'''Larrys Creek''' is a {{convert|22.9|mi|km|1|sing=on}} long [[tributary]] of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]] in [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. A part of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] [[drainage basin]], the Larrys Creek watershed drains {{convert|89.1|sqmi|sqkm|1}} in six [[Township (Pennsylvania)|townships]] and a [[borough]]. The creek flows south from the [[dissected plateau|dissected]] [[Allegheny Plateau]] to the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians]] through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the [[Devonian]], [[Mississippian]], and [[Pennsylvanian]] periods.

The first recorded inhabitants were the [[Susquehannock]]s, followed by the [[Lenape]] and other tribes. The [[Great Shamokin Path]] crossed the creek near its mouth, where Larry Burt, the first settler, (for whom Larrys Creek is named) also lived by 1769. In the 19th century, the creek and its watershed were a center of the lumber and other industries, including 53 sawmills, grist mills, leather [[tanning|tanneries]], coal and iron mines. No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. For transportation, a [[plank road]] ran along much of the creek for decades, and two "[[paper railroad]]s" were planned, but never built. 

As of 2006, the Larrys Creek watershed is 83.1% forest and 15.7% agricultural (in marked contrast to the 19th century's [[Clearfelling|clear-cut]] land). Nearly {{convert|9000|acre|sqkm|0}} of second-growth forest are [[protected area|protected]] public and private land for [[hunting]] and trout [[fishing]], with more land protected in parts of [[Tiadaghton State Forest]]. The polluting industries of the 19th century are gone and Larrys Creek "has an exceptionally scenic, ultra-highwater, whitewater run" for [[canoeing]].<ref name="canoe">{{cite book

==Name==
Larrys Creek is named for Larry Burt, the first settler in the area, who lived near the mouth of the creek near what is now the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Larrys Creek in [[Piatt Township, Pennsylvania|Piatt Township]]. He traded with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and according to tradition had a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] wife. Larry Burt was already there when surveyors came through in 1769 (after the land was purchased in the first [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]), but disappeared sometime soon after, perhaps moving west with the Native Americans who left the area.<ref name="history">

The creek next heads due south through [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]] Number 114. There it runs for about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} without a road beside it. It passes through [[Mifflin Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Mifflin Township]] for a short distance and heads southeast into [[Anthony Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Anthony Township]], where it leaves the State Game Lands and passes a water filtration plant (there is a {{convert|6|ft|m|0|sing=on}} dam here).<ref name="canoe"/> Further south, it receives Roaring Run (on the [[left bank]]). Roaring Run receives the only acid mine drainage in the watershed and enters Larrys Creek {{convert|10.4|mi|km|1}} from the mouth. 

Larrys Creek then heads southwest back into Mifflin Township, where it passes through the borough of [[Salladasburg, Pennsylvania|Salladasburg]], with [[Pennsylvania Route 973]] running parallel to the creek from the township line to the borough. At Salladasburg, Larrys Creek receives its major tributary, the Second Fork of Larrys Creek, on the [[right bank]] {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1}} from the mouth. 

The Second Fork has its source in extreme southern [[Pine Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Pine Township]] and runs south through Cogan House Township and the village of Brookside, then a few miles through [[Cummings Township, Pennsylvania|Cummings Township]], and last through Mifflin Township and Salladasburg. Lawshe Run is its major tributary. [[Pennsylvania Route 287]] runs parallel to the Second Fork its whole length, and continues parallel to Larrys Creek from Salladasburg south to its terminus on [[U.S. Route 220]] (near the creek's mouth). 

Just south of Salladasburg, Larrys Creek receives the First Fork of Larrys Creek, {{convert|4.2|mi|km|1}} from the mouth. The First Fork has its source in Cummings Township and flows south-southeast into Mifflin Township. {{convert|2.8|mi|km|1}} from its mouth Larrys Creek receives Canoe Run. Both these tributaries enter on the right bank. 

Larrys Creek then enters Piatt Township, flowing east around a ridge and through the village of Larryville where it receives Seeley Run on the left bank, {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} from the mouth. It next flows back southwest, then south to the hamlet of Larrys Creek, where it has its [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] with the West Branch Susquehanna River, {{convert|2.6|mi|km|0}} east of the borough of [[Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania|Jersey Shore]].<ref name="usgs"/><ref name="mouth">{{cite news

The elevation at the source of Larrys Creek is {{convert|1740|ft|m|0}}, while the mouth is at an elevation of {{convert|515|ft|m|0}}. The difference in elevation, {{convert|1225|ft|m|0}}, divided by the length of the creek, {{convert|22.9|mi|km|1}}, gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or [[relief ratio]] of 53.5&nbsp;feet/mile (10.1&nbsp;m/km).

</ref> 

'''Tributaries:''' The major smaller streams in the Larrys Creek watershed include the First and Second Forks of Larrys Creek, Roaring Run, Lawshe Run, and Canoe Run. The Second Fork of Larrys Creek is the largest tributary, with a watershed of {{convert|24.9|sqmi|sqkm|1}} or 28.0% of the total watershed. The First Fork is next largest, with a watershed of {{convert|17.6|sqmi|sqkm|1}} or 19.8% of the total. Roaring Run accounts for 5.7% of the total watershed with {{convert|5.1|sqmi|sqkm|1}} and other tributaries are less than 5% of the total.<ref name="river miles"/> 

Starting at the mouth, the tributaries of Larrys Creek are: unnamed (in Geiler Hollow), Seeley Run (or Seely Run), Canoe Run, First Fork, Second Fork, unnamed, Marsh Run, Roaring Run, Long Run, Wendell Run, Crayton Hollow Run, unnamed, Wolf Run, Dibber Hollow Run, unnamed, Birch Run, and unnamed. 

===Water quality and pollution===
The [[clearfelling|clear-cutting]] of forests in the 19th century adversely affected the ecology of the Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality.<ref>{{cite web

The mean annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] for Larrys Creek is 40 to 42&nbsp;inches (1016 to 1067&nbsp;mm).<ref name="Streams II"/> Pennsylvania receives the most [[acid rain]] of any state in the United States. Because Larrys Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, it has a relatively low capacity to [[Neutralization|neutralize]] added acid. This makes it especially vulnerable to increased acidification from acid rain, which poses a threat to the long term threat to the health of the plants and animals in the creek.<ref>{{cite web

===Water filtration plant===
The [[Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania|Jersey Shore]] Area Joint Water Authority’s water filtration plant is on Larrys Creek, near the border between Mifflin and Anthony Townships. The plant has been there since at least 1914 and provides water from the creek to 2,500 industrial and residential customers in the boroughs of Jersey Shore and Salladasburg, as well as Anthony, Mifflin, [[Nippenose Township, Pennsylvania|Nippenose]], Piatt, and [[Porter Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Porter Township]]s in southwestern Lycoming County, and [[Pine Creek Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Pine Creek Township]] in the southeastern part of neighboring  [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="water">{{cite news

==History==
===Early inhabitants===
Two [[Clovis point]]s found in the Salladasburg area in a "stream site" are the earliest evidence of human activity along Larrys Creek (''circa'' 10,000 [[Common Era|BCE]]).<ref>{{cite book | last = Fogleman |first = Gary L. |coauthors=  Johnston, Richard P. |title= Fluted Points in Lycoming County |year= 1987 |publisher= Fogleman Publishing Co. |location= [[Turbotville, Pennsylvania]]}} No ISBN</ref> The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the [[Iroquoian]] speaking [[Susquehannock]]s. Their name meant "people of the muddy river" in [[Algonquin]].  [[decimate|Decimated]] by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River Valley]] were then chiefly occupied by the [[Munsee]] [[phratry]] of the Lenape (or Delaware), and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the [[Iroquois]]. The Great Shamokin Path crossed the creek at a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] near its mouth; however, no trails of the indigenous peoples are recorded as having followed Larrys Creek north.<ref name="path">{{cite book

The [[United Kingdom|British]] purchased land from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement. However, the [[Line of Property]] (or [[Purchase Line]]) border defined by "Tiadaghton Creek" dividing colonial and Native American lands was disputed. The colonists claimed this was Pine Creek, the Iroquois and other tribes Lycoming Creek. Larrys Creek was in the disputed territory between these, so the illegal settlers there were part of the "[[Fair Play Men]]" system of self-government, with their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on [[July 4]], [[1776]].

In the [[American Revolutionary War]], settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and Native Americans allied with the British. After the [[Wyoming Valley battle and massacre]] in the summer of 1778 (near what is now [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]]) and smaller local attacks, the "[[The Big Runaway|Big Runaway]]" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to [[Muncy, Pennsylvania|Muncy]], then further south to [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]]. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the "Little Runaway". [[Sullivan's Expedition]] helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war.<ref name="picture">{{cite book

On [[April 13]], [[1795]], Lycoming County was formed from [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]], prompting further growth. In 1800, the "State Road" was the second major road built in the county and followed part of Larrys Creek in Cogan House Township as it ran from Newberry (the western part of Williamsport today) north to the Pennsylvania-[[New York]] state line near [[Painted Post, New York]]. Larrys Creek had a bridge near the mouth by 1806, the first of the major creeks in the county for which a bridge is mentioned.<ref name="history"/>

===Lumber===
[[Image:Larrys_Creek.JPG|thumb|250 px|Larrys Creek in Cogan House Township, heading south into State Game Lands. Most such land was acquired by the state after being clear cut.]]
Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish [[homesteading|homesteads]] and farms.  As timber and [[lumber]] became a major industry in the mid-19th century, Larrys Creek was a source of power for [[sawmills]] and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek in what is now Mifflin Township was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).<ref name="history"/> 

This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek lead to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within {{convert|22|mi|km|0}} of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were [[steam power]]ed (the rest were [[water power]]ed). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.<ref name ="sawmills"/>

Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On [[May 2]], [[1872]] a large [[forest fire]] destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the watershed today.

===Paper railroads===
Two "paper railroads" were proposed for Larrys Creek: the "Larry's Creek Railroad and Coal Company", incorporated [[June 24]], [[1839]] to hold {{convert|2000|acre|sqkm|2}} and operate up to {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} of railroad from the mouth of the creek north to the coal mines; and the "Jersey Shore, Pine Creek & State Line Railroad", incorporated on [[April 11]], [[1853]] to run north from Jersey Shore up Pine Creek to [[Tioga, Pennsylvania|Tioga]] or Long Run, and thence to the New York state line. Its charter was amended [[April 4]], [[1854]] to run up [[Marsh Creek (Pine Creek)|Marsh Creek]] (then known as the Third Fork Pine Creek) and [[Crooked Creek (Pennsylvania)|Crooked Creek]] to the Tioga Railroad, and again on [[March 26]], [[1856]] to run up Little Pine Creek (then known as First Fork Pine Creek) to the Larrys Creek Plank Road and then up Blockhouse Creek to [[Blossburg, Pennsylvania|Blossburg]]. It was still corporately alive in 1865, but the charter of the "[[Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway]]" in 1870 (New York City-Reading interests) superseded it. Neither railroad was actually ever built.<ref name="taber atlas">{{cite book

===Plank road===
[[Image:Puncheon.jpg|thumb|250 px|left|Diagram of a plank road or puncheon.]]

In 1851 a plank road or [[plank road|puncheon]] was built along Larrys Creek from the village of Larrys Creek at the creek's mouth north to Salladasburg, then later along the Second Fork of Larrys Creek and on to the village of Brookside in Cogan House Township. It was later extended north to the village of White Pine and finally to the village of English Center in Pine Township. (This route is basically the location of Route 287 today). A spur of the plank road along Larrys Creek into Anthony Township was also built, but it is not known how far it extended.<ref name="plank">{{cite journal

The plank road was a [[toll road]] run by "The Larrys Creek Plank Road Company", a corporation founded [[May 8]], [[1850]]. It served the sawmills, grist mills, mines, and leather tanneries along the creek. There was a connection to the railroad and the West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania [[Canal]] at the hamlet of Larrys Creek, as well as the West Branch Susquehanna River.

At that time, [[Tsuga|hemlock]] tree bark was used in tanning leather, but the wood was not used much for lumber, so hundreds of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were left to rot. The timber industry in Lycoming County also meant that there were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available. The hemlock logs were a source of cheap lumber to build the plank road.

The earth under the plank road was first graded, then ties (similar to those used for railroad tracks) were set into the ground. Next long narrow stringers (similar to rails on a railroad track) were nailed to the ties, with a distance between stringers of about {{convert|6|ft|m|1}}. The road surface consisted of planks about {{convert|8|ft|m|1}} wide nailed to the stringers and was fairly smooth. The road had turnoffs (as it was not wide enough for horse drawn vehicles to pass each other). [[Toll house]]s were at regular intervals, with variable tolls for pedestrians, riders on horseback and various carts and wagons. No toll schedule has survived.

The plank road was operational for about 38 years when a major flood on [[June 1]], [[1889]] washed out much of it. The Larrys Creek covered bridge still standing in Cogan House Township was one of the few bridges to survive this flood (fallen trees upstream formed a dam which helped protect it).<ref name="now and then"/> It is one of only three 19th century covered bridges remaining in the county today (the others are in [[Jackson Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Jackson Township]] over [[Little Pine Creek|Blockhouse Creek]] and [[Moreland Township, Pennsylvania|Moreland Township]] over [[Little Muncy Creek]]).<ref name="bridge"/>  The flood also destroyed the West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania Canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the [[Johnstown Flood]], which killed over 2200 people.<ref name="history"/>
[[Image:Plank_Road_Sign.JPG|thumb|250 px|Today the name is all that remains of the Larrys Creek Plank Road.]] 
By 1889 most of the original forests in the county had been [[clear cut]], so no cheap source of wood was available as before. While the road from Salladasburg south to the West Branch Susquehanna River was repaired and rebuilt, the rest was not. In 1900 the county courts recognized a [[petition]] to end tolls on this last portion of the road. The corporation was dissolved and the road and its maintenance passed to the county. As sections of plank road wore out they were replaced by graded dirt and gravel, so that it soon became a regular road. The plank road operated as a toll road for about 49 years.<ref name="plank"/> Today only the "Plank Road" name survives, in a {{convert|0.6|mi|km|1|sing=on}} section of road that runs north from U.S. Route 220, parallel to State Route 287.<ref name="tributaries"/>
