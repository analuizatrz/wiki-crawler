The '''1933 Atlantic hurricane season''' is the second most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, with 21 storms forming during that year. The season, which began on [[June 1]], [[1933]] and lasted until [[November 30]], [[1933]], is surpassed only by the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]], which broke the record with its 28 storms. The 1933 season saw tropical activity before its start, and a tropical cyclone was active for all but 13 days from [[June 28]] to [[October 7]]. Tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes, especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration, may have remained undetected. Because technologies such as [[satellite imagery|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the [[1960s]], historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. Compensating for the lack of reliable observation, one hurricane researcher estimates the season produced 24 tropical cyclones.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea|year=2007|title=Counting Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Back to 1900|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2007-07-23|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/landsea-eos-may012007.pdf}}</ref>

Ten of the season's 21 storms attained [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] status. Five of those were major hurricanes, with sustained winds of over 111&nbsp;[[mph]] (179&nbsp;[[km/h]]); the strongest reached peak winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h) near the [[Bahamas]] in early October. The season produced several deadly storms, with eight storms killing more than 20&nbsp;people. All but one of the 21 known storms affected land at some point during their lifetimes.

==Season summary==
[[Image:Stormking2.jpg|right|thumb|Damage from Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane]]
The 1933 season was the most active of its time, surpassing the previous record-holder of 19 storms in [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887]]. Nineteen of the season's storms made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] as tropical cyclones, and another struck land as an extratropical storm. Eight tropical storms, including six hurricanes, hit the [[United States]] during the season, including the [[1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane|Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane]], which the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|U.S. Weather Bureau]] describes as one of the most severe in history along the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. Seven tropical storms, including four hurricanes, hit [[Mexico]], two of which caused severe damage in the [[Tampico]] area.<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Charles L. Mitchell|year=1933|title=1933 Monthly Weather Review|publisher=U.S. Weather Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-07|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1933.pdf}}</ref>

The season was continuously active, with a record-setting total of seven storms forming during the month of August alone. This record was later tied by the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]] and ultimately broken by the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004 season]] with its eight August storms.<ref name="augsum">{{cite web|author=Lawrence, Franklin, Avila, Beven, Pasch, & Stewart|year=2006|title=Tropical Weather Summary of August 2004|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-09-19|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/tws/MIATWSAT_aug.shtml?}}</ref> At the time, many storms received the distinction of being the earliest ''n''th storm to form, such as the earliest fifth tropical storm to form in a season. Though most of the records were broken in later years, the 1933 season retains the record for the earliest formation of a season's 18th storm by 27&nbsp;hours.<ref name="andyhatzos">{{cite web|author=Andy Hatzos|year=2006|title=Earliest Hurricane Research|accessdate=2006-09-19|url=http://pipsey.net:8080/~thegreatzo/hurricanes.html}}</ref>

During the season, the U.S. [[Weather Bureau]] issued [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Warning|storm]] and [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Hurricane Warning|hurricane warnings]] for eight storms, including coastal portions of [[Texas]], as well as from [[Florida]] to [[Massachusetts]], forcing the evacuations of thousands of people. The deadliest storm of the season was a hurricane that struck [[Tampico]], [[Mexico]], killing over 184&nbsp;residents. The costliest hurricane was the [[1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane|Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane]], which caused $27&nbsp;million in damage (1933 [[USD]], $360&nbsp;million 2005 USD) from [[North Carolina]] to [[New Jersey]]. The hurricane produced rainfall that resulted in severe crop damage in [[Maryland]].<ref name="mwr"/>

The first storm of the season formed on [[May 14]] in the western [[Caribbean Sea]], prior to the official start of the [[Atlantic hurricane]] season. It moved quickly towards the northwest and attained a peak intensity of 45&nbsp;[[mph]] (70&nbsp;km/h) on [[May 16]]. The storm turned to the west, then curved southwest, while moving around the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] just offshore. The tropical storm turned to the south, weakened to a tropical depression, and made landfall on northern [[Tabasco]]. It dissipated on [[May 19]].<ref name="unisys">{{cite web|author=Unisys Corporation|year=2006|title=1933 Atlantic hurricane season|accessdate=2006-09-07|url=http://www.weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/1933/index.html}}</ref>

The hurricane season officially began on [[June 1]], but there was little detectable activity during most of June. That tranquility came to an end on [[June 27]], when a tropical storm was first observed just off the coast of northern [[Guyana]]. It strengthened as it moved west-northwestward, and it became a hurricane later that day. Continuing to the west-northwest, the hurricane brushed southern [[Tobago]] and made landfall on northeastern [[Venezuela]] on [[June 28]], becoming the earliest known tropical cyclone to affect the area.<ref name="mwr"/> The system weakened to a tropical storm over land but re-attained hurricane status on [[July 1]] while in the western [[Caribbean Sea]]. The hurricane curved to the northwest and moved over western [[Cuba]] on [[July 3]]. It turned to the west in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and reached a peak intensity of 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h) on [[July 5]], making it a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2]] hurricane. The hurricane turned to the west-southwest due to a building [[ridge (meteorology)|high pressure area]] to its north then weakened. It made landfall on the coast of [[Tamaulipas]] and weakened to tropical storm status. The system finally dissipated over land on [[July 7]].<ref name="unisys"/>

On southern Tobago, the hurricane caused severe damage, amounting to around $3&nbsp;million (1933 USD). 13&nbsp;people were killed on the island, and another 1,000 were left homeless. In northeastern Venezuela, the hurricane destroyed many houses, businesses, and boats, and strong winds downed power lines. Many people were killed, and property damage totaled to over $386,000 (1933 USD).<ref name="mwr"/> In Cuba, the storm killed 22&nbsp;people, while damage amounted to $4&nbsp;million (1933 USD).<ref name="Cuba">{{cite web|author=Pielke, Rubiera, Landsea, Fernandez, & Klien|year=2003|title=Hurricane Vulnerability in Latin America & The Caribbean|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/NHR-Cuba.pdf}}</ref> The hurricane caused severe damage and several deaths in northeastern [[Mexico]].<ref name="mwr"/> In all, the hurricane killed 35&nbsp;people.<ref name="deadliest">{{cite web|author=Rappaport & Partagas|year=1997|title=The Deadliest Atlantic Hurricanes, 1492–1996|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-09-19|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastdeadly.shtml}}</ref>

The third tropical storm of the season was first observed on [[July 14]] near [[St. Kitts]]. It moved quickly westward and passed just south of [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Hispaniola]] as a weak storm. The system curved slightly to the west-northwest and brushed the northern coast of [[Jamaica]] before turning slightly westward and hitting the [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Quintana Roo]]. As it crossed the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] the cyclone weakened, and after crossing the [[Bay of Campeche]] the storm dissipated over coastal [[Veracruz]].<ref name="unisys"/> 

While passing near Jamaica, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, including 9&nbsp;inches (230&nbsp;mm) in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] which led to flooding and washouts. The rainfall also damaged several bridges and roads and resulting in delays in train schedules.<ref name="july181933">{{cite web|author=The Daily Gleaner|publishdate=1933-07-18|title=Torrential Rains Create Havoc in Kingston and St. Andrews|accessdate=2006-09-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/FullViewer.aspx?img=P9SpTvomPU+KID/6NLMW2o3JQ+mIMY1lsicqePOCHKn5p6QUxakzMQ==}}</ref> Mudslides and overflowing rivers flooded several towns with knee-deep waters.

On [[July 21]], another tropical storm formed, this time, in the central Gulf of Mexico to the northwest of the Yucatán Peninsula. It moved quickly to the northwest, and made landfall near [[Matagorda Bay]], in [[Texas]] on [[July 23]] as a 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm. The system turned to the northeast, and became extratropical to the east of [[Dallas, Texas]]. The extratropical system moved slowly through northern [[Louisiana]], turned to the northeast, and dissipated over northeastern [[Arkansas]] near [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name="mwr"/> 

Prior to the arrival of the storm, numerous coastal residents boarded up their houses and businesses and voluntarily evacuated further inland.

On [[July 25]], two days after the remnants of Tropical Storm 4 dissipated, another tropical storm was detected. Located to the southeast of [[Antigua]], it tracked west-northwestward, passing near [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] with winds of up to 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h). The storm strengthened and attained hurricane status the next day north of [[Puerto Rico]], and it continued its west-northwest movement. After moving through the northern [[Bahamas]], the hurricane struck near [[Fort Pierce, Florida]], with winds of 85&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h). 

The hurricane crossed the state and weakened to minimal tropical storm intensity. It turned to the west-southwest and re-strengthened to a hurricane on [[August 4]] off the coast of [[Texas]]. It weakened again to tropical storm status and made its final landfall near [[Brownsville, Texas]], on [[August 5]] as a strong tropical storm. The system rapidly dissipated over northern [[Mexico]].<ref name="mwr"/>

On [[Trinidad]], rainfall from Tropical Storms 6 and 7—the heaviest in 9&nbsp;years—caused rivers to overflow and flooded parts of the island. Several boats were damaged or driven ashore from rough seas. The two storms caused damage to fields, highways, and houses, and caused the loss of crops such as [[cocoa]] and [[banana]]s.

A ship first reported the season's eighth tropical storm about 900&nbsp;miles (1450&nbsp;) east of [[Puerto Rico]] on [[August 17]]. This system would become one of the most destructive hurricanes of the season. The storm moved towards the northwest and quickly attained hurricane status late that same day. The hurricane continued to strengthen, and on [[August 21]], it passed about 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Bermuda]] as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2 hurricane]]. [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] avoided a direct hit but reported wind speeds of up to 64&nbsp;mph (103&nbsp;km/h). On [[August 22]], the hurricane turned west-northwest and reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h), equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane in the modern-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. However, it weakened quickly afterwards. On [[August 23]], the storm made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] as a Category 2 hurricane and continued to quickly weaken as it moved inland, away from its energy source.<ref name="NOAA1">{{cite web|author=Blake, Rappaport, and Landsea|year=2006|title=The Deadliest, Costliest, and Most Intense United States Tropical Cyclones (1851 to 2006)|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2007-06-08|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/NWS-TPC-5.pdf}}</ref> The storm turned to the north, then to the northeast, passing through [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]] before weakening to a tropical depression over [[New York]].

At approximately the same time on [[August 26]], another area of disturbed weather organized into the season's tenth tropical storm in the [[Bay of Campeche]]. It initially moved to the northwest. The cyclone remained a minimal tropical storm for most of its lifetime. On [[August 29]], the storm turned to the west-southwest and made landfall near Tampico, Mexico, dissipating shortly thereafter. The tropical storm caused heavy rains near the coast, although winds were minor.

The eighth tropical storm in [[August]], and the seventh to form in 30 days, was first observed on [[August 31]] 225&nbsp;miles (360&nbsp;km) north-northeast of the island of [[Antigua]]. The storm rapidly intensified as it moved quickly to the west-northwest, attaining hurricane status later that day, and major hurricane strength on [[September 1]], while located to the north of [[Puerto Rico]]. It continued west-northwestward and attained its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), on [[September 2]]. The hurricane, then at Category 4 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], moved through the northern Bahamas at peak intensity and weakened slightly before making landfall on [[Jupiter, Florida]], with winds of 125&nbsp;mph (200&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 4]]. The system weakened rapidly over [[Florida]] to tropical storm status, and after turning to the north, decelerated.

On [[September 10]], as Hurricane 13 was intensifying over the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, another area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical storm over the western [[Caribbean Sea]] off the coast of [[Guatemala]]. It moved slowly northward and strengthened, becoming a hurricane on [[September 12]] just east of [[Belize]]. On the next day, the hurricane made landfall on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Quintana Roo]], and the system weakened to a tropical storm as it moved northwestward across the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. On [[September 14]] it again regained hurricane status over the [[Bay of Campeche]]. The hurricane struck [[Tampico]] on [[September 15]] and then dissipated.<ref name="mwr"/> 

The storm caused severe damage in Tampico and further inland, leaving several thousand homeless. According to ''The New York Times'', at least 67&nbsp;people were killed.

Almost simultaneous to Hurricane 19, a tropical storm developed a short distance east of the central [[Bahamas]] on [[October 26]]. It moved north-northeastward, then northeastward, steadily strengthening along its path. On [[October 27]], a [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of 993&nbsp;[[mbar]] (29.32&nbsp;inHg) was recorded within the storm, and on [[October 28]] the storm reached a peak intensity of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h). On [[October 29]], the storm became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] and turned north to hit [[Nova Scotia]]. Wedged between two [[ridge (meteorology)|high pressure systems]], it continued northward until dissipating over extreme eastern portions of [[Quebec]] on [[October 30]].<ref name="octmwr">{{cite web|author=Willis E.

In [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], the storm's moderately powerful winds downed telephone and telegraph wires and uproofed several buildings. Heavy seas caused by the storm damaged or destroyed many boats, and rainfall flooded highways across the province.<ref name="oct301933canada">{{cite web|author=UP|publishdate=1933-10-30|title=Hurricane Leaves Path of Wreckage Across Nova Scotia|accessdate=2006-10-02|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=39727926&firstvisit=true&currentResult=1&currentPage=0}}</ref>

After another calm period, the final tropical storm of the season was first observed on [[November 15]] in the southwestern [[Caribbean Sea]]. It moved slowly westward, never strengthening beyond a minimal tropical storm in its short lifetime. On [[November 16]], it struck the southeastern coast of [[Nicaragua]], and it dissipated soon after on [[November 17]].<ref name="unisys"/>

==Accumulated Cyclone Energy Rating (ACE)==

The table below shows the [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|ACE]] for each storm in the season. Broadly speaking, the ACE is a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the duration of its lifetime; thus, hurricanes that lasted a long time (such as Thirteen and Eighteen) have higher ACEs. The ACE rating is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 35 knots (39 mph/63 km/h) or tropical storm strength.
