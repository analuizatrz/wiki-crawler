"'''Smells Like Teen Spirit'''" is a song by [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and the [[opening track]] and lead [[Single (music)|single]] from the band's [[1991]] breakthrough album ''[[Nevermind]]''. Written by [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Krist Novoselic]], and [[Dave Grohl]] and produced by [[Butch Vig]], "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is commonly regarded as the song that brought [[alternative rock]] and [[Grunge music|grunge]] music to prominence worldwide, and served as an anthem for [[Generation X]].<ref name="SOS">{{cite web | author=Sold On Song Top 100 | year=| title="Smells Like Teen Spirit" | work=BBC.co.uk| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/smellsliketeenspirit.shtml| accessdate=October 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The band's first and biggest hit, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" reached #1 on charts around the world in 1991. "Teen Spirit" reached #6 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]], and it topped the magazine's [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. It was voted best single of the year in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll.  The video for the song received heavy airplay and won the band "Best New Artist" and "Best Alternative Group" awards at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=2006| title="Past Winners Database" | work=Los Angeles Times| url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1992/1992mtvv.htm| accessdate=October 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Over the years, listeners and critics have praised "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest rock songs ever.

==Origins and recording==

In a January [[1994]] ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interview, Kurt Cobain admitted that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was an attempt to write a song in the style of the [[Pixies]], a band he greatly admired. Cobain said:<ref name=pixies>Fricke, David. "Kurt Cobain: The Rolling Stone Interview." ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[January 27]], [[1994]]</ref> 

{{cquote|I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band &mdash; or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.}}

Cobain had only started writing the song a few weeks before recording was due to start on their second album, later to be titled ''Nevermind''.<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana''. Doubleday, 1993.  ISBN 0-385-47199-8, pg. 175</ref> When he first presented the song (which at that point only consisted of the main riff and the chorus vocal melody)<ref name="az176">Azerrad, pg. 176</ref><ref name=rsslts>"Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit." ''Rolling Stone''. [[December 7]], [[2000]].</ref> to his bandmates, bassist Krist Novoselic commented he thought it was "ridiculous"; Cobain consequently made the band play it repeatedly for "an hour and a half".<ref name=pixies /> Novoselic recalled in 2001 that after playing the riff over and over again, he said "'Wait a minute. Why don't we just kind of slow this down a bit?' So I started playing the verse part. And Dave [started] playing a drum beat".<ref name=requiem>Cross, Charles. "Requiem for a Dream". ''[[Guitar World]]''.  October 2001.</ref> As a result all three band members are credited as songwriters.

Cobain got the song name when friend [[Kathleen Hanna]], lead singer of the [[riot grrrl]] punk band [[Bikini Kill]] at the time, spray painted "Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit" on his wall. Since they had been talking about [[anarchism]], [[punk rock]] and similar topics, Cobain took it to be a slogan in that vein. The meaning, however, was that Kurt smelled like "[[Teen Spirit (deodorant)|Teen Spirit]]", the deodorant that [[Tobi Vail]], Hanna's bandmate and Kurt's then-girlfriend, wore. Cobain claimed that he did not know it was a brand of deodorant until months after the single was released.<ref>Azerrad, pg. 211-12</ref>

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was, along with "[[Come as You Are]]", one of a few new songs to be recorded during the ''Nevermind'' sessions.<ref>Azerrad, pg. 167</ref> Nirvana recorded "Smells Like Teen Spirit" at Sound City recording studio in [[Van Nuys]], [[California]] with producer Butch Vig in May of 1991.<ref>Cross, Charles. "The Stories Behind the Songs". ''Rolling Stone''. [[November 14]], [[2002]]</ref>  Prior to recording, the band had given Vig a rough cassette demo recording of "Teen Spirit". Vig suggested some minor arrangement changes to the song, such as moving a guitar ad lib into the chorus and trimming down the chorus length.<ref>di Perna, Alan. "The Making of ''Nevermind''". ''Guitar World''. Fall 1996.</ref>  The band recorded the basic track of the song in three takes, keeping the second one.<ref name=rsslts />

==Composition==
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" is written in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[F minor]], with the main riff constructed from four [[power chords]], (F-Bb-Ab-Db), played in a [[syncopation|syncopated]] 16th note strum. The chords occasionally lapse into [[Added tone chord|suspended chord]] voicings as a result of Cobain playing the bottom four strings of the guitar for the thickness of sound.<ref>Chappell, Jon. "Nirvana's Music". ''Guitar'' magazine. June 1993.</ref> The US rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] has noted that the famous opening [[riff]] of the song resembles the celebrated riff from the [[1963]] cover version by [[The Kingsmen]] of [[Richard Berry]]'s song "[[Louie Louie]]."<ref> Marsh, Dave. ''Louie Louie'', University of Michigan Press, 2004 ISBN 0-472-03023-X </ref> Comparisons have also been made by listeners to [[Boston (band)|Boston's]] 1976 hit "[[More Than a Feeling]]".<ref name="az176"/> Cobain himself held similar opinions, saying that it "was such a cliched riff. It was so close to a Boston riff or 'Louie Louie.'"<ref name=pixies />

While melodically and harmonically simple, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is structured around an alternating loud/quiet dynamic that shifts from minimalistic, moody verses to loud chorus sections. The song begins with Cobain strumming the main riff solo, adding [[Guitar effects#Distortion|distortion]] when the rest of the band joins in. During the verse Cobain plays a sparse two-note guitar line over Novoselic's eight-note bassline pulse, which outlines the chord progression. The band builds up to the chorus as Cobain begins to play the same two notes on every beat of the measure and repeats the phrase "Hello, hello, hello, how low?" The band then launches into an explosive chorus where Cobain resumes the main guitar riff and screams the lyrics. After the second chorus, Cobain plays a guitar solo that resembles his vocal melody from the verse. The band extends the third and final verse and chorus as Cobain sings the refrain "A denial" repeatedly. The song ends with the feedback of the guitar.

==Release, success, and acclaim==
The "Smells Like Teen Spirit" single was released on [[September 10]], [[1991]] as the lead single from ''Nevermind''. The song was not expected to be a hit. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was meant to be the base-building alternative rock cut, while  the subsequent single "Come as You Are" was expected to be the song that could cross over to other radio formats. However, [[campus radio]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations picked up on the song and put it into heavy rotation. Danny Goldberg of Nirvana's management firm Gold Mountain said "None of us heard it as a crossover song, but the public heard it and it was instantaneous [. . .] They heard it on alternative radio, and then they rushed out like lemmings to buy it."<ref>Azerrad, pg. 227</ref> The video received a world premiere on [[MTV]]'s late-night alternative rock program ''[[120 Minutes]]'', but soon proved so popular the channel began to air it during its regular daytime rotation.<ref>Azerrad, pg. 199</ref> As a result, ''Nevermind'' began selling thousands of copies a week, culminating in the album knocking [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Dangerous (album)|Dangerous]]'' album from the top spot on the ''Billboard'' charts in January of 1992.

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" received much critical acclaim.  It topped the 1991 year-end polls for the ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine, and reached number two on ''Rolling Stone's'' list of best singles of the year.  The single topped out at #6 on the singles chart the same week ''Nevermind'' reached #1;<ref>"Nirvana Achieves Chart Perfection!" ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''. [[January 25]], [[1992]].</ref> it also hit number one on the Modern Rock Tacks chart and has since been [[RIAA single certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Basham, David | year=2001| title=Got Charts?

Still, many American Top 40 stations at the time were reluctant to play the song in regular rotation due to its sound and restricted it to night-time play.<ref>Ross, Sean. "Nirvana Receiving Less-Than-Spirited Airplay." ''Billboard''. [[February 1]], [[1992]].</ref> 

The song was nominated for two Grammy awards: [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]], losing to "[[Give it Away]]" by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers|The Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and "[[Layla]]" by [[Eric Clapton]] respectively. The loss to Clapton would later be named one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history by [[Entertainment Weekly]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2007| title="Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets" | format=http | work=EW.com | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_1,00.html | accessdate=February 13 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

In the wake of Nirvana's success, [[Michael Azerrad]] wrote in a 1992 ''Rolling Stone'' article that "'Smells Like Teen Spirit' is an anthem for (or is it against?) the 'Why Ask Why?' generation. Just don't call Cobain a spokesman for a generation."<ref>Azerrad, Michael. "Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana". ''Rolling Stone''. [[April 16]], [[1992]].</ref>  Nevertheless, the music media eventually awarded the song "anthem-of-a-generation" status and with it Cobain became a reluctant spokesman for Generation X.<ref>Garofalo, Reebee. ''Rockin' Out: Popular Music in the USA''. Allyn & Bacon, 1997. ISBN 0-205-13703-2, pg. 447</ref> The band grew uncomfortable with the success of the song and in later shows often pointedly excluded it from show setlists.<ref>Crisafulli, Chuck. ''Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song''. Carlton, 1996. ISBN 0-684-83356-5, pg. 38</ref> Cobain said in 1994, "I still like playing 'Teen Spirit,' but itâ€™s almost an embarrassment to play it [. . .] Everyone has focused on that song so much."<ref name=pixies />

Since its release, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" has continued to garner critical acclaim. In 2002 ''[[NME]]'' magazine ranked the song number two on its list of "100 Greatest Singles of All Time."<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2002| title=''NME's'' 100 Greatest Singles of All Time Unveiled | format=http | work=nme.com | url=http://www.nme.com/news/103493.htm | accessdate=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In 2003, [[VH1]] placed "Smells Like Teen Spirit" at number one on its list of "100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years."<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2003| title="VH1's 100 Greatest Songs" | format=http | work=cbsnews.com | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/06/10/entertainment/main557973.shtml | accessdate=October 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The song also ranked third in a ''[[Q Magazine]]'' poll that year.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2003| title=U2's One named 'greatest record' | format=http | work=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3281327.stm | accessdate=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' ranked "Smells Like Teen Spirit" ninth in its list ''[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]'' in 2004, describing the song's impact as "A shock wave of big-amp purity, [it] wiped the lingering jive of the Eighties off the pop map overnight."<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2004| title="Smells Like Teen Spirit" | format=http | work=rollingstone.com | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595854/smells_like_teen_spirit | accessdate=October 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In the 2006 [[VH1 UK]] poll ''The Nation's Favourite Lyric'', the line "I feel stupid and contagious/here we are now, entertain us" from song's chorus was ranked as the third-favorite song lyric among the over 13,000 voters from the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title="U2 cop nation's favourite lyric" | format=http | work=itv.com | url=http://www.itv.com/news/entertainment_1646059.html | accessdate=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Song meaning==

The lyrics to "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as Cobain sang them were often difficult for listeners to decipher, both because of their nonsensicality and Cobain's guttural, slurred speech. This problem was compounded by the fact that the ''Nevermind'' album liner did not include lyrics for the song, simply random lyrical fragments. As a result of the confusion, MTV prepared a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which aired when the video was added to heavy rotation.<ref>Azerrad, pg. 199</ref> Lyrics for the album (some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs) were finally released in the liner notes of the "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]" single.

The song is widely interpreted to be about a [[Teenager|teen]] revolution, an interpretation reinforced by the song's music video.<ref>Chrisafulli, pg. 38</ref>  When discussing the song in Michael Azerrad's biography ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'', Cobain said, "I felt a duty to describe what I felt about my surroundings and my generation and people my age."<ref>Azerrad, pg. 211</ref> The book ''Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song'' describes "Teen Spirit" as "a typically murky Cobain exploration of meaning and meaninglessness."<ref>Chrisafulli, pg. 37</ref>  Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain's contradictory lyrics (such as "It's fun to lose and to pretend") and states "the point that emerges isn't just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator--he's angry that he's confused."  Azerrad's conclusion is that the song is "alternately a sarcastic reaction to the idea of actually having a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea."<ref>Azerrad, pg. 213</ref>

In ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]'', Charles Cross' biography of Kurt Cobain, an argument is made that the song is a reference to Cobain's break-up with [[Tobi Vail]].<ref>Cross, Charles. ''Heavier Than Heaven''. Hyperion, 2001. ISBN 0-7868-6505-9, pg. 169</ref> This argument is backed up by lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, which can be seen in Cobain's ''Journals'', such as "Why don't you cry when I'm away / Oh yeah we want what's best for you" and "Who will be the King & Queen of the outcasted [sic] teens" He also referred to the preppy teens at his high school, who "always sat on the heater complaining about the heat." He said, "They just pissed me off and I wanted to let them know."<ref>Cobain, Kurt. ''Journals''. Riverhead Books, 2002. ISBN 1-57322-232-1</ref>

Cobain has said, "The entire song is made up of contradictory ideas [. . .] It's just making fun of the thought of having a revolution.  But it's a nice thought."<ref>Azerrad, pg. 213</ref>  Drummer Dave Grohl has stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said "Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has a lot to say about something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes."<ref>Azerrad, pg. 214</ref>

==Music video==

Like the song itself, the [[music video]] for "Smells Like Teen Spirit" has been highly popular and acclaimed. The video for the song won the band "Best New Artist" and "Best Alternative Group" awards for Nirvana at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2000 the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] named it the Most Played Video on [[MTV Europe]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2682023&page=1 | title=ABC News: Achieving Nirvana: Grunge Band's 'Teen Sprit' is Top Song of Past Two Decades | accessdate=2006-12-01 | author=ABC News | date=2006-11-27}}</ref>

The music video was the first for acclaimed director [[Samuel Bayer]], who would later go on to direct videos for such notable rock acts as [[Green Day]], [[Metallica]], and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. The concept of the video, a concert in a school that ends in [[anarchy]], was inspired by [[Jonathan Kaplan]]'s 1979 movie [[Over the Edge (film)|Over the Edge]]. Filmed on a soundstage in [[Culver City]], the video featured the band playing at a [[pep rally]] in a high school gym, surrounded by apathetic students on bleachers and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the [[Anarchist symbolism#Circle-A|Circle-A]] anarchist symbol. The video ends with the assembled students destroying the set and the band's gear.  The demolition of the set captured in video's conclusion was the result of genuine discontent. The extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated for the entire afternoon of filming, and had sat through numerous replays of the song. Cobain talked Bayer into having the extras come down to [[moshing|mosh]] and the set became a scene of chaos. "Once the kids came out dancing they just said 'fuck you,' because they were so tired of this shit throughout the day," Cobain said.<ref>Azerrad, pg.190-91</ref>

Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and personally oversaw a re-edit of the video to the version that finally saw rotation. One of his major additions was the next-to-last shot of the video, which was a close-up of his own face after it had been obscured for most of the video.<ref>Azerrad, pg. 191</ref>

The music video has been parodied at least twice: in [[Weird Al Yankovic]]'s music video for "Smells Like Nirvana" and in [[Bob Sinclar]] and [[Cutee B]]'s 2006 music video for "[[Rock This Party]]".

==Live performances==

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was first performed live on [[April 17]], [[1991]] at the [[OK Hotel]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. The performance can be found on the DVD of the 2004 boxset ''[[With the Lights Out]],'' with shorter clips included in the ''[[Nevermind]]'' [[Classic Albums]] DVD and the documentary film ''[[Hype!]]'' As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with "Come out and play, make up the rules" instead of the eventual opening of "Load up on guns, bring your friends". A recorded version of the earlier version appears on ''[[With the Lights Out]]'' and again on ''[[Sliver: The Best of the Box]]''.  A similar early live performance of the song (among others) is found in the documentary ''[[1991: The Year Punk Broke]]'', filmed during a 1991 summer tour in [[Europe]] with [[Sonic Youth]].

A memorable performance of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" occurred on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', during which frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] sang in a deliberately low, mournful tone, and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, "Load up on guns, bring your friends" became "Load up on [[drugs]], kill your friends"). He would later claim he was trying to sound like former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] frontman [[Morrissey]].<ref>Cross, pg. 208</ref> When ''Top of the Pops'' was cancelled in 2006, ''[[The Observer]]'' listed Nirvana's performance of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as the third greatest in the show's history.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title="Top of the Pops" shows | format=http | work=observer.guardian.co.uk | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/the10/story/0,,1818026,00.html | accessdate=October 18 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This performance can be found on the 1994 home video ''[[Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!]]'', and on the bootleg ''[[Outcesticide|Outcesticide IV: Rape of the Vaults]]''.

Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and [[tempo]] for live performances. Most live performances of the song had the line "our little group has always been" changed to "our little tribe has always been", which can be heard on ''[[From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]]''.

==Cover versions==

The song has been covered by numerous artists, including [[Tori Amos]] on her ''[[Crucify (song)|Crucify]]'' EP (which Cobain referred to as "a great breakfast cereal version"),<ref>Azerrad, pg. 257</ref> the jazz band [[The Bad Plus]], [[The Melvins]] and the industrial act [[Xorcist]]. The Japanese Beatboxer [[Dokaka]] also made his own beatboxed cover version for it. In 2005, it was covered as a [[swing music|swing]] song by 1950s star [[Paul Anka]]. The song was also sampled by Germany's [[Atari Teenage Riot]] in their song "Atari Teenage Riot," from their 1997 album ''[[Burn, Berlin, Burn!]]'' An instrumental cover version was produced by [[World Championship Wrestling]] as the [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] for wrestler [[Dallas Page|Diamond Dallas Page]], with clips of DDP's voice dubbed in from time to time. The song was also performed in a [[cabaret]] style in the [[2001]] movie ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]''.  In [[1995]], [[The Moog Cookbook]] released a [[The Moog Cookbook (album)|self-titled album]] with a cover of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" on track seven. A year later, an album titled ''[[Grunge Lite]]'' was released with [[Sara Debell]]'s cover as the first track.  When [[Nonex]] released their self-titled album in [[1999]], the second track was a cover of "Smells Like Teen Spirit."

A cover of the song performed by [[Blanks 77]] is available as track two of ''[[Smells Like Bleach: A Punk Tribute to Nirvana]]''.  Another cover, this one by [[Beki Bondage]], is available as track seven of the tribute album ''[[Smells Like Nirvana (album)|Smells Like Nirvana]]''.  (This is also available as track two of her ''[[Cold Turkey (album)|Cold Turkey]]'' album.)  Both of these tribute albums were released in [[2000]].  In [[2001]], a tribute album was released tilted ''[[The Cocktail Tribute to Nirvana]]'', also offering a cover of the song as track seven.  That same year, [[Josh Roseman]] provided as track twelve of his album ''[[Cherry (album)|Cherry]]'' his rendition of the song, and the [[Aqua Velvets]] released a cover as track twenty-four of their ''[[Radio Waves (album)|Radio Waves]]'' album.  Later, in [[2002]], a tribute album titled ''[[Nearvana "San Francisco"]]'' was released, offering as track twelve a cover by [[Amanita]].  The first track of ''[[String Quartet Tribute to Nirvana's Nevermind]]'', released in [[2005]], is an all-strings rendition of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as performed by [[Tallywood Strings]].  A [[2006]] release titled ''[[Rockabye Baby! Lullaby Renditions of Nirvana]]'' contains a version of the song by [[Michael Armstrong (musician)|Michael Armstrong]].

In 1992, the song was [[parody|parodied]] by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] as "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]", a song about Nirvana itself. Weird Al's parody was about how it was difficult to understand Cobain's lyrics and their meaning. The music video for the song even went as far as using the same set, costumes, and members of the cast from the original "Spirit" video. Yankovic has said Kurt Cobain told him he realized that Nirvana had "made it" when he heard the parody.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title=Weird Al Yankovic Dishes On James Blunt, Discusses His Role As the Whitest, Nerdiest Rock Star Ever  | format=http | work=rollingstone.com | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/09/19/weird-al-yankovic-dishes-on-james-blunt-discusses-his-role-as-the-whitest-nerdiest-rock-star-ever/ | accessdate=October 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In 1995, the [[queercore]] band [[Pansy Division]] recorded a parody of the song called "Smells Like Queer Spirit" for their "[[Pile Up]]" album.

In 2006, the band [[Flyleaf]] covered the song for [[Yahoo!|Yahoo's]] [[LAUNCHcast]] service.

The version of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" on the release is the single edit that was featured in the music video, which removes approximately thirty seconds from the album version. In particular, two repetitions of the main riff have been removed from the beginning of the song, as has the repeat of the first section of the guitar solo.

The UK CD Single falsely lists the length of "Even in His Youth" as [[420 (cannabis culture)|4:20]]. The US CD Single correctly lists the song length at 3:03.
