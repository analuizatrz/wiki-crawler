'''Pasir Ris Park''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 白沙公园) is a beach park located in the north-eastern part of [[Singapore]]. It stands at 71 hectares of land, including 6 hectares of preserved mangrove forests and some reclaimed land.  This coastal park is among one of the largest in Singapore. 

The full length of the park is around 6.6 kilometres. Currently, there are minor waterworks construction going on in the park near Downtown East, which could possibly see a significant change in the layout of the park.

==Attractions==

There is a 6-[[hectare]] mangrove forest within Pasir Ris Park. Boardwalks are built into the mangrove forests to enable visitors to explore the natural surroundings easily. [[Mud crab]]s, [[mudskipper]]s and mangrove trees such as Rhizophora and Bruguiera are found in this park.

There is a 3-storey high [[Bird]] Watching Tower in the park, where birdwatchers will be able to see birds perching on tree branches.

Also in this park, there is a beach. There are also many other facilities like a [[cycling]] track, [[barbecue]] pits and dining. Some resorts located near the park have gates linking to the park [http://www.aloha.gov.sg/sections/loyang/frm_mf_loyang_location.htm#].

One of the most popular features of Pasir Ris Park is the huge [[playground]] located on the western end. This playground is popular with both [[children]] and [[teenagers]]. It has features such as play stations, slides, and 'space-nets' for the kids, as well as rope climbing, cableways, and [[basketball]] courts for the older ones.
