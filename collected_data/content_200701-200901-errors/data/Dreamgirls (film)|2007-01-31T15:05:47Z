'''''Dreamgirls'''''  is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[United States|American]] [[musical film]] jointly produced and released by [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was released in three special [[road show]] engagements beginning [[December 15]], [[2006]], with a nationwide expansion on [[December 25]], [[2006]] and a wide release on [[January 12]], [[2007]]. The films [[Australia|Australian]] release was on [[January 18]], [[2007]] and the [[United Kingdom]] release will be on [[February 2]], [[2007]]. ''Dreamgirls'' won three awards at the [[64th Golden Globe Awards]] ceremony in 2007, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Picture - Musical or Comedy]], and has received eight nominations, but not [[ Best Picture]], for the upcoming [[79th Academy Awards]].

A musical set in the 1960s and 1970s with a predominantly [[African-American]] cast, ''Dreamgirls'' is adapted from the [[1981]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[Dreamgirls|of the same name]], which itself is loosely based upon both the history of [[Motown Records|Motown]] act [[The Supremes]] and the evolution of American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music over the years. The film follows the lives of three women — Effie White, Deena Jones, and Lorrell Robinson — who, as members of an R&B singing group called "The Dreamettes", become famous as the backing group for soul singer James "Thunder" Early, thanks to manipulative manager and record label executive Curtis Taylor, Jr. Conflict arises when Curtis desires to transform the Dreamettes into "The Dreams", a [[pop music|pop]]-friendly act, particularly when he has Deena replace the heavier Effie as both lead singer of the group and as his romantic interest.

The film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'', which had been in development at various times during the 1980s and 1990s, stars [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Beyoncé Knowles]], and [[Eddie Murphy]], also featuring [[Danny Glover]], [[Anika Noni Rose]], [[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]], [[Sharon Leal]], [[Hinton Battle]] and in her film debut, [[Jennifer Hudson]] (of ''[[American Idol]]'' fame). Produced by [[Laurence Mark]], ''Dreamgirls'' was written and directed for the screen by [[Bill Condon]], screenwriter of the [[Academy Award]]-winning film adaptation of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', working from the original Broadway book by [[Tom Eyen]] and the Broadway songs by Eyen and [[Henry Krieger]].

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
As in the original stage musical, the plot of ''Dreamgirls'' can be broken up into two acts: the first taking place in the 1960s, and the second taking place in the 1970s.

[[Image:Dreamgirls-film-01.jpg|300px|thumb|left|(left to right) C.C. ([[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]]), Lorrell ([[Anika Noni Rose]]), Deena ([[Beyoncé Knowles]]), and Effie ([[Jennifer Hudson]]) in a backstage scene from ''Dreamgirls''.]]
===Act I===
The film begins in [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 1962, as an amateur African-American girl group known as The Dreamettes enter a talent competition at the Detroit Theater. Backstage, the three girls — full-figured lead singer Effie White ([[Jennifer Hudson]]), Deena Jones ([[Beyoncé Knowles]]) and Lorrell Robinson ([[Anika Noni Rose]]) — meet Curtis Taylor, Jr. ([[Jamie Foxx]]), an ambitious [[Cadillac]] dealer with plans of breaking into the music business. Placing himself as their manager, Curtis arranges for the Dreamettes to tour as backup for a regional R&B star, James "Thunder" Early ([[Eddie Murphy]]), by striking a deal with Jimmy's manager Marty ([[Danny Glover]]). The tour takes Jimmy and the girls across the country on the [[chitlin' circuit]].

Hoping to help Jimmy and the girls cross over to mainstream audiences, Curtis starts his own record label, Rainbow Records (''"The Sound of Tomorrow"''), out of his car dealership's office, and makes Effie's brother C.C. ([[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]]) his head songwriter. However, when Rainbow's first single fails after a white pop group releases a cover version, Curtis, his sidekick Wayne ([[Hinton Battle]]), and C.C. turn to [[payola]]. By paying the right people, Curtis manages to get Jimmy and the Dreamettes to the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and into a headlining gig at the [[Apollo Theater]]. Offstage, Effie is quickly becoming infatuated with the slick-talking Curtis, and Jimmy - a married man - begins an adulterous affair with Lorrell, who becomes equally as lovesick as Effie.

Marty grows weary of Curtis' plans to make Jimmy's image and sound more pop-friendly, to the point that he walks out on Jimmy. However, when Curtis finds that he cannot completely remake Jimmy into a pop act, he shifts his attention back to the Dreamettes. Feeling that Effie's voice is too "special" and her figure too large to attract white audiences, Curtis appoints the slimmer Deena as the lead singer of the Dreamettes.

With the aid of new songs and a new more glamorous image, Curtis and C.C. transform The Dreamettes into ''The Dreams'', a top selling pop act whose popularity rivals that of [[The Beatles]]. However, the betrayed Effie does not take kindly to being reduced to Deena's backup, and begins acting out, becoming even more unruly when Curtis's affections also turn towards Deena. When Effie, feeling ill, does not turn up to rehearse for the Dreams' [[Las Vegas]] debut, Curtis replaces Effie with his secretary, Michelle Morris ([[Sharon Leal]]). Effie, who has just learned she is pregnant, arrives at the [[Caesar's Palace]] venue to discover Michelle has replaced her, and after a nearly violent argument, finds herself without her group, without her brother, and without Curtis.

===Act II===
The film jumps ahead to 1973. Effie is broke (having fallen into [[alcoholism]] after being fired from the Dreams), and is raising her eight-year-old daughter Magic ([[Mariah I. Wilson]]) alone on welfare in the burnt-out inner city of Detroit. On the other hand, Rainbow Records has moved to [[Los Angeles]], where it prospers with Deena Jones & the Dreams - as the group is now known - and many other pop acts. Curtis and Deena are now married, and, wanting to expand the Rainbow empire into film, Curtis plans to have the unwilling Deena star in a [[blaxploitation]] musical version of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''. Hoping that the struggling film project will never get off the ground, Deena begins secretly meeting with other studios to take a part in another film.

Though still part of the Rainbow roster, Jimmy Early's star has long faded, and Curtis has little interest in revitalizing his career. Unsatisfied with both his wife Melba ([[Dawnn Lewis]]) and his long-term mistress Lorrell, Jimmy turns to drugs for affection. C.C., although in an ironic relationship with Michelle, continues to reach out to Effie, who stubbornly ignores the letters and money he sends. Eventually, Effie swallows her pride and, with Marty as her manager, returns to singing and secures gigs at a small Detroit club.

In 1974, Rainbow Records hosts a tenth anniversary TV special featuring its roster of stars. Midway through his performance of a pop-friendly love song, Jimmy breaks out into a wild [[James Brown]]-esque [[funk]] number and drops his pants on live TV. Curtis resultantly terminates Jimmy's contract, and Lorrell, weary of their eight-year affair, leaves Jimmy behind as well. Some time later, Jimmy dies of a drug overdose caused by [[heroin]].

Angry over Jimmy's death and frustrated with Curtis' attempts to "drain the soul" out of his music to create a "new sound" ([[disco]]), C.C. walks out on Rainbow Records, going back to Detroit to find Effie. The two siblings reconcile at a [[wake (ceremony)|wake]] for Jimmy and work together to produce Effie's comeback single, "One Night Only". Just as the record begins gaining radio play, however, Curtis strikes: using payola, he forces radio DJs to play a disco cover of "One Night Only" by Deena Jones & the Dreams instead of Effie's original.

Curtis has also learned of Deena's covert meetings with other film producers, and asserts his control over his wife. Rebuffed, Deena sneaks into Curtis' office and unwittingly discovers information about Curtis' payola schemes and how he stopped Effie's record. She calls Effie and C.C., who arrive at the Rainbow offices with Marty and a lawyer. As Deena and Effie reconcile, Curtis works out a deal with the lawyer to avoid being reported to the [[FBI]] for payola: Rainbow Records will fund a new label for C.C., which will allow Effie's record national distribution. Curtis confronts Deena, only to find that Effie's victory has inspired Deena to leave Curtis and make it on her own.

As a result, Deena Jones & the Dreams give a farewell performance at the Detroit Theater. At the conclusion of the concert, Effie joins Deena, Lorrell, and Michelle onstage, and the reunited Dreams give one final performance of their signature song, "Dreamgirls". Fittingly, it is Effie who sings lead, while the other three ladies sing back-up. As the concert ends, Curtis takes notice of Magic in the front row, and realizes that he is the girl's father.

==Production history==
[[Image:Dreamgirls-film-02.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Eddie Murphy]] as R&B star James "Thunder" Early.]]
===Pre-production===
Since the 1980s, several different attempts have been made to produce a film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'', a Broadway musical loosely based upon the story of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]] which won six [[Tony Awards]] in 1982. [[David Geffen]], the stage musical's co-financier, retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'', although he turned down many offers to adapt the story for the screen, feeling a need to preserve the integrity of ''Dreamgirls'' stage director [[Michael Bennett]]'s work after his 1987 death.<ref>Marr, Melissa (Dec 8, 2006). "After 'Dreamgirls', Geffen says goodbye to movies". ''The Wall-Street Journal''. Retrieved from http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06342/744656-254.stm on December 9, 2006 </ref>. Geffen, who ran his [[Warner Bros]]-associated [[Geffen Pictures]] film production company at the time, began talks with Broadway lyricist and producer [[Howard Ashman]] to adapt it as a star vehicle for [[Whitney Houston]], who was to portray Deena. The production ran into problems when Houston wanted to sing both Deena's and Effie's songs (particularly "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"), and the film was eventually abandoned. <ref>Hill, Jeremy. "Film Version (2006): History". ''Dreamgirls: Your Virtual Coffee Table Book of the Musical''. Retrieved from http://www.graiai.com/dreamgirls/ on November 10, 2006.</ref>

When David Geffen co-founded DreamWorks SKG in 1994 and dissolved Geffen Pictures, the rights to ''Dreamgirls'' remained with Warner Bros. Warner planned to go ahead with the film, to have been directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], in the late 1990s following the success of the [[Tina Turner]] biopic ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'' (1993).  This version was planned to have starred [[Lauryn Hill]] as Deena and [[Kelly Price]] as Effie. After Warner's [[Frankie Lymon]] biopic ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' failed at the box office, the studio shut down development on ''Dreamgirls''. <ref>Hill, Jeremy. "Film Version (2006): History". ''Dreamgirls: Your Virtual Coffee Table Book of the Musical''. Retrieved from http://www.graiai.com/dreamgirls/ on November 10, 2006.</ref>

DreamWorks' ''Dreamgirls'' adaptation came about after the film version of the Broadway musical ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' was a success at both the box office and the [[Academy Awards]]. Screenwriter and director [[Bill Condon]], who wrote the screenplay for ''Chicago'', met producer [[Laurence Mark]] at a Hollywood party in 2002, where the two discussed a long held "dream project" of Condon's - adapting ''Dreamgirls'' for the screen.  They were able to convince David Geffen to lease them the rights to the musical by presenting Condon's concept of telling the ''Dreamgirls'' story in a larger context, incorporating the significant changes and events that took place in the United States during the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] which occurs at the time of the story.<ref>Ulmer, James (Spet. 10, 2006).

===Stage to script changes===
[[Image:Dreamgirls-film-03.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jaime Foxx]] as budding music-industry mogul Curtis Taylor, Jr.]]
While much of the stage musical's story remains intact, a number of significant changes were made. The Dreams' hometown - the setting for much of the action - was moved from [[Chicago]] to Detroit (the real-life hometown of The Supremes and Motown Records). The roles of many of the characters are fleshed out and further developed giving them more substance and relating them more closely to their real-life inspirations, following a suggestion by Geffen.<ref>Marr, Melissa (Dec 8, 2006). "After 'Dreamgirls', Geffen says goodbye to movies". ''The Wall-Street Journal''. Retrieved from http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06342/744656-254.stm on December 9, 2006 </ref> For example, Curtis Taylor's music empire expands beyond Deena Jones & the Dreams, to more closely resemble that of [[Berry Gordy]]'s Motown, and C.C. White, as the head of songwriting and production at Rainbow Records, is more clearly a [[Smokey Robinson]] analogue than he was in the original play. Also, the story's first locale is not the [[Apollo Theater]], as in the stage musical, but a local talent show in Detroit, as the film version of Jimmy Early builds up to the level of star power he already has in the play.

Warner Bros., who still retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'', agreed to co-produce the film with DreamWorks. However, after casting was completed, the film was budgeted at $73 million.  Worried about the budget, Warner backed out of the production, and Geffen, taking the role of co-producer, instead had Paramount Pictures co-finance and release ''Dreamgirls''. During the course of production, Paramount's parent company, [[Viacom]], would purchase DreamWorks, aligning the two studios under one umbrella. <ref>Marr, Melissa (Dec 8, 2006).

===Casting notes===
[[Jamie Foxx]] was the first actor approached to play Curtis Taylor, Jr. However, the actor turned the part down because DreamWorks could not meet his salary demands. [[Denzel Washington]], [[Will Smith]], and [[Terrence Howard]] were among the actors approached after Foxx turned down the part of Curtis. <ref> Johnson, Pamela K. (Aug 2005). "Howard's Homecoming".

Comedian [[Eddie Murphy]], who had a brief musical career in the 1980s, was approached to play James "Thunder" Early and accepted. Upon learning that Knowles and Murphy had signed on, Foxx rethought his original decision and accepted the role at a lower salary than he originally requested.<ref>Daly, Steve (November 10, 2006).

The most crucial casting decision involved the role of Effie White, the emotional center of the story. It was decided that a relative unknown would be cast, paralleling the casting of then-21-year-old [[Jennifer Holliday]] in that role for the original Broadway production. Seven hundred eighty-three singing actresses auditioned for the role of Effie White, with two of the top contenders being ''[[American Idol]]'' alumnae [[Fantasia Barrino]] and [[Jennifer Hudson]]. Although Barrino had won the title of "American Idol" during the year she and Hudson were on the show, David Geffen rejected the idea of having Barrino play the part, and Hudson was cast as Effie.<ref>(Dec. 5 2005).

[[Loretta Devine]], who played Lorrell in the original Broadway play, has a cameo in the film as a jazz singer who performs the song "I Miss You, Old Friend" in Jimmy's wake scene. Another ''Dreamgirls'' veteran present in the film is [[Hinton Battle]], who was a summer replacement for James "Thunder" Early onstage and here portrays Curtis' aide-de-camp Wayne.

===Production notes===
After Hudson was cast in November 2005, the ''Dreamgirls'' cast began rehearsals with Condon, choreographer [[Fatima Robinson]], composer Henry Krieger, and others. Hudson was made to gain twenty pounds, as it was felt she was not quite heavy enough to play Effie.<ref>Joyner, Tom, Wilkes, Sybil, and Brown, J. Anthony (Dec. 12, 2006).

Beyoncé Knowles elected to lose weight to give the mature Deena Jones of the 1970s a different look than the younger version of the character. By sticking to a highly publicized diet of water and cayenne pepper, Knowles rapidly lost twenty pounds, which she gained back once production ended. <ref>(May 22, 2006).

===Music===
[[Image:Beyoncelisten.jpg|thumb|right|The cover to "[[Listen (song)|Listen]]", the first single from the ''Dreamgirls'' soundtrack.]]

Much of the dialogue in the ''Dreamgirls'' stage musical is delivered as [[recitative]]: it is sung rather than spoken. For the film version, Condon replaced much of the recitative with spoken lines. Among the major omissions from the musical's score are C.C. and Effie's "Effie, Sing My Song" (which was shot for the film but replaced with an alternative spoken version), Lorrell's "Ain't No Party", both instances of "Press Conference", the "Party, Party" sequence, and the musical's choral refrain of "showbiz...it's just showbiz".

Four new songs were added for the film, all featuring music composed by original ''Dreamgirls'' stage composer [[Henry Krieger]]: "Love You I Do" (lyrics by [[Siedah Garrett]]), "Patience" (lyrics by [[Willie Reale]]), "Perfect World" (lyrics by Siedah Garrett), and "[[Listen (song)|Listen]]" (additional music by [[Scott Cutler]] and lyrics by [[Anne Preven]] and [[Beyoncé Knowles]]). All of the songs in the film were arranged and produced by R&B/pop production team [[The Underdogs]] (Harvey Mason, Jr. and Damon Thomas), with music video veteran [[Fatima Robinson]] serving as choreographer. <ref> Bloom, Julie (Nov. 27, 2006).

The ''[[Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture]]'' [[soundtrack album]] was released on [[December 5]] by Music World Entertainment/[[Columbia Records]], in both a single-disc version containing highlights and a double-disc "Deluxe Version" containing all of the film's songs. The single-disc version of the soundtrack peaked at number-one on the [[Billboard 200]] during a slow sales week in early January 2007. "Listen" was the first official single from the soundtrack; "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" will be the second. <ref>(Jan. 9, 2007).

===Related promotions and products===
To give the story more exposure for the upcoming film release, DreamWorks Pictures and the licensee of the original play, The Tams-Witmark Music Library, announced that they would pay the licensing fees for all non-professional stage performances of ''Dreamgirls'' for the calendar year of 2006. DreamWorks hoped to encourage amateur productions of ''Dreamgirls'', and familiarize a wider audience with the play. As a result, more than fifty high schools, colleges, community theaters, and other non-commercial theater entities staged productions of ''Dreamgirls'' in 2006, and DreamWorks spent up to $250,000 subsidizing the licensing. <ref> Olsen, Mark (Dec. 12, 2006).

The ''Dreamgirls'' [[novelization]] was written by African-American novelist [[Denene Millner]], and adapts the film's official script in chapter form, along with fourteen pages of photographs from the film. The book was released on [[October 31]], [[2006]]. A [[scrapbook]], entitled ''Dreamgirls: The Movie Musical'', is set for release on [[January 29]], [[2007]]. The limited edition program guide accompanying the ''Dreamgirls'' road show release will be available for retail purchase in February. In addition, the Tonnor Doll Company released "The Dreamettes" collection, featuring dolls of the characters Deena, Lorrell, and Effie, to coincide with the release of the film.

==Allusions to factual events==
Aside from the overall plot of the film and elements already present in the stage musical, many direct references to Motown or R&B/soul history in general are included in the film. Among the most prominent are the following:
<!--Discuss any further additions to this list on the talk page. And please have references ready -->
*The album covers used for many of the Dreams' albums in the film are directly adapted from designs used for actual Supremes album covers. The cover for the ''Meet the Dreams'' album is a combination of the designs from the Supremes albums ''[[More Hits by the Supremes]]'' and ''[[The Supremes A' Go-Go]]''. In addition, the covers for the Supremes albums ''[[Touch (Supremes album)|Touch]]'', ''[[Cream of the Crop]]'', and ''[[Let the Sunshine In (Supremes album)|Let the Sunshine In]]'' were reworked to include Beyoncé Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, Sharon Leal, and the "Deena Jones & the Dreams" name, with all other design elements remaining the same.
*The Dreams are briefly seen arriving in [[London]], wearing the same outfits The Supremes wore on the cover of their 1964 album ''[[A Bit of Liverpool]]''. A promotional film screened by Deena later in the film shows scenes from a Dreams TV performance, the costuming and set design of which alludes to The Supremes' [[September 29]], [[1968]] performance of "[[Love Child (song)|Love Child]]" on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.
*The design for Deena Jones' solo LP ''Just in Time'' was based upon the design for the 1970 [[Dionne Warwick]] album ''[[Very Dionne]]''.
*The Dreams are from the same [[public housing]] project, the [[Brewster-Douglas]] Projects, as The Supremes. The actual Brewster Projects complex is briefly seen in the film when Jimmy's tour bus pulls up to take the girls on Jimmy's ten-week tour. <ref> Lawson, Terry (Dec. 22, 2006).

{{spoiler}}
*Curtis has The Dreams in the studio recording the song "Heavy", despite the occurrence of a [[race riot]] just outside in the streets. This is a reference to the [[12th Street Riot]] in Detroit in July 1967, during which Motown Records - while having planned to close - remained open and active. <ref> Posner, Gerald (2002). ''Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power.'' New York: Random House. ISBN 0-375-50062-6. Pg. 173.</ref>
*The locale of the Dreams' Las Vegas debut, their first appearance as ''Deena Jones & the Dreams'', and Effie's expulsion from the group is the [[Caesar's Palace]] hotel in Las Vegas. In real life, the setting for The Supremes' Las Vegas debut, their first appearance as ''[[Diana Ross]] & the Supremes'', and [[Florence Ballard]]'s expulsion from the group was the [[Flamingo Hotel]], which is across the street from Caesar's Palace and is briefly seen in an insert shot. <ref>[[Nelson George|George, Nelson]] (1985). ''Where Did Our Love Go?: The Rise and Fall of the Motown Sound.'' New York: St. Martin's Press. ISBN 978-0312011093. Pgs. 163-164.</ref>
*Curtis objects to the release of Jimmy's message song "Patience", for the same reason Berry Gordy objected to the release of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s ''[[What's Going On]]'' LP - both doubted the commercial viability of such recordings. <ref>Posner, Gerald (2002). ''Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power.'' Pgs. 252-254.</ref> However, while Gordy eventually relented, Curtis does not.
*Many of the details of Curtis' payola operation, revealed at the end of the film by C.C. and Marty's lawyer, are identical to those of the payola schemes used by Gordy and the other Motown executives. <ref>Posner, Gerald (2002). ''Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power.'' Pgs. 216-222.</ref> Several references are also made to [[Mafia]]-backed loans Curtis uses to fund Rainbow Records. Berry Gordy was highly suspected, though never proven, to have used Mafia-backed loans to finance Motown <ref>Posner, Gerald (2002). ''Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power.'' Pgs. 199-203.</ref>

==Trivia==
*The instrumental piece played by the "Blue Bleu" jazz club house band while Curtis, Jimmy, and Marty discuss trying a new sound for Jimmy is actually the first section of the stage version of "Cadillac Car". In the stage musical, Curtis convinces Jimmy to "get a smoother sound" through song instead of dialogue.
*At five feet and two inches, Anika Noni Rose is at least four inches shorter than most of her co-stars. Therefore, the actress was required to wear (and dance in) four and five-inch heels for much of the picture, which Rose later stated caused her discomfort.<ref>Daly, Steve (November 10, 2006). "Chasing Down the 'Dreamgirls'". ''Entertainment Weekly''. Retrieved from http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1557593_1_0_,00.html on November 11, 2006.</ref>
*This is not Anika Noni Rose's first screen appearance with an ''American Idol'' contestant; she was also in the unsuccessful ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]'' with [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Justin Guarini]].
*This is the first film from Paramount Pictures to star Eddie Murphy (who once signed an exclusive contract with the studio) since ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'' in 1995. Also, as a result of [[Viacom]]'s acquisition of DreamWorks, Paramount will distribute two more Eddie Murphy films for DreamWorks in 2007: ''[[Norbit]]'' and ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', since Paramount now has the rights to distribute films by DreamWorks.
