'''Kalimpong''' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: कालिम्पोङ) is a [[hill station]] (a hill town) nestled in the [[Siwalik Hills|Shiwalik Hills]] (or Lower Himalaya) in the [[India]]n [[states and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is located at {{coor d|27.06|N|88.47|E|}} at an average [[elevation]] of 1,247&nbsp;[[metre|m]] (4,100&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]). The town is the headquarters of the Kalimpong subdivision, a part of the [[Darjeeling District|district of Darjeeling]]. A major [[Military base|forward base]] of the [[Indian Army]] is located on the outskirts of the town.

Kalimpong had an orginal name as ka-ley-bong. When the British were in India they could not pronounce the word, so they called it kalimpong. Kalimpong is well known for its many educational institutions, which attract students from all over [[North-East India|North East India]], [[West Bengal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bangladesh]]. Some of these famous good education institutes are Dr. Graham's homes (co-ed, existing for more than 100 years, 500 acres of land), St. Augustine School(only for boys), St. Joseph Convent( for girls only), Rockvale Academy(co-ed).  In recent times, Kalimpong has become an important tourist destination owing to its [[Temperate|temperate climate]] and proximity to popular tourist locations in the region. Kalimpong is also famous for its [[flower]] market, especially the wide array of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]]. It also houses several [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Monastery|monasteries]] which hold a number of rare [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] scriptures.

==Name origin==
[[image:Kalimpongtown.jpg|thumb|Kalimpong town as viewed from a distant hill. In the background are the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] Mountains.]]
The precise [[etymology]] of the name ''Kalimpong'' remains unclear. The most widely accepted origin of the name ''Kalimpong'' is "Assembly (or Stockade) of the King's Ministers" in [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]], derived from ''kalon'' ("King's ministers") and ''pong'' ("[[stockade]]").<ref name=etymosikkim>{{cite web

}}</ref> Another possible origin to the name comes from the translation "ridges where we play" from [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]], derived from the region's traditional tribal gathering for summer sporting events.<ref name=etymosikkim/> People from the hills also call the area ''Kalibong'' ("the black spurs").<ref name=etymosikkim/> 

According to K.P. Tamsang, author of ''The Untold and Unknown Reality about the Lepchas'', the term Kalimpong is deduced from the name ''Kalenpung'', which in Lepcha means "Hillock of Assemblage";<ref name=kalidarjhist>{{cite web

}}</ref> in time, the name was distorted to ''Kaleebung'' and later corrupted to Kalimpong. Another possible derivation points to [[Kaulim]], a fibrous plant found in profusion in the region.<ref name=etymosikkim/>

==History==
[[Image:morganhouse.jpg|thumb|Morgan House, is a classic example of colonial architecture in Kalimpong.]]
Until the mid-19th century, the area around Kalimpong was ruled intermittently by the [[Sikkim]]ese and [[Bhutan]]ese kingdoms. Present-day Kalimpong is believed to have once been the forward position of the Bhutanese in the 18th century, overlooking the Teesta Valley. The area was sparsely populated by the indigenous [[Lepcha]] community and migrant [[Bhutia]] and [[Limbu]] tribes. After the [[Anglo-Bhutan War]] in 1864, the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] (1865) was signed in which Bhutanese held territory east of the [[Teesta River]] was ceded to the [[British East India Company]]. At that time, Kalimpong was a hamlet, with only two or three families known to reside there.<ref name=tribunekalim>{{cite web

}}</ref> The first recorded mention of the town was a fleeting reference made that year by [[Ashley Eden]], a government official with the Bengal Civil Service.

After the war, the region was made into a subdivision of the [[Western Duars]] district, and the following year it was merged with the district of Darjeeling.<ref name=kalidarjhist/> The temperate climate prompted the British to develop the town as an alternative hill station to [[Darjeeling]], to escape the scorching summer heat in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain|plains]]. Kalimpong's proximity to the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla]] passes, offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]], was an added advantage and it soon became an important trading outpost in the trade of [[fur]]s, [[wool]]s and food grains between India and Tibet. The increase in population attracted large numbers of migrants from Nepal, leading to a sudden population increase and economic prosperity.

The arrival of [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] saw the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British. Rev. W. Macfarlane in the early 1870s established the first schools in the area.<ref name=tribunekalim/> The Scottish University Mission Institution was opened in 1886, followed by the Kalimpong Girls High School. In 1900, Reverend J.A. Graham founded the [[Dr. Graham's Homes]] for destitute [[Anglo-Indian]] students. By 1907, most schools in Kalimpong also started offering education to Indian students. By 1911, the population had swelled to 7,880.

Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Kalimpong became part of the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and [[Pakistan]]. With [[People's Republic of China|China's]] annexation of Tibet in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled [[Tibet]] and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks also brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelepla Pass after the [[Sino-Indian War]] led to a slowdown in Kalimpong's economy, which relied heavily in trade between Tibet and India. In 1976, the visiting [[Dalai Lama]] consecrated the [[Zang Dhok Palri Phodang]] monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.

[[Image:Kalimpongkanchenjanga.jpg|thumb|Most large houses in Kalimpong were built during the British era. In the background is Mount Kanchenjunga.]]
Between 1986 and 1988, the demand for a separate state of [[Gorkhaland]] and [[Kamtapur]] based on ethnic lines grew strong. Riots between the [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF), led by [[C K Pradhan]], and the West Bengal government reached a standoff after a forty-day strike. The town was virtually under a siege, leading the state government to call in the Indian army to maintain law and order. This led to the formation of the [[Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council]], a body that was given semi-autonomous powers to govern the district. Though Kalimpong is now peaceful, the issue of a separate state still lingers. In July 2004, the generally tranquil town was catapulted into national and international headlines after [[Maninder Pal Singh Kohli]], a murderer wanted by [[Scotland Yard]], was traced and found to be residing in Kalimpong.<ref>''[http://www.suntimes.co.za/2004/07/25/news/durban/ndbn13.asp Wife duped by murder fugitive]'', Peter Foster, [http://www.suntimes.co.za Sunday Times (South Africa)], Sunday, [[2004-07-25]].</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Deolo.jpg|thumb|A view from the Deolo Resort, atop Deolo Hill, Kalimpong's highest point.]]
The town centre is located on a [[ridge]] connecting two hills, [[Deolo Hill]] and [[Durpin Hill]], at an elevation of 1,247&nbsp;m (4,091&nbsp;feet). Deolo, the highest point in Kalimpong, has an altitude of 1,704&nbsp;m (5,590&nbsp;feet) and Durpin Hill is at an elevation of 1,372&nbsp;m (4,501&nbsp;feet). The [[River Teesta]] flows in the valley below and separates Kalimpong from the state of Sikkim. The [[Siwalik Hills|Shiwalik Hills]], like most of the Himalayan foothills, have steep slopes and soft, loose topsoil, leading to frequent [[landslide]]s in the [[monsoon]] season. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town in the distance. Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] at 8,591&nbsp;m (28,185&nbsp;feet) the world's third tallest peak, is clearly visible from Kalimpong.
[[image:Kalimpong 02.jpg|thumb|View of the Himalaya range.]]
Kalimpong has five distinct seasons: [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], [[winter]] and the [[monsoon]]s. Summers are mild, with the highs usually never crossing 30&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (86&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]), and last between May and June. Summers are followed by the monsoon rains which lash the town between June and September. The monsoons are severe, often causing landslides which sequester the town from the rest of India. Winter lasts from December to February, with the maximum temperature being around 15&nbsp;°C (59&nbsp;°F). During the monsoon and winter seasons, Kalimpong is often enveloped by [[fog]]. The annual temperature ranges from a high of 30&nbsp;°C to a low of −4&nbsp;°C (25&nbsp;°F).

Many locales in Kalimpong are named based on its distance in miles from [[Teesta Bazaar]], a town which lies on the Teesta River in the valley below. For example, the locale ''13th mile'' would be situated at a distance of 13&nbsp;[[mile]]s (21&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) from Teesta Bazaar.

==Economy==
[[image:Kalimpong 52.jpg|thumb|Oranges grown in the hillsides are exported to many parts of India.]]

The most significant contributor to the Kalimpong economy is tourism. The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of Kalimpong's residents employed directly and indirectly.

Farming on [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced slopes]] is a major source of livelihood for its rural populace and it supplies the town with fruits and vegetables. Education used to be the primary driver of the economy of the town but in recent years its contributions to the economy have stagnated.

Many establishments cater to the Indian army base near the town, providing it with essential supplies. Small contributions to the economy come by the way of the sale of traditional arts and crafts of [[Sikkim]] and [[Tibet]]. Government efforts related to [[sericulture]], [[seismology]], [[fisheries]] etc. provide a steady source of employment to many of its residents. Kalimpong is well known for its flower export industry<ref>[http://www.hillstationsinindia.com/east-india-hill-stations/kalimponq.html Kalimpong], [http://www.hillstationsinindia.com Hill stations in India]</ref> &ndash; especially for its wide array of indigenous [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[gladioli]]. The [[Indian government]]'s proposal<ref>[http://www.flonnet.com/fl2014/stories/20030718005201800.htm Routes of promise], [http://www.flonnet.com Frontline magazine], Volume 20, Issue 14; [[July 5]]-[[July 18]], 2004.</ref> to reopen the Nathula and Jelepla passes in April 2006 will significantly boost the economy, as Kalimpong lies on historic trade routes.

==Transport==
[[image:teestavalley.jpg|thumb|National Highway 31A winds along the banks of the river Teesta near Kalimpong.]]
Most people live fairly close to the market and so they walk between their homes and the market. Those staying far from the town centre own vehicles or rely on local share-taxis to travel to their destinations. Taxis for exclusive use around the city are also available. [[Four wheel drive]]s are the most popular means of transport, as they can easily navigate the steep slopes in the region.

The nearest [[airport]] is [[Bagdogra Airport]] near [[Siliguri]] located at a distance of 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;[[mile]]s), while the nearest railhead connecting the rest of India is [[New Jalpaiguri]], located on the outskirts of Siliguri. Kalimpong is located off the National Highway 31-A, which links Siliguri to Gangtok.

The town is divided into twenty-three municipal wards by the local municipality, while the rural area is composed of forty-seven [[gram panchayat]]s. There are three blocks in Kalimpong.

Kalimpong's municipality is in charge of the infrastructure of the town such as [[potable water]] and roads. Two lakes atop Deolo Hill provide potable water to the town. Owing to severe rains that wash away most of the surface, the condition of the roads is poor. The state electricity board provides electricity to Kalimpong and although the town doesn't face power shortfalls, the [[electrical]] supply is unstable, so [[voltage stabiliser]]s are necessary. Street lighting is available only in the main town centre. The Public Works Department is responsible for the road connecting the town to the [[Expressways of India|National Highway]]&ndash;NH-31A. 

A district magistrate presides over the Kalimpong division. Kalimpong has a small police department with a lock-up. Most criminals are taken to the Darjeeling, the district headquarters for trial.
