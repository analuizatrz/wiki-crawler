'''''Californication''''' is the seventh studio album by [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released on [[June 8]], [[1999]] on [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Produced by [[Rick Rubin]], ''Californication'' marked the return of [[John Frusciante]], who had previously appeared on ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' and ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', to replace [[Dave Navarro]] as the band's guitarist. With his return, Frusciante was credited with changing the band's style altogether, resulting in a radically different recording than what was produced with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, but introduced themes of lust, death, contemplations of suicide, and drugs.

''Californication'' produced several hits for the band, including "[[Around the World (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Around the World]]", "[[Otherside]]", "[[Californication (song)|Californication]]" and the [[Grammy]]-award winning "[[Scar Tissue]]". ''Californication'' peaked at #3 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200]]. It is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful album to date, selling more than fifteen million copies worldwide;<ref name="bbc">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3864401.stm|title=Chili Peppers' album tops survey|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref> a commercial revitalization in comparison to their previous album, ''One Hot Minute''. The record marked a change in style for the band; ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Greg Tate noted that "while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, ''Californication'' dares to be spiritual and epiphanal."<ref name="rsreview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/277669/californication|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Rolling Stone'' magazine|author=Tate, Greg}}</ref>

==Background==
Guitarist [[John Frusciante]] departed from the band mid-tour in 1992, due to his heroin addiction that increasingly worsened, attributed in part to their critically acclaimed album ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]''.<ref> Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 295</ref> It took over a year before the band found a new guitarist to officially begin recording with. [[Dave Navarro]], formerly of [[Jane's Addiction]], was invited to join the Chili Peppers after Arik Marshall, who had finished the remaining tour dates for ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', was fired.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 307</ref> Navarro influenced the band's ensuing album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', by incorporating various elements of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[psychedelic rock]],<ref name=AMGOHM>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fpfwxq9hldfe|title=''One Hot Minute'' review|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> which was something that the Chili Peppers had not previously been notable for. ''One Hot Minute'' was a commercial success, selling roughly five million copies (although a let down compared to ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'').<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 344, 358, 401</ref> Critics, however, dismissed the album, claiming it was weak and unfocused.<ref name=AMGOHM/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/biography|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Biography|accessdate=2007-06-25|publisher=''Rolling Stone Magazine''}}</ref> Shortly after the release of ''One Hot Minute'', Navarro was fired due to internal differences.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 361–377</ref>

In the years following Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers, he had developed a heroin addiction that left him in poverty and near death.<ref name="redux">{{cite web| author=Skanse, Richard| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5923940/red_hot_redux | title = Red Hot Redux | publisher = RollingStone.com | date = [[1998-04-30]]| accessdate = 2007-03-31}}</ref> He was talked into admitting himself to drug rehabilitation in January 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=JOHN|FRUSCIANTE&sql=11:7veyxdkbjoly~T1|title=Biography of John Frusciante|accesssdate=2007-06-25|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> In April 1998, following Frusciante's three month completion, Flea visited his former band-mate and openly invited him to re-join the band, an invitation an emotional Frusciante readily accepted. Within the week, and for the first time in six years, the foursome gathered to play, and jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 389–400</ref>

==Writing and composition==
[[Image:Rhcpcalifornication1.jpg|150px|left|thumb|The Red Hot Chili Peppers' reunited lineup, which once again featured John Frusciante.]]
A substantial amount of the album's formation took place in the band member's homes in the summer of 1998. Kiedis and Frusciante often spent days together discussing song creation, guitar riffs and lyrical content. Bass and percussion aspects of the record were constructed through jam sessions and the individual work of Flea and Smith.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 401–406</ref>

''Californication's'' lyrics were derived from Anthony Kiedis' ideas, outlooks, and perceptions of life and its meaning. "Porcelain" resulted after Kiedis met a young mother at the [[YMCA]], who was attempting to battle her alcohol addiction whilst living with her infant daughter.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 404</ref> Sarcasm had also been lingering in his mind for quite some time and he decided to devote an entire song to the concept. Kiedis found inspiration from former band mate [[Dave Navarro]], who he considered the "King of Sarcasm".<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 409</ref> Frusciante began playing a poignant guitar riff, which Kiedis immediately saw integrating smoothly into "Scar Tissue". Running outside with joy, he saw birds flying gracefully overhead which inspired the lyric, "With the birds I'll share this lonely view".<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 408</ref>

While most of the album progressed rapidly, "Californication" itself remained a difficult song to complete. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble to accompany the powerful lyrics, but encountered difficulty.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 407</ref> The song was barely making progress, and was nearly scrapped had it not been for Kiedis' urgency to include it on the album. Only two days prior to recording did Frusciante set the final riff into place, and taught the rest of the band how to perform it."Californication" was intended to represent Californian lifestyles, and more specifically, the "fake" nature which is associated with much of [[Hollywood]].

The record was a change of style for the Chili Peppers, especially when compared to their previous album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', which combined various elements of [[psychedelic rock]] and [[Hard Rock|hard rock]]. Although ''Californication'' still contained traces of their once ubiquitous "punk funk" sound (such as "Purple Stain", "Get On Top", "I Like Dirt", "Around the World", and "Right on Time"), it leaned towards more melodic oriented riffs (for example, "[[Scar Tissue]]" and "[[Otherside]]") and focused on songs with implemented structure rather than [[jam session|jams]]. Experimental guitar work is consistent in "Savior", and "This Velvet Glove", as a [[Mellotron]] and other distortion methods were employed. The album includes multiple references to drugs and [[Hollywood]].<ref name="eweekly">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64068,00.html|title=''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|year=1999|author=David Browne}}</ref>

==Promotion and release==
The Chili Peppers decided to look for other options in who would produce ''Californication'', after working with [[Rick Rubin]] for two consecutive albums.<ref name=pg420>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 420</ref> [[David Bowie]] had shown great interest in working with the band and asked to produce the album; however, the Chili Peppers chose to remain with Rubin for ''Californication''.<ref name=pg420/> Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought necessary for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 230–232, 320–321, 344, 424</ref> Recording took place at Cello Studios in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Following the recording process, the band played "Scar Tissue", "Otherside", and "Californication" to their managers, in early 1999, where it was decided that "Scar Tissue" would be the lead single for the album.<ref name=srtisspg422>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 422</ref> To support their reunited line-up, the band played various proms across the country in order to promote ''Californication''.<ref name=srtisspg422/> It sprouted a competition, which called upon high school students to write essays on "...how they could make their schools better, safer, happier, more rocking places, so that they didn't have to go to school afraid. If you wrote the essay, you got a free ticket to the show".<ref name=srtisspg422/>

''Californication'' was released on [[June 8]], [[1999]], debuting at #5 but peaking at #3 on the [[Billboard Top 200]]. In Europe, the album peaked at #5 on the UK Top 40, #1 on the Finnish, Austrian, Swedish and New Zealand charts, and #2 on the French Top 40. It was [[RIAA certification|certified]] 'gold' just over a month later, on [[July 22]], [[1999]], and its continuing sales have resulted in it being certified five-times multi-platinum.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum: Diamond Awards|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)|date=undated|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblDiamond}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum: Searchable Database|publisher=RIAA|date=undated|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> With the return of [[John Frusciante]] playing [[guitar]], the Red Hot Chili Peppers managed to regain their critical acceptance after its less popular predecessor, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', and has achieved a far greater commercial success worldwide.

In March 2006, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums were made available to purchase on the [[iTunes Music Store]].<ref name="itunesrelease">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002200299|title="The Red Hot Chili Peppers' catalog is now available digitally for the first time"|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Billboard|author=Jonathan Cohen}}</ref> Albums bought there included new previously unreleased tracks ("Fat Dance", "Over Funk", and "Quixoticelixer"). The original tracks, unlike the bonus tracks, were not remastered.

==Critical reception==
''Californication'' gained positive critical acceptance in contrast to its less popular predecessor, ''One Hot Minute'', and was a greater success worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fpfwxq9hldfe|title=''One Hot Minute'' Album Review - Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: "[his] vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility."<ref name="rsreview"/> Songs such as "Otherside" and "Porcelain" were called "[[The Smashing Pumpkins|Pumpkins]]-esque", (in reference to their similarity in style to the work of the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]) while the album as a whole was "epiphinal" and that the "RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick."<ref name="rsreview"/> Other critics credited the album's success to the return of Frusciante. [[All Music Guide]]'s Greg Prato said that the "obvious reason for [the band's] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante", considering him to be the "quintessential RHCP guitarist".<ref name=AMGCalif>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:a9fuxqykld0e|author=Greg Prato|title=''Californication'' Review|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> The album as a whole was "a bona fide Chili Peppers classic".<ref name=AMGCalif/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also credits Frusciante with transforming the band's sound into a "more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before".<ref name=eweekly />

And while many critics found the band's new sound refreshing, ''[[NME]]'' scrutinized the Chili Peppers' for rarely utilizing their trademark funk sound, asking: "Can we have our brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle."<ref name=NMEreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/2974.htm|title=Californication Review|accessdate=2007-07-02|publisher=''NME''}}</ref> ''Pitchfork'', while considering the album a triumph over ''One Hot Minute'', felt ''Californication'' lacked the funk that was ever-present in ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref name=pitchfrkreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/21277-californication|title=Californication Review - Brent DiCrescenzo|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=Pitchfork Media}}</ref> It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be "the best big- time American rock guitarist going right now".<ref name=pitchfrkreview/>

The album received criticism for what Tim Anderson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called "excessive compression and distortion" in the process of digital remastering,<ref name="guardianquality">{{Cite web|url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/insideit/story/0,,1992466,00.html|title=How CDs are remastering the art of noise|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> and was the subject of an online petition which garnered over 1,000 signatures.<ref name="soundpetition">{{Cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com/RHCPWBCD/petition.html|title=Sound Quality petition|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Petition Online}}</ref> ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' labeled it as one of the victims of the [[loudness war]] and commented that it suffered from digital clipping so much that "even non-audiophile consumers complained about it".<ref>{{citeweb|title=''Californication'' Sound Quality|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/imperfect-sound-forever.htm|accessdate=2007-06-25|publisher=''Stylus Magazine''}}</ref>

Over the years, ''Californication'' has maintained its popularity. "Scar Tissue" won a [[Grammy]] award for best rock song in 2000.<ref name="2000grammys">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/2000/grammys/list.html|title=42nd Annual Grammy Awards nominations|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=CNN}}</ref> The album was ranked number 399 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's, 2003 list, of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]] and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for [[AOL Sessions]] that included "Californication" and "Scar Tissue".<ref name="aolsessions">{{Cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/red-hot-chili-peppers/5241/main|title=AOL Sessions|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=AOL Music}}</ref><ref name="rsgreatest">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6626238/399_californication|title=The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref><ref name=acclaimed>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/061024/A3752.htm|title=Accolades| accessdate=2007-06-05|publisher=AcclaimedMusic.net}}</ref> The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers; five of the sixteen songs on their ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album were taken from ''Californication''.<ref name="greasthitstracklisting">{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:jvfixqyaldse|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: Greatest Hits|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]}}</ref>

==''Californication'' tour==
[[Image:Johnfrusciante1.jpg|145px|thumb|right|[[John Frusciante]] in a live musical event during the ''Californication'' tour.]]
Immediately following the release of ''Californication'', the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close [[Woodstock '99]], which became infamous for the violence it resulted in.<ref name=scrtisspg423>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 423</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/red_hot_chili_peppers/bio.jhtml|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers bio|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=VH1}}</ref> The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields had gone out of control.<ref name=scrtisspg423/> When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's song "Fire" to finish their set, the disruption escalated into violence when several women who had been '[[crowd surfing]]' were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed.<ref>{{citeweb|Title=|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/woodstock27.htm|title=Woodstock '99 Goes Up in Smoke - Alona Wartofsky|accessdate=2007-06-28|publisher=''Washington Post''}}</ref><ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 424</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title=Police investigate alleged rapes at Woodstock '99|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9907/29/woodstock.rape/|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title="Repeated Violence"|publisher=The Lantern|url=http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2001/05/02/Opinion/Repeated.Violence-74898.shtml?sourcedomain=www.thelantern.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Kiedis felt that "It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... We woke up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing 'Fire'."<ref name=p424>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 424</ref>

To kick off the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]], on [[August 14]], [[1999]], to a crowd of over 200,000.<ref name=scrtisspage426/> Kiedis recalled the situation: "Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that we needed a police escort to get near the stage."<ref name=scrtisspage426>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 426</ref> Following the European leg, the group did a show in [[New York City]], at the [[Windows on the World]], for [[KROQ-FM|K-Rock]] radio contest-winners, and then at the [[Big Day Out]] festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates.<ref>Kiedis, page 427</ref> Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the ''Californication'' tour.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 435</ref> As one of the last shows before the release of their next album ''[[By the Way]]'', the Chili Peppers played [[Rock in Rio|Rock in Rio 3]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/robbiewilliams/articles/story/5923718/really_randoms_robbie_williams_eminem|title="Really Randoms" November 01, 2000 (paragraph 9)|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=''Rolling Stone'' magazine}}</ref>
