'''''Age of Mythology''''' (commonly abbreviated as '''''AoM'''''), is a [[mythology]]-based, [[real-time strategy]] [[Personal computer game|computer game]] developed by [[Ensemble Studios]], and published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]]. It was released on [[November 1]], [[2002]] in [[North America]], and a week later in [[Europe]].<ref name="release" />

''Age of Mythology'' focuses less on historical accuracy than the previous games by Ensemble Studios and Microsoft Games&mdash;namely, the ''[[Age of Empires series]]''&mdash;but instead centers upon the [[mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], and [[Norse mythology|Norse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/civs/|title=Age of Mythology civilizations on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> Its campaign follows an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] admiral, [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Arkantos|Arkantos]], who is forced to travel through the lands of the three civilizations in the game, hunting for a cyclops who has turned [[Poseidon]] against Atlantis.<ref name=EuroGamerReview>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=4138|title=Age of Mythology|accessdate=2007-05-26|publisher=Eurogamer|first=Rob|last=Fahey|published=2002-12-10}}</ref>

Four months after its release, ''Age of Mythology'' went platinum, selling over 1,000,000 units.<ref name=plat>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/mar03/03-11platinummythologypr.mspx|title="Age of Mythology" Goes Platinum With More Than 1 Million Units Sold|publisher=Microsoft PressPass|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> General manager for PC games at [[Microsoft]], Stuart Moulder, said that "The worldwide popularity of the entire franchise continues to grow, while the fans' excitement inspires the development team at Ensemble Studios to create more innovative games each year."<ref name=plat />

''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans]]'', an expansion to ''Age of Mythology'', was released on [[September 30]], [[2003]].<ref name=TitansRelease>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythologytitans/index.html?q=Age%20of%20Mythology:%20The%20Titans&tag=result;title;0 |title=Age of Mythology: The Titans|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> The expansion contained a new civilization; the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], and several new units, including the [[Titan (mythology)|titans]]. Critics and fans received the expansion with enthusiasm, although its ratings were not as high as that of the original version.<ref name=WP>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_of_Mythology:_The_Titans&oldid=147247936|title=Age of Mythology:The Titans|publisher=[[English Wikipedia]]|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Like many other [[real-time strategy]] games, ''Age of Mythology'' is based on building towns, gathering resources, creating armies, and ultimately destroying enemy units and buildings. In this way, players are able to defeat and conquer rival towns and civilizations. Players advance their tribe through four "Ages": starting in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Age]], the player may upgrade to the [[Classical Age]], Heroic Age, and, finally, the Mythic Age. Each upgrade to a higher Age unlocks new units and technologies for the player, which strengthens their town. Conversely, upgrading requires a large amount of resources to be paid, and certain buildings to be built.<Ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apple.com/games/articles/2003/09/ageofmythology/|title=Apple Games page on Age of Mythology|accessdate=2007-07-04|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]}}</ref>  

[[Image:Age of Mythology ingame screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|In this screenshot, an Egyptian town is under attack by the Norse, and is defending itself using the meteor god power.]]
There are three playable civilizations in ''Age of Mythology'': the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse. Each civilization has three "[[List of Major Gods in Age of Mythology and The Titans|major gods]]"&mdash;deities such as [[Zeus]] or [[Odin]]. The player chooses their major god before the game begins.  Every time a player advances to the next age, a "[[List of Minor Gods in Age of Mythology and The Titans|minor god]]" is selected. Minor gods are slightly less historically significant than their major counterparts. Some minor gods include [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]] and [[Hel (being)|Hel]].<ref name="gamershell">{{cite web | last = Burrell | first = M. | title = Age of Mythology Review - GamersHell.com | publisher = GamersHell.com | url = http://www.gamershell.com/pc/age_of_mythology/review.html | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref> All gods have unique technologies, myth units, and a unique god power, which is a special ability that can either damage an opponent, or benefit the player that uses it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensemblestudios.com/Games/AgeOfMythology/Default.aspx|title=Age of Mythology page on Ensemble Studios Website|publisher=[[Ensemble Studios]]|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>

There are four major resources in ''Age of Mythology'': [[food]], [[wood]], [[gold]], and [[wiktionary:favour|favor]]; unlike previous games by Ensemble Studios, this game does not include the [[stone]] resource. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things. Civilian units&mdash;namely, the Greek [[villager]]s, Norse [[gatherer]]s and [[dwarf]]s, and the Egyptian [[laborer]]s, and [[fishing boat]]s&mdash;are used to gather resources. [[Hunt|Hunting]] animals, gathering berries, [[Harvest|harvesting]] livestock, [[Farm|farming]], and [[fishing]] are all methods by which food can be gathered. Wood is gathered only by chopping down trees, and gold is gathered from either gold mines or from [[trade]]. Each civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Favor is acquired in different ways be different civilizations; Greek players gain it by having villagers pray at [[temple]]s, Egyptian players earn it by building [[monument]]s, and Norse players receive it by fighting, or by possessing heroes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/units/norse/hersir.htm|title=Age of Mythology Heaven Hersir info|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> Resources can be exchanged at a player's [[market]].

===Units===
[[Image:Age of Mythology scarab beetle.gif|thumb|left|A mythological [[Khepri|scarab beetle]].]]
{{main|List of Units in Age of Mythology and The Titans}}

The bulk of each civilization’s army is made of human soldiers. Each civilization has a maximum number of "population slots," although the player does not start with all of these available. Building additional houses or Town Centers increases the population capacity. Each unit takes up a different number of population slots; civilians take one, whilst some myth units can take up to five.<ref name=buildings /> Most units can be upgraded, making them better at certain tasks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/units|title= Age of Mythology Heaven Unit Guide|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref>

Units can be classified into seven categories; [[infantry]], [[archer]]s, [[cavalry]] (the three of which are broadly classified as [[Human|human units]]), [[Siege|siege weaponry]], [[Naval|naval units]], [[hero]]es, and [[Mythology|myth units]].<ref name="gamespotreview>{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythology/review.html|title=Gamespot review on Age of Mythology|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2007-06-04|first=Greg|last=Kasavin|date=2002-11-02}}</ref>
The [[rock-paper-scissors]] model governs most units in battle. For example, infantry do additional damage to cavalry, cavalry do additional damage to archers, and archers do additional damage to infantry. The same rock-paper-scissors formation exists in the three different types of naval units&mdash;arrow ships, siege ships, and hammer ships. Siege units are generally exempt from the rock-paper-scissors model, but are instead able to destroy [[building]]s easily. Heroes are extremely effective against myth units, which in turn do large amounts of damage against human units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/units/greek/hero|title=Greek Hero Units|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> Heroes are also able to collect [[relic]]s, which grant the player additional economic or military bonuses when deposited in the player’s temple.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/relics|title= Relics page on Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-05-04|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven}}</ref>

===Buildings===
Buildings in ''Age of Mythology'' can generally be split into three categories; [[Economy|economic buildings]], [[Military|military buildings]], and [[Defense (military)|defensive structures]]. The most important economic building is the Town Center (similar to the building of the same name in other ''[[Age of Empires series]]'' games). All civilian units are trained at the Town Center, as are some vital technologies. Most importantly, players advance through the ages via the building.  The Town Center provides 15 population slots, and building additional houses will earn the player ten additional slots per house.<ref name=buildings>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/buildings.html|title= Buildings on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> Other economic buildings include the [[farm]] and [[market]]. 

Buildings are able to research technologies and upgrades, as well as provide resources for the player. However, they are unable to fight or train units.<ref name=buildings /> All units except civilians are trained at military buildings. These buildings differ in name and usage between civilization, but all are able to train similar units. Military buildings are also used to research military specific technologies, such as armor upgrades and attack improvements.<ref name=buildings /> 

[[Wall]]s [[Guard Tower|towers]] are defensive structures, which are not able to train units, and are used only for the purposes of defense. They are able to research some upgrades, although these are generally only useful to the building performing the research.<ref name=buildings /> Another type of building available to players, is a [[Monument|Wonder]]; a grand building that represents an architectural achievement of the civilization. In certain game modes, once a player builds a wonder, a ten minute countdown begins. If the wonder is still standing after the countdown ends, the player who built the wonder wins.<ref name=buildings />

===Multiplayer=== 

[[Image:AoMTournament.jpg|right|thumb|Participants in an ''Age of Mythology'' Tournament.]]
[[Multiplayer game|Multiplayer]] is highly popular aspect of ''Age of Mythology''.  Most multiplayer games are played through [[Ensemble Studios|Ensemble Studios Online (ESO)]], or via a direct [[LAN]] or [[Internet Protocol|IP]] connection.

''Age of Mythology'' includes one free multiplayer account on ESO. Similar in function to [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s [[Battle.net]], ESO allows players to play matches and chat with other players.<ref name="AoMH-ESO">{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/faq/eso|title=Ensemble Studios Online (ESO) FAQ|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>

In multiplayer games, there are seven different game types available;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/display.cgi?action=st&fn=1&tn=7123&st=16#post17|title=How many game modes are there in AoM?|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven Forums|work=ES_Bigdog|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>
*''Supremacy'' &ndash; standard game, includes randomly generated map and all gameplay aspects.
*''Conquest'' &ndash; similar to Supremacy, but victory is only possible by defeating all other players.
*''Deathmatch'' &ndash; players begin the game with high resources, but the game is otherwise the same as Supremacy.
*''Lightning'' &ndash; similar to Supremacy, but the game plays at double speed.
*''Nomad'' &ndash; players start with one civilian unit and no Town Center, and must build up on a settlement before continuing.
*''King of the Hill'' &ndash; players must fight for control of a monument in the center of the map for a set period of time.
*''Sudden Death'' &ndash; If a player's Town Center is destroyed, they have a set period of time to rebuild it before they lose the game.

Multiplayer [[tournament]]s and [[LAN]] parties are also popular throughout the world, with players flocking to computer [[Computer gaming#Multiplayer|gaming lounge]]s to participate.

===Scenario editor===
[[Image:Age of Mythology Editor.png|thumb|left|The ''Age of Mythology'' scenario editor: visible is a large statue surrounded by deep waters, and the "rotate camera angle" controls, which allow for construction of more complex custom scenarios.]]
The ''Age of Mythology'' editor is far more advanced then that of its predecessor; ''[[Age of Empires II]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macsoftgames.com/products/age_of_myth/macsoft-aom-page.html|title= Age of Mythology on MacSoft Games|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=MacSoft}}</ref> As well as standard unit placement facilities, the editor allows units to be overlapped, and it facilitates for large mountains, and steep terrain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/scendesign/basics/elevation|title=Elevation in Scenario Editor|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> Triggers, a popular aspect of scenario design in ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', are also present in ''Age of Mythology''’s editor, as are [[cinematic]]s and other [[special effects]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/scendesign/dictionary|title=Scenario Editor Glossary|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven}}</ref>

==Campaign==
Unlike the campaign modes in ''[[Age of Empires]]'' and ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', ''Age of Mythology'' only has one central [[Military campaign|campaign]].

Age of Mythology’s campaign is entitled ''Fall of the Trident'', and tells the story of [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Arkantos|Arkantos]], an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] admiral who is sent on a quest with the goal of regaining favor from [[Poseidon]], God of the Atlantean people.<ref name=EuroGamerReview>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=4138|title= Age of Mythology review|accessdate=2007-05-26|publisher=Eurogamer|first=Rob|last=Fahey|published=2002-12-10}}</ref>

Arkantos’ quest takes him to the [[Trojan War]], where he meets [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Ajax|Ajax]], [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]], and [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Odysseus|Odysseus]].  After assisting them in winning the war, he continues in his travels, and meets [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Chiron|Chiron]].  Chiron advises him to follow the [[cyclops]], [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Gargarensis|Gargarensis]], a follower of [[Poseidon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/overview.html|title= Age of Mythology overview|accessdate=2007-05-26|publisher=MacGamer.net}}</ref>  Arkantos, Ajax, and Chiron travel through the [[Erebus|Underworld]] in their search for Gargarensis, and end up in [[Egypt]].

In Egypt, Arkantos meets [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Amanra|Amanra]], a mercenary queen, who asks for his assistance in domestic issues.  He obliges, and assists her in defeating an ally of Gargarensis, [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Kemsyt|Kemsyt]]. While in Egypt, Arkantos learns the true story about Gargarensis: he hopes to gain immortality by freeing the Titan [[Cronus|Kronos]] from [[Tartarus]].<ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythology/review.html|title=Age of Mythology for PC Review|work=[[Gamespot]]|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>  He continues north, still in search of Gargarensis.

In the Norse lands, Arkantos meets [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Reginleif|Reginleif]], a [[valkyrie]], and together they attempt to prevent [[Ragnarok]] from taking place.  They encounter Gargarensis again, and he traps them in a small valley with no escape.  In this valley, they must survive onslaughts from Gargarensis’ forces, and wait for aid from Odysseus.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/376/376253p1.html|title= IGN Review|accessdate=2007-05-11|publisher=[[IGN]]|published=2002-11-04|first=Steve|last=Butts}}</ref>

Whilst the heroes are fighting Gargarensis’ forces, he establishes himself in Atlantis, locking up its former leaders. To conclude the campaign, Arkantos and his allies march on Atlantis, and [[Zeus]] bestows his blessing upon Arkantos, giving him the power to defeat Poseidon and Gargarensis.  After killing Poseidon’s living statue and Gargarensis, Arkantos falls in exhaustion, and is then immortalized by [[Athena]] and becomes a God.

==Development==
Ensemble Studios began work on their first fully 3D [[game engine|engine]] in parallel to their development of ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings]]''. Christened the BANG! Engine, this was announced in [[January]] [[2001]] for use in a new game, codenamed ''RTSIII''. ''RTSIII'' would eventually become ''Age of Mythology''.<ref name=GameSpot>{{cite web|title=Ensemble Studios Interview|url=http://gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythology/news.html?sid=2680346|work=Amer Ajami|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2001-01-31|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>

[[Image:AoMGreekScreenie.jpg|thumb|right|This shows the start of a random map game.  The Town Center can be seen on the left, three villagers in the center, and a scout moving south.  There also two sentry towers visible.]]
In developing ''Age of Mythology'', Ensemble Studios decided to move away from the center of the ''Age of Empires Series''; history, to avoid becoming stale and repetitive. This allowed them to work with new ideas and concepts.<ref name=C&VG>{{cite web|title=Interview: Rock of Ages|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=78972|author=Stuart Bishop|publisher=[[Computer and Video Games (magazine)|C&VG]]|date=2002-08-19|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>

Following the announcement of the game for [[September]] [[2002]],<ref name=GameZone>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/news/12_17_01_12_32PM.htm|title=Age of Mythology announced|work=GameZone Online|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> a [[Game demo|trial]] version was released to the public.<ref name=AoMHTrial>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/dl/demo|title=Age of Mythology Trial|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  This contained a shortened version of the game’s campaign (5 scenarios) and two random maps.  In the trial version, the player could select any of the nine Gods available in the full version of the game.<ref name=AoMHTrial />

''Age of Mythology'' underwent a large amount of [[Video game development|play-testing]] during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented that one of the reasons ''Age of Mythology'' is so popular is because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a "faceless drone in another building."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/devdiary/september02/aom3/|last=Street|first=Greg T.|title=Age of Mythology: Volume III|accessdate=2007-04-29|date=2002-09-05|publisher=GameSpy}}</ref>

There was much debate during ''Age of Mythology''’s construction concerning the unbalanced nature of God powers, and how to make them “fair”, whilst still maintaining an element of fun in them. It was concluded that the best way to make it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/devdiary/august02/aom2/|title=Age of Mythology: Volume II|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2007-04-29|last=Street|first= Greg T.|date=2002-08-21}}</ref>

On [[September 30]], [[2003]], [[Ensemble Studios]] released an expansion to ''Age of Mythology'', entitled ''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans]]''.<ref name=TitansRelease />  It contained a new civilization, the Atlanteans, as well as new units and a new mythological race, the [[Titan (mythology)|titans]]. The expansion was received well by critics and fans alike, though its rating was not as high as that of the original.<ref name=WP />

==Soundtrack==
A [[soundtrack]] to ''Age of Mythology'' was released on [[October 22]], [[2002]], under the [[record label]] "Sumthing Else".<ref name=soundtrackrelease>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/5356137/a/Age+Of+Mythology.htm|title=Age of Mythology Soundtrack CD|publisher=CD Universe|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref>  Music director Steven Rippy said the game's score, and soundtrack, were based on musicians including [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tuatara]], and [[Bill Laswell]], as well as the video game ''[[Grim Fandango]]''.<ref name=IGNSound>{{cite web|title=Age of Music|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/370/370283p1.html|work=Steve Butts|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref>  He also said that the musical work done on ''Age of Mythology'' was unlike anything he had done before. An example of this was "writing for a seventy-piece orchestra and then flying out to Washington to record it."<ref name="ignageofmusic">
{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/370/370283p1.html|title=IGN: Age of Music|publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]]|accessdate=2007-07-29|author=Butts, Steven|date=2002-09-06|quote=writing for a seventy-piece orchestra and then flying out to Washington to record it."}}</ref> Sound artist Kevin McMullan agreed, stating that "working with a live orchestra and creating a dynamic music system have been the most unique aspects of this project."<ref name=IGNSound />

In their review of the soundtrack, Avalanche Online stated that "''Age of Mythology'' has an acustic [''[[sic]]''] sound that brings you back to the Earth's roots."<ref name="avalancheonline">{{cite web|url=http://www.avalancheonline.com/ageofmythology.htm|title=Age of Mythology Soundtrack Review|publisher=Avalanche Online|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref> The only criticism in the review was for the 16th track; "Gary's Reserve," with the reviewer writing "Whatever possessed them to place a jazzy dance track on the end of the wondrous non electric musical heaven and make it feel so out of place is beyond me."<ref name="avalancheonline" /> Regardless of this, the soundtrack was still rated 10 out of 10, and its review concluded with the statement "I really cannot enthuse over this soundtrack enough."<ref name="avalancheonline" />
