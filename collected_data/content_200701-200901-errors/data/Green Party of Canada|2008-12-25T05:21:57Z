{{Green politics sidebar |expanded=all}}
The '''Green Party of Canada''' is a [[Canadian]] [[political parties of Canada|federal]] [[political party]] founded in [[1983 in Canada|1983]] with 10,000-12,000 registered members as of October 2008.<ref>Youmans, Jason. [http://www.mondaymag.com/articles/entry/its-not-easy-being-green It’s Not Easy Being Green]. ''[[Monday Magazine]]''. October 1, 2008.</ref> The Greens, as their name indicates, advocate [[green politics]] and are the largest party in Canada to focus primarily on green politics, though other parties have included environmental stances in their platforms. It has been led by [[Elizabeth May]] since August 26, 2006.

The party never broke 1% of the popular vote until the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], when it received 4.3% and qualified for federal funding. Its support has ranged between 4.5% and 14% since the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] and it has not polled below 6% in [[Opinion polling in the Canadian federal election, 2008|any opinion poll from 2007 onwards]]. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]], the Green Party of Canada was invited to the debates for the first time<ref name="debates" /> and achieved a high mark of 6.8% of the popular vote. With just under a million votes, it was the only federally-funded party to receive more votes than in 2006, but it still failed to win any seats. 

On August 30, 2008, independent MP [[Blair Wilson]] joined the Green Party and became its first [[Member of Parliament]]. He was defeated in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]], which was called before he had a chance to officially sit in the [[House of Commons (Canada)|House of Commons]] as a Green MP.

== History ==
{{main|History of the Green Party of Canada}}

About one month before the 1980 federal election, eleven candidates, mostly from ridings in the Atlantic provinces, issued a joint press release declaring that they were running on a common platform. It called for a transition to a non-nuclear, conserver society. Although they ran as independents, they unofficially used the name "Small Party" as part of their declaration of unity - a reference to the "small is beautiful" philosophy of E. F. Schumacher. This was the most substantial early attempt to answer the call for an ecologically-oriented Canadian political party. A key organizer (and one of the candidates) was Elizabeth May, who is now leader of the Greens.

The Green Party of Canada was founded at a conference held at Carleton University in Ottawa in 1983. Under its first leader, Dr. [[Trevor Hancock]], the party ran 60 candidates in the [[1984 Canadian federal election]].<ref>"[http://main.greenparty.ca/history.html?&MMN_position=5:3 History of the Green Party of Canada]," Green Party of Canada website</ref>

The Green Party of Canada is independent of other green parties around the world. However, all Green parties share the same philosophy. Its provincial counterparts in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, support green economics, progressive social planning, and responsible and accountable governance.

The Quebec wing hosted the 1990 Canadian Greens conference in Montreal. But soon after that, Canada's constitutional problems interfered, and many Quebec candidates abandoned the Greens in favour of a Quebec sovereigntist party, the [[Bloc Québécois]]. There were only six Green candidates from Quebec in the 1993 election. In the spring of 1996, although the hopes of electing a representative to the BC legislature proved premature, Andy Shadrack in the interior of the province received over 11% of the vote. Overall, the party's proportion of the popular vote surged to a new high. Shadrack was also the most popular Green candidate in the 1997 federal election, scoring over 6% of the popular vote in West Kootenay-Okanagan.

=== Joan Russow years ===

British Columbia's Joan Russow became leader of the Green Party of Canada on April 13, 1997.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/election/2000Federal/candidates-new/1642.html Globe and Mail Election 2000]</ref><ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/testcase/russow.pdf. Affidavit of Joan Russow]</ref> Russow won 52% of the ballots cast in the 1997 leadership race, surpassing Ontario's [[Jim Harris]] (39%) and Rachelle Small (8%). Immediately upon attaining the leadership, Russow was plunged into a federal general election.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> Russow's campaign in 1997 set a number of important precedents. [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]] was the first campaign in which the Greens conducted a national leader's tour, presented a national platform and a bilingual campaign. Previous campaigns, due in part to the party's few resources and, in part, to the party's constitutional straitjacket, had been characterized by policy and spokespeople operating, at best, province-by-province and, at worst, riding-by-riding. In her own riding of [[Victoria (electoral district)|Victoria]], Russow received just shy of 3000 votes and 6% of the popular vote.

Since its inception, the party has been developing as an organization, expanding its membership and improving its showing at the polls. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal election]], the party fielded 111 candidates, up from 78 in 1997.

Candidates were not run in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], as a result of ongoing divisions over Joan Russow's refusal to endorse the Green candidate in an earlier St. John's West by-election. (The candidate in question supported the seal hunt and mining development, as most locals did.)<ref name="autogenerated1">http://www.infonet.st-johns.nf.ca/providers/green/policy.html</ref> This caused much uncertainty and friction between Newfoundland's Terra Nova Green Party<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Association and the Green Party leader as the party gradually adapted to the realities of functioning as a true national party rather than a disorganized federation of local activists.

The conflicts left Russow isolated and alienated from most members of the party. Volunteer efforts were substantially absorbed in provincial campaigns between 2001 and 2003, and the federal party became dormant between elections, as was typical in the past. [[Chris Bradshaw]] served the party as interim leader from 2001 to February 2003.

=== Breakthrough under Jim Harris  ===

In February 2003, [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], in his second bid for the leadership, defeated [[John Grogan]] of [[Valemount]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Jason Crummey]]. Crummey was originally from Newfoundland and involved with Newfoundland and Labrador Terra Nova Greens.

During the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] the Green Party of Canada made history when it became only the fourth federal political party ever to run candidates in all 308 ridings. When the ballots were counted, the Green Party secured 4.3 percent of the popular vote, thereby surpassing the 2 percent threshold required for party financing under new [[Elections Canada]] rules.<ref>"[http://www.elections.ca/scripts/webpep/fin/summary_report.aspx Financial summary]," Elections Canada website</ref>

Momentum continued to build around the Green Party of Canada and in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] the Green Party again ran 308 candidates and increased its share of the popular vote to 4.5 percent, once again securing federal financing as a result.

The party's [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 election campaign]] was disrupted by allegations made by Matthew Pollesell, the party's former assistant national organizer, that Harris had not filed a proper accounting of money spent during his 2004 leadership campaign, as required by law. Pollesell issued a request that Elections Canada investigate. Pollesell and another former party member, Gretchen Schwarz, were subsequently warned by the party's legal counsel to retract allegations they had made or face a possible legal action. Dana Miller, who served in the party's shadow cabinet with responsibility for human-rights issues, made public her earlier complaints that the party has violated election law and its own constitution and has also asked for an Elections Canada investigation. Miller had been expelled from the party after filing a complaint within the party in April.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20051229/ELXNGREENS29/TPNational/?query=%22jim+harris%22 globeandmail.com<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

=== Elizabeth May years ===

A [[leadership convention|leadership vote]] was held at the party's August 2006 convention. On April 24, 2006, [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]] announced his intention not to stand for re-election as party leader.<ref>"[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060424.wxgreen24/BNStory/National/home Harris to give up on Green leadership,]" [[Globe and Mail]], April 24, 2006.</ref> Three candidates officially entered the leadership race: [[David Chernushenko]], [[Elizabeth May]], and [[Jim Fannon]].  May won the leadership with 65% of the vote on the first ballot.

On October 22, 2006, [[Elizabeth May]] announced she would run in the federal by-election to be held on November 27, 2006 in [[London North Centre]], [[Ontario]]. She finished second behind the Liberal candidate but garnered 26% of the popular vote. 

On August 30, 2008, Vancouver area MP [[Blair Wilson]] became the first-ever Green Member of Parliament, after sitting for nearly a year of the [[39th Canadian Parliament]] as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]. He had been a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] MP, but stepped down voluntarily from the caucus earlier in the parliament after anonymous allegations of campaign finance irregularities, most of which he was later cleared after a 9-month investigation by [[Elections Canada]].<ref>{{cite news

  |accessdate=2008-08-30 }}</ref> Wilson had joined the Green Party during Parliament's summer recess and never sat in the House of Commons as a Green MP. 

After initial opposition from three of the four major political parties, May was invited to the leaders' debates."<ref name="debates">[http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAN1039064420080910 ''Greens win spot in TV election debates'', Reuters Canada, September 10, 2008], (accessed September 10, 2008)</ref> In the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]], the party increased its share of the popular vote by 2.33% (to 6.80%), being the only federally-funded party to increase its total vote tally over 2006, attracting nearly 280,000 new votes. However, the party failed to elect a candidate and finished the election either $2 million<ref name="resignation" /> or $4 million<ref>[http://thechronicleherald.ca/NovaScotia/1085050.html]</ref> in debt. There was criticism from prominent Green Party members of May's failing to support all Green candidates unequivocally during the 2008 election, as she made favorable comments about Liberal leader [[Stéphane Dion]] and said that supporters in close ridings might consider voting strategically to attempt to defeat the Conservatives. This may have left Green candidates with vote totals short of Election Canada's reimbursement threshold, as well as reducing the party's subsidy based on popular vote.<ref name="resignation">[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081016.wgreens17/BNStory/politics/home?cid=al_gam_mostview May fends off calls for her resignation]</ref>

== Policies ==
The GPC had originally adopted a form of the Ten Key Values originally authored by the [[United States Green Party]].

The August 2002 Convention adopted the [[Six Principles]] of the [[Global Greens Charter|Charter]] of the [[Global Greens]], as stated by the Global Greens Conference held in Canberra, Australia in 2001. These principles are the only ones included in the GPC constitution.

An emphasis on a [[green tax shift]] in the 2004 platform, which favoured partially reducing income and corporate taxes (while increasing taxes on polluters and energy consumers), created questions as to whether the Green Party was still [[left-wing politics|on the left]] of the political spectrum, or was taking a more [[eco-capitalist]] approach by reducing [[progressive taxation]] in favour of [[regressive taxation]]. Green Party policy writers have challenged this interpretation by claiming that any unintended "regressive" tax consequences from the application of a Green Tax Shift would be intentionally offset by changes in individual tax rates and categories as well as an 'eco-tax" refund for those who pay no tax.

The Green Party of Canada platform does promote some policies usually associated with the left.  It calls for an end to homelessness via subsidized housing, promotes a guaranteed livable income, and opposes private sector involvement in public health, education and prison services.

As early as 2000, the party had published platform comparisons indicating the reasons why supporters of any of the five other Canadian federal political parties should consider voting Green. The Greens have always had right-wing, leftist and centrist factions that have been ascendant at different times in the party's history. Many Greens also claim that this traditional left-right political spectrum analysis does not accurately capture the pragmatic ecological orientation of an evolving Green Party.<ref>Martin, Chip. [http://www.lfpress.com/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=162720&x=articles&s=elections Left, right support Green] ''London Free Press''</ref>

The ecumenical approach (expressing affinities with all Canadian political tendencies and making cases to voters on all parts of the left-right spectrum) has been advocated by those who believe their success can be measured by the degree to which other parties adopt Green Party policies. While the Green Party has drawn its increased support from all the major political parties in Canada, including some former [[Red Tory]] supporters of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], it has however not been discerned the degree to which this process has contributed to phenomena like the Liberal Party of Canada adopting several key items which also appear in the Green program, such as accelerated [[Capital Cost Allowance]] deductions restricted to [[sustainable technology]] only, and the adoption of the [[ecological and social indicator]]s and [[green procurement]] rules Greens have long advocated. Neither have the relative degrees of influence been discerned which non-partisan environmental groups and the party's own Green wing have in developing the policies of the Green Party.

Under Elizabeth May's leadership, the Green Party has begun to receive more mainstream media attention on other party policy not directly related to the environment — for example, supporting labour rights<ref>[http://www.greenparty.ca/en/releases/09.02.2007B Green Party Press Release, 09/02/2007]</ref> and poppy legalization in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>[http://www.greenparty.ca/en/releases/08.29.2007 Green Party Press Release, 08/29/2007]</ref> 

== Leadership ==

[[Image:Elizabeth May.jpg|thumb|120px|Green leader [[Elizabeth May]].]]

Long-time environmental activist and lawyer Elizabeth May won the leadership of the federal Green party at a convention in Ottawa on August 26, 2006. May won with 2,145 votes, or 65.3 per cent of the valid ballots cast defeating two other candidates. The second-place finisher [[David Chernushenko]], an environmental consultant, owner of Green & Gold Inc. and two time candidate, collected 1,096 votes or 33.3 per cent of the total, while [[Jim Fannon]], real estate agent at [[RE/MAX]] Garden City Realty, four time candidate and founder of Nature's Hemp finished a distant third, collecting just 29 votes or 0.88 per cent of the vote of the vote. ("None of the above" finished last with 13 votes or 0.44 per cent of the final vote.)<ref>Canadian Press,[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FRTGAM.20060826.wmay0greens0826%2FBNStory%2FNational%2Fhome&ord=10584270&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true  May wins Green Party leadership]</ref>

On November 21, 2006, May appointed outgoing [[Green Party of British Columbia]] leader [[Adriane Carr]] and [[Quebec]] television host [[Claude Genest]] as [[Deputy Leader]]s of the Party.<ref>[http://www.greenparty.ca/mediarelease196.html Elizabeth May Announces Prominent Greens Adriane Carr and Claude William Genest as Deputy Leaders of federal Green Party] Green Party of Canada press release, November 21, 2006.</ref> [[David Chernushenko]], who ran against [[Elizabeth May]] for the party leadership, was the Senior Deputy to the Leader for the first year after [[Elizabeth May]] was elected leader.

Previous leader [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]] was first elected to the office with over 80% of the vote and the support of the leaders of all of the provincial level Green parties. He was re-elected on the first ballot by 56% of the membership in a leadership challenge vote in August 2004. [[Tom Manley]] placed second with over 30% of the vote. A few months after the 2004 convention, Tom Manley was appointed Deputy Leader. On September 23, 2005, Manley left the party to join the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].

=== Electoral status ===
The Green Party fielded candidates in all 308 of the nation's [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] in the last two federal elections. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], the Green Party received 4.5% of the popular vote, only slightly more than in 2004, despite having received public funding (over $1 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] per year) for the first time and receiving more media coverage. A reason for the slow growth might be that in that election, left-leaning supporters of the party were encouraged to vote Liberal (by Liberals) in order to prevent a majority government by the right-wing Conservative party.

No Green Party candidate has yet been elected to the federal or provincial level of government in Canada, but the [[West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country]] MP, [[Blair Wilson]] joined the Green Party on August 30, 2008. He became the first Green Party elected official at the federal level. Wilson became a Green Member while Parliament was on summer break and thus never sat in the House of Commons as a Green MP. Members of the party have achieved municipal offices, though most were elected as individuals and not on Green Party slates or labels in local (at least officially) non-partisan municipal elections. However, some people have been elected with a Green Party affiliation identified directly on the ballot. The first two were elected in the 1999 municipal elections (20 November 1999):
* Art Vanden Berg, elected as a City Councillor in Victoria, British Columbia, and
* Roslyn Cassells, elected to the Vancouver Parks Board on the same day.<ref>City of Vancouver, [http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/election99/results/all.htm#parks Election Summary Report] November 20, 1999</ref>

Current Greens in office include:
* Mayor Ken Melamed of [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler, BC]]
* Councillor [[Jane Sterk]] in [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt, BC]]
* Councillor Sonya Chandler in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria, BC]]
* Councillor [[Rick Goldring]] in [[Burlington, Ontario]]

Andrea Reimer was elected as a trustee on the Vancouver School Board in 2002 as a Green. Former Councillor Elio Di Iorio was narrowly defeated in his 2006 reelection bid in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]] and former Councillor Rob Strang did not run for reelection in [[Orangeville, Ontario]]. The late [[Richard Thomas (Ontario politician)|Richard Thomas]] served as reeve of [[Armour, Ontario|Armour Township, Ontario]] from 2003 until his death in 2006. There are about 16 other Greens elected to local governments in BC.

=== Exclusion from debates ===
In the 2004 election, the consortium of Canadian television networks did not invite Jim Harris to the televised [[Canadian leaders debates|leaders debate]]s. The primary reason given for this was the party's lack of representation in the House of Commons. There were unsuccessful legal actions by the party, a petition by its supporters to have it included, and statements by non-supporters such as [[Ed Broadbent]] who believed it should be included.

The Green Party was also not included in the leaders' debates for the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 election]].<ref>"[http://www.ccnmatthews.com/news/releases/show.jsp?action=showRelease&searchText=false&showText=all&actionFor=570003 Leaders' Debate,]" Green Party of Canada press release, November 30, 2005.</ref> The same reason was given,<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/ombudsman/page/green_party_debate.pdf CBC ombudsman's review], 2006</ref> although some also believed the party's lack of visibility and meaningful input into Canadian federal budgets and bills was a factor{{Fact|who are the some people?  where did this come from?||date=September 2008}}.

On September 8, 2008, the consortium announced that they would once again exclude the Greens from the French and English debates for the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 election]], to be held on October 1 and 2 respectively. The party had secured a seat in the House at this point (Blair Wilson), satisfying the necessary criteria used in all previous debates dating to at least 1993. (Wilson was not ''elected'' as a Green MP; however, the situation parallels that of the Bloc Québécois in 1993 — to that point, all its members had been elected as either Conservatives or Liberals or, in [[Gilles Duceppe]]'s case, as an independent, before the group formally registered as a political party. The Bloc was nevertheless included in the 1993 debates.)

However, the consortium said that three parties (later identified as the Conservatives, NDP, and one other party) had threatened to boycott the debate if the Green Party was included, and that it had decided it was better to proceed with the four larger parties "in the interest of Canadians". Liberal leader Stéphane Dion supported May's inclusion in the debates but said he would also pull out if Harper withdrew. Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe said that while his party is against the Greens' inclusion, he would attend the debate whether or not they were included.<ref>MacCharles, Tonda. [http://www.thestar.com/FederalElection/article/495684 Greens slam debate exclusion]. ''The Toronto Star''. September 9, 2008.</ref> The Green Party said it would sue to force the consortium to allow it to participate.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2008/08/c2613.html Debate consortium press release], September 8, 2008</ref><ref>[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/cbc/080908/canada/news_greens_debates Greens can't participate in leaders' debate], Yahoo! Canada, September 8, 2008</ref>

This was not necessary, however, because of the networks' reversal two days later.  Many people protested the threatened boycott of Layton and Harper by staging protests, and phoning in and emailing the networks and the opposing parties, prompting both parties to recant their position.<ref>{{cite web |title=Green leader allowed into debates, networks confirm |work=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/story/2008/09/10/elxn-may-debates.html |accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref>

== Internet innovation ==
While the organizing and election planning was centralized, policy development was to be decentralized. In February 2004, the Green Party of Canada Living Platform was initiated by the Party's former Head of Platform and Research, Michael Pilling, to open the party's [[participatory democracy]] to the public to help validate its policies against broad public input. It also made it easy for candidates to share their answers to public interest group questionnaires, find the best answers to policy questions, and for even rural and remote users, and Canadians abroad, to contribute to Party policy intelligence.

== Membership exclusions ==
In 1998, the party adopted a rule that forbids membership in any other federal political party. This was intended to prevent the party from being taken over.

In the past, some Green Party members have been comfortable openly working with members of other political parties. For instance, GPC members [[Peter Bevan-Baker]] and [[Mike Nickerson]] worked with Liberal MP [[Joe Jordan (politician)|Joe Jordan]] to develop the [[Canada Well-Being Measurement Act]] that called upon the government to implement [[Genuine Progress Indicator]]s (GPI). While the act was introduced into the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] as a private members bill, it never became law.  A small number of Greens who advocate the more cooperative approach to legislation object to the new rule not to hold cross-memberships, a tool they occasionally employed.

== Peace and Ecology Party of Canada ==
In 2005, some members of the Green Party of Canada, who disagreed with what they considered to be the right-wing direction taken by leader [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], founded the Peace and Ecology Party of Canada.  This left-wing political party was devoted to issues such as labour, the environment, and bioregionalism.  The party was never registered with [[Elections Canada]], and did not run candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]].<ref>[http://www.peaceandecology.org/ Peace and Ecology Party Website]</ref>

== May-Dion electoral co-operation ==
With [[Stéphane Dion]] winning the Liberal leadership on a largely environmentalist platform, and both the Liberals and Greens having a shared interest in both defeating the Conservatives, whose environmental policies have come under criticism from members of both parties, some political observers questioned if an alliance of some sort between the two parties might take place.

When May made the announcement that she would run in [[Central Nova]], currently held by [[Peter MacKay]], local Liberals would "neither confirm nor deny" that they had had discussions with May over ways to unseat MacKay.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/17/may-ns.html Green party leader expected to run against MacKay<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> On March 21st, Dion said, "Madame May and I have conversations about how we may work together to be sure that this government will stop to do so much harm to our environment". The speculation was confirmed when Dion and May agreed not to run candidates in each other's ridings.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/04/12/dion-may.html Liberals agree not to run candidate against Green leader<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

May earlier attempted to broker a deal with the NDP, by contacting [[Stephen Lewis]] to set up a meeting with party leader [[Jack Layton]], who both rejected the notion outright.

There is currently no provincial Green Party ''per se'' in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The [[Terra Nova Greens]] were originally loosely affiliated with the federal party, but most supporters cut ties to the national party in 2006 (or earlier) over its opposition to [[seal hunting]]. TNG is not a registered provincial political party and seems to have been disbanded; its website has not been updated since 2000.<ref>[http://www.infonet.st-johns.nf.ca/green/index.html]</ref>
