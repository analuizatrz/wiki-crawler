'''Ian Michael Chappell''' (born [[September 26]], [[1943]] in [[Unley, South Australia]]), known as '''Chappelli''' is a former [[Australia]]n Test [[cricket]]er, who captained [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] between 1971 and 1975 before playing a central role in the breakaway [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) organisation. Born into a cricketing family, Chappell had an inconsistent career in Tests as an aggressive top order batsman until his appointment as captain. Subsequently, Chappell earned a reputation as one of the greatest captains the game has seen.<ref name=MCG>[http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=toursdisplay&articleid=119 MCG biography: Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 20 August 2007.</ref><ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/133946.html Cricinfo: An Aussie to the core.] Retrieved 30 September 2007.</ref> Following his retirement, Chappell has pursued a high-profile career as a sports journalist and commentator for [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] in Australia.

== Family and early career ==
The first of three sons born in [[Adelaide]] to Martin and Jeanne (nee Richardson), Chappell was steeped in the game from a very early age. His father was a noted Adelaide grade cricketer who put a bat in his hands as soon as he could walk, and his maternal grandfather was the famous all-round sportsman [[Vic Richardson]], who captained [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at the end of a nineteen-Test career.<ref>[http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=599&c=2573 SA Memory: Richardson, Victor York 1894&ndash;1969.] Retrieved 28 August 2007.</ref> Chappell was given weekly batting lessons from the age of five, as were younger brothers [[Greg Chappell|Greg]] and [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]], who both played for Australia. 
[[Image:Vic Richardson.jpg|125px|left|thumb|Chappell's maternal grandfather Vic Richardson]]
Chappell attended St Leonards primary school, playing his first competitive match at the age of seven. He was then enrolled at [[Prince Alfred College]], a private secondary school noted for producing many Test cricketers, including the Australian captains [[Joe Darling]] and [[Clem Hill]]. His other sporting pursuits included [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] and [[baseball]]. Chappell's performances for his state in the [[Claxton Shield]] won him All-Australian selection in 1964 and 1966 as a catcher.<ref>[http://www.waclaxtonshieldclub.baseball.com.au/default.asp?Page=7931 WA Claxton Shield club.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.</ref> At the age of 18, his form in [[South Australian Grade Cricket League|grade cricket]] for [[Glenelg Cricket Club|Glenelg]] led to a [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut for [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] (SA) against [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] in early 1962. Chappell replaced West Indian [[Garry Sobers]] who was needed for a Test match in the Caribbean.<ref>Chappell (1976), p 39.</ref>

The aggressive style of Sobers and SA captain [[Les Favell]] heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in major cricket.<ref>Chappell (1976), pp 40-41.</ref> In 1962&ndash;63, Chappell made his initial first-class century against a [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] team led by Australian captain [[Richie Benaud]]. Benaud bowled a long spell at the tyro batsman and came away impressed by his concentration and technique. Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in [[England]]'s [[Lancashire League]] with Ramsbottom<ref>[http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/display.var.1711581.0.where_are_they_now_ian_chappell.php This is Lancashire: Where are they now? Ian Chappell.]</ref> and played a single first-class match for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]].

== Test career ==
In 1963&ndash;64, Chappell batted at number three for the first time, against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] at [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|Brisbane]], scoring 205 not out.<ref name=Brayshaw>Brayshaw (1984), pp 30&ndash;33.</ref> He ended the season as the youngest member of the SA team that won the [[Pura Cup|Sheffield Shield]].<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/137958.html Cricinfo: 1963&ndash;64 Sheffield Shield winning team reunites.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.</ref> A century against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] early the following season resulted in Chappell's selection for a one-off Test against Pakistan at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] in December 1964. He made 11 and took four catches,<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/engine/match/62956.html ''Wisden, 1966 edition'': Australia v Pakistan scorecard.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref> but was dropped and did not return to the team until the fourth Ashes Test of 1965-66. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the [[Slip (cricket)|slips cordon]], and he showed promise as a [[Leg spin|leg-spinner]]. At this point, the selectors and captain [[Bob Simpson]] considered him an [[all-rounder]]<ref name=Brayshaw/> as he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match. He retained his place for the following Test, and for the tour to [[South Africa]] in the summer of 1966&ndash;67.

Playing in a side defeated 1-3, Chappell found the going tough. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each. In the first Test of 1967&ndash;68 against [[India national cricket team|India]], he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but he rode his luck to score 151. The innings contained five chances not taken by India.<ref name=Brayshaw/> However, in the remainder of the series he scored only 46 runs in four innings so his selection for the 1968 tour of [[England]] was based on potential rather than form. 

In England, Chappell rewarded the faith of the selectors by scoring the most first-class runs on tour (1,261) and leading the Australian Test aggregates with 348 runs (at 43.5 average). His top score was 81 in the fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Leeds]]. [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|''Wisden'']] lauded his back-foot play and judged him to be the most difficult Australian player to dismiss.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150223.html ''Wisden, 1969 edition'': The Australians in England 1968.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.</ref> In a summer severely affected by rain, Australia drew the series and retained [[the Ashes]].

===Inconsistent form===
A string of big scores during the 1968&ndash;69 season earned for Chappell the Australian Cricketer of the Year award. Against the touring [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], Chappell hit 177, 188 not out, 117, 180 and 165 before the New Year. Two of these centuries were made in the Tests, when Chappell's average for 548 runs was 68.5. Appointed vice-captain of the team, he was elevated to number three in the batting order, and became an occasional bowler.

Following up with a successful tour of India in late 1969, Chappell demonstrated great fluency against spin bowling by compiling Test innings of 138 at [[Feroz Shah Kotla|Delhi]] and 99 at [[Eden Gardens|Kolkata]]. His ability against both fast and slow bowling earned high praise,<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152445.html ''Wisden, 1971'': The Australians in Ceylon and India 1969&ndash;70.] Retrieved 20 August 2007.</ref> most famously from his skipper [[Bill Lawry]]. When the Australians arrived in South Africa from the sub-continent in early 1970, Lawry told the local media that Chappell was the best all-round batsman in the world. This assessment looked ridiculous at the end of the four Test series, when Chappell managed just 92 runs (at 11.5 average), with a top score of 34 as Australia lost 0-4.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/231051.html Cricinfo: When they were kings.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref>

It was on this tour that Chappell first clashed with cricket administrators over pay and conditions.<ref name=Brayshaw/> So successful was the series against South Africa that the home authorities requested that an extra Test be scheduled, to which the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control]] agreed. Incensed that the players were not consulted about the change, Chappell led a group of his teammates in a demand for more money to play the proposed game. Eventually, after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down, the extra Test was cancelled.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/143007.html Cricinfo: A tour too far.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.</ref>

===Captaincy===
At the start of the 1970&ndash;71 season, Chappell was appointed as SA captain when the long-serving [[Les Favell]] surprisingly retired. However, Chappell's main objective for the season was to maintain his place in the Test team. His younger brother Greg was scoring heavily at first-class level and made his debut in the second Test of the summer. Facing an experienced and hostile England attack, Chappell got a half-century in each of the first two Tests, but failed to go on to a big score while Greg Chappell scored 108 on his debut. Rain washed out the third Test. Chappell, temporarily promoted to open the batting, failed in the fourth Test as Australia lost. Another such performance could see him omitted from the team. In the fifth Test at Melbourne, he returned to number three and started nervously. Dropped on 0 and 14, Chappell found form and went to his maiden Ashes century (111 from 212 balls),<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150246.html ''Wisden, 1972 edition'': 5th Test Australia v England, match report.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref> which he followed up with 28 and 104 in the sixth Test.

The washed out Test had caused a change to the fixture and an unprecedented seventh Test was played at Sydney in February 1971.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154319.html ''Wisden, 1972 edition'': The MCC in Australia and New Zealand 1970&ndash;71.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref> Trailing 0&ndash;1 in the series, Australia could still retain the Ashes by winning the last Test. Australia's performances were hampered by playing slow, defensive cricket. In a radical attempt to breathe some aggression into the team, the selectors sacked captain Bill Lawry and appointed Chappell in his stead.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/272840.html Cricinfo: The end of a Victorian hero.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref> Although dismayed by the manner of Lawry's dismissed,<ref name=ABCTV>[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s720418.htm ABC TV: 7.30 Report (transcript).] Retrieved 20 August 2007.</ref> Chappell responded with an attacking performance as captain. However, Australia lost a close match by 62 runs and forfeited the Ashes for the first time in 12 years. Chappell gained some consolation at the end of a dramatic season when he led SA to the Sheffield Shield, the team's first win for seven years.

===A team in his own image===
"Chappell fashioned the Australian team in his own image in the next few years: aggressive, resourceful and insouciant".<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/4560.html Cricinfo: Ian Chappell player profile.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref> Australia lost an unofficial Test series 1-2 to a Rest of the World team that toured in 1971&ndash;72 as a replacement for the politically unacceptable South Africans. Chappell was the outstanding batsman of the summer, making four centuries in his 634 runs. He took the team to England in 1972 and was unlucky not to regain the Ashes in a rubber that ended 2&ndash;2. Greg Chappell emerged as a prolific batsman during the series, batting one place below his brother in the order. The siblings shared several crucial partnerships, most notably 201 at the Oval in the last Test when they became the first brothers to score centuries in the same Test innings.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152477.html ''Wisden, 1973 edition'': 5th Test England v Australia, match report.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref>

In 1972&ndash;73, Australia had resounding victories against Pakistan (at home) and the West Indies (away). Chappell's leadership qualities stood out in a number of tight situations. He hit his highest Test score of 196 (from 243 balls) in the first Test against Pakistan at Adelaide. 

Chappell was at his best on the indifferent pitches of the Caribbean. The highest scoring batsman of the series with 542 runs (at 77.4 average), Chappell hit two centuries and a "glorious"<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152522.html ''Wisden, 1974'': 3rd Test West Indies v Australia, match report.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref> 97 on a poor wicket in the third Test at Trinidad, batting with an injured ankle. This set up a dramatic last day when the West Indies needed just 66 runs to win with six wickets in hand at lunch. The home team collapsed against an Australian attack inspired by a brief, positive talk from Chappell during the break. Chappell's team would be the last to leave the West Indies as winners for 22 years.

===The ugly Australians===
A six-Test series against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1973&ndash;74 on both sides of the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]] brought more success and some records. In the drawn first Test at [[Basin Reserve|Wellington]], the Chappells created Test history when they both scored a century in each innings, sharing partnerships of 264 and 86. The Australians surprised by losing to the Kiwis for the first time ever, in the second Test at [[AMI Stadium|Christchurch]]. During this match, Chappell was involved in a verbal confrontation with the leading New Zealand batsman, [[Glenn Turner]].<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/extracover/content/story/142361.html Cricinfo: New Zealand's great day of fulfilment.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref> The Australians then played a very ill-tempered tour match at Dunedin, which didn't enhance the reputation of Chappell or his team, before winning the final Test at Auckland. On this tour, the behaviour of the team was often called in to question, with some journalists labelling them the "Ugly Australians".<ref name=MCG/> In his 1976 autobiography, Chappell wrote about his attitude to the opposition:<ref>Chappell (1976), p 33.</ref>
<blockquote>... although we didn't deliberately set out to be a 'bunch of bastards' when we walked on to the field, I'd much prefer any team I captained to be described like that than as 'a nice bunch of blokes on the field.' As captain of Australia my philosophy was simple: between 11.00am and 6.00pm there was no time to be a nice guy. I believed that on the field players should concentrate on giving their best to the team, to themselves and to winning; in other words, playing hard and fairly within the rules. To my mind, doing all that left no time for being a nice guy.
</blockquote>

===The Ashes regained and retirement===
[[Image:Ian Chappell graph.png|right|thumb|350px|Ian Chappell's career performance graph.]]
The highlight of Chappell's career was Australia's 4&ndash;1 win over England in 1974&ndash;75, which reclaimed the Ashes. Fortified by the new fast bowling partnership of [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Jeff Thomson]], the Australia team played hard, aggressive cricket and received criticism for the amount of [[Bouncer (cricket)|short-pitched]] bowling that was employed.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154334.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': The MCC in Australia and New Zealand 1974&ndash;75.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.</ref> Chappell top-score was 90, on an "unreliable" pitch<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153460.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': 1st Test Australia v England, match report.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.</ref> on the first day of the series, at Brisbane. He finished the six Tests with 387 runs at 35.18 average, and took 11 catches in the slips. 

Within months, Chappell was back in England leading Australia in the [[1975 Cricket World Cup|inaugural World Cup]]. His open dislike of the defensive nature of limited-over cricket led to the Australians placing a full slip cordon for the new ball. Despite the apparent unsuitability of his approach, Chappell guided his team to the final where they lost a memorable match to the West Indies.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150279.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': Prudential World Cup final, match report.]</ref> 

The workload of the captaincy was telling on Chappell and the four-Test Ashes series that followed the World Cup dampened his appetite for the game. His form remained good, and in the last Test at the Oval, he scored 192 to set up what appeared to be certain victory. However, England managed to grind out a draw and Chappell announced his resignation from the captaincy on the last day of the match.

Chappell remained available for Test cricket, and he played the 1975&ndash;76 series against the West Indies under the captaincy of his brother Greg. Australia avenged their loss in the World Cup final by winning 5-1 to claim the unofficial title as best team in the world. He incurred the ire of the administrators by wearing a pair of [[addidas]] boots with three stripes clearly visible.<ref name=Wisden76>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154504.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': Cricketer of the year &mdash; Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.</ref> Once again, Chappell demonstrated his ability in adversity by making 156 during Australia's only loss, at [[WACA Ground|Perth]] in the second Test. Always prepared to take on the Caribbean fast bowlers with the hook shot, he finished with 449 runs in the series at an average of 44.9. During the summer, Chappell passed two significant milestones when he became the fourth Australian make 5,000 runs in Test cricket and the first player to hold one hundred Test catches for Australia.

The summer ended in controversy and triumph. During a dispute with the [[SACA]] over team selection, he threatened a "strike" action by the SA team. After the matter was sorted out to his satisfaction, Chappell led the side to the Sheffield Shield title for the second time in his career. At the end of the season, he announced his retirement from first-class cricket aged only 32.

== World Series Cricket  ==
In 1976, Chappell toured South Africa with Richie Benaud's [[International cricket in South Africa (1971 to 1981)|International Wanderers]] team, released his autobiography ''Chappelli'' and was named as one of five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]].<ref name=Wisden76/> He was hired to spend the summer of 1976&ndash;77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne [[Victorian Premier Cricket|district competition]], where he was paid more than he had been as Australian captain. During the season he was involved in a famous altercation with a young English all-rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship, [[Ian Botham]]. Both men have put forward vastly different versions as to what happened during the physical confrontation in a Melbourne pub.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/extracover/content/story/279775.html Cricinfo: The feud that rumbles on.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.</ref> The animosity between them continues and it was used as a marketing ploy by [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] when Botham temporarily partnered Chappell as a television commentator during the 1998&ndash;99 season.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/76560.html Cricinfo: The Ashes &mdash; sparks set to fly between Botham and Chappell.] Retrieved 20 August 2007.</ref>
 
===Rebel skipper===
Chappell's part in the [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) schism was the result of years of personal disaffection with cricket officialdom.<ref name=ABCTV/> Approached to lead an Australian team in a proposed break-away professional competition organised by media magnate [[Kerry Packer]] for Channel Nine, Chappell provided Packer with a list of Australian players to be signed. He was a central figure in the organisation and marketing of WSC. 

Chappell played two seasons (1977-78 and 1978-79) in Australia as captain of the WSC Australian XI, enhancing his reputation against high quality opposition as both batsman and captain. In early 1979, he led a tour to the West Indies where a very hard-fought series finished in a 1-1 result, which some considered his greatest captaincy achievement.
 
===Return to Tests===
Convinced to return to official cricket when WSC ended, Chappell resumed as captain of SA in 1979&ndash;80. It was a season too far for the increasingly irascible Chappell. In a match against Tasmania, he was reported for swearing and suspended for three matches. He was controversially selected for Australia mid-season,<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153581.html ''Wisden, 1981 edition'': 2nd Test Australia v England, match report.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.</ref> and his Test career finished when he with scores of 75 and 26 not out at the MCG against England in February 1980.

===ODI matches===
Chappell’s aggressive approach to batting and his experience against the new ball made him an ideal [[Limited overs cricket|limited-overs]] player: he scored his runs at a strike-rate of 77. Although the timing of his career limited him to 16 [[One-Day International|ODI]] matches, Chappell appeared in a number of historic games such as the first ODI (at the MCG in 1971),<ref>[http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1970-71/ENG_IN_AUS/ENG_AUS_ODI_05JAN1971.html Cricinfo: Only ODI Australia v England, scorecard] Retrieved 30 September 2007.</ref> the first World Cup final (at Lord’s in 1975) and the first day/night match (during WSC, at [[Waverley Park|VFL Park]] in 1978).<ref>[http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1977-78/OTHERS+ICC/PACKER/INT-CUP/WSC-AUS_WSC-WI_INT-CUP_24JAN1978.html Cricinfo: International Cup match 13 WSC Australia v WSC West Indies, scorecard.] Retrieved 30 September 2007.</ref> He passed fifty in 50% of his innings with a top score of 86 at Christchurch in 1973&ndash;74. In his final season in international cricket, he scored 63 not out (from 65 balls) against the West Indies at the SCG to win the player of the match award; five days later he hit an unbeaten 60 from 50 balls in his penultimate ODI appearance, against England. As captain, he recorded six wins and five losses from 11 matches.

===Legacy===
[[Image:Adelaide Oval 2006-2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Ian and Greg Chappell stands at the Adelaide Oval, opened in 2003]]
"Chappell will be remembered as much for his bid to improve the players' lot as he will for his run-getting and captaincy".<ref name=Wisden76/> During the WSC period, Chappell founded a players association with a loan provided by Kerry Packer. Despite Chappell's continued support after his retirement, apathy led to its' demise in 1988. Eventually, it was revived in 1997 as the [[Australian Cricketers' Association]] and has become an influential organisation in Australian cricket. In 2005, Chappell became a member of its' executive.<ref>[http://www.auscricket.com.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?id=233&nav_cat_id=223&nav_top_id=64&dsb=819 Australian Cricketers' Association: Media release 28 September 2005.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.</ref>

In July 2000, Chappell was inducted into the [[Federation of International Cricketers' Associations|FICA]] Cricket Hall of Fame<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/88992.html Cricinfo: Cricket's Hall of Fame welcomes five new members.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.</ref> and the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] in 2003. The same year, two new grandstands at the Adelaide Oval were named after Ian and his brother Greg. At the dedication ceremony for the stands, the SACA president [[Ian McLachlan]] called the Chappells, "the most famous cricketing family in South Australia".<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/125679.html Cricinfo: Chappell brothers and Clem Hill honoured at Adelaide Oval.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.</ref>

== Media career ==
Chappell began working as a commentator for Channel Nine's cricket coverage in the 1980&ndash;81 season, a position he retains. The major controversy of his first season was the "Underarm Incident" which involved his two younger brothers in an ODI played between Australia and New Zealand at the MCG. Chappell showed no fraternal bias and was vehement in his criticism of the tactic. He wrote in a newspaper column on the matter: "Fair dinkum, Greg, how much pride do you sacrifice to win $35,000?"<ref>McGregor (1985), p 209.</ref>

In 2006, Chappell released an anthology of his cricket writings entitled ''A Golden Age''.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/ian-chappell-no-aggro-or-ego----just-the-bloody-brutal-truth/2006/09/23/1158431951681.html ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 24 September 2006.]</ref>

== Private Life ==
After leaving school, Chappell spent two years as a clerk in sharebroker's office which ended when he went to play league cricket in England. He then worked as a promotions representative for Nestle and the cigarette manufacturer WD & HO Wills. After eight years with Wills, Chappell capitalised on his fame as Australian captain by forming his own company specialising in advertising, promotion and journalism, which has remained his profession. He is twice married, and has a daughter Amanda with his first wife Kay. Chappell now lives in Sydney with second wife Barbara.
