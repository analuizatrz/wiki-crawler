'''Robert McCartney''' ([[1971]] &ndash; [[31 January]] [[2005]]) was the victim of a murder in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], allegedly carried out by members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. He was a father of two small children and was engaged to be married in June 2005 to his long-term partner, Bridgeen Hagans. He was a [[Catholic]] and lived in the predominantly [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Short Strand]] area of [[East Belfast]] and was said by some to be a supporter of [[Sinn Féin]].<ref name="TRIBUNE">{{cite news

==The fight==
Robert McCartney was involved in an altercation in a bar &mdash; ''Magennis's'' &mdash; on May Street, in the centre of [[Belfast]], on the night of [[30 January]], [[2005]]. He was found unconscious with stab wounds in Cromac Street and died in hospital the following morning. He was 33 years old.<ref name="BBC-1">{{cite news

The fight arose when his friend, Brendan Devine, was accused of making an insulting gesture or comment to a woman in the Co bar. When Devine refused to accept this or apologise, a brawl began. He was then dragged into Verner Street, beaten and stabbed. Devine also suffered a knife attack, but survived. In June 2005, Brendan Devine was sentenced to seven years in prison for taking part in a robbery on the outskirts of [[Belfast]]. <ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4620391.stm BBC: McCartney friend jailed over raid]</ref>

==Investigation==
When the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) launched a murder investigation they were met with a "wall of silence"; none of the estimated 72 witnesses to the altercation came forward with information. This is not an unusual attitude among Irish nationalists, who have mixed views of the new police force. In conversations with family members, many potential witnesses claimed to have been in the pub's toilets at the time of the attacks; this led to the toilets being dubbed the [[TARDIS]], after the [[Time travel|time machine]] in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which is much bigger on the inside than on the outside.<ref>{{cite news

Sinn Féin claimed that the investigation was being used as an excuse to disrupt the community and accused the PSNI of heavy-handedness. Over a thousand people attended a vigil in memory of McCartney five days after his murder. A similar number attended his funeral.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

The IRA expelled three members some weeks later. [[Mark Durkan]] of the moderate [[Irish nationalism|Nationalist]] [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) also accused the IRA of orchestrating a cover-up,{{Fact|date=January 2008}} claiming that the "full force of the IRA has been used to intimidate witnesses and prevent the killers from being brought to justice."{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

==Political fallout==
[[Gerry Adams]], President of Sinn Féin, urged witnesses to come forward to "the family, a solicitor, or any other authoritative or reputable person or body".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4263359.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Adams in appeal to catch killers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Adams continued, "I want to make it absolutely clear that no one involved acted as a republican or on behalf of republicans."  He suspended seven members of Sinn Féin. Adams stopped short of asking witnesses to contact the police directly, unsurprising in light of Sinn Féin's historic lack of confidence in the police in Northern Ireland, whether it be the PSNI or its predecessor the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC). The usefulness of making witness statements to the victim's family or to a solicitor was derided by the McCartneys and by a prominent lawyer and SDLP politician, [[Alban Maginness]], soon afterwards.<ref>[http://www.sdlparchive.com/prmaginuessagreeswithmccartneyfamily.shtm Maginness Agrees With Mccartney Family After Us Consul Meeting<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

On [[February 16]] the IRA issued a statement denying involvement in the murder and calling on the perpetrators to "take responsibility".<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/ira160205.htm CAIN: Events: Peace: Irish Republican Army (IRA) statement about the killing of Robert McCartney, (16 February 2005)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On [[March 8]] the IRA issued an unprecedented statement saying that four people were directly involved in the murder, that the IRA knew their identity, that two were IRA volunteers, and that the IRA had made an offer to McCartney's family to shoot the people directly involved in the murder.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,1433163,00.html Full text of IRA statement | Special reports | Guardian Unlimited<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

All five McCartney sisters and his partner, Bridgeen Hagans, expressly rejected the IRA's offer to shoot the men, and again asked that the IRA lift their threats against witnesses to McCartney's murder, allowing them to testify to the PSNI. Their cousin, Gerry Quinn, stated that McCartney's family wanted ''"justice, not revenge."''{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Since this time, the sisters of Robert McCartney have maintained an increasingly public campaign for justice (through the legal process) which saw [[Martin McGuinness]] make a public pronouncement that the sisters should be careful that they were not being manipulated for political ends.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4349183.stm BBC</ref>

The McCartney family travelled to the United States during the 2005 [[St Patrick's Day]] celebrations where they were met by US Senators (including [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[John McCain]]) and US President [[George W. Bush]] who expressed support in their campaign for justice.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4359491.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Family encouraged by Bush talks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Meanwhile Gerry Adams was noticeably shunned by senior US politicians, especially Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], who had previously welcomed Adams in an attempt to assist the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]] in Northern Ireland.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

In December, the McCartney sisters met with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, and told him they believed the murder had been ordered by a senior IRA member, and that Sinn Féinn were still not doing all they could to help them.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4551468.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | McCartney 'killer plans US move'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On 31 January 2007, two years after the murder, and in line with the Party's new policy of supporting civil policing, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said that anyone with information about the murder should go to the police.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6317565.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Adams backs PSNI McCartney probe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Criminal charges ==

On  [[May 5]] 2005, Terence Davison and James McCormick were remanded in custody, charged with murdering McCartney and attempting to murder Devine respectively.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4609435.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Two remanded in McCartney killing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> McCormick is originally from [[England]]. They were held in the Republican wing of Maghaberry prison.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2005/08/25/for_6_belfast_women_ira_battle_isnt_over/?page=full For 6 Belfast women, IRA battle isn't over - The Boston Globe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Roughly four months later the accused were released on bail,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4207992.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | McCartney accused freed on bail<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and in June 2006, the attempted murder charge against McCormick was dropped, leaving a charge of causing an affray.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5134894.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Attempted murder charge dropped<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Driven out by intimidation ==

The McCartney family had lived in the Short Strand area of Belfast for five generations.  However some local people in the Short Strand area, which is a largely Nationalist area, did not welcome their dispute with the IRA and allegedly drove them to leave by threats of violence.  The last McCartney sister to leave the area (Paula) departed Short Strand on [[26 October]] [[2005]] <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,1570064,00.html The Guardian : Republican crowd pickets  McCartney home]</ref>.  

In November 2005, the McCartney sisters and Bridgeen Hagans, the former partner of Robert McCartney, refused to accept the Outstanding achievement award at The Women of the Year Awards, because it would have meant their sharing a platform with [[Margaret Thatcher]], traditionally a hate figure in the [[Irish republican]] community.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,1627493,00.html The Guardian : McCartney sisters refuse award because of Thatcher]</ref>.
