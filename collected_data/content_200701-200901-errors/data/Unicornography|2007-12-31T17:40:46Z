'''''Unicornography''''' is the critically acclaimed<ref name="All music guide album review">{{cite web | title=All Music Guide, Unicornography Review | work=AMG Profile | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:wcfrxqrdldke | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref><ref name="PunkNews.org album review">{{cite web | title=PunkNews, Unicornography Review | work=Review | url=http://www.punknews.org/review/5671 | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref> debut album by the [[Chicago]]-based [[punk rock]] [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] [[The Falcon (band)|The Falcon]] which was released on [[September 26]], [[2006]] in the [[United States]]. The album contains many of the elements found on modern day [[rock (music)|rock]] and [[punk (music)|punk]] releases, as well as using new musical styles such as blending punk rock with [[Ska]].<ref name="PunkNews.org album review">{{cite web | title=PunkNews, Unicornography Review | work=Review | url=http://www.punknews.org/review/5671 | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref>

The [[guitar]] on the album was supposed to be played by former [[Guitarist]] of [[Rise Against]], [[Todd Mohney]]. He was the guitarist on the EP but he could not attend the recording session for Unicornography due to other commitments <ref name="ThePunkSite.com Interview with Brendan Kelly">{{cite web | title=ThePunkSite.com Interview with Brendan Kelly | work=PunkSite Interview | url=http://www.thepunksite.com/interviews.php?page=lawrencearms | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref>. Band members [[Brendan Kelly (musician)|Brendan Kelly]] and drummer [[Neil Hennessy]] took over Mohney's role on the album.

==Critical reception==

The album got favourable [[review]]s from many sites with [[All Music Guide]] describing the band as "experts at fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants punk -- it takes skill to make music this great seem so easy to do." <ref name="All music guide album review">{{cite web | title=All Music Guide, Unicornography Review | work=AMG Profile | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:wcfrxqrdldke | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref>

[[Punknews.org]] went as far as saying "Sometimes hype is justified, as the Falcon have clearly proven. Maybe the ultimate "feel-good" album of 2006." <ref name="PunkNews.org album review">{{cite web | title=PunkNews, Unicornography Review | work=Review | url=http://www.punknews.org/review/5671 | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref> Meanwhile some reviews are a bit more scathing, [[Aversion.com]] said "With the departure of Rise Against guitarist Todd Mahoney from the lineup, The Falcon comes off sounding more like [[The Lawrence Arms]]' kid brother instead of a stand-alone act"
