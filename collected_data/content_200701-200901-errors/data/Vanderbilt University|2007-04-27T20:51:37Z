'''Vanderbilt University''' is a [[private university|private]], nonsectarian, [[co-education|coeducational]] [[research university]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

Vanderbilt was founded in [[1873]] with a gift of $1 million from [[ship transport|shipping]] and [[rail transport|rail]] magnate [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] who, despite having never been to the South, hoped his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  

Today, Vanderbilt enrolls around 11,000 students in ten schools&mdash;four undergraduate and six graduate and professional. Also affiliated with the university are several research facilities and a world-renowned medical center, the [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] (VUMC), which is the only [[Level I Trauma Center]] in Middle Tennessee.  

Vanderbilt is a member of the [[Association of American Universities]], to whose membership it was elected in 1950.

==History==
[[Image:Vanderbilt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cornelius Vanderbilt]]

In the years prior to the American [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]] had been considering creating a regional university for the training of ministers located centrally for the congregations of the church. Through the lobbying of Nashville bishop [[Holland Nimmons McTyeire|Holland McTyeire]], church leaders voted in 1872 to create "Central University" in Nashville. However, lack of funds (and the war-ravaged state of the South) delayed the opening of the college. 

The following year, on a medical trip to [[New York, New York|New York]], McTyeire stayed at the residence of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt|"Commodore" Cornelius Vanderbilt]], whose second wife was the cousin of McTyeire's wife.  Vanderbilt, the wealthiest man in America at the time, had been considering philanthropic causes as he was at an advanced age. His original plan was to establish a university on [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in honor of his mother. McTyeire, however, successfully convinced him to donate $500,000 to endow Central University.  

The endowment (later increased to $1 million) would be Vanderbilt's only philanthropy.  Though the Commodore never expressed any desire to have the university named after himself, McTyeire and his fellow trustees soon rechristened the school as "the Vanderbilt University."  Vanderbilt died in 1877 having never even visited the school named after him.

[[Image:Vandy Old Main.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Old Main (1875), photographed before it burned in 1905]][[Image:Vandy-Kirkland-2.jpg|thumb|left|175px|After the fire, Old Main was rebuilt with one tower and renamed Kirkland Hall.  It is currently home of Vanderbilt's administration.]]  In the fall of 1875, about 200 students enrolled at Vanderbilt; the university was dedicated in October of that year.  Bishop McTyeire, who had been named chairman of the Board of Trust for life by Vanderbilt as a stipulation of his endowment, named [[Landon Garland]], his mentor from [[Randolph-Macon College]] in [[Virginia]] and then-[[chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Mississippi]], as chancellor. Garland shaped the school's structure and hired the school's faculty, many of whom were renowned scholars in their respective fields. However, most of this crop of star faculty left after disputes with Bishop McTyeire.

[[Image:HPIM0343b.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Old Science Hall (recently renamed Benson Science Hall), one of the original buildings, has not been used for science classes in many years.]]For the first 40 years, the Board of Trust (and therefore the university itself) was under the control of the general conference (the governing body) of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]]. However, tensions began rising between the university administration and the Conference over the future of the school, particularly over the methods by which members of the Vanderbilt Board of Trust would be chosen.  

Conflicts escalated with the appointment of James Kirkland as chancellor in 1893.  The final straw, at least in the mind of Kirkland, was a failed campaign to raise $300,000 from Southern Methodist congregations (only $50,000 was raised).  Further disputes between the bishops and Kirkland, which erupted into litigation in 1912, led the Methodist conference to sever all ties with Vanderbilt University in June 1914.

Vanderbilt enjoyed early intellectual influence during the 1920s and 1930s when it hosted two partly overlapping groups of scholars who had a large impact on American thought and letters: the ''[[Fugitives]]'' and the ''[[Southern Agrarians|Agrarians]].''  During the same period, [[Ernest William Goodpasture]] and his colleagues in the Medical School invented methods for cultivating [[viruses]] and [[rickettsiae]] in fertilized chicken eggs. This work made possible the production of vaccines against [[chicken pox]], [[smallpox]], [[yellow fever]], [[typhus]], [[Rocky mountain spotted fever]] and other diseases caused by agents that only propagate in living cells.

[[Image:Vandy-Kissam Hall.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Kissam Hall, men's dormitory from 1901 until it was razed in 1958.  The baths were all in the basement.]]

In the late 1950s, the [[Vanderbilt Divinity School]] became something of a hotbed of the emerging Civil Rights movement, and the university expelled one of its leaders, [[James Lawson]].  Much later, in 2005, he was made a Distinguished Alumnus for his achievements and re-hired as a Distinguished University Professor for the 2006-07 academic year.[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/register/articles?id=24339]

As with Lawson, the university drew national attention in 1966, when it recruited the first African American athlete in the Southeastern Conference, [http://www.tshf.net/inductees/2003Wallace.htm Perry Wallace].  Wallace, from Nashville, played varsity basketball for Vanderbilt from 1967-1970, and faced considerable opposition from segregationists when playing at other SEC venues.  In  2004, a student-led drive to have Wallace's jersey retired finally succeeded. [[Harold Vanderbilt]] was president of the Board of Trust between 1955 and 1968 when [[racial integration]] was a very prominent topic at the school. Today a statue of him in front of Buttrick Hall memorializes his efforts. 

In 1966, Oberlin Graduate School of Theology moved from Ohio to Nashville, in order to merge with the [[Vanderbilt Divinity School]]. In 1979, Vanderbilt absorbed its neighbor [[Peabody College]].

[[Image:vandyconfederatehall.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Memorial Hall, located on the Peabody campus, was the subject of a lawsuit to remove the word "Confederate" from its facade.]]

History, race, and civil rights issues again came to the fore on the campus in 2002, when the university decided to rename a dormitory on the Peabody campus, Confederate Memorial Hall, to Memorial Hall. Nationwide attention resulted, in part due to a lawsuit by the Tennessee chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]], who had helped pay for the building's construction in 1933 with a $50,000 contribution.

The Davidson County Chancery Court dismissed the lawsuit in 2003, but the Tennessee Court of Appeals ruled in May 2005 that the university would have to pay damages based on the present value of the United Daughters of the Confederacy's contribution if an inscription bearing the name "Confederate Memorial Hall" were to be removed from the building or altered.  

In late July of 2005, the university announced that although it has officially renamed the building and all university publications and offices will refer to it solely as "Memorial Hall," the university would neither appeal the matter further nor remove the inscription and pay damages.

==Organization==
===Board of Trust===
Vanderbilt University, as a private corporation, is wholly governed by an independent, self-perpetuating Board of Trust. The Board is comprised of 45 regular members (plus any number of trustees emeriti) and the Chancellor. Each trustee serves a five-year term (except for four recently-graduated undergraduates, who serve four-year terms). A complete, up-to-date listing of the members of the Board of Trust can be found [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/ here]. [[Martha Rivers Ingram]] is the current [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board of Trust]].

===Chancellor===
[[Gordon Gee]] is the current [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of Vanderbilt University. Appointed by the Board of Trust, he is the [[Chief Executive Officer|chief executive officer]] of the university, and serves only at the pleasure of the Board. Prior to his appointment in February 2000, Gordon Gee served as president of [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]].

Since the opening of the university in 1875, only seven individuals have served as chancellor[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/chancellor/history.html]:

==Students and faculty==
[[Image:Gordon gee.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Gordon Gee, Chancellor of Vanderbilt University]]
As of fall 2005, the last semester for which comprehensive data have been published, the university had an enrollment of 6,402 undergraduate and 5,079 graduate and professional students. Approximately 52% of the total student body comes from outside the Southeast, including some 2% from outside the United States. Moreover, 20% of the undergraduate class of 2010 were non-Caucasian.
			
With nearly 20,000 employees, Vanderbilt is the largest private employer in Middle Tennessee and the second largest in the state (after [[FedEx]], headquartered in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]). The vast majority of those employees are staff at the Medical Center (see below). Of the 2,527 full-time faculty employed by the university, 1,625 are Medical Center faculty (specifically the Schools of Medicine and Nursing) and 902 are University Central (non-Medical Center) faculty.

In 2004, the university reported that 24.1% of University Central faculty were women, while 14.4% were of a racial or ethnic minority.  In 2003, seventeen were members of one of the [[United States National Academies|National Academies]].

==Campus==
The Vanderbilt campus is located approximately 1.5 [[mile]]s (2.4 [[kilometre|km]]) west of downtown in the West End neighborhood of midtown [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. It has an area of 330 [[acre]]s (1.3 km²), though this figure includes large tracts of sparsely used land in the southwest part of the main campus, as well as the Medical Center.  The historical core of campus encompasses approximately 30 acres (12 ha). Vanderbilt is located at {{coor dms|36|08|45|N|86|48|05|W|}}.

===Layout===
[[Image:Vanderbiltsign.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Corner of 21st and West End]]
[[Image:Vandybicentennialtree.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bicentennial Oak, facing Buttrick Hall]]
[[Image:vandystephensoncenter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stevenson Center, as seen from Buttrick Hall]]
The Vanderbilt campus is roughly fan-shaped (with the point at the corner of West End and 21st Avenues) and divisible into six sections, all of which are within walking distance from one another: the furthest distance on campus take about twenty-five minutes to walk. 

'''Original campus'''

In the northeast corner of the campus (the "base" of the fan) is the original campus. The first college buildings, including Kirkland Hall, were erected here in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. This section stretches from West End Avenue south to the Stevenson Center and west from 21st Avenue to Alumni Lawn. 

The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments of the College of Arts and Science, as well as the facilities of the [[Vanderbilt University Law School|Law School]], [[Owen Graduate School of Management]], and the Divinity School, are located in the original campus. Additionally, the Central Library (known to alumni as the JUL, or Joint University Library) and Sarratt Student Center/Rand Hall can be found on the original campus.

'''Stevenson Center'''

Flanking the original campus to the south are the Stevenson Center for Science and Mathematics and the School of Engineering complex (Jacobs Hall-Featheringill Hall).  Housing the Science Library, the School of Engineering, and all the science and math departments of the College of Arts and Science, save for psychology, this complex sits between the original campus and the Medical Center.

'''Medical center campus'''

The Vanderbilt University Medical Center itself takes up the southeastern part of the campus. Besides the various associated hospitals and clinics and the facilities of the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, the medical center also houses many major research facilities. 

'''Peabody campus'''

Directly across 21st Avenue from the Medical Center sits the campus of the Peabody College of Education and Human Development. Due to their separate histories until the merger, the Peabody campus was configured in a radically different style than the original Vanderbilt campus. Whereas the latter has an unplanned organic design with buildings scattered throughout, Peabody campus was planned as a geometric design, similar to the [[Thomas Jefferson|Jeffersonian]] style of the [[University of Virginia]].  The campus is home to not only Peabody College but also the future Commons, where all freshmen will live together as part of the College Halls plan (see [[Vanderbilt University#College halls|College Halls]], below).

'''Central campus and Greek row'''

West of the original campus and the Medical Center, Greek Row and the bulk of Vanderbilt residence halls are found.  From north to south, Carmichael Towers, Greek Row, Branscomb Quadrangle, and Highland Quadrangle house the vast majority of on-campus residents in facilities ranging from the double-occupancy shared-bathroom dorms in Branscomb and Towers to the apartments and lodges in Highland Quad.  

This part of campus is newer than the others; Vanderbilt's westward growth did not start until the 1950s. This portion of campus was built by tearing down small single family houses and duplexes dating from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and so the area has significantly less green space than the arboretum on the original campus and is more indicative of the university's urban locale.

'''Athletics and recreation facilities'''

[[Memorial Gymnasium (Vanderbilt University)|Memorial Gymnasium]], [[Vanderbilt Stadium]], [[Hawkins Field]], [[McGugin Center]], and all the other varsity athletic fields and facilities are to be found in the extreme west of campus.  The Student Recreation Center, and its associated intramural fields, are located south of the varsity facilities

===Arboretum===
[[Image:Vandyarboretum.jpg|thumb|right|150px|National Arboretum Plaque.]]
The oldest part of the Vanderbilt campus is known for its abundance of trees and green space, which stand in contrast to the surrounding cityscape of urban Nashville. At least one specimen of every tree that is indigenous to the state of Tennessee grows on campus. 

One tree, the Bicentennial Oak between Rand Hall and Garland Hall, is certified to have lived during the [[American Revolution]] and is the oldest thing on the campus.  

The main (original) campus was designated by the Association of Botanical Gardens and Aboreta as a national [[arboretum]] in 1988, a status that the university does not take lightly. One interesting consequence of this designation that any visitor to the campus will quickly notice is the length to which trees on campus are protected.  Signs posted on the trees by various student groups are actually bound to the trees with wire instead of being nailed to the tree, as it is unlawful to cause damage to any tree in a national arboretum.

==Student life==
[[Image:Homecoming Regatta 2.sized.jpg|thumb|right|Sailing Club Regatta]] 
===Organizations===
The university recognizes nearly 400 student organizations, ranging from academic major societies and honoraries to recreational sports clubs, the oldest of which is the [[Vanderbilt Sailing Club]].  

There are religious groups like the Baptist Collegiate Ministries, Hillel, [[Reformed University Fellowship]], [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], Wesleyan/Canterbury Fellowship, and Vanderbilt Catholic Community.

The campus radio station, [[WRVU]], represents the student body by playing a range of music from bluegrass to choral, with a focus on non-mainstream music.[http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/3976] 

The campus television station, Vanderbilt Television (VTV), showcases student produced films, skits, and news and entertainment-based shows. 

There are also more than thirty service organizations on campus, giving students the opportunity to perform community service across the country and around the world, including the Vanderbilt-founded [[Alternative Spring Break]].

===Greek life===
[[Image:Vanderbilt Homecoming 2003.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Vanderbilt's Homecoming Queen and King have consistently been members of Greek organizations; in 2003, [[Kappa Delta]] and [[Beta Upsilon Chi]] won.]] Greeks dominate the social scene on and off campus. As of spring 2004, 45% of the undergraduate student body was affiliated with one of 34 [[Fraternities and sororities|social Greek]] organizations.  Specifically, 34% of men were members of fraternities and 55% of women were members of sororities.  More recently, several new chapters have been colonized at Vanderbilt, demonstrating the continued demand for available memberships.

The local chapters are supported by active alumni bases that continue to involve former active members in both the life of the social organization and the life of the university.  Many members of Vanderbilt's Board of Trust were members of Greek organizations.

====Fraternities====
National fraternities recognized by the Office of the Dean of Students include:

In addition to the officially recognized fraternities and sororities, the [[Nu Society]] (an off-campus organization established by former members of Vanderbilt's chapter of Sigma Nu after that chapter lost its charter) maintains an active off-campus presence. In addition, an independent fraternity, PSK (Pages, Squires, Knights), existed between 1965 and 1975.[http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/speccol/archives/archives/700.pdf]

The sororities represented on campus are:

===Honor Code===
Since the first classes began at Vanderbilt, the Honor System has served to strengthen the academic integrity of the university.  Its principles were outlined in a famous quote by long-time Dean of Students Madison Sarratt[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/HonorCouncil/honorquo.php]:{{quote|Today I am going to give you two examinations, one in trigonometry and one in honesty. I hope you will pass them both, but if you must fail one, let it be trigonometry, for there are many good [people] in this world today who cannot pass an examination in trigonometry, but there are no good [people] in the world who cannot pass an examination in honesty.}}

As a part of their first act together as a class, each Vanderbilt class meets together at the Honor Code Signing Ceremony, where every member of the class pledges their honor and signs the code.  The signature pages are then hung in the Student Center.  The ceremony is one of only two occasions where a class will be congregated in a single place at the same time (the other being Commencement).

The Undergraduate Honor Council was formed to help enforce and protect the tradition of the Honor Code. Today, the Honor Council serves two simultaneous aims: to enforce and protect the Honor Code and to inform members of the Vanderbilt community about the Honor System.

===Student housing===
All undergraduate students not living with relatives in [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] are required to live on campus all four years to the extent that on-campus student housing facilities can accommodate them. In practice, though, approximately 83% of undergraduates&mdash;freshmen, sophomores, nearly all juniors and most seniors&mdash;currently live on campus.  The remaining undergraduates join graduate and professional students in living off-campus. Student life at Vanderbilt is consequently heavily intertwined with campus life.

However, the on-campus residential system is currently undergoing a radical change.  The new system, announced by the administration in [[2002]], would change the current structure of quadrangle-based residence halls to a new system of [[residential college]]s, to be called ''College Halls''. Similar to the residential structures at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Rice University|Rice]], and [[Yale University|Yale]], the new College Halls system would create residence halls where students and faculty would live together in a self-sustaining environment, complete with study rooms, cafeterias, laundry facilities, and stores. This project is now underway and is scheduled to be completed within the next twenty years.  

The first step in the College Halls system will be The Commons, a collection of ten residential halls on the Peabody campus that will house all first-year students beginning in the fall of 2008.  While the university currently houses freshmen in three separate and distinct residential areas, it is hoped that The Commons will give first-year students a unified (and unifying) living-learning experience.  In order to accommodate these ten residential halls, the university is in the process of renovating five existing Peabody dormitories and building five new ones.

With the addition of these new residence halls, the university will be able to house all undergraduate students on campus. Since university policy requires undergraduates to live on campus when possible, Vanderbilt's Office of Housing and Residential Education will no longer grant students permission to live off campus, beginning with the class graduating in 2009.[http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/2543]  Many current students who came to Vanderbilt with the understanding that seniors were generally allowed to live off campus are now disappointed that they must live on campus all four years.[http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/3627]  However, university administrators believe the undergraduate community receives the greatest benefit from living in on-campus residence halls, citing increased interaction with faculty, better academic performance, and stronger interpersonal relationships.[http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/2543]

==Media==
[[Image:geedead.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chancellor Gee holding ''The Slant'''s hoax issue (posing as the "Huslter") reporting his death]]

The Vanderbilt community produces media of all genres and in all formats at a prolific rate by students, alumni, and faculty alike.  

The ''Vanderbilt Register'' is the official newspaper of the university administration and faculty.  Published once every two weeks, it does not publish opinion.

''Exploration'' is the university's online research magazine. It publishes multimedia stories that explain campus research projects ranging from archeology to zoology, probe the motives that drive the modern-day explorers that perform these studies and describe the experiences of Vanderbilt students who become involved in actual scientific research.

In spite of the lack of an organized journalism curriculum, no less than nine editorially-independent media outlets are produced and controlled by students.  Seven print publications, a broadcast radio station and a closed-circuit television station provide a forum for student opinion and issues.  One publication, ''The Vanderbilt Hustler'', was established in 1888 and is the oldest continuously published newspaper in [[Nashville]] (the newspaper's name supposedly references another nickname for the Commodore based on his cutthroat business practices, ''i.e.'', that he "hustled" people out of their money). These student media divisions are organized and controlled by Vanderbilt Student Communications, Inc.  In addition, students at the [[Vanderbilt University Law School]] publish three [[law review]]s; the flagship journal is the ''[[Vanderbilt Law Review]]''.

Alumni produce fourteen publications, one for each school and one overall alumni publication: ''Vanderbilt Magazine''.  In addition, an electronic newsletter, ''.commodore'', is produced.

==Medical Center==
[[Image:vandymedschoolquad.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Entrance to the Vanderbilt School of Medicine]]
The [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] is a vital component of the university and comprises:

* Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH)
* The Monroe Carell, Jr., Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt
* Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital
* Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Hospital
* The Vanderbilt Clinic
* Vanderbilt University School of Medicine
* Vanderbilt University School of Nursing

In 2003, the medical center was placed on the Honor Roll of ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'''s annual rating of the nation's best hospitals, placing it alongside other well-known medical centers, such as the [[Cleveland Clinic]] and the [[Duke University|Duke University Medical Center]].

==Admissions and Rankings==
Vanderbilt is a highly selective institution.  In 2006, it accepted 34% of its undergraduate applicants. ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' gave Vanderbilt a selectivity rating of 97 out of 100 in its 2006 edition.[http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/generalinfomore.asp?listing=1022817&ltid=1&intbucketid=]

In its [[2007]] edition, ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' placed Vanderbilt at 18th in its ranking of national universities.[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1natudoc_brief.php] In the same publication's 2007 graduate program rankings, Peabody College was listed at 3rd among schools of education, the Vanderbilt Law School was listed at 16th, the School of Medicine was listed at 18th among research-oriented [[medical school]]s, the School of Nursing was listed at 19th, and the Owen Graduate School of Management was listed at 34th among business schools.[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/rankindex_brief.php] Additionally, Vanderbilt is ranked 1st in the nation in the fields of [[special education]][http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/edu/brief/edusp07_brief.php] and [[audiology]][http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/reporter/index.html?ID=5442].

In ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]] [[2006]]'', Vanderbilt is ranked 26th in North America and 53rd worldwide.[http://www.fc.ethz.ch/facts/inst_research/thes/THES_World_University_Rankings_2006.pdf] The 2007 [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]], a measure of the scholarly output of the faculty of nearly 7,300 doctoral programs around the United States, ranked Vanderbilt 8th among large research universities, and 1st in the areas of [[comparative literature]], [[educational leadership]], [[pharmacology]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[special education]].[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i19/19a00801.htm]

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' ranked Owen 2nd among "smaller" business schools in 2004.[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/news/releases/2004/9/22/owen_school_ranked_no._2_among_smaller_schools_by_wall_street_journal]

==Unusual Research==
As with any large research institution, Vanderbilt investigators work in a broad range of disciplines. However, among its more unusual activities, the university has institutes devoted to the study of coffee and of [[contract bridge|bridge]]. Indeed, the modern form of the latter was developed by [[Harold Stirling Vanderbilt]], a former president of the university's Board of Trust and a great-grandson of the Commodore. In addition, in mid-2004 it was announced that Vanderbilt's [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/news/science_video?id=24678 chemical biology research] may have serendipitously opened the door to the breeding of a [[blue rose]], something that had long been coveted by [[horticulture|horticulturalists]] and rose lovers.

Vanderbilt's research record is blemished, however, by a study the university conducted on the effects of [[iron]] [[metabolism]] during [[pregnancy]] in the 1940s.  Between [[1945]] and [[1949]], approximately 800 pregnant women were given without their knowledge an injection of [[radioactive]] iron.  The injections were later suspected to be the cause of death for some of the children who were being carried ''[[in utero]]'' at the time.[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E0D8153AF931A35750C0A962958260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=1]  In 1998, the university settled a [[class action lawsuit]] with the mothers and surviving children for $10.3 million.[http://www.lieffcabraser.com/vanderbilt.htm]

==Myths==

Vanderbilt's long history has given birth to several myths and urban legends. Some of the more well known[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/admissions/randomTraditions.php]:

* Furman Hall, the single stone building amongst the brick buildings of the old campus was built because an architect who was designing buildings for both [[Duke University]] and Vanderbilt at the same time became confused.  (In reality, though Furman Hall’s grey stone composition is in sharp contrast to adjacent brick buildings, Furman and its surrounding buildings were not built in the same eras.)

* The administration at Vanderbilt has canceled classes only twice, once because of a loose bull on campus.  (Vanderbilt has canceled classes many times over its history, but not because of a loose bull.)

* There is no bell at the top of Kirkland Hall, just a stereo system that imitates chimes.  (After Kirkland Hall burned in 1905, Nashville schoolchildren collected money for a new 2,000-pound bell, which still chimes on the hour from Kirkland Tower.)

* The teacher in ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'' is based on Vanderbilt professor John Lachs.  (The film's screenplay was written by Tom Schulman, who is a Vanderbilt alumnus, but he based the story on his experiences at a Nashville prep school.)

==Athletics==
{{See also|Vanderbilt Commodores football}}
{{See also|Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball}}
Vanderbilt fields teams in sixteen varsity sports, six men's and ten women's. Men's and women's [[tennis]] and men's and women's [[basketball]] are traditionally the school's strongest sports, with the more recently founded women's [[lacrosse]] and [[bowling]] programs as well as the long-standing men's [[baseball]] program experiencing moderate national success.   After enjoying success in the first half of the 20th century, the [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|football program]] has struggled in more recent times.   

The school is a charter member of the [[Southeastern Conference]], in which it is the only private school, in [[Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Additionally, the school is a member of the [[American Lacrosse Conference]] ([[women's lacrosse]]), as the SEC does not sponsor that sport.  Conversely, Vanderbilt is the only league school not to field teams in [[softball]] and [[volleyball]], two women's sports that are sponsored by the SEC.

The baseball team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004 and had the nation's top recruiting class in 2005 [http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/college/051011vandy.html according to] ''[[Baseball America]]''.  In addition, All-American [[Curtis Casali]] will be attending in Fall 2007.[http://www.acorn-online.com/news/exec/view.cgi/28/9568]

In 2007, the Vanderbilt women's bowling team brought the university its first and only team NCAA championship.[http://vucommodores.cstv.com/sports/w-bowl/recaps/041407aab.html]

===Mascot===
Vanderbilt's intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the '''Commodores''', in honor of the nickname given to [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], who made his fortune in shipping.  Thus, students and alumni refer to Vanderbilt athletic teams as "Dores" or use the cheer, "Go Dores!"

The term ''[[commodore (rank)|commodore]]'' was used by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] during the mid- to late-nineteenth century.  A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. The closest parallel to this now-defunct rank is [[rear admiral|rear admiral lower-half]]. (In the [[Royal Navy]], the designation of commodore was applied to the commanding officer of a [[convoy]] in the [[Second World War]].)

Since the term was used most during the late nineteenth century&mdash;and because it was then that Cornelius received his nickname&mdash;Vanderbilt's mascot is always portrayed as a naval officer from the 1880s, complete with [[chops]], [[cutlass]], and nineteenth-century naval [[regalia]].

===School colors===
The school colors are [[black]] and [[Old gold|gold]].  Opinions vary as to the reason for selecting black and gold as the colors for Vanderbilt's teams.  Some say the original colors were orange and black, given to the university by Judge [[W.L. Granbery]] of [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Others say that Commodore Vanderbilt's legacy was called upon to develop school colors for the university that bears his name: black for the magnate's control of coal and gold for his money.

When questioned about the subject in the 1930s, the few remaining members of the school's first football squad from 1890 did not recall why they suddenly began appearing in black and gold. Whatever the source of the colors, by 1892, the Commodores were known by the colors that Vanderbilt fans still wear today.[http://www.hollywoodsportsbook.com/ncaa_football_history/footballhistory_vanderbilt.cfm]

===Traditions and rivalries===
*'''Rivalries'''  Vanderbilt's primary rival in almost every sport is the [[University of Tennessee]].  In addition, a rivalry exists with [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]]; the two schools play each other every year as SEC cross-division "permanent opponents."  Recently, [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]] and Vanderbilt have agreed to a seven-game football series beginning in 2007[http://news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060919/NEWSREC0105/609190307], which could possibly lead to a new rival for the Commodores.
*'''Southern football flavor'''  One aspect of Vanderbilt football (as well as football at most of the SEC schools) is the propensity of undergraduates, especially those who are members of social [[fraternities and sororities]], to dress in jacket and tie (for men) and sundresses (for women) for the games. Pre-game tailgates at the fraternity houses and fields surrounding the stadium remain popular, as well. Football games are often as much a social opportunity as they are a sporting event.  Because of this, arrival at football games is often "fluid": many students (and others) enjoy tailgating or parties prior to kickoff, resulting in the 2nd quarter being the start time for many fans.
*'''V-U Hand Sign'''  Formed by extending the thumb, index, and middle fingers of the hand, the resulting shape forms a "V" and "U".  This is a relatively recent development compared to other Vanderbilt traditions.
*'''Gameday traditions'''  In a conference with a long legacy of football traditions, Vanderbilt holds its own: the "Commodore Creed" in the football locker room; the "Corridor of Captains" that honors Vanderbilt's athletics history; the "Star Walk" with fans, cheerleaders, and the Spirit of Gold Marching Band; the "Star V," an on-field formation by the marching band; the "Touchdown Foghorn" from a U.S. Navy battleship that sounds when Vanderbilt scores; "Mr. Commodore," the mascot; and the "Victory Flag" that is raised over Dudley Field after home wins. In addition, many Vanderbilt students remain in the stadium after the final buzzer to sing the [[Alma Mater|alma mater]], regardless of the game's outcome.
*'''Fight song''' The Vanderbilt fight song, "[[Dynamite (fight song)|Dynamite]]," was written by student Francis Craig in 1924.  The song references the vigor with which Vanderbilt plays and the enthusiasm of the university's fans, who cheer regardless of the outcome of the game.

===Facilities===
Campus athletic facilities include:

*[[Vanderbilt Stadium]], seating capacity: 40,200
*[[Memorial Gymnasium (Vanderbilt University)|Memorial Gymnasium]], 14,168
*Hawkins Field, 2,000
*Vanderbilt Soccer/Lacrosse Complex, 2,400
*Brownlee O. Currey Jr. Tennis Center.

===Recent changes in athletics at Vanderbilt===
'''Restructuring.'''  Unique in NCAA Division I, Vanderbilt does not administer intercollegiate athletics separately from other student organizations, but as a part of the university's Division of Student Life, which oversees all student organizations and activities. When the change was instituted in September 2003, Chancellor Gordon Gee cited a need to reform college athletics, returning the emphasis to the ''student'' half of student-athletes.

'''Men's soccer dropped.'''  In January 2006, Vanderbilt's administration announced that the varsity men's soccer program would be eliminated at the end of the academic year, introducing varsity women's swimming in its place. The announcement was met with hostility from students, fans, and the team itself, whose coach, Tim McClements, had been named Coach of the Year by the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] in 2005.  Vice Chancellor for Student Life and University Affairs David Williams said that the decision was made because of budgetary reasons, the desires of Southeastern Conference officials, [[Title IX]] equality requirements, and the overall fit with the student body.
