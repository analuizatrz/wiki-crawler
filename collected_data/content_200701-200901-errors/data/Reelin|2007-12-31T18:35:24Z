'''Reelin''' is a [[protein]] found mainly in the [[brain]], but also in the spinal cord, blood and other body organs and tissues. Reelin is crucial for regulating the processes of [[Neural development#Neuronal Migration|neuronal migration]] and positioning in the developing brain.
Besides this important role in the early period, reelin continues to work in the adult brain. It modulates the [[synaptic plasticity]] by enhancing [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]] induction and maintenance.<!--

--> and regulates the continuing migration of [[neuroblast]]s generated in [[adult neurogenesis]] sites like [[subventricular zone|subventricular]] and [[subgranular zone]]s.

Reelin is implicated in pathogenesis of several brain diseases: significantly lowered expression of the protein have been found in [[schizophrenia]] and psychotic [[bipolar disorder]]. Total lack of reelin causes a form of [[lissencephaly]]; reelin also may play a role in [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[autism]]. 

Reelin's name comes from the abnormal reeling [[gait]] of ''[[reeler]]'' mice,<!--

--> which were found to have a deficiency of this brain [[protein]] and were [[Zygosity|homozygous]] for the RELN gene, which encodes reelin synthesis. 
The primary phenotype associated with loss of reelin function is inverted cortex, a neuroanatomical defect in which the six cortical layers are inverted.  [[Zygosity|Heterozygous]] mice for the reelin gene have very little obvious neuroanatomical defect but those that they have resemble the changes of the human [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] brain.

== History ==

Mutant mice provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of the development of the [[Central nervous system|CNS]]. These spontaneous mutations were first identified by scientists interested in motor behavior, and it proved relatively easy to screen litter mates for mice that showed difficulties moving around the cage. A number of such mice were found and given descriptive names such as reeler, weaver, lurcher, nervous, and staggerer.

The "[[reeler]]" mouse was first described in the [[1951]] edition of [[Journal of Genetics]] by [[Douglas Scott Falconer]].<ref name="falconer"/> Histopathological studies in the 1960's revealed that the reeler cerebellum is dramatically decreased in size and the normal laminar organization found in several brain regions is disrupted.<ref name="hamburgh"> Hamburgh M. (1963) Analysis of the postnatal developmental effects of "reeler", a neurological mutation in mice. A study in developmental genetics. Dev Biol. 19:165-85. PMID 14069672 </ref> 1970's brought the discovery of cellular layers inversion in the mice neocortex<ref name="caviness">Caviness VS Jr. (1976) ''Patterns of cell and fiber distribution in the neocortex of the reeler mutant mouse.'' J Comp Neurol. 170(4):435-47. PMID 1002868</ref>, which attracted more attention to the reeler mutation. 

In [[1995]], the RELN gene and protein were discovered at chromosome 7q22 by Gabriella D'Arcangelo and colleagues<ref name="Darcan1">D'Arcangelo G, Miao GG, Chen SC, Soares HD, Morgan JI, Curran T (1995) A protein related to extracellular matrix proteins deleted in the mouse mutant reeler. Nature 374: 719-723. PMID 7715726</ref>. Almost immediately,  Japanese scientists at [[Kochi Medical School]] had successfully created the first [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] for reelin, called CR-50.<ref name="cr50">Ogawa M, Miyata T, Nakajima K, Yagyu K, Seike M, Ikenaka K, Yamamoto H, Mikoshiba K. (1995) The reeler gene-associated antigen on Cajal-Retzius neurons is a crucial molecule for laminar organization of cortical neurons. Neuron. 14(5):899-912. PMID 7748558</ref> They noted that CR-50 reacted specifically with [[Cajal-Retzius cell|Cajal-Retzius neurons]], whose functional role was unknown till then. 

The downstream pathway of Reelin was clarified using other mutant mice, including [[yotari]] and [[Scrambler mouse|scrambler]]. These mice have phenotypes similar to that of reeler but have no mutation in reelin. It was then demonstrated that the mouse ''disabled homologue 1'' ([[DAB1|Dab1]]) gene, which encodes a homolog of ''Drosophila disabled'', is the gene responsible for the phenotypes of these mutant mice, and Dab1 protein was absent (yotari) or only barely (scrambler) detectable in these mutants.<ref name="yotari_and_scrambler">Sheldon M, Rice DS, D'Arcangelo G, Yoneshima H, Nakajima K, Mikoshiba K, Howell BW, Cooper JA, Goldowitz D, Curran T. (1997) Scrambler and yotari disrupt the disabled gene and produce a reeler-like phenotype in mice. Nature. 389(6652):730-3. PMID 9338784 </ref> Targeted disruption of Dab1 also caused a phenotype similar to that of reeler.

The Reelin receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, were discovered serendipitously by Trommsdorff et al, who found that the double [[Gene knockout|knockout]] mice for apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, which they generated for another experiment, showed defects in cortical layering similar to that in reeler.<ref name="receptors_discovery">Trommsdorff M, Gotthardt M, Hiesberger T, Shelton J, Stockinger W, Nimpf J, Hammer RE, Richardson JA, Herz J.

In the July of 2006, a group of Japanese scientists published the first report of [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[electron tomography]] investigation of reelin structure.<ref name="reelinstructure2006japan"/>

==Secretion and localization of reelin==

Studies show that Reelin is absent from [[synaptic vesicle]]s and is secreted via [[secretory pathway|constitutive secretory pathway]], being stored in [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] secretory vesicles.<ref name="golgi">Lacor PN, Grayson DR, Auta J, Sugaya I, Costa E, Guidotti A.

PMID 10725375 [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=10725375 free full text]</ref> Reelin's release rate is not regulated by [[depolarization]], but strictly depends on its synthesis rate. This relationship is similar to that reported for the secretion of other [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] proteins.

In the cortex and hippocampus, reelin is secreted by [[Cajal-Retzius cell]]s, Cajal cells, and Retzius cells during brain development.<!--

[[image:Schema of the Reelin protein vertical en.png|thumb|right|Schema of the Reelin protein]]
==Structure==

Reelin is a secreted [[extracellular matrix]] [[glycoprotein]] composed of 3461 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 388 [[Atomic mass unit|kDa]].

Reelin molecule starts with a signaling peptide 27 amino acids in length, followed by a region bearing similarity to [[F-spondin]], marked as "SP" on the scheme, and by a region unique to reelin, marked as "H". Next come the 8 repeats of 300-350 amino acids. These are called ''reelin repeats'' and have an [[Epidermal growth factor|EGF]] motif at their center, dividing each repeat into two subrepeats, ''A'' and ''B''. Despite this interruption, the two subdomains make direct contact, resulting in a compact overall structure.<!--

--><ref name="reelinstructure2006japan">Nogi T, Yasui N, Hattori M, Iwasaki K, Takagi J. (2006) ''Structure of a signaling-competent reelin fragment revealed by X-ray crystallography and electron tomography.'' EMBO Journal. PMID 16858396</ref>

The last comes a highly basic and short C-terminal region (CTR, marked "+") with a length of 32 amino acids. This region is extremely conservative, being 100% identical in all investigated mammals. It was thought that CTR is necessary for reelin secretion, because Orleans [[reeler]] mutation, which lacks a part of 8th repeat and the whole CTR, is unable to secrete the misshaped protein, leading to its concentration in cytoplasm. However, one recent study has shown that the CTR is not essential for secretion, which is most probably hindered then reelin is cut along one of the repeats.<!--

--><ref name="Nakano_2007_CTR_1">Nakano Y, Kohno T, Hibi T, Kohno S, Baba A, Mikoshiba K, Nakajima K, Hattori M. (2007) ''The extremely conserved C-terminal region of reelin is not necessary for secretion but is required for efficient activation of downstream signaling.'' The Journal of Biological Chemistry. 2007 May 15; PMID 17504759 [http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/M702300200v1 free full text]</ref><!--

-->  

Reelin is cleaved ''in vivo'' at two sites located after domains 2 and 6 - approximately between repeats 2 and 3 and between repeats 6 and 7, resulting in the production of three fragments.<!--

--><ref name="cleave">Lambert de Rouvroit C, de Bergeyck V, Cortvrindt C, Bar I, Eeckhout Y, Goffinet AM.(1999) ''Reelin, the extracellular matrix protein deficient in reeler mutant mice, is processed by a metalloproteinase.'' Exp Neurol. 156(1):214-7. PMID 10192793</ref><!--

--> This splitting does not decrease the protein's activity, as constructs made of the predicted central fragments (repeats 3â€“6) bind to lipoprotein receptors, trigger Dab1 phosphorylation and mimic functions of reelin during [[cortical plate]] development.<!--

--><ref name="centralfragment">Jossin, Y., Ignatova, N., Hiesberger, T., Herz, J., Lambert de Rouvroit, C. & Goffinet, A.M. (2004) ''The central fragment of Reelin, generated by proteolytic processing in vivo, is critical to its function during cortical plate development.'' J. Neurosci., 24, 514â€“521. PMID 14724251 ([http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/24/2/514 free full text])</ref>

== Function and mechanism of action ==
In the process of [[neural development]], Reelin acts on migrating neuronal precursors and controls correct cell positioning in the cortex and other brain structures. The proposed role is one of a dissociation signal for neuronal groups, allowing them to separate and go from tangential chain-migration to radial individual migration.<!--

--><ref name="roleofreelin1">Hack I, Bancila M, Loulier K, Carroll P, Cremer H. (2002) ''Reelin is a detachment signal in tangential chain-migration during postnatal neurogenesis.'' Nature Neuroscience 5(10):939-45. PMID 12244323 </ref><!--

--> Dissociation detaches migrating neurons from the [[glial cell]]s that are acting as their guides, converting them into individual cells that can strike out alone to find their final position.

In the adult brain, Reelin plays an important role by modulating cortical pyramidal neuron dendritic spine expression density, the branching of [[dendrite]]s, and the expression of [[long-term potentiation]]. 

===Mechanism of action===
Reelin acts on two receptors:
* [[VLDL receptor|VLDLR]] (very-low-density lipoprotein receptor) and the 
* [[ApoER2]] (apolipoprotein E receptor 2), 
which are members of the [[:Category:low density lipoprotein receptor gene family|Low density lipoprotein receptor gene family]].

The intracellular adaptor [[DAB1]] binds to the VLDLR and ApoER2 through an NPxY motif and is involved in transmission of Reelin signals through these lipoprotein receptors.

The proposal that the proto[[cadherin]] CNR1 behaves as a Reelin receptor<!--

--><ref name="cadherin">Senzaki K, Ogawa M, Yagi T. (1999) ''Proteins of the CNR family are multiple receptors for Reelin.'' Cell. 99(6):635-47. PMID 10612399</ref> has been disproved.<!--

--><ref name="centralfragment"/>

It has been shown that alpha-3-beta-1 [[integrin]] binds to the N-terminal region of reelin, a site distinct from the region of reelin shown to associate with other reelin receptors such as VLDLR/ApoER2.<!--

Reelin molecules have been shown<!--

--> to form a large protein complex, a [[Disulfide bond|disulfide-linked]] [[homodimer]]. If the homodimer fails to form, efficient tyrosine [[phosphorylation]] of DAB1 also fails.

Reelin-dependent strengthening of long-term potentiation is caused by [[ApoER2]] interaction with [[NMDA receptor]]. This interaction happens when ApoER2 has a region coded by exon 19. ApoER2 gene is alternatively spliced, with the exon 19-containing variant more actively produced during periods of activity.<!--

===Bipolar disorder===
Decrease in RELN expression is typical of [[bipolar disorder]] with psychosis, but is not characteristic of patients with major depression without psychosis.<ref name="szproof2"/>  

===[[Autism]]===
A number of studies have shown an association between the reelin gene and [[autism]]<ref name="autism1">Serajee FJ, Zhong H, Mahbubul Huq AH.(2006) Association of Reelin gene polymorphisms with autism.

===Temporal Lobe Epilepsy===
Decreased reelin expression in the hippocampal tissue samples from patients with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] was found to be directly correlated to the extent of [[granule cell]] dispersion, a major feature of the disease.<!--

Haas, Oliver Dudeck, Matthias Kirsch, Csaba Huszka, Gunda Kann, Stefan Pollak, Josef Zentner, and Michael Frotscher (2002) Role for reelin in the development of granule cell dispersion in temporal lobe epilepsy.

The Journal of Neuroscience, 26(17):4701-4713 PMID 16641251</ref><!--

--> According to one study, prolonged seizures in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have lead to the loss of reelin-expressing interneurons and subsequent ectopic chain migration and aberrant integration of newborn dentate granule cells.  Without reelin, the chain-migrating neuroblasts failed to detach properly.<!--

===[[Alzheimer's disease]]===
According to one study, reelin expression and [[glycosylation]] patterns are altered in [[Alzheimer's disease]]. In the cortex of the patients, reelin levels were 40% higher compared with controls, but the cerebellar levels of the protein remain normal in the same patients.<ref name="alz">Botella-Lopez A, Burgaya F, Gavin R, Garcia-Ayllon MS, Gomez-Tortosa E, Pena-Casanova J, Urena JM, Del Rio JA, Blesa R, Soriano E, Saez-Valero J. (2006) Reelin expression and glycosylation patterns are altered in Alzheimer's disease. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 103(14):5573-8. PMID 16567613</ref> This finding correlates with an earlier study showing the presence of Reelin associated with amyloid plaques in a transgenic AD mouse model. <ref name="alzmouse">Wirths O, Multhaup G, Czech C, Blanchard V, Tremp G, Pradier L, Beyreuther K, Bayer TA. (2001) ''Reelin in plaques of beta-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 double-transgenic mice.'' Neurosci Lett. 316(3):145-8. PMID 11744223</ref>
