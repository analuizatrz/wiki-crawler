'''Spider silk''' is a [[fibre]] secreted by [[spider]]s.
Spider [[silk]] is a remarkably strong material; the strongest naturally-occurring fiber known{{fact}}.  Its [[tensile strength]] is comparable to that of high-grade [[steel]] — according to [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] (see reference below), spider silk has a tensile strength of roughly 1.3 [[gigapascal|GPa]], while one source [http://www.geocities.com/pganio/materials.html] lists a tensile strength for one form of steel at 1.65 GPa.  However, spider silk is much less dense than steel; its ratio of tensile strength to density is perhaps 5 times better than steel — as strong as [[aromatic]] [[nylon]] filaments, such as DuPont's [[Kevlar]].  In fact, a strand of spider silk long enough to circle the earth would weigh less than 16 ounces{{fact}} (less than 460 grams).

==Usage==

[[image:Argiopesilk.jpg|right|thumb|280px|A female specimen of [[Argiope_appensa|''Argiope appensa'']] wraps her prey in silk.]] Spiders normally use their silk to make structures, either for protection for their offspring, or for predation on other creatures. They can also suspend themselves using their silk, normally for the same reasons.

The [[Trapdoor spider]] will burrow into the ground and weave a trapdoor-like structure with spindles around so it can tell when prey arrives and take it by surprise.

Many small spiders use silk threads for [[ballooning (spider)|ballooning]]. They extrude several threads into the air and let themselves become carried away with upward winds. Although most rides will end a few meters later, it seems to be a common way for spiders to invade islands. Many sailors have reported that spiders have been caught in their ship's sails, even when far from land.

Spider silk is also especially [[ductile]], able to stretch up to 40% of its length without breaking.  This gives it a very high [[toughness]] (or work to fracture), which according to "Liquid crystalline spinning of spider silk" (''Nature'', vol 410, p. 541), "equals that of commercial polyaramid (aromatic nylon) filaments, which themselves are benchmarks of modern polymer fiber technology." The notion that spider silk is stronger than any other fiber now known is thus erroneous, especially considering current research with [[carbon nanotube]]s that have yielded stronger fibers.  Nonetheless, there is much interest in duplicating the silk process artificially, since spiders use renewable materials as input and operate at room temperature and low pressure. Spider silk can be harvested in large scale quantities if one has proper harvesting equipment. One can also make near indestructible spidersilk threads by weaving the fine threads into thicker and more durable ones in the same fashion as industrial threads are made today.

Spider silk is made of complex [[protein]] [[molecule]]s.  This, coupled with the spider's preference&mdash;as a [[predator|predatory animal]]&mdash;for isolation from other [[species]], has made the study and replication of this substance quite challenging.  Because of the repetitive nature of the [[DNA]] encoding the silk protein, it is difficult to determine its [[sequencing|sequence]], and the silk from only 14 [[species]] has been decoded.  [[As of 2001]] ten such sequences have been completed through a collaboration between the [[University of California at Riverside]] and the [[University of Wyoming]].  In 2005 two biology researchers from the University of California at Riverside, Jessica Garb and Cheryl Hayashi, uncovered the molecular structure of the gene for the protein that female spiders use to make their silken egg cases.

Although different species of spider, and different types of silk, have different protein sequences, a general trend in spider silk structure is a sequence of amino acids (usually alternating [[glycine]] and [[alanine]], or alanine alone) that [[self-assembly|self-assemble]] into a [[beta sheet]] conformation. These "Ala rich" blocks are separated by segments of amino acids with bulky side-groups. The beta sheets stack to form [[crystals]], whereas the other segments form [[amorphous]] domains. It is the interplay between the hard crystalline segments, and the elastic amorphous regions, that gives spider silk its extraordinary properties.

== Synthesis ==

The [[yarn|thread]] is released through silk [[glands]]. Many [[species]] of [[spider]] have different [[spinneret|glands]] for different jobs, such as [[house|housing]] and [[spider web|web]] construction, defense, capturing and detaining [[prey]], mobility and in extreme cases even as [[food]].{{citation needed}}  Thus, the silk needs to be specialized for the task at hand so success is guaranteed.

The gland's visible, or external, part is termed the [[spinneret]].  Depending on the [[species]], spiders will have anything from two to eight [[spinneret]]s, usually in pairs.  The beginning of the gland is rich in [[thiol]] and [[tyrosine]] groups, the main ingredient to silk fiber.  After this beginning process, the [[ampulla]] acts as a storage [[sac]] for the newly created fibers.  From there, the spinning [[duct]] effectively removes [[water]] from the fiber and through fine channels also assists in its formation.  [[Lipid]] secretions take place just at the end of the distal limb of the [[duct]], and proceeds to the [[valve]].  The valve is believed to assist in rejoining broken fibers, acting much in the way of a [[helical pump]].

Various compounds other than protein are used to enhance the fiber's properties. [[Pyrrolidine]] has [[hygroscopic]] properties and helps to keep the thread moist. It occurs in especially high concentration in glue threads. [[Potassium]] [[hydrogen phosphate]] releases [[proton]]s in aqueous solution, resulting in a [[pH]] of about 4, making the silk [[acid]]ic and thus protecting it from [[fungus]] and [[bacteria]] that would otherwise digest the protein. [[Potassium nitrate]] is believed to prevent the protein from denaturating in the acidic milieu.<ref name=Heimer>Heimer, S. (1988). Wunderbare Welt der Spinnen. ''Urania''. p.12</ref>

The spinneret apparatus of a ''[[Araneus diadematus]]'' consists of the following glands:
* 500 [[Glandulae piriformes]] for attachment points
* 4 [[Glandulae ampullaceae]] for the web frame
* about 300 [[Glandulae aciniformes]] for the outer lining of egg sacs, and for ensnaring prey
* 4 [[Glandulae tubuliformes]] for egg sac silk
* 4 [[Glandulae aggregatae]] for glue
* 2 [[Glandulae coronatae]] for the thread of glue lines<ref name=Heimerp12>Heimer, S. (1988). Wunderbare Welt der Spinnen. ''Urania'' p.12</ref>

==Human use==
Peasants in the southern [[Carpathian Mountains]] used to cut up tubes built by ''Atypus'' and cover wounds with the inner lining. It reportedly facilitated healing, and even connected with the skin. This is believed to be due to antiseptic properties of spider silk (which is made of protein)<ref name=Heimer>Heimer, S. (1988). Wunderbare Welt der Spinnen. ''Urania''. p.14</ref>
Some fishermen in the indopacific ocean use the web of ''[[Nephila]]'' to catch small fish.<ref name=Heimer> </ref>
Spider silk, normally that of the golden orb spider, is occasionally harvested and spun into usable textiles. Due to the difficulty of the process, the resulting fabric is invariably extremely expensive, and is generally utilised in fine couture.

== Artificial spider silk ==
Spider silk's properties have made it the target of industrial research efforts. It is not generally considered possible to use spiders themselves to produce industrially useful quantities of spider silk, due to the difficulties of managing large quantities of small spiders (although it was tried with ''[[Nephila]]'' silk<ref name=Heimer> </ref>). It is thought that using one large genetically engineered "super-spider" would be more practical. Compared to [[silkworms]], spiders are aggressive and will eat one another, making it inadvisable to keep many small spiders together in the same space. Other efforts have involved extracting the spider silk [[gene]] and using other organisms to produce the required amount of spider silk. In [[2000]], [http://www.nexiabiotech.com/en/00_home/index.php Nexia], a [[Canadian]] [[biotechnology]] company, was successful in producing spider silk [[protein]] in [[transgenic]] [[goat]]s. These goats carried the gene for spider silk protein, and the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein. Attempts to spin the protein into a fiber similar to natural spider silk failed, however. The spider's highly sophisticated spinneret is instrumental in
organizing the silk proteins into strong domains. Specifically, the spinneret creates a gradient of protein [[concentration]], [[pH]], and [[pressure]], which drive the protein solution through [[liquid crystal|liquid crystalline]] [[phase transitions]], ultimately generating the required silk structure (which is a mixture of [[crystal|crystalline]] and [[amorphous]] [[biopolymer]] regions). Replicating these complex conditions in lab environment has proved difficult. Nexia attempted to press the pherotein solution through small extrusion holes in order to simulate the behavior of the spinneret, but this was insufficient to properly organize the fibers. Ultimately, Nexia was forced to abandon research on artificial spider silk, despite having successfully created the silk protein in [[genetically modified]] organisms.
