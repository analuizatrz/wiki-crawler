The naval '''Battle of Gangut''' ({{lang-ru|Гангутское сражение}}, {{lang-fi|Riilahden taistelu}}, {{lang-sv|Slaget vid Rilax}})  took place on July 27<sup>[[Julian calendar|Jul.]]</sup>/ [[August 7]] [[1714]]<sup>[[Gregorian calendar|Greg.]]</sup> during the [[Great Northern War]] (1700&ndash;21), in the waters of Riilahti Bay, north of the [[Hanko Peninsula]], near the site of the modern-day city of [[Hanko]], [[Finland]], between the [[Swedish Navy]] and [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. It was the first important victory of the Russian fleet in its history. 

==Name of the battle==
The word ''[[Gangut]]'' in the name of the battle is a [[romanization]] of Гангут, which is the traditional Russian [[cyrillization]] of ''Hangöudd'', the traditional [[Swedish language|Swedish]] name of the [[Hanko Peninsula]]<ref name="newspaper">[http://digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi/sanomalehti/secure/browse.html?action=directory&id=131&language=en Historical newspaper library]</ref>. Swedish is the prevailing language in this area of Finland. [[Transliteration]] of Russian forms of Western names is not common practice, except for bibliographical purposes. The common practice in translation from Russian is to write the Western name in its original form<ref name="BSE">[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], Third edition, English translation, 32 Volumes, 1973&ndash;1983</ref>. Seldom used names are ''Battle of Hangö'' <ref name="BSE6">[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], Third edition, English translation, Volume 6 (1975), page 527, Battle of Hangö</ref><ref name="KMLA">[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/18cen/greatnorthern.html World History at KMLA, The Great Northern War 1700&ndash;1721]</ref> ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Hanko'') and ''Battle of Hangöudd'' (Finnish ''Hankoniemi'''<ref name="newspaper" /><ref name="Toivanen">[http://www.starsoft.fi/bothnia/skampaen.html Pekka Toivanen, The burial grounds of the Russian galley fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia (Finland) from 1714, Bothnia Navalis and Jabobstad Museum, 1991]</ref>. The battle took place in the Rilax bay north of the Hanko Peninsula. In [[Sweden]] and Finland, the battle is therefore known as the ''Battle of Rilax'' (Finnish ''Riilahti'').

==Background==
The Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] had begun his offensive in Finland in the spring of [[1713]]. The Russian armies quickly advanced all the way to [[Turku]] on the southwestern coast of Finland, but naval advances had been blocked by a strong Swedish naval presence. The Russian governor in Finland, Prince Mikhail [[Galitzine]], with his headquarters in Turku, was unable to receive support by sea, which was then far more important than land-based support. Admiral [[Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin|Apraksin]]'s fleet was sent by the Tsar to open these service lines.

==Arrival at Hanko==
When the Russian ships arrived near the peninsula they were met by a strong Swedish naval fleet under the command of Admiral [[Gustaf Wattrang|Wattrang]]. Apraksin decided to move his ships farther away to the other side of the peninsula and call for reinforcements. The majority of the troops in Turku were moved according to his request to the peninsula.

A plea for help was also sent to the Tsar, who was with the rest of the [[Baltic Fleet]] in [[Tallinn|Reval]] (now Tallinn). Admiral Apraksin specifically let the tsar know that he should come personally to lead the attack.

==The breakthrough==
The first attempt in breaking through the Swedish lines was made by attempting to pull the [[galley]]s over the peninsula. The friction was reduced using oxskins between the ground and the ships. The first galley was successfully pulled over with much trouble, but the second was damaged, and the attempt was subsequently abandoned. However, Admiral Wattrang had been informed of the Russians' attempt, and he sent a small naval detachment consisting of 11 ships led by [[Schout-bij-nacht|Schoutbynacht]] (equivalent of a [[Rear Admiral]]) [[Nils Ehrenskiöld]] to intercept the Russians.

Ehrenskiölds detachment consisted of following ships:
;[[Pram (ship)|Pram]]
:''Elefant'', his flagship
;[[Galley]]s
:''Örnen''
:''Tranan''
:''Gripen''
:''Laxen''
:''Gäddan''
:''Valfisken''
;Smaller vessels (skerry-boats)
:''Flundran''
:''Simpan''
:''Gripen''
:''Mörten''

The second attempt by the Russians was to try to take advantage of the calm weather on the morning of [[26 July]], the day of [[Saint Pantaleon]]. The small galleys were easily maneuvered, whereas it was exceedingly difficult to try to turn the heavy Swedish battleships in such a weather. Apraksin initially sent 20 small galleys and when it became obvious that the Swedish fleet couldn't stop them, he sent 15 more.

Wattrang's fleet was moving outwards trying to block the Russian breakthrough, when Apraksin issued an order at midnight 26/27 July for the remaining ships to break through the Swedish lines. Only one galley was lost when it ran aground.

After the breakthrough Ehrenskiöld's detachment became encircled, and he ordered his vessels in a defensive line between two islands. The largest Swedish ship, the [[Pram (ship)|pram]] ''Elefant'', was positioned broadside-on to the approaching Russian vessels. Three galleys were stationed end-on on each side, with the two boats behind each end of ''Elefant''.

After Ehrenskiöld refused to [[Surrender (military)|surrender]], the Russian fleet attacked. The Russian galleys, commanded by the tsar, attacked twice (first with 35, second with 80 galleys) but were thrown back. The third time, when attacking with reinforcements and a combined force of about 95 galleys, the Russians managed to capture the Swedish ships. During the capture the galley ''Tranan'' capsized and sank, and admiral Ehrenskiöld himself was taken [[prisoner of war]] on the deck of his own [[flagship]].

The Russians substantially outnumbered the Swedish, according to some sources 15 to one. The Russian superiority in the battle was such that there wasn't even enough room for all the Russian vessels to fight at once.

==Consequences==

The battle was the first major victory of the Russian galley fleet, and can be as such compared with the [[Battle of Poltava]]. Due to the victory Russia was able to prevent Swedish ships from entering the waters east of the [[Sea of Åland]] and thus prolonging the occupation of Finland up to [[1721]], when the [[Treaty of Nystad]] ended the war.

The victory is even nowadays celebrated by the [[Russian Navy]], which has a long tradition of always having [[Russian battleship Gangut|one vessel named Gangut]]. The first series of [[Battleship|Dreadnought]] battleships for the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Imperial Navy]] was also named the [[Gangut class]].

The first monument to commemorate the Russian Navy, a wooden cross, was erected on the site in [[1869]] by Rear Admiral [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. The wooden cross was replaced by a more permanent stone cross in [[1870]] by the order of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]<ref name="newspaper" />.
