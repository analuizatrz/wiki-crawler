'''Immigration to Canada''' is the process by which people [[human migration|migrate]] to [[Canada]] and become [[Canadian citizens|nationals]] of the country. As Canada is a relatively new country, a formal immigration process has not been around for very long. Nevertheless, people have been [[migrating]] to the geographic region of Canada for thousands of years, patterns varying.  After 1947 domestic immigration law went through many major changes, most notably with the [[Immigration Act, 1976]] and the current [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]] from 2002. 

Currently Canada is known as a country with a broad immigration policy which is reflected in Canada's [[multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]]. According to the 2001 census by [[Statcan]] Canada has 34 ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members each, of which 10 have over 1,000,000 people and numerous others represented in smaller amounts. 13.4% of the population belonged to [[visible minorities]]: most numerous among these are [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] (3.5% of the population), [[Canadians of Asian ancestry|South Asian]] (3.1%), [[African Canadian|Black]] (2.2%), and [[Canadians of Filipino descent|Filipino]] (1.0%).

In 2004, Canada received 235,824 immigrants. The the top ten sending countries, by nationality, were [[People's Republic of China]] (37,280), [[India]] (28,183), [[Philippines]] (13,900), [[Pakistan]] (13,011), [[Iran]] (6,491), [[United States]] (6,470), [[Romania]] (5,816), [[United Kingdom]] (5,353), [[South Korea]] (5,351), and [[Colombia]] (4,600).<ref>[http://www.migrationinformation.org/datahub/countrydata/country.cfm Inflow of foreign-born population by country of birth, by year]</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Come To Stay.gif|thumb|250px|
''Come to Stay'', printed in [[1880]] in the [[Canadian Illustrated News]], which refers to immigration to the "[[Canada's Name#Adoption of Dominion|Dominion]]".]]

After the initial period of [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[New France|French colonization]], four major waves (or peaks) of [[immigration]] and settlement of non-aboriginal peoples took place over a period of almost two centuries, the fifth wave is currently ongoing.

The first significant, non-aboriginal immigration to Canada occurred over almost two centuries with slow but progressive [[French people|French]] settlement of [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]] with smaller numbers of American and European entrepreneurs in addition to British military personnel. This wave culminated with the influx of [[British Loyalist]]s fleeing the American Revolution, chiefly from the [[Mid-Atlantic States]].

The second wave from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] was encouraged to settle in Canada after the [[War of 1812]], which included [[British army]] regulars who had served in the war by the colonial governors of Canada, who were worried about another American [[invasion]] attempt and to counter the French-speaking influence of Quebec, rushed to promote settlement in back country areas along newly constructed plank roads within organized land tracts, mostly in [[Upper Canada]] (present-day Ontario).

With the second wave [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigration to Canada had been increasing when the [[Irish Potato Famine]] occurred from [[1846]]-[[1849]] resulting in hundreds of thousands more Irish arriving on Canada's shores, although a significant portion migrated to the [[United States]] over the subsequent decades. By 1867, over 80 percent of [[immigrants]] arrived in Canada by steamer. Although overall out migration to the more populous United States has exceeded immigrants coming from the US, there has been sustained immigration from the US over last two centuries and short periods of heavier migration in addition to the loyalist settlement, for example during 19th century [[Gold Rush|Gold Rushes]] to [[British Columbia]] and later the [[Yukon]]; land-seekers to the Prairies in the early 20th century and also during periods of political turmoil, for example the Vietnam War. 
During the 20th century, heavy waves of immigration, mostly from continental Europe peaked in 1910-1913 (over 400,000 in 1913) and again 1957 (282,000) making Canada a more [[multicultural]] country with substantial non-English or French speaking populations. For example, [[Ukrainian Canadian]]s account for the largest Ukrainian population outside of the Ukraine and Russia. Periods of low immigration also occurred during the first and second wars, in addition to the [[Great Depression]] period. 

Immigration since the 1970s until present has overwhelmingly been [[visible minorities]] from the developing world since restrictions on non-white immigration were altogether removed, starting when [[Lester B. Pearson]] was Prime Minister with the revised ''Immigration Act, 1967'' and this continued to be official government policy under his successor, [[Pierre Trudeau]]. During the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]] government, immigration levels were increased further by the late 1980s which have been maintained with slight fluctuations since (225,000-275,000 annually). 
 
Prior to 1885, restrictions on immigration were imposed mostly in response to large
waves of immigration rather than planned policy decisions, but not specifically targeted at one group or ethnicity, at least as official policy. Then came the introduction of the first [[Head tax (Canada)|Chinese Head Tax]] legislation passed in 1885, which was in response to a growing number of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] working on the [[Canadian Pacific Railroad]]. Subsequent increases in the head tax in 1900 and 1903 limited Chinese entrants to Canada. In 1923 the government passed the Chinese Immigration Act which excluded Chinese from entering Canada altogether between 1923 and 1947. For discriminating against [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] immigrants in past periods, an official government apology and compensations were announced on [[June 22]], [[2006]].

Canadian citizenship was originally created under the Immigration Act, 1910, to designate those British subjects who were domiciled in Canada. All other British subjects required permission to land. A separate status of "Canadian national" was created under the Canadian Nationals Act, 1921, which was defined as being a Canadian citizen as defined above, their wives, and any children (fathered by such citizens) that had not yet landed in Canada. After the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution. Because of this Canadians, and others living in countries that became known as [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, were known as ''subjects of the Crown''.  However in legal documents the term "British subject" continued to be used.

Canada was the first nation in the then [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] to establish its own nationality law in [[1946]], with the enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]]. This took effect on 1 January 1947. In order to acquire Canadian citizenship on 1 January 1947 one generally had to be a British subject on that date, an Indian or Eskimo, or had been admitted to Canada as landed immigrants before that date.  The phrase ''British subject'' refers in general to anyone from the UK, its colonies at the time, or a Commonwealth country. Acquisition and loss of British subject status before 1947 was determined by United Kingdom law (see [[History of British nationality law]]).

On 15 February 1977, Canada removed restrictions on dual citizenship.  Many of the provisions to acquire or lose Canadian citizenship that existed under the 1946 legislation were repealed. Canadian citizens are in general no longer subject to involuntary loss of citizenship, barring revocation on the grounds of immigration fraud.  

[[Statistics Canada]] has tabulated the effect of immigration on population growth in Canada from 1851 to 2001.<ref name=statcan_table/>

==Immigration rate==

In 2001, 250,640 people immigrated to Canada.  Based on the [[Canada 2001 Census]] total population of 30,007,094 people, immigration represented 0.834% population growth that year.  On a compounded basis, that immigration rate represents 8.7% population growth over 10 years, or 23.1% over 25 years (or 6.9 million people).  Since 2001, immigration has ranged between 221,352 and 262,236 immigrants per annum.<ref name=CIC1>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pub/facts2005/overview/1.html Annual Immigration by Category], [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref> According to ''Canada's Immigration Program'' (October 2004) Canada has the highest per capita immigration rate in the world,<ref name=CIP>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp190-e.htm Canada's Immigration Program (October 2004)], Library of Parliament, URL accessed 13 July 2006</ref> although statistics in the CIA World Factbook show that a number of city states and small island nations, as well as some larger countries in regions with refugee movements, have higher per capita rates.<ref name=CIA1>[http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact2002/fields/2112.html Field Listing - Net Migration Rate] [[Central Intelligence Agency]], The World Factbook 2002</ref> The three main official reasons given for the high level of immigration are: 
: '''A.'''  The social component – Canada facilitates family reunification.
: '''B.'''  The humanitarian component – Relating to refugees.
: '''C.'''  The economic component – Attracting immigrants who will contribute economically and fill labour market needs.

The level of immigration peaked in 1993 in the last year of the Progressive Conservative government and was maintained by Liberal Party of Canada.  Ambitious targets of an annual 1% per capita immigration rate were hampered by financial constraints.  The Liberals committed to raising actual immigration levels further in 2005. All political parties are now cautious about criticising of the high level of immigration, because, as noted by the [[Globe and Mail]], "in the early 1990s, the old [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] was branded '[[Racism by country#Canada|racist]]' for suggesting that immigration levels be lowered from 250,000 to 150,000."<ref name=Globevolpe>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FRTGAM.20051212.wxsmart12%2FBNStory%2FspecialDecision2006%2F&ord=1155737424463&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true Is the current model of immigration the best one for Canada?], [[Globe and Mail]], 12 December 2005, URL accessed 16 August 2006</ref>

Immigrant population growth is disproportionally concentrated in or near large cities (particularly [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], and [[Montreal]]). These cities are experiencing the strains that accompany strong population growth causing some residents to express concern about the declining [[livability]] of those cities. For example, a [[Toronto Star]] article published on 14 July 2006 authored by Daniel Stoffman noted that 43% of immigrants move to the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and said "unless Canada cuts immigrant numbers, our major cities will not be able to maintain their social and physical infrastructures".<ref name=Star>[http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1152181813101&call_pageid=968256290204&col=968350116795  When immigration goes awry], [[Toronto Star]], 14 July 2006, URL accessed 5 August 2006</ref> Most of the provinces that do not have one of those destination cities have implemented strategies to try to boost their share of immigration.

According to [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], under the [[Canada-Quebec Accord]], [[Quebec]] has sole responsibility for selecting most immigrants destined to the province.  Quebec has been admitting about the same number of immigrants as the number choosing to immigrate to [[British Columbia]] even though its population is almost twice as large.<ref name=CIC2>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pub/facts2005/permanent/18.html Annual Immigration by Province], [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref>

==Immigration categories==

There are three main immigration categories:
*'''Economic immigrants''' - Citizenship and Immigration Canada uses several sub-categories of economic immigrants. The high-profile ''Skilled worker principal applicants'' group comprised 19.8% of all immigration in 2005.<ref name=CIC1>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pub/facts2005/overview/1.html Annual Immigration by Category], [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref> In 2001 (the date of the last immigrant employment study) ''Skilled worker principal applicant'' landed immigrants had a 34% unemployment rate.<ref name=StatCan1>[http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/89-614-XIE/2005001/tables/table8.5.htm Labour Participation by immigration class], [[Statistics Canada]], URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref>  Spouses and children of ''Skilled workers'' comprised an even larger percentage of the ''Economic immigrant'' category at 29.3% of all immigration.<ref name=CIC1>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pub/facts2005/overview/1.html Annual Immigration by Category], [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref>
*'''Family class''' - Under a government program, both citizens and [[Permanent resident (Canada)|permanent residents]] can sponsor family members to immigrate to Canada. While this program has proven to be popular with recent immigrants, it has also been criticized by some for being too open-ended (i.e., a never-ending cycle of people related to yet more people which ultimately extends well beyond the original sponsor), a non-citizen can be a sponsor, and it allows retirees to immigrate who have not contributed significantly to the funding of the Canadian infrastructure, medical or social services system (the [[free rider problem]]). This category of immigrants also has a much lower labour force [[participation rate]] than economic immigrants.<ref name=StatCan1>[http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/89-614-XIE/2005001/tables/table8.5.htm Labour Participation by immigration class], [[Statistics Canada]], URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref>
*'''Refugees''' - Immigration of refugees and those in need of protection. This immigrant population has a high unemployment record (51% in 2001) of an already small labour participation rate (44%), resulting in extended financial dependence on government assistance for the vast majority of refugees.<ref name=StatCan1>[http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/89-614-XIE/2005001/tables/table8.5.htm Labour Participation by immigration class], [[Statistics Canada]], URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref>

Under [[Canadian nationality law]] an immigrant can apply for citizenship after living in Canada for 1095 days (3 years) in any 4 year period.<ref name=howtocitizen>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/citizen/becoming-howto.html Becoming a Canadian Citizen], [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], URL accessed 18 October 2006</ref>

==Economic impact==
:''See main article, [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada]]''

[[Population growth]] through immigration tends to boost [[GDP]], but not necessarily [[per capita income]] depending on whether immigrants have an income above or below the national average, and whether the skills they bring have impacts that multiply benefits throughout the economy. Analysis of census data as of 2000 shows that immigrant incomes were at 80% of the national average after 10 years of residing in Canada.<ref name=CDHowe>[http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/backgrounder_81.pdf Immigrants’ Declining Earnings:Reasons and Remedies], C.D. Howe Institute Backgrounder, [[C.D. Howe Institute]], No. 81, April 2004, URL accessed 1 September 2006</ref> 

Some observers note that almost all Canadians are either immigrants or descendants of immigrants and that the Canadian standard of living is one of the highest in the world. Therefore, based on this simple logic, these observers argue that immigration must have been beneficial to the Canadian economy, at least at some point in the past. In 1991, the [[Economic Council of Canada]] concluded that "A historical perspective gives little or no support to the view that immigration is needed for economic prosperity. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the fastest growth in per capita real incomes occurred at times with net immigration was nil or negative. Later in the 20th century, the opposite linkage is seen but, clearly, there is no long-term correlation." <ref name=EconCouncil>Economic Council of Canada (1991), Economic and Social Impacts of Immigration (Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada)</ref> A [[University of Montreal]] study published in 2002 by professor Marc Termote used different methods and studied different countries and concluded that immigration has no statistical impact to the per capita income of a country.<ref name=UOM>[http://www.erudit.org/revue/cqd/2002/v31/n1/000423ar.html La mesure de l’impact économique de l’immigration internationale.

The economic impact of immigration differs by immigration category.  For example, according to [[Statistics Canada]], there are significant differences in the labour force participation rates. 2001 labour force participation rates by category:<ref name=StatCan1>[http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/89-614-XIE/2005001/tables/table8.5.htm Labour Participation by immigration class], [[Statistics Canada]], URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref>
* Economic immigrants: 91%
* Economic immigrant spouses: 63%
* Family class immigrants: 59%
* Refugees: 44%
* Average of all immigrants: 70%
* Average of all Canadians: 68%[http://www.statcan.ca/english/Subjects/Labour/LFS/lfs-en.htm]

In 2001, the overall unemployment rate of immigrants was 37%. Federal and provincial government social programs can experience greater expense without corresponding tax revenue due to the low employment rate of immigrants. The [[Fraser Institute]] claims that the immigrants who arrived between 1990 and 2002 cost governments $18.3 billion (per [[annum]] (as of 2002) net of taxes raised from those immigrants) relating to universal social services.<ref name=FI>[http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/files/Immigration.pdf Immigration and the Welfare State in Canada: Growing Conflicts, Constructive Solutions], Public Policy Source, [[Fraser Institute]], Number 84, September 2005, URL accessed 22 August 2006</ref>

==Illegal immigration in Canada==
There is no credible information available on [[illegal immigration]] in Canada. Some estimates suggest that there may be up to 500,000 [[illegal immigrants]] in Canada.<ref name=CTVillegal>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060527/immigration_rallies_060527/20060527?hub=CTVNewsAt11 Rallies protest deportation of illegal workers], [[CTV News]], 27 May 2006, URL accessed 29 October 2006</ref> A further unsubstantiated claim is that most are [[refugee]] claimants whose refugee applications were rejected by the [[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]].<ref name=Globeillegal>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20031115.UILLE15%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3DCanada%2527s%2Bunderground%2Beconomy%2B&ord=1155738419213&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true 200,000 illegal immigrants toiling in Canada's underground economy], [[Globe and Mail]], 15 November 2003, URL accessed 16 August 2006</ref>  If already in the country, Canada does not ask any type of immigration applicant to re-enter the country for any extension or approval of their status. This differs from the U.S. which insists on re-entry for most types of applications, and denies entry if an application is declined.

It stands to reason that there may be very few illegal immigrants who enter the country without first being admitted by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]]. The reason for believing this is that Canada is physically very difficult to get to, with the exception of crossing the [[Canada-United States border]].  And in this case, since the U.S. is itself a prime destination for illegal immigrants, not many illegal immigrants then attempt an unauthorized border crossing into Canada.

==Immigration and crime==

In 2005, [[Gwyn Morgan]] raised the issue of linking refugees with [[crime in Canada]], saying among other things that "It's fair to say that most immigrants who abuse our society have come in as refugee claimants rather than 'economic immigrants'." His opinions on this topic were rejected by, most notably, some [[New Democratic Party]] and [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Members of Parliament.<ref name=Macleans2>[http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/politics/article.jsp?content=20060529_127613_127613#continue Q&A with retired oilman Gwyn Morgan], ''[[Maclean's]]'', 25 May 2006, URL accessed 1 July 2006</ref>

The federal [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada]] department ran a successful program from 1999 to 2003 called ''Project Early Intervention'' that targeted children in a community "made up of recent Arabic and Somalian immigrants" with the goal of reducing crime.<ref name=Early>[http://www.psepc.gc.ca/res/cp/ev/pe-en.asp Keeping Canadians Safe, Project Early Intervention], [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada]] website, URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref> In 2004, Canada established a national action plan, aimed in part at reducing violence, called ''A Canada Fit for Children'' which said "children of recent immigrants and refugee children are more likely to experience economic disadvantage with its associated risks."<ref name=Fit>[http://sen.parl.gc.ca/lpearson/specialsession/NPA-EN.pdf A Canada Fit for Children], Canada's national action plan in response to the UN's ''A World Fit for Children'' global action plan, URL accessed 2 July 2006</ref>

[[List of terrorist attacks in Canada|Terrorist attacks in Canada]] have been committed by both foreign-born (mostly [[naturalization|naturalized citizens]]) and Canadian-born people. The first one's being [[Dukhobors]] in [[British Columbia]] who were [[Russians|Russian]] immigrants in 19th and early 20th century. In 1903 a radical faction of the Doukhobours calling themselves Svobodniki (Freedomites) or the 'Sons of Freedom' (SOF) was involved in sabotage against Canadian commercial interests. A small group of the SOF participated in mass nudity and arson as means of protesting against materialism, the land seizure by the government, compulsory education in government schools and Verigin's assassination. This led to many confrontations with the Canadian government and the RCMP which continued into the 1960s and later. The only man convicted ([[Inderjit Singh Reyat|Reyat]]) in Canada's most deadly terrorist attack, [[Air India Flight 182]], is a former Indian citizen. Half of the 12 identified alleged terrorists in the [[2006 Toronto terrorism case]] are foreign-born and the other half are Canadian-born. [[Ahmed Ressam]], an illegal immigrant (whose refugee application was previously rejected) living in Canada was an [[al-Qaeda]] operative who tried in 1999 to enter the United States to attack it with explosives found in his vehicle, has been referred to by some pundits in the United States as an example of how Canada's immigration policies and allegedly weak controls pose a potential terrorism threat to the United States.  Canadian immigrants from [[Sri Lanka]] were arrested in the U.S. in August 2006 as part of a terrorist arms-trading plot and have contributed to the impression that Canada's policies facilitate terrorist activity.<ref name=shopping>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060828.HEZBOLLAH28/TPStory/National As far as shopping for terror, Canada seems to be the place], [[Globe and Mail]], 28 August 2006, URL accessed 28 August 2006</ref>  Notwithstanding incorrect statements from some elected U.S. politicians, none of the terrorists who participated in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] entered the United States from Canada<ref name=misinfo>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/facts-myths/united-states.html Canada’s Immigration Policies — Misperception vs. Reality], [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], URL accessed 14 October 2006</ref>

The reality is that no credible organization, such as [[Statistics Canada]], has published a study on immigration and crime in Canada, so there are few conclusions on the topic.
