'''Ian James Thorpe [[Order of Australia|OAM]]''' (born [[13 October]] [[1982]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]), also known as the '''''Thorpedo''''' or '''''Thorpey''''', is a former [[Australia]]n [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]] [[Swimming#Competitive swimming|swimmer]]. He has won five [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals, the most won by any Australian, and in [[2001 World Aquatics Championships|2001]] he became the first person to win six gold medals in one World Championship.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 274–275.</ref> In total, Thorpe has won eleven World Championship golds, the second-highest number of any swimmer.<ref name="gsiprofile">{{cite web | url = http://www.grandslamint.com/PlayerProfile/PlayerProfile.aspx?p=3&id=7 | title = Ian Thorpe | publisher = Grand Slam International | accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref> Thorpe is the only person to have been named [[Swimming World Swimmers of the Year|World Swimmer of the Year]] four times by ''[[Swimming World Magazine]]'',<ref name="hunterviii">Hunter (2004), p viii</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Swimming World's - World Swimmers of the Year| date= [[2005]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 | publisher=[[Swimming World Magazine]] | url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/SwimmersOfTheYear.asp}}</ref> and was the Australian swimmer of the year from 1999 to 2003. His athletic achievements made him one of Australia's most popular athletes, with his philanthropy and clean image earning him further recognition as the [[Australian of the Year|Young Australian of the Year]] in 2000.<ref name="gsiprofile"/>

At the age of 14, he became the youngest male ever to represent Australia,<ref>Hunter (2004), p. 75.</ref> and his victory in the 400&nbsp;metre freestyle at the [[1998 World Aquatics Championships|1998 Perth World Championships]] made him the youngest ever individual male World Champion.<ref name ="andrews">{{cite book | last= Andrews | first= Malcolm| title = Australia at the Olympics |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]| location = [[Sydney]]|year=2000|pages=487|isbn=0-7333-0884-8 }} pp. 434–436.</ref> After that victory, Thorpe dominated the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, winning the event at every Olympic, World, [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] until his break after the 2004 Olympics.<ref name="abc career">{{cite news| url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200611/s1793724.htm?swimming | title = Ian Thorpe - Career at a glance| publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = [[2006-11-21]]| accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref> Aside from 13 individual long-course world records, Thorpe anchored the Australian relay teams, numbering the victories in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m and the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relays [[2000 Summer Olympics|in Sydney]], among his five relay world records. His wins in the 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m and his bronze in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle [[2004 Summer Olympics|in Athens]] have made him the only person to have won medals in the 100-200-400 combination.<ref name="abc career"/>

After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a year away from swimming, scheduling a return for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. However, he was forced to withdraw due to illness. Subsequent training camps were interrupted, and he announced his retirement in November 2006, citing waning motivation.<ref name="abc retire">{{cite news |first = |last = |title = Thorpe announces retirement |url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200611/s1793622.htm  |publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = [[2006-10-21]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref>

==Early years==
Thorpe was a large baby, weighing 4.1&nbsp;kg (9.02&nbsp;lb) and measuring 0.59&nbsp;m (1&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in) in length at birth. He grew up in a family with a sporting pedigree in the suburb of [[Milperra, New South Wales|Milperra]].<ref name ="dyk">{{cite news |title = Did you know?|url =http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/did-you-know/2006/11/21/1163871405651.html |publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref> Thorpe's father, Ken, was a promising [[cricket]]er at junior level, representing [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] cricket club in Sydney's grade competition.<ref name ="dyk"/><ref name ="smh early">{{cite news |first=Michael|last=Cowley|title = A career that sets the gold standard|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/a-career-that-sets-the-gold-standard/2006/11/21/1163871405639.html |publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref> A talented [[batsman]], he once topped the season's [[Batting average#Cricket|batting averages]] ahead of former Australian [[captain (cricket)|captain]] [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]]. However, paternal pressure detracted from Ken's enjoyment, and he retired aged 26. Thorpe's mother Margaret played A-grade [[netball]],<ref name ="smh early">{{cite news |first=Michael|last=Cowley|title = A career that sets the gold standard|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/did-you-know/2006/11/21/1163871405651.html |publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref><ref name="hunter1-6"> Hunter (2004), pp. 1–6.</ref> but Thorpe did not seem to inherit his parents' ball skills. His elder sister, Christina, had been given medical advice that swimming would strengthen a broken wrist, so by chance, the five-year-old Thorpe followed her in taking swimming lessons .<ref name ="smh early"/><ref>Hunter (2004), p. 102.</ref> Due to his unhappy experiences, Ken Thorpe maintained that enjoyment was the most important aspect of his children's participation in sport.<ref name="hunter1-6" />

As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined due to a [[chlorine]] [[allergy]].<ref name ="andrews"/> Because of this, he did not swim in his first race until age seven (at a school carnival). His allergy forced him to swim with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage.<ref name ="dyk"/><ref>Hunter (2004), p. 19–22.</ref> Thorpe gradually overcame the allergy and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools titles in [[1994 in sports|1994]]. He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the State Age Short Course Championships in September of that year.<ref>Hunter (2004), p. 36–39.</ref> In 1995 he started his secondary education at [[East Hills Boys Technology High School]],<ref name ="dyk"/> switching coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of [[Doug Frost]]. It was a busy year for his family, with Christina being selected for the national team to compete at the [[1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Ian, now six feet tall, competed at his first National Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m freestyle. He won all ten events at the annual State Age Championships.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref>{{cite book | last= Talbot | first= Don| authorlink = Don Talbot|coauthors= Kevin Berry and Ian Heads |publisher=Lothian |place=[[Melbourne]]|year=2003| title=Talbot: Nothing But the Best | pages=302|isbn=0-7344-0512-X}} pp. 224–225.</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 46–49.</ref>

===National debut===
Thorpe competed at the [[1996 in sports|1996]] National Age Championships in [[Brisbane]], winning five gold, two silver and two bronze medals.<ref name="abc career"/> His times in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle and 200&nbsp;m [[backstroke]] qualified him for the Australian Championships, which were selection events for the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]]. Frost knew that Thorpe had no realistic chance of finishing among the top two in any event, which would have meant Olympic selection at an age of only 13 years and 6 months. He sent him to [[Sydney]] anyway to gain racing experience at the senior national level. As expected, Thorpe missed selection, as he finished 23rd in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle and 36th in the 200&nbsp;m backstroke.<ref name="h96">Hunter (2004), pp. 65–70.</ref> At the end of the year, he qualified for the Australian Short Course Championships. It was another chance for Thorpe to gain national selection, as they were the trials for the [[1997 FINA Short Course World Championships]]. He qualified in second place for his first national final in the 400&nbsp;m individual medley, but swam more slowly in the final to miss selection.<ref name="h97"/>

1997 began at the State Championships in January, where his time of 3&nbsp;min 59.43&nbsp;s in the 400&nbsp;m took eight seconds off his personal best, and made him the first 14-year-old in Australia to cover the distance in less than four minutes. Ranked fourth in Australia for the event,<ref name="h97">Hunter (2004), pp. 72–73.</ref> Thorpe went into the [[1997 in sports|1997]] Australian Championships in [[Adelaide]] as a serious contender for national selection for the [[1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] in [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], [[Japan]]. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required, Thorpe focused on the 400&nbsp;m freestyle after injuries to the 400&nbsp;m freestyle Olympic medallists [[Kieren Perkins]] and [[Daniel Kowalski]]. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander [[Grant Hackett]], setting a new personal best of 3&nbsp;min 53.44&nbsp;s. It was a new world age record and the first of many battles with Hackett.<ref name="h97p"/>

Aged 14 years and 5 months, Thorpe became the youngest male ever to be selected for the Australian team,<ref name ="andrews"/> surpassing [[John Konrads]]' record by one month.<ref name = "ABC profile">{{cite news | title=Ian Thorpe: On course to sink Athens opposition | date= [[2004]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | url=http://abc.net.au/olympics/2004/profiles/ianthorpe.htm}}</ref> Frost cited Thorpe's selection as a cause for his eventual focus on freestyle. Thorpe continued his good form at the National Age Championships when he contested all twelve events, winning ten individual gold and two bronze medals, and setting six national records in the process.<ref name ="smh early"/><ref name="h97p">Hunter (2004), pp. 73–76.</ref>

== Early International career ==
=== International debut ===

In June, two months before the 1997 Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe required an [[vermiform appendix|appendix]] operation, causing him to miss two weeks of training.<ref>Hunter (2004), p. 82.</ref> Thorpe came fourth in his heat of the 200&nbsp;m freestyle after achieving a personal best of 1&nbsp;min 51.46&nbsp;s. Despite not qualifying for the final, he earned selection for the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relay team. There he and his team of [[Michael Klim]], [[Ian van der Wal]] and Hackett claimed silver, making him the youngest ever Pan Pacific medalist. In his first individual final at international level, Thorpe came from fifth at the 300&nbsp;m mark to claim silver in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle behind Hackett in a time of 3&nbsp;min 49.64&nbsp;s.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref name="andrews h"> Malcolm (2000), pp. 191–192.</ref> His finishing burst was to become a trademark, and his time would have given him silver at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympics]].<ref name ="smh early"/><ref>Hunter (2004), p. 75.</ref> In October 1997, a few days before his fifteenth birthday, Thorpe competed in qualifying trials in [[Brisbane]] for the [[1998 World Aquatics Championships]]. Thorpe gained selection for the Championships in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in January by finishing fourth and second respectively in the 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m freestyle, setting new personal best times in both events.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 91–92.</ref>

Thorpe's first international appearance in his home country, at the [[1998 World Aquatics Championships|1998 World Championships]] in Perth, began with the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg after Klim and Hackett, Thorpe broke away from 200&nbsp;m butterfly Olympic champion [[Tom Malchow]] to set a split time of 1&nbsp;min 47.67&nbsp;s, the same as Klim's winning time in the 200&nbsp;m final. By the end of Thorpe's leg, the Australians were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans, having extended the lead by two body lengths. Although anchorman Kowalski finished outside the world record, it was the first time that Australia had won the event at the global level since [[1956 in sports|1956]].<ref name="abc career"/> Thorpe was ranked fourth in the world before the 400&nbsp;m final, which Hackett led from the outset. Hackett established a comfortable 2.29&nbsp;s lead over Thorpe by the 300&nbsp;m mark, and although Thorpe reduced the margin to 1.53&nbsp;s at the 350&nbsp;m mark, Hackett lead until Thorpe passed him on the final stroke. Thorpe's time was the fourth fastest in history and made him the youngest ever male individual world champion.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref name ="andrews h"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 96–102.</ref>

As a result of the media attention generated by his win on home soil, Thorpe received multiple offers for television commercials and was often surrounded by autograph hunters. He became a high-profile supporter of the [[Children's Cancer Institute]], after his sister Christina's future brother-in-law Michael Williams became gravely ill with cancer.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 95–102.</ref>

Thorpe's next competition was in March at the Australian Championships in [[Melbourne]], which were selection trials for the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Malaysia]]. Thorpe's improvement continued when he defeated Klim in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle in 1&nbsp;min 47.24&nbsp;s, faster than Klim's winning time at the World Championship two months earlier. Thorpe's time was a Commonwealth record and with it, he secured his first national title. He then claimed the 400&nbsp;m freestyle title from Hackett and clocked 50.36&nbsp;s in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle. His time earned silver in his first 100&nbsp;m race at the national level, gaining him Commonwealth selection in three individual events.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 110–113.</ref>

Thorpe's rise continued when the Australians arrived in [[Kuala Lumpur]] during September for the Commonwealth Games. Thorpe's first event was the 200&nbsp;m freestyle, where he led throughout to record a time just one hundredth of a second outside [[Giorgio Lamberti]]'s world record. He then combined with Klim, Kowalski and [[Matt Dunn]] in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relay to break the world record of the [[Unified Team]] set in 1992 by 0.09&nbsp;s.<ref>{{cite news |first = |title = 1998 Commonwealth Games  |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/636.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[1998-09-25]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}</ref> Thorpe's run ended when a personal best of 50.21&nbsp;s in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle was only sufficient for fourth place, but he returned to victory with the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay team. He claimed a fourth gold in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, setting another personal best, just 0.55&nbsp;s slower than Kieren Perkins' [[1994 in sports|1994]] mark.<ref name="abc career"/><ref>{{cite news |first = |title = 1998 Commonwealth Games: Day 4 |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/637.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[1998-09-26]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref><ref name ="andrews"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 121–123.</ref>

Thorpe left school at the end of year after completing Year 10. His decision caused concerns that concentrating on swimming alone could lead to burn out. Thorpe disagreed, pointing to his informal search for knowledge, stating that "Swimming is a small part of my life". His impact in the swimming community was acknowledged when he became the youngest male swimmer to be named by ''[[Swimming World Magazine]]'' as the [[Swimming World Swimmers of the Year|World Swimmer of the Year]].<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 130–133.</ref>

== World record breaking phase ==
[[1999 in sports|1999]] began with heavy media expectations that Thorpe would inevitably break both 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m world records, given his continuing physical growth. The first opportunity came in late March at the 1999 Australian Championships in Brisbane, which doubled as a selection event for the [[1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]]. Thorpe again won the 400&nbsp;m, but Perkins' record eluded him, this time by just 0.05&nbsp;s. Hackett turned the tables in the 200&nbsp;m event, passing Thorpe in the final 50&nbsp;m to win Thorpe's title.<ref name ="andrews h"/> Although both were outside Lamberti's mark, Hackett went on to break it the following night in a relay event.<ref>{{cite news |first = |title = Hackett Breaks 200 m Freestyle World Record |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/817.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[1999-03-24]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}</ref> Thorpe finished the Championships by continuing his improvement in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle, posting a time of 49.98&nbsp;s, his first under the 50&nbsp;s barrier. The Australian team then travelled to [[Hong Kong]] for the [[1999 FINA Short Course World Championships]], where Thorpe broke Lamberti's mark in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle, the longest standing world record at the time.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 137–139.</ref> This was the start of a three year phase where Thorpe was to set his 13 individual long course world records. He lead the men's relay team to unprecedented success in relay events, scoring historic victories over the Americans. Thorpe was to peak in 2001 when he became the first person to win six gold medals at one world championships, setting three world records and helping Australia top the medal tally at a global meet for the first time since 1956. In this period, he was named  by ''Swimming World'' as its ''Swimmer of the Year'' three times.<ref name="hunterviii"/><ref name="gsiprofile"/><ref name="abc career"/>

The [[1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] were held in August at [[Sydney Olympic Park]], and were viewed as a rehearsal for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] to be held in the same venue. With Thorpe expected to deliver world records at his first international meet in Sydney, the event was shown live on Australian television for the first time.  The opening night saw him pitted against Hackett and [[South Africa]]'s [[Ryk Neethling]] in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle final. The trio reached the 200&nbsp;m mark in a group, on world record pace, before Thorpe broke away, recording a split time 1.86&nbsp;s ahead of world-record pace at 300&nbsp;m. He extended his lead to four body lengths by the 350&nbsp;m mark and finished in a time of 3&nbsp;min 41.83&nbsp;s, cutting almost two seconds from the world record,<ref name="abc career"/> and covering the second half in almost the same time as the first.<ref name ="firstwr">{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last= Thomas|title = 1999 Pan Pacific Championships: Day 1 |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/981.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[1999-08-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}</ref> Talbot reacted to the performance by dubbing Thorpe as "the greatest swimmer we've [Australia] ever had", whilst four-time American Olympic gold medalist [[Rowdy Gaines]], commentating for [[NBC]], said "..he went into a balls-out sprint at 250 - and I have never seen anything like that...I have been around swimming a long time and it's the most amazing swim I've ever seen, hands down." A formula used by the International Swimming Statisticians Association to compare world records in different events gave his performance the highest score of all current world records. Thorpe promptly donated the [[Australian dollar|A$]]25,000 prizemoney for breaking the first world record in the pool to charity.<!-- which charity? --><ref name ="andrews"/><ref name="gsiprofile"/> Later the same night, Thorpe anchored the Australians to a historic victory in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle final, the first time the United States had lost the event. Thorpe set an Australian record relay split of 48.55&nbsp;s. Even taking into account a 0.6–0.7&nbsp;s for a flying relay start, his split time was almost 1&nbsp;s faster than his individual best of 49.98&nbsp;s.<ref name ="firstwr"/> It was to be the first of many occasions in which he would anchor the Australian relay teams to victory over the Americans, with splits consistently faster than his equivalent individual times. The following night, in the semi-finals of the 200&nbsp;m freestyle, Thorpe broke Hackett's world record by 0.33&nbsp;s, clocking 1&nbsp;min 46.34&nbsp;s.<ref name="abc career"/><ref>{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last= Thomas|title = 1999 Pan Pacific Championships: Day 2 |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/984.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[1999-08-23]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}</ref> The next day in the final, he again broke the record, lowering it to 1&nbsp;min 46.0&nbsp;s.<ref name="abc career"/><ref>{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last= Thomas|title = 1999 Pan Pacific Championships: Day 3 |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/985.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[1999-08-24]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}</ref> He finished his competition by leading off the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle team with Klim, Hackett and [[Bill Kirby]] to victory.

Immediately after the Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe's management announced his signing to [[Adidas]] for an undisclosed six-figure sum, stating that he would race in their new bodysuit. This presented a dilemma, as the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by [[Speedo]], leading to months of protracted discussions and uncertainty.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 162–166.</ref> To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had a uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a bone in his ankle whilst jogging.<ref>{{cite news |title = Thorpedo Torpedoed |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/1043.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[1999-10-21]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}</ref> However his performance throughout the year were recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by ''Swimming World'', and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year.

===2000 Olympic build-up===
Thorpe started [[2000 in sports|2000]] looking to add a third individual event to his Olympic schedule<!-- to be performed in front of an expectant home crowd-->. He explored his options by contesting the 1500&nbsp;m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won. Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour in order to hone his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by comments made by German head coach [[Manfred Thiesmann]] accusing him of using [[anabolic steroid|steroids]].<ref name = "Talbot blood"> Talbot (2003) p. 156.</ref> Thorpe's difficulties heightened at the subsequent [[Germany|German]] leg of the tour in [[Berlin]], when a standoff over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample due to lack of containers.

Entering the Olympics, the Australian public expected Thorpe to deliver multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney's ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Telegraph]]'' posted a front-page spread headlined ''Invincible''. Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400&nbsp;m on the first morning of competition, posting a new Olympic record and shortening bookmakers' odds to 50-1.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phillip|last= Whitten|title =Olympic Day 1 Prelims - Complete |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/1781.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[2000-09-16]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified &mdash; the host nation had yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe led throughout, and although [[Italy]]'s [[Massimiliano Rosolino]] was within a body length at the 300&nbsp;m mark, Thorpe's finishing kick extended the final margin to three body lengths.

Thorpe lined up later in the night alongside Klim, [[Chris Fydler]] and [[Ashley Callus]] to anchor the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay, an event which the Americans had never lost at Olympic level. The third leg ended with Australia only an arm's length ahead of the United States. Thorpe timed his dive much better than [[Gary Hall Jr.]], and surfaced a body length ahead. Hall's sprinting ability allowed him to open a lead by the final turn, but Thorpe's finishing kick overhauled him in the final metres, sparking wild celebrations amongst the partisan crowd.<ref name="abc career"/><ref name ="oly2000 d1"/> It evoked an uncharacteristic celebration from Thorpe, who immediately jumped out of the pool, screaming and hugging his ecstatic teammates.

However, Van den Hoogenband showed his hand in the semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1&nbsp;min 45.35&nbsp;s. Thorpe qualified second and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phillip|last= Whitten|title = Olympic Day 2 Finals  |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/1792.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[2000-09-17]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100&nbsp;m mark just 0.04&nbsp;s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150&nbsp;m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as Van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd.

With the [[2001 in sports|2001]] Australian Championships held in [[Hobart]] in March, Thorpe added the 800&nbsp;m freestyle to his repertoire, after [[International Swimming Federation|FINA]] had added the event for the [[2001 World Aquatics Championships]]. Thorpe began his campaign by successfully defending his 400&nbsp;m title with a time just 0.17&nbsp;s outside his world record.<ref>{{cite news |title = Aussie World Champs Trials: Thorpe Just Misses Breaking Own 400 Free World Record |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/2354.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[2001-03-26]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref> The following night in the 800&nbsp;m event, he drew away from Hackett in the last 100&nbsp;m to break [[Kieren Perkins]]' 1994 world record by over four seconds.<ref name="abc career"/><ref>{{cite news |first=Ian|last= Hanson|title = Aussie Nationals: Ian Thorpe Destroys World Record in the 800; Hackett Also Under Old Mark |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/2354.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[2001-03-26]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref> He earned his third title by cutting 0.66&nbsp;s from Van den Hoogenband's 200&nbsp;m world record to set a new mark of 1&nbsp;min 44.69&nbsp;s.<ref name="abc career"/><ref>{{cite news |first=Belinda|last= Dennett|title = The Thorpedo Does It Again!!

Thorpe arrived in Fukuoka having been chosen by broadcaster [[TV Asahi]] as the marketing drawcard of the event. With the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay being held after the 400&nbsp;m freestyle on the first night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy when he reached the 200&nbsp;m mark two seconds outside his world record. Although he was 0.93&nbsp;s behind at the final turn, a final 50&nbsp;m burst in 24.36&nbsp;s saw him cut a further 0.42&nbsp;s from his world record. The relay saw him  dive in fractionally ahead of American [[Jason Lezak]] after Klim, Callus and Pearson had completed the first three legs. Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages, to seal gold with his fastest-ever relay split of 47.87&nbsp;s.<ref>{{cite news |first=Craig|last= Lord|title = Thorpe Sets WR, Wins Two Gold on First Day of Competition at World Champs  |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/2724.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[2001-07-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref> In the 800&nbsp;m final, he shadowed Hackett for the first 750&nbsp;m, staying within a body length.

He lowered his world record to 1&nbsp;min 44.06&nbsp;s in the process, prompting Van den Hoogenband to raise his arm aloft.<ref>{{cite news |first=Craig|last= Lord|title = The Thorpedo Strikes Again--Another Awesome World Record |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/2736.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[2001-07-25]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22  }}</ref> Thorpe's winning streak was interrupted in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle when his personal best of 48.81&nbsp;s placed him fourth, but he returned to form in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relay.

Thorpe began competition in [[2002 in sports|2002]] at the Australian Championships in [[Brisbane]] in March, which were used to select the team for the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Manchester]] and the [[2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]]. After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match [[Mark Spitz|Spitz]]'s seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400&nbsp;m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break a world record was the talking point. He claimed the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m events in times outside his best, making it the first time that he had failed to break a world record at a major meet since 1999.<ref name="swiminfo 2002">{{cite news |first = Phillip|last = Whitten|title = 2002 Year in Review |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/2002_year_in_review.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date = [[2006-12-30]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21  }}</ref> He also experimented by adding the 100&nbsp;m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second.

By this time, Thorpe's relationship with Frost was beginning to unravel. Thorpe had always insisted that his swimming was about enjoyment and improving himself in setting faster times, rather than victory or defeat. This contrasted with Frost, who had a more aggressive and combative mindset, often making bold public statements. Thorpe ignored Frost's advice and bulked up his upper body by a further 5&nbsp;kg to 105&nbsp;kg, making him the heaviest elite swimmer in history. His reasoning that the strength gains would outweigh any loss in flexibility raised concerns over his physiological strategy.<ref>Talbot (2003), pp. 228–229.</ref> On the first night in Manchester, Thorpe again lowered his 400&nbsp;m mark by 0.09&nbsp;s to 3&nbsp;min 40.08&nbsp;s,<ref name="abc career"/><ref name="swiminfo 2002"/> before anchoring the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay team to another gold.<ref name="bbc cg2002">{{cite news |title = Thorpe's six of the best |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/hi/swimming/newsid_2166000/2166261.stm | publisher = [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = [[2006-08-02]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}</ref> Prior to the 200&nbsp;m final, Thorpe was seen arguing with Frost in the warm-up area.

Admitting that tension existed between him and Frost, Thorpe asserted that the split was amicable. He cited waning motivation for the split, stating "I decided I either had to make the change or it was to walk away from the sport".<ref>{{cite news |title = Thorpe splits with coach |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/2253415.stm |publisher = BBC Sports |date=September 12, 2002 |accessdate = 2006-11-08}}</ref> The retired Talbot expressed concerns that Thorpe was making a decision whilst he was physically and emotionally drained, while other coaches felt that the new relationship would end up with making Thorpe, rather than Menzies, making the decisions.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 311–313.</ref><ref>Talbot (2003), pp. 232–233.</ref><ref name="ABC profile"/> Despite a turbulent year, he was again named by ''Swimming World'' as its World Swimmer of the Year.<ref name="swiminfo 2002"/> 

Along with the switch of coaches, Thorpe indicated that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800&nbsp;m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, particular during the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that his results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 389–398.</ref>

The first major test of Thorpe's partnership with Menzies came at the Australian Championships held in Sydney in March. Thorpe did not threaten any of his world records, completing the 400&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m freestyle more than two and one seconds respectively off his best. Despite defeating Hackett in both races to retain his titles,<ref>{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last = Thomas|title = Aussie Champs: Jones Lowers Breast Mark Again, Thorpe Unhappy With 8th Fastest 200 Free|url= http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/5172.asp|publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date =[[2003-03-24]] |accessdate = 2006-11-20 }}</ref> he later admitted that he was "pretty disappointed" with his performances.

Thorpe arrived for the [[2003 World Aquatics Championships|2003 World Championships]] in [[Barcelona]] for his first major competition since Menzies' appointment under heavy media scrutiny following non-improvement at the Australian Championships. On the first night of competition Thorpe defeated Hackett in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle in a time 2.5&nbsp;s outside his world record,<ref name = "WC2003 1">{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last = Thomas|title = World Champs, Day One Finals: Jenny Thompson Anchors US Women, Popov Anchors Russian Men to Gold in the 400 Free Relay |url= http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/5638.asp|publisher = [[Swimming World Magazine]] |date =[[2003-07-20]] |accessdate = 2006-11-20}}</ref> making him the first to win three world titles in the same event.<ref name="abc career"/> After his relatively slow 400&nbsp;m, he was again under pressure in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle after Van den Hoogenband led at the 100&nbsp;m mark ahead of world record pace.

After his feats at the 2003 World Championships, [[Speedo]] had generated significant media publicity by offering Michael Phelps [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million if he could match Spitz's seven golds. Thorpe was adamant that this was impossible, and scrapped his seventh event, the 200&nbsp;m individual medley from his Olympic program.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 349–350.</ref> In late March [[2004 in sports|2004]] at the Australian Championships in Sydney, Thorpe overbalanced whilst on the blocks in the heats of the 400&nbsp;m freestyle and fell into the water, resulting in his disqualification and ending the defense of his Olympic 400&nbsp;m title.<ref name="abc career"/> This resulted in a large debate among the swimming and public community as to whether Thorpe should be given an exception to Australia's policy of selecting the first and second place getters, with [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] describing the situation as a "tragedy".<ref>{{cite news |first = Mark|last = Bannerman|title = Thorpe's tumble divides nation |url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1076520.htm |publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = [[2004-03-29]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref> Despite the intense media spotlight, Thorpe managed to win the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m freestyle events to ensure his selection for Athens.

[[Image:Ian Thorpe dq.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Thorpe overbalances on the blocks during the heats of the 400&nbsp;m freestyle at the 2004 Australian Championships, resulting in disqualification for causing a false start.]]

The pressure in the lead-up was further compounded by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200&nbsp;m freestyle would be one of the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, Van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as ''The Race of the Century''. With the press spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, resulting in a few terse media events.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 377-380.</ref> Thorpe's increasing focus on the 100&nbsp;m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400&nbsp;m event. Thorpe made a slow start in the final, reaching the 100&nbsp;m mark one second outside world record pace. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, there were multiple changes of lead before Thorpe established a body-length lead by 350&nbsp;m. He was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26&nbsp; in a time three seconds outside his own world record. Thorpe appeared to shed tears in an uncharacteristic sign of emotion, admitting that the controversy surrounding the event had taken a toll on him, but denying that any liquid had left his eyes.<ref>{{cite news |title = Thorpe, Hackett quinella 400&nbsp;m free |url= http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200408/s1176720.htm|publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date =[[2004-08-15]] |accessdate = 2006-11-16}}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 384–388.</ref>

== Style ==

Thorpe's success has been attributed to a work ethic, mental strength, powerful kick, ability to accelerate and having a physiology suited to swimming. This led former Australian head coach [[Don Talbot]] to label him as "the greatest swimmer the world has seen". Although ''Swimming World'' labelled his technique as "extraordinary" and "superior",<ref name="swiminfo tech">{{cite news |title = World Cup VIII: German Coach Accuses Thorpe of Doping |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/1192.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[2000-02-03]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref> Talbot disagreed, stating his belief that Thorpe has placed too much of the workload on his kick at the expense of his arms. Talbot also cited Thorpe's ability to manage his workload and his day-to-day recovery between races during a meet, which he believed was deficient.<ref>Talbot (2003), pp. 221–229.</ref> He was known for his trademark six-beat kick to power away to victory in the closing stages of races, attributed to his unusually large [[shoe size|size 17]] feet.<ref name = "ABC profile"/><ref>{{cite news | first=Christopher|last=Clarey|title=Ian Thorpe, Australian hero, throws in the towel | date=[[2006-11-21]] |accessdate = 2007-04-26 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/21/sports/SWIM.php|publisher =[[International Herald Tribune]]}}</ref>

Following his retirement, head coach of the US men's swimming team [[Bob Bowman (coach)|Bob Bowman]], who coaches [[Michael Phelps]], stated that Thorpe was "the greatest middle-distance swimmer of all time and he's the greatest relay swimmer I have seen". He also further cited Thorpe's ability to raise the profile of the sport and popularise it, noting that Phelps' public image was itself modelled on Thorpe's. [[Australian Olympic Committee]] president [[John Coates]] stated that "In 50 years from now Australians will still marvel at the feats of Ian Thorpe", paying tribute to his work for the Olympic movement. [[Dawn Fraser]], the first person to win an Olympic event three times, said that Thorpe was the "greatest swimmer in the world as far as freestyle swimming is concerned", lamenting that he would not be attempting a hat-trick of 400&nbsp;m titles.<ref>{{cite news | first=Nicole|last=Jeffery|title=World bids adieu to pool pioneer | date=[[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20799152-2722,00.html|publisher =[[The Australian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Christopher|last=Clarey|title=Ian Thorpe, Australian hero, throws in the towel | date=[[2006-11-21]] |accessdate = 2007-04-26 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/21/sports/SWIM.php|publisher =[[International Herald Tribune]]}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Thorpe is one of the most prominent and popular sportsmen in Australia. Despite competing in a sport where the vast majority of international athletes live below the [[poverty line]], marketing surveys have consistently shown Thorpe to be the most sought-after Australian athlete for sponsorship deals, surpassing [[football (soccer)|footballers]] who compete on a weekly basis in much larger stadia.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. vii-viii.</ref> Aside from his swimsuit sponsor [[Adidas]], Thorpe is sponsored by Australian corporate giants such as [[Qantas]], [[Telstra]] and the [[Seven Network]].<ref name ="magnetic">{{cite news |first = Chloe|last = Saltau|title = The magnetic Mr Thorpe |url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/27/1059244481899.html|publisher = [[The Age]] |date = [[2003-07-28]] |accessdate = 2006-11-16 }}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 90, 140, 168.</ref> In spite of his popularity as an athlete, his demeanour is often described as being quiet and mild-mannered. Known for his long-standing interest in fashion, he serves as an ambassador for [[Giorgio Armani|Armani]],<ref name ="dyk"/> and has his own line of designer jewellery and underwear. Such interests have often led to speculation that Thorpe might be [[homosexuality|homosexual]], with his picture having been featured prominently on gay websites.<ref name ="magnetic"/> In 2002 he finally denied this rumour in a radio interview, asserting that he was [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]]. He added that he was flattered by the rumours, stating that being part of a minority group showed "strength in your character".<ref name="ABC profile"/><ref>{{cite news |first = Jacquelin|last = Magnay|title = Thorpe straight as the line on the bottom of the pool |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/17/1037490052340.html |publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2002-11-18]] |accessdate = 2006-11-10 }}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 318–320.</ref>

Thorpe's interests in fashion and culture resulted in him making frequent visits to [[New York City]] (which he describes as a second home), often for obligations with Armani. He was present at the [[World Trade Center]] the morning of [[September 11, 2001]], having stopped there on his morning jog before returning to his hotel.<ref name ="dyk"/> It was during this September trip that he was invited to be interviewed on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which was notable due to the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America compared to other major sports.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 280–281.</ref> He later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful [[New York City 2012 Olympic bid|New York city bid]] for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], even promising to defer his retirement to compete in 2012, if New York were to be successful.<ref>{{cite news |first = Jacquelin|last = Magnay|title = Ian Thorpe 'to rescue NY Olympic dream' |url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/ian-thorpe-to-rescue-ny-olympic-dream/2005/07/04/1120329384268.html |publisher = [[The Age]] |date = 2005-07-05 |accessdate = 2006-11-10 }}</ref> Thorpe's interests have also seen him involved in television, starring in a reality television show in [[2002 in television|2002]] called ''[[Undercover Angels]]'', which imitated the ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' series. The show involved Thorpe directing three young women who performed good deeds for people in need. Although it attracted more than a million viewers, it was widely panned by critics.<ref name ="magnetic"><ref>Hunter (2004), p. 294–295.</ref> He has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom ''[[Friends]]''.<ref name ="dyk"/><ref>Hunter (2004), p. 244.</ref>

Thorpe is widely popular in [[Asia]], and [[Japan]] in particular. He was identified in 2000 by [[TV Asahi]] as the swimmer likely to be the most successful at the forthcoming 2001 Fukuoka World Championships, and was selected to be its marketing figurehead. He visited Japan before the Championships to promote Asahi in a series of television events,<ref name="gsiprofile"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 236, 249, 257–260.</ref> and upon his return for the competition itself, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25&nbsp;m deep, with hundreds camping outside the Australian team hotel. He was also praised by older sections of Japanese society as a role model for youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic.<ref name ="magnetic"><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 264–265, 275–276.</ref> In 2002, in the wake of the tourism slump after the September 11 terrorist attacks, he agreed to be a tourism ambassador for the [[Australian Tourism Commission]] in Japan. The high-profile campaigning included a meeting with then [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]], resulting in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia which was credited to Thorpe.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 292–293.</ref><ref>{{cite news |first = Paul|last = McIntyre|title = Seafood campaign tests Thorpe's pulling power |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/07/1089000223836.html?from=storylhs |publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2004-07-08]] |accessdate = 2006-11-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last= Hockey | first= Joe| authorlink= Joe Hockey |title=Ian Thorpe - Australia's First Holiday Ambassador in Japan |url = http://minister.industry.gov.au/index.cfm?event=object.showContent&objectID=EDC62CAE-FB97-40EE-B7B30CFAA2CC7A91 |publisher = [[Government of Australia]] |date = [[2002-02-25]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref> In 2005 the [[Yakult]] company in Japan released a 'Thorpedo' energy drink, featuring a picture of Thorpe on the bottle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yakult to sell Ian Thorpe sports drink |url = http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/358607 |publisher = [[Japan Today]]|date=[[2005]] |accessdate = 2006-03-22 }}</ref> This was part of an equity deal with the [[So Natural]] food group in which Thorpe was offered a 5% stake in the company, initially worth A$1.1m, in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers markets across East and Southeast Asia and could expand Thorpe's share in the venture to 50% depending on its commercial success.<ref>{{cite news |first = Paul|last = McIntyre|title = Seafood campaign tests Thorpe's pulling power |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/07/1089000223836.html?from=storylhs   |publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2004-07-08]] |accessdate = 2006-11-16 }}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 350–351.</ref>

More recently, Thorpe has also emerged as a [[philanthropy|philanthropist]], founding the Ian Thorpe's Fountain for youth in 2000.<ref>Hunter (2004), p. 248.</ref> The organization raises funds for research on childhood illnesses and also sponsors a school in [[Beijing]] for orphaned children with disabilities. In addition, it works with [[The Fred Hollows Foundation]] to improve health standards and living conditions in [[Indigenous Australians|Australian aboriginal]] communities.<ref name="gsiprofile"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hollows.org/content/TextOnly.aspx?s=168|title= Jeff McMullen|accessdate=2006-11-16 |work= The Fred Hollows Foundation}}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp. 331–333.</ref>

On [[July 7]], [[2007 in music|2007]], Thorpe was one of the presenters at the [[Live Earth concert, Sydney|Australian leg]] of the [[Live Earth]] concert.
