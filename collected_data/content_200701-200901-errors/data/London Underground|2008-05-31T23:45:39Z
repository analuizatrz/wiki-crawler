The '''London Underground''' is a [[metro system]] serving a large part of [[Greater London]] and neighbouring areas of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Buckinghamshire]] in England. It is the world's oldest underground railway system. Services began on [[10 January]] [[1863]] on the [[Metropolitan Railway]].<ref name="history">{{ cite web | title = History | publisher = Transport for London | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1604.aspx | accessdate = 2007-03-31 }}</ref> Despite its name, about 55% of the network is above ground. It is commonly called ''the Underground'' and ''the Tube'' from the  shape of the system's [[Tunnel#Tunnel Boring Machine|deep-bore tunnel]]s.

The earlier lines of the present London Underground system, built by various companies, became part of an integrated passenger transport system (which excluded the main line railways) in 1933 under the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB). The underground network became a separate entity when London Underground Limited (LUL) was set up by the [[UK government]] in 1985.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1604.aspx History | Transport for London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since 2003 LUL has been a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Transport for London]] (TfL), the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in [[Greater London]], which is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].<ref>TFL London Underground history|http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of the London Underground}}

Railway construction in the [[United Kingdom]] began in the early [[19th century]]. By 1850 six separate railway termini had been built just outside the centre of London: [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]], [[Euston railway station|Euston]], [[London Paddington station|Paddington]], [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], [[Bishopsgate railway station|Bishopsgate]], [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]]. Only [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street station]] was located in the [[City of London]] itself. Traffic congestion in London had increased in this period, partly due to the need for rail travellers to complete their journeys into the city centre by road. An underground railway to link the City of London with the mainline termini was first proposed in the 1830s, but it was not until the 1850s that the idea was taken seriously as a solution to the traffic congestion problems.<ref>''The London Underground - An illustrated history'', Oliver Green, pp.3-4 (Ian Allen Ltd., 1987)</ref>

===The first underground railways===
In 1854 an [[Act of Parliament]] was passed approving the construction of an underground railway between [[Paddington Station]] and [[Farringdon station|Farringdon Street]] via [[King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], which was to be called the [[Metropolitan Railway]]. This was to be built with the support of the [[Great Western Railway]], who helped fund the project on the grounds that a junction would be built with their mainline terminus at [[Paddington]]. However construction did not begin until February 1860 due to financial problems. The fact that this project got underway at all was largely due to the lobbying of [[Charles Pearson]], who was [[Solicitor]] to the [[City of London]] at the time. In 1859 he finally persuaded the [[City of London Corporation]] to help fund the scheme.

The Metropolitan was opened to the public on [[January 10]] [[1863]].<ref name="history"/> It was the world's first urban underground passenger-carrying railway. Within a few months of opening it was carrying over 26,000 passengers a day.<ref>''The London Underground - An illustrated history'', Oliver Green, p.5 (Ian Allen Ltd., 1987)</ref>. A year later the line was extended to [[Hammersmith tube station (Hammersmith & City Line)|Hammersmith]] in the west and a year after that it was extended to [[Moorgate tube station|Moorgate]] in the east. Most of this original route is now part of the [[Hammersmith and City Line]]. Later in the decade other branches were opened to [[Swiss Cottage tube station|Swiss Cottage]], [[South Kensington tube station|South Kensington]] and Addison Road, Kensington (now known as [[Kensington Olympia station|Kensington Olympia]]).

On [[December 24]] [[1868]], the [[Metropolitan District Railway]] began operating services between [[South Kensington tube station|South Kensington]] and [[Westminster tube station|Westminster]] using Metropolitan Railway trains and carriages. The company, which soon became known as "the District", was first incorporated in 1864 to complete an Inner Circle railway around [[London]] in conjunction with the Metropolitan. This was part of a plan to build both an Inner Circle line and Outer Circle line around London. 

The Metropolitan and the District were initially friendly to each other. They shared four directors and the two companies were widely expected to merge once the Inner Circle was completed. However a fierce rivalry soon developed when the independent directors on the District board became disattisfied with the performance of the Metropolitan service providers. On 3 January 1870 the Metropolitan informed the District that operating agreements would cease in 18 months. The four Metropolitan directors serving on the District board subsequently resigned. This severely delayed the completion of the Inner Circle project as the two companies competed to build far more financially lucrative railways in the suburbs of London. In 1870 the District completed its route between [[West Brompton station|West Brompton]] and [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]], with an interchange with the Metropolitan at South Kensington. Over the decade the Metropolitan was extended to [[Harrow tube station|Harrow]] in the north-west whilst the District was extended to [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing]], [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]] and [[Fulham]] in the west and south-west. The Inner Circle was finally completed in 1884. Attempts were made to establish an [[Outer Circle (London)|Outer Circle]] route, but this idea was later dropped. Due to the rivalry that ensued between the Metropolitan and the District, the Inner Circle was not operated as a single service until the full integration of London's underground railways in the 1930s. The railway was renamed the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] in 1949.

The early tunnels were dug mainly using [[cut-and-cover]] construction methods. This caused widespread disruption and required the demolition of several properties on the surface. The first trains were steam-hauled, which required effective ventilation to the surface. Ventilation shafts at various points on the route allowed the engines to expel steam and bring fresh air into the tunnels. One such vent is at Leinster Gardens, W2.<ref>{{cite web

</ref>  In order to preserve the visual characteristics in what is still a well-to-do street, a five-foot-thick (1.5&nbsp;m) concrete façade was constructed to resemble a genuine house frontage.

On [[December 7]] [[1869]] the [[East London Railway]] started operating services between [[Wapping tube station|Wapping]] and [[New Cross Gate station|New Cross Gate]] (then known as New Cross) using the [[Thames Tunnel]] designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. This had originally opened in 1843 as a pedestrian tunnel, but it was purchased by the [[East London Railway]] in 1865 and it was converted into a railway tunnel. 

By the end of the 1880s, underground railway services reached [[Chesham tube station|Chesham]] on the Metropolitan, [[Hounslow tube station|Hounslow]] and [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] on the District and [[Shoreditch tube station|Shoreditch]] and [[New Cross station|New Cross]] on the East London Railway. By the end of the 19th century, the Metropolitan had extended its lines far outside of London to [[Aylesbury Station|Aylesbury]], [[Verney Junction]] and [[Brill Tramway|Brill]], creating new suburbs along the route. Right up until the 1930s the company pursued ambitions to maintain the railway as a main-line operation rather than a rapid transit service.

===The first tube lines===
[[Image:Gb-lu-Angel-southbound.jpg|thumb|left|The nickname "the Tube" comes from the circular tube-like tunnels and platforms through which the trains travel. This photograph shows the southbound station platform at [[Angel tube station]] on the [[Northern Line]].]]

Following advances in the use of [[tunnelling shield]]s, electric traction and deep-level tunnel designs, later railways were built further underground. This caused far less disruption at ground level than the cut-and-cover construction method. It was therefore cheaper and preferable. 

The [[City & South London Railway]] (C&SLR, now part of the [[Northern Line]]) opened in 1890, between [[Stockwell tube station|Stockwell]] and King William Street (Now [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank and Monument]]). It was the first "deep-level" electrically operated railway in the world. By 1900 it had been extended at both ends, to [[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]] in the south and Moorgate Street (via a diversion) in the north. The second such railway, the [[Waterloo and City Line|Waterloo and City Railway]], opened in 1898. It was built and run by the [[London and South Western Railway]] and subsequently it was not incorporated into the Underground when the rival companies began to integrate their services in the 1900s. 

On [[July 30]] [[1900]] the [[Central Line|Central London Railway]] (now known as the [[Central Line]]) was opened, operating services from Bank to Shepherd's Bush. It was nicknamed the "Twopenny Tube" for its flat fare and cylindrical tunnels; the "tube" nickname was eventually transferred to the Underground system as a whole. An interchange with the C&SLR was provided at Bank. Construction had also begun in August 1898 on another line, the [[Baker Street & Waterloo Railway]]. However work on this railway came to a halt eighteen months after it began when funds ran out.

===Into the 20th century===
In the early 20th century, the presence of six independent operators running different Underground lines caused passengers substantial inconvenience; in many places passengers had to walk some distance above ground to change between lines. The costs associated with running such a system were also heavy, and as a result many companies looked to financiers who could give them the money they needed to expand into the lucrative suburbs as well as electrify the earlier steam operated lines. The most prominent of these was [[Charles Yerkes]], an American [[tycoon]] who during 1900 and 1902 acquired the District and the as yet unbuilt [[Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway]] (later to become part of the [[Northern Line]]). 

Yerkes also acquired the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway (jointly to become the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway]], the core of the modern [[Piccadilly Line]]) and the moribund Baker Street & Waterloo Railway to form [[Underground Electric Railways Company|Underground Electric Railways of London Company Ltd]] (UERL) on [[April 9]] [[1902]]. That company also owned three tramway companies and went on to buy the [[London General Omnibus Company]], creating an organisation colloquially known as "the Combine". 

Before those schemes were implemented the independent Great Northern & City Railway opened in 1904 between [[Finsbury Park tube station|Finsbury Park]] and [[Moorgate tube station|Moorgate]]. It was the only tube line of sufficient diameter to be capable of handling main-line sized stock, but remained separate from the main line network. It was bought out by the Metropolitan in 1913.

By 1904 the District had opened its [[South Harrow tube station|South Harrow]] branch and the MetR opened its [[Uxbridge tube station|Uxbridge]] branch. In 1905 most of the lines of the Metropolitan and District were finally electrified. District railway trains eventually reached Uxbridge when the link to the Metropolitan at [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane]] was completed in 1910.

The Baker Street & Waterloo Railway opened in 1906, soon rebadging itself the [[Bakerloo Line|Bakerloo]], and by 1907 had been extended to [[Edgware Road tube station|Edgware Road]] in the north and [[Elephant & Castle tube station|Elephant & Castle]] in the south. The Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton also opened in 1907 between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith; the single station branch to Strand (later Aldwych) opened in 1907. The Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR) opened in 1907 from [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]] to [[Camden Town tube station|Camden Town]], with two northward branches, one to [[Golders Green tube station|Golders Green]], one to [[Highgate tube station|Highgate]] (now Archway). 

By 1907 the C&SLR had been extended northwards to [[Euston tube station|Euston]], making an interchange there with the CCE&HR, and with main lines at Kings Cross, St Pancras and Euston.

In early 1908 the underground railway operators agreed to promote their services jointly as "the Underground", creating a free publicity map of the network in the process. New station signs and ticketing arrangements were also put into place.

===The 1910s and 1920s===
On [[1 January]] [[1913]] the UERL absorbed two other independent tube lines, the [[City & South London Railway]] (now part of the Northern line) and the [[Central London Railway]]. 

As the monopoly of the Combine asserted itself, only the [[Metropolitan Railway]] stayed away from this process of integration, retaining pretensions of being considered to be a main-line railway. Proposals were put forward for a merger between the two companies in 1913 but the plan was rejected by the Metropolitan.

The Bakerloo line extension to [[Queen's Park tube station|Queen's Park]] was completed in 1915, and the service extended to [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]] via the [[London and North Western Railway]] tracks in 1917. The extension of the Central line to [[Ealing Broadway tube station|Ealing Broadway]] was delayed by the war to 1920.

The major development of the 1920s was the integration of the CCE&HR and the C&SLR and extensions to form what was to become the Northern line. This necessitated enlargement of the older parts of the C&SLR, requiring temporary closures, during 1922—24. The [[Golders Green tube station|Golders Green]] branch was extended to [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] in 1924, and the southern end was extended to [[Morden tube station|Morden]] in 1926.

The [[Watford tube station|Watford]] branch of the Metropolitan was opened in 1925.

===The 1930s and 1940s===
The Metropolitan opened its branch to [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]] in 1932. This and the realigned Metropolitan slow lines between [[Finchley Road tube station|Finchley Road]] and [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]] were taken over in 1939 by the [[Bakerloo Line|Bakerloo]], itself extended in new deep-level tunnels from [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] to Finchley Road (in turn the Jubilee line took over these lines in 1979).

The last major extensions applied by the Combine were to the Piccadilly line. By 1933 the [[Cockfosters tube station|Cockfosters]] branch was complete, and at the western end through services were running (via realigned tracks between [[Hammersmith tube station|Hammersmith]] and [[Acton Town tube station|Acton Town]]) to [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow West]] and [[Uxbridge tube station|Uxbridge]].

In 1933 the Combine, the Metropolitan and all the municipal and independent bus and tram undertakings were merged into the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), a self-supporting and unsubsidised public corporation which came into being on [[1 July]] [[1933]]. The LPTB soon became more widely known as "London Transport" (LT), its shortened title.

London Transport set in motion a scheme for the expansion of the network, the 1935–1940 [[New Works Programme]]. This consisted of plans to extend some lines, to take over the operation of others from the main-line railway companies, and to electrify the entire network. During the 1930s and 1940s, several sections of main-line railway were converted into (surface) lines of the Underground. The oldest part of today's Underground network is the Central line between [[Leyton tube station|Leyton]] and [[Loughton tube station|Loughton]], which opened as a railway seven years before the Underground itself.

The outbreak of [[World War II]] delayed all these schemes. From mid-1940, the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] led to the use of many Underground stations as [[air-raid shelter|shelters]] during [[air raid]]s and overnight. The authorities initially tried to prevent this, but later supplied [[bunk]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[catering]] facilities. Later in the war, eight [[London deep-level shelters]] were constructed under stations, ostensibly to be used as shelters (each deep-level shelter could hold 8,000 people) though plans were in place to convert them for a new express line parallel to the Northern line after the war. Some stations (now mostly disused) were converted into government offices: for example, [[Down Street tube station|Down Street]] was used for the headquarters of the Railway Executive Committee and was also used for meetings of the [[War Cabinet]] before the [[Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms|Cabinet War Rooms]] were completed;<ref name=Disused_1>
{{cite book |last=Conner|first=J.E.|title=London's Disused Underground Stations|year=1999|publisher=Capital Transport|chapter=Down Street|pages=p. 33|isbn=185414-250-X}}</ref> [[Brompton Road tube station|Brompton Road]] was used as a control room for [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and the remains of the surface building are still used by London's University Royal Naval Unit (URNU) and University London Air Squadron (ULAS).

===Post-war developments===
[[Image:TubeStationWithTrain.jpg|thumb||A [[London Underground 1995 Stock]] train pulls into [[Mornington Crescent tube station|Mornington Crescent]] station on the [[Northern Line]].]]
On [[1 January]] [[1948]] London Transport was [[nationalised]] by the incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government and incorporated into the operations of the [[British Transport Commission]] (BTC). The LTPB was replaced by the [[London Transport Executive]].

One of the last acts of the LTPB was the go-ahead for the completion of the postponed Central line extensions. The western extension to [[West Ruislip tube station|West Ruislip]] was completed in 1948, and the eastern extension to [[Epping tube station|Epping]] in 1949; the single-line branch from Epping to Ongar was taken over and electrified  in 1957, it was abandoned in 1994.

The BTC prioritised the reconstruction of its main-line railways, which had also been nationalised, over the maintenance of the Underground. Although it committed itself to the completion of the [[New Works Programme]], many of the original plans were shelved. However the BTC did authorise the completion of the electrification of the network, seeking to replace steam locomotives on the parts of the system where they still operated. This phase of the programme was completed when the [[Metropolitan Line]] was electrified to [[Chesham tube station|Chesham]] in 1960. Steam locomotives were fully withdrawn from London Underground passenger services on [[9 September]] [[1961]] - when [[British Railways]] took over the operations of the Metropolitan line between [[Amersham tube station|Amersham]] and [[Aylesbury railway station|Aylesbury]]. 

In 1963 the London Transport Executive was replaced by the [[London Transport Board]], directly accountable to the [[Ministry of Transport]]. On [[1 January]] [[1970]], the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) took over responsibility for London Transport. 

The first real post-war investment in the network came with the carefully planned [[Victoria Line]], which was built on a diagonal northeast-southwest alignment beneath [[Central London]], incorporating centralised signalling control and automatically driven trains which opened in stages between 1968 and 1971. The Piccadilly line was extended to [[Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 tube station|Heathrow Airport]] in 1977, and the Jubilee line was opened in 1979, taking over part of the Bakerloo line, with new tunnels between [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] and [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]]. 

In 1984, [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government removed London Transport from the GLC's control, replacing it with [[London Regional Transport]] (LRT) - a statutory corporation for which the [[Secretary of State for Transport]] was directly responsible. The government planned to modernise the system whilst slashing its subsidy from taxpayers and ratepayers at the same time. As part of this strategy London Underground Limited was set up in 1985, as a wholly owned subsidiary of LRT, to run the network on LRT's behalf. This period saw the introduction of automatic ticketing machines and network-wide [[Travelcard]]s. In 1994, with the [[privatization|privatisation]] of [[British Rail]], LRT took control of the Waterloo and City line, incorporating it into the Underground network for the first time. In 1999 the Jubilee line extension to [[Stratford station|Stratford]] in London's East End was begun. This plan included the opening of a completely refurbished interchange station at [[Westminster tube station|Westminster]]. The Jubilee line's old terminal platforms at Charing Cross were abandoned but maintained operable for emergencies.

===Into the 21st century===
Transport for London (TfL) replaced LRT in 2000, a development that coincided with the creation of a directly elected Mayor of London and the [[Greater London Assembly]]. 

In January 2003 the Underground began operating as a [[Public-Private Partnership]] (PPP), whereby the infrastructure and rolling stock were maintained by two private companies ([[Metronet]] and [[Tube Lines]]) under 30-year contracts, whilst London Underground Limited remained publicly owned and operated by TfL.

There was much controversy over the implementation of the PPP. Supporters of the change claimed that the private sector would eliminate the inefficiencies of public sector enterprises and take on the risks associated with running the network, while opponents said that the need to make profits would reduce the investment and public service aspects of the Underground. There has since been criticism of the performance of the private companies; for example the January 2007 edition of [[The Londoner]],<ref>

http://www.metronetrail.com/default.asp?sID=1184745625515</ref> TfL has taken over Metronet's outstanding commitments. 

The [[UK government]] has made concerted efforts to find another private firm to fill the vacuum left by the liquidation of [[Metronet]]. However only TfL has expressed a viable interest in taking over Metronet's responsibilities so far. Even though [[Tube Lines]] appears to be stable, this has put the long-term future of the PPP scheme in doubt. The case for PPP was also weakened in 2008 when it was revealed that the demise of Metronet had cost the UK government £2 billion. The five private companies that made up the Metronet alliance had to pay £70m each towards paying off the debts acquired by the consortium. But due to a deal struck with the government in 2003, when the PPP scheme began operating, the companies were protected from any further liability. The UK taxpayer therefore had to foot the rest of the bill. This undermined the argument that the PPP would place the risks involved in running the network into the hands of the private sector.<ref>''Railway Magazine'', April 2008 issue, p.6</ref>

==Transport for London==
{{main|Transport for London}}
Transport for London (TfL) was created in 2000 as the integrated body responsible for London's transport system. It replaced London Regional Transport. It assumed control of London Underground Limited in July 2003.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#tube Greater London Authority - Frequently Asked Questions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

TfL is part of the [[Greater London Authority]] and is constituted as a statutory corporation regulated under local government finance rules.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/4510.aspx Company information | Transport for London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It has three subsidiaries: London Transport Insurance Guernsey Ltd, the TfL Pension Fund Trustee Company and Transport Trading Ltd (TTL). TTL has six wholly-owned subsidiaries, one of which is London Underground Limited.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/boardandchiefofficers/1452.aspx TfL subsidiaries | Transport for London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The TfL Board is appointed by the [[Mayor of London]]. The Mayor also sets the structure and level of public transport fares in London. However the day-to-day running of the corporation is left to the [[Commissioner]] of Transport for London, who is currently [[Peter Hendy]]. The first Mayor of London, [[Ken Livingstone]], chose to chair the TfL Board himself. His successor, [[Boris Johnson]], has nominated Tim Parker for the task, subject to the approval of the Greater London Assembly.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=17034 Greater London Authority - Press Release<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Mayor is responsible for producing an integrated transport strategy for London and for consulting the GLA, TfL, local councils and others on the strategy. The Mayor is also responsible for setting TfL's budget. The GLA is consulted on the Mayor's transport strategy, and inspects and approves the Mayor's budget. It is able to summon the Mayor and senior staff to account for TfL's performance. London TravelWatch, a body appointed by and reporting to the Assembly, deals with complaints about transport in London.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/transport.jsp Greater London Authority - Transport<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Infrastructure==
{{main|London Underground infrastructure}}
===Stations and lines===
The London Underground's 11 lines are the [[Bakerloo line]], [[Central line]], [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]], [[District line]], [[Hammersmith & City line]], [[Jubilee line]], [[Metropolitan line]], [[Northern line]], [[Piccadilly line]], [[Victoria line]], and [[Waterloo & City line]].  Until 2007 there was a twelfth line, the [[East London line]], but this has closed for conversion work and will be transferred to the [[London Overground]] when it reopens in 2010. 

The Underground serves 268 [[Underground station|stations]] by rail; an additional six stations that were on the East London line are currently served by Underground replacement buses. Fourteen Underground stations are outside Greater London, of which five ([[Amersham station|Amersham]], [[Chalfont & Latimer station|Chalfont & Latimer]], [[Chesham tube station|Chesham]], [[Chorleywood station|Chorleywood]], [[Epping tube station|Epping]]) are beyond the [[M25 motorway|M25 London Orbital motorway]]. Of the 32 [[London borough]]s, six ([[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] and [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]) are not served by the Underground network. 

[[Image:London Underground Zone 1.svg|center|600px|thumb|Zone 1 (central zone) of the Underground (and [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]]) network in a geographically more accurate layout than the usual Tube map, using the same style. Part of the East London line is shown at right as it existed until 2007.]]

[[Image:London Underground subsurface and tube trains.jpg|thumb|Underground trains come in two sizes, larger subsurface trains and smaller tube trains. A [[Metropolitan line]] [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|A Stock]] train (left) passes a [[Piccadilly line]] [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] train (right) in the siding at [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane]]]]

Lines on the Underground can be classified into two types: subsurface and deep-level. The subsurface lines were dug by the [[cut-and-cover]] method, with the tracks running about {{convert|5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} below the surface. The deep-level or tube lines, bored using a [[tunnelling shield]], run about {{convert|20|m|ftin|abbr=on}} below the surface (although this varies considerably), with each track in a separate tunnel. These tunnels can have a diameter as small as {{convert|3.56|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and the [[loading gauge]] is thus considerably smaller than on the subsurface lines. Lines of both types usually emerge onto the surface outside the central area.

While the tube lines are for the most part self-contained, the subsurface lines are part of an interconnected network: Each shares track with at least two other lines. The subsurface arrangement is somewhat similar to the [[New York City Subway]], which also runs separate "lines" over shared tracks.

===Rolling stock and electrification===

Stock on subsurface lines is identified by a letter (such as [[London Underground A62 Stock|A Stock]], used on the [[Metropolitan line]]), while tube stock is identified by the year in which it was designed (for example, [[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996 Stock]], used on the Jubilee line). All lines are worked by a single type of stock except the [[District line]], which uses both [[London Underground C69 Stock|C]] and [[London Underground D78 Stock|D]] Stock. Two types of stock are currently being developed &mdash; [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 Stock]] for the Victoria line and [[London Underground S Stock|S stock]] for the subsurface lines, with the Metropolitan line A Stock being replaced first. Rollout of both is expected to begin about 2009. In addition to the [[Electric Multiple Unit]]s described above, there are [[London Underground engineering stock|Engineering Stock]], such as ballast trains and brake vans. They are identified by a 1-3 letter prefix, then a number. 

The Underground is one of the few networks in the world that uses a four-rail system. The additional rail carries the electrical return that on third-rail and overhead networks is provided by the running rails. On the Underground a top-contact third rail is beside the track, energised at +420 V DC, and a top-contact fourth rail is centrally between the running rails, at -210 V DC, which combine to provide a traction voltage of 630 V DC.

===Cooling===
{{main|London Underground cooling}}
In summer, temperatures on parts of the '''[[London Underground]]''' can become very uncomfortable due to its deep and poorly ventilated tube tunnels: temperatures as high as {{convert|47|°C|°F}} were reported in the [[2006 European heat wave]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5191604.stm|title=Baking hot at Baker Street|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Posters may be observed on the Underground network advising that passengers carry a bottle of water to help keep cool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/anniemole/166070278/|title=Carry a bottle of water TfL poster}}</ref>

===Planned improvements===
[[Image:Piccadilly T5 Extension.JPG|thumb|A diagram at [[Ealing Common tube station|Ealing Common]], showing the layout of the [[Piccadilly line]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]]]]
There are many planned improvements to the London Underground. A new station opened on the Piccadilly line at [[Heathrow Terminal 5 station|Heathrow Airport Terminal 5]] on [[27 March]] [[2008]] and is the first extension of the London Underground since 1999.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/5507.aspx First Piccadilly line trains travel to Heathrow Terminal 5]</ref><ref>London Underground.  [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/metro/article.asp?id=1206 Piccadilly line update.] ([[21 August]] [[2006]]). Retrieved [[3 December]] [[2006]].</ref> Each line is being upgraded to improve capacity and reliability, with new computerised signalling, [[automatic train operation]] (ATO), track replacement and station refurbishment, and, where needed, new rolling stock. A trial program for a groundwater cooling system in [[Victoria station (London)|Victoria station]] took place in 2006 and 2007; it aimed to determine whether such a system would be feasible and effective if in widespread use.<ref>{{cite web

The long proposed [[Chelsea-Hackney line]] which is planned to begin operation in 2025, may be part of the London Underground, which would mean it would give the network a new Northeast to South cross London line to provide more interchanges with other lines and relieve overcrowding on other lines. However it is still on the drawing board. It was first proposed in 1901 and has been in planning since then. In 2007 the line was passed over to Cross London Rail Ltd the current developers of Crossrail therefore the line may be either part of the London Underground network or the National Rail network. There are advantages and disadvantages for both.

==Traveling==
===Ticketing===
{{main|London Underground ticketing}}
[[Image:London-underground-travelcard.jpg|thumb|London Underground One-Day Travelcard]]
[[Image:Oyster card front small.png|thumb|London Underground Oyster Card]]
The Underground uses TfL's [[Travelcard]] zones to calculate fares. Greater London is divided into 6 zones; [[Travelcard Zone 1|Zone 1]] is the most central, with a boundary just beyond the Circle line, and [[Travelcard Zone 6|Zone 6]] is the outermost and includes [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Stations on the Metropolitan line outside Greater London are in Zones 7-9.<ref>
{{cite web
  | title =Numbered zones for stations
  | publisher =[[Watford Observer]]
  | url =http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1855280.mostviewed.numbered_zones_for_stations.php
  | accessdate =2007-11-24  }}</ref>

Travelcard zones 7-9 also apply on the Euston-Watford Junction line (part of the London Overground).  With Watford High Street being within the zones, but as of April 2008, Watford Junction is outside of these zones and therefore a special fare applies.

There are staffed ticket offices, some open for limited periods only, and ticket machines usable at any time. Some machines that sell a limited range of tickets accept coins only, other touch-screen machines accept coins and banknotes, and usually give change. These machines also accept major credit and debit cards: some newer machines accept cards only. 

More recently, TfL has introduced the [[Oyster card]], a [[smartcard]] with an embedded contactless [[RFID]] chip, that travellers can obtain, charge with credit, and use to pay for travel. Like Travelcards they can be used on the Underground, buses, trams and the Docklands Light Railway. The Oyster card is cheaper to operate than cash ticketing or the older-style magnetic-strip-based Travelcards{{Specify|date=December 2006}}, and the Underground is encouraging passengers to use Oyster cards instead of Travelcards and cash (on buses) by implementing significant price differences. Oyster-based Travelcards can be used on National Rail throughout London. Pay as you go is available on a restricted, but increasing, [[Oyster card (pay as you go) on National Rail|number of routes]].<ref>

====Penalty fares and fare evasion====
In addition to automatic and staffed ticket gates, the Underground is patrolled by both uniformed and plain-clothes ticket inspectors with hand-held [[Oyster card]] readers. Passengers travelling without a ticket valid for their entire journey are required to pay at least a £20 [[penalty fare]] and can be prosecuted for fare evasion under the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1889]] under which they are subject to a fine of up to £1,000, or three months' imprisonment. [[Oyster card|Oyster]] pre-pay users who have failed to 'touch in' at the start of their journey are charged the 'maximum cash fare' (£4, or £5 at some [[National Rail]] stations) upon 'touching out'. In addition, an Oyster card user who has failed to touch in at the start of their journey and who is detected mid-journey (''i.e.'' on a train) by an Inspector is now liable to a penalty fare of £20. No £4 maximum charge will be applied at their destination as the inspector will apply an 'exit token' to their card.

It should be noted that whilst the Conditions of Carriage require period Travelcard holders to touch-in and touch-out at the start and end of their journey, any Oystercard user who has a valid period Travelcard covering their entire journey is not liable to pay a Penalty fare where they have not touched-in. Neither the Conditions of Carriage or Schedule 17 of the [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]], which shows how and when Penalty fares can be issued, would allow the issuing of a Penalty fare to a traveller who had already paid the correct fare for their journey.

===Delays===
According to statistics obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act]], the average commuter on the Metropolitan line wasted three days, 10 hours and 25 minutes in 2006 due to delays (not including missed connections).<ref>

===Hours of operation===
The Underground does not run 24 hours a day, (except for at New Year and on major public events - such as the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the Opening and Closing ceremony of the [[London Olympics]] in 2012) because the majority of lines have only two tracks (one in each direction) and therefore need to close at night for planned maintenance work. First trains on the network start operating around 04:30, running until around 01:30. Unlike systems such as the [[New York City Subway]], few parts of the Underground have express tracks that would allow trains to be routed around maintenance sites. Recently, greater use has been made of weekend closures of parts of the system for scheduled engineering work.

===Accessibility===
[[Accessibility]] by people with mobility issues was not considered when most of the system was built, and most older stations are inaccessible to disabled people. More recent stations were designed for accessibility, but [[retrofit]]ting accessibility features to old stations is at best prohibitively expensive and technically extremely difficult, and often impossible. Even when there are already [[escalators]] or [[Elevator|lift]]s, there are often steps between the lift or escalator landings and the platforms.

Most stations on the surface have at least a short flight of stairs to gain access from street level, and the great majority of below-ground stations require use of stairs or some of the system's 410 [[escalator]]s (each going at a speed of {{convert|145|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} per minute, approximately {{convert|1.65|mph|0|abbr=on}}). There are also some lengthy walks and further flights of steps required to gain access to platforms. The station at [[Covent Garden tube station|Covent Garden]] has the equivalent of 15 storeys of steps to reach the exit, so an announcement is made for passengers to queue for a lift, as walking the steps can be dangerous.

The escalators in Underground stations include some of the longest in Europe, and all are custom-built. The longest escalator is at [[Angel tube station|Angel station]], {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, with a vertical rise of {{convert|27.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="facts"/> They run 20 hours a day, 364 days a year, with 95% of them operational at any one time, and can cope with 13,000 passengers per hour. Convention and signage stipulate that people using escalators on the Underground ''stand'' on the right-hand side so as not to obstruct those who ''walk'' past them on the left.

TfL produces a map indicating which stations are accessible, and since 2004 line maps indicate with a [[wheelchair]] symbol those stations that provide step-free access from street level. Step height from platform to train is up to {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and there can be a large gap between the train and curved platforms. Only the [[Jubilee Line Extension]] is completely accessible.

TfL plans that by 2020 there should be a network of over 100 fully accessible stations, consists of those recently built or rebuilt, and a handful of suburban stations that happen to have level access, along with selected 'key stations', which will be rebuilt. These key stations have been chosen due to high usage, interchange potential, and geographic spread, so that up to 75% of journeys will be achievable step-free.<ref>

===Overcrowding===
Overcrowding on the Underground has been of concern, particularly at [[Camden Town tube station|Camden Town station]] and [[Covent Garden tube station|Covent Garden]], which merit access restrictions at certain times<ref>{{cite web
  | title = Tube Map
  | publisher =[[TfL]]
  | url =http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/Standard-Tube-map.pdf
  | accessdate = 2008-04-04
}}</ref>. Restrictions are introduced at other stations when necessary. Several stations have been rebuilt to deal with overcrowding issues, with Clapham Common and Clapham North on the Northern line being the last remaining stations with a single narrow platform with tracks on both sides. At particularly busy occasions, such as [[Soccer|football]] matches, [[British Transport Police]] may be present to help with overcrowding.
On [[24 September]] [[2007]], King's Cross underground station was totally closed due to "overcrowding". According to a 2003 House of Commons report,<ref>{{cite news

===Safety===
{{split-section}}
[[Image:Westminster underground.JPG|thumb|[[Westminster tube station|Westminster station]] &mdash; extensive structures are required to support [[Portcullis House]] above.]]
[[London Underground accidents|Accidents on the Underground network]], which carries around a billion passengers a year, are rare.   There is just one fatal accident for every 300 million journeys.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/research/backgrounders/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2155915 Safety first.] ''[[The Economist]]'' ([[23 October]], [[2003]]) Retrieved [[3 December]], [[2006]].</ref> There are several [[safety]] warnings given to passengers, such as the traditional '[[mind the gap]]' announcement and the regular announcements for passengers to keep behind the yellow line. Relatively few accidents are caused by overcrowding on the platforms, and staff monitor platforms and passageways at busy times prevent people entering the system if they become overcrowded. 

Most fatalities on the network are [[suicide]]s. Most platforms at deep tube stations have pits beneath the track, originally constructed to aid drainage of water from the platforms, but they also help prevent death or serious injury when a passenger falls or jumps in front of a train and aid access to the unfortunate person.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> These pits are officially called "anti-suicide pits", colloquially "suicide pits" or "dead man's trenches". Delays resulting from a person jumping or falling in front of a train as it pulls into a station are announced as an "unfortunate delay", "passenger action", "customer incident" or "a person under a train", and are referred to by staff as a "one under". London Underground has a specialist "Therapy Unit" to deal with drivers' post-traumatic stress, resulting from someone jumping under their train. The Jubilee line extension is the first line to have [[Platform screen doors|platform edge doors]]. These prevent people from falling or jumping onto the tracks, but the main financial justification for their provision was to control station ventilation by restricting the 'piston-effect' of the moving air caused by the trains.

[[London Underground terrorism|Terrorism in the London Underground]] has been a major concern because the Underground's importance makes it a prime target for attacks. Many warnings and several attacks, some successful, have been made on the Underground, [[21 July 2005 London bombings|the most recent]] on the [[21 July]] [[2005]], although in that case only the detonators exploded. The most recent [[7 July 2005 London bombings|attack]] causing damage was on [[7 July]] [[2005]], when three suicide bombers blew themselves up on three trains. The earliest attack on the London Underground was in 1885, when a bomb exploded on a Metropolitan line train at [[Euston Square tube station|Euston Square station]]. The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] (and its predecessors) carried out over ten separate attacks between 1939 and 1993.

[[London Underground air pollution|Air pollution in the London underground]] has been the subject of concern. According to the Discovery Channel documentary, Underground Cities: London, inhaling fumes while travelling on London's Tube for 40 minutes is "the equivalent to smoking two cigarettes", however, the accuracy this information is disputed (see the [[London Underground air pollution|main article]] for more information).  This statement compares the weight of particulate matter that is breathed and not the health effects. Cigarette smoke consists of products of combustion containing oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur; various alkaloids, aromatic hydrocarbons and tar. Dust in the Underground tunnels is mainly iron (from the wheel–rail interface), skin cells, hair cells and clothing fibres (from passengers), and quartz silica (from brakes). Weight for weight, tunnel dust has far less impact on human health than cigarette smoke.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Various regulations aim to improve safety on the Tube. [[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]] was allowed in certain carriages in trains until [[9 July]] [[1984]]. In the middle of 1987 [[smoking ban|smoking was banned]] for a six-month trial period in all parts of the Underground, and the ban was made permanent after the major [[King's Cross fire]] in November 1987.<ref>{{cite web

[[Flash (photography)|Flash photography]] is also forbidden as it may distract drivers and disrupt fire-detection equipment. For the same reason bright auto-focus assist lights should be switched off or covered when photographing in the Underground.

From [[1 June]] [[2008]] it was forbidden to [[alcoholic beverage|drink alcohol]] on the London Underground. This change in policy was made by [[Boris Johnson]] soon after he was elected [[Mayor of London]]. He claims that a public transport drinking ban will reduce crime.<ref>

The Underground's staff safety regimen has drawn criticism. In January 2002 it was fined £225,000 for breaching [[Health and Safety Executive|safety standards for workers]]. In court, the judge reprimanded the company for ''"sacrificing safety"'' to keep trains running ''"at all costs."'' Workers had been instructed to work in the dark with the power rails live, even during rainstorms. Several workers had received electric shocks as a result.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/england/1752928.stm Fine over workers' Tube danger.] ''[[BBC News]]'' ([[10 January]], [[2002]]).

[[Image:Piccadilly Circus Tube Roundel Andh.JPG|thumb|The London Underground roundel, seen here at [[Piccadilly Circus tube station|Piccadilly Circus]], is probably one of the most recognised public transport logos in the world.]]
TfL's [[Tube map]] and "[[roundel]]" [[logo]] are instantly recognisable by any Londoner, almost any Briton, and many people around the world. The original maps were often street maps with the lines superimposed, and the stylised Tube map evolved from a design by electrical engineer [[Harry Beck (graphic designer)|Harry Beck]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref>  Virtually every major urban rail system in the world now has a map in a similar stylised layout and many bus companies have also adopted the concept. TfL licences the sale of clothing and other accessories featuring its graphic elements and it takes legal action against unauthorised use of its trademarks and of the Tube map. Nevertheless, unauthorised copies of the logo continue to crop up worldwide. The phrase "[[mind the gap]]," played when trains stop at certain platforms, has also become a well known catchphrase.

===The roundel===
[[Image:LU Leytonstone sign.jpg|thumb|The use of the roundel with the station name in the blue bar dates from 1908. The roundel seen above can be found at [[Leytonstone tube station]].]]
The origins of the [[roundel]], in earlier years known as the 'bulls-eye' or 'target', are obscure. While the first use of a roundel in a London transport context was the 19th-century symbol of the [[London General Omnibus Company]] — a wheel with a bar across the centre bearing the word '''GENERAL''' —  its usage on the Underground stems from the decision in 1908 to find a more obvious way of highlighting station names on platforms. The red circle with blue name bar was quickly adopted, with the word "U<small>NDERGROUN</small>D" across the bar, as an early corporate identity.<ref>{{cite web
  | title =Logo

  | date =

  | accessdate = }} Not accessible [[2007-01-10]]</ref>  The logo was modified by [[Edward Johnston]] in 1919.

Each station displays the Underground roundel, often containing the station's name in the central bar, at entrances and repeatedly along the platform, so that the name can easily be seen by passengers on arriving trains. 

The roundel has been used for buses and the tube for many years, and since [[Transport for London|TfL]] took control it has been applied to other transport types (taxi, [[Tramlink|tram]], [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]], etc.) in different colour pairs. The roundel has to some extent become a symbol for London itself.

===Typography===
Edward Johnston designed TfL's distinctive [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]], in 1916. "[[Johnston (typeface)|New Johnston]]", modified to include lower case, is still in use. It is noted for the curl at the bottom of the [[minuscule]] ''l'', which other sans-serif typefaces have discarded, and for the diamond-shaped [[tittle]] on the minuscule ''i'' and ''j'', whose shape also appears in the [[full stop]], and is the origin of other punctuation marks in the face. TfL owns the copyright to and exercises control over the New Johnston typeface, but a close approximation of the face exists in the [[TrueType]] computer font ''Paddington'', and the [[Gill Sans]] typeface also takes inspiration from Johnston.

===Contribution to arts===
[[Image:RussellSqTilework.jpg|thumb|An Edwardian tile pattern at [[Russell Square tube station]]]]
The Underground currently sponsors and contributes to the arts via its [[Platform for Art]] and [[Poems on the Underground]] projects. Poster and billboard space (and in the case of [[Gloucester Road tube station]], an entire disused platform) is given over to artwork and poetry to "create an environment for positive impact and to enhance and enrich the journeys of…passengers".<ref>{{cite web

Its artistic legacy includes the employment since the 1920s of many well-known graphic designers, illustrators and artists for its own publicity posters. Designers who produced work for the Underground in the 1920s and 1930s include [[Man Ray]], Edward McKnight Kauffer and [[Fougasse (cartoonist)|Fougasse]]. In recent years the Underground has commissioned work from leading artists including [[R. B. Kitaj]], [[John Bellany]] and [[Howard Hodgkin]].

In architecture, [[Leslie Green]] established a house style for the new stations built in the first decade of the 20th century for the Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Northern lines which included individual Edwardian tile patterns on platform walls.<ref name=edwardiantilepatterns>Many of these tile patterns survive, though a significant number of these are now replicas &ndash; {{ cite web | title = London Underground's Edwardian Tile Patterns | publisher = Doug Rose | url=http://www.dougrose.co.uk/ | accessdate = 2007-07-12 }}</ref> In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Charles Holden]] designed a series of [[modernist]] and [[art-deco]] stations for which the Underground remains famous. Holden's design for the Underground's headquarters building at [[55 Broadway]] included avant-garde sculptures by [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Eric Gill]] and [[Henry Moore]] (his first public commission). The 1990s extension of the Jubilee line featured stations designed by leading architects such as [[Norman Foster]], [[Michael Hopkins]] and [[Will Alsop]].

Many stations also feature unique interior designs to help passenger identification. Often these have themes of local significance. Tiling at [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] incorporates a repeated of [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s silhouette. [[Tottenham Court Road tube station|Tottenham Court Road]] features semi-abstract mosaics by [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] representing the local music industry at [[Denmark Street]]. Northern line platforms at [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]] feature murals by [[David Gentleman]] of the construction of [[Charing Cross]] itself.

===In popular culture===
{{main|London Underground in popular culture}}

The Underground has been featured in many movies and television shows, including ''[[Sliding Doors]]'',  ''[[Tube Tales]]'' and ''[[Neverwhere]]''. The London Underground Film Office handles over 100 requests per month. The Underground has also featured in music such as [[The Jam]]'s "[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]" and in literature such as the graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta]]''. Popular legends about the Underground being haunted persist to this day.<ref>{{ cite web | title = London Underground Ghosts | publisher = BBC h2g2 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A673391 | accessdate = 2007-10-14 }}</ref>
