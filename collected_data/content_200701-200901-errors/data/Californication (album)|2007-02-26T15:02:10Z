'''''Californication''''' is the seventh album by the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released on [[June 8]], [[1999]] (see [[1999 in music]]), with [[John Frusciante]], their former guitarist from the ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' days, returning to the band, replacing [[Dave Navarro]], the former guitarist of the alternative band [[Jane's Addiction]]. With John back in the band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers faced a new musical direction with the albums following. Many fans believe this is the turning point of the band since the ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' days towards a more mature Red Hot Chili Peppers.

"Californication" produced many staple hits for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, such as "[[Around the World (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Around the World]]", "[[Otherside]]", "[[Californication (song)|Californication]]" and the Grammy-award winning "[[Scar Tissue]]". Thanks to an incredible longevity on worldwide chart this is currently their best selling album, peaking at #3 on the Billboard 200 and eventually going on to sell roughly 15 million copies world-wide.

The title "Californication" is mistaken as a [[portmanteau]] between ''[[California]]'' and ''[[fornication]]''. Band member [[Anthony Kiedis]] has mentioned that the album title was chosen for other reasons, and not meant to be related to ''fornication''. In fact, in an MTV interview in 2000, Kiedis said that Californication meant the process in which rock music had started sounding overall more like California rock music, and the process is Californication.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==History==
With the return of [[John Frusciante]] on [[guitar]] (replacing [[Dave Navarro]] of [[Jane's Addiction]]), the Red Hot Chili Peppers managed to regain their critical acceptance after the harshly reviewed ''[[One Hot Minute]]''. Much to the surprise of most industry-watchers, ''Californication'' became the best-selling album in the band's catalogue.

Many of the singles released from the album, such as "Californication", "Around the World", "Otherside", and "Scar Tissue" are now considered fan-favourites. In [[2000]], the song "Scar Tissue" won a Grammy award for best rock song. In 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for ''AOL Sessions'', including former hits "Californication" and "Scar Tissue".

In [[March 2006]], the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums were made available to purchase on [[iTunes]], and not long after, on iTunes' online music sharing rival [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]. Previously unheard tracks were included if the buyer purchased the entire albums, causing many fans to be displeased at the prospect of having to buy an album they already own just to hear these b-side tracks. ''Californication's'' tracks were "Fat Dance", "Over Funk" and "Quixoticelixer". The original tracks, as with all the other re-released albums, are not remastered, leaving only the bonus tracks remastered.

==Musical style==
With an increased number of subdued melodies in place of their signature [[funk]]-[[Rock music|rock]]/[[Heavy metal music|metal]] tracks, ''Californication'' was a departure from the Chili Peppers' previous albums. It dropped both the heavy [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] sound from ''One Hot Minute'' and the dry, stripped-down funk sound of the ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' days. As a whole the album balances&mdash;and on many tracks combines&mdash;both the Chilis' classic signature style ("Get on Top", "I Like Dirt") with their relatively newfound embrace for melodic balladry ("Porcelain", "This Velvet Glove") together. On some tracks, however, the band head into entirely new territory ("Parallel Universe", "Easily"). 

Once again, ever-developing guitarist John Frusciante becomes more experimental with his instrument. One song in particular, "Emit Remmus", features a repeating guitar riff that was deliberately recorded backwards&mdash;hence the title "Emit Remmus", backwards for "Summer Time". Many of the songs are somewhat protest songs, such as the hit single "[[Californication (song)|Californication]]", which attacks the dark side of [[Hollywood]].

==Sound quality==
''Californication'' is often held up as an example of the damage caused by the [[loudness war]]. Almost every second of the album contains digital [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]] noise caused by an overly aggressive application of the [[limiting|soft limiter]] in the [[HDCD]] mastering process. Many audio enthusiasts  and fans alike find the album unlistenable without applying sophisticated clip restoration algorithms to the tracks. There is an unmastered version of the album circulating which sounds noticeably more natural than the officially released version.

For this album, the method of having the tracks [[segue]] into each other, which had been used for the two preceding RHCP albums ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' and ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', was dropped in favor of a conventional short pause at the end of each song. Both their subsequent albums ''[[By the Way]]'' and ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' have continued this trend.
