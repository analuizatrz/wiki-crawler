The capacity of Bootham Crescent had been 12,475 (3,245 seats), but this was reduced in 1994 because the family area of the Main stand was increased (due to popular demand as well as complying with the recommendations made in the Taylor Report) and 326 seats replaced a standing area resulting in reduced capacity and also stricter rules concerning the density of people standing (as a result of the recommendations made in the Taylor Report after the [[Hillsborough disaster]]) further reduced capacity.<ref name="The History of Bootham Crescent">{{cite web
