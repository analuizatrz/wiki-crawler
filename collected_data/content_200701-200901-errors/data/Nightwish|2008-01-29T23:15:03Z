'''Nightwish''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Symphonic metal|symphonic/power metal]] band, formed in [[1996 in music|1996]] in the town of [[Kitee]], in [[east]]ern [[Finland]]. Nightwish is considered one of the bands responsible for the development and rise in popularity of [[symphonic metal]] at the end of the 1990s,<ref>[http://www.amvlyrics.com/amv/nightwish/ AMV Lyrics]</ref> as well as the creation of the subgenre [[Power metal|symphonic power metal]].

Although the band has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first [[Single (music)|single]], "[[The Carpenter]]" (1997) and debut album ''[[Angels Fall First]]'', they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums ''[[Oceanborn]]'' and ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'', which were released in 1998 and 2000 respectively. Their 2004 album, ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'', led to Nightwish video clips being shown on [[MTV]] in the [[United States]] and inclusion of their music in U.S. movie soundtracks. Their biggest U.S. hit single, "[[Wish I Had an Angel]]" (2004), made it onto three U.S. film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web | title=IMDb | work=Nightwish | url=http://imdb.com/name/nm1743752/ | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as "[[Sleeping Sun]]", from the 2005 "[[Greatest hits|best of]]" compilation album, ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', prior to vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]]'s dismissal.

Former [[Alyson Avenue]] frontwoman [[Anette Olzon]] was recently revealed as Turunen's replacement,<ref name="blabber">{{cite web | title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET | work=NIGHTWISH Announces New Singer | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=73176 | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> and soon after the band released a new album, ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'',<ref name="dpprelease">{{cite web | title=Nightwish - The Official Website | work=The Band - Discography.

==History==
===''Nightwish demo'' (1996)===
Nightwish was conceived by [[musical keyboard|keyboardist]] [[Tuomas Holopainen]] after spending a night around a campfire with friends in July 1996. Holopainen recruited guitarist [[Emppu Vuorinen|Erno "Emppu" Vuorinen]] and vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]] to the project, who were attending the same school in Finland.

Based on the musical experimentations of Holopainen, the original band concept was to create acoustic music much like the music played around campfires. The band featured only keyboards, [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]]s, and the classical vocals of Turunen. The three musicians recorded their self-titled acoustic [[Demo (music)|demo]] in the winter of 1996. The name "Nightwish" was derived from the first song the band recorded together, and the first demo also included early versions of "The Forever Moments" and "Etiäinen". 

After recording the ''Nightwish Demo'', Holopainen decided that Turunen's operatic voice was too powerful for an acoustic band, and decided to add in [[heavy metal]] elements, including electric guitars and drums.<ref>[http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography Nightwish.com - Biography]</ref>

===''Angels Fall First'' (1997)===
In early 1997, following the release of the ''Nightwish Demo'', the band added drummer [[Jukka Nevalainen]], and replaced the acoustic guitar with [[electric guitars]]. The addition of  [[heavy metal]] elements to the bands existing experimental style gave the band a unique sound, forming the core of the Nightwish sound.

The band entered the studio in April 1997 to record seven songs for their second demo, entitled ''Angels Fall First''. As a precursor to their debut full length album of the same name, the demo made its way to the Finnish record label [[Spinefarm Records]] in May 1997. The label signed Nightwish to a two album deal, and the band returned to the studio to re-record songs from their second demo. The full length album ''[[Angels Fall First]]'' was released internationally in November 1997 and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts, with the single "[[The Carpenter]]" reaching number 3 on the Finnish singles chart. "The Carpenter" single was released as a split with label mates [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Thy Serpent]].

"Angels Fall First" was the only Nightwish album until 2007's ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'' to feature vocals by keyboardist [[Tuomas Holopainen]], appearing on six of the albums eleven tracks, alongside vocalist Tarja Turunen. 

Critical reception of ''Angels Fall First'' was mixed, with [[All Music Guide]] rating the album 2 out of 5 stars,<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | title=allmusic | work=Angels Fall First | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lza9qj1qojfa | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''The Metal Observer'' stating that Nightwish's debut album "paled drastically in comparison to their later work,"<ref name="metalobsv">{{cite web | title=The Metal Observer | work=Review – Nightwish – Angels Fall First | url=http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=1&id=2621 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> although it remains a fan favorite.

In December 1997, after over a year of existence, Nightwish made their live debut in their hometown [[Kitee]], [[Finland]]. During the winter of 1997 and 1998, the band performed only seven times, due to Nevalainen and Vuorinen's obligatory Finnish military service, and Turunen finishing school.

===''Oceanborn'' (1998–1999)===

Following a string of live shows in Finland, the band filmed their first video clip for "[[The Carpenter]]" in April 1998. Nightwish completed their touring line up in the summer of 1998 when [[Bass guitar|bassist]] [[Sami Vänskä]], an old friend of Holopainen's, joined the band. Nightwish then returned to the studio in August 1998 as a five-piece, to record their follow up album for Spinefarm records.

On December 7, 1998, Nightwish released their second full length album, ''[[Oceanborn]]'', in Finland only.   Adopting a more technical and progressive sound than ''Angels Fall First'',<ref name="jamesbyrd">{{cite web | title=James Byrd Tribute | work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://www.geocities.com/byrdtribute/nightwishocean.html | accessmonthday=December 27 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> ''Oceanborn'' saw the band abandon much of the ambient and folk elements present on their debut release. In contrast to the female vocals of Tururen, the album also featured guest growling vocals by [[Tapio Wilska]] (ex-[[Finntroll]]). 

''Oceanborn'' was well received, with ''All Music Guide'' writing that the album "as a whole works great", with songs that are "very strong".<ref name="AMG">{{cite web | title=All Music Guide Oceanborn review | work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:jrk9ikk0bbc9 | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref>  ''Oceanborn'' was an instant success in Finland, reaching number 5 on the Finnish album charts. The album's first single, "[[Sacrament of Wilderness]]", hit number 1 on the Finnish singles charts, where it stayed for several weeks.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> The album's release was initially limited to Finland, but due to the success of "Sacrement of Wilderness", Spinefarm released ''Oceanborn'' internationally in the spring of 1999.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> 

In May 1999, Nightwish recorded the single "[[Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse)]]". In one month the single sold 15,000 copies in Germany alone. Following the band's first international success, Nightwish was added as the opening band for [[Rage (band)|Rage]]'s 1999 European tour. Both the album ''Oceanborn'' and the single "Sacrament of Wilderness" were certified [[Gold album|gold]] in Finland in August 1999.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref>

===''Wishmaster'' (2000)===
While in the studio in early 2000 working on their third album, Nightwish was accepted in the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[2000 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Sleepwalker (Nightwish song)|Sleepwalker]]". ({{audio| Nightwish-sleepwalker.ogg|sample}}) Despite winning the public vote, Nightwish eventually finished in second place, with the jury choosing local gospel singer [[Nina Åström]] to represent Finland.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work= | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> 

In May 2000 Nightwish released their third studio album ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'' which debuted at #1 on the Finnish album charts, and following three weeks at number one, was certified gold in Finland.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work= | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref>  The album also saw high chart debuts in Germany at #21, and #66 in France.

Critical response to the album was mixed, with All Music Guide citing the album as repetitive, and saying "as a whole album, it can be a little annoying, even frustrating". However, German magazine ''[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]]'' declared ''Wishmaster'' "Album of the Month", despite competing against long-awaited May releases from [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Bon Jovi]].

Following the release of ''Wishmaster'', Nightwish embarked on their first world tour, playing dates in South America, Mexico, Canada, and the first headlining European tour with [[Sinergy]] and [[Eternal Tears Of Sorrow]].   In the summer the band returned to Europe, appearing at the  [[Wacken Open Air]] festival and the [[Biebop Metal Fest]].

===''Over the Hills and Far Away EP'' (2001)===
[[Image:Over Hills Far Away.jpg|thumb|left|200px|"[[Over the Hills and Far Away (album)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]", their first, and only, E.P.]]

In 2001 Nightwish recorded a cover of [[Gary Moore]]’s "Over the Hills and Far Away" together with two new songs ("10th Man Down" and "Away") and a remake of "[[Astral Romance]]" (from the [[Angels Fall First]] album). This was released as their first, and so far only, [[Extended play|EP]] "[[Over the Hills and Far Away (album)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]".

The record included guest performances by [[Tony Kakko]] (from the [[power metal]] band [[Sonata Arctica]]) and [[Tapio Wilska]] (ex-[[Finntroll]]). They also released a [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Compact disc|CD]] with live material recorded in a show in [[Tampere]], on [[December 29]], [[2000]]. All of these were entitled ''[[From Wishes to Eternity]]''.

Nightwish's version of "Over the Hills and Far Away" was well received by fans, being a repeating part of the band's live performances and featuring on several compilation albums as well as the "[[End of an Era]]" DVD (in 2006). However, the other new songs never had a great break-through nor has been re-released in any way, as of [[January]], [[2008]].

Shortly after the release, bassist [[Sami Vänskä]] was asked to leave the band, and [[Marco Hietala]] ([[Tarot (band)|Tarot]], [[Sinergy]]) joined the band, effectively leaving Sinergy. Hietala would, apart from playing his instrument, also perform male vocals. Earlier, when needed, either Holopainen (on the [[Angels Fall First]] album) or a guest musician performed the male vocals. Holopainen has afterwards said that he and Vänskä still keep in touch, killing off rumours saying that they haven't met since. Though, they are not interested in making another project together. The reason of Vänskä's dismissal was that he and Holopainen were too different as musicians, and this was seen as a threat to the band.

===''Century Child'' (2002 - 2003)===
[[Image:Nightwish Century Child.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Century Child]]'', their fourth album]]

In 2002 Nightwish released "[[Century Child]]", along with the singles "[[Ever Dream]]" and "[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]". The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live [[orchestra]] from Finland on "Bless the Child", "Ever Dream", "Feel For You" and "The Beauty of the Beast", to get a more present feeling of [[European classical music|classical music]]. An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band's version of "[[Phantom of the Opera]]", from the famous musical of the same name by composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. The song was repeatedly played on concerts till vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]] was replaced with [[Anette Olzon]], whereupon the band announced that they would never play the song again.

"Century Child" was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards. It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well; never before had the second been so distant from the first place. After the "[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]" video, a second one was recorded, without any single support. The chosen track was "[[End of All Hope]]". The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie, ''[[Kohtalon kirja]]'' (English: ''The Book of Fate'').<ref name="kohtalon">{{cite web | title=Kohtalon Kirja | work=Kohtalon Kirja DVD | url=http://www.kohtalonkirja.com/dvd | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

In 2003, Nightwish released their second DVD, entitled "[[End of Innocence]]". The DVD tells the story of the band in Holopainen and Nevalainen's words for two hours. The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc.

[[Singer|Vocalist]] [[Tarja Turunen]] also got [[marriage|married]] during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved. These rumours were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued on to play concerts for another year and released another album. The marriage later meant a great part in Tarja's dismissal from the band in the autumn of 2005.

===''Once'' (2004–2005)===
{{main|Once (Nightwish album)}}
[[Image:nightwishonce.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The cover of ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'' album]]

A new album entitled "[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]" was released on [[June 7]], [[2004]], along with their first single, "[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]" (Latin for "nobody"), from that album. The single topped the charts in Finland and [[Hungary]], and reached the top ten in five additional countries. "Nemo" therefore remains their most successful single release to date.

With ''Once'', Nightwish started to produce so called [[orchestra|orchestral versions]] of the most famous songs - versions where the music is more calmed down, excepting almost all drums and guitars (even though for example the orchestral version of "[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]" includes an electric guitar solo). Famous songs that so far has been produced as orchestral versions are for example "[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]", "[[Ghost Love Score]]", "[[Eva (song)|Eva]]" and "[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]".

''Once'' utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album. Unlike ''Century Child'', Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the [[London Session Orchestra]]. It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, "[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan|Kuolema tekee taiteilijan]]" (English: "Death Makes an Artist"). ''Once'' has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in [[Germany]], gold in [[Sweden]] and reached #1 in the [[Greece|Greek]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] and Hungarian album charts. The following singles were: "[[Wish I Had an Angel]]" (featured on the soundtrack of the ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'' film), "[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan]]" (released only in Finland and [[Japan]]) and "[[The Siren (song)|The Siren]]". Besides the commercial success, ''Once'' was also accepted by critics, with many positive reviewers drawing comparisons with ''Oceanborn''.
The success of the album allowed them to perform the ''Once World Tour'', which enabled them to play in many countries the band had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], held in [[Helsinki]], highlighting acclaim the band has recently gained.

A "best of" album was released in September 2005, containing songs from their whole discography. 
The compilation is entitled ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', also featuring a live cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s song "[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]" (from the ''[[The Division Bell]]'' album). This song was the first in which Hietala performs the vocals by himself ([[Media:Nightwish-highhopes.ogg|sample]]). Besides ''High Hopes'', a remake of "[[Sleeping Sun]]" (from ''Oceanborn'') was put on the album, which was also released as a single. A new video for "Sleeping Sun" was shot, featuring a [[medieval]] battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.

===End of an Era (2005–2006)===
[[Image:Endofanera.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The cover of ''[[End of an Era]]'' DVD]]

After the recording in the [[Hartwall Areena]] (Helsinki) on 21 October, 2005, of the new live DVD ''[[End of an Era]]'' (released June 2006), the four other members of Nightwish decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Tarja Turunen,<ref name="wikisource">{{cite web | publisher=Wikisource | title=Open letter to Tarja Turunen | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Open_Letter_To_Tarja_Turunen | accessmonthday=October 23 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> a feeling they expressed through an [[open letter]] which was given to Turunen by Tuomas Holopainen after the concert, and afterwards posted on the band's website. It was written by Holopainen but signed by the other band members. The main justification of Turunen's dismissal given in the letter was that the band felt that both her husband Marcelo Cabuli (an Argentine businessman) and [[Commercialism|commercial]] interests had changed her attitude towards the band. 

Turunen responded to the incident twice, at one press conference in Finland and at one in Germany, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her. She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out to the public was "senselessly cruel". She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website,<ref name="tarjaturunena">{{cite web | publisher=METALYOU.COM | title=Tarja Turunen Letter to the band, fans and media | url=http://www.metalyou.com/band/nightwish/news/nightwish_tarja_turunen_letter_to_the_band_fans_and_media/ | accessmonthday=August 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews.

===''Dark Passion Play'' (2006 – 2007)===
{{main|Dark Passion Play}}

[[Image:Dark Passion Play.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', Nightwish’s sixth studio album, the first with [[Anette Olzon]]]]

In [[2006]] - [[2007]], the band recorded their sixth full-length studio album, ''[[Dark Passion Play]]''. The process began with drum recordings, then guitar, bass and demo keyboards. Orchestral and choir recordings took place in [[Abbey Road Studios]]. After those, the final synthesizers and vocals were recorded.<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

To find a replacement for [[Tarja Turunen|Turunen]] as the female vocalist of the band, on [[March 17]], [[2006]] the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot. During this time, speculation began to emerge as to who would eventually succeed Turunen as the female vocalist for the band. In April 2007, the heavy metal magazine [[Terrorizer]] reported that [[Sarah Brightman]] would be the new vocalist, which proved false. In response to these and other rumors, the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist.<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

For the same reason, the identity of the new singer was to be published earlier, and on Thursday 24 May, the 35-year-old [[Anette Olzon]] from [[Katrineholm]], [[Sweden]] was announced to replace Turunen.<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Holopainen has said in interviews he did not wish to reveal her identity until new material was available because he did not want fans judging her by nothing more than a picture, or past work.

{{Wikinews|Nightwish release 'Dark Passion Play', most expensive album in Finnish history‎}}

The day after this revealing, charity single "[[Eva (song)|Eva]]" was released as the first off the album, as download only. It was originally scheduled for release on [[May 30]], but due to a leak on a British music download site the single was released on [[May 25]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> This was the first published song (excluding short audio samples on the website) to feature Olzon.

On 13 June Nightwish released the title, ''Dark Passion Play'', and artwork to the new album on their official website, as well as the name and the cover of the second single (this time CD), "[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]". The single, that first was released in Finland on [[August 22]], included a bonus track entitled "[[While Your Lips Are Still Red]]" written by Tuomas as the main theme track for the upcoming Finnish feature film "Lieksa!". Technically, it is not a Nightwish-track as it only features [[Marco Hietala]] on vocals and acoustic bass, [[Tuomas Holopainen]] on keys and [[Jukka Nevalainen]] on drums. The song’s video was officially released on [[June 15]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> "Amaranth" achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores.<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

''Dark Passion Play'' was released around Europe in the last week of September, 2007, in the UK on October 1st, and the United States on October 2nd. There were three separate releases: 1) a single-disc standard version and 2) a 2-CD Special Edition which will contain 1 bonus track on the 1st disc and a 2nd CD comprised of orchestral versions of every song on the album and 3) a limited edition 3CD version with the two CDs from version two and a third one with some demo versions (of for example "[[The Poet and the Pendulum]]") as well as some bonus tracks (for example "[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]" CD-single's b-side "[[The Escapist]]" and the third single "[[Erämaan Viimeinen]]", a vocal version of "[[Last of the Wilds]]"<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

In this album, perhaps because of former female vocalist [[Tarja Turunen|Tarja's]] dismissal, male vocalist [[Marco Hietala]] achieves more freedom in his vocals, singing at least back up in every single song of the album with the exception of "[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]", and singing exclusively in several songs, such as "[[The Islander]]", "Master Passion Greed", "[[While Your Lips Are Still Red]]" and "[[Reach (Nightwish song)|Reach]]" (both latter bonus tracks), and singing chorus in songs such as "[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]" and "[[7 Days to the Wolves]]".<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Several magazines, including Kerrang! have noted how the departure of Tarja Turunen seems to have released the band from their shell and how restraint has been left to other bands. The use of some 175 additional musicians for the orchestral and solo parts of the album has resulted in the band now being described as "Epic Metal" by many people - especially in 14 minute album opener "The Poet and The Pendulum". The album was awarded 5/5 (classic) by Kerrang! magazine.<ref>Kerrang!</ref>

The third single of the album was first reported to be "[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]", and a music video to this song was recorded together with "[[Amaranth]]"'s, and released in [[September]], 2007. However, changed minds resulted in the third single being "[[Erämaan Viimeinen]]", a previously unreleased vocal version of the instrumental song "[[Last of the Wilds]]". It was released in Finland only on [[December 5]], [[2007]]. On this song, Jonsu of the Finnish [[pop music|pop]]/[[rock music|rock]] band [[Indica (Finnish band)|Indica]] performs the Finnish vocals.<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

On [[December 13]], [[2007]], Nightwish opened an official account on [[YouTube]], linked to from their official website. On this, they've uploaded live filmings from their concerts.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/nightwishofficial YouTube]</ref>

On [[January 8]], [[2008]], "[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]" was officially revealed to be the fourth single by the band's official website.<ref>[http://nightwish.com/en/news/archive?month=01&year=2008 Nightwish.com - January 2008 News]</ref> It will be released on [[February 15]], [[2008]], in two versions; DVD and CD.<ref>[http://www.nwshop.fi/productinfo.cfm?tuotenumero=196964&from=startpage&lang=en Nightwish-Shop]</ref>

According to Holopainen, this will be the longest tour the band has yet attempted, and will probably last about two and a half years.<ref>[http://www.tuomasholopainen.net/int-thnet2.html "TuomasHolopainen.net: Interview"]</ref> As of January, 2008, tour dates are booked until May, 2008. Nightwish has confirmed that they will do a third US tour in 2008's second semester.

==Music==
===Influence===
{{main|Tuomas Holopainen}}
Tuomas Holopainen, writer of most of the band's lyrics and [[Sheet music|musical score]]s, says that he gets most of the inspiration for Nightwish's songs from [[Film score|film music]]. Songs like "Beauty of the Beast" (from ''[[Century Child]]'') and "[[Ghost Love Score]]" (from ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'') are examples of this influence. Other songs, such as "Romanticide" and "[[Wish I Had an Angel]]" (both from ''Once'') have elements reminiscent of [[industrial music]]. Holopainen has also said that film music is the music he listens to for leisure. He likes, for example, the musical scores to ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'' and ''[[Crimson Tide]]'', and practically everything written by [[Hans Zimmer]].

Fantasy novels are also a big influence on Nightwish's music. Many of the lyrics make fairly clear references to fantasy novels, especially the ''Dragonlance'' series. Songs such as "Wishmaster"  and Wanderlust seem to be heavily influenced by the novels. References to The Kharolis Mountains, 'Shalafi' and Krynn can be found in these songs. The music of "7 Days to the Wolves" is inspired by [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower]]'' series.

On the other hand, Nightwish has also been noted as a source of inspiration for other bands. [[Simone Simons]], lead singer of [[Epica (band)|Epica]], stated that she began singing due to Nightwish.<ref name="epica">{{cite web | title=Epica Online | work=Profile Simone | url=http://www.epica.nl/index.php?id=45&section=band | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Ex-singer of [[Visions of Atlantis]] [[Nicole Bogner]] also acknowledged that Nightwish had greatly inspired them for their first album.<ref name="musdiscvisions">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=Visions of Atlantis (Nicole Bogner) | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/voa.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[Sander Gommans]] of [[After Forever]] said that Nightwish "will certainly influence us in creating new songs".<ref name="musdiscafter">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=After Forever | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/aftfor.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[Power metal]] band [[Sonata Arctica]]'s lead singer [[Tony Kakko]] has explained how much of an influence Nightwish is to him.<ref name="gauntlet">{{cite web | title=The Gauntlet | work=Sonata Arctica Interview | url=http://euro.thegauntlet.com/interviews/1159/Sonata%20Arctica.html | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Musical style===
A precise definition for Nightwish's musical style is disputed. The band has been suggested as being part of the genres [[gothic metal]], [[symphonic metal]], and [[power metal]]. Tuomas Holopainen once described their music as "melodic heavy metal with a female vocalist".<ref name="nightfall">{{cite web | title=Nightfall | work=Nightfall interview with: Tuomas Holopainen from Nightwish | url=http://www.nightfall.co.nz/interview_detail.php?interviewID=52 | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

In the beginning of Nightwish's career, in 1996, Holopainen's idea of the band was to create a new but still old genre; the kind of acoustic music played by the open fire on hiking events, to confront radio and CD scene. As he in 1997 realized that Turunen's voice would be much too strong for such a project, though, he abandoned it to instead focus on [[heavy metal music|metal]]. Since, Nightwish's music has been very experimental, focusing on mixing genres and using material that is old, but new to the scene.

The definition [[symphonic metal]] is based on Nightwish's inclusion of instruments and vocal styles of [[classical music]] and [[film scores]], as well as the massive use of [[musical keyboards|keyboard]] effects ([[Tuomas Holopainen|Holopainen]]). Bassist / vocalist [[Marco Hietala]] has also called their music "film score metal" similar to the music of [[Rhapsody of Fire]]. The uplifting [[fantasy]] themes, epic atmospheres, high vocals, guitar and keyboard solos and fast melodic musical style of Nightwish's music, especially the first three albums, place them in the [[power metal]] genre similar to other Finnish bands such as [[Sonata Arctica]] and [[Stratovarius]]. The [[gothic metal]] tag is usually used by magazines such as [[Kerrang]] as many Nightwish songs have gothic elements, such as the lyrics, the simple guitar riffs and piano, and [[Beauty and the Beast]] lyrics. However, the gothic metal elements are not used frequently enough to mark the entire band's genre, but only a few songs / albums; for example "[[Phantom of the Opera]] and "Beauty and the Beast".

A new era for Nightwish's musical style began with "[[Century Child]]" and was developed further with the next albums, "[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]" and "[[Dark Passion Play]]". The guitars were downtuned and simplified to a lower rhythmical sound closer to modern [[hard rock]] than the old melodic [[power metal]] style leads and [[Tarja Turunen]]'s vocals lost some of their operatic edge, becoming closer to standard [[rock music|rock]] female singing. As Turunen was replaced with [[Anette Olzon]] in 2007, practically everything of the operatic vocals were lost, for the Dark Passion Play album. Male vocals from new bassist [[Marco Hietala]] added a new, rougher dimension to songs like "[[Planet Hell]]" and "[[Wish I Had An Angel]]".
