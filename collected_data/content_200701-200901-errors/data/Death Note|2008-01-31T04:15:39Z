{{Nihongo|'''''Death Note'''''|デスノート|Desu Nōto}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series created by writer [[Tsugumi Ohba]] and illustrator [[Takeshi Obata]]. The series primarily centers around a high school student who decides to rid the world of evil with the help of a [[supernatural]] [[notebook]] that kills anyone whose name is written in it.

''Death Note'' was first serialized by [[Shueisha]] in the Japanese manga magazine ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'' from the first issue in December 2003 to May 2006, with 108 chapters in total. The series has been published in its entirety in 12 [[tankōbon]] volumes in Japan and in [[North America]]. The series has been adapted into a pair of [[Live action|live-action]] [[film]]s released in Japan on [[June 17]] [[2006]] and [[November 3]] [[2006]], and an [[anime]] series which aired in Japan from [[October 3]] [[2006]] to [[June 26]] [[2007]]. Also, a [[novelization]] of the series, written by [[light novel]]ist [[Nisio Isin]], was released in Japan on [[August 1]] [[2006]].

== Plot ==
[[Light Yagami]] is an extremely intelligent young man who resents the crime and corruption in the world. His life undergoes a drastic change in the year 2003, when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the "Death Note", lying on the ground. The Death Note's instructions claim that if a human's name is written within it, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the notebook's authenticity,  but after experimenting with it, Light realizes that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a ''[[shinigami]]'' named [[Shinigami (Death Note)#Ryuk|Ryuk]], Light seeks to become "the God of the new world" by passing his judgment on those he deems to be evil or who get in his way.

Soon, the number of inexplicable deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the [[Interpol|International Police Organization]] and a mysterious detective known only as "''[[L (Death Note)|L]]''". L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as "''Kira''" (derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word "''Killer''"), is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a game of psychological [[Wiktionary:cat and mouse game|cat and mouse]] between the two begins.

== Characters ==
<!-- Not too much spoilers, please! This article must only show a GLIMPSE of the story, not deliver it all in a plate, for more information, other pages were created. -->

{{Main|List of Death Note characters}}

=== Main characters ===
;<span id="Light"/>{{Nihongo|Light Yagami (Kira)|夜神 月|Yagami Raito}}
:The protagonist of ''Death Note'', Light is an extremely intelligent but bored 17-year old student. When he finds the Death Note, dropped in the human world by Ryuk (a shinigami), he decides to use it to kill all criminals and earns the title ''Kira''. His ultimate goal is to cleanse the world of evil to create a [[utopia]] and then reign over this new world as its [[god]].

;<span id="L"/>{{Nihongo|L Lawliet|エル・ローライト|Eru Rōraito}}
:L is the world's top-rated detective, tasked with tracking down and arresting Kira. As such, he is Light's arch-enemy. His disheveled appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. L has many quirks, such as sitting in an odd manner, snacking on sweets constantly, and holding objects in a peculiar manner. He often takes drastic strategies to confuse and force the hand of his opponents. On several occasions he has willingly disclosed several of his weaknesses to Kira at the risk of his own life in the hopes that he would lure him into a trap.

;<span id="Misa"/>{{Nihongo|Misa Amane|弥 海砂|Amane Misa}}
:A girl with an immense crush on Kira, Misa is a popular [[Japanese idol|idol]] in [[Japan]]. She is immature and tends to refer to herself in the third person in an attempt to be cute. Misa is completely devoted to Light, and she once said that she loved him at first sight. Light, however, only views her as an asset to his plans because of her Death Note and her ''Shinigami'' eyes (that she obtained at the cost of half of her remaining life span, twice). Misa devotes herself to Light because he killed her parents' murderer after several trials had failed to convict him.

;<span id="Mello"/>{{Nihongo|Mello|メロ|Mero}}
:Mello was an orphan who grew up with Near in Watari's shelter for gifted children. Like Near, Mello was one of the candidates to become L's successor. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, he is often seen eating bars of chocolate. Although Mello is quite intelligent, he often lets his emotions get the better of him. Mello wears leather most of the time, unlike Near or L. He also appears to be less secluded in terms of his friends and hobbies, and seems to be fond of biking.

;<span id="Near"/>{{Nihongo|Near|ニア|Nia}}
:Near was a primary candidate to become L's successor and calls himself N during the course of his investigations. He shares a number of similarities with L. Much like how L plays with things such as sugar cubes and forks, Near is frequently shown playing with toys or his hair. Near also sits in an unusual manner similar to L, but with some slight differences. He offered to join forces with Mello to fight Kira, but Mello turned him down. Near then gained the support of the US government and formed the Secret Provision for Kira (SPK).

;<span id="Teru"/>{{Nihongo|Teru Mikami|魅上 照|Mikami Teru}}
:Mikami is selected as the fourth Kira by Light, after Light decides that it is too dangerous for the Death Note to be near Misa or himself, since he and Misa are currently under surveillance by Aizawa and Mogi. A prosecuting attorney and adamant supporter of Kira, Mikami shares many of the same ideals, thoughts, and priorities as Kira, and is ecstatic when he discovers that Kira, his God, has chosen him, proving that God is on his side and watching. He is completely devoted and loyal to Kira, believing that divine justice must be brought down upon the people. Little is known about his personal life; he appears to have no hobbies or anything else of the sort. He chants<!-- 

Do NOT change his chant to "elimination", delete is what's used in the English manga. Thank you.

--> "delete" with each name he writes down in the Death Note due to events in his past when he thought God was "deleting" the evil people in his life. He, like Misa, has made the exchange of half his remaining years for ''Shinigami'' eyes.

=== ''Shinigami'' (Death Gods) ===
{{main|Shinigami (Death Note)}}
;<span id="Ryuk"/>{{Nihongo|Ryuk|リューク|Ryūku}}
:A ''[[shinigami]]'' who dropped a Death Note into the human world, which Light would pick up. Acting out of pure boredom, Ryuk begins the story of Death Note on a whim. It is stated that Ryuk obtained the second Death Note in the ''shinigami'' world from "tricking the old man" for another one. Ryuk is not Light's ally, and in fact declares in their first meeting that someday he (Ryuk) would write Light's name into his own Death Note. Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goals. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. However, Ryuk will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples, without which he suffers a form of [[Withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms]].

;<span id="Rem"/>{{Nihongo|Rem|レム|Remu}}
<!-- Rem is female. She is the only female Death God we know of, but she is indeed female, so please do not change this section again to imply that she is male. It will be considered vandalism. Thank you. -->
:The female ''[[shinigami]]'' who first gives Misa her Death Note and trades her for the ''Shinigami'' eyes. Similar to Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, she purposely gives one of them to Misa Amane. Rem inherited her second Death Note from Jealous, another ''shinigami'' who died when he saved Misa's life, and thought it only right to pass it on to Misa. Rem inherits Jealous' love for Misa as well and is prompt to defend Misa even at the cost of her life. Rem shows this when she states that she will kill Light if Misa dies before her time.

;<span id="Shidou"/>{{Nihongo|Shidoh|シドウ|Shidō}}
:The third [[Shinigami]] seen in the human world, Shidoh is revealed as the original owner of the Death Note Ryuk dropped at the beginning of the series.  Initially upon entering the human world, Shidoh relentlessly follows Ryuk, demanding the return of their Death Note.  Ryuk eventually admits he has no knowledge of the location of Shidoh's Death Note, said note having been used as a bargaining chip by Light and fallen into Mello's hands.  Shidoh eventually locates his Death Note, and under questioning, reveals to Mello (who subsequently reveals to Near) that some of the rules written in the Death Note are fake.

== Death Note ==
A ''[[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]]''{{'}}s "Death Note" is a notebook with the power to kill the human whose name is written on it. All Death Notes follow a specific set of rules.

=== Written rules ===
Before releasing his Death Note in the human world, Ryuk wrote the basic rules on the Note's first page. The rules were written in English because he was convinced this was the most popular human language. The basic rules are as follows:
<!-- NOTE: All of the rules that belong in this section are here. Please do not add any other rules to this section, or remove any of them. Thank you.!-->
*The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
*This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
*If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the subject's name, it will happen.
*If the cause of death is not specified, the subject will simply die of a [[cardiac arrest|heart attack]]. 
*After writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds (400 seconds).

In addition to these basic rules, each volume of the [[manga]] has a page containing new rules or possible uses for the ''Death Note''. In the anime series, each [[eyecatch]] (usually two per episode) contains a different rule written in both English and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], similar to how they were revealed in the Japanese manga. These rules often serve to clarify the more esoteric uses of the Death Note that the characters discover on their own.

== Media ==
''Death Note'' began as a [[manga]] series which was later adapted to become a set of [[Live action|live-action]] [[film]]s, an [[anime]] based on the manga, and a light novel. Two games have also been released at present for the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan, the first being a 'Mafia' inspired social game and the second being a [[board game]] with traps. The third game is to be released on February 7, 2008.

The ''Death Note'' [[anime]], directed by [[Tetsurō Araki]] and animated by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]], began airing in Japan on [[October 3]] [[2006]],<ref name="sbook">{{cite web|url=http://www.s-book.net/shueisha/tvguide/|title=Shueisha TV Guide|publisher=[http://www.s-book.net/ S-book.net]|accessdate=2006-11-09|language=Japanese}}</ref> and finished its run on [[June 26]] [[2007]], totaling 37 twenty-minute episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/english/pc/ntv-animation.pdf|title=Nippon Television Network Program Catalogue: Animation|accessdate=2006-11-06|format=PDF|pages=4|publisher=[[Nippon Television]]}}</ref> Contrary to the movies, the anime series closely follows the original storyline of the first seven volumes of the [[manga]] (L's arc) then rushes significantly through N's arc by accentuating many action scenes and skipping monologues or long discussions between characters described in the final 5 volumes of the manga series. There are also a few changes on the character designs, adapted by [[Masaru Kitao]], and the order of facts, as well as a few additional scenes not featured in the original manga. It is also set in the year [[2007]], instead of starting at the year [[2003]]. The series aired on the [[Nippon Television]] network "every Tuesday at 24:56".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/deathnote/index.html|title=Official Death Note Anime Website|accessdate=2006-11-06|publisher=[[Nippon Television]]|language=Japanese}}</ref> The series was co-produced by Madhouse, Nippon Television, [[Shueisha]], [[:ja:D.N.ドリームパートナーズ|D.N.

In [[North America]], the series has been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for residents in the [[United States of America]] to use "Download-to-Own" and "Download-to-Rent" services while it was still airing in Japan.

People, STOP CHANGING THE FIGURES TO WHOEVER IS ON THE COVER. The first edition DVDs of Death Note come with a small figure of a character from Death Note. The character they come with is DIFFERENT FROM WHOEVER IS ON THE COVER. I own every DVD released up to this point, so I'm quite sure on this...

In response to the above hidden text; I have modified the list a little as according to a website which lists all proper figurines. Matsuda is not in volume 12, it's Takada. And volume 13 having the King of Shinigami is likely to be true as there is a mysteriously shaped figurine shown here; http://www.vap.co.jp/deathnote/a/dvd13.html

A ''Death Note'' [[video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], entitled {{Nihongo|'''''Death Note Kira's Game'''''|デスノート キラゲーム|Desu Nōto Kira Gēmu}}, was released on [[February 15]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Death Note Ads Starting To Make Their Way Into Magazine Pages|url=http://ds.qj.net/category/Death-Note/cid/2230|work=[http://www.qj.net/ QJ.net]|date=[[2006]]-[[08-19]]|accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref> 
''Kira Game'' is a strategy game where the player takes on the role of Kira or L. These are just titles, as any character can be Kira or L. The player will attempt to deduce who their enemy is (Kira will try to uncover L's identity and vice versa). This will play out in 3 phases: Investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; Voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player's performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part) or force a member off of the team (Kira part).<ref name="game">{{cite web|title=Official Konami Website for Death Note|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/deathnote/|publisher=Konami|accessdate=2007-02-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> The gameplay is very similar to that of the common party game [[Mafia (game)|Mafia]].

A sequel to the game, {{Nihongo|'''''Death Note L o Tsugumono'''''|デスノート Lを継ぐ者|Desu Nōto Eru o Tsugumono|literally "''Death Note: Successor to L''"}}, was released in Japan on [[July 12]] [[2007]].

There have been several soundtracks released for this series, such as the ones for the movie adaptations and also for the [[anime]] adaptation.

== Controversy ==
=== People's Republic of China ===
Some schools in [[Shenyang]], [[People's Republic of China]] have banned the [[manga]] after some of their students started to tease friends and teachers by altering a [[notebook]] to resemble a Death Note and writing their names in them.<ref name="shenyang">{{cite news|title=Death Note Stirs Controversy in China|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=6111|accessdate=2006-11-07|date=[[2006]]-[[02-06]]|work=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>

The newspaper ''Shenyang Night Report'' called ''Death Note'' "poison, creating wicked hearts".<ref name="shenyang"/> One major Chinese newspaper felt that the ban is an overreaction and is inappropriate.<ref name="shenyang"/>

[[Beijing]] also has a ban on "horror stories" around schools to protect the "physical and mental health" of students, which includes local adaptations of ''Death Note''.<ref name="Beijing">{{cite news|title=Beijing bans scary stories to protect young|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSPEK30969020070515|accessdate=2007-05-15|date=[[2007]]-[[05-15]]|work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> China itself is likewise trying to weed out pirated copies of the books and television series, as well other [[J-Horror|Japanese horror]] magazines, where no legal publication house prints it. Wang Song of the National [[Anti-piracy]] and Anti-pornography [[Congress Working Committee|Working Committee]] has said that the series "misleads innocent children and distorts their mind and spirit".<ref name="China Daily">{{cite news|title='Death Note' days numbered|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-05/26/content_880773.htm|accessdate=2007-05-27|date=[[2007]]-[[05-26]]|work=[[China Daily]]}}</ref>

Belgian police are investigating the matter further.<ref>{{cite news|title=Notes left near bodies in Belgium linked to Death Note|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-01/notes-left-near-bodies-in-belgium-linked-to-death-note|work=[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ Anime News Network]|date=[[2007]]-[[09-28]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Japanese message found near body remains in Vorst (Belgium)|url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/nieuws/belgie/603795?wt.bron=homeArt4|work=[[De Morgen]]|date=[[2007-10-04]]}} {{nl icon}}</ref>
