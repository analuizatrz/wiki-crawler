'''Iron Man''' ('''Anthony Edward Stark''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]], [[Don Heck]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 (March 1963).

Iron Man starred in generally 13-page but occasionally 18-page adventures, with the rest of ''Tales of Suspense'' devoted to [[anthology]] [[science fiction]] and [[supernatural]] stories. After debuting with bulky grey armor, Iron Man was redesigned with similar but golden armor in his second story (issue #40, April 1963), with the first iteration of his familiar, sleek red-and-golden armor appearing in issue #48 (Dec. 1963), drawn by [[Steve Ditko]] (though whether he or Kirby, singly or in collaboration, designed it, is uncertain).

Beginning with issue #59 (Nov. 1964), Iron Man began sharing the now "split book" ''Tales of Suspense'' with [[Captain America]]. After the final issue, #99 (March 1968), the book became ''Captain America''; Iron Man appeared in the one-shot ''[[Iron Man and Sub-Mariner]]'' #1 (April 1968), and then debuted in his own title with ''Iron Man'' #1 (May 1968).

Iron Man possesses technologically advanced [[armor]] that gives him exponentially amplified strength,a virtually unlimited tech arsenal, and the ability to survive environmetal extremes, such as the deep sea or outer space. The armor was invented and, with occasional short-term exceptions, worn by Tony Stark, an [[United States of America|American]] [[industrialist]] billionaire and [[United States military|military]] contractor known not only for his lifestyle, but also for his incredible ingenuity and inventive genius. Other people who have assumed the Iron Man identity include close associates [[Happy Hogan|Harold "Happy" Hogan]], Eddie March, [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] and (briefly) [[Guardsman (comics)|Michael O'Brien]].

Iron Man was originally an [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] hero. Throughout the character’s [[comic book]] series, technological advancement and [[National security|national defense]] were constant themes, but later issues developed Stark into a more complex and vulnerable character as they depicted his battle with [[alcoholism]] and other personal difficulties. 

Writers often portray Iron Man as a symbol of humanity's creativity as well as its frailties,and he draws a lot of comparison to [[Howard Hughes]]. He is often placed in contrast with his close friends [[Captain America]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the former as a comparison between interventionist and cooperative attitudes, and the latter comparing science and the supernatural. Throughout most of his career, Iron Man has been a member of the superhero team [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]], and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic-book series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:ToS39.jpg|160px|left|thumb|''Tales of Suspense'' #39 (March 1963): Iron Man debuts. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Don Heck]].<!--credits per Jack Kirby Museum site-->]]
Anthony Stark was born in [[Long Island, New York]]. He enters the undergraduate [[engineering]] program at [[MIT]] while only 15 years old and graduates at the top of his class. At the age of 21, he inherits his father's company, Stark Industries, after his parents are killed in a car accident. One of the first things Stark does is to buy out the company that made the faulty brakes on his parent's car and correct the mechanical problem.

While on a visit to [[Vietnam]] (later updated to the Gulf War) to see how his new mini-[[transistor]]s could assist the [[United States of America|American]] war effort, Stark is caught in a booby trap. Captured by a Vietnamese warlord named Wong Chu, and dying from a piece of [[shrapnel]] lodged in his heart from the booby trap, Stark is pressed into building weapons for Wong Chu, along with a fellow prisoner, the famed physicist Yin Sen (later called Ho Yinsen). However, Stark and Yin Sen use the workshop to secretly design and construct a suit of [[powered armor]] — an iron [[exoskeleton]] that gives Stark tremendous strength as well as other abilities — that will not only keep Stark's heart beating, but also allow him to escape. Yin Sen sacrifices himself to buy Stark time to charge the bulky suit of armor, and as Iron Man, Stark makes short work of Wong Chu and his men. On the way back, Iron Man encounters a wounded [[United States|American]] [[Air force|Air Force]] helicopter pilot, [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]]. Introducing himself as Stark's bodyguard, Iron Man and Rhodes manage to defend themselves against the pursuing [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese]] before making it back to American lines. On his return to the US, Stark continues to improve the armor, establishing a dual identity as the adventurer and superhero Iron Man. He also greatly expands his father's company, Stark Industries, eventually renaming it Stark International.

The cover for Iron Man is that he is Stark's [[bodyguard]] and corporate mascot. To that end, Iron Man fights threats to his company, [[Communist]] opponents such as the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], the [[Crimson Dynamo]] and the Titanium Man as well as independent villains like the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. Both the Widow and the Dynamo eventually defect to the United States, and even erstwhile villain [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], originally a pawn of the Widow, reforms and join the Avengers. No one suspects Stark of being Iron Man as he cultivates an image as a rich playboy and industrialist. Two notable members of Stark's supporting cast at this point are his personal chauffeur Harold "Happy" Hogan and secretary Virginia "Pepper" Potts, to both of whom he eventually reveals his dual identity.

The comic took an anti-Communist stance in its early years, which was softened as opposition rose to the [[Vietnam War]]. This change evolved in a series of stories with Stark profoundly reconsidering his political opinions and the morality of manufacturing weapons for the military. Stark, however, has remained essentially [[Conservativism|conservative]] both in character and politics, despite his playboy image. He also often shows himself to be occasionally arrogant and willing to justify the means with the ends. This leads to personal conflicts with the people around him, both in his civilian and superhero identities. 

Stark has a vast personal fortune, and is also known as a philanthropist. He donates the use of his boyhood manor as [[Avengers Mansion]], and funds the Avengers' operations through the Maria Stark Foundation, a [[non-profit organization]] named after his late mother. The Foundation is not linked to any of Stark's businesses, and has continued to operate even when those businesses have failed. Stark also provides technology to other superheroes, including designing various replacement shields for Captain America, the quinjets used by the Avengers, the image inducers used by the [[X-Men]] and Spider-Man's second [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor|armored costume]].

Eventually, Stark's [[heart condition]] is discovered by the public and cured with an artificial [[Organ transplant|heart transplant]]. However, Stark is also developing a serious dependency on [[alcoholism|alcohol]]. The first time it becomes a problem is when Stark discovers that the national security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] has been buying a controlling interest in his company in order to ensure Stark's continued weapons development for them. At the same time, Stark's business rival [[Justin Hammer]] hires several supervillains to attack Stark. At one point, the Iron Man armor is even taken over and used to murder a diplomat. Although Iron Man is not immediately under suspicion, Stark is forced to hand the armor over to the authorities. Eventually Stark and Rhodes, now his personal pilot and confidant, track down and defeat those responsible, although Hammer would return to bedevil Stark again. With the support of his then-girlfriend, [[Bethany Cabe]], his friends and employees, Stark pulls through these crises and, for the moment, overcomes his dependency on alcohol.

===Changing fortunes===
[[Image:ironman1.jpg|160px|right|thumb|''Iron Man'' Vol. 1, #1 (May 1968). Cover art by [[Gene Colan]] & [[Frank Giacoia]].]]
Some time later, a ruthless rival, [[Obadiah Stane]], manipulates him emotionally into a serious relapse. As a result, Stark loses control of Stark International, becomes a homeless vagrant and gives up his armored identity to Rhodes, who becomes the new Iron Man for a lengthy period of time. Eventually, Stark recovers and starts a new company, Circuits Maximus.  While Stark concentrates on new technological designs, Rhodes continues to act as Iron Man but steadily grows more aggressive and paranoid. Rhodes's problems are initially thought to be the result of his using armors whose cerebral interfaces are calibrated for Stark's brain, but are later revealed to be purely psychological in nature. Rhodes goes on a rampage, and Stark has to don a prototype suit to stop him. When Circuits Maximus comes under assault from Stane, Stark uses the completed next-generation armor to confront Stane in personal combat. Stark's skill proves superior over Stane's unskilled use of his own variant suit (known as the [[Iron Monger]]) and Stark regains his company when Stane commits suicide rather than be captured.

===Armor Wars===
In an attempt to stop other people from misusing his designs, Stark goes about disabling other armored heroes and villains who are using suits based on the Iron Man technology, the designs of which were stolen by his enemy [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]]. However, these "Armor Wars" have tragic consequences, when he inadvertently causes the death of the Soviet [[Titanium Man]]. He also severely hurts his reputation as Iron Man by disabling the armor of the SHIELD operatives known as the [[Mandroid]]s, disabling the armor of the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] (the Guardsmen were the guards of the supervillain detention center known as the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], and Iron Man's actions led to a small prison breakout), and defeating the government operative known as [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]] in battle.  The situation was worsened when Stark realized that Stingray's armor did not incorporate any of his designs.

[[Image:Im283.jpg|160px|thumb|left|''Iron Man'' Vol. 1, #283 (Aug. 1992). Cover art by [[Kevin Hopgood]].]]
This also leads to a falling out between Stark and Steve Rogers (who at the time has given up his Captain America identity). Rogers, while agreeing with Stark's motives, disapproves of his high-handed methods, considering them reckless and dangerous. [[Federal government of the United States|The United States government]] declares Iron Man a danger when he goes after their Stark-derived [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] suits and Iron Man is hunted down. Stark eventually fakes Iron Man's demise and claims that a new person is in the armor. Stark also patches up his friendship with Steve Rogers.

However, Stark's health continues to deteriorate, and it is discovered that the armor's [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] interface is causing irreversible damage to his [[nervous system]]. His condition is aggravated by a failed attempt on his life by a mentally unbalanced former lover which injures his spine, paralyzing him. Stark has a nerve chip implanted into his spine to regain his mobility, but this makes his body vulnerable to outside control, even though his mind is unaffected. With Rhodes's help, and using the cybernetically controlled Iron Man armor to move his remotely controlled body, he eventually defeats the villain responsible.

However, Stark's nervous system continues its slide towards failure, and he constructs a "skin" made up of artificial nerve circuitry to assist it. Stark also begins to pilot a remote-controlled Iron Man armor, but when faced with the Masters of Silence, the [[telepresence]] suit proves inadequate. Stark then designs a more heavily armed version of the suit to wear, the "Variable Threat Response Battle Suit", which becomes known as the [[War Machine|War Machine armor]]. 

Ultimately, the damage to his nervous system is too extensive. Faking his death, Stark places himself in [[suspended animation]] to heal as Rhodes takes over the running of Stark Enterprises and the mantle of Iron Man using the War Machine armor. Stark ultimately makes a full recovery by using the chip to reprogram himself and reassumes the Iron Man identity. When Rhodes learns that Stark has manipulated his friends by faking his own death, he becomes enraged and the two friends part ways, Rhodes continuing as War Machine in a solo career. 

A schism within the Avengers following the events of the [[Kree]]-[[Shi'ar]] War ("[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]") and the later [[Bloodties (comics)]] storyline leads to a difference of opinion regarding the future of the Avengers' [[West Coast Avengers|west coast branch]]. Iron Man leaves the team and forms a new superhero group, [[Force Works]], funded by Tony Stark and comprised of ex-Avengers. However, tensions within that team soon lead to his resignation from it, and Iron Man attempts a reconciliation with the Avengers.

===The Crossing and Heroes Reborn===
[[Image:Im324.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Iron Man'' Vol. 1, #324 (January 1996). The Avengers vs. Tony Stark.<br>Art by [[Jim Cheung]].]]
It is revealed soon after in a controversial storyline called "The Crossing" that a traitor is among the Avengers' ranks, and it turns out to be none other than Iron Man himself. It appears that the villain [[Kang the Conqueror]] has been manipulating Stark for years, using him as a sleeper agent, and causing him to push aside his friends and unconsciously serve Kang. Stark, fully in Kang's thrall, kills Marilla, the nanny of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'s daughter Luna, as well as Rita DeMara, the female [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]], then an ally of the Avengers. (It is revealed later, during the ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' miniseries, that these events are really due to the machinations of a disguised [[Immortus]], not Kang, and the mental control had only gone back for a few months).

The story continues in "Timeslide". Needing help to defeat both Stark and Kang, the team travel back in time and recruit a teenage Tony Stark from an alternate timeline to assist them. "Teen Tony" steals a suit of Stark's armor to aid the Avengers against his older self, and the sight of his younger self shocks the older Stark enough for him to regain momentary control of his actions, and he sacrifices his life to stop Kang. "Teen Tony" later builds his own suit to become the "new" Iron Man. The teenage Stark remains in the present day and legally regains control of his company.

During the battle with the creature called [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], "Teen Tony" dies, along with many of his teammates and allies from the Avengers and Fantastic Four.  However, [[Franklin Richards]] preserves these "dead" heroes in the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" pocket universe, in which Tony Stark is once again an adult and a hero.  The reborn adult Stark, upon returning to the normal Marvel Universe, retains the memories of both the original and teenage Tony Stark, and considers himself to have been both of them. With the aid of law firm [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Nelson & Murdock]], he successfully regains his fortune and sets up a new company (during his "death", Stark Enterprises had been sold to the Fujikawa Corporation), Stark Solutions. He also returns from the pocket universe with a fully-restored living heart. After the Avengers reform, Stark demands that a hearing be convened to look into his actions just prior to the Onslaught incident. Cleared of wrongdoing, he rejoins the Avengers.

===The new millennium===
[[Image:Imv3no30.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Iron Man'' Vol. 3, #30 (July 2000). The Sentient Armor. Art by [[Joe Quesada]].]]
At one point, Tony's armor itself becomes sentient, despite fail-safes to prevent its increasingly sophisticated computer systems from doing so. Stark's safeguards are corrupted accidentally when he uses the armor to download the mind of the android [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] to save her. Jocasta is the creation of the rogue android [[Ultron]], and unknown even to her, embedded in all of Ultron's creations is the Ultron Imperative, a command that would compel them to rebuild Ultron whenever he is destroyed. The Ultron Imperative acts like a [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]], infecting the armor's on-board systems. Combined with an electrical attack by the villain Whiplash that sent Stark into [[cardiac arrest]], it causes the armor's computer to become self-aware. Initially, Stark welcomes this "living" armor, as it has improved tactical abilities, but soon the armor's behavior begins to grow more aggressive, and it even commits murder. Eventually, the armor reaches the point where it wants to join with Stark and eventually replace him, like Ultron wishes to do with his creator [[Henry Pym]].

Stark finds he cannot defeat the armor, but in the final confrontation on a desert island, Stark suffers another heart attack. To save its creator's life, the armor gives up part of its components to give Stark a new, artificial heart, sacrificing its own existence. The new heart does not have an internal power supply, so Stark becomes once again dependent on periodic recharging. 

The sentient armor incident so disturbs Stark that he goes back to using an early model version of his armor for a while. He also dabbles with using liquid metal circuitry known as S.K.I.N. that will form itself into a protective shell around his body, but eventually returns to more conventional hard metal armors. 

During this time, Stark engages in a romance with [[Rumiko Fujikawa]], (first appearance in ''Iron Man'' Vol. 3, #4), a wealthy heiress and daughter of the man who had taken over his company during the "Heroes Reborn" period.  An intelligent and resourceful woman, she nonetheless begins the relationship in part to rebel against her stern father, who disapproves of Stark.  Her relationship with Stark endures many highs and lows, including an infidelity with Stark's rival, Tiberius Stone, in part because the fun-loving Rumiko believes that Stark is too serious and dull.  Their relationship ends with Rumiko's death at the hands of an Iron Man impostor in Vol. 3, #87.
[[Image:IM78.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Promotional art for ''Iron Man'' Vol. 3, #78. Art by Adi Granov. This "[[ablative armor|ablative]]" armor is a mid-2000s version of Iron Man's suit, with most of those armors themselves going through small variations over the years.]]
In the mid-2000s,{{issue}} Stark publicly reveals his dual identity as Iron Man, not realizing that by doing so, he has invalidated the agreements protecting his armor from government duplication (since those contracts state that the Iron Man armor would be used by an '''employee''' of Tony Stark, not by Stark himself). When he discovers that the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] is again using his technology, Stark, rather than confront them as before, accepts a [[President of the United States|Presidential]] appointment as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. (His predecessor, Dell Rusk, was the [[Red Skull]] in disguise). In this way, he hopes to monitor and direct how his designs are used. 

Stark continues to act as Iron Man while carrying out his government duties, until being forced to resign after a seemingly drunken tirade against the [[Latveria|Latverian]] Ambassador at the [[United Nations]]. The tirade is actually induced by the [[Scarlet Witch]], who has gone insane (see ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''). This incident is part of a series of events culminating in the deaths of three Avengers, the destruction of Avengers Mansion, and the disbanding of the Avengers themselves. In the aftermath, Stark claims publicly he will stand down as Iron Man, although adding, there will "always be an Iron Man". 

The "new" Iron Man remains Stark, but the catastrophic events that preceded this, combined with Stark's assertion, convinces the public that Iron Man and Stark are now different people. Stark leaves the wreckage of Avengers Mansion as it is, and unveils [[Stark Tower]], a state-of-the-art office building that becomes headquarters for the new Avengers team, of which he is a member.

In the "Extremis" story arc by writer [[Warren Ellis]] (''Iron Man'' Vol. 4, #1-6), Stark is working on a way to improve the armor's response speed when he is called upon to track Mallen, a terrorist who has ingested the powerful "Extremis" [[nanorobotics|techno-organic virus]]. This virus turns Mallen into an almost indestructible living weapon, and he subsequently goes on a deadly rampage. After being beaten nearly to death trying to stop him, Stark himself ingests a modified version of Extremis in an effort to save his own life, merging with and directly integrating the armor into his biological systems (see [[#Powers and abilities|below]]).

The miniseries ''Iron Man: The Inevitable'' openly addresses the fact that since the new millennium began, Iron Man has not clashed with any of his classic "supervillain" enemies, and reintroduces the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]], the [[Living Laser]] and [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]]. Presenting the change in status quo — the focus of Iron Man stories shifting from superheroism to political and industrial tales — as Iron Man having elevated himself to a new place in his life where he is "beyond" apprehending supervillains, the miniseries sees a resentful Spymaster conspire to drag Iron Man back to that plebeian level.

===Civil War===

In ''[[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' #1 (June 2006), it is revealed that years before, in the wake of the [[Kree-Skrull War]], Stark initiates a meeting in Wakanda with [[Professor X]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Doctor Strange]], and [[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Namor]] to form a clandestine, unnamed group to devise strategy and policy regarding overarching menaces (the "[[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]]"). Stark's original goal is to create a governing body for all superheroes in the world to answer to (with him most likely being the head of that group by his mannerism during the meeting). However, the different beliefs and philosophies, besides the fact that many heroes choose to conceal their real identities, makes Stark's plan impractical. Despite this, the group agrees to share vital information.

Learning of the government's plans to instigate a [[Registration Acts (comics)|Super-human Registration Act]] that would force costumed, super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government and sign on as licensed agents, Iron Man at first seeks to defeat the proposal, even going to such lengths as to hire the [[Titanium Man]] to attack the hearing on the act as he testifies in order to manipulate opinion in his favor. However, at some point, Tony Stark's opinion of the Act changes, seeing it as a new means to achieve the goal that he had sought in forming the "Illuminati", and to tie the knots of friendship between humans and superheroes.  He attempts to convince the other members of the clandestine group to support the new Act, stating that their input could prevent the Act from becoming too restrictive of superhuman activities, but all except Mister Fantastic reject the idea of registration. 

In ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', a battle in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] between the [[New Warriors]] and several supervillains results in the criminal [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] detonating his body to cause a massive explosion on the grounds of a public school, killing several hundred bystanders including 60 children, as well as all participants of the battle except for Nitro and New Warrior [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]]. This disaster turns public opinion against superhumans and fast-tracks the Act into law. Stark comes out publicly in support of the Act, but the new law splits the hero community in two. Stark becomes the leader and public face of the pro-registration side. In his first major public action as a supporter of registration, he again unmasks as Iron Man (''Civil War: Front Line'' #1).
[[Image:Capironfight.png|200px|right|thumb|Promotional art for ''Iron Man/Captain America: Casualties of War'' #1.<br>Art by [[Jim Cheung]].]]
Prior to the events of Civil War, Stark assists fellow Avenger [[Spider-Man]] and his family. Spider-Man comes to regard Stark as a mentor, becomes his assistant, and accepts a new technologically-enhanced costume from him. Stark also convinces Spider-Man to unmask and go public with his identity as well. However, Spider-Man's feelings of being manipulated and unease about the rightness of Stark's cause grow until Stark reveals a prison for superhumans he and Mister Fantastic have built in the [[Negative Zone]]. When Spider-Man attempts to escape from the Stark Tower, along with his family, in order to join the Resistance, he is attacked by Stark, who had confronted him. However, due to Spider-Man's override of the suit given to him by Stark and some unexpected intervention by the [[Punisher]], the web-slinger manages to escape with his family and is now considered a traitor by Stark and the Pro-Registration side. 

Another incident in which Stark is directly involved is the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] after being struck down by a clone of Thor, utilizing the Thunderbolts and other super-villains as a task force to hunt down unregistered heroes and even using the [[Green Goblin]] as a weapon against them. Unknown to Stark, the Green Goblin is no longer under his control and is seeking his own agenda. In ''New Avengers #24'' he went to the moon where the Sentry is visiting the Inhumans. He personally invited the Sentry to join his team, telling him that Stark may not be around to see the end of the Civil War and he will need some stronger heroes to be there if this were to happen. The Sentry followed Iron Man back to Earth, where he supposedly joins his side. Maria Hill suggests that Tony might become the next acting head of S.H.I.E.L.D.  She puts forward his higher qualification than hers, and the fact that it would "piss the right people off." Iron Man has a parlay with Captain America in "Casualties of War" during which he sheds his armor and fights Captain America in hand to hand combat. Tony Stark is beaten and the two part ways knowing that their old friendship has been shattered. Tony Stark has also used the suit that he built for Spider-Man to analyze his spider sense. Stark has now incorporated into his armor its own danger sense and a mechanism for falsely triggering or nullifying Spider-Man's own spider sense.
Currently, he and the Pro-Registration faction face off against Captain America and his Anti-Registration forces in the Negative Zone Prison. Though it initially appeared that Iron Man's side is numerically superior, the odds are leveled when the prisoners are released from their cells and join Captain America's side.

During the battle Iron Man is attacked by Vision, who deactivates his armour. This move is planned by Captain America who says that he is fighting dirty now. Stark is badly beaten by Cap, but his opponent is unable to strike a deadly blow. Paramedics, firefighters and NYPD physically intervened by restraining Cap. While being restrained, he came to his senses due to his resistance; causing extreme damage to Manhattan as unauthorized combatants. Overwhelmed with despair, Cap immediately surrendered to the NYPD as Steve Rogers, acknowledging that he lost the argument. Iron Man's side has won the war and now Stark is putting his project called "The Initiative" into action.

===Post Civil War=== 
In Civil War issue 7 it is revealed that Tony Stark has become the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Armor===
{{See also|Iron Man's armor}}
A notable element of the character is that, unlike other superheroes, his appearance and abilities are continually in flux as Stark continually modifies and upgrades his equipment. This is most obvious with the regularly changing appearance of his [[power armor|armor]]. The Iron Man armor was originally grey, but Stark found that this appearance frightened the public, so he spray-painted it gold (''Tales of Suspense'' #40). This bulky armor was changed in ''Tales of Suspense'' #48 into a more-form fitting design, sporting a red and gold color scheme that it has mostly retained since. One notable exception is the "Silver Centurion" armor, with a red and silver color scheme, created for use against Obadiah Stane's Iron Monger suit and retained until the end of the first Armor Wars.

Iron Man's powers and abilities derive from the advanced powered armor that he wears. The armor has evolved from a bulky iron suit to a molecularly aligned matrix of crystallized iron enhanced by magnetic fields over layers of other metals like titanium, creating a shell that is pliable, yet capable of great resilience and protection. The suit grants him superhuman strength and flight capabilities, and is powered by a combination of [[solar power|solar converters]], electrical batteries and an on-board generator that uses [[beta particle]] absorption as a fuel source. The suit is also able to convert nearby energy sources, such as heat or kinetic energy into electricity, or even drain electrical energy directly into the batteries for recharge. The suit can be completely sealed for operations in vacuum or underwater, providing its own life support, and is shielded against radiation.

The onboard systems of the armor are controlled by Tony Stark's brain patterns, read from a cybernetic interface in his helmet. Sophisticated computers with an [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[operating system]] of Stark's own design provide tactical information as well as constant feedback on the suit's status, using internal and external sensors. As noted above, Stark has tried to put safeguards in to make sure that the systems do not actually achieve sentience, although these were once circumvented.
[[Image:Im218.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Debut of Hydro-Armor: ''Iron Man'' Vol. 1, #218 (May 1987). Cover art by M.D. Bright.]]
The weapons systems of the suit have evolved over the years, but Iron Man's standard offensive weapons have always been the repulsor rays that are fired from the palms of his gauntlets. Other weapons built into various incarnations of the armor include the unibeam projector in its chest; pulse bolts that pick up kinetic energy along the way, so that they hit harder the further they have to travel; an [[electromagnetic pulse]] generator and an energy shield.  Other capabilities include generation of ultra-freon, creating and manipulating of magnetic fields, sonic blasts and a holographic generator to create decoys.
[[Image:Hulkbuster.gif|thumb|right|160px|Hulkbuster armor. Art by  [[Kevin Hopgood]].]]
In addition to the general purpose model he wears, Stark has developed several specialized [[space suit|suits]] for [[space travel]], [[atmospheric diving suit|deep-sea diving]], [[stealth technology|stealth]] and other situations. Stark has modified suits like the "Hulkbuster" heavy armor, composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its strength and durability to allow it to take on the Incredible [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. A later model designed for use against Thor is modelled on the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] and uses a mystical power source. Stark also developed an electronics pack during the Armor Wars that, when attached to armors that use Stark technology, will burn out those components and render the suit useless. This pack is ineffective on later models, however.   

After being critically injured during a battle with the Extremis-enhanced Mallen, Stark injects his nervous system with a modified techno-organic virus that not only saves his life, but also fuses Stark's armor to his body. This allows him to store the inner layers of the Iron Man armor in the hollows of his bones as well as control it through direct brain impulses. He is also able to remotely connect to external communications systems such as satellites, cellular phones, and computers throughout the world. Because the armor's operating system is now directly connected to Stark's nervous system, its response time has been significantly improved.

===Skills===
Apart from the powers granted him by the suit, Stark is an inventive genius, constantly creating new technology and looking for ways to improve it.  This extends to his ingenuity dealing with difficult foes and [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]], where he is capable of using his suit in unorthodox and effective ways. He is well-respected in the business world, able to command people's attentions when he speaks on economic matters. He is known for the loyalty he commands from and returns to those who work for him, as well as impeccable business ethics. He also strives to be environmentally responsible in his businesses, and in one case, immediately fired an employee who made profitable but illegal sales to [[Doctor Doom]].

When Stark was unable to use his armor for a period of time, he asked Captain America for combat training and has become physically formidable on his own.

==Other versions of Iron Man==
The [[Marvel Multiverse]] contains a number of alternative continuities beyond the main [[Marvel Universe]] (known as  [[Earth-616]]). Many of these have versions of Anthony Stark and/or Iron Man.

===Ultimate Iron Man===
:'' See also: [[Ultimate Iron Man]] for information on the two Ultimate Iron Man miniseries.''
[[Image:UltimateIronMan.jpg|170px|left|thumb|Promotional art for Ultimate Iron Man #1, by Andy Kubert, Danny Miki and Richard Isanove.]]The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of '''Iron Man''' first appears in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' #4, written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Mike Allred]]. He later appeared in the [[Ultimates]] and often appears in the same titles they do. In the Ultimate Universe, Antonio "Tony" Stark is a wealthy business tycoon and inventor who created the Iron Man power armor. Like his mainstream counterpart, Tony has a drinking problem and life-threatening affliction; in this case an inoperable [[brain]] [[tumor]] which will kill him anytime between six months and five years, which he explains is the reason he has become a philanthropist and superhero. Stark's early life and origins are explored in the ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' miniseries.

Stark's genius is attributed to the fact that he was infected with a regenerative virus while in his mother's womb, which facilitated the spread of undifferentiated neural tissue throughout his body, in effect making his entire body part of his brain. However, this brings with it an overstimulation of his neural cells, causing excruciating pain whenever his skin comes into contact with anything, even dust. To save the infant Tony's life, his father Howard Stark applied an experimental bacterial coating all over his body, which grants him a certain degree of protection. However, it is unable to prevent the chronic, constant pain within his body, and the coating can be washed off. In part, this motivates him to create a stronger, more durable form of armour in the form of Iron Man.
Stark's dual identity as Iron Man is public knowledge. The Ultimate Iron Man armor is more finicky and requires a considerably larger crew to operate than that found in the regular Marvel Universe, but serves as Stark International's corporate mascot. It's also noticeably bulkier, with more of a "wearable fighter-plane" feel rather than a skintight suit. . Despite his public image as a thrill-seeking playboy, Stark is an inventive genius and rates amongst the greatest minds in the Ultimate Universe.
When Stark heard Nick Fury was assembling a team of super-heroes, Tony volunteered his services. After helping defeat the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]], Tony developed a friendship with [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. He has since captured the Rhino, battled Chitauri spaceships, stole aboard a [[Kree]] spacecraft, and decapitated a Silver Surfer as a member of the [[Ultimates]].

Stark fell in love with and proposed to Natasha Romanova, the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]]. Just prior to proposing, Stark gave her a black suit of armor, almost identical to his own.  The flight test of the suit included flying over her homeland, where Stark had paid thousands of people to stand in a field so that she could see his proposal, she immediately accepted. When the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] invade America, the Widow shoots [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]] and then tries to get Stark, at gunpoint, to transfer much of his fortune to her. However, Stark has ultimate control of the [[nanotechnology|nanites]] in her bloodstream that allows her to interface with her armor. Using these nanites, Stark incapacitates Romanova and retrieves the enemy plans from her mind with the intention of fighting back against the Liberators.  He takes Iron Man 6, a massive helicarrer-sized ship armed with dozens of laser cannons and machine guns, and wipes out the air force of the Liberators in Washington, D.C. and then heads to New York to aid the heroes there.

'''Iron Maniac''' is an evil [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Iron Man.  He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (Vol. 3) #2, wearing armor that bears heavy resemblance to that of [[Doctor Doom]] (and is because of that mistaken for that villain).

He comes from an alternate reality where most of the Avengers were killed when they encountered the vicious alien [[Titannus]] in space, while a power-hungry [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] turned his back to the surviving heroes. Scarred for life due to an attack from the [[Human Torch]], Iron Man set his own operation base in Latveria for the express purpose of "take over the world to save it from Richards," until Richards somehow managed to banish him into [[Earth 616]].
 
After being transported to Earth 616, the alternate Iron Man fought [[Spider-Man]] and [[X-23]], believing that Mister Fantastic was the same evil lunatic from his home dimension. After the appearance of [[Captain America]] and [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]], he realized that he was in an alternate world and was defeated, shortly after warning the other heroes of the Titannus War. 

Titannus soon arrived and fought the heroes while the alternate Iron Man was incapacitated. When Titannus' comatose lover was revived, she told him that she never loved him and that he was insane, causing Titannus to kill himself. The alternate Iron Man later discovered from Spider-Man and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] that the Avengers were never massacred in space in this reality because the group had been [[Avengers Disassembled|disassembled]], thus never encountering Titannus and averting the so-called 'Titannus War'. 

He has recently broken free from captivity, having immunized himself to the gas that was used to keep him sedated onboard the SHIELD Helicarrier.
In the process he gained the unwilling alliance of the [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]]. Having convinced her that he is the "real" Tony, the AU Tony Stark erased her memories, and reshaped the former LMD into an advanced suit of armor. This armor, even more advanced than the current Iron Man suit, is able to replicate any weapon from the wearer's memory.

The name '''Iron Maniac''' was how he decided to call himself, due to being the "sole survivor of a sane world living in a backwards, insane world,".

Iron Maniac is known to be at least partially cyborgized, with armor plating implanted in his chest (revealed during his escape from the Helicarrier, when he was shot with a bullet). It is unknown whether the rest of his body is similarly armored or if he possesses other cybernetic enhancements.

Later, his headquarters was revealed to be the old [[Godzilla comics|Godzilla]] fighting [[mecha]], the Red Ronin, which he used to delay the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] attack until the coming of [[Galactus]], sacrificing his life in the process. He later became part of the angelic Avenging Host of [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Mar-vell's]] "Paradise", with an Iron Man motif.

===Toys=== 
Toy Biz has produced Iron Man figures based on the 1994 Iron Man cartoon, all with [[vac-metallized]], detachable armor parts. A fifth assortment, which never became openly available, appears on the collectibles market.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The [[Minimates|Marvel Minimates]] action-figure line features four Iron Man armors.

Iron Man is featured as one of the available characters to choose from in the Marvel Heroes version of [[Guess Who?]]

===Television and direct-to-video===
Iron Man has appeared in many [[animated television series]], including his own in [[1966 in television|1966]] (the 1966 series, ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (animation)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' featured [[John Vernon]] as the voice of Iron Man) and [[1994 in television|1994]]. In [[1981 in television|1981]], Iron Man appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' ([[William H. Marshall]] provided Iron Man's voice).[[Image:Ironamachine.jpg‎|thumb|200px|left|Iron Man, as he appeared in the ''Iron Man animated series''.]] In the 1990s, he also appeared in the ''[[The Avengers: United We Stand|Avengers]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|Spider-Man]]'' animated series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and the ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|Hulk]]'' animated series on [[UPN]].

The 1994 [[Iron Man (animated series)|''Iron Man'' animated series]], with [[Robert Hays]] voicing  Iron Man, was part of the ''Marvel Action Hour'', which packaged several animated versions of Marvel series, including the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 animated series)|Fantastic Four]]'', with two half-hour episodes from different series. Iron Man's origin was changed for this series. Instead of a shrapnel near his heart, Stark had multiple slivers near his spine, threatening [[paralysis]]. Also, Stark and Yinsen were held captive not by Wong Chu but by the Mandarin, who had been altered by his rings to have green skin and greater physical strength. The Mandarin led a group of villains, consisting of [[Dreadknight]], [[Hypnotia]], [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]], [[Blacklash]], [[Grey Gargoyle]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], [[M.O.D.O.K.]] and Justin Hammer against Iron Man and a team based on [[Force Works]].

===Popular culture===
The [[rapping|rapper]] [[Ghostface Killah]], a member of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], titled his [[1996 in music|1996]] debut solo album ''Ironman'', and has since continued to use lyrics related to the Iron Man comics and [[sampling (music)|samples]] from the animated TV shows on his records.  He has also adopted the nickname Tony Starks ''(cq)'' as one of his numerous alter-egos, and the title of his [[2004 in music|2004]] release ''The Pretty Toney Album'' is believed to come from a stylization of this.

One episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' featured an offscreen debate between [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[George Costanza]] about whether or not Iron Man wore underwear, to which George responded "and I still say he's naked under there!" In ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #1, Tony Stark mentally runs through a list of people he has to contact and thinks, "I really have to drop him [Jerry] a note about that underwear thing".

Reports vary{{Fact|date=February 2007}} on whether or not the [[Black Sabbath]] song "Iron Man", about a superpowered madman who "kills the people he once saved", was inspired by the hero.

[[Paul McCartney]]'s song "Magneto and Titanium Man" was inspired by the [[X-Men]]'s arch-nemesis and the original version of the Iron Man villain. Another Iron Man villain, the Crimson Dynamo, is mentioned in the lyrics to this song.

In the 2005 film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', Andy, played by [[Steve Carell]] has a toy collection that includes an Iron Man [[action figure]]. When he refuses to let go of his collectibles, his girlfriend Trish, played by [[Catherine Keener]], assures him, "I can be Iron Man, I can be Thor...."

[[Forbes|Forbes.com]] has listed him as #8 on its list of most-wealthy fictional characters.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/20/tony-stark-money-tech-media_cx_mh_06fict15_iron.html  Forbes.com: "The Forbes Fictional 15" (Nov. 20, 2006)]</ref>

===Other===
Iron Man is a fairly regular character in Twisted ToyFare Theater, a comic made using toys and [[Adobe Photoshop]] that appears monthly in the magazine [[ToyFare]]. He is depicted as constantly intoxicated and usually has a beer in hand. His drinking usually gets him in trouble. In one issue, he bet on a wrestling match between two versions of Spider-Man and lost Stark Industries to [[Boss Hogg]]. In another, he resolves to quit drinking after being given an ultimatum to sober up or be kicked out of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], until the [[Incredible Hulk]] brings over a bunch of [[Party of Five]] episodes. After Iron Man drinks until he passes out with his head in the refrigerator, the Hulk takes his suit to impersonate him at the Avengers meeting, but ends up at [[Super Friends|The Hall of Justice]] instead. Due to licensing issues with DC Comics, this was later changed to the [[X-Mansion]] when the comic was reprinted in a collected volume.
