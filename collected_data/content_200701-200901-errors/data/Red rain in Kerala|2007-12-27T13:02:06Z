From [[25 July]] to [[23 September]] [[2001]], '''red rain''' sporadically fell on the southern [[India|Indian]] state of '''[[Kerala]]'''. Heavy downpours occurred in which the [[rain]] was coloured red, staining clothes with an appearance similar to that of blood.<ref name="gentleman">{{cite web | last = Gentleman  | first = Amelia | coauthors = Robin McKie | year = 2006 | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1723913,00.html | title = Red rain could prove that aliens have landed | publisher = Guardian Unlimited | accessdate = March 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Yellow, green, and black rain was also reported.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/07/29/stories/0229000p.htm JULY 28, 2001, The Hindu: Multicolour rain]</ref>

It was initially suspected that the rains were coloured by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst, but a study commissioned by the [[Government of India]] found that the rains had been coloured by airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial [[algae|alga]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/iamgoddard/SampathAbstract.pdf Abstract] of official report.</ref> Then in early 2006, the coloured rains of Kerala suddenly rose to worldwide attention after media reports of a conjecture that the coloured particles were [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] cells, proposed by [[Godfrey Louis]] and Santhosh Kumar of the [[Mahatma Gandhi University]] in [[Kottayam]]. The terrestrial origins of the solid material in the red rain were supported by an investigation into the [[Isotopic signature|isotopic ratios]] of nitrogen and carbon.<ref name="isotope">{{cite journal |last=DiGregorio |first=Barry E. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |month= |title=What made the rain red in India?

==The rain==
[[Image:Location of Kottayam Kerala.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Kottayam district]] in Kerala, which experienced the most intense red rainfall]]
The coloured rain of Kerala first fell on [[25 July]] [[2001]], in the districts of Kottayam and [[Idukki]] in the southern part of the state. Some reports suggested that other colours of rain were also seen.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ramakrishnan | first = Venkitesh | year = 2001 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1465036.stm | title = Coloured rain falls on Kerala | publisher = BBC | accessdate = March 6 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Many more occurrences of the red rain were reported over the following ten days, and then with diminishing frequency until late September.

According to locals, the first coloured rain was preceded by a loud [[thunder]]clap and flash of light, and followed by groves of trees shedding shrivelled grey "burnt" leaves.  Shrivelled leaves and the disappearance and sudden formation of [[water well|well]]s were also reported around the same time in the area.<ref name="indiatoday">{{cite web | last = Radhakrishnan | first = M.

The colouration of the rain was due to red particles in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in the rain water, and the red rain was at times as strongly coloured as [[blood]]. It typically fell over small areas, no more than a few [[square kilometre]]s in size, and was sometimes so localised that normal rain could be falling just a few metres away from the red rain. Red rainfalls typically lasted less than 20 minutes.<ref name="L&K 2006">Louis G. & Kumar A.S. (2006). The red rain phenomenon of Kerala and its possible extraterrestrial origin.

==Official report==
[[Image:RRR-004.jpg|left|thumb|Photomicrograph of particles from red rain sample]]
Initially the [[Centre for Earth Science Studies]] (CESS) had suggested that the cause of the red rain was an exploding meteor. A few days later, when the red rain continued to fall, they retracted this. (Clearly debris from a meteor wouldn't have continued to fall in the same area.) Instead, the announcement jointly from the CESS and the [[Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute]] (TBGRI) concluded that the particles colouring the rainwater were some type of [[spore]].<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie20010806/nat10.html Monday, August 6, 2001: ‘Red rain was fungus, not meteor’]</ref>  Then in November of 2001, commissioned by the [[Government of India]]'s Department of Science & Technology, the CESS and TBGRI released a report which concluded that Kerala's rains were coloured by [[algae|algal]] spores, which were successfully grown in medium into [[lichen]] associated algae of the genus ''[[Trentepohlia]]''. Although red or orange, ''Trentepohlia'' is a [[Chlorophyta|Chlorophyte]] green alga which can grow abundantly on tree bark or damp soil and rocks, but is also the photosynthetic [[symbiosis|symbiont]] or photobiont of many lichens, including some of those abundant on the trees in [[Changanacherry]] area.<ref name="Sampath">Sampath S., Abraham T.K., Sasi Kumar V., Mohanan C.N. (2001), ''Coloured rain: a report on the phenomenon'', Centre for Earth Science Studies</ref>  

[[Image:WaterSample.jpg|thumb|Rain water sample (left) and after the particles settled (right). Dried sediment (center).]]
The report also stated that there was no dust of meteoric, volcanic or desert origin present in the rainwater, and that the colour of the rainwater was not due to any dissolved gases or pollutants. The report suggested that heavy rains in Kerala in the weeks preceding the red rains could have caused the widespread growth of lichens, which had given rise to a large quantity of spores in the atmosphere. However, it found no definite mechanism for the apparent extraordinary dispersal of the suspect spores, nor for the uptake of the suspect spores into clouds.

The authors of the report analysed some sediment collected from the red rains, using a combination of ion-coupled plasma [[Mass Spectrometer|mass spectrometry]], atomic absorption spectrometry and wet chemical methods. The major elements found are listed below.

The presence of aluminium and the very low content of [[phosphorus]] is puzzling because aluminium is not ordinarily found in living cells, while normally about 3% phosphorus can be expected in the dry weight of biological cells.<ref>{{cite web| last =Todar| first =Kenneth| year = 2005| url =http://textbookofbacteriology.net/environment.html| title = Procaryotes in the Environment| work =Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology| accessdate =June 2|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The CESS analysis also showed significant amounts of [[heavy metals]] in the red raindust, including [[nickel]] (43), [[manganese]] (59), [[titanium]] (321), [[chromium]] (67) and [[copper]] (55) (amounts in ppm), though the report does not comment on this.

==Conventional theories==
[[Image:Red rain Kerala optical microscope.jpg|thumb|Photomicrograph of particles from red rain sample]]

History records many instances of unusual objects falling with the rain — in 2000, in an example of [[raining animals]], a small [[waterspout]] in the [[North Sea]] sucked up a school of [[fish]] a mile off shore, depositing them shortly afterwards on [[Great Yarmouth]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Lane | first = Megan | date = [[2000-08-07]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/869482.stm | title = It's raining fish! | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2006-03-06}}</ref> Coloured rain is by no means rare, and can often be explained by the transport of [[dust]] from [[desert]] regions in [[high pressure area]]s, where it mixes with water droplets.  One such case occurred in [[England]] in 1903, when dust was carried from the [[Sahara]] and fell with rain in February of that year.

At first, the red rain in Kerala was attributed to the same effect, with dust from the deserts of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] initially the suspect.  [[LIDAR]] observations had detected a cloud of dust in the atmosphere near Kerala in the days preceding the outbreak of the red rain <ref name="Satyanarayana">Satyanarayana M., Veerabuthiran S., Ramakrishna Rao D., Presennakumar B. (2004), ''Colored Rain on the West Coastal Region of India: Was it Due to a Dust Storm?'', Aerosol Science and Technology, v.38, p.24–26</ref>.  However, this hypothesis could not explain certain aspects of the red rain, such as its sudden onset and gradual decline over two months, and its localisation to Kerala despite atmospheric conditions that should have seen it occur in neighbouring states as well.

Another theory is that the rain contained mammalian blood, a large flock of [[bat]]s having been killed at high altitude, perhaps by a [[meteor]]{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. Some bat species in India live in very large communities. However, no bat wings or other remains were found raining from the sky, and no known natural process would separate the red blood cells from white cells, platelets and other blood components. Red blood cells disintegrate rapidly in regular rainwater because of osmosis, but this was not evident with the red particles.<ref name="tmcnet 2006">[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/03/03/1427866.htm It's raining aliens] — transcript of a [[New Scientist]] [[podcast]] [http://www.newscientist.com/podcast.ns - get podcast here]</ref>  Furthermore it would have had to be a sizeable quantity of bats to cover a province of India.<ref>{{cite journal

==Extraterrestrial hypothesis==
{{see|Panspermia}}

[[Image:Red rain Kerala SEM.png|right|thumb|Grains under a [[scanning electron microscope]]]] 

Another hypothesis was proposed in 2003 by [[Godfrey Louis]] and [[Santhosh Kumar|A. Santhosh Kumar]], two scientists at [[Mahatma Gandhi University]] in [[Kottayam]], Kerala.  Having collected samples of the [[rainwater]] at many locations, Louis and Kumar claimed that the red particles did not look like dust but instead appeared to be biological cells. [[Chemical]] analyses indicate that they consist of [[organic material]], and so they proposed that the particles may be [[microbes]] of [[Outer space|extraterrestrial]] origin.

Louis and Kumar's analysis found that the red particles were typically 4 to 10 [[micrometre|µm]] across, spherical or oval in shape, and similar in appearance to [[unicellular organism]]s. On average, 1 [[millilitre]] of rain water was found to contain 9 million [[red]] particles, and the weight of particles in each [[litre]] of rainwater was about 100 [[milligram]]s. [[Extrapolating]] these figures to the total amount of red rain estimated to have fallen, Louis and Kumar calculated that a total weight of some 50,000 [[kilogram]]s of red particles had fallen over [[Kerala]].

[[Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] analysis showed that the particles were composed of mostly [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]], with trace amounts of [[silicon]] and [[iron]] (see table).

A [[CHN analyzer]] showed 43.03% [[carbon]], 4.43% [[hydrogen]], and 1.84% [[nitrogen]].

Louis and Kumar performed tests with [[ethidium bromide]] in an attempt to detect any [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] was present in the red particles, but found none. Their results are published in the journal [[Astrophysics and Space Science]].<ref name="L&K 2006" /> 
[[Image:RRR-003.jpg|thumb|right|Photomicrograph of particles from red rain sample]]
Further tests on the particles were carried out at [[Sheffield University]] by Milton Wainwright, who has studied [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[spore]]s.<ref name="gentleman"/><ref name="tmcnet 2006"/>  In March 2006 he said the particles were similar in appearance to spores of a [[rust (fungus)|rust fungus]],<ref name="yorkshire">[http://www.yorkshiretoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=55&ArticleID=1375334 Is mysterious ‘red rain’ first evidence of life in space?] — [[Yorkshire Today]]</ref> later saying that he had confirmed their similarity to spores or algae, and found no evidence to suggest that the rain contained dust, sand, fat globules or blood.  He also said, “There appears to be an increasing tendency among scientists to come up with wild explanations when asked by the press to comment on unusual, novel phenomena. A good example is provided by comments about the recent Indian red rain phenomenon.”<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025455.400.html 1 April 2006, New Scientist: Red rain fantasies]</ref> A correction was printed in ''The Observer''<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1729000,00.html For the record], ''[[The Observer]]'', [[March 12]], [[2006]]</ref> regarding Dr. Wainwright's comment that the red rain lacked DNA.  Dr. Wainwright asked in the correction to make clear that he currently had no view on whether the samples contained DNA and that it was physicist Godfrey Louis who is of that view. The controversial research of Godfrey et al. is the only evidence suggesting that these organisms are of extraterrestrial organism.<ref>{{Citation

A sample of the rain was also sent to [[Cardiff University]] for analysis by noted [[panspermia]] proponent [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]].  Wickramasinghe has reported on the 30th of March 2006 that “work in progress has yielded [sic] positive for DNA”.<ref>[http://www.astrobiology.cf.ac.uk/redrain.html Cardiff Centre of Astrobiology: Analysis of red rain of Kerala]</ref>

===Possible cometary origin===
[[Image:Red rain Kerala TEM.png|thumb|A single grain viewed with a [[transmission electron microscope]], purportedly showing a detached inner capsule.]]
A few hours before the first occurrence of the red rain, a [[sonic boom]] was reported by residents of [[Changanasserry]] in Kottayam district, accompanied by a flash of light. Louis and Kumar suggest that this was caused by the disintegration of a small [[comet]] entering the Earth's atmosphere, and that this comet contained large quantities of the red particles. Observations show that 85% of the red rain fell within 10 days of [[25 July]], and Louis and Kumar suggest that this is consistent with the settling of red particles released into the upper atmosphere by a cometary break-up. Subsequent research by a different group of scientists concluded that the red particles were spores of the alga ''[[Trentepohlia]]'', but may simply be contamination from the lichens that grow abundantly in the region.<ref>Coloured Rain: A Report on the phenomenon http://www.geocities.com/iamgoddard/Sampath2001.pdf</ref>

Louis and Kumar further suggest that the particles are [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and thus represent evidence of extraterrestrial life. If the particles are biological in nature and did originate in a comet, it would be the first evidence in favour of the theory of [[panspermia]], in which life on Earth is proposed to have been carried here from elsewhere in the [[universe]]. [[Fred Hoyle]] and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] have been among the proponents of the theory, but it has been dismissed by most mainstream scientists.

==Proto-domain hypothesis== 
[[Image:FUtree.jpg|left|thumbnail|250px|The newly hypothesized [[tree of life]].]] 
Proto-domain organisms are a hypothetical group of microorganisms acknowledged by some proponents of [[panspermia]], including Godfrey et al.<ref> http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0312/0312639.pdf </ref><ref>http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/evolution/mg18925411.100</ref> It is suggested that these hypothetical organisms might share many of the same abilities as terrestrial life on [[Earth]]: [[metabolism]], [[homeostasis]], [[organization]], [[growth]], [[adaptation]], [[reproduction]], and response to stimuli. However, unlike all life thus far discovered on earth, if the objects in red rain are proto-domain organisms they would appear to lack [[DNA]] as their informational [[macromolecule]].<ref> http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0312/0312639.pdf </ref><ref>http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/060104_specksfrm1.htm</ref><ref>http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1723913,00.html</ref>

To date, red rain represents the only supposed evidence of the existence of proto-domain organisms.  Proponents of the proto-domain theory argue that the fact that the "cells" in red rain lacked DNA is evidence that they could not have been algal spores. However, mainstream scientific opinion regards the existence of proto-domain organisms as at best a hypothesis and at worst as wild speculation. <ref> http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0312/0312639.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/060104_specksfrm1.htm</ref><ref>http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1723913,00.html</ref> Critics also argue that the lack of DNA is not proof that these organisms are either prehistoric or extraterrestrial, noting, "further work in progress has yielded positive for DNA using [DAPI] staining in the cells and daughters."<ref>http://whyfiles.org/shorties/207red_rain/</ref> This identification, however, is not yet fully confirmed, and might be considered equivocal.

==Further occurrences==
Reports say that on August 21, 2007 red coloured rainfall occurred in a few places in the northern part of [[Kozhikode district]]. Places around [[Vadakara]], a [[municipality]] in Kozhikode district, which is fifty kilometres northward of Kozhikode town witnessed this phenomenon. [[Centre for Water Resources Development and Management]] (CWRDM) an agency of government of India, was reported to be awaiting samples for examination.<ref>http://www.newkerala.com/july.php?action=fullnews&id=55259</ref>
