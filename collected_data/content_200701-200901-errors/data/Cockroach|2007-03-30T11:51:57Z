'''Cockroaches''' are [[insect]]s of the Order '''Blattodea'''. The name of the order is derived from Greek for "cockroach," ''blatta''. There are roughly 3,500 species in six families. Cockroaches exist worldwide, with the exception of the polar regions. Cockroaches are also simply known as "roaches".

The English word ''cockroach'' is derived from the Spanish ''cucaracha''. 

Among the most well-known species are the [[American cockroach]], ''Periplaneta americana'', which is about 3&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] long, the [[German cockroach]], ''Blattella germanica'', about 1½&nbsp;cm long, the [[Asian cockroach]], ''Blattella asahinai'', also about 1½ cm in length, and the [[Oriental cockroach]], ''Blatta orientalis'', about 2½ cm.  [[Tropics|Tropical]] cockroaches are often much bigger, and extinct cockroach relatives such as the [[Carboniferous]] ''[[Archimylacris]]'' and the [[Permian]] ''[[Apthoroblattina]]'' were several times as large as these. When infesting buildings, cockroaches are considered [[pest (animal)|pest]]s; out of the thousands of species, however, only a handful fall into this designation. 

==Evolutionary history and relationships==
The earliest cockroach-like fossils are from the [[Carboniferous]] period between 354&ndash;295 million years ago. However, these fossils differ from modern cockroaches in having long [[ovipositor]]s and are apparently the ancestors of [[mantid]]s as well as modern cockroaches. Current evidence strongly suggests that [[termite]]s have evolved, in turn, directly from true cockroaches. The first fossils of "modern" cockroaches with short ovipositors appear in the early [[Cretaceous]]. [[Mantodea]], [[Isoptera]], and Blattodea are usually combined by [[entomologists]] into a higher group called [[Dictyoptera]].

==Biology==
Cockroaches are generally either [[scavenger]]s or [[omnivorous|omnivores]]. The exception to this is the [[wood]]-eating ''[[Cryptocercus]]'' species found in China and the United States. Although they are incapable of digesting the [[cellulose]] themselves, they have a symbiotic relationship with a [[protozoa]]n that digests the cellulose, allowing them to extract the nutrients. In this, they are similar to termites and current research suggests that the genus ''Cryptocercus'' is more closely related to [[termite]]s than it is to other cockroaches. Cockroaches are most common in tropical and [[subtropical]] climates. Some species are in close association with human dwellings and widely found around garbage or in the kitchen.

[[Image:Blatella germanica cdc.jpg|thumb|Female ''[[Blatella germanica]]'' with ootheca]]
Female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomen; the egg case of the German cockroach holds about 30&ndash;40 long, thin eggs, packed like frankfurters in the case called an [[ootheca]]. The eggs hatch from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air and are initially bright white [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] that continue inflating themselves with air and harden and darken within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while [[ecdysis|molting]] has led to many individuals claiming to have seen albino cockroaches. 

[[Image:Snodgrass common household roaches.png|thumb|left|'''Common household roaches''' A. [[German cockroach]], B. [[American cockroach]], C. [[Australian cockroach]], D&E. [[Oriental cockroach]] (♀ & ♂)]]
A female German cockroach carries an egg capsule containing around 40 eggs. She drops the capsule prior to hatching. Development from eggs to adults takes 3-4 months. Cockroaches live up to a year. The female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, it can produce 300-400 offspring. Other species of cockroach, however, can produce an extremely high number of eggs in a lifetime. Laying up to 100 eggs in each egg sac, it only needs to be impregnated once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of its life, allowing one single cockroach to lay over a million eggs during its lifespan.

The world's largest cockroach is the Australian [[giant burrowing cockroach]], which can grow to 9&nbsp;cm in length and weigh more than 30&nbsp;[[gram]]s. Comparable in size is the giant cockroach ''[[Blaberus giganteus]]'', which grows to a similar length but is not as heavy.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A peculiar exception is the [[Oriental cockroach]], which is attracted to light, thus making it a far more annoying pest. 

The cockroach is also one of the hardiest insects on the planet, capable of living for a month without food. It can also hold its breath for 45 minutes and has the ability to slow down its heart rate.

It is popularly suggested that cockroaches will "inherit the earth" if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war. Cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal dose perhaps 6 to 15 times that for humans. However, they are not exceptionally radiation-resistant compared to other insects, such as the fruit fly&nbsp;.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1567313.htm|title=Cockroaches & Radiation |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The cockroach's ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained in terms of the cell cycle. Cells are more vulnerable to effects of radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once when in its molting cycle, which at most happens weekly. The cells of the cockroach take roughly 48 hours to complete a molting cycle, which would give time enough for radiation to affect it but not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time. This would mean some would be unaffected by the initial radiation and thus survive, at least until the fallout arrived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/cockroach_faq.html#Q5 |title=Are cockroaches resistant to radation? |author =Joseph G.

==Behaviour==
Cockroaches have been shown to exhibit [[Emergence#Emergent properties|emergent behaviour]].<ref name="viegas">{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |title=Cockroaches Make Group Decisions |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |author=Jennifer Viegas |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Research being conducted at the [[University of Florida]] shows that cockroaches leave chemical trails in their feces. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. One of the major implications of this research is a new technique in cockroach pest control. Cockroaches could potentially be removed from a home by leaving a chemical trail that leads away from the home.

Research has shown that group-based decision making is responsible for more complex behavior such as resource allocation.  A study where 50 cockroaches were placed in a dish with three shelters with a capacity for 40 insects in each, the insects arranged themselves in two shelters with 25 insects in each, leaving the third shelter empty.  When the capacity of the shelters was increased to more than 50 insects per shelter, all of the cockroaches arranged themselves in one shelter.  Researchers found a balance between cooperation and competition exists in group decision-making behavior found in cockroaches.  The models used in this research can also explain the group dynamics of other insects and animals.<ref name="viegas">

== Cockroaches and health risks ==
A 2005 US national study on factors that affect asthma in inner-city children shows that cockroach allergens appear to worsen asthma symptoms more than other known triggers.  This study, funded by the [[United States|US]] [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) and the US [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID), is the first large-scale study to rank asthma triggers according to severity.

Additionally, a 2005 research study, sponsored by the National Pest Management Association (NPMA), shows a disparity in homeowner knowledge about this link.  Only 10% of homeowners nationwide feel that cockroaches are a threat to their family’s health.

==Habitat==
Cockroaches live in a wide range of environments around the world.  Pest species of cockroaches adapt readily to a variety of environments, but prefer warm conditions such as found within buildings.  Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments and do not fare well in the average household.  Only a small handful of the 3,500 or so species of cockroach are suited to thrive in the typical home.

== Interesting facts ==
Few cockroaches die on their backs in the wild.  Natural death of cockroaches probably occurs in the stomach of a bird, bat or other small animal. The reason why cockroaches sometimes die in this position is because cockroaches' legs are not adapted for traversing smooth surfaces such as polished marble or [[vinyl]] floors, thus dying of immobility and starvation. Cockroaches are adapted for a rugged natural terrain filled with leaves, sticks and other environmental debris. Thus, when a cockroach finds itself on its back it may have trouble righting itself if there is not debris around to grab hold of with its legs. It is also common to come across dead cockroaches that have died of [[insecticide]]. Most of these insecticides are [[pyrethroid]] nerve poisons.<ref>Hadlington & Gerozisis, 1995, Urban Pest Control in Australia, University of New South Wales Press Ltd.</ref> The nerve poison induces muscular spasms which often result in the cockroach flipping on its back.  Without muscular coordination, the cockroach cannot right itself and eventually dies in its upside-down position.

Cockroaches can survive on very little food; it has been discovered that cockroaches will eat the glue from the back of [[postage stamp]]s when little else is available.

<!--It has also been attested that cockroaches can survive for at least seven days, sometimes a month without a head.  This is due to four reasons: cockroaches breathe through [[spiracles]] rather than an airway in the head, breathing is not controlled by the brain, cockroaches do not need to eat often, and cockroaches do not need blood in the same way that humans do.  What is more, experiments have shown that headless cockroaches can be conditioned to avoid electric shocks more quickly than cockroaches that have their heads.[http://rudimentsofwisdom.com/pages/cockroaches.htm]

A person who is allergic to consuming [[shellfish]] is also likely to have an allergy to eating cockroaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlighthealth/2004-01-16-fear-factor_x.htm|title=Fear Factor not Afraid of Doctor |accessmonthday=24 October |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Pest control==
[[Image:Roach control.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Cockroach control, with cockroach baits, boric acid, and hydramethylnon gel.]]
There are numerous parasites and predators of cockroaches, but few of them have proven to be highly effective for biological control. [[Wasps]] in the family [[Evaniidae]] are perhaps the most effective insect predators, as they attack the egg cases, and wasps in the family [[Ampulicidae]] are predators on adult and nymphal cockroaches (e.g., ''[[Ampulex compressa]]''). The [[house centipede]], however, is probably the most effective control agent of cockroaches, though most homeowners find the centipedes themselves objectionable.
Preventative measures include keeping all food stored away in sealed containers, using garbage cans with a tight lid, frequent cleaning in the kitchen, and regular vacuuming. Any water leaks, such as dripping taps, should also be repaired. It is also helpful to seal off any entry points, such as holes around baseboards, in between kitchen cabinets, pipes, doors, and windows with some steel wool or copper mesh and some cement, putty or silicone caulk. Once a cockroach infestation occurs, chemical controls may help alleviate the problem. Bait stations, gels containing [[hydramethylnon]], as well as [[boric acid]] powder, are toxic to cockroaches. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. A simple homemade [[Vegas roach trap|Vegas cockroach trap]] is reported to be successful. Additionally, pest control products containing [[deltamethrin]] are very effective.

==Popular culture==
In popular culture, cockroaches are often regarded as vile and extremely resilient pests, due to their shiny [[exoskeleton]]s (making them look slimy, contrary to their fastidious habits), and their size, unusual for a scavenging insect. 

Movies which feature cockroaches include: 
*''[[Joe's Apartment]]'' &mdash; The bugs are cheerful, swinging party-goers who help the titular human hero.
*''[[Creepshow]]'' &mdash; Swarms of them terrorize a cantankerous and verminophobic old man.
*''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'' &mdash; A post-apocalyptic Las Vegas is infected with a flesh-eating mutant variety.
*''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' &mdash; A giant cockroach-like alien's actions threaten to lead to the destruction of the Earth.
*''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]] '' &mdash; Diseased cockroaches are the target of the genetically-altered titular species.
*''[[Team America: World Police]]'' &mdash; After his apparent death, a coachroach crawls out of [[Kim Jong-il]]'s mouth and flies away in a rocket ship, in [[parody]] of ''Men in Black''.
*''[[Twilight of the Cockroaches]]'' &mdash; An anime film in which roaches live peacefully in a bachelor's apartment until he begins dating a woman across the street, who encourages genocide of the insects.

In [[Franz Kafka]]'s [[Existentialism|existentialist]] story [[The Metamorphosis]], the character Gregor Samsa awakes to find himself transformed into a giant insect, often mislabeled as a cockroach. Actually, the type of bug in which Gregor transforms is not specified, though it is referred to as "[[vermin]]" and the little physical description offered could match either a cockroach or beetle.

In the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode "[[War of the Coprophages]]", cockroaches are seen to group together to murder people. The character Dr. Berenbaum (based on the University of Illinois entomologist) suggests that it is actually swarms of flying cockroaches that are responsible for most [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] sightings (they generate an electro-static field which can be illuminated dependent on atmospheric conditions). In one of the scenes, a cockroach that escaped can be seen crawling over the camera, making it appear that the viewer's television has become infested. Though the shot was not planned, the producers decided to leave it in the episode.

In the television show ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', Alf inadvertently releases a [[Melmac (planet)|Melmacian]] cockroach in the house.  When it is sprayed with [[insecticide]], it grows bigger until it is large enough to eat him.  He discovers that a bottle of perfume will kill the cockroach.

The famous [[Mexico|Mexican]] folk song, [[La Cucaracha]], means "The Cockroach" in Spanish, and refers to cockroaches in some of its lines.

In [[Revolt of the Cockroach People]], an autobiographical novel by [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], cockroaches are used as a metaphor for oppressed and downtrodden minorities in US society in the 1960s and 70s, particularly Mexican-Americans.  There are several references to the folk song [[La Cucaracha]] throughout the novel.

In 1987, Los Angeles rapper [[Russ Parr|Bobby Jimmy]] released the song "Roaches" as a parody of [[Timex Social Club]]'s hit song "Rumors".  Its chorus line was ''Look at all these roaches / Around me everyday / Need somethin' strong / To make 'em go away''.

The cult computer game ''[[Bad Mojo]]'' deals with a person turned into a cockroach, in clear reference to Kafka's Metamorphosis.

[[archy and mehitabel|Archy]] is a cockroach in a series of columns by [[Don Marquis]].

[[Megalon]] is a 50 meter tall cockroach that appears in several Japanese [[Godzilla]] films.

Along with rats, cockroaches are frequently seen infesting various locations in [[sam and max]] comics, and one storyline features a race of gigantic cockroaches living on the moon.

In the [[Discworld]] novel ''The Last Continent'', [[Ponder Stibbons]] is horrified to learn that the cockroach is actually the most highly evolved and advanced creature in the world, and not mankind as he had assumed.

[[Tyler Knox]] published a noir comedy in 2006 called "[[Kockroach]]" (William Morrow) in which a cockroach wakes up one morning as a man and becomes a leading gangster in [[Times Square]] during the 1950s.

Believed in [[urban legend]] to be the only surviving creatures in the event of a nuclear war.

==History==
Some of the earliest writings with regards to cockroaches encourage their use as medicine. [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (''[[1st century]]''), [[Kamal al-Din al-Damiri]] and [[Abu Hanifa ad-Dainuri]] (''[[9th century]]'') all offered medicines that either suggest grinding them up with oil or boiling. The list of ailments included earaches, open wounds and "gynecological disorders".

==Miscellaneous==
*The largest by weight is a 50&nbsp;[[gram|g]] ''[[Macropanesthia rhinoceros]]''.
*The smallest species is ''[[Attaphila fungicola]]'', reaching only 4&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]].
