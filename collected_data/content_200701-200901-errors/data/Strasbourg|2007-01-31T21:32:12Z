:''For other places named Strasburg or Straßburg see [[Strasburg]].''

'''Strasbourg''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|/stʀazbuʀ/}}) ([[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]: ''Strossburi''; [[German language|German]]: ''Straßburg'') is the capital and principal city of the [[Alsace]] ''[[List of regions in France|région]]'' of northeastern [[France]], with approximately 650,000 inhabitants in the [[aire urbaine|metropolitan area]] in [[1999]]. Located close to the border with [[Germany]], it is the ''[[préfecture]]'' (capital) of the [[Bas-Rhin]] ''[[département in France|département]]''. 

The city's Germanic name means  "town (at the crossing) of roads". ''Stras-'' is [[cognate]] to the [[English language|English]] ''street'' from the [[German]] equivalent of the word, ''Straße'', while ''-bourg'', from the German ''-[[burg]]'' ("fortress, town, citadel"), is cognate to the English ''[[borough]]''.

Strasbourg is, among other things, the seat of the [[Council of Europe]], of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], of the [[European Ombudsman]], of the [[Eurocorps]] and, perhaps most famously, of the [[European Parliament]], though the latter also holds sessions in [[Brussels]]. 

Strasbourg is an important centre <includeonly>or centER, who gives a damn ? Stop inflating your collective egos on this !</includeonly>  of manufacturing and engineering, as well as of road, rail and river communications. The [[Strasbourg port]] [http://www.strasbourg.port.fr/] is the second largest on the [[Rhine]] after [[Duisburg]]. The city is the seat of the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]].


==Geography==

Strasbourg is situated on the [[Ill, France|Ill River]], where it flows into the Rhine on the frontier with [[Germany]]. The German town across the Rhine is [[Kehl]]. The city is situated in the Rhine valley, approximately 20 kms east of the [[Vosges mountains]] and 25 kms west of the [[Black Forest]]. Winds coming from either direction being generally held up by these natural barriers, summer temperatures can be inordinately high. The defective natural ventilation also makes Strasbourg one of the most atmospherically polluted cities of France, although the progressive disappearance of heavy industry as well as effective measures of traffic regulation in and around the city are showing encouraging results.

==History==
At the site of Strasbourg, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] established a military outpost and named it ''Argentoratum''. It belonged to the ''[[Germania Superior]]'' [[Roman province]]. The name was first mentioned in the year [[12 BC]] ; in [[1988]], the city celebrated its 2000th birthday. From the [[4th century]], Strasbourg was the seat of the [[Archbishopric Strasbourg]]. 

The [[Alamanni]] fought a [[Battle of Strasbourg (357)|battle against Rome]] in Strasbourg in [[357]]. They were defeated by [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], later [[Roman Emperors|Emperor of Rome]], and their king [[Chonodomarius]] was taken prisoner. On [[January 2]], [[366]] the Alamanni crossed the frozen [[Rhine]] in large numbers, to invade the Roman Empire. Early in the [[5th century]] the Alamanni appear to have crossed the Rhine, conquered, and then settled what is today Alsace and a large part of [[Switzerland]]. 
[[Image:Strasbourg1493.png|thumb|350px|left|View of Strasbourg in [[1493]] showing the [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]

The town was occupied successively in the 5th century by Alamanni, [[Huns]] and [[Franks]], who gave it its present name. In [[842]], Strasbourg was the site of the [[Oath of Strasbourg]], the trilingual text of which is considered to contain, besides Latin and German, also the oldest written document in the [[French language]]. A major commercial centre, the town came under control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in [[923]], through the homage paid by the Duke of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] to German King [[Henry I of Germany|Henry I]]. The early history of Strasbourg consists of a long conflict between its [[Archbishopric Strasbourg|bishop]] and its citizens. The citizens emerged victorious after the [[Battle of Oberhausbergen]] in [[1262]], when King [[Philip of Swabia]] granted the city the status of an [[Imperial Free City]].

A revolution in [[1332]] resulted in a broad-based city government with participation of the [[guild]]s, and Strasbourg declared itself a free [[republic]]. The ''[[Strasbourg Cathedral|Münster]]'' begun in the 12th century, was completed in [[1439]] (though the south tower always remained unfinished), and became the [[World's Tallest Building]], surpassing the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. During the [[1520s]] the city embraced the religious teachings of [[Martin Luther]], whose adherents established a [[University of Strasbourg|university]] in the following century. Protestant [[iconoclasm]] caused a lot of destruction in churches and cloisters, though, as would nearly 300 years later [[French Revolution]]ism. Strasbourg was a centre of humanist scholarship and early bookprinting in the Holy Roman Empire and its intellectual and political influence contributed much to the establishment of Protestantism as an accepted denomination in the southwest of Germany. Together with four other free cities, Strasbourg presented the [[confessio tetrapolitana]] as her Protestant book of faith at the Imperial Diet of [[Augsburg]] in 1530, where also the slightly different [[Augsburg confession]] was handed over to the emperor.

After the reform of the Imperial constitution in the early 16th century and the establishment of "Imperial Circles" ([[Imperial Circle|Reichskreis]]e), Strasbourg was part of the "Upper Rhenish Circle", a corporation of Imperial estates in the southwest of the empire, mainly responsible for maintaining troops, supervising coining, and ensuring public security. 

During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the Free City of Strasbourg remained neutral. However, it was suddenly seized by King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of France in September [[1681]], whose unprovoked annexation was recognised by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] ([[1697]]). The official policy of religious intolerance which drove many [[Protestants]] from France after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] ([[1598]]) by the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] ([[1685]]) was not applied in Strasbourg and in Alsace. Strasbourg cathedral, however, had to be handed over from the [[Lutheran]]s to the [[Catholic]]s. The German Lutheran university persisted until the [[French revolution]]. Famous students were [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]].

[[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]] composed "[[La Marseillaise]]" on [[April 25]], [[1792]], in Strasbourg during a dinner organised by Frédéric de Dietrich, Strasbourg's mayor. However, Strasbourg's status as a free city was revoked by the French Revolution. 
[[Image:Map Strasbourg MK1888.png|thumb|300px|[[1888]] German map of Strasbourg]]
With the growth of industry and commerce, the city's population tripled in the [[19th century]] to 150,000. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the city was heavily bombed by the Prussian army : on August 24, 1870, the Museum of Fine Arts was destroyed by fire, as was the Municipal Library housed in the Gothic former Dominican Church, with its unique collection of medieval manuscripts (most famously the [[Hortus deliciarum]]), rare Renaissance books and Roman artefacts. Following the war, in [[1871]], the city was annexed to the newly-established [[German Empire]], as part of the [[Alsace-Lorraine|Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen]] ([[Treaty of Frankfurt]]) and rebuilt/extended on a grand and representative scale (the ''Neue Stadt''), including a new Museum and a new Library; the city was restored to France after [[World War I]], in [[1919]] by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]; on neither occasion were city residents offered a plebiscite. The city remained heavily German-speaking well into the twentieth century, and [[Germany]] continued to covet it under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]]. In [[1940]], following the [[Fall of France]] in [[World War II]], the city was again annexed by Germany. As one of the first official acts, the new rulers burnt and razed the main [[Synagogue]], that had been a major architectural landmark and one of the largest in Europe for the last 45 years.  After the war, it was again returned to France, under whose rule it remains. While the First World War did not damage the city, Anglo-American bombers caused a lot of destruction in 1944. Another, though unrelated tragedy, was the 1947 fire that destroyed a valuable part of the collection of the new Museum of Fine Arts.

In [[1920]], Strasbourg became the seat of the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], previously located in [[Mannheim]], one of the very first European institutions. In [[1949]], the city was chosen to be the site of the [[Council of Europe]], and since [[1979]], Strasbourg has been a seat of the [[European Parliament]], although sessions are held in Strasbourg only four days each month, with all other business being conducted in Brussels. Those sessions take place in the ''Immeuble [[Louise Weiss]]'' (also known as "IPE IV"), built in [[1998]], which houses the largest parliamentary assembly room in Europe and of any democratic institution in the world. Before that, the EP sessions had to take place in the main CoE building, the [[Palais de l'Europe]], whose unusual inner architecture had become a familiar sight to European TV audiences. In [[1992]], Strasbourg became the seat of the Franco-German TV channel and movie-production society [[Arte]].

In [[2000]], an [[Strasbourg cathedral bombing plot|Islamist plot to blow up the cathedral]] was prevented by German police.

In [[2006]], after a long and careful restoration, the inner decoration of the ''Aubette'', made in the 1920s by [[Hans Arp]], [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]] and destroyed in the 1930s, was made accessible to public again. The work of the three artists had been called " the [[Sistine Chapel]] of abstract art".

[[Image:Notre dame de strasbourg 2.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Strasbourg Cathedral|Strasbourg, Cathedral of Our Lady]].]]
===Architecture===
The city is chiefly known for its [[sandstone]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Strasbourg Cathedral|Cathedral]] with its famous [[Strasbourg astronomical clock|astronomical clock]], and for its medieval cityscape of [[Rhineland]] black and white timber-framed buildings, particularly in the ''[[Petite-France]]'' district alongside the Ill and in the streets and squares surrounding the cathedral, where the renowned ''[[Maison Kammerzell]]'' stands out. 

Strasbourg's historic centre, the ''[[Grande Île]]'' (great island), has been classified a [[World Heritage site]] by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] in 1988, the first time such an honor was placed on an entire city centre. In addition to the cathedral, Strasbourg houses several other medieval churches that have survived the many wars and destructions that have plagued the city: the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] ''Eglise Saint-Etienne'', partly destroyed in 1944 by Anglo-American bombing raids, the part Romanesque, part Gothic, very large ''Eglise Saint-Thomas'' with its [[Gottfried Silbermann|Silbermann]] [http://perso.wanadoo.fr/eisenberg/orgues/stthomas.htm organ] on which W. A. Mozart and Albert Schweitzer played, the Gothic ''Eglise Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant'' with its crypt dating back to the 5th century, the Gothic ''Eglise Saint-Guillaume'' with its fine early-Renaissance stained glass and furniture, the Gothic ''Eglise Saint-Jean'' etc.
The [[Neo-gothic architecture|Neo-Gothic]] church ''Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Catholique'' (there is also an adjacent church ''Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Protestant'') serves as a shrine for several 15th-century woodworked and painted [[Altar#Altars in Christian churches|altars]] coming from other, now destroyed churches and installed there for public display.
Among the numerous secular medieval buildings, the monumental Ancienne Douane (old custom-house) stands out.
[[Image:Kammerzell-Haus-Strassbourg.jpg|thumb|120 px|right|[[Maison Kammerzell]]]]
The German [[Renaissance]] has bequeathed the city some noteworthy buildings (especially the current ''Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie'', former town hall, on ''Place Gutenberg''), as did the French [[Baroque]] and [[Classicism]] with several palaces, among which the ''Palais Rohan'' (now housing three museums) is the most spectacular. Others are the ''Hôtel du Préfet'', the ''Hôtel des Deux-Ponts'' and the city-hall ''Hôtel de Ville'' (''hôtel particulier'' meaning palace) etc. The largest baroque building of Strasbourg though is the 1720s main building of the ''Hôpital civil''.
As for French [[Neo-classicism]], it is the Opera house on Place Broglie that most prestigiously represents this style. 

[[Image:Strasbourg petitefrance2.jpg|thumb|130 px|right|''[[Petite-France|Petite France]]'']]

[[Image:Strasbourg-Palais du Rhin.jpg|thumb|130 px|right|''[[Palais du Rhin]]'']]
[[Image:Strasbourg-TNS.jpg|130px|thumb|right|The ''Théâtre national de Strasbourg'', former regional parliament (''Landtag''), another typically large and heavy Wilhelmian building]]
[[Image:Musee alsacien Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|130 px|The ''Musée Alsacien'', consisting of three adjacent old buildings with their respective courtyards and rear aisles. The entrance is seen on the far right]]

Strasbourg also offers high-class [[Eclecticism in art|eclecticist]] buildings in its very extended German district (''Place de la République'', ''Place de l'Université'', ''Place Brant'', ''Place Arnold''), being the main memory of [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelmian architecture]] since most of the major cities in Germany proper suffered intensive damages during World War II. Streets, boulevards and avenues like ''Avenue de la Forêt Noire'', ''Avenue des Vosges'', ''Avenue d'Alsace'', ''Avenue de la Marseillaise'', ''Avenue de la Liberté'', ''Boulevard de la Victoire'', ''Rue Sellénick'', ''Rue du Général de Castelnau'', ''Rue du Maréchal Foch'' and ''Rue du Maréchal Joffre'' are homogenous, surprisingly high (up to seven stores) and broad examples of German urban lay-out and of this architectural style that summons and mixes up five centuries of European architecture as well as Neo-Egyptian, Neo-Greek and Neo-Babylonian styles. The former imperial palace ''[[Palais du Rhin]]'', the most political and thus heavily criticised of all German Strasbourg buildings epitomises the grand scale and stylistical sturdiness of this period. But the two most handsome and ornate buildings of these times are the ''École internationale des Pontonniers'' (the former ''Jungmädchenschule'', young girls school) with its towers, turrets and multiple round and square angles and the ''École des Arts décoratifs'' with its lavishly ornate facade of painted bricks, woodwork and [[majolica]].

Impressive examples of Prussian military architecture of the 1880s can be found along the newly (re)opened ''Rue du Rempart'', displaying large scale fortifications among which the aptly named ''Kriegstor'' (war gate).

As for modern and contemporary architecture, Strasbourg possesses some fine [[Art Nouveau]] buildings (the huge ''Palais des Fêtes'', some houses and villas on ''Avenue de la Robertsau'' and ''Rue Sleidan''), good examples of post-[[World War II]] functional architecture (the ''Cité Rotterdam'', for which [[Le Corbusier]] did not succeed in the architectural contest) and, in the very extended ''Quartier Européen'', some spectacular administrative buildings of sometimes utterly large size, among which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] by [[Richard Rogers]] is arguably the finest. Other noticeable contemporary buildings are the new [[Music school]] ''Cité de la Musique et de la Danse'', the ''[[Musée d'art moderne et contemporain of Strasbourg|Musée d'Art moderne et contemporain]]'' and the ''Hôtel du Département'' facing it, as well as, in the outskirts, the tramway-station [[Hoenheim]]-Nord designed by [[Zaha Hadid]].

Finally, the city is also home to some beautiful bridges, among which the medieval ''Ponts Couverts'' with its four towers is the most spectacular. 

Next to it is a part of the 17th-century [[Vauban]] fortifications, the ''[[Barrage Vauban]]''. Other nice bridges are the ornate 19th-century [http://www.visiter-strasbourg.com/Liste_Totale/pont_fonderie.htm ''Pont de la Fonderie''] (stone) and [http://www.visiter-strasbourg.com/Liste_Totale/pont_auvergne.htm ''Pont d'Auvergne''] (iron), as well as the futuristic ''Passerelle'' over the Rhine, opened in 2004.

===Parks===
Strasbourg also features a number of prominent [[park]]s, of which several are of cultural and historical interest: the ''Parc de l'Orangerie'', created for [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] and displaying noteworthy French gardens, a neo-classical castle and a small [[zoo]]; the ''Parc de la Citadelle'', built around impressive remains of the 17th-century [[fortress]] erected close to the [[Rhine]] by [[Vauban]]; the ''Parc de Pourtalès'', laid out in English style around a [[Neo-baroque]] castle that now houses the [[Schiller International University]], and featuring an open-air museum of contemporary sculpture (works by [[Barry Flanagan]], [[Ernest Pignon-Ernest]], [[Claudio Parmiggiani]], [[Stephan Balkenhol]]...). 
The ''Jardin Botanique'' (botanical garden) was created under the German administration next to the [[Observatory of Strasbourg]], built in [[1881]], and still owns some [[greenhouse]]s of those times. The ''Parc des Contades'', although the oldest park of the city, was completely remodeled after World War II. The futuristic ''Parc des Poteries'' is an example of European park-conception in the late 1990s. The ''Jardin des deux Rives'', spread over Strasbourg and [[Kehl]] on both sides of the Rhine, is the most recent ([[2004]]) and most extended (60 [[hectare]]) park of the agglomeration.

===Museums===

For a city of comparatively small size, Strasbourg displays a large quantity and variety of museums : 
#The ''Musée des Beaux-Arts'' owns paintings by [[Hans Memling]], [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Giotto di Bondone]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[El Greco]], [[Correggio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] and [[Piero di Cosimo]], among others.

Today, the [[aire urbaine|metropolitan area]] of Strasbourg reaches 650,000 inhabitants and the [[eurodistrict]] 868,000 inhabitants [http://www.eurodistrict.eu/fr/index.php?page=donnees&menu=menu5].

==Culture==

Strasbourg is the seat of some internationally reputed institutions in the musical and dramatic domain :
*The [[Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg]]
*The [[Opéra national du Rhin]]
*The [[Théâtre national de Strasbourg]]
*The [[Percussions de Strasbourg]]
*The [[Théâtre du Maillon]]
*The "[[Laiterie]]"
*[[Musica (Festival)|Musica]], international festival of contemporary [[classical music]] (autumn)
*[[Festival international de Strasbourg]], large festival of classical music and [[jazz]] (summer)
*[[Festival des Artefacts]], festival of contemporary non-classical music
*[[Les Nuits de l'Ososphère]] 

Other theatres are the ''Théâtre jeune public'', the ''TAPS Scala'', the ''Kafteur''...

==Education==

Strasbourg, which was a [[humanism]] centre, has a long history of higher-education excellence, melting French and German intellectual traditions. Although Strasbourg had been annexed by Royal France in 1683, it still remained connected to the German-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century and the university attracted numerous students from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with  [[Goethe]], [[Metternich]] and [[Maximilian von Montgelas|Montgelas]], who studied law in Strasbourg, among the most prominent. Nowadays, Strasbourg is known to offer among the best university courses in France, after Paris.

There are three [[University of Strasbourg|universities in Strasbourg]]:

* Strasbourg I - [[Université Louis Pasteur]]
* Strasbourg II - [[Université Marc Bloch]]
* Strasbourg III - [[Université Robert Schuman]]

The campus of the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA) is located in Strasbourg (the former one being in [[Paris]]). The location of the "new" ENA - which trains most of the nation's high-ranking civil servants - was meant to give a European vocation to the school.

The [[École supérieure des Arts décoratifs]] (ESAD) is an art school of Europe-wide reputation. 

The permanent campus of the [[International Space University]] (ISU) is located in the south of Strasbourg ([[Illkirch-Graffenstaden]]).

==Transport Systems==

A modern-looking [[tram]] system has operated in Strasbourg since [[1994]] by the regional transit company [[Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois]]. A former tram system, partly following a different route, had been operation since [[1878]] but was ultimately dismantled in [[1960]].

Two [[TGV]] lines are planned to link Strasbourg to the European high-speed train network:
# [[LGV Est|TGV ''Est'']] ([[Paris]]-Strasbourg) (under construction, to open [[2007]])
# [[LGV Rhin-Rhône|TGV ''Rhin-Rhône'']] (Strasbourg-[[Lyon]]) (to open [[2011]])

== European role ==

[[Image:European Court of Human Rights.jpg|150 px|thumb|right|The [[European Court of Human Rights]]]]
Strasbourg is: 
*the seat of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (informally known as the "Strasbourg Court"); and
*the first seat of the [[European Parliament]] and the only place where the whole parliament regularly meets. (MEPs mostly work in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], where the other two main institutions of the EU are headquartered.) 
*the seat of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]
*the seat of the [[CLRAE|Congress of the Council of Europe]] (located at the [[Palais de l'Europe]]). 
*the seat of the [[European Ombudsman]]

Strasbourg also houses the [[Eurocorps]] headquarters as well as the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] ([http://www.pheur.org/site/page_628.php]) and the Franco-German television channel, [[Arte]].

France and Germany are creating a [[Eurodistrict]] straddling the Rhine, combining the Greater Strasbourg and the [[Ortenaukreis|Ortenau]] district of [[Baden-Württemberg]], with some common administration. The combined population of this district is 868,000 [http://www.eurodistrict.eu/fr/index.php?page=donnees&menu=menu5].
