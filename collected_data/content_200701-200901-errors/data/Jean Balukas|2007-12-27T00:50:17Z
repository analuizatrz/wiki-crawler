'''Jean Balukas''' (b. [[June 28]] [[1959]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Pocket billiards|pool]] player from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], and ranks among the stellar players in the history of the sport. At least through the 1990s, when [[Allison Fisher]] began her ascendancy, Balukas was widely acknowledged as the sole candidate for greatest female player ever.<ref>{{cite book | author= Steve Mizerak and Michael E.

From a very young start, Balukas completely dominated women's professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s. Balukas won the U.S. Open [[straight pool]] championship seven years in a row from 1972 through 1978, accumulating six world championship titles, has well over 100 professional competition first place finishes with 38 majors to her name, had a streak of 16 first place finishes in women's professional tournaments, and was the only woman to compete on equal footing with men in professional play in her era.<ref name="NYT6" /><ref name="BCA">Billiard Congress America (1995-2005).

==Young prodigy==
Jean's father, Albert Balukas, along with his partner, professional player [[Frank McGown]], was the proprietor of a forty-eight-table [[pool hall]] called the Ovington Lounge in the [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] section of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Balukas's introduction to play was at 4 years of age, not on one of her father's tables but on a 4-1&frasl;2&nbsp;by&nbsp;9&nbsp;foot [[Billiards table|pool table]] in the cellar of her childhood home, purchased by her parents to keep her four billiards-playing brothers out of local pool rooms.<ref name="NYT4">The New York Times Company ([[October 18]] [[1987]]).

Wielding an ivory-detailed [[Cue stick|cue]] made especially for her in 1965 by renowned cuemaker [[George Balabushka]], at 5 and 6 years of age she would practice [[straight pool]] to 50 points after family dinners with her father's encouragement but not participation.<ref name="NYT1" /><ref name="NYT2" /> Many have assumed that she had been tutored in the game. However, Balukas states, "when they find out that my father doesn't play, many people think I must have learned the game from Frank McGown. That isn't true. I taught myself to play pool."<ref name="NYT4" />

In 1966, McGown was staging a billiards [[Exhibition match|exhibition]] at New York City's [[Grand Central Station]]. With her parents' permission, he brought along the 6-year-old Balukas, where she participated in the spectacle. The attention this generated, coupled with her prodigious talent, landed her a guest appearance in 1966 on [[WNEW-TV]]'s ''[[Wonderama]]''. Later that year, Balukas, along with her younger sister Laura, appeared on [[CBS]]'s popular show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. None of the panelists were successful in guessing that the 7- and 5-year-old sisters were pool enthusiasts.<ref name="NYT1" /><ref name="NYT2" />

The following year Balukas appeared an exhibition match at the bygone Carom Club, then located at 1697 Broadway in Manhattan. A [[Second grade|second-grader]] at the time, according to her mother, Peggy, she did her homework and took a nap before appearing at the scheduled match.<ref name="NYT1" /> Billed as "the Little Princess of Pocket Billiards", and described by a reporter at the match as "a little girl with honey-blond hair...wearing a short yellow dress and green leotards," to great applause she edged out her opponent, Roland DeMarco, a pool enthusiast and President of [[Finch College]], with a final score of 50–42.<ref name="NYT1" />

==U.S. Open Straight Pool Champion==
On [[August 18]], [[1972]] at 13 years of age Balukas won the women's division of the [[U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship]], taking home a prize of [[United States dollar|US$]]1,500 and the achievement of being its youngest winner ever.

Balukas was not just talented at pool but was an all-around good athlete. Starting at age 16, and for two other years, she was invited to participate in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[Superstars#United States|Superstars]]'', which pitted championship athletes from one sport competing in sports other than their own specialties. In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, she finished second and was awarded prize money. The win was bittersweet for Balukas, because she lost [[amateur]] standing and was thereafter banned from competing in high school sports, also becoming no longer eligible for a college athletic scholarship.<Ref name="NYT4" />

==Playing with men==
As early as the late 1960s, Balukas was performing exhibition matches with some of the top male players, including  [[Willie Mosconi]] and [[Irving Crane]], who were together considered the "best in the world, flat out" between 1941 and 1956.<ref name="BD" /> In 1975, she played the legendary [[Willie Mosconi]] on the CBS "Challenge of the Sexes", defeating him in both [[eight-ball]] and [[nine-ball]] competition.  By 1983, because of her stellar track record, Balukas was nominated 1983 Player of the Year as well as Commissioner of the Lucky Strike Filters California State Eight-ball Championship.<ref>''National Tavern News'' (March 1984), p. 5. "Lucky Strike Filters California State Eight-ball Championship." Retrieved May 18, 2007.</ref>

According to a 1987 interview with reporter Roger Starr of ''The New York Times,'' she learned much about pool through such activities but "she also learned that, even in fun, pool stars did not like losing in public, especially not to children, and less, even, to girl children. She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls. She recalls, 'Whenever my brother Paul, the youngest of my four brothers, beat me at pool on the table downstairs at home, he would run through the house shouting 'I won, I beat her'. I guess that was one reason I worked all the harder at my game.'" <ref name="NYT4" /> 

On [[August 6]] [[1978]] Balukas became the first woman to qualify to play in the men's division of the World Open Pocket Billiards Championship; a tournament with an 100-year history. This meant that she would be competing in both the women's and men's divisions of the tournament to be held on August 12th of that year at the [[Biltmore Hotel]] located at 43rd Street and [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]] in New York City.<ref>The New York Times Company ([[August 6]] [[1978]]).

Balukas played against the men in a number of competitions, including at least one televised match aired on [[March 25]] [[1979]], between her and men's champion [[Ray Martin (pool player)|Ray Martin]]. The match was billed on the television schedule as part of a "Challenge of the Sexes," alongside similar male-female matchups between golfers [[Nancy Lopez]] and [[Andy North]] and coed participants in a skateboarding challenge match.<ref>The New York Times Company  ([[March 25]] [[1979]]).

She also competed in the women's division of that tournament and was the victor, defeating [[Billie Billings]], also of Brooklyn, with a score of 100–75. According to ''The New York Times'', "Miss Balukas's triumph...was not only expected but routine.

Balukas was initially entered in both the men's and women's divisions of the 1987 B.C. Classic, a [[nine-ball]] competition.  After notable controversy (detailed below), she competed only on the men's side. Along the way she trounced [[Keith McCready]] 11–3 (at the time the 17th-ranked male player by money list, and who guest-starred as obnoxious hustler "Grady Seasons" in the 1986 film ''[[The Color of Money]]''). Balukas finished in a tie for 9th place among many of the best players in the world.

==Dress code controversy==
In August 1987, at the annual B.C. Classic hosted at a [[Holiday Inn]] in [[Binghamton, New York]], Balukas was slated for competition in both divisions. After arriving, she discovered that for evening-scheduled matches she would be required to wear [[Formal wear|formal attire]] that she did not have with her. The men's division, by contrast, had no similar [[dress code]]. Balukas took a stand that the women should not be treated differently than the men, and accordingly refused to procure garments that would meet the unequal mandate.<ref name="NYT4" /> 

The women held a vote as to whether Balukas should be allowed to play. She later explained that "what hurt at Binghamton was that while I was trying to stand up for us being treated the same as men, the other girls held the tournament draw without me. By one vote, they kept me out. And some of the girls who are my best friends voted against me."<ref name="NYT4" /> 

She did not agree at the time with the speculation of others that her professional rivals had their own self-interest at heart, knowing that with her out of the competition they would have a much better chance at the $5,000 first place prize award. Despite the women's [[Wikt:snub|snub]] and perceived [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]] terms, she nevertheless competed on the men's side, tying for ninth place.<ref name="NYT4" /> Not long afterward, she indicated to a reporter that she was "thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether."<ref name="NYT4" /> 

Soon after the dress code dust-up made headlines, a letter was sent to ''The New York Times'' by the [[Women's Professional Billiard Association]] (WPBA), by its president [[Belinda Bearden]], disputing the facts as reported. According to the WPBA, the dress code was self-imposed by the players in an attempt to improve the image of women's pool and to attract more spectators and press to the sport, and that Balukas was the only participant at Binghamton unwilling to comply. They further explained that Balukas first withdrew from the women's division but later returned and asked to play after player assignments had been completed. A vote to allow her to play resulted in a tally of 8-7 in her favor, but after they moved to consult a player who was not present for the vote, Balukas again withdrew from the competition, and that was where the matter had ended.<ref>The New York Times Company  ([[November 27]] [[1987]]).

==Break with the sport==
In 1988, Balukas was playing against professional [[Robin Bell (pool player)|Robin Bell]] in a televised match of the [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick]]-sponsored [[World Open Nine-ball Championship]] held at [[Caesar's Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Bell, who was Balukas' best friend on the women's tour, had never beaten Balukas but had been playing very strongly in the tournament. With the score 2 games to 3 in favor of Bell in a {{Cuegloss|Race|race to nine games}}, Bell made the 9 ball {{Cuegloss|On the snap|on the snap}} two games in a row, making the score 5 to 2 in very short order.<ref name="NYW" /><ref name="NYT6" />

All television match players wore small microphones so that their words and the sounds of play could be heard by the audience. After Bell's second 9 ball break, Balukas reportedly muttered within the range of the microphone words to the effect the Bell was having "a string of inordinately lucky shots." She was cautioned by the referee and play continued, with Balukas the ultimate victor with a final score of 9–5.<ref name="BD" /><ref name="NYW" /><ref name="NYT6" />

According to an interview with Balukas appearing in ''New York Woman'' magazine in 1991, Balukas's exact words were "Some world championship" and "Beat me with skill, not luck." Despite their off-the-table friendship, following the match Bell made a formal complaint to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors thereafter sanctioned Balukas $200 for [[Sportsmanship|unsportsmanlike conduct]].<ref name="NYW" /><ref name="NYT6" />

Balukas was greatly incensed over the sanction and refused to pay on principle, turning away offers by others to pay the fine in her stead. Balukas explains that "It wasn’t the $200... &#91;Women&#93; pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, were the ones who decided I should be fined. I felt it should have been done by an outside panel, not by my competitors."<ref name="NYW" /><ref name="NYT6" />

The sides were at an impasse. Balukas refused to relent and the WPBA refused to lift the sanction and would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid the fine. "Just because she was our premier player doesn't mean she was above the rules," said [[Vicki Paski]] in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Professional [[Loree Jon Jones]] in the same interview expressed mixed sentiments: "Her not playing is, I guess, sad," but she reflected that in Balukas's absence, "we've all learned how to win."<ref name="NYT6" />

There were other factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, much of it self-imposed. After she reached the pinnacle of her profession, "That’s when I started getting nervous...  that’s when I started putting a lot of pressure on myself." <ref name="NYW" /> "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but &#91;losing&#93; hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time."<ref name="NYW" />

Balukas had also felt some heat from her solo venture into the men's arena. She had heard taunts from the men upon finding out she was going to play in their division, such as "I’m gonna put on a dress and go play with the women."<ref name="NYW" /> In early 1988, Balukas gave in to complaints from the men upon her entry to a Chicago based tournament that it wasn't fair she should have the opportunity to play in both divisions when the men only had the opportunity to play in one, and withdrew from the men's side.<ref name="NYW" /> Balukas states that after she arrived in Chicago "I found out that the first- and second-place winners in the women’s event were going to be invited to play in the men’s event. I was stabbed in the back."<ref name="NYW" />

Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to a point where I had so much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break."<ref name="NYW" />
 
For Balukas's part, she returned to Bay Ridge, took over management of her family's pool hall, Hall of Fame Billiards on Ovington Avenue in Brooklyn, and states that "I'm enjoying my life immensely...I have moved on."<ref name="NYT6" /> In summing up these events in a 1992 article, ''The New York Times'' stated, "So America's greatest woman pool player competes only for the odd soda.

By 1987, Balukas's dominance of women's professional pool was so complete that it was described as "breathtaking" in its scope by ''The New York Times''.<ref name="NYT6">The New York Times Company ([[August 22]] [[1992]]). [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F10611FF3E5D0C718EDDA10894DA494D81 Billiard Master Reposes in Self-Exile] by Douglas Martin. Retrieved May 6, 2007.</ref> Announcers had long since stopped calling Balukas "the Little Princess," but presented her as "the Queen".<ref name="NYW" /><ref name="NYT4" />

By that time she had won the World Straight Pool Championship women's division eight of the prior nine years, and over the same time period, ''every single'' women's professional tournament in which she competed — 16 in all.<ref name="NYW" /><ref name="NYT4" /> 

She had been honored as BCA Player of the Year five times.<ref name="BCA" /> and in 1985 became the second woman (after [[Dorothy Wise]]) to be inducted into the BCA Hall of Fame, with the additional honor of being its youngest inductee, at just under 27 years of age.<ref name="BCA" /> In 1999, Balukas was ranked number fifteen on ''Billiard Digest's'' Fifty Greatest Players of the Century.<ref name="BD" />
