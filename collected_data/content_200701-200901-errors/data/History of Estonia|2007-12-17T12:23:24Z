[[Estonia]] was settled immediately after the [[Ice Age]], beginning from around [[8500 BC]]. After the [[Northern Crusades]], being conquered by Danes and Germans in 1227, Estonia was ruled initially by [[Denmark]] in the north and by [[Livonian order]] in the South. 1943-1562 the whole Estonia was a part of [[Livonian Confederation]]. Estonia became a part of Kingdom of [[Sweden]] from the 16th century to 1721, when it was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]]. Throughout this period the [[Baltic German]] nobility enjoyed autonomy, where the language of administration and education was German. The [[Estophilia#Estophile_Enlightenment_Period | Estophile Enlightenment Period ]]in 1750-1840 led to the [[Estonian national awakening]] in the middle of the 19th century. In 1918 the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] was issued. The [[Estonian War of Independence]] ensued on two fronts between the newly proclaimed state and [[Bolshevist Russia]] to the east and the forces of the [[United Baltic Duchy]], [[Baltische Landeswehr]] to the south, resulting in the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Tartu Peace Treaty]] recognising Estonian independence in perpetuity. Prior to the [[Second World War]], Estonia was occupied and according to the USA, <ref name="USA">[http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/86539.htm U.S.-Baltic Relations: Celebrating 85 Years of Friendship] at state.gov </ref> the EU,<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+MOTION+B6-2007-0215+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN Motion for a resolution on the Situation in Estonia] by [[EU]]</ref> [[European Court of Human Rights]] <ref>[[European Court of Human Rights cases on Occupation of Baltic States]]</ref> illegally annexed by the Soviet Union as a result of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. During the war Estonia was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]], then reoccupied by the Soviet Union in 1944. Estonia regained independence in 1991 after the collapse of the USSR and joined the [[European Union]] in 2004. 

==Pre-history==
{{main|Ancient Estonia}}
===The Mesolithic Period===
[[Image:KundaCultureTools.jpg|thumb|Tools made by Kunda Culture, the Estonian History Museum]]
The region has been populated since the end of the last glacial era, about 10.000 B.C. The earliest traces of human settlement in Estonia are connected with [[Kunda culture]]. The Early [[Mesolithic]] [[Pulli settlement]] is located by the [[Pärnu]] River. It has been dated to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC. The Kunda Culture received its name from the ''Lammasmäe'' settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kBZlHdp7tdcC&pg Estonia: Identity and Independence, p.24 ISBN 9042008903]</ref> Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in [[Latvia]], northern [[Lithuania]] and southern [[Finland]]. Among minerals [[flint]] and [[quartz]] was used the most for making cutting tools.

===The Neolithic Period===

The beginning of the [[Neolithic period]] is marked by the ceramics of the Narva culture, appear in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium. The oldest finds date from around 4900 B.C. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.
[[Image:CombCeramicPottery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Comb Ceramic Culture|Comb Ceramic]] pottery at the Estonian History Museum]]
Around the beginning of 4th millennium [[Comb Ceramic Culture]] arrived in Estonia. <ref name ="HE">[http://books.google.com/books?id=X2LTAAAACAAJHistory of Estonia ISBN 9985206061]</ref> Until the early 1980s the arrival of [[Finnic peoples]], the ancestors of the Estonians, Finns, Livonians on the shores of Baltic sea around was associated with the Comb Ceramic Culture <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&pg=PA153&ots Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States, p153 ISBN 0313306109]</ref> However , such a linking of archaeologically defined cultural entities with linguistic ones cannot be proven and it has been suggested that the increase of settlement finds in the period is more likely to have been associated with an economic boom related to the warming of climate. Some researchers have even argued that a Uralic form of language may have been spoken in Estonia  and Finland since the end of the last glaciation. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=PFBtfXG6fXAC&pg The Cambridge History of Scandinavia, p.51 ISBN 0521472997] </ref>
[[Image:CordWareBoatAxe.jpg|thumb|[[Corded Ware culture]] pottery and stone axes, at the EHM]]
The burial customs of the comb pottery people included additions of figures of animals, birds, snakes and men carved from bone and [[amber]]. Antiquities from comb pottery culture are found from Northern Finland to Eastern Prussia.

The beginning of the Late Neolithic Period about 2200 B.C. is characterized by the appearance of the [[Corded Ware culture]], pottery with corded decoration and well-polished stone axes (s.c. boat-shape axes). Evidence of agriculture is provided by charred grain of wheat on the wall of a corded-ware vessel found in Iru settlement. Osteological analysis show an attempt was made to domesticate the wild boar. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kBZlHdp7tdcC&pg Estonia: Identity and Independence, p.29 ISBN 9042008903]</ref>

Specific burial customs were characterized the dead laid on their sides with their knees pressed against their breast, one hand under the head. Objects placed into the graves were mad of bones of domesticated animals.<ref name ="HE"/>

===The Bronze Age===
[[Image:StoneCistGraves.jpg|thumb|Stone Cist Graves from The Bronze Age in Northern Estonia]]

The beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in Estonia is dated to approximately 1800 B.C. The development of the borders between the [[Finnic peoples]] and the [[Balts]] was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of [[Saaremaa]] and Iru in the Northern Estonia began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, stone cist graves and cremation burials became increasingly common aside small number of boat-shaped stone graves. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kBZlHdp7tdcC&pg Estonia: Identity and Independence, p.26 ISBN 9042008903]</ref>

===The Iron Age===

The [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] began in Estonia about 500 B.C. and lasted until the middle of the 1.st century A.D. The oldest iron items were imported, although since the first century iron was smelted from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square [[Celtic fields]] surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of social stratification.

The [[Roman Iron Age]] in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 A.D., the era that was affected by the influence of the [[Roman Empire]]. In material culture this is reflected by few Roman coins, some [[jewellery]] and artefacts. The abundance of iron artefacts in Southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas: Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia, and Western Estonia including the islands had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kBZlHdp7tdcC&pg Estonia: Identity and Independence, p.28-31 ISBN 9042008903]</ref>

===Early Middle Ages===
[[Image:Europe 814.jpg|thumb|200px|Europe in 9th century]]

The name of Estonia occurs first in a form of [[Aestii]] in the [[1st century]] AD by [[Tacitus]], however, it might have indicated Baltic tribes living in the area. In Northern Sagas (9th century) the term started to be used to indicate the Estonians. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Cp-tB08yd2EC&pg=PA21&ots=iOJ4ee16Aq&dq The Uralic Language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics., p21-23 ISBN 0631231706] </ref>

[[Ptolemy]] in his ''Geography III'' in the middle of the [[2nd century]] CE mentions the [[Osilians]] among other dwellers on the Baltic shore. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=4BxvGd3c9OYC&pg  A History of Pagan Europe By Prudence Jones, Nigel Pennick; p.195] ISBN 0415091365</ref>

According to the fifth-century Roman historian [[Cassiodorus]] the people known to Tacitius as the Aestii were the Estonians. The extent of their territory in early medieval times is disputed but the nature of their religion is not. They were known to the Scandinavians as experts in wind-magic, as were the Lapps (known at the time as Finns) in the North. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=4BxvGd3c9OYC&dq A History of Pagan Europe. p179 ISBN 0415091365] </ref> Cassiodorus mentions Estonia in his book V. Letters 1-2 dating from the [[6th century]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ctLVS8l-O-4C&pg=PA265&dq=Cassiodorus+Esthonia The Letters of Cassiodorus Translated by Thomas

The [[Chudes]] as mentioned by a monk Nestor in the earliest Russian chronicles, were the Ests or Esthonians <ref name="PPFP141"> [http://books.google.com/books?id=q5gCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA141 Pre- and Proto-historic Finns by John Abercromby p.141] </ref>.

[[Image:VarbolaByMellin.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Map of [[Varbola Stronghold]] by L. A. Mellin]]
In the first centuries CE political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (kihelkond) and the county (maakond). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: [[Saare County|Saaremaa]] (Osilia), [[Läänemaa]] (Rotalia or Maritima), [[Harjumaa]] (Harria), [[Rävala]] (Revalia), [[Virumaa]] (Vironia), [[Järvamaa]] (Jervia), [[Sakala]] (Saccala), and [[Ugandi]] (Ugaunia).<ref> Estonia and the Estonians (Studies of Nationalities) Toivo U. Raun p.11 ISBN 0817928529</ref>

[[Varbola Stronghold]] was one of the largest circular rampart fortress and trading center built in [[Estonia]], [[Harju County]] ([[Latin]]:''Harria'') at the time.

In the 11th century the Scandinavians are frequently chronicled as combating the [[Vikings]] from the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. 
With the rise of [[Christianity]], centralized authority in Scandinavia and Germany eventually lead to [[Baltic crusades]].
The east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest: First the [[Livs]], [[Letts]] and [[Estonians]], then the [[Prussians]] and the [[Finns]] underwent defeat, [[baptism]], [[military occupation]] and sometimes extermination by groups of Germans, Danes and Swedes.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; p.93; ISBN 0140266534</ref>

{{main|Estonian Crusade}}

Estonia remained one of the last corners of medieval Europe to be [[Christianity|Christianized]]. In 1193 [[Pope Celestine III]] called for a crusade against [[paganism|pagan]]s in [[Northern Europe]]. [[Northern Crusades]] from Northern [[Germany]] established the stronghold of [[Riga]] (in modern Latvia). With the help of the newly converted local tribes of [[Livonian people|Livs]] and [[Latvians|Letts]], the crusaders initiated raids into part of what is present-day Estonia in 1208. Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally themselves sacked territories controlled by the crusaders. In 1217 the German crusading order the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Sword Brethren]] and their recently converted allies, won a major battle in which the Estonian commander [[Lembitu of Lehola|Lembitu]] was killed.  The period of the several Northern Crusade battles in Estonia between [[1208]] and [[1227]] is also known as the period of Estonian ancient fight for independence. 

===Danish Estonia===
{{main|Danish Estonia}}

[[Image:Confederation of Livonia 1260.svg|left|150px|thumb|[[Livonia]] in [[1260]].]]
Northern Estonia was conquered by [[Denmark|Danish]] crusaders led by king [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Waldemar II]], who arrived in [[1219]] on the site of in an Estonian town of Lindanisse <ref>{{dk icon}}[http://runeberg.org/img/salmonsen/2/7/0518.pdf] SALMONSENS
KONVERSATIONS
LEKSIKON</ref> (Now [[Tallinn]]) at (Latin) ''Revelia'' (Estonian) ''Revala'' or ''[[Rävala]]'', the adjacent ancient Estonian county. The Danish Army defeated the Estonians at [[Battle of Lyndanisse]]. 

Estonians of [[Harria]] started a rebellion in [[1343]] ([[St.George's Night Uprising]]). The province was occupied by the [[Livonian Order]] as a result. In [[1346]], the Danish dominions in Estonia ([[Harria]] and [[Vironia]]) were sold for 10&nbsp;000 [[mark (weight)|marks]] to the [[Livonian Order]].

===Swedish coastal settlements===
The first written mention of the [[Estonian Swedes]] comes from [[1294]], in the laws of the town of [[Haapsalu]]. Estonian Swedes are one of the earliest known minorities in Estonia. They have also been called ''Coastal Swedes'' (''"Rannarootslased"'' in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]), or according to their settlement area [[Ruhnu]] Swedes, Hiiu Swedes etc. They themselves used the poetic expression ''aibofolke'' — ''Island People''.

The ancient areas of Swedish settlement in Estonia were Ruhnu Island, [[Hiiumaa]] Island, the west coast and smaller islands ([[Vormsi]], [[Noarootsi]], Sutlepa, Riguldi, [[Osmussaar]]), the north-west coast of the Harju District (Nõva, Vihterpalu, Kurkse, the Pakri Peninsula and the Pakri Islands) and [[Naissaar]] Island near Tallinn. The towns with a significant percentage of Swedish population have been [[Haapsalu]] and Tallinn.

In earlier times Swedes have also lived on the coasts of Saaremaa, the southern part of [[Läänemaa]], the eastern part of [[Harjumaa]] and the western part of [[Virumaa]].

===Livonian Confederation===

Estonia in [[Livonian Confederation]] from 1228 to the 1560s.

In 1227 the Sword Brethren conquered the last indigenous stronghold in the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]]. After the conquest, all remaining local pagans of Estonia were ostensibly [[Christianity|Christianized]]. 
[[Image:Livland 15jh.png|thumb|right|150px|Livonian Confederation in the [[15th century]]]]
The territory was then divided between the [[Livonian Order|Livonian branch]] of the [[Teutonic Order]], the [[Bishopric of Dorpat]] (in Estonian: ''Tartu piiskopkond'') and the [[Bishopric of Oesel-Wiek]] (in Estonian: ''Saare-Lääne piiskopkond''). The Northern part of Estonia - more exactly Harjumaa and Virumaa districts (in German: Harrien und Wierland) - was a nominal possession of [[Denmark]] until 1346. [[Tallinn]] (Reval) was given the [[Lübeck law|Lübeck Rights]] in 1248 and joined the [[Hanseatic League]] at the end of the 13th century. In [[1343]] the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa (Oesel) Island started a rebellion ([[St. George's Night Uprising]]) against the rule of their German-speaking landlords. The uprising was put down, and [[Vesse]], the rebel King of Saaremaa, was hanged in 1344. 

Despite local rebellions and [[Muscovy|Muscovian]] invasions in 1481 and 1558, the local [[Low German]]-speaking [[Baltic Germans|upper class]] continued to rule Estonia and from 1524 preserved Estonian commitment to the [[Protestant Reformation]].

==The Reformation Period==

The Reformation in  Europe began in 1517 with Martin Luther (1483-1546) and his 95 Theses. 

The Reformation resulted in great change in the Baltic.  Ideas entered the Livonian Confederation very quickly and by the 1520’s they were well known.  Language, education, religion, and politics were greatly transformed.  The Church services were now given in the local vernacular, instead of Latin, as was previously used. <ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/reform.html Protestant Reformation in the Baltic] at University of Washington</ref>

===Division of Estonia in Livonian War===
{{main|Livonian War}}

During the [[Livonian War]] in 1561, northern Estonia submitted to Swedish control, while southern Estonia briefly came under the control of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 1580s. In 1625, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule. Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of [[Swedish Estonia|Estonia]] in the north and [[Livonia]] in southern Estonia and northern Latvia, a division which persisted until the early [[20th century|twentieth century]].

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{main|Duchy of Livonia}}
[[Image:Rzeczpospolita2nar.png|thumb|left|left|150x|Outline of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
[[Image:sweden2.gif|thumb|right|120px|Formation of the Swedish Empire, 1560-1660]]
during 1582–83 southern Estonia ([[Livonia]]) became part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

===Estonia in Swedish Empire===

{{main|Swedish Estonia}}
[[Swedish Estonia|Estonia]] placed itself under Swedish rule in [[1561]] to receive protection against [[Muscovy|Russia]] and [[Poland]] as the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Order]] lost their foothold in the Baltic provinces. Territorially it represented the northern part of present day Estonia.

[[Swedish Livonia|Livonia]] was conquered from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] by [[1629]] in the [[Polish-Swedish War (1625–1629)|Polish-Swedish War]]. By the [[Treaty of Oliva]] between the Commonwealth and Sweden in [[1660]] following the [[Northern Wars]] the [[House of Vasa|Polish-Lithuanian king]] renounced all claims to the Swedish throne and Livonia was formally ceded to Sweden. Swedish Livonia represents the southern part of present-day Estonia and the northern part of present-day [[Latvia]] ([[Vidzeme]] region)

In 1631, [[Gustavus Adolphus|Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden]] forced the [[nobility]] to grant the peasantry greater [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]], and in 1632 established a [[printing press]] and [[University of Tartu|University]] in the city of [[Tartu]].

==Estonia in Russian Empire==

[[Image:Europa1899.JPG|150px|thumb|Europa in 19th century]]

Sweden's defeat by Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] in 1721 resulted in the [[Treaty of Nystad]], and Russian rule was then imposed on what later became modern Estonia. Nonetheless, the legal system, [[Lutheran]] church, local and town governments, and education remained mostly German until the late 19th century and partially until 1918.

By 1819, the [[Baltic provinces]] were the first in the Russian empire in which serfdom was abolished, the largely autonomous nobility allowing the peasants to own their own land or move to the cities. These moves created the economic foundation for the coming to life of the local national identity and culture as Estonia was caught in a current of national awakening that began sweeping through Europe in the mid-1800s.

===Age of Enlightenment===
{{main|Estophilia}}

'''Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750-1840)'''<br />
Educated German immigrants and local [[Baltic Germans]] in Estonia, educated at German universities introduced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] of rational thinking, ideas that propagated freedom of thinking and brotherhood and equality. The [[French Revolution]] provided a powerful motive for the enlightened local upper class to create literature for the peasantry. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XKWRct15XfkC&pg=PA313&ots=Qq2c1R9mOc&dq=estophile&sig=Zo0AbiHJL2S843Ipk0WIynoRpso Historical Dictionary of Estonia p. 313 ISBN 0810849046] </ref> The freeing of the peasantry from serfdom on the nobles estates in 1816 in Southern Estonia:[[Governorate of Livonia]] (Russian: Лифляндская губерния) and 1819 in Northern Estonia: [[Governorate of Estonia]] (Russian: Эстляндская губерния) by [[Alexander I of Russia]] gave rise to a debate as to the future fate of the former enslaved peoples. Although Baltic Germans at large regarded the future of Estonians as being a fusion with the Baltic Germans, the Estophile educated class admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13 century. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kBZlHdp7tdcC&pg Estonia:Identity and Independence By Jean-Jacques p.84 ISBN 9042008903 ]</ref> The Estophile Enlightenment Period formed the transition from religious Estonian literature to newspapers written in Estonian for the mass public.

===National Awakening===

{{main|Estonian Age of Awakening}}

A cultural movement sprang forth to adopt the use of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as the language of instruction in schools, all-Estonian song festivals were held regularly after 1869, and a national literature in Estonian developed. "[[Kalevipoeg]]", Estonia's national epic, was published in 1861 in both Estonian and German.

1889 marked the beginning of the central government-sponsored policy of [[Russification]]. The impact of this was that many of the [[Baltic German]] legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian - a good example of this is the [[University of Tartu]].

As the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] swept through Estonia, the Estonians called for [[freedom of the press]] and [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]], for universal [[suffrage|franchise]], and for national autonomy. Estonian gains were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.

===Road to Republic===
{{main|Autonomous Governorate of Estonia}}
[[Image:Estonian_Declaration_of_Independence.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Estonian Declaration of Independence]]]]
Estonia as a unified political entity first emerged after the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917. With the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in [[World War I]], [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Russia's Provisional Government]] granted national autonomy to an [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|unified Estonia]] in April. The [[Reval Governorate|Governorate of Estonia]] in the north (corresponding to the historic [[Danish Estonia]]) was united with the northern part of the [[Riga Governorate|Governorate of Livonia]]. Elections for a provisional parliament,  ''[[Maapäev]]'' was organized, with the [[Menshevik]] and  [[Bolshevik]] fractions of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] obtaining a part of the vote. On [[November 5]], [[1917]], two days before the [[October Revolution]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Estonian [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Jaan Anvelt]] violently usurped power from the legally constituted Maapäev in a coup d'etat, forcing the Maapäev underground.

In February, after the collapse of the peace talks between Soviet Russia and the [[German Empire]], mainland Estonia was occupied by the Germans. Bolshevik forces retreated to Russia. Between the Russian Red Army's retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the [[Salvation Committee]] of the Estonian National Council [[Maapäev]] issued the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]].<ref>[http://www.president.ee/en/estonia Estonian Declaration of Independence 24 February 1918] at www.president.ee</ref> in [[Pärnu]] on [[February 24]], [[1918]] After the collapse of the short-lived puppet government of the [[United Baltic Duchy]] and the withdrawal of German troops in November 1918, an Estonian provisional Government retook office. A military invasion by [[Red Army]] followed a few days later, however, marking the beginning of the [[Estonian War of Independence]] (1918-1920). The Estonian army cleared the entire territory of Estonia of Red Army by February 1919. On 5-7th April 1919 The [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] was elected. On [[February 2]], [[1920]], the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed by the Republic of Estonia and [[Russian SFSR]]. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia. The first [[Constitution of Estonia]] was adopted on [[June 15]] [[1920]]. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.

==Republic of Estonia==<!-- This section is linked from [[Republic of Estonia (1918-1940)]] -->
The first period of independence lasted 22 years, beginning in 1918. Estonia underwent a number of economic, social, and political reforms necessary to come to terms with its new status as a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[state]]. Economically and socially, land reform in 1919 was the most important step. Large estate holdings belonging to the [[Baltic nobility]] were redistributed among the peasants and especially among volunteers in the [[Estonian War of Independence]].  Estonia's principal markets became [[Scandinavia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and western Europe, with some exports to the [[United States]] and to the [[Soviet Union]].

The first constitution of the Republic of Estonia, adopted in 1920, established a [[parliamentary]] form of government.  The parliament (''[[Riigikogu]]'') consisted of 100 members elected for 3-year terms. Between 1921 and 1931, Estonia had 11 governments. 

A mass anticommunist and antiparliamentary [[Vaps Movement]] emerged in the 1930s<ref name="EB">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-623213/Vaps Vaps Movement] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref>
In October [[1933]] [[referendum]] on constitutional reform initiated by the Vaps Movement was approved by 72.7 percent.<ref name="EB"/> The league spearheaded replacement of the [[parliamentary system]] with a [[presidential system|presidential form of government]]  and laid the groundwork for an April 1934  presidential election, which it expected to win. However, the Vaps Movement was thwarted by a pre-emptive [[coup d'état]] on [[March 12]], [[1934]], by [[Head of State of Estonia|Head of State]] [[Konstantin Päts]], who then established his own authoritarian rule until new constitution came to force. During the [[Era of Silence]] political parties were banned and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 as the country was [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]] by [[Konstantin Päts]]. The Vaps Movement  was officially banned and finally disbanded in December 1935. On May 6 [[1936]], 150 members of the league went on trial and 143 of them were convicted to long-term prison sentences. They were granted an amnesty and freed in [[1938]], by which time the league had lost most of its popular support.                 

The independence period was one of great cultural advancement.{{citation}} Estonian language schools were established, and artistic life of all kinds flourished. One of the more notable cultural acts of the independence period, unique in western Europe at the time of its passage in 1925, was a guarantee of cultural autonomy to [[minority group]]s comprising at least 3,000 persons, including [[Jew]]s (see [[history of the Jews in Estonia]]). Historians see the lack of any bloodshed after a nearly "700-year German rule" as indication that it must have been mild by comparison.

Estonia had pursued a policy of neutrality, but it was of no consequence after the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] on [[August 23]], [[1939]] in which the two great powers agreed to divide up the countries situated between them ([[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], Estonia, and [[Finland]]) with Estonia falling in the Soviet "[[sphere of influence]]". After the invasion of Poland, [[Orzeł incident]] took place when Polish submarine [[ORP Orzeł]] looked for shelter in [[Tallinn]] but escaped after [[Soviet Union]] attacked Poland on [[September 17]]. Estonian's lack of will and/or incapability to disarm and intern the crew caused Soviet Union to accuse Estonia of "helping them escape" and claim that Estonia was not neutral. On [[September 24]], [[1939]], the Soviet Union threatened Estonia with war unless provided with military bases in the country –- an ultimatum with which the Estonian government complied.

On [[June 14]], 1940 while world’s attention is focused on the fall of [[Paris]] to [[Nazi Germany]] a day earlier, the Soviet military blockade of Estonia went into effect, two Soviet bombers downed Finnish passenger airplane "[[Kaleva (airplane)|Kaleva]]" flying from Tallinn to Helsinki carrying three diplomatic pouches from the U.S. legations in [[Tallinn]], [[Riga]] and [[Helsinki]]. The US Foreign Service employee [[Henry W. Antheil, Jr.]] was killed in the crash. <ref>[http://www.afsa.org/fsj/may07/lastflight.pdf The Last Flight from Tallinn] at American Foreign Service Association</ref> 

On [[June 16]] 1940, the Soviet Union invaded Estonia. <ref name="TM006241940">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764071-2,00.html Five Years of Dates] at Time magazine on Monday, Jun. 24, 1940 </ref> [[Molotov]] accused the Baltic states of conspiracy against the Soviet Union and delivered an ultimatum to Estonia for the establishment of a government the Soviets approve of.

Smith p.19  ISBN 0415285801</ref> Estonia accepted the ultimatum and the statehood of Estonia [[de facto]] ceased to exist as the Red Army exited from their military bases in Estonia on June 17.

The Soviet authorities, having gained control over Estonia, immediately imposed a regime of terror. During the first year of Soviet occupation (1940-1941) over 8,000 people, including most of the country's leading politicians and military officers, were arrested. About 2,200 of the arrested were executed in Estonia, while most others were moved to prison camps in Russia, from where very few were later able to return alive. On [[June 14]], [[1941]], when mass [[deportation]]s took place simultaneously in all three Baltic countries, about 10,000 Estonian civilians were deported to [[Siberia]] and other remote areas of the Soviet Union, where nearly half of them later perished. Of the 32,100 Estonian men who were forcibly relocated to Russia under the pretext of mobilisation into the Soviet army after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, nearly 40 percent died within the next year in the so-called "[[labour battalion]]s" through hunger, cold and overworking. During the first Soviet occupation of 1940-41 about 500 Jews were deported to [[Siberia]]
Estonian graveyards and monuments were destroyed. Among others, the [[Tallinn Military Cemetery]] had the majority of gravestones from 1918–1944 destroyed by the Soviet authorities, and this graveyard became reused by the [[Red Army]].<ref>[http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1046181016323&a=KArticle&aid=1119525615664 Linda Soomre Memorial Plaque] at britishembassy.gov.uk </ref>
Other cemeteries destroyed by the authorities during the Soviet era in Estonia include [[Baltic German]] cemeteries established in 1774 [[Kopli cemetery]], [[Mõigu cemetery]] and the oldest cemetery in Tallinn, from 16th century, [[Kalamaja cemetery]].

Many countries including the United States did not recognize the seizure of Estonia by the USSR. Such countries recognized  Estonian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in many countries in the name of their former governments. These aging diplomats persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Baltic independence.

[[Ernst Jaakson]], the longest-serving foreign diplomatic representative to the United States, served as vice-consul from [[1934]], and as [[Consul General]] in charge of the Estonian legation in the United States from [[1965]] until reestablishment of Estonia's independence. On [[November 25]], [[1991]] he presented credentials as Estonian ambassador to the United States.<ref>Diplomats Without a Country: Baltic Diplomacy, International Law, and the Cold War by James T. McHugh , James S. Pacy  ISBN 0313318786</ref>

===German Occupation===
{{main|Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany}}
After [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the [[Soviet Union]] on [[June 22]], [[1941]], and the Wehrmacht reached Estonia in July 1941, most Estonians greeted the Germans with relatively open arms and hoped to restore independence. But it soon became clear that sovereignty was out of the question. Estonia became a part of the German-occupied "[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]". A [[Sicherheitspolizei]] was established for internal security under the leadership of [[Ain-Ervin Mere]]. The initial enthusiasm that accompanied the liberation from Soviet occupation quickly waned as a result and the Germans had limited success in recruiting volunteers. The draft was introduced in 1942, resulting in some 3400 men fleeing to Finland to fight in the Finnish Army rather than join the Germans. [[Finnish Infantry Regiment 200]] AKA (Estonian: ''soomepoisid'') was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland. With the Allied victory over Germany becoming certain in 1944, the only option to save Estonia's independence was to stave off a new Soviet invasion of Estonia until Germany's capitulation. 

By January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Soviet Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. [[Narva]] was evacuated. [[Jüri Uluots]], the last legitimate prime minister of the Republic of Estonia (according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia) prior to its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940, delivered a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38.000 volunteers jammed registration centers. <ref>Resistance! Occupied Europe and Its Defiance of Hitler (Paperback) 
by Dave Lande on Page 200 ISBN 0760307458</ref> Several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish army came back across the [[Gulf of Finland]] to join the newly formed  Territorial Defense Force, assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance. It was hoped that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for the cause of Estonia's independence from the USSR and thus ultimately succeed in achieving independence. <ref> The Baltic States: The National Self-Determination of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 
Graham Smith p.91 ISBN 0312161921 </ref>
The initial formation of the volunteer SS Estonian [[wikt:Legion|legion]] created in 1942 was eventually expanded to become a full-sized conscript division of the [[Waffen SS]] in 1944, the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)]]. The Estonian units saw action defending the [[Battle of Narva (1944)|Narva line]] throughout 1944. 

As the Germans retreated in September 1944, [[Jüri Uluots]], the last Prime Minister of the Estonian Republic prior to Soviet occupation, assumed the responsibilities of president (as dictated in the Constitution) and appointed a new government while seeking recognition from the [[Allies]].  The new government fled to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and operated in exile until 1992, when [[Heinrich Mark]], the prime minister of the Estonian government in exile acting as president, presented his credentials to incoming president [[Lennart Meri]].

===The holocaust===
'''Historical background''' {{main|History of the Jews in Estonia}}

The process of Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the nineteenth century, when in 1865 the Russian Tsar [[Alexander II]] granted them the right to enter the region. The creation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 marked the beginning of a new era for the Jews. Approximately 200 Jews fought in combat for the creation of the [[Republic of Estonia]] and 70 of these men were volunteers. From the very first days of her existence as a state, Estonia showed her tolerance towards all the peoples inhabiting her territories. On 12 February 1925 The Estonian government passed a law pertaining to the cultural autonomy of minority peoples. The Jewish community quickly prepared its application for cultural autonomy. Statistics on Jewish citizens were compiled. They totaled 3,045, fulfilling the minimum requirement of 3000. In June 1926 the Jewish Cultural Council was elected and Jewish cultural autonomy was declared. Jewish cultural autonomy was of great interest to global Jewish community. The Jewish National Endowment presented the [[Government of the Republic of Estonia]] with a certificate of gratitude for this achievement.<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Estonia.html?title=Jews_in_Estonia&action=edit</ref>

There were, at the time of Soviet occupation in 1940, approximately 2000 Estonian Jews. Many of Jewish people were deported to Siberia along with other Estonians by the Soviets. It is estimated that 500 Jews suffered this fate. With the invasion of the Baltics, it was the intention of the Nazi government to use the Baltics countries as their main area of mass genocide. Consequently, Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated. Out the approximately 4,300 Jews in Estonia prior to the war, between 1,500 and 2,000 were entrapped by the Nazis. <ref>http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/holocaust.html </ref>
and an estimated 10,000 Jews were killed in Estonia after having been deported to camps there from elsewhere in Eastern Europe. <ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Estonia.html?title=Jews_in_Estonia&action=edit</ref>
There have been knowingly [[Holocaust trials in Soviet Estonia|7 ethnic Estonians]]: Ralf Gerrets, [[Ain-Ervin Mere]], Jaan Viik, Juhan Jüriste, [[Karl Linnas]],Aleksander Laak and Ervin Viks that have faced trials for crimes against humanity.
Since the reestablishment of the Estonian independence [[Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity]] has been established. <ref>http://www.historycommission.ee/</ref> Markers were put in place for the 60th anniversary of the mass executions that were carried out at the Lagedi, Vaivara <ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Vaivara.html</ref> and Klooga (Kalevi-Liiva) camps in September of 1944.<ref>http://www.heritageabroad.gov/projects/estonia1.html</ref>

===Fate of other minorites in and after world war II===
The [[Baltic Germans]] had mainly been evacuated to Germany following the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]]. 

Almost all the remaing [[Estonian Swedes]] fled in August 1944, often in their small boats to the Swedish island of [[Gotland]]. 

The Russian minority grew significantly in numbers durong the postwar era.

===After World War II===

[[Image:Baltic states borders.jpg|thumb|border changes of Estonia after World War II]]

{{main|Estonian SSR}}

In [[World War II]] Estonia had suffered huge losses. Ports had been destroyed, and 45% of industry and 40% of the railways had become damaged.  Estonia's population had decreased by one-fifth, about 200,000 people. Some 10% of the population (over 80,000 people) had fled to the West between 1940 and 1944.  More than 30,000 soldiers had been killed in action. In 1944 Russian [[air raid]]s had destroyed [[Narva]] and one-third of the residential area in [[Tallinn]]. By the late autumn of 1944, Soviet forces had ushered in a second phase of Soviet rule in heels of German troops withdrawing from Estonia, and followed it up by a new wave of arrests and executions of people considered disloyal to the Soviets.{{citation}}

An anti-Soviet [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement known as the [[Forest Brothers|"Metsavennad" ("Forest Brothers")]] developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946-48. It is hard to tell how many people were in the ranks of the ''Metsavennad'', however it is estimated on different times there could be about 30,000–35,000 people. Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in the September of 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.

In March 1949, 20,722 people (2.5% of the population) were deported to Siberia. By the beginning of the 1950s, the occupying regime had suppressed the resistance movement.

After the war the Communist Party of the [[Estonian SSR|Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (ECP) became the pre-eminent organization in the republic. The ethnic Estonian share in the total ECP membership decreased from 90% in 1941 to 48% in 1952.
[[Image:Flag of Estonian SSR.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Estonian SSR]]]]
After [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death, Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized near 50%. On the eve of [[perestroika]] the ECP claimed about 100,000 members; less than half were ethnic Estonians and they totalled less than 2% of the country's population.

One positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the re-permission in the late 1950s of citizens' contacts with foreign countries. Ties were reactivated with [[Finland]], and in the 1960s, a ferry connection was opened from Tallinn to [[Helsinki]] and Estonians began watching Finnish television. This electronic "window on the West" afforded Estonians more information on current affairs and more access to Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union. This heightened media environment was important in preparing Estonians for their vanguard role in extending perestroika during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] era.

In the late 1970s, Estonian society grew increasingly concerned about the threat of cultural Russification to the Estonian language and national identity. By 1981, Russian was taught in the first grade of Estonian language schools and was also introduced into the Estonian pre-school teaching.

By the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The ECP remained stable in the early perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings, and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the [[Estonian Popular Front]], established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership, and broad constituency. The [[Greens]] and the dissident-led [[Estonian National Independence Party]] soon followed. By 1989, the political spectrum widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily.

The republic's [[Supreme Soviet]] transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty ([[November 16]], [[1988]]); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet that November; a language law making Estonian the [[official language]] (January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989).

Although the majority of Estonia's large Russian-speaking diaspora of Soviet-era immigrants did not support full independence, they were divided in their goals for the republic. In March 1990 some 18% of [[Russian language|Russian]] speakers supported the idea of a fully independent Estonia, up from 7% the previous autumn, and by early 1990 only a small minority of ethnic Estonians were opposed to full independence.

==Regaining independence==

Despite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as a new lawmaking body, since 1989 the different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front's proposal, to declare the independence of Estonia as a new, so-called "third republic" whose citizens would be all those living there at the moment found less and less support over time. 

A grassroots Estonian Citizens' Committees Movement launched in 1989 with the objective of registering all pre-war citizens of the Republic of Estonia and their descendants in order to convene a [[Congress of Estonia]]. Their emphasis was on the illegal nature of the Soviet system and that hundreds of thousands inhabitants of Estonia had not ceased to be citizens of Estonian Republic which still existed ''de jure'', recognized by the majority of Western nations. Despite the hostility of the mainstream official press and intimidation by Soviet Estonian authorities, dozens of local citizens' committees were elected by popular initiative all over the country. These quickly organized into a nation-wide structure and by the beginning of 1990, over 900,000 people had registered themselves as citizens of the Republic of Estonia. 

The spring of 1990 saw two free elections and two alternative legislatures developed in Estonia. On [[24 February]] [[1990]], the 464-member Congress of Estonia (including 35 delegates of refugee communities abroad) was elected by the registered citizens of the republic. The Congress of Estonia convened for the first time in Tallinn [[March 11]]–12, 1990, passing 14 declarations and resolutions. A 70-member standing committee ([[Eesti Komitee]]) was elected with [[Tunne Kelam]] as its chairman. 

In the [[March 18]] [[1990]] elections for the 105-member Supreme Soviet all residents of Estonia were eligible to participate, including all Soviet-era immigrants from the U.S.S.R. and approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed there. The Popular Front coalition, composed of [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Centrism|centrist parties]] and led by former [[Central Planning Committee]] official [[Edgar Savisaar]], gained a parliamentary majority. In [[May 8]], 1990, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia (created previous day) restored the Republic of [[Estonia]]. 

In March 1991 a referendum was held on the issue of independence. This was somewhat controversial, as holding a referendum could be taken as signalling that Estonian independence would be established rather than "re"-established. There was some discussion about whether it was appropriate to allow the Russian immigrant minority to vote, or if this decision should be reserved exclusively for citizens of Estonia. In the end all major political parties backed the referendum, considering it most important to send a strong signal to the world. To further legitimise the vote, all residents of Estonia were allowed to participate. The result vindicated these decisions, as the referendum produced a strong endorsement for independence. Turnout was 82%, and 64% of all possible voters in the country backed independence, with only 17% against. 

Through a strict, non-confrontational policy in pursuing independence, Estonia managed to avoid the violence which [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] incurred in the bloody January 1991 crackdowns and in the border customs-post guard murders that summer. During the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)#Yeltsin and the dissolution of the USSR|August coup]] in the U.S.S.R., Estonia was able to maintain constant operation and control of its [[telecommunication]]s facilities, thereby offering the [[Western world|West]] a clear view into the latest coup developments and serving as a conduit for swift Western support and recognition of Estonia's "confirmation" of independence on [[August 20]], [[1991]]. [[August 20]] remains a national holiday in Estonia because of this.  Following Europe's lead, the United States formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Estonia on [[September 2]], and the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet offered recognition on [[September 6]].

Since the debates of whether the future independent Estonia would be established as a new republic or a continuation of the first republic were not yet complete by the time of the August coup, but the members of the Supreme Soviet generally agreed that the independence should be declared rapidly, a compromise was hatched between the two main sides: instead of "declaring" independence, which would imply a new start, or explicitly asserting continuity, the declaration would "confirm" Estonia as a state independent of the Soviet Union, and willing to reestablish diplomatic relations on its own accord.  The full text of the statement is available at [http://www.postimees.ee/080906/esileht/olulised_teemad/15_aastat/213898.php].

After more than 3 years of negotiations, on [[August 31]], [[1994]], the armed forces of [[Russia]] withdrew from Estonia. Since fully regaining independence Estonia has had 12 governments with 8 prime ministers: [[Mart Laar]], [[Andres Tarand]], [[Tiit Vähi]], [[Mart Siimann]], [[Siim Kallas]], [[Juhan Parts]], and [[Andrus Ansip]]. The PMs of the interim government (1990–1992) were [[Edgar Savisaar]] and [[Tiit Vähi]].

Since the last Russian troops left in [[1994]], Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. Estonia opened accession negotiations with the [[European Union]] in 1998 and joined in 2004, shortly after becoming a member of [[NATO]].
