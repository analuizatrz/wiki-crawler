The '''Bacteria''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-bacteria.ogg|[bækˈtɪr.i.ə]}} (''singular'': '''bacterium''') are a large group of unicellular [[microorganism]]s.

[[Louis Pasteur]] demonstrated in 1859 that the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] process is caused by the growth of microorganisms, and that this growth is not due to [[spontaneous generation]]. ([[Yeast]]s and [[mold]]s, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather [[fungus|fungi]].) Along with his contemporary, [[Robert Koch]], Pasteur was an early advocate of the [[germ theory of disease]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/history/articles/pasteur.htm#paperII | title = Pasteur's Papers on the Germ Theory | publisher = LSU Law Center's Medical and Public Health Law Site, Historic Public Health Articles | accessdate = 2006-11-23}}</ref>
Robert Koch was a pioneer in medical microbiology and worked on [[cholera]], [[anthrax]] and [[tuberculosis]]. In his research into tuberculosis, Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1905.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905 | publisher =  Nobelprize.org | accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref> In ''[[Koch's postulates]]'', he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a [[disease]]; these postulates are still used today.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Brien S, Goedert J |title=HIV causes AIDS: Koch's postulates fulfilled |journal=Curr Opin Immunol |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=613–618 |year=1996 |pmid=8902385 |doi=10.1016/S0952-7915(96)80075-6}}</ref>

A major step forward in the study of bacteria was the recognition in 1977 by [[Carl Woese]] that [[archaea]] have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Woese C, Fox G |title=Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: the primary kingdoms |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S a |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=5088–5090 |year=1977|pmid = 270744 |doi=10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088}}</ref> This new [[phylogenetic]] [[taxonomy]] was based on the [[sequencing]] of [[16S ribosomal RNA]], and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the [[three-domain system]].<ref name=Woese>{{cite journal |author=Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M |title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S a |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=4576–9 |year=1990 |pmid=2112744 |doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576}}</ref>

==Origin and early evolution==
{{further|[[Timeline of evolution]]}}

The ancestors of modern bacteria were single-celled microorganisms that were the [[Abiogenesis|first forms of life]] to develop on earth, about 4 billion years ago.

Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from ancient bacteria entering into [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poole A, Penny D |title=Evaluating hypotheses for the origin of eukaryotes |journal=Bioessays |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=74–84 |year=2007 |pmid=17187354 |doi=10.1002/bies.20516}}</ref><ref name=Dyall>{{cite journal |author=Dyall S, Brown M, Johnson P |title=Ancient invasions: from endosymbionts to organelles |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5668 |pages=253&ndash;7 |year=2004 |pmid=15073369 |doi=10.1126/science.1094884}}</ref> This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alpha-proteobacterial symbionts to form either [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] or [[hydrogenosome]]s, which are still being found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g. in ancient "amitochondrial" protozoa). Later on, an independent second engulfment by some mitochondria-containing eukaryotes of cyanobacterial-like organisms led to the formation of [[chloroplast]]s in algae and plants. There are even some algal groups known that clearly originated from subsequent events of endosymbiosis by heterotrophic eukaryotic hosts engulfing a eukaryotic algae that developed into "second-generation" plastids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lang B, Gray M, Burger G |title=Mitochondrial genome evolution and the origin of eukaryotes |journal=Annu Rev Genet |volume=33 |issue= |pages=351–97 |year= 1999|pmid=10690412 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.33.1.351}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=McFadden G |title=Endosymbiosis and evolution of the plant cell |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=513–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10607659 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(99)00025-4}}</ref>

==Morphology==
[[Image:Bacterial morphology diagram.svg|right|thumb|360px|Bacteria display a large diversity of cell [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and arrangements]]

Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes, called ''[[morphology (biology)|morphologies]]''. Bacterial cells are about one tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s in length. However, a few species–for example ''[[Thiomargarita namibiensis]]'' and ''[[Epulopiscium fishelsoni]]''–are up to half a millimetre long and are visible to the unaided eye.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schulz H, Jorgensen B |title=Big bacteria |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=55 |issue=|pages=105&ndash;37 |year=2001|pmid=11544351 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.105}}</ref> Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', which measure only 0.3&nbsp;micrometres, as small as the largest [[virus]]es.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robertson J, Gomersall M, Gill P. |title=Mycoplasma hominis: growth, reproduction, and isolation of small viable cells |journal=J Bacteriol. |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=1007&ndash;18 |year=1975 |pmid=1102522}}</ref> Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these [[ultramicrobacteria]] are not well-studied.<ref name=Velimirov2001>{{cite journal | author = Velimirov, B.

Most bacterial species are either spherical, called [[coccus|cocci]] (''sing''. coccus, from Greek ''kókkos'', grain, seed) or rod-shaped, called [[bacillus|bacilli]] (''sing''. bacillus, from [[Latin]] ''baculus'', stick). Some rod-shaped bacteria, called [[vibrio]], are slightly curved or comma-shaped; others, can be spiral-shaped, called [[spirillum|spirilla]], or tightly coiled, called [[spirochaete]]s. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fritz I, Strömpl C, Abraham W |title=Phylogenetic relationships of the genera Stella, Labrys and Angulomicrobium within the 'Alphaproteobacteria' and description of Angulomicrobium amanitiforme sp. nov | url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/54/3/651 |journal=Int J Syst Evol Microbiol |volume=54 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=651–7 |year=2004|pmid = 15143003 |doi=10.1099/ijs.0.02746-0}}</ref> More recently, deep subsurface bacteria have been discovered that grow as long rods with a star-shaped cross-section.

Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells, others associate in characteristic patterns: ''[[Neisseria]]'' form diploids (pairs), ''[[Streptococcus]]'' form chains, and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' group together in "bunch of grapes" clusters. Bacteria can also be elongated to form filaments, for example the [[Actinobacteria]]. Filamentous bacteria are often surrounded by a sheath that contains many individual cells; certain types, such as species of the genus ''[[Nocardia]]'', even form complex, branched filaments, similar in appearance to fungal [[Mycelium|mycelia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Douwes K, Schmalzbauer E, Linde H, Reisberger E, Fleischer K, Lehn N, Landthaler M, Vogt T |title=Branched filaments no fungus, ovoid bodies no bacteria: Two unusual cases of mycetoma |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=49 |issue=2 Suppl Case Reports |pages=S170&ndash;3 |year=2003 |pmid=12894113 |doi=10.1067/mjd.2003.302}}</ref>

[[Image:Relative scale.svg|thumb|310px|left|The range of sizes shown by [[prokaryote]]s, relative to those of other organisms and [[biomolecule]]s]]

Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called [[biofilm]]s or [[bacterial mat]]s. These films can range from a few micrometers in thickness to up to half a meter in depth, and may contain  multiple species of bacteria, [[protist]]s and [[archaea]]. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Donlan R |title=Biofilms: microbial life on surfaces |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=881–90 |year=2002 |pmid=12194761}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Branda S, Vik S, Friedman L, Kolter R |title=Biofilms: the matrix revisited |journal=Trends Microbiol |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=20–26 |year=2005 |pmid=15639628 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2004.11.006}}</ref> In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms.<ref name=Davey>{{cite journal |author=Davey M, O'toole G |title=Microbial biofilms: from ecology to molecular genetics |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=847–67 |year=2000|pmid = 11104821 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.64.4.847-867.2000}}</ref> Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of [[implant (medicine)|implanted]] medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Donlan RM, Costerton JW |title=Biofilms: survival mechanisms of clinically relevant microorganisms |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=167–93 |year=2002 |pmid=11932229 |doi=10.1128/CMR.15.2.167-193.2002}}</ref>

Even more complex morphological changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, [[Myxobacteria]] detect surrounding cells in a process known as [[quorum sensing]], migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500&nbsp;micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shimkets L |title=Intercellular signaling during fruiting-body development of Myxococcus xanthus |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=53 |issue=|pages=525–49 | year =1999|pmid = 10547700 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.525}}</ref> In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisation.

===Intracellular structures===
The bacterial cell is surrounded by a [[lipid]] membrane, or [[cell membrane]], which encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, [[protein]]s and other essential components of the [[cytoplasm]] within the cell. As they are [[prokaryote]]s, bacteria do not tend to have membrane-bound [[organelle]]s in their cytoplasm and thus contain few large intracellular structures. They consequently lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], [[chloroplast]]s and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells, such as the [[Golgi apparatus]] and [[endoplasmic reticulum]].<ref name=Stryer>{{cite book | author = Berg JM, Tymoczko JL Stryer L | title = Molecular Cell Biology | edition = 5th ed. | publisher = WH Freeman | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7167-4955-6}}</ref> Bacteria were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm, but many levels of structural complexity have now been found, such as the discovery of the [[prokaryotic cytoskeleton]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gitai Z |title=The new bacterial cell biology: moving parts and subcellular architecture |journal=Cell |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=577–86 |year=2005 |pmid=15766522 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.026}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Shih YL, Rothfield L |title=The bacterial cytoskeleton |journal=Microbiol.

===Extracellular structures===
{{further|[[Cell envelope]]}}

Around the outside of the cell membrane is the bacterial [[cell wall]]. Bacterial cell walls are made of [[peptidoglycan]] (called murein in older sources), which is made from [[polysaccharide]] chains cross-linked by unusual [[peptide]]s containing D-[[amino acid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Heijenoort J |title=Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan | url=http://glycob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/11/3/25R |journal=Glycobiology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=25R&ndash;36R |year=2001 |pmid=11320055 |doi=10.1093/glycob/11.3.25R}}</ref> Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]], which are made of [[cellulose]] and [[chitin]], respectively.<ref name=Koch>{{cite journal |author=Koch A |title=Bacterial wall as target for attack: past, present, and future research | url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/16/4/673?view=long&pmid=14557293 |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=673&ndash;87 |year=2003|pmid = 14557293 |doi=10.1128/CMR.16.4.673-687.2003}}</ref> The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic [[penicillin]] is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.<ref name=Koch/>

There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, called [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]]. The names originate from the reaction of cells to the [[Gram stain]], a test long-employed for the classification of bacterial species.<ref name=Gram>{{cite journal | last = Gram | first =  HC | authorlink = Hans Christian Gram |year=1884 |title=Über die isolierte Färbung der Schizomyceten in Schnitt- und Trockenpräparaten |journal=Fortschr.

Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and [[teichoic acid]]s. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing [[lipopolysaccharide]]s and [[lipoprotein]]s. Most bacteria have the Gram-negative cell wall, and only the [[Firmicutes]] and [[Actinobacteria]] (previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have the alternative Gram-positive arrangement.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hugenholtz P |title=Exploring prokaryotic diversity in the genomic era | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11864374 |journal=Genome Biol |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=REVIEWS0003 |year=2002|pmid = 11864374 |doi=10.1186/gb-2002-3-2-reviews0003}}</ref> These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, [[vancomycin]] can kill only Gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against Gram-negative [[pathogen]]s, such as ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walsh F, Amyes S |title=Microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens |journal=Curr Opin Microbiol |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=439–44 |year=2004 |pmid=15451497 |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2004.08.007}}</ref>

[[Flagellum|Flagella]] are rigid protein structures, about 20&nbsp;[[metre|nanometre]]s in diameter and up to 20&nbsp;micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of [[ion]]s down an [[electrochemical gradient]] across the cell membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kojima S, Blair D |title=The bacterial flagellar motor: structure and function of a complex molecular machine |journal=Int Rev Cytol |volume=233 |issue=|pages=93&ndash;134 |year=2004|pmid=15037363 |doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(04)33003-2}}</ref>

[[Fimbria (bacteriology)|Fimbriae]] are fine filaments of protein, just 2–10&nbsp;nanometres in diameter and up to several micrometers in length.

Capsules or slime layers are produced by many bacteria to surround their cells, and vary in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extra-cellular [[polymer]], to a highly structured [[capsule (microbiology)|capsule]] or [[glycocalyx]].

The assembly of these extracellular structures is dependent on bacterial [[secretion|secretion systems]].

Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic [[cyanobacteria]], green sulfur-bacteria and some [[purple bacteria]], but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hellingwerf K, Crielaard W, Hoff W, Matthijs H, Mur L, van Rotterdam B |title=Photobiology of bacteria |journal=Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=331&ndash;47 |year=1994|pmid = 7832590 |doi=10.1007/BF00872217}}</ref> Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on [[phototroph]]y, the use of light through [[photosynthesis]], or on [[chemotroph]]y, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised at the expense of oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).

[[Image:Bluegreen algae.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Filaments of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[cyanobacteria]]]]

Finally, bacteria are further divided into [[lithotroph]]s that use inorganic electron donors and [[organotroph]]s that use organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g. carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds as a source of energy by taking electrons from the [[redox|reduced]] substrate and transferring them to a [[terminal electron acceptor]] in a [[redox|redox reaction]]. This reaction releases energy that can be used to synthesise [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and drive metabolism. In [[aerobic organism]]s, [[oxygen]] is used as the electron acceptor. In [[anaerobic organism]]s other inorganic compounds, such as [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]] or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of [[denitrification]], sulfate reduction and [[acetogenesis]], respectively.

Another way of life of chemotrophs in the absence of possible electron acceptors is fermentation, where the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g. [[lactic acid|lactate]], [[ethanol]], [[hydrogen]], [[butyric acid]]). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zumft W |title=Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification | url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/4/533?view=long&pmid=9409151 |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=533&ndash;616 |year=1997 |pmid=9409151}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Drake H, Daniel S, Küsel K, Matthies C, Kuhner C, Braus-Stromeyer S |title=Acetogenic bacteria: what are the in situ consequences of their diverse metabolic versatilities? |journal=Biofactors |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=13&ndash;24 |year=1997 |pmid=9233536}}</ref>

These processes are also important in biological responses to [[pollution]]; for example, [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] ([[methylmercury|methyl-]] and [[dimethylmercury]]) in the environment.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Morel | first = FMM | coauthors = Kraepiel AML, Amyot M |year=1998 |title=The chemical cycle and bioaccumulation of mercury |journal=Annual Review of Ecological Systems |volume=29|pages = 543–566 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.29.1.543}}</ref> Non-respiratory anaerobes use [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as [[ethanol]] in brewing) as waste. [[Facultative anaerobe]]s can switch between fermentation and different [[terminal electron acceptor]]s depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

Lithotrophic bacteria can use inorganic compounds as a source of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ammonia]] (leading to [[nitrification]]), [[ferrous iron]] and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced [[sulfur]] compounds. Unusually, the gas [[methane]] can be used by [[methanotroph]]ic bacteria as both a source of [[electron]]s and a substrate for carbon anabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dalton H |title=The Leeuwenhoek Lecture 2000 the natural and unnatural history of methane-oxidizing bacteria| url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/yl6umjthf30e4a59/ |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=360 |issue=1458 |pages=1207&ndash;22 |year=2005 |pmid=16147517 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1657}}</ref> In both aerobic phototrophy and [[chemolithotroph]]y, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, while under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.

In addition to fixing carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, some bacteria also fix [[nitrogen]] gas ([[nitrogen fixation]]) using the enzyme [[nitrogenase]]. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of nearly all the metabolic types listed above, but is not universal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zehr J, Jenkins B, Short S, Steward G |title=Nitrogenase gene diversity and microbial community structure: a cross-system comparison |journal=Environ Microbiol |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=539&ndash;54 |year=2003 |pmid=12823187 |doi=10.1046/j.1462-2920.2003.00451.x}}</ref>

==Growth and reproduction==
{{further|[[Bacterial growth]]}}
Unlike multicellular organisms, increases in the size of bacteria ([[cell growth]]) and their reproduction by [[cell division]] are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through [[binary fission]], a form of [[asexual reproduction]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koch A |title=Control of the bacterial cell cycle by cytoplasmic growth |journal=Crit Rev Microbiol |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=61&ndash;77 |year=2002 |pmid=12003041 |doi=10.1080/1040-840291046696}}</ref> Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eagon R |title=Pseudomonas natriegens, a marine bacterium with a generation time of less than 10 minutes | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=13888946 |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=83 |issue=|pages=736&ndash;7 | year =|pmid = 13888946}}</ref> In cell division, two identical [[clone (genetics)|clone]] daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly-formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by ''[[Myxobacteria]]'' and arial [[hypha]]e formation by ''[[Streptomyces]]'', or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.

In the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media such as [[agar plate]]s are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.<ref name=Thomson>{{cite journal |author=Thomson R, Bertram H |title=Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections |journal=Infect Dis Clin North Am |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=1047&ndash;71 |year=2001 |pmid=11780267 |doi=10.1016/S0891-5520(05)70186-0}}</ref>

Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see [[r/K selection theory]]). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of [[algal bloom|algal]] (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paerl H, Fulton R, Moisander P, Dyble J |title=Harmful freshwater algal blooms, with an emphasis on cyanobacteria |journal=ScientificWorldJournal |volume=1 |issue=|pages=76&ndash;113 |year=2001|pmid=12805693 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2001.16}}</ref> Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple [[antibiotic]]s by ''[[Streptomyces]]'' that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Challis G, Hopwood D |title=Synergy and contingency as driving forces for the evolution of multiple secondary metabolite production by Streptomyces species | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/suppl_2/14555 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S a |volume=100 Suppl 2 |issue=|pages=14555&ndash;61 |year=2003|pmid=12970466 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1934677100}}</ref> In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g. [[biofilm]]s) which may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses.<ref name=Davey/> These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ([[syntrophy]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kooijman S, Auger P, Poggiale J, Kooi B |title=Quantitative steps in symbiogenesis and the evolution of homeostasis |journal=Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=435&ndash;63 |year=2003 |pmid=14558592 |doi=10.1017/S1464793102006127}}</ref>

[[Bacterial growth]] follows three phases. When a population of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the [[Lag time|lag phase]], a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Prats C, López D, Giró A, Ferrer J, Valls J |title=Individual-based modelling of bacterial cultures to study the microscopic causes of the lag phase |journal=J Theor Biol |volume=241 |issue=4 |pages=939&ndash;53 |year=2006|pmid = 16524598}}</ref> The second phase of growth is the [[logarithm]]ic phase (log phase), also known as the exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid [[exponential growth]]. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the ''growth rate'' (''k''), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the ''generation time'' (''g''). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The final phase of growth is the ''stationary phase'' and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant|antioxidant metabolism]] and [[active transport|nutrient transport]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hecker M, Völker U |title=General stress response of Bacillus subtilis and other bacteria |journal=Adv Microb Physiol |volume=44 |issue=|pages=35&ndash;91 |year=2001|pmid=11407115 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2911(01)44011-2}}</ref>

==Genetics==

Bacteria may also contain [[plasmid]]s, which are small extra-chromosomal DNAs that may contain genes for [[antibiotic resistance]] or [[virulence|virulence factors]]. Another type of bacterial DNA are [[lysogeny|integrated]] viruses ([[bacteriophage]]s). Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and [[lytic cycle|lyse]] their [[host (biology)|host]] bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to its host's [[phenotype]]: for example, in the evolution of [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] and ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', the [[toxin]] genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacteria into a lethal pathogen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brüssow H, Canchaya C, Hardt W |title=Phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15353570 |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=560–602 |year=2004 |pmid=15353570 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.68.3.560-602.2004}}</ref> Bacteria resist phage infection through [[restriction modification system]]s that degrade foreign DNA,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bickle TA, Krüger DH |title=Biology of DNA restriction |journal=Microbiol.

Bacteria, as asexual organisms, inherit identical copies of their parent's genes (i.e., they are [[clone (genetics)|clonal]]). However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material [[DNA]] caused by [[genetic recombination]] or [[mutation]]s. Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to [[mutagen]]s. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Denamur E, Matic I |title=Evolution of mutation rates in bacteria |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=820&ndash;7 |year=2006 |pmid=16677295 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05150.x}}</ref> Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either random mutation during replication or "stress-directed mutation", where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wright B |title=Stress-directed adaptive mutations and evolution |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=643&ndash;50 |year=2004 |pmid=15101972 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04012.x}}</ref>

Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells. This can occur in three main ways. Firstly, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Genes can also be transferred by the process of [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome. The third method of gene transfer is [[bacterial conjugation]], where DNA is transferred through direct cell contact. This gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called [[horizontal gene transfer]] and may be common under natural conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davison J |title=Genetic exchange between bacteria in the environment |journal=Plasmid |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=73&ndash;91 |year=1999|pmid = 10489325 |doi=10.1006/plas.1999.1421}}</ref> Gene transfer is particularly important in [[antibiotic resistance]] as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hastings P, Rosenberg S, Slack A |title=Antibiotic-induced lateral transfer of antibiotic resistance |journal=Trends Microbiol |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=401&ndash;4 |year=2004 |pmid=15337159 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2004.07.003}}</ref>

[[Image:Flagellum base diagram.svg|thumb|left|350px|Flagellum of Gram-negative Bacteria. The base drives the rotation of the hook and filament.]]

Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum ([[monotrichous]]), a flagellum at each end ([[amphitrichous]]), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell ([[lophotrichous]]), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell ([[peritrichous]]). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly.<ref name=Bardy/> The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a motor at the base that uses the [[electrochemical gradient]] across the membrane for power. This motor drives the motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller. 

Many bacteria (such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'') have two distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional [[random walk]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wu M, Roberts J, Kim S, Koch D, DeLisa M |title=Collective bacterial dynamics revealed using a three-dimensional population-scale defocused particle tracking technique | url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/72/7/4987?view=long&pmid=16820497 |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=72 |issue=7 |pages=4987&ndash;94 |year=2006 |pmid=16820497 |doi=10.1128/AEM.00158-06}}</ref> (See external links below for link to videos.)

They have a distinctive [[helix|helical]] body that twists about as it moves.<ref name=Bardy/>

Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] in behaviors called ''taxes'': these include [[chemotaxis]], [[phototaxis]] and [[magnetotaxis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lux R, Shi W |title=Chemotaxis-guided movements in bacteria |journal=Crit Rev Oral Biol Med |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=207–20 |year=2004 |pmid=15284186}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Frankel R, Bazylinski D, Johnson M, Taylor B |title=Magneto-aerotaxis in marine coccoid bacteria |journal=Biophys J |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=994&ndash;1000 |year=1997 |pmid=9251816}}</ref> In one peculiar group, the [[myxobacteria]], individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The [[myxobacteria]] move only when on solid surfaces, unlike ''E. coli'' which is [[Motility|motile]] in liquid or solid media.

{{further|[[Scientific classification]], [[Systematics]] and [[Clinical pathology]]}}

[[Scientific classification|Classification]] seeks to describe the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified on the basis of cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components such as [[DNA]], [[fatty acid]]s, pigments, [[antigen]]s and [[quinone]]s.<ref name=Thomson/> While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as [[lateral gene transfer]] between unrelated species.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boucher Y, Douady CJ, Papke RT, Walsh DA, Boudreau ME, Nesbo CL, Case RJ, Doolittle WF |title=Lateral gene transfer and the origins of prokaryotic groups |journal=Annu Rev Genet |volume=37 |pages=283–328|year = 2003|pmid=14616063 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247 |unused_data=|http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247}}</ref> Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasizes [[molecular systematics]], using genetic techniques such as [[guanine]] [[cytosine]] [[GC-content|ratio]] determination, genome-genome hybridization, as well as [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the [[ribosomal DNA|rRNA gene]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olsen G, Woese C, Overbeek R |title=The winds of (evolutionary) change: breathing new life into microbiology | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=205007&blobtype=pdf |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=1&ndash;6 |year=1994 |pmid=8282683}}</ref>  Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology,<ref>[http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/ IJSEM - Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology.<ref>[http://www.bergeys.org/ Bergey's Manual Trust<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The term "bacteria" was traditionally applied to all microscopic, single-celled prokaryotes. However, molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate [[domain (biology)|domain]]s, originally called ''Eubacteria'' and ''Archaebacteria'', but now called ''Bacteria'' and ''[[Archaea]]'' that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The archaea and eukaryotes are more closely-related to each other than either is to the bacteria.

Identification of bacteria in the laboratory is particularly relevant in [[medicine]], where the correct treatment is determined by the bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria.

The [[Gram stain]], developed in 1884 by [[Hans Christian Gram]], characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls.<ref name=Gram/> The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the "Gram-positive" cell wall stain purple, while the thin "Gram-negative" cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (Gram-positive cocci, Gram-positive bacilli, Gram-negative cocci and Gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or ''Nocardia'', which show [[acid-fast]]ness on [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain|Ziehl–Neelsen]] or similar stains.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Woods G, Walker D |title=Detection of infection or infectious agents by use of cytologic and histologic stains | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=172900&blobtype=pdf |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=382&ndash;404 |year=1996|pmid = 8809467}}</ref> Other organisms may need to be identified by their growth in special media, or by other techniques, such as [[serology]].

[[Microbiological culture|Culture]] techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting the growth of the other bacteria in the sample. Often these techniques are designed for specific specimens; for example, a [[sputum]] sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause [[pneumonia]], while [[feces|stool]] specimens are cultured on [[selective media]] to identify organisms that cause [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as [[blood]], [[urine]] or [[cerebrospinal fluid|spinal fluid]], are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weinstein M |title=Clinical importance of blood cultures |journal=Clin Lab Med |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=9&ndash;16 |year=1994|pmid = 8181237}}</ref><ref name=Thomson/> Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns such as ([[aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] growth, [[hemolysis (microbiology)|patterns of hemolysis]]) and staining.

As with bacterial classification, identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods. Diagnostics using such DNA-based tools, such as [[polymerase chain reaction]], are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed, compared to culture-based methods.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Louie M, Louie L, Simor AE |title=The role of DNA amplification technology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases |journal=CMAJ | url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/163/3/301 |volume=163 |issue=3 |pages=301–309 |year=2000 |pmid=10951731}}</ref> These methods also allow the detection and identification of "viable but nonculturable" cells that are metabolically active but non-dividing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oliver J |title=The viable but nonculturable state in bacteria | url=http://www.msk.or.kr/jsp/view_old_journalD.jsp?paperSeq=2134 |journal=J Microbiol |volume=43 Spec No |issue= |pages=93–100 |year= |pmid=15765062}}</ref> However, even using these improved methods, the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty. Following present classification, there are fewer than 9,000 known species of bacteria (including cyanobacteria)<ref>[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/02-exec-summary.html#allspecies ABRS - Numbers of living species in Australia and the World Report - Excutive Summary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, but attempts to estimate bacterial diversity have ranged from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> total species - and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Curtis T, Sloan W, Scannell J |title=Estimating prokaryotic diversity and its limits |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12097644 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S a |volume=99 |issue=16 |pages=10494–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12097644 |doi=10.1073/pnas.142680199}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Schloss P, Handelsman J |title=Status of the microbial census |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15590780#r6 |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=686–91 |year=2004 |pmid=15590780 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.68.4.686-691.2004}}</ref>

==Interactions with other organisms==
Despite their apparent simplicity, bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms. These [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations can be divided into [[parasitism]], [[mutualism]] and [[commensalism]]. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and [[Perspiration|sweat]], and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of [[body odor]].

===Mutualists===
Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of [[anaerobic bacteria]] that consume organic acids such as [[butyric acid]] or [[propionic acid]] and produce [[hydrogen]], and [[methanogen]]ic Archaea that consume hydrogen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stams A, de Bok F, Plugge C, van Eekert M, Dolfing J, Schraa G |title=Exocellular electron transfer in anaerobic microbial communities |journal=Environ Microbiol |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=371&ndash;82 |year=2006 |pmid=16478444 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.00989.x}}</ref> The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.

In soil, microorganisms which reside in the [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]] (a zone that includes the [[root]] surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out [[nitrogen fixation]], converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barea J, Pozo M, Azcón R, Azcón-Aguilar C |title=Microbial co-operation in the rhizosphere | url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/417/1761 |journal=J Exp Bot |volume=56 |issue=417 |pages=1761&ndash;78 |year=2005 |pmid=15911555 |doi=10.1093/jxb/eri197}}</ref> This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as [[symbiont]]s [[Bacteria in the human body|in humans]] and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human [[gut flora]] of the [[intestine]]s can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise [[vitamin]]s such as [[folic acid]], [[vitamin K]] and [[biotin]], convert [[Milk#Physical and chemical structure|milk protein]] to [[lactic acid]] (see ''[[Lactobacillus]]''), as well as fermenting complex undigestible [[carbohydrate]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Hara A, Shanahan F |title=The gut flora as a forgotten organ |journal=EMBO Rep |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=688&ndash;93 |year=2006 |pmid=16819463 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400731}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Zoetendal E, Vaughan E, de Vos W |title=A microbial world within us |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=1639&ndash;50 |year=2006 |pmid=16553872 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05056.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorbach S |title=Lactic acid bacteria and human health |journal=Ann Med |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=37&ndash;41 |year=1990|pmid = 2109988 |doi=10.3109/07853899009147239}}</ref> The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through [[competitive exclusion]]) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as [[probiotic]] [[dietary supplement]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salminen S, Gueimonde M, Isolauri E |title=Probiotics that modify disease risk | url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/135/5/1294 |journal=J Nutr |volume=135 |issue=5 |pages=1294&ndash;8 |year=2005 |pmid=15867327}}</ref>

===Pathogens===
{{Main|Pathogenic bacteria}}

[[Image:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Color-enhanced scanning electron micrograph showing ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' (red) invading cultured human cells]]

If bacteria form a parasitic association with other organisms, they are classed as [[pathogen]]s. Pathogenic bacteria are a major cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as [[tetanus]], [[typhoid fever]], [[diphtheria]], [[syphilis]], [[cholera]], [[foodborne illness]], [[leprosy]] and [[tuberculosis]]. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, as was the case with [[Helicobacter pylori]] and [[Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori|peptic ulcer disease]]. Bacterial diseases are also important in [[agriculture]], with bacteria causing [[leaf spot]], [[fire blight]] and [[Wilting|wilts]] in plants, as well as [[Johne's disease]], [[mastitis]], [[salmonella]] and [[anthrax]] in farm animals.

Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Some organisms, such as ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' or ''[[Streptococcus]]'', can cause skin infections, [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and even overwhelming [[sepsis]], a systemic inflammatory response producing [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], massive [[vasodilator|vasodilation]] and death.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fish D |title=Optimal antimicrobial therapy for sepsis |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=59 Suppl 1 |issue=|pages=S13&ndash;9 |year=|pmid=11885408}}</ref> Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the [[nose]] without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the [[Rickettsia]], which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes [[typhus]], while another causes [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]. ''[[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]]'', another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or [[urinary tract infection]] and may be involved in [[coronary heart disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Belland R, Ouellette S, Gieffers J, Byrne G |title=Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerosis |journal=Cell Microbiol |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=117&ndash;27 |year=2004|pmid = 14706098 |doi=10.1046/j.1462-5822.2003.00352.x}}</ref> Finally, some species such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Burkholderia cenocepacia]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium]]'' are [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens]] and cause disease mainly in people suffering from [[immunosuppression]] or [[cystic fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heise E |title=Diseases associated with immunosuppression | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1568899&blobtype=pdf |journal=Environ Health Perspect |volume=43 |issue=|pages=9&ndash;19 |year=1982|pmid=7037390 |doi=10.2307/3429162}}</ref><ref name="Saiman">{{cite journal | last = Saiman | first = L |yar = 2004 |title=Microbiology of early CF lung disease |journal=Paediatr Respir Rev.volume=5 Suppl a |pages=S367&ndash;369}} PMID 14980298</ref>

Bacterial infections may be treated with [[antibiotic]]s, which are classified as [[Bactericide|bacteriocidal]] if they kill bacteria, or [[bacteriostatic]] if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are [[chloramphenicol]] and [[puromycin]], which inhibit the bacterial [[ribosome]], but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yonath A, Bashan A |title=Ribosomal crystallography: initiation, peptide bond formation, and amino acid polymerization are hampered by antibiotics |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=58 |pages=233&ndash;51 |year=2004 |pmid=15487937 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123822}}</ref> Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in [[intensive farming]] to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of [[antibiotic resistance]] in bacterial populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khachatourians G |title=Agricultural use of antibiotics and the evolution and transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=9835883 |journal=CMAJ |volume=159 |issue=9 |pages=1129–36 |year=1998|pmid = 9835883}}</ref> Infections can be prevented by [[antiseptic]] measures such as sterilizating the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] to prevent contamination and infection by bacteria. [[Disinfectant]]s such as [[bleach]] are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.

==Significance in technology and industry==
{{Further|[[Economic importance of bacteria]]}}
Bacteria, often ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' in combination with [[yeast]]s and [[mold]]s, have been used for thousands of years in the preparation of [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] foods such as [[cheese]], [[Pickling|pickle]]s, [[soy sauce]], [[sauerkraut]], [[vinegar]], [[wine]] and [[yoghurt]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson M, Lucey J |title=Major technological advances and trends in cheese |journal=J Dairy Sci |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=1174–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16537950}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hagedorn S, Kaphammer B |title=Microbial biocatalysis in the generation of flavor and fragrance chemicals |journal=Annu.

The ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and [[bioremediation]]. Bacteria capable of digesting the [[hydrocarbon]]s in [[petroleum]] are often used to clean up [[oil spill]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen Y |title=Bioremediation of oil by marine microbial mats |journal=Int Microbiol |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=189&ndash;93 |year=2002 |pmid=12497184 |doi=10.1007/s10123-002-0089-5}}</ref> Fertilizer was added to some of the beaches in [[Prince William Sound]] in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the infamous 1989 [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]]. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the [[bioremediation]] of industrial [[toxic waste]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neves LC, Miyamura TT, Moraes DA, Penna TC, Converti A |title=Biofiltration methods for the removal of phenolic residues |journal=Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. |volume=129-132 |issue= |pages=130–52 |year=2006 |pmid=16915636 |doi=}}</ref> In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of [[enantiomer]]ically pure chemicals for use as [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceuticals]] or [[agrichemical]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liese A, Filho M |title=Production of fine chemicals using biocatalysis |journal=Curr Opin Biotechnol |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=595&ndash;603 |year=1999 |pmid=10600695 |doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(99)00040-3}}</ref>

Bacteria can also be used in the place of [[pesticide]]s in the [[biological pest control]]. This commonly involves ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (also called BT), a Gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a [[Lepidoptera]]n-specific [[insecticide]]s under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aronson AI, Shai Y |title=Why Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxins are so effective: unique features of their mode of action |journal=FEMS Microbiol. Lett. |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11166987 |doi=}}</ref> Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as [[environmentally friendly]], with little or no effect on humans, [[wildlife]], [[pollinator]]s and most other [[beneficial insect]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bozsik A |title=Susceptibility of adult Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) to insecticides with different modes of action |journal=Pest Manag Sci |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=651–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16649191 |doi=10.1002/ps.1221}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chattopadhyay A, Bhatnagar N, Bhatnagar R |title=Bacterial insecticidal toxins |journal=Crit Rev Microbiol |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=33–54 |year=2004 |pmid=15116762 |doi=10.1080/10408410490270712}}</ref>

Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, [[enzyme]]s and [[metabolic pathway]]s in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Serres M, Gopal S, Nahum L, Liang P, Gaasterland T, Riley M |title=A functional update of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11574054 |journal=Genome Biol |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=RESEARCH0035 |year=2001 |pmid=11574054 |doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-9-research0035}}</ref> This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme kinetic]] and [[gene expression]] data into mathematical models of entire organisms.
