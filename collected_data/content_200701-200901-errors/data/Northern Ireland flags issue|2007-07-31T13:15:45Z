The '''Northern Ireland flags issue''' is one that divides the population along [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] lines. Depending on political allegiance, people identify with differing [[flag]]s and symbols, some of which have, or have had, official status in the province.

There are various proposals as to what flag could represent [[Northern Ireland]]'s various communities as a whole; see [[Northern Ireland flags issue#Possible Replacements|below]] for some suggestions.

==Prominent flags displayed==

===Union Flag===
[[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|border|200px|left]]
The flag of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Union Flag]] or ''Union Jack'', is the only official flag used in Northern Ireland.<ref>http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/adhocs/flags/flags.pdf</ref> It is made from an amalgamation of the crosses of [[Cross of St Andrew|St. Andrew]] (representing [[Scotland]]), [[Flag of England|St. George]] (representing [[England]]) and [[Flag of St. Patrick#Saint Patrick.27s Flag|St. Patrick]] (representing [[Ireland]]).

The Union Flag is often flown by [[unionist (Northern Ireland)|unionists]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] but is disliked by many [[Irish Nationalist|nationalists]] and [[Irish Republican|republicans]].<br clear ="all">

===The former official flag of the Government of Northern Ireland===
[[Image:Flag of Northern Ireland.svg|border|200px|left]]The [[Ulster Banner]], the former [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland]] flag, was used from 1953-1972 by the devolved [[Stormont]] government to represent the government of Northern Ireland (though, like other flags in the United Kingdom, it never had any civic status) <ref>Encyclopdeia Britannica says: According to British tradition, a coat of arms or flag is granted to the government of a territory, not to the people residing there. Therefore, when the government of Northern Ireland was disbanded in March 1972, its arms and flag officially disappeared; however, the flag continues to be used by groups (such as sports teams) representing the territory in an unofficial manner.</ref>. It is currently still considered by many Unionists to be the de facto civil flag to uniquely represent Northern Ireland, even though its official government use ended when the Government of Northern Ireland was abolished under the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]]. It continues to be used by sports teams representing Northern Ireland, for example by the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland football team]]<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/confederations/associationdetails/0,1483,NIR,00.html?countrycode=NIR FIFA website]</ref>, and by the Northern Ireland [[Commonwealth Games]] team<ref>http://www.commonwealthgames.com/ Commonwealth Games website. Choose "Northern Ireland" from the "Countries" menu.</ref>. Some local councils, such as the predominantly-unionist [[Castlereagh Borough Council|Castlereagh]], continue to fly it outside their offices.<ref>http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-u-cre.html</ref>

[[Image:Northern Ireland coat of arms.png|200px|thumb|Coat of Arms of the Government of Northern Ireland upon which the Ulster Banner is based|right]]
The flag dates from 1953, though the design (which appears in the [[Coat of Arms of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland coat of arms]] which dates from 1924) is based on the [[Flag of Ulster|flag of the Irish province of Ulster]] which covered what is now Northern Ireland and three counties of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. There are three differences with the Flag of Ulster, namely the white background, the six-pointed star (representing the six Northern Ireland counties) and the crown.

This flag is often flown by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] and in many republican minds has become associated with loyalist paramilitaries. For this reason, and its inclusion of the [[British Crown]], it is disliked by many nationalists and republicans who consider it to be sectarian.

Although some unionists would wish to see this flag used in the future as a Northern Ireland civil flag with governmental status, such a move would be unlikely to receive cross-community support.

===Irish Tricolour===
[[Image:Flag of Ireland.svg|border|200px|left]]
The flag of the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Irish Tricolour]] is regularly flown by Republicans and Nationalists to show their support for a [[United Ireland]]. The colours represent Irish [[Catholics]] (green), [[Protestants]] (orange) and the desire for peace (white) and was originally designed by [[Irish Nationalists]] in the 19th century to represent a united independent island. In its original 19th century form, the orange band was at the mast-side of the flag. 
In the early 20th century when the flag was re-adopted by Irish nationalists it was altered to have the green band closest to the mast. The [[Irish Tricolour]] is regularly flown by Republicans in Northern Ireland to show their support for a [[United Ireland]] and their opposition to British rule.  

The [[Flags and Emblems Act]], [[1954]] which had been enacted by the Unionist Government at Stormont restricted the display of flags and emblems which would cause a breach of the peace, which in practical terms effected the Tricolour most often. This act was subsequently repealed by the UK Government at [[Westminster]].

The flying of the Irish Tricolour by nationalists in Northern Ireland on St Patrick's Day has caused some controversy, as St Patrick is the patron saint of the whole of Ireland, not just the Republic or its citizens.

Some local councils have debated the usage of the flag. Belfast City Council for example, had this flag in the Lord Mayor's official office, when put in place by former [[Sinn FÃ©in]] Lord Mayor [[Alex Maskey]], MLA, along with the Union Flag. When the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]]'s (SDLP) [[Alban McGuinness]] was previously [[Lord Mayor]], however, he side-stepped the issue by having neither flag in his office.

Usage of the flag in Northern Ireland has been debated in recent years, with Belfast City Council discussing (in September 2003), amongst other things, using the flag to fly alongside the Union Flag on designated occasions. The debate, however, all but collapsed after the long term suspension of the Northern Ireland government.

==Flags and emblems no longer in official use==

===Cross of Saint Patrick===
[[Image:St Patrick's saltire3.svg|border|200px|left]]The [[Cross of St Patrick]] is a red [[saltire]] (X-shaped cross) on a white field (background). It may have been based on the arms of the [[FitzGerald|Fitzgerald family]]<ref>http://www.qualityflags.co.uk/history_of_the_union_jack.htm</ref> and is believed by some to be unrelated to [[Saint Patrick]], Ireland's [[patron saint]]. It was used in an official capacity before the [[Partition of Ireland]] and forms part of the [[Union Flag]]. Devised in 1783, one theory for it basis is that similar badges were worn on [[St Patrick's Day]].<ref>[http://www.doyle.com.au/st_pats_flag.htm]</ref> It is still used on St Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland where it has been waved by individuals and flown at some council offices (notably Belfast City Hall).<ref>[http://www.everythingulster.com/blogs/index.php/everythingulster/2006/03/17/p398#more398 "Paddy's Day Belfast Bash"] from [[Everything Ulster]], [[17 March]] 2006</ref> In the case of the City Hall, this happened first in [[1994]], after the council's Policy and Resource committee had passed a resolution approving its use in January of that year.

It is seen by some as a neutral flag representing the island of Ireland on St Patrick's Day and is used on the emblem of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]].<ref>http://www.ulsternation.org.uk/cross_of_st_patrick.htm</ref>

A number of people wish to see this flag used officially for Northern Ireland, though some nationalists dislike its previous use in British contexts. Others dislike its specific use for Northern Ireland because it is seen as one of the few flags that can be used to represent the entire island of Ireland in a neutral fashion.

==Flags used in an all-Ireland context==
===Ulster Flag===

[[Image:Flag of Ulster.svg|border|200px|left]]
[[Image:Four Provinces Flag.svg|border|200px|right]]
The flag of the nine-county [[Ulster]] is often flown in [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] contexts, though it also appears on the coat of arms of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. It is also often flown by fans at [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster rugby]] matches.  It was the basis for the Government of Northern Ireland flag. <br clear = "all">

The "four provinces flag" incorporates the flags of the four Irish provinces of [[Ulster]], [[Munster]], [[Leinster]] and [[Connacht]]; and is used to represent the entire island of Ireland. It is used by nationalists and by some all-Ireland institutions such as the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] and is intended to be a more neutral flag than the Irish Tricolour.<br clear = "all">

==Other Flags==
===Ulster Nation Flag===
[[Image:Flag of the Ulster Nation.svg|border|200px|left]]
This flag is used by [[Ulster nationalism|Ulster separatists]] who wish to see Northern Ireland leave the United Kingdom and become an independent state, not joining together with the Republic of Ireland. 

The flag is made up of St Andrew's cross (below), St Patrick's Cross (above) and the red hand and star from the Northern Ireland flag (above), with the star coloured yellow (instead of white as in the Ulster Banner) based on the colours of the flag of the Irish province of Ulster.

<br clear = "all">

===St Andrew's Cross===

[[Image:Flag of Scotland.svg|border|200px|left]]
[[St Andrew's Cross]] is the traditional flag of [[Scotland]], and is one of the flags which makes up the Union Flag. It is used by some Loyalists in Northern Ireland to highlight their Scottish ancestry. [[St Andrew]] was one of the disciples of [[Jesus Christ]] and the flag is said to have been inspired by a white cross of cloud appearing on a blue sky to Scottish King preparing for battle.<br clear = "all">

==Possible replacements==

As there is currently no unique official flag for Northern Ireland, there have been various suggestions about what should be done. Apart from reusing an existing flag (such as the Cross of St Patrick), various new designs have been created.

[[Image:Proposed flag of Northern Ireland.svg|border|200px|left]]
This flag was being considered by the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] in the late 1990s and was leaked to [[BBC News]]<ref>BBC Inside Ulster Report circa 1995</ref>. It was never officially proposed. It is essentially the old NI Government Flag with the crown removed and some yellow taken from the Province of Ulster Flag.

When this flag was shown by journalists to various people around [[Belfast]], the reaction was mainly unfavourable. Although some liked its inclusive nature, typical responses were along the lines of "We already have a flag, it's the [[Union Jack]]" or "We already have a flag, it's the [[Irish Tricolour|Tricolour]]".<br clear = all>

[[Image:North flagproposal1111.JPG|border|200px|left]]

Another attempt to create a flag which the community could support is shown here. It was featured on local TV station [[UTV]], and was inspired, in part, by the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] standard, which had been agreed upon by the four main parties. This, in theory, could give the flag a greater degree of validity than other proposed flags.

It uses various symbols to bring together the diverse identities of the Northern Ireland people. In the centre of the flag is [[Saint Patrick's Flag|St. Patrick's Cross]]. The star shape, which no longer bears any resemblance to the Star of David, has six points, representing the six counties. The flag also has six symbols (clockwise from top):


* The [[Scales of Justice]] (representing equality and justice)
* The [[harp]] (a traditional Irish symbol but not the [[Brian Boru harp]] used as official emblem in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]])
* A [[torch]] (representing enlightenment and a new beginning)
* An [[olive branch]] (a peace symbol from [[Ancient Greece]])
* A [[shamrock]] (a traditional Irish symbol, used by [[St Patrick]] to explain the [[Christian]] [[Trinity]])
* A [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] (a traditional symbol of monarchy but not the Crown worn by or representing the [[British Sovereign]])
<br clear = all>

[[Image:Saint Patrick's flag for Northern Ireland.svg|border|200px|left]]This flag is a hybrid between the [[Saint Patrick's Flag|St. Patrick's Cross]]  and the [[Ulster Banner]]. It adds the [[Red Hand of Ulster]] and the six-pointed star to the St. Patrick's Flag, but does not add the crown and dispenses with the [[Flag of England|St. Georges' Cross]] found on the Ulster Banner.
<br clear = all>

[[Image:Alliance flag suggestions.png|200px|left]][[Image:alliance ni flag.png|border|200px|right]]
In [[2003]], the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] (the only Assembly Party that claims to represent both Nationalists and Unionists) came up with a few suggestions. The picture to the left shows a [[BBC]] artist's impression of these ideas, taken from a [[BBC Newsline]] report [http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/video/38673000/rm/_38673479_newflag_vi.ram]. The flags shown represent, from left to right, a flax flower, the map of Northern Ireland (which is also re-created to the right) and a few steps from the [[Giant's Causeway]].  (Compare with the Korean [[Unification Flag]] and the [[Flag of Cyprus]].)
