'''Uranus''' ({{IPA2| jʊˈɹeɪ.nəs, ˈjʊ.ɹə.nəs }}, named after the Greek god of the sky ([[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], ''[[wiktionary:οὐρανός|{{polytonic|Οὐρανός}}]]''), is the seventh [[planet]] from the [[Sun]]. It is a [[gas giant]], the third largest by [[diameter]] and fourth largest by [[mass]]. Its [[astronomy|astronomical]] symbol is [[Image:Uranus symbol.svg|20px|Astronomical symbol for Uranus]]. The symbol is a combination of the devices for the Sun and Mars, as Uranus was the personification of heaven in Greek mythology, dominated by the light of the Sun and the power of Mars. It is also the [[alchemy|alchemical]] symbol of [[platinum]].

Uranus is the first planet discovered in modern times. Sir [[William Herschel]] formally discovered the planet on [[March 13]], [[1781]]; the other planets (from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] out to [[Saturn]]) have been known since ancient times, since they are visible to the naked eye. The discovery of Uranus expanded the boundaries of the [[solar system]] for the first time in modern human history. It was also the first planet discovered using [[technology]] (a [[telescope]]) rather than the [[naked eye]].

== Discovery and naming ==
Uranus is the first planet to be discovered that was not known in ancient times; although it had been observed on many previous occasions, it was often mistakenly identified as a star. The earliest recorded sighting was in [[1690]] when [[John Flamsteed]] catalogued Uranus as 34 [[Taurus (constellation)|Tauri]]. Flamsteed observed Uranus at least six more times. The record belongs to a French astronomer, [[Pierre Lemonnier]], who observed Uranus at least twelve times between [[1750]] and [[1769]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespaceguy.com/Uranus.htm |title=Uranus - About Saying, Finding, and Describing It |last=Dunkerson |first=Duane |publisher=thespaceguy.com |accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>, including on four consecutive nights. (Lemonnier is often{{Fact|date=February 2007}} called careless or even "sloppy" for this, but it is important to know that he realized 9 of these within a short time of Herschel's discovery and most of his observations occurred at the [[stationary point]] in Uranus' orbit.)

Sir [[William Herschel]] discovered the planet on [[March 13]], [[1781]], but reported it on [[April 26]], [[1781]], as a "[[comet]]."<ref>''Account of a Comet, By Mr. Herschel, F. R. S.; Communicated by Dr. Watson, Jun. of Bath, F. R. S.'', Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Volume 71, pp. 492-501.</ref>

:''On the 13th of [[March 13|March]], [[1781]], between ten and eleven o'clock at night, while Herschel was examining the small stars near ''H Geminorum'' with a seven-foot telescope, bearing a magnifying power of two hundred and twenty-seven times, one of these stars seemed to have an unusual diameter; and it was, therefore, thought to be a comet. It was under this denomination that it was discussed at the [[Royal Society]] of [[London]]. But the researches of Herschel and of Laplace showed later that the orbit of the new body was nearly circular, and Uranus was consequently elevated to the rank of a planet.'' <ref name=Arago>M. Arago (1871), ''Herschel'', Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, pp. 198-223</ref>

Herschel originally named it ''Georgium Sidus'' (George's Star) in honour of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] (c.f. American poet Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson's "Upon the Discovery of the Planet..." about the event). When it was pointed out that ''sidus'' means star and not planet, Herschel rebaptised it the ''Georgian Planet''. This name was not acceptable outside of Britain. [[Joseph Jérôme Lefrançais de Lalande|Lalande]] proposed in 1784 to name it ''Herschel'', at the same time that he created the planet's astrological symbol ([[Image:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|20px|]], "a globe surmounted by your [Herschel's] initial"); his proposal was readily adopted by French astronomers. [[Erik Prosperin|Prosperin]], of [[Uppsala]], proposed the names ''[[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]]'', ''[[Cybele]]'', and ''[[Neptune]]'' (now borne by two [[asteroid]]s and another planet). [[Anders Johan Lexell|Lexell]], of [[St. Petersburg]], compromised with ''George III's Neptune'' and ''Great-Britain's Neptune''. [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]], from [[Berlin]], suggested ''Hypercronius'' and ''Transaturnis''. [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]], from [[Göttingen]], chimed in with ''Austräa'', a goddess mentioned by [[Ovid]] (but who is traditionally associated with [[Astraea (mythology)|Virgo]]). The name [[Minerva]] was also proposed.<ref>{{cite journal

Finally, [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]], as editor of the ''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch'', opted for ''Uranus'',<ref name="planetsbeyond">{{Cite book | title=Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System | id=ISBN 0-486-43602-0 | last=Littmann| first=Mark | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=2004 | pages=pp. 10-11}}</ref>

The final holdout was [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]], which did not switch to ''Uranus'' until 1850.<ref name="planetsbeyond"/>

The stressed syllable in the name is properly the first, antepenultimate syllable, since in Latin the penultimate vowel ''a'' is short {{Unicode|(ūr'''ă'''nŭs)}} and in an open syllable, and such syllables are never stressed in Latin.  The historically correct pronunciation of the name by English-speakers is therefore {{IPA|[ ˈjʊ.rə.nəs ]}}.  The historically incorrect pronunciation {{IPA|[ jʊˈɹeɪ.nəs ]}}, with stress on the second syllable and a "long a" {{Unicode|(ūr'''ā'''nŭs)}} have become very common, however, perhaps through the influence of the related adjective "Uranian" (always pronounced {{IPA|[ jʊˈɹeɪ.ni.ən ]}} or the similarly-pronounced name of the element [[uranium]].

In the [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] languages, the planet's name is literally translated as the ''sky king star'' (天王星),<ref>{{cite web

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Composition ===
Uranus is composed primarily of gas and various ices.  The atmosphere is about 83 percent [[hydrogen]], 15 percent [[helium]], 2 percent [[methane]] and traces of [[acetylene]]. The interior is richer in heavier elements, most likely compounds of oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, as well as rocky materials. This is in contrast to [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] which are mostly hydrogen and helium. Uranus (like [[Neptune]]) is very much similar to the cores of Jupiter and Saturn without the massive fluid [[metallic hydrogen]] envelope.  Uranus' [[cyan]] color is due to the absorption of [[red]] light by atmospheric [[methane]]. Surface temperature on Uranus' cloud cover is approximately 55&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (−218&nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] or −360&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]).<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume = 31|pages= 217-263|year= 1993|doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.31.090193.001245|title=The Atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune|author= Lunine J. I.}}</ref>

===Axial tilt===
One of the most distinctive features of Uranus is its axial tilt of ninety-eight degrees. Consequently, for part of its orbit one pole faces the [[Sun]] continually while the other pole faces away. At the other side of Uranus's orbit the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed.  This gives each pole 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of darkness. Between these two extremes of its orbit, particularly at the [[equinox]]es, the Sun rises and sets around the equator normally. Uranus will reach its next equinox around [[December]] [[2007]], and not again until [[2049]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061001211630.htm |title=Hubble Discovers Dark Cloud In The Atmosphere Of Uranus |publisher=Science Daily |date=2006-10-02 |accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref>

At the time of ''[[Voyager 2]]'''s passage in 1986, Uranus' south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun. The labelling of this pole as "south" uses the coordinate definitions currently endorsed by the [[International Astronomical Union]], namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite shall be the pole which points above the invariable plane of the solar system (regardless of the direction the planet is spinning).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hnsky.org/iau-iag.htm |title=REPORT OF THE IAU/IAG WORKING GROUP ON CARTOGRAPHIC COORDINATES AND ROTATIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE PLANETS AND SATELLITES: 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/sr/stdref_021015/Chapter02.pdf |title=Cartographic Standards |publisher=NASA}}</ref>  A different system is sometimes used, defining a body's north and south poles according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://roger.ecn.purdue.edu/~masl/documents/masl/coords.html |title=Coordinate Frames Used in MASL}}</ref> In terms of this latter coordinate system it was Uranus' ''north'' pole which was in sunlight in 1986. On page 47 of the September 2006 issue of the Sky at Night magazine, [[Patrick Moore]], commenting on the issue, sums up "take your pick!" 

One result of this orientation is that the polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Uranus is nevertheless hotter at its equator than at its poles, although the underlying mechanism which causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus' extreme axial tilt is also not known. It is speculated that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth sized [[protoplanet]] collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.<ref>Bergstralh, Jay T., Ellis Miner, Mildred Matthews. eds. ''Uranus''. 1991 University of Arizona P; Tucson. pg. 485-486.</ref>

It appears that Uranus' extreme axial tilt also results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather. During the Voyager 2 flyby, Uranus' banded cloud patterns were extremely bland and faint. Recent [[Hubble Space Telescope]] observations, however, show a more strongly banded appearance now that the Sun's overhead position relative to Uranus is approaching Uranus' equator. By 2007 the Sun will be directly over Uranus' equator.

===Magnetic field===
Uranus's [[magnetic field]] is peculiar since it is not originating from the geometric center of the planet and is tilted almost 60° from the axis of rotation. It is probably generated by motion at relatively shallow depths within Uranus. Neptune has a similarly displaced magnetic field, which suggests the magnetic field is not necessarily a consequence of Uranus' axial tilt. The [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] is twisted by the planet's rotation into a long corkscrew shape behind the planet. The magnetic field's source is unknown.

===Explanation for bland atmosphere===

The internal heat of Uranus is lower than that of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. Both Jupiter and Saturn radiate more energy than they receive from the Sun.
This causes many powerful convection currents to form in the atmosphere. On Uranus that heat source is much lower due to its lower mass, with the temperature of its core roughly 7000 K compared to 30 000 K at Jupiter's core and 18 000 K at Saturn. The convection currents formed in the Uranian atmosphere are not as strong and hence it lacks the atmosphere banding of the larger gas giants. However, as stated above, the weather patterns of Uranus do vary with season, being more pronounced at the [[equinoxes]] than at the [[solstices]].

===Cloud features===

For a short period in Autumn 2004, a number of large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a [[Neptune]]-like appearance.<ref>{{cite web

==Planetary rings==
{{main|Rings of Uranus}}
[[Image:Uranus with rings PIA01280.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Uranus with its rings in false color]]
Uranus has a faint [[planetary ring]] system, composed of dark particulate matter up to ten meters in diameter. 
The first mention of Uranus's ring system comes from [[William Herschel]]'s notes detailing his observations of Uranus. These include the following passage: "February 22, 1789: A ring was suspected".<ref>{{Cite press release
|title=Uranus rings 'were seen in 1700s'
|publisher=BBC News
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6569849.stm
|date=[[2007-04-19]]| accessdate=2007-04-19}}
</ref>
Herschel drew a small diagram of the ring and noted that it was "a little inclined to the red". The Keck Telescope in Hawaii has since confirmed this to be the case. Herschel's notes were published in a Royal Society journal in 1797. Between 1797 and 1977 the rings are rarely mentioned, if at all. This might be the result of the unfavourable inclination of the ring system for part of the intervening period, or due to a reduction in the brightness of the ring system. The ring system was rediscovered on March 10, 1977 by [[James L. Elliot]], [[Edward W. Dunham]], and [[Douglas J. Mink]] using the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]]. The discovery was [[Serendipity|serendipitous]]; they planned to use the [[occultation]] of the star SAO 158687 by Uranus to study the planet's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. However, when their observations were analyzed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind the planet. They concluded that there must be a ring system around the planet; it was directly imaged when ''[[Voyager 2]]'' passed Uranus in 1986. 

In December 2005, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located at twice the distance from the planet than the previously known rings. The new rings are so far from the planet that they are being called Uranus' "outer" ring system.  Hubble also spotted two small satellites. One, [[Mab (moon)|Mab]], shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring.  These two rings bring the total number of Uranus rings to 13.

In April 2006, images of the new rings with the [[Keck Observatory]] yielded the colors of the outer rings: one was blue and the other red.<ref>{{Cite press release

A marked similarity to the colorful E and G rings of [[Saturn]] may be a coincidence, or it may be related to a similar causal mechanism.  The source of the rings' colors are still an area of active research. The planet's inner rings appear grey.

==Exploration==
{{main|Exploration of Uranus}}
[[NASA]]'s ''[[Voyager 2]]'' is the only spacecraft to have visited the planet and no other visits are currently planned. Launched in 1977, ''Voyager 2'' made its closest approach to Uranus on [[January 24]], [[1986]], before continuing its journey to [[Neptune]]. ''Voyager 2'' discovered 10 previously unknown [[Uranus' natural satellites|moons]]; studied the planet's unique atmosphere, caused by its [[axial tilt]] of 97.77°; and examined its [[Rings of Uranus|ring system]]. In its first solo planetary flyby, Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Uranus on January 24, 1986, coming within 81,500 kilometers (50,600 miles) of the planet's cloud tops.
[[Image:Uranus_Final_Image.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of Uranus taken by [[Voyager 2]] as it headed to Neptune.]]

Voyager 2 found that one of the most striking influences of Uranus' sideways position is its effect on the tail of the magnetic field, which is itself tilted 60 degrees from the planet's axis of rotation. The magnetotail was shown to be twisted by the planet's rotation into a long corkscrew shape behind the planet. The presence of a magnetic field at Uranus was not known until Voyager's arrival.

Radiation belts at Uranus were found to be of an intensity similar to those at [[Saturn]]. The intensity of radiation within the belts is such that irradiation would quickly darken (within 100,000 years) any methane trapped in the icy surfaces of the inner moons and ring particles. This may have contributed to the darkened surfaces of the moons and ring particles, which are almost uniformly gray in color.

A high layer of haze was detected around the sunlit pole, which also was found to radiate large amounts of ultraviolet light, a phenomenon dubbed "dayglow." The average temperature is about 60 kelvins (-350 degrees Fahrenheit). Surprisingly, the illuminated and dark poles, and most of the planet, show nearly the same temperature at the cloud tops.

The moon [[Miranda]], innermost of the five large moons, was revealed to be one of the strangest bodies yet seen in the solar system. Detailed images from Voyager's flyby of the moon showed huge fault canyons as deep as 20 kilometers (12 miles), terraced layers, and a mixture of old and young surfaces. One theory holds that Miranda may be a reaggregation of material from an earlier time when the moon was fractured by a violent impact.

All nine previously known rings were studied by the spacecraft and showed the Uranian rings to be distinctly different from those at Jupiter and Saturn. The ring system may be relatively young and did not form at the same time as Uranus. Particles that make up the rings may be remnants of a moon that was broken by a high-velocity impact or torn up by gravitational effects.

==Natural satellites==
[[Image:Uranian moon montage.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Uranian moon montage]]
{{main|Uranus' natural satellites}}
{{seealso|Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites}}
Uranus has 27 known [[natural satellites]]. The names for these satellites are chosen from characters from the works of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Alexander Pope]]. The five main satellites are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].

The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among the gas giants; indeed, the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] alone.  The moons are low-[[albedo]], ice-rock conglomerates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Voyager Uranus Science Summary |url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/vgrur.htm  |accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

==Visibility==
[[Image:Uranus, Earth size comparison.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Size comparison of Earth and Uranus]]
The brightness of Uranus is between magnitude +5.5 and +6.0.  Thus, under dark sky conditions it can be seen with the naked eye as a faint star.   From Earth, it has a diameter of four arcseconds.  It is an easy target with binoculars.  In larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter greater than 12" (30 cm), the planet appears as a pale blue disk with distinct [[limb darkening]].  The larger satellites, [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], may be visible.   Because of its faintness and slow apparent motion, it was never recognised as a planet by ancient astronomers.

As the planet approaches its 2007 equinox, dynamic cloud activity is developing.
Most of the activity requires [[Hubble Space Telescope]] or large telescopes with [[adaptive optics]] to be detectable.  However, some features may become bright enough to be seen with moderately large amateur telescopes.  In 2006, a Dark Spot was detected in visible-wavelength [[Hubble]] images, suggesting that the atmosphere of Uranus near equinox is becoming more like that of Neptune.
