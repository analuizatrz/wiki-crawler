'''''Ninja Gaiden''''' is a 2004 [[action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Team Ninja]]. It is the fifth original release in the Ninja Gaiden video game series and the first for the [[Xbox]] console. An enhanced version was released on the Xbox in 2005 as Ninja Gaiden Black. It was later ported to the [[PlayStation 3]] in 2007 in the form of Ninja Gaiden Sigma.

The game features the Dragon Ninja, ''[[Ryu Hayabusa]]'' as the protagonist
. Throughout the course of the game he has to defeat hordes of enemies and go through a variety of challenging environments to reacquire the stolen Dark Dragon Blade.

The game was a revival of the [[Ninja Gaiden (series)|Ninja Gaiden]] series, being the first addition for more than nine years, and was released to much critical acclaim with some considering it the best videogame ever made. Much like it was with previous installments in the series (mostly, the ones developed by [[Sega]]), this game was released worldwide as a ''Ninja Gaiden'' title, and the old regional retitles of ''Ninja Ryūkenden'' (忍者龍剣伝) in Japan and ''Shadow Warriors'' in Europe were discontinued.

===Development===
The "Next-Generation Ninja Gaiden Project" began in 1999; it was originally intended to be a game for the [[Sega NAOMI]] [[arcade system board]]. The game's development cycle was plagued by several delays and changes of platform: first to the [[Sega Dreamcast]], then as a launch title for the [[Playstation 2]].[http://www.gamespot.com/news/2450994.html?q=ninja%20gaiden%202] Finally, in 2001 Tecmo announced that [[Ninja Gaiden (series)|Ninja Gaiden]] would be exclusive to the [[Xbox]]. A demo was available one month before the game's release in early 2004.

Two "Hurricane Packs" were released as downloadable content via the [[Xbox Live]] service. The first made the game even harder and featured various changes to the location of items and enemies, with unlockable costumes available. The second was part of a Master Ninja Tournament, where players competed in a special set of levels to gain the highest "Karma" scores. As an honorary mention, the user names of the highest scoring participants of this tournament were put on display in the ending credits of ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', a further upgraded version released in 2005.

===Plot===
The Xbox ''Ninja Gaiden'' contains no story elements from the [[NES]] trilogy apart from minor references and recurring characters that play very similar roles to those of the original trilogy. This essentially makes it a reboot of the Ninja Gaiden "universe", although the story could be placed either before or after the events of the original trilogy. However, game director [[Tomonobu Itagaki]] commented in an interview that "Since this is a brand-new game, I prefer not to be influenced by or base it on the original story".<ref name="plot">{{cite news

====Summary====
The story revolves around the Dark Dragon Blade and the Dragon Sword.

The Dark Dragon Blade was forged from the bones of the evil Black Dragon. It has been sealed away and is protected by the warriors of the Dragon Lineage. Their descendants, the Hayabusa ninja clan, now serve as the guardians of this evil artifact.

The Dragon Sword was forged from the tooth of one of the good dragons. Passed down from generation to generation of the Dragon Lineage, it was instrumental in their defeating and sealing the forces of evil. The current guardian of the sword is the ninja, Ryu Hayabusa.

Ninja Gaiden starts off with Ryu bloodily infiltrating the Shadow Clan's ninja fortress seeking a visit with his uncle, Murai, the leader of the Shadow Clan. In the middle of their conversation, a young ninja, Ayane barges in, informing them the Hayabusa village was under attack. Ryu rushes and fights his way back to find his village in ruins. He encounters Doku who has taken the Dark Dragon Blade. Doku cuts down Ryu with the blade and the chapter concludes with a view of a falcon, the Hayabusa's spirit animal, overlooking the fallen Ryu.

Informed by Murai that the Vigoor Empire was responsible for the attack and theft, Ryu decides to stowaway onboard an airship and sneak into Vigoor. His presence was known, and MSATs under General Dynamo were directed to board the airship and search for Ryu. Dynamo was defeated by Ryu, and his overloading circuits caused the airships to explode. Ryu managed to escape the explosion and slid on power line cables into Tairon.

Moving through Tairon, Ryu encounters Muramasa in his shop, and a Demon Hunter named Rachel. Rachel informs Ryu of the blood curse which can turn people into fiends. Rachel is on a mission to liberate her twin sister, Alma who had been captured and turned into a fiend, from this state of existence.

By this time, Ryu had also met the mysterious Gamov, who was actually working with the Dark Disciple in the employ of the Vigoor Empire. Ryu fights his way through the streets, ending up in the Monastery. After going through and flooding the catacombs of the Monastery, Ryu ends up encountering Alma in the main Altar Hall itself. Alma was defeated and the tremendous release of energy left the Monastery in ruins. Rachel arrived at this point, but finds herself unable to kill her sister.

Ryu leaves them to continue his mission, and it is at this point, Doku came and captured Rachel. The Vigoor Army has been put on alert by the explosion and are now enforcing a curfew of Tairon. Ryu fights his way into the Military Base, and crashed a locomotive into another, igniting another tremendous explosion which takes out city blocks. In a bid to escape the scene, Ryu enters the city's Aqueducts.

[[Image:Kyoiori RyuVsDoku0000.png|thumb|right|240px|Ryu fights with Doku.]]
Navigating through the Aqueducts, Ryu defeats the resurrected Paz Zuu, and found himself on the edge of the moat surrounding Zarkhan, the capital. Swimming through the moat, he managed to find a way back into the catacombs where he went up an elevator into the Stadium. It is there where he faces off and defeats Doku, thereby rescuing Rachel. Doku's physical body was defeated but his spirit flees to continue the fight. Rachel goes off to pursue him.

Left alone, Ryu manages to enter the caverns, and defeats Smaugan, the dragon guarding the statue of the Devil, Deity of Immortality. He has also managed to retrieve the remains of the Tablet needed to reactivate the portal networks. Muramasa informs Ryu that his Dragon Sword is yet complete, and Ryu goes back via the portals, to his village and retrieves the Dragon Eye from Kureha's grave, thereby completing his sword to be the True Dragon Sword. Venturing through the portal network, he arrives at the Pyramid to witness Spirit Doku about to sacrifice Rachel, and Alma's Awakening.

Defeating Awakened Alma, Ryu rushes to prevent Rachel's sacrifice but Awakened Alma beats him to it. Shielding her sister, Awakened Alma was pierced by Spirit Doku's sword, and reverts back to her human form. Spirit Doku leaves in disgust. Ryu leaves the twins and enters the Pyramid. He manages to make the Pyramid rise and gains access to the Labyrinth. It is in the Labyrinth that he finishes Spirit Doku off once and for all. However with his last breath, Spirit Doku places a curse upon Ryu which will gradually turn him into a fiend. The only way to lift this curse is to kill the Vigoor Emperor.

Ryu fights his way into the Palace Core, venturing into the Nether Realms where he slayed Marbus to obtain the final statue needed to unlock the Gates of Hell. Stepping onto the stairways beyond, he fell into the realm of the Vigoor Emperor who is standing guard over the Dark Dragon Blade. Ryu defeats the Vigoor Emperor twice, causing his realm to start collapsing. Ryu with the help of Rachel, manages to escape its collapse with the Dark Dragon Blade.

Flung out of the collapsing realm, the Dark Dragon Blade lands at the feet of the Dark Disciple who slaughters Gamov with it. Revealing his identity to be Murai, the Dark Disciple reveals that the plan was to get Ryu to slaughter thousands in the name of the Dark Dragon Blade, thus feeding it with the dead, and gorging it with power. Murai who had lusted for the power of the Dark Dragon Blade for so long, finally has it in his hands. The overwhelming dark power of the Blade transforms him into a Fiend, and the final fight is engaged.

Defeating and casting Fiend Murai into a dark abyss, Ryu decides to end the saga of the Dark Dragon Blade once and for all by shattering it with the True Dragon Sword. Simply stating that the whole quest is over, Ryu transforms into the Hayabusa's spirit animal, a falcon, and flies back to the Hayabusa village where he places back the Dragon Eye on Kureha's grave.

===Gameplay===
Ninja Gaiden's play takes the form of Story Mode. The whole game is split into 16 chapters. Once you start off in a chapter, you have free reign to roam about. There are areas are closed off to the player from the start, but once unlocked, the player can go back to them. Exceptions are the Ninja Fortress, the Airship, and the Military Base due to the plot. There are also plot elements which will restrict the player's movement to certain areas within a chapter. The player's progress must be saved at a save point, which resembles a dragon statue, if the player wishes to continue his play at another time.

CG rendered movies are typically played at the beginning and ending of a chapter. The player must watch the entirety of a movie on its first playing, however the movie can be skipped on subsequent replays. There are also in-game cutscenes in the game.

Score-wise (score being known as karma in this game), the game is concerned with how fast a player is able to finish off an encounter. Finishing off an encounter within time limits will award the player with a time bonus. At the end of the chapter, the game will award bonuses based on how fast the player clears the chapter, how many foes were killed, how much more essence than the beginning of the chapter the player has, and how much full 'ki' slots the player has at the end.

After completing a particular difficulty's Story Mode, the player is given the option to save his completed game. An option to play this saved game is then offered (Successive Play). Despite its name, the player starts off playing Story Mode again on that difficulty with only the starting equipment and statistics. The only things the player can keep from the completed game are the scarabs (which he can exchange for slightly earlier rewards). The Dark Dragon Blade can also be obtained in chapter 13 of Successive Play.

====Movement====
Ryu Hayabusa is able to walk or run about. He is able to clamber onto surfaces which are slightly higher than his current level. For higher surfaces, he has to jump onto them, or to catch the ledge and pull himself up.

Ryu is able to roll (a maneuver called Reverse Wind in the game). This is also an important part of his defence. Ryu gains invulnerable frames during his rolls, though he is vulnerable again when he finishes a roll. The player can keep on chaining rolls into jumps into rolls, making Ryu move much faster than running.

As a ninja, Ryu is also able to run on walls, and jump off them, allowing him to reach places where normal humans are unable to.

Ryu is also able to swim underwater in the game, though only for as long as he has oxygen in his lungs. His fighting ability in the water is limited to only a few strokes. Ryu is capable of running on water as well.

====Combat====
Ryu's offensive capability is governed by the use of two buttons which delivers a normal stroke which tends to the horizontal, and a vertical power stroke. Pressing various sequences of combinations of these two buttons will deliver different attack sequences with various weapons, provided these weapons have been upgraded to unlock those moves.

Weapons can be upgraded by paying Muramasa to do so (though there is a cap per chapter so as to introduce a gradual increase in power).

Ryu can throw shurikens on and off the ground. While no projectile weapons can be upgraded, Ryu can find a bow 'upgrade' in the form of the Strongbow later on in the story. The bows allow auto-targeting in third person mode, and allows Ryu to enter a first-person mode for manual aiming.

Ryu is also able to cast 'magic' in the form of ninpo. He can cast as many times as his 'ki' allows which is recharged with the use of Devil Elixirs, the refill station, or at the start of the chapter. Ryu must equip a ninpo scroll to cast that ninpo. Ryu can increase his ki slots with Spirit of the Devils, and increase the power of a ninpo with Jewels of the Demon Seal.

Ryu can block all attacks with the use of the block button. Very few foes can break his guard, however there are attacks (typically of bosses) which can ignore his guard. There are also attacks which chip away Ryu's health if the player blocks instead of trying to dodge them. Foes with grab attacks can still grab and hurt a blocking Ryu.

====Essence and Ultimate Techniques====
When Ryu kills a foe, it can release one of three types of essence. A blue essence can restore health, a red essence restores ki, and yellow essences function as cash in this game.  If Ryu does nothing and stands near these essences, they will be drawn into his body. Ryu can avoid this by holding the block button.

By holding down the vertical power stroke button, Ryu will absorb the essences for use as an Ultimate Technique. Releasing the vertical power stroke button will unleash the Ultimate Technique which deals heavy damage to foes. There are two levels of Ultimate Techniques. The full Ultimate Technique must be executed by absorbing a blue or red essence, or two yellow essences. A weaker version (commonly called Essence Technique amongst veteran players) can be done by absorbing a single yellow essence. Foes killed with Ultimate Technique release larger yellow essences.

===Downloadable Content===
Ninja Gaiden has downloadable content via XBox Live in the form of Hurricane Packs 1 and 2. The regular original Ninja Gaiden game is unaffected by the downloaded content. Playing new or loaded games of the original will still be the same.

To play the Hurricane Packs, one must select the new Master Ninja Tournament 2 option for Hurricane Pack 1. and Master Ninja Tournament 3 option for Hurricane Pack 2. The player must be connected to XBox Live in order to start a new game on one of the Hurricane Packs. Once a new game has been started and saved, the saved game can be reloaded and resumed.

As the Hurricane Packs are meant for Tournament play, there are no multiple difficulty levels to choose from.

====Hurricane Pack 1====
Hurricane Pack 1 was available for download via Xbox Live on August 9, 2004. Its purpose was for competitive play, and was used by Team Ninja to select participants for its second Master Ninja Tournament.

The game world and story of the Pack is the same as the original Ninja Gaiden except that some foes have been replaced with new ones. The player can only use the new features for this pack. The original Ninja Gaiden remains untouched.

One key additional feature is the Intercept technique, which some fighting game players may find similar to a fighting game-style guard cancel. If the player presses block to guard against an enemy attack just as the attack is about to hit (a shimmering effect indicates success), the player can instantly execute a normal attack or an Ultimate Technique, instead of being staggered by the enemy's attack as would be the normal case. Successful execution of the Intercept will also add 1000 karma points to the player's score.

====Hurricane Pack 2====
Hurricane Pack 1 was available for download via Xbox Live on September 27, 2004.  It was used as the actual tournament mission in which the top 3 scorers of the Hurricane Pack 1 were to play during the second Master Ninja Tournament.

The entire Pack takes place within the Palace Core and the Nether Realm. The game can be separated into 5 phases, and the player can only save and shop at the beginning or end of each phase. The game has all the applicable additional features of Hurricane Pack 1 and more (see below).

The plot of the game can be summarized as such. Rachel ventured forth into the Nether Realm and has been captured by the twin fiend goddesses, Nicchae and Ishtaros. Ryu now has to brave through the Core, enter the portal at the top, and conquer the various encounters in the Nether Realm to rescue Rachel.

===Demo===
A demo of Ninja Gaiden was available as a DVD bundled with the March 2004 edition (actually released in February) of [[Famitsu|Famitsu Xbox]]<ref> [http://xbox.ign.com/articles/492/492400p1.html] IGN: Ninja Gaiden Preview</ref>.

In the demo, the player is restricted to the game world of the retail version's chapter 1, i.e. the Ninja Fortress. However, Ryu starts off with the True Dragon Sword, the Vigoorian Flails, and the Dabilahro for melee weapons (all fully upgraded). For projectiles, Ryu has shurikens, incendiary shurikens, and the bow. Ryu is also equipped with the Art of the Inazuma for ninpo. This allows a taste of what the player can get in the retail version. The demo has no multiple difficulty levels to choose from.

===Overview===
A second edition of the game, titled '''''Ninja Gaiden Black''''', was released approximately eighteen months later, in September 2005. It is essentially a [[special edition]] of the original Xbox release of ''Ninja Gaiden''. It features new difficulty settings, much of the content from both Hurricane Packs with the exception of the Intercept parry, tweaked enemy placement in higher difficulties, new costumes, the original arcade version of ''[[Ninja Gaiden (arcade game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'', a new mode of play called Mission Mode involving scenarios not found in the core game itself, and several new in-game cutscenes. Some of the additions to the game are not readily apparent. Many are only available after being unlocked by progressing through the game.

According to interviews with [[Tomonobu Itagaki]], the Ninja Dog difficulty was added only grudgingly. Itagaki felt that the standard difficulty implemented in the game was reasonable for any casual player if they persevered through the difficult parts. However, due to a strong outcry in disagreement to the difficulty level, he instituted the Ninja Dog mode as a double-edged compromise: the mode can only be accessed through dying three successive times (similar to the Special Edition of [[Devil May Cry 3]]) within the first stage, at which point the player is asked, "Do you wish to abandon the way of the ninja?" If the player selects yes, they are given ribbons which enhance their abilities (but which can be rather demeaning to wear - pink ribbons), more notes for the player's aid (which adopt an excessively hand-holding nature), surplus powerups, and lower prices on the more essential supplies throughout the game's merchant points.

Ninja Gaiden Black is, however, more difficult than the original release on the higher difficulties. Several bosses including Spirit Doku and the Dark Disciple attack faster and more furiously, like their Hurricane Pack counterparts, plus a variety of dangerous new foes have been added to make life even harder. Furthermore, players who have previously played the normal edition of Ninja Gaiden will find that the Flying Swallow move, previously a powerful and useful technique, has been noticeably toned down and is a mere shadow of its old self, with some new enemies having moves specifically to punish usage of it against them. On Hard difficulty and above, many bosses are immune to the Flying Swallow, forcing players to adapt to a new and unfamiliar fighting style.

===Changes from Ninja Gaiden===
The following was changed from the original Ninja Gaiden:

* Higher resolution textures are now used for Ryu
* Story Mode's encounter composition varies with difficulty
* Some items' location are moved on higher difficulties of Story Mode
* Prices of items increase with game difficulty

* Scarab rewards varies with game difficulty
* AI and moveset of foes (increased aggressiveness, addition of guard breaks and grab attacks)
* Foes now block Flying Swallow at a higher rate, with some being able to counter it
* A few foes (Nightmares, Awakened Alma) now possess increased resistance to the Unlabored Flawlessness' damage
* Bosses now have minions accompanying them on higher difficulties of Story Mode
* For Story Mode, the Dark Dragon Blade is now only obtained as a scarab reward on higher difficulties
* The player is now able to manually rotate the camera's viewpoint
* The weapon Kitetsu no longer drains Ryu's health, and is upgradeable
* Guillotine Throw command has been changed
* Ryu is now able to charge up Ultimate Techniques without the need for essences
* Respawns of encounters are no longer timed nor scored
* Ultimate Techniques now score 2000 / 5000 karma points on successful hits

=== Additional Features ===

=== Removed Features ===
The following were removed from the game, compared to the original Ninja Gaiden:

* The Armlet of Tranquility (from Story Mode, but available in certain Mission Mode missions)
* The Future Ninja costume
* The 3 ported SNES [[Ninja Gaiden Trilogy]] games unlocked as bonuses in Story Mode
* Successive Play

=== Mission Mode ===
On completing Story Mode for the first time, Mission Mode is unlocked.  There are a total of 46 missions, comprising of eight sets of missions, each consisting of five separate missions.  A final set of mission, Eternal Legend, consists of 5 linked phases.  This Eternal Legend is the Hurricane Pack 2 implemented with Ninja Gaiden Black's engine and features.

The player starts off with only the first two sets of missions unlocked.  To unlock a new set of missions, the player has to complete any five available unique missions.  This means that to unlock Eternal Legend, the player has to complete 40 unique missions.

Completing a mission also unlocks the next level of difficulty for that particular mission. Difficulties in Mission Mode are Normal (default), Hard, Very Hard, and Master Ninja.  Besides the increase in difficulty, the score one can obtain for a mission on higher difficulties is greater (Master Ninja difficulty yielding the highest scores possible).

Each mission comes with its own weapons, items, and ninpos loadout.

===Features Removed===
Contrary to claims of this being the "more complete" version<ref> [http://www.gamespot.com/news/6158343.html] TGS 06: PS3 Ninja Gaiden Detailed</ref><ref> [http://www.playstatic.com/news/4] Playstatic Ninja Gaiden PS3 Bound</ref><ref> [http://ps3.ign.com/articles/782/782234p1.html] IGN: Eidos Unleashing Ninjas in Europe</ref>, the following has been removed as compared to Ninja Gaiden Black.

===Secret missions===
There is a set of missions hidden within the game's Mission Mode. The input sequence ( Up, Down, Left, Down, Right, Up, Square ) will unlock the set of missions.

===Demo===
On [[April 26]], [[2007]], a demo of the game was released on the [[PlayStation Network]] American and Japanese stores, and later on EU stores.

Like the original Ninja Gaiden's demo, the player is restricted to chapter one's game world. However in this demo, for melee weapons, the player has the True Dragon Sword, the Lunar, the Dabilahro, the Nunchakus, and the Dragon's Claw & Tiger's Fang. Like the retail game, the demo allows the player a go at higher difficulties once he completes it. The player can also play as Rachel in a mission.

To the dismay of many Ninja Gaiden veterans, the scoring system of the demo has a scoring glitch which allows players to get exorbitantly high scores on the leaderboards.

Having downloaded and played the demo would also allow the player to start off with a bonus amount of yellow essence when starting the first game on the retail version.

== Homages ==
While it has been stated that the 2004 ''Ninja Gaiden'' universe is not the same as the one in the original ''Ninja Gaiden'' (taking place in the same continuity with another [[Team Ninja]] developed game series, ''Dead or Alive'')<ref name="plot">{{cite news

, certain references make homages to the preceding games.

* Ryu's father [[Ken Hayabusa|Joe Hayabusa]] is mentioned but not seen. He plays a larger role in the first of the NES-games.
* A number of Ryu's special abilities and Ninpo-magic seen in the 2004 Ninja Gaiden are also in use in the NES-series, mostly as power ups.
* Some of the Fiends and other minor foes appear to be recreations of those seen in the NES-series. The mysterious Gamov wears an attire similar to that of the equally shadowy CIA-agents in the first Ninja Gaiden.
* The Demon, Deity of Destruction statue is reminiscent of the Dark Statue in ''[[Ninja Gaiden (NES)|Ninja Gaiden:Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword]]''.
* The theme of the elemental swords of light and darkness is reused from ''[[Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos]]'', in which the evil mastermind [[Ashtar (Ninja Gaiden)|Ashtar]] wields the titular dark sword. Likewise, the chaotic nature and architecture of the final level appear to be heavily inspired by similar scenarios in the NES series.
* The Guillotine Throw-technique is reminiscent from the Ninja Gaiden arcade game, as is the manner of departure Ryu uses in the second final cutscene, seen originally in use at the end of every stage in the arcade game.
* The [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ryu Doppleganger|Doppleganger Fiend]] of Ninja Gaiden Black is an element from NG III. The doppleganger there is a BIO-NOID, and plays a major role in NG III as he impersonated Ryu and attacked Irene. However, in NG Black, the doppleganger doesn't actually appear in the plotline but just as a boss fight, with no explanation being given for his existence. In lieu, he's a Fiend and one of Ryu's opponents. Ryu faces him several times, namely in the Hard, Very Hard and Master Ninja difficulties where he uses several of Ryu's weapons against him.
* In Ninja Gaiden Sigma, the motorcycle bikers, who are the Vigoor Special Forces riding on motorcycles, are reminiscent of the bikers from the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden.

==Dead or Alive Crossover==
Since the new Ninja Gaiden takes two years before DOA, the following derived from the fighting video game Dead or Alive, which ties the two games:
* Some of Ryu's moves such as the Izuna Drop derived from his moves in DOA.
* Ayane, a playable character from DOA, makes appearance and plays a major role. In the game, she is 14 years old and helps Ryu during missions.
* One of Ryu's victory phrase in DOA, Rin-Pyo-To Sha-Kai-Chin-Retsu-Zai-Zen, can be seen in the inventory screen and in the main menu. The nine Japanese words are in their kanji translation. Each of them are actually the 'Life of a God' items and when all nine are combined, they become the 'Lives of Thousand Gods' item, which upgrades Ryu's health bar limit.
* One of Ryu's new costumes in NG Black is a throwback from DOAU. In DOAU, Ryu's face is unmasked while in Black, the lower half of his face is covered.

==Weapons==
Several weapons can be obtained in ''Ninja Gaiden''. Some are received during key [[cutscenes]], some are simply found along the way or bought from a shopkeeper, and a select few are found only after progress in a special task. Weapons come in three general classes: melee, projectile and magic. Each has varying strengths and weaknesses. Melee and magic are usually used to directly attack, with projectile for stunning and distracting.

===Melee Weapons===
Melee weapons are the main weapon class in ''Ninja Gaiden''; most of them can be upgraded throughout the game. The melee weapons can be further subdivided by size and form.

====Swords====
Swords are balanced weapons usable in most situations.
* '''Dragon Sword''' - Ryu begins the game with the Dragon Sword. It is the basic weapon that can be used in almost all situations to good effect. This sword represents the "good" to the Dark Dragon Blade's "evil". This weapon can be upgraded 2 times and then upgraded to the "True Dragon Sword".
** '''True Dragon Sword''' - After a certain point in the game, the Dragon Sword is upgraded to the True Dragon Sword, which is more powerful and has a slightly expanded move list.
* '''Plasma Saber''' - The [[lightsaber]] of ''Ninja Gaiden''. The Plasma Saber is identical in moves and power to the Dragon Sword; it is actually just a different "look" for the Dragon Sword which is obtained after completion of the game. At the point where the Dragon Sword gets upgraded into the True Dragon Sword, it becomes the ''Plasma Saber Mk. II''. The Plasma Saber Mk. II exists in ''Black'', but not the normal Plasma Saber. In the original game it is rewarded after successive play-throughs; in ''Black'', it is rewarded after a certain amount of Scarabs are given to Muramasa, or as starting equipment in some Mission Mode missions. The upgrades are the same as for the Dragon Sword.
* '''Kitetsu''' - A long sword, distinguishable from the Dragon sword by its ability to absorb its victims' health and transfer it to the user, and also by its ability to split into two swords for some attacks. Originally, Ryu too would gradually lose his health when wielding Kitetsu, and would use the Armlet of Tranquility (which gradually restores health) to counter this effect. In ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', the Kitetsu still drains health only when attacking, but upgrading it to the highest level removes this effect, as the Armlet of Tranquility was removed in the story mode of ''Ninja Gaiden Black''. This weapon can be upgraded twice.

====Chain weapons====
Short range weapons trade off power and range for speed to allow the creation of large [[Combo (video games)|combo attacks]].
* '''[[Nunchaku]]''' - A simple wooden nunchaku. Acquired early in the game, but serves little purpose other than producing high combos for better scores once the Vigoorian Flail is acquired. It cannot be upgraded.
* '''Vigoorian Flail''' - Bears a likeness to a [[kusarigama]], but replaces the traditional iron weight with a second sickle. Essentially, it works the same as the Nunchaku, but features several additional attacks, including its own variation of the Dragon Sword's Flying Swallow attack, and deals more damage due to its bladed tips. It can be upgraded once.

====War Hammer====
Gigantic hammer/axe; it is slow but does a large amount of damage.
* '''[[War Hammer]]''' - Rachel's weapon of choice. It can be found in the monastery after defeating Alma. It can break crumbling walls, and is a suitable substitute for the Dabilahro, which is acquired later. It can be upgraded once.

====Greatswords====
Huge swords, slower but capable of attacking multiple enemies simultaneously and dealing large amounts of damage.
* '''Dabilahro''' - A greatsword. Resembles a [[Final Fantasy weapons#Swords|Buster sword]] initially, but becomes serrated when leveled up. This weapon acts as a more versatile War Hammer: it is also capable of destroying crumbling walls. This weapon can be upgraded twice.
* '''Dark Dragon Blade''' - A powerful sword that contains an essence of pure evil. Carved from the bones of a black dragon. It is sealed and under guard by the Hayabusa clan, and is a key plot element. In ''Black'', the Dark Dragon Blade does the most damage per hit, second only to the Unlabored Flawlessness in its critical state. It cannot be upgraded. It can be found in Ch. 13 on successive play in Muramasa's shop in the original, or as a reward for trading in Scarabs in Black.
* '''Wooden Sword''' - A [[Bokken|wooden training sword]]. Its move list resembles that of the Dragon Sword, but it can only strike and cannot decapitate, in addition to lacking several other moves of the Dragon Sword. This weapon can be upgraded 7 times.
** ''Unlabored Flawlessness'' - When fully upgraded, the Wooden Sword's visual appearance changes to resemble an [[eku]]. The Unlabored Flawlessness has a unique ability to it; when the player is at low health <!--10% or less, right? -->, the characters imprinted on the back of the weapon begin to glow, signifying an increase in the weapon's power. When the character is low in health, the Unlabored Flawlessness does the most damage out of any weapon in the game.

====Staff====
* '''Lunar''' - A [[Bo (weapon)|Bo staff]]/[[spear]]. Capable of fast combo attacks to multiple enemies. This weapon performs mostly sweeping attacks that knock the enemy back or into the air. This weapon is only available in the Hurricane expansion packs or in ''Black''. This weapon can be upgraded twice.

====Special====
* '''Spear Gun''' - Underwater weapon. Blocking is not possible while wielding this weapon. It can be used above water as well.

===Projectile Weapons===
* '''[[Shuriken]]''' - The weakest of Ryu's projectile weapons, Ryu has an infinite supply. When thrown during a jump it will extend the height of the jump, and if the Y button is pressed afterwards with certain weapons the character can reach places normally out of his jumping range.
* '''Incendiary Shuriken''' - Despite the label, these are technically [[kunai]] which have a small [[explosive]] on one end. When a vulnerable enemy is struck, it activates a 3 second [[fuse]]. The kunai then explodes, damaging all enemies in the blast radius, throwing small enemies back, and dealing them damage ( The Black Spider Clan Ninjas also has this as their weapon).
* '''Windmill Shuriken''' - A giant shuriken with four folding blades, it will return to its owner when thrown. It can decapitate some enemies.
* '''[[Smoke bomb]]''' - Temporarily blinds all enemies in the area, making them attack the area that Ryu was last in. Unlike other projectiles the Smoke Bomb cannot be thrown, and can only be laid on the ground. This renders it incapable of being used mid-jump. (''Ninja Gaiden Black'' Only)
* '''[[Bow (weapon)|Bow]]''' - A typical bow, the arrow shot travels in an arc and must be aimed accordingly.
* '''Strongbow''' - A [[composite bow]] made in Vigoor in medieval times. This bow fires arrows in straight lines directly in the center of the screen while aiming in first person.
** ''Explosive Arrows'' - Arrows with an explosive tip.
** ''APFSDS Cores'' - [[Tungsten]]-coated arrows that are [[armor-piercing]].

===Ninpo Techniques===
* '''The Art of Fire Wheels''' - Three fireballs revolve around Ryu and repel any medium-sized enemies that try to attack him.
* '''The Art of the Inferno''' - Ryu creates a giant fireball that he shoots at enemies.
* '''The Art of Ice Storm''' - A tornado of ice is created around Ryu.
* '''The Art of Inazuma''' - Ryu emits lightning bolts in many directions.

==Decapitation between Regions==
Despite allowing blood and gore to be splattered around in video games rated for teens and above, the ratings systems for certain countries prohibit beheadings from being depicted in them. Some of these decisions were based on public opinion over current events, and as such there are differences in the rulings between versions.

==Reception==
Ninja Gaiden received near universal critical acclaim at the time of its release. [[GameSpot]] gave it 9.4/10 saying, "This is one of the best most challenging action adventure games ever made."<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/ninjagaiden/review.html] Ninja Gaiden for Xbox Review</ref> [[IGN]] also gave it 9.4/10 and said that, "Ninja Gaiden sets a new standard for third-person action games in terms of length, depth, speed, and gore."<ref>[http://xbox.ign.com/articles/495/495186p1.html] IGN: Ninja Gaiden Review</ref> [[Gamepro]] commented on the game with lines such as, "The game simply knocks you on your ass and keeps kicking it throughout." and gave it a 5 out of 5.<ref>[http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox/games/reviews/33850.shtml] Review: Ninja Gaiden for Xbox on GamePro.com</ref>

For the sites which collects reviews from other gaming sites and calculates an average score, [[Metacritic]] rated the original 91/100<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/ninjagaiden?q=ninja%20gaiden] Ninja Gaiden Reviews</ref> and 94/100 for Ninja Gaiden Black<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/ninjagaidenblack?q=ninja%20gaiden] Ninja Gaiden Black Reviews</ref>. [[GameRankings]] rated Ninja Gaiden as 92.0%<ref>[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/561532.asp] Ninja Gaiden Reviews</ref> while Ninja Gaiden Black rates as 93.9%<ref>[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/928401.asp] Ninja Gaiden Black Reviews</ref>.

One criticism of Ninja Gaiden is with camera placement. While the default camera controls are adequate for most fights in centering the action on Ryu and providing a view of his surroundings, there are certain fights in which the camera is locked on a certain object (usually boss fights), or lose track of Ryu himself. ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' and the Hurricane Packs granted users rotational control of the camera, but this is of no help when the camera angle is locked.

Many players and game critics found the game to possess a high difficulty level and learning curve, which extended to much of the downloaded content and ''Ninja Gaiden Black''<ref> See ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' for a concise summary of fan reaction: [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/08 "A Brief Index of Difficulty"]; see also Tycho's newpost [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/03/08 comment]: "Shit ''damn'' Ninja Gaiden is hard, it's so hard that your ''friends'' will die. It's also completely great - once you've gone a few levels, just start a new game real quick and take a look at the guys you thought were bad-asses before. Those guys are ''feather pillows'' compared to the beasts and murderers you rub up against later." Tycho later [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/12/27 commented]: "When you first start playing Ninja Gaiden you might be overwhelmed with its difficulty - that was certainly true in my case. In fact, it was difficult to the degree that it was utterly demoralizing and it ended up on the shelf underneath something else so I wouldn't constantly be reminded of my deficiencies."</ref> There are however multiple difficulty settings and with the release of Ninja Gaiden Black, two more were added - Ninja Dog being the easiest, and Master Ninja being the hardest.
