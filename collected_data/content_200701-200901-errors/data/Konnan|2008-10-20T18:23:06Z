'''Charles Ashenoff''' (sometimes seen [[Hispanic]]ized as '''Carlos Ashenoff'''), (born June 6, 1964) better known by his [[ring name]], '''Konnan,''' is a semi-retired  [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[Rapping|rapper]] of [[Cuban]] descent.{{ref|BorninCuba}} 

Konnan is well-known in [[Mexico]] due to his appearances on Mexican television, particularly with the [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]], and has in the past been described as "the Mexican [[Hulk Hogan]]", reflecting his mainstream popularity.{{ref|HulkHogan}} He has also wrestled for major American [[professional wrestling promotion|promotions]] such as the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], [[World Championship Wrestling]], [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Santiago de Cuba]], [[Cuba]], Ashenoff's family relocated to the United States of America while he was a child. He had a troubled childhood in [[Miami, Florida]], during which he was [[Expulsion|expelled]] from several schools before graduating from Southwest Miami Senior High School in 1982. Ashenoff served time in [[prison]] after joining a [[Gang|street gang]].{{ref|Expelled}} After his incarceration was over, Ashenoff fled Miami due to conflicts with other drug dealers. He was given a choice of either going to jail or entering the Military. He decided to join the [[United States Navy]] and served for four years.{{ref|Navy}} While in the Navy, he trained as a [[Boxing|boxer]], becoming the Californian [[Middleweight]] [[Amateur]] Boxing Champion in 1982 and 1983, and representing the United States in fights around the world.{{ref|Boxing}} 

==Professional wrestling career==
During his residence in San Diego, Ashenoff became a [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]]{{ref|f4w}} then later a wrestler, following a meeting with [[professional wrestling promotion|wrestling promoter]] John Roberts. Comparing the masked and caped wrestlers he met to "[[superhero]]s", Ashenoff was impressed by the colorful Mexican wrestling culture.{{ref|Hero}} He subsequently traveled to [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]] where, alongside [[Psicosis]], [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.]], [[Manuel Ortiz Partida|Halloween]] and [[Leonardo Carrera|Damián 666]], he trained under the tutelage of various veteran [[Lucha libre|luchadores]].{{ref|Training}} Wearing a [[wrestling mask|mask]] and billed as El Centurión ("The Centurion"), Ashenoff debuted in the Universal Wrestling Alliance on January 6, 1987. He competed in an eight man tag team match for the sum of $200 [[Mexican peso|MXP]] ($19.13 [[United States dollar|USD]] / €16.03 [[Euro|EUR]]).{{ref|Debut}}{{ref|Pesos}}

Feeling that he was being held back, Ashenoff departed the UWA for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre]], where he was [[push (professional wrestling)|pushed]] into the main event. In the EMLL, Ashenoff adopted the ring name Konnan El Barbaro ("The Barbarian"). He lost his mask in 1991 to [[Perro Aguayo]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hair v. Mask Match|mask versus hair match]] after the referee took the side of Aguayo. After the match, a young boy—introduced as Konnan's brother—entered the ring [[tears|crying]] and handed Konnan his mask back, generating considerable bonhomie towards Konnan from the sympathetic crowd (in [[lucha libre]], losing one's mask is a major, career shaping event).{{ref|Mask}} Konnan went on to become the first ever [[CMLL World Heavyweight Championship|CMLL World Heavyweight Champion]] by winning a tournament in [[Mexico City]] on June 9, 1991. He, however, lost the title to [[Cien Caras]] in his first title defense on August 18, 1991.

===Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (1992&ndash;1996)===
In 1992, with the EMLL allegedly plagued by [[Political corruption|corruption]] and the wrestlers' [[trade union|union]] fraught with [[embezzlement]], Konnan, along with several other EMLL wrestlers, joined [[Antonio Peña]]'s upstart [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA). Shortening his ring name to simply "Konnan", he [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with Cien Caras.{{ref|AAA}} Following interference from [[Jake Roberts]], Konnan lost a two out of three falls [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retirement match]] by count-out to Caras at [[TripleMania]] on April 30, 1993 in front of 48,000 fans in Mexico City, setting the all-time attendance record for a Mexican wrestling event.{{ref|TripleMania}} Konnan did not comply with the stipulations of the match and returned to defeat Roberts in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hair v. Mask Match|hair versus hair match]] at TripleMania II on May 27, 1994 in Tijuana.{{ref|Hair}}

Later in 1994, Konnan began a storyline where he betrayed his [[tag team]] partner, Perro Aguayo, and formed a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|alliance]] known as [[Los Gringos Locos]] with [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Art Barr]] and [[Louie Spicolli|Madonna's Boyfriend]]. Aguayo gained his revenge on Konnan by defeating him in the first, and, to date, only, AAA [[pay-per-view]], "[[AAA When Worlds Collide|When Worlds Collide]]", in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] on November 6, 1994. He eventually became the AAA [[List of professional wrestling slang#B|booker]]. Konnan defeated Killer on February 2, 1996 in [[Queretaro]] to become the first ever AAA Heavyweight Champion.{{ref|Champion}} He vacated the title after leaving AAA in October 1996 to form his own promotion, ''Promo Azteca'', and the title remained inactive until 2004. Konnan's Mexican wrestling career was hampered in the late-1990s by his American wrestling commitments, and ''Promo Azteca'' closed in 1998. He made a return to the Mexican wrestling circuit in the 2000s after a six year absence, selling-out arenas in Mexico City and [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]].{{ref|Sellout}}

===World Wrestling Federation (1992&ndash;1993)===
After he was approached by talent scout [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], Konnan spent eight months in the American [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] as Max Moon in 1992. The Moon [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|character]], created by Konnan,{{ref|Moon1}} was that of a [[cyborg]] who wore an outfit (purchased by the WWF at the cost of [[United States dollar|$]]1,300) bedecked with [[Electrical network|circuitry]] and a [[Explosive material|pyrotechnic]] [[gun]] during his approach to the ring. Konnan was given many ring names, including his own name, the Comet Kid, Maximillion Moves, El Electrico, and eventually Max Moon.His character hailed from "The Future" or "Outer Space", his entrance music was a techno song, and his finishing move was the flying bodypress (a somersault onto his opponent with them on his shoulders). His attire was blue leather, silver foam tubing and a mask. On his way to the ring, he shot sparkles into the crowd.

Debuting in the WWF on September 1, 1992 in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]] under the name the Comet Kid, he pinned [[Barry Horowitz]]. After three televised matches, Konnan left the WWF following a disagreement with WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]]. Konnan believed that he was being [[Racism|discriminated]] against and resented McMahon's refusal to give him a guaranteed contract. The Max Moon gimmick was subsequently given to [[Tom Boric|Paul Diamond]], before being abandoned.{{ref|Moon2}} Konnan's last appearance as Max Moon is presumed to be on December 12, 1992 in Los Angeles when he pinned Repo Man. Max Moon's next appearance at a WWF show was against [[Shawn Michaels]] in the first ever ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' episode on January 11, 1993, then presumably played by Paul Diamond.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)===
Konnan once again attempted to expand his activities out of Mexico in the mid-1990s. After meeting [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) booker [[Paul Heyman]] while on a wrestling tour of [[Singapore]], Konnan joined ECW in 1995, and feuded with [[Jim Fullington|The Sandman]]. He appeared at [[ECW November to Remember|November To Remember]] on November 18, 1995, [[squash (professional wrestling)|squashing]] [[Jason Knight|Jason]], and wrestled at an event co-promoted by ECW and the AAA in [[Chicago, Illinois]].{{ref|ECW}}

===World Championship Wrestling (1990&ndash;2001)===
Konnan's first appearances with [[World Championship Wrestling]]  (WCW) came after WCW employee Jim Barnett offered him a tryout match with [[Bobby Eaton]]. The match was well-received by WCW management, and Konnan was [[booking (professional wrestling)|booked]] at [[Starrcade (1990)|Starrcade]] on December 16, 1990. Teaming with his trainer and mentor, [[Rey Misterio, Sr.]], Konnan entered the [[Pat O'Connor Memorial International Cup Tag Team Tournament]], and they defeated [[Norman Smiley]] and [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]] in the quarter-finals, but lost to eventual winners, the [[Steiner Brothers]] ([[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner|Scott]]) in the semi-finals. 

Feeling that he had accomplished all that he could in Mexico and desiring to expand his popularity north of the border, Konnan returned to WCW on a full-time basis in January 1996.{{ref|USA}} As a WCW employee, he was largely responsible for the hiring of several prominent Mexican wrestlers by WCW, including [[Rey Misterio, Jr.]], [[Psicosis]], [[Juventud Guerrera]] and [[La Parka]] all of whom were wrestling in Konnan's newly formed Promo Azteca in Mexico. Konnan defeated [[George Gray (wrestler)|The One Man Gang]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] in [[Canton, Ohio]] on the January 28, 1996 episode of ''[[WCW Pro]]''. During his reign, he continued to defend his IWAS and AAA Heavyweight Championships in Mexico (these championships were billed as a "Mexican Heavyweight Title" wherever Konnan wore one or the other to a WCW ring). He lost the United States Title to [[Ric Flair]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] on July 7, 1996 at [[Bash at the Beach (1996)|Bash At The Beach]] following interference from Flair's [[manager (professional wrestling)|valets]], [[Miss Elizabeth]] and [[Nancy Daus|Woman]].{{ref|US}} Several months after losing the United States Championship, Konnan became a villain and joined the [[Dungeon of Doom]]. 

Konnan joined the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] on July 14, 1997. During his first stint in the nWo, Konnan feuded with the [[Luchadores]] who he had brought to WCW. During this storyline, he wrestled in a Mexican Death Match at [[Hog Wild#1997|Hog Wild]] against Rey Mysterio, Jr. and a match against [[Juventud Guerrera]] later that year at [[Uncensored#1997|Uncensored]]. When the nWo divided into two rivals factions on the May 4, 1998 episode of ''Nitro'', Konnan sided with the nWo Wolfpac, led by [[Kevin Nash]]. The Wolfpac feuded with nWo Hollywood, led by [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hogan]], and became [[tweener (professional wrestling)|tweeners]]. Konnan developed an increasingly [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] based gimmick and was nicknamed K-Dawg. On the November 30, 1998 episode of ''Nitro'', Konnan defeated [[Chris Jericho]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship]]. His reign lasted until December 28, 1998, when he lost to nWo Hollywood member Scott Steiner on Nitro in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] following interference from [[Buff Bagwell]].{{ref|TV}} When the two halves of the nWo reunited in January 1999, Konnan was thrown out of the nWo and attacked. As a result, he became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] and teamed with Rey Misterio, Jr. to fight the nWo. After feuding with nWo member [[Lex Luger]], Konnan and Mysterio, Jr. were defeated by [[The Outsiders (nWo)|The Outsiders]] at [[SuperBrawl#SuperBrawl IX|SuperBrawl IX]], with The Outsiders removing Mysterio's mask in the process. Konnan later criticized WCW for not respecting Mexican wrestling culture by writing storylines that saw several Mexican wrestlers unceremoniously unmasked. He compared asking a luchadore to remove their mask to "going to Japan and telling the Japanese they have to eat with a [[fork]] instead of [[chopsticks]]."{{ref|Unmasked}}

Konnan spent several months feuding with [[Glenn Gilberti|Disco Inferno]] before he began a rivalry with [[Lane Huffman|Stevie Ray]]. He and Mysterio formed an alliance with [[Master P]] and his "No Limit Soldiers" and fought with the [[West Texas Rednecks]]. After Master P left WCW, Konnan formed a stable known as the [[Filthy Animals]]. He and Mysterio, representing the Filthy Animals, defeated [[Harlem Heat]] ([[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and Stevie Ray) for the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]]s on October 18, 1999 with the assistance of [[Billy Kidman]] and [[Eddie Guerrero]]. They were scheduled to defend the titles against Harlem Heat in the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] on October 24, 1999 at [[Halloween Havoc#1999|Halloween Havoc]], but on the night of the event Misterio was announced as being injured. The titles were then contested in a three way tag match pitting Konnan and Billy Kidman, representing the Filthy Animals, against Harlem Heat and the [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] ([[William DeMott|Hugh Morrus]] and [[Brian Knobbs]]). Harlem Heat regained the titles after Stevie Ray pinned Morrus. Konnan and Kidman defeated Harlem Heat for the titles the next night on ''Nitro'', but lost to [[Harris Brothers|Creative Control]] ([[Harris Brothers|Patrick]] and [[Harris Brothers|Gerald]]) on November 22, 1999.{{ref|Tag}}

Konnan was inactive throughout early 2000, as he was suspended for three months by Bill Busch after requesting his release from WCW, unhappy with the way he was being used.{{ref|Suspended}} It was rumored that he might jump to the WWF with [[The Radicalz]], but he never did. Shortly after returning from suspension and reforming the Filthy Animals, Konnan was sidelined once again, this time with a legitimately torn [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] muscle, damaged when [[Mark Hildreth|Van Hammer]] threw Juventud Guerrera at him during a match and Guerrera's elbow connected with Konnan's upper arm as he attempted to catch him.{{ref|Arm}} Throughout 2000, the Filthy Animals feuded with other stables, including the [[Misfits In Action]], the [[Natural Born Thrillers]] and [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]]. At [[WCW Greed|Greed]] on March 18, 2001, [[Lance Storm]] and [[Mike Awesome]] (representing Team Canada) defeated Hugh Morrus and Konnan in one of his last appearances with the promotion before it was sold to the WWF in March 2001.

Following the sale of WCW, Konnan toured Australia and Europe throughout 2001 with the newly-formed [[World Wrestling All-Stars]] promotion. In addition to wrestling, Konnan acted as a [[color commentator]]. He also studied [[criminology]] during a period in which he briefly considered working alongside his father as a [[private investigator]].{{ref|Criminology}}

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002&ndash;2007)===
Konnan appeared on the inaugural [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) [[pay-per-view]] on June 19, 2002 in the [[Von Braun Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. He entered the [[Professional wrestling match types#Gauntlet match (TNA)|Gauntlet for the Gold match]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] but was [[chokeslam]]med and subsequently eliminated by [[Jerry Tuite|Malice]]. He returned to TNA on February 12, 2003 and formed a heel stable, the Authentic Luchadores, with fellow Latino wrestlers Juventud Guerrera, [[Francisco Pantoja Islas|Super Crazy]] and the [[The S.A.T.|Spanish Announce Team]]. The stable feuded with [[Jerry Lynn]] until April 2, 2003, when Lynn claimed that he had been heavily influenced by lucha libre and that he respected his Mexican opponents, thus earning the friendship of Konnan.{{ref|TNA}}

====The 3Live Kru====
{{main|3Live Kru}}
In May and June 2003, Konnan began teaming with [[Brian Gerard James|B.G. James]] and [[Ron Killings]], and in July 2003 the trio formed a face stable known as the 3Live Kru. The Kru first wrestled as a unit on August 13, 2003, defeating [[The New Church]] ([[Nick Cvjetkovich|Sinn]], [[David Heath (wrestler)|Vampire Warrior]] and [[Devon Storm]]). On November 26, 2003, the Kru defeated [[Pat Kenney|Simon Diamond]], [[Joseph Dorgan|Johnny Swinger]] and [[Glenn Gilberti]] in a six man tag team match with the vacant [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]]s on the line. The NWA World Tag Title was thus held by all three members of the Kru, until January 28, 2004, when they were defeated by [[Kevin Northcutt]] and [[Joe Hitchen|Legend]] in Nashville.{{ref|NWATag1}} After several abortive attempts to regain the tag titles, the Kru began supporting Ron Killings's bid to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. On June 9, 2004, NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Jeff Jarrett]] took part in a "3Live Kru Challenge" which saw him face Konnan, James and Killings in three subsequent matches. Jarrett defeated Konnan in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Texas Bullrope match|strap match]] and James in a "[[trailer park trash]] match" ([[hardcore wrestling|hardcore]] match), but lost to Killings in a "[[Ghetto]] Justice match". The Kru later feuded with Jarrett's [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], [[The Elite Guard]] ([[Chad Collyer]], [[Shawn Hernandez|Hotstuff Hernandez]] and [[Onyx (disambiguation)|Onyx]]). On July 14, 2004, the 3Live Kru, [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Larry Zbyszko]] defeated Jarrett, [[Ken Shamrock]] and the Elite Guard in a ten man tag team match. The Kru began feuding with [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]] in August 2004, and at the inaugural three hour TNA pay-per-view, [[Victory Road (2004)|Victory Road]] on November 7, 2004, Konnan and James defeated Team Canada members [[Bobby Roode]] and [[Eric Young (wrestler)|"Showtime" Eric Young]] for the NWA World Tag Team Championships. Their reign lasted one month, with Team Canada regaining the titles in Orlando on December 5, 2004 at [[Turning Point (2004)|Turning Point]] with the help of the injured [[Johnny Devine]].{{ref|NWATag2}}

Throughout early-2005, the Kru feuded with [[Matt Bentley|Michael Shane]] and [[Frankie Kazarian|Kazarian]], Team Canada and [[The Naturals]]. Dissension arose after James's former tag team partner from the WWF, [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]], joined TNA as "The New Age Outlaw" and began trying to convince James to reform their highly-successful tag team, the [[New Age Outlaws]]. Konnan and Killings feuded with The Outlaw and [[Monty Brown|"The Alpha Male" Monty Brown]], with James's loyalties divided. Brown and The Outlaw, who had by now renamed himself "Kip James" as a psychological ploy, defeated Konnan and Killings at [[TNA No Surrender#2005|No Surrender]] on July 17, 2005, with James declining to help either team. Konnan and Killings became increasingly frustrated, at one point referring to themselves as the "2Live Kru". The two teams faced one another in a No Surrender rematch on August 14, 2005 at [[TNA Sacrifice#2005|Sacrifice]], with James appointed guest referee by [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling|Director of Authority]] Larry Zbyszko, and James reaffirmed his loyalty to the Kru by attacking Kip, enabling Konnan to pin him and win the match. The Kru, apparently undivided, celebrated together following the match.{{ref|Kru}}

Over the following weeks, Kip James began assisting the 3Live Kru, and on October 23, 2005 at [[Bound for Glory (2005)|Bound for Glory]], he saved Konnan from a beating at the hands of Team Canada. On the November 26 episode of ''Impact!'', B.G. James brought Kip James and the 3Live Kru to ringside, then asked Killings and Konnan whether James could join the stable. Following a heated argument between the still skeptical Konnan and B.G., both Killings and Konnan gave their assent, and the "'4Live Kru" was born. At [[TNA Turning Point#2005|Turning Point]] the 4Live Kru faced Team Canada in an eight man tag match. In the course of the match, Konnan struck Kip James with a chair, then instructed Bobby Roode to pin James. Following the match, B.G. James demanded an explanation, only to have Konnan hit him as well. Killings then angrily asked Konnan if he intended to hit him also, but Konnan dropped the chair and attempted to hug Killings. The incident appeared to spell the end of the short lived 4Live Kru, as well as ending the legacy of the tight bond of the 3Live Kru.

====The Latin American Exchange====
{{main|Latin American Exchange}}
On the December 31, 2005, episode of ''Impact!'', Konnan told B.G.'s father, [[Bob Armstrong]], that he was a "hothead" and invited Armstrong to accompany him backstage for an apology. However, instead of apologizing, Konnan led Armstrong into an ambush at the hands of [[Germán Figueroa|Apolo]] and the debuting [[Nelson Erazo|Homicide]]. The trio, later identified as the Latin American Exchange, then instructed an [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] Armstrong to tell B.G. and Kip to "take care of their own business". At [[TNA Final Resolution#2006|Final Resolution]] on January 15, 2006, Konnan and Homicide defeated [[The Naturals]]. After Apolo was released by TNA, he was replaced by [[Ricky Vega|Machete]], who was in turn evicted from the LAX by Konnan and Homicide. In subsequent weeks, Konnan began feuding with Bob Armstrong. On the April 8, 2006 episode of ''Impact!'', Konnan faced Armstrong in a "Arm Wrestling Challenge"; the contest ended in a no-contest after LAX member [[Shawn Hernandez|Hernandez]] attacked Armstrong. At [[Lockdown (2006)|Lockdown]] on April 23, 2006, Konnan was decisively defeated by Armstrong in an arm wrestling contest held within the confines of a steel cage; following the bout, each member of the LAX received ten [[Whip|lashes]] from the [[New Age Outlaws|James Gang]].

In May 2006, Konnan became the ''Impact!'' Spanish [[color commentator]]. In the same month, he and the LAX began a storyline that saw them refuse to wrestle (as well as himself and [[Jack Melendez|Moody Jack]] refusing to commentate), claiming that [[Latino]]s were discriminated against within TNA. After the LAX were forced to resume wrestling by [[Jim Cornette]], they began feuding with [[A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels]], with whom Homicide and Hernandez traded the NWA World Tag Team Championship back and forth. The LAX then feuded with [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] and [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]], losing the NWA World Tag Team Championship to Team 3D at [[Lockdown (2007)|Lockdown]].

In early 2007, Konnan underwent [[hip replacement]] surgery. His appearances in TNA from then on saw him frequently [[wheelchair]] bound. In June, Konnan left TNA for AAA in Mexico.{{ref|Quit}}. He successfully underwent kidney transplant surgery in July 2007. In March 2008, Konnan sued TNA for racism and discrimination, amongst other things. Konnan alleged that while the company said that they would help pay for his hip replacement surgery, they did not. To add leverage to the suit, Konnan claimed that TNA helped pay for [[Scott Steiner]]'s operation, but did not pay for [[Ron Killings]]'s surgery from around the same time.{{ref|Lawsuit}}
