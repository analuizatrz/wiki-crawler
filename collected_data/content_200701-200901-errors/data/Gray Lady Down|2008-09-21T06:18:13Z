'''''Gray Lady Down''''' is a [[1978]] [[disaster film]] by [[Universal Studios]] which starred [[Charlton Heston]], [[David Carradine]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Ronny Cox]], and featured the first film role for a young [[Christopher Reeve]].

==Plot==
An aging, respected commander (Charlton Heston) is on his final [[submarine]] tour before his retirement. Surfaced and returning to port, the submarine, USS <i>Neptune</i> (possibly a [[Skate class submarine|''Skate''-class]] or ''Nautilus''-class [[attack submarine]]) is struck by a giant freighter in heavy fog, and sinks to a depth of 1,450 feet on canyon ledge above the ocean floor. A [[US Navy]] rescue force commanded by Stacy Keach arrives on scene, but ''Neptune'' is perched at an angle that does not allow the Navy's [[Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle]] ([[DSRV]]) rescue submarine to complete its work.

A small experimental submersible, ''Snark'', is brought in to assist with the rescue. ''Snark'' is very capable, but run by a [[nonconformist]] navy misfit (David Carradine). The tiny submersible is the only hope for a rescue.

Ronny Cox plays Neptune's executive officer, scheduled to take over command from Charlton Heston, Ned Beatty plays the ''Snark''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s second crewman, and Christopher Reeve appears in his first film role in a bit part for the sharp-eyed viewer.

The movie re-used submarine special-effect footage from [[Ice Station Zebra (film)|''Ice Station Zebra'']], as well as the large-scale submarine model, with that film's submarine (''Tigerfish'') appearing as the USS ''Neptune''.

The movie is adapted from the novel ''Event 1000'' by David Lavallee (1971).
