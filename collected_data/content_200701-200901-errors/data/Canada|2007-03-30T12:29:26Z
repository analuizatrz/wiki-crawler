'''Canada''' is the world's [[List of countries by area|second-largest]] country, occupying most of northern [[North America]]. Extending from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]], Canada shares land borders with the [[United States]] to the northwest and south.

Inhabited first by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]], Canada was founded as a union of [[British overseas territories|British colonies]] (some of which were formerly [[French colonial empires|French colonies]]). Canada gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in an incremental process that [[Constitution Act, 1867|began in 1867]] and [[Canada Act 1982|ended in 1982]]; it remains a [[Commonwealth Realm]].

Canada is a [[federal constitutional monarchy]] with [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. Comprising ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and three [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories of Canada|territories]], Canada is a [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] country, with both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[French in Canada|French]] as [[official language]]s at the federal level. A technologically advanced and industrialized nation, Canada maintains a diversified [[Economy of Canada|economy]] that is heavily reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade — particularly with the United States, with which Canada has had a [[Canada-United States relations|long and complex relationship]].

==Origin and history of the name==
{{main|Canada's name}}<!--Please see the talk page before editing or reverting this to specify which (of several) languages produced the word Canada. There are differences of opinion, which may be best discussed at the main article Canada's name-->
The name ''Canada'' comes from a word in the language of the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]] meaning "village" or "settlement."  In [[1535]], inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] towards the village of [[Stadacona]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Bruce G. |last = Trigger | coauthors =  Pendergast, James F. | year = 1978 |chapter=Saint-Lawrence Iroquoians | title = Handbook of North American Indians Volume 15 | location= Washington |publisher= Smithsonian Institution | pages= pp. 357-361 | id = OCLC 58762737}}</ref> Cartier used the word 'Canada' to refer to not only that village, but the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]], Chief at Stadacona. By 1545, European books and maps began referring to this region as Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12356/12356-h/12356-h.htm | title = Relation originale de Jacques Cartier | publisher = Tross (1863 edition) | author = Jacques Cartier | date = 1545 | accessdate = 2007-02-23}}</ref>

The French colony of [[Canada, New France|Canada]] referred to the part of [[New France]] along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]]. Later, it was split into two British colonies, called [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] until their union as the British [[Province of Canada]] in 1841. Upon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the name Canada was officially adopted for the new [[dominion]], which was referred to as the ''Dominion of Canada'' until the 1950s. As Canada increasingly acquired political authority and autonomy from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the federal government increasingly simply used ''Canada'' on state documents and treaties. The [[Canada Act 1982]] refers only to "Canada" and, as such, it is currently the only legal (and bilingual) name. This was reflected again in 1982 with the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Canada|Timeline of Canadian history}}

Aboriginal tradition holds that the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|First Peoples]] inhabited parts of Canada since the dawn of time. Archaeological studies support a human presence in northern [[Yukon]] to 26,500 years ago, and in southern [[Ontario]] to 9,500 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cinq-Mars | first = J. | year = 2001 | title = On the significance of modified mammoth bones from eastern Beringia | journal = The World of Elephants - International Congress, Rome | url = http://www.cq.rm.cnr.it/elephants2001/pdf/424_428.pdf | accessdate = 2006-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Wright, J.V |publisher= Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation |url=http://www.civilization.ca/archeo/hnpc/npvol04e.html |title=A History of the Native People of Canada: Early and Middle Archaic Complexes|date=[[2001-09-27]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> Europeans first arrived when the [[Vikings]] settled briefly at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] circa AD 1000. 

[[Image:Fer - Le Canada, ou Nouvelle France, la Floride, la Virginie, Pensilvanie, Caroline.png|thumb|left|Map of [[New France]] showing location of [[First Nations]] - 1702]]The next Europeans to explore Canada's Atlantic coast included [[John Cabot]] in 1497 for [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534  for [[France]]. French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] in 1605 and [[Quebec City]] in 1608. Among [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] of [[New France]], ''[[Canadiens]]'' extensively settled the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley, [[Acadians]] settled the present-day [[Maritimes]], while [[Coureurs de bois|French fur traders]] and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Catholic missionaries]] explored  the [[Great Lakes]], [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Mississippi River#Watershed|Mississippi watershed]] to [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The [[French and Iroquois Wars]] broke out over control of the [[fur trade]].

The [[Kingdom of England|English]] established fishing outposts in [[Newfoundland]] around 1610 and [[British colonization of the Americas|colonized]] the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south. A series of four [[French and Indian Wars|Intercolonial Wars]] erupted between 1689 and 1763. Mainland [[Nova Scotia]] came under British rule with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713); the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ceded all of [[New France]] to [[British Empire|Britain]] following the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].

[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' on the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Plains of Abraham]] at [[Quebec City|Quebec]] in 1759.]] 
The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Royal Proclamation (1763)]] carved the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] out of [[New France]] and annexed [[Cape Breton Island]] to [[Nova Scotia]]. It also restricted the language and religious rights of [[French Canadians]]. In 1769, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]) became a separate colony. To avert conflict in Quebec, the [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 expanded Quebec's territory to the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Ohio Valley]], and re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law in Quebec; it angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, helping to fuel the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | author= |publisher= |title= Wars on Our Soil, earliest times to 1885 |accessdate=2006-08-21 |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/gallery1/revolution2_e.html}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] recognized American independence and ceded territories south of the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Unites States]]. Approximately 50,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled the [[United States]] to Canada.<ref name="moore">{{cite book |first= Christopher |last=Moore |year=1994 |title=The Loyalist: Revolution Exile Settlement |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |location= Toronto |id=ISBN 0-7710-6093-9}}</ref> [[New Brunswick]] was split from [[Nova Scotia]] to recognize Loyalist settlements in the [[Maritimes]].  To accommodate English-speaking Loyalists in [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]] , the [[Constitutional Act of 1791 ]] divided the province into French-speaking [[Lower Canada]] and English-speaking [[Upper Canada]], granting each their own elected Legislative Assembly. 

[[Image:Canada upper lower map.PNG|thumb|left|The Canadas 1791, upper (orange) and lower (green)]]
Canada was a major front in the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and British Empire. Its defence contributed to a sense of unity among British North Americans. Large-scale immigration to Canada began in 1815 from Britain and Ireland. The [[timber industry]] would also surpass the [[fur trade]] in importance in the early 1800s. 

The desire for [[Responsible Government]] resulted in the aborted [[Rebellions of 1837]]. As a result, [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|The Durham Report(1839)]] recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into British culture.<ref name="ce_durhamreport">{{cite web |author=David Mills |publisher= Historica Foundation of Canada |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002473 |title=Durham Report |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> The [[Act of Union (1840)]] merged [[The Canadas]]  into a [[United Province of Canada]]. French and English Canadians would work together in the Assembly to reinstate French rights. They later established [[Responsible government#British North America|responsible government]] in 1849, as would all British North American colonies. 

The signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]] by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], extending the border westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], and paving the way for British colonies on [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island (1849)]] and in [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia (1858)]]. Canada launched a series of western exploratory expeditions to claim [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[Arctic]] region. The Canadian population grew rapidly because of high birth rates; British immigration was offset by emigration to the United States, especially by French Canadians moving to [[New England]].

===Confederation===
[[Image:Canada provinces evolution.gif|thumb|left|Animated map of evolution of the borders and names of Canada's provinces and territories.]]
Following several constitutional conferences, the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]] brought about [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] creating "one dominion under the name of [[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Canada]]" on July 1, 1867 with four provinces: [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Farthing |first= John |title= Freedom Wears a Crown |location= Toronto |publisher=Kingswood House |date=1957 |id = ASIN B0007JC4G2}}</ref>  Canada assumed control of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to form the [[Northwest Territories]]. [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] grievances ignited the [[Red River Rebellion]] and the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|united]] in 1866) and the colony of [[Prince Edward Island]] joined Confederation in 1871 and 1873, respectively. [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John A. MacDonald]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] established a [[National Policy]] of [[tarrifs]] to protect nascent Canadian manufacturing industries. To open the West, the government sponsored construction of three trans-continental railways  (most notably the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), opened the prairies to settlement with the [[Dominion Lands Act]], and established the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North West Mounted Police]] to assert it's authority over this territory. Under [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfrid Laurier]], continental European immigrants settled the prairies, and [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] became provinces in 1905.

[[Image:Canadian tank and soldiers Vimy 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian soldiers advance behind a tank at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917.]]
Canada automatically entered the [[First World War]] in 1914 with Britain's declaration of war, sending volunteers to the Western Front to fight as a national contingent. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]  erupted when [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] brought in compulsory military service over the objection of French-speaking Quebecers.  In 1919, Canada joined the [[League of Nations]] independently of Britain; in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] affirmed Canada's independence. 

The [[Great Depression of 1929]] brought economic hardship to all of Canada. In response, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) in Alberta and Saskatchewan presaged a welfare state as pioneered by [[Tommy Douglas]] in the 1940s and 1950s. Liberal Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] secured Parliament’s approval for [[Military history of Canada during World War II|entry into the Second World War]] in September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland. The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939.<ref name="stacey">{{cite book | last = Stacey |first= C.P.| authorlink =C.P.

In 1949, [[Newfoundland]] joined Confederation as Canada's 10th province. Post-war prosperity and economic expansion ignited a [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] and attracted immigration from war-ravaged European countries, changing the country's demographics.<ref>{{cite web | author= Harold Troper |publisher= Ontario Institute for Studies in Education |url=http://ceris.metropolis.net/Virtual%20Library/Demographics/troper1/troper1.html |title=History of Immigration to Toronto Since the Second World War: From Toronto 'the Good' to Toronto 'the World in a City' |date=2000-03 |accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> Canada asserted an independent foreign policy, acting as a neutral broker to diffuse the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 and deploying Canadian soldiers as part of the first [[peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeeping force]].

[[Quebec]] underwent profound social and economic changes during the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s. [[Québécois]] [[Quebec nationalism|nationalists]] began pressing for greater provincial autonomy. The [[Quebec sovereignty movement|separatist]] [[Parti Québécois]] first came to power in 1976. A [[referendum]] on [[sovereignty-association]] in [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] was rejected by a solid majority of the population, and a second referendum in [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]] was rejected by a slimmer margin of just 50.6% to 49.4%.<ref name="dickinson">{{cite book |first= John Alexander |last=Dickinson |coauthors=Young, Brian |year=2003 |title=A Short History of Quebec |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |edition=3rd edition |location= Montreal |id=ISBN 0-7735-2450-9}}</ref> In 1997, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled [[Reference re Secession of Quebec|unilateral secession by a province to be unconstitutional]]; Quebec's sovereignty movement has continued nonetheless.<ref name="dickinson" /> 

[[Image:Charter.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], 1982]]
Under successive [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] governments of [[Lester B. Pearson]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]], a new [[Canadian nationalism]] emerged. Canada adopted its current [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf Flag]] in 1965. In response to a more assertive [[francophone|French-speaking]] [[Quebec]], the federal government became [[Bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] with the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] of 1969.  Non-discriminatory [[Immigration to Canada|Immigration Acts]] were introduced in 1967 and 1976, and official  [[Multiculturalism#Origins in Canada|multiculturalism]] in 1971; waves of non-European immigration have changed the face fo the country. [[Social democratic]] programs such as [[Medicare (Canada)|Universal Health Care]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], [[Canada Student Loans]] were initiated in the 1960s and consolidated in the 1970s; provincial governments, particularly Quebec, fought these as incursions into their jurisdictions. Finally, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] pushed through the [[patriation]] of the constitution from Britain, enshrining a [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] based on [[individual rights]] in the [[Constitution Act of 1982]].

Economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The [[Canada-United States Automotive Agreement]] (or Auto Pact) in [[1965]] and the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] of [[1987]] were defining moments in integrating the two economies. [[Canadian nationalism|Canadian nationalists]] continued to worry about their cultural autonomy as American television shows, movies and corporations became omnipresent.<ref name="granatstein">{{cite book |first= J.L. |last=Granatstein |year=1997 |title=Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism |publisher=HarperCollins |location= Toronto |id=ISBN 0-00-638541-9}}</ref> However, Canadians take special pride in their [[Health care in Canada|system of universal health care]] and their commitment to multiculturalism.<ref name="bickerton">{{cite book |author=Bickerton, James & Gagnon, Alain-G & Gagnon, Alain (Eds). |title=Canadian Politics |publisher=Broadview Press |edition=4th edition |location=Orchard Park, NY |id=ISBN 1-55111-595-6 |year=2004}}</ref>

==Government==
{{main|Government of Canada|Politics of Canada|Monarchy in Canada}}
[[Image:Canada Parliament2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]].]]

Canada is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], Queen of Canada as head of state,<ref>{{cite web |author=Heritage Canada |authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage |publisher= Heritage Canada |url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/royalvisit2005/53_e.cfm |title=The Queen and Canada: 53 Years of Growing Together|date=[[2005-04-21]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Governor General of Canada |authorlink=Governor General of Canada |publisher= Governor General of Canada|url=http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/index_e.asp |title=Role and Responsibilities of the Governor General|date=[[2005-12-06]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> and a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[federation|federal system]] of [[Parliament|parliamentary government]] and strong democratic traditions. 

[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] governs the legal framework of the country and consists of written text and unwritten traditions and conventions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Department of Justice |publisher= Department of Justice, Canada |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/index.html |title=Constitution Acts 1867 to 1982|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> The basic framework of the Canadian constitution is contained in the British North America Act 1867, renamed the Constitution Act 1867 in 1982. It states that Canada has a constitution "similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom" and divides the powers between the federal and provincial governments. The Constitution includes the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantees basic rights and freedoms for Canadians that, generally, cannot be overridden by legislation of any level of government in Canada. It contains, however, a "[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]", which allows the federal parliament and the provincial legislatures the power to override some other sections of the Charter temporarily, for a period of five years.

The position of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], Canada's [[head of government]], belongs to the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|current leader]] of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The Prime Minister and their Cabinet are formally appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] (who is the Monarch's representative in Canada). However, the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet, and by convention, the Governor General respects the Prime Minister's choices. The [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]], and become Ministers of the Crown. The Prime Minister exercises vast political power, especially in the appointment of other officials within the government and [[civil service]]. [[Michaëlle Jean]] has served as Governor General since [[September 25]], [[2005]], and [[Stephen Harper]], leader of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], has served as Prime Minister since [[February 6]], [[2006]].

The [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] is made up of the Queen and two houses: an elected House of Commons and an appointed [[Canadian Senate|Senate]]. Each member in the House of Commons is elected by [[plurality electoral system|simple plurality]] in a [[electoral district (Canada)|"riding" or electoral district]]; general elections are called by the Governor General when the Prime Minister so advises. While there is no minimum term for a Parliament, a new election must be called within five years of the last general election. Members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, are chosen by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the Governor General, and serve until age 75.

Canada's four major political parties are the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], [[Liberal Party of Canada]], [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP), and the [[Bloc Québécois]]. The current government is formed by the Conservative Party of Canada. While the [[Green Party of Canada]] and other smaller parties do not have current representation in Parliament, the list of [[List of political parties in Canada#Historical parties that have won seats in Parliament|historical parties with elected representation]] is substantial.

==Law==
{{main|Law of Canada}}
[[Image:Supreme Court of Canada.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill.]]

Canada's [[judiciary]] plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down laws that violate the Constitution.  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is the highest court and final arbiter and is led by the Right Honourable Madam Chief Justice [[Beverley McLachlin]], P.C. Its nine members are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] on the advice of the Prime Minister. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice, after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies. The federal cabinet appoints justices to superior courts at the provincial and territorial levels. Judicial posts at the lower provincial and territorial levels are filled by their respective governments (see [[Court system of Canada]] for more detail).

[[Common law]] prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] predominates. [[Criminal law in Canada|Criminal law]] is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is a provincial responsibility, but in rural areas of all provinces but Ontario and Quebec policing is contracted to the federal [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP).

Canada has a close [[U.S.-Canada relations|relationship with the United States]], sharing the world's longest undefended border, co-operating on some military campaigns and exercises, and being each other's largest trading partners. Canada also shares history and long relationships with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]], the two former imperial powers most influential in its founding. These relations extend to other former-members of the British and French empires, through Canada's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[La Francophonie]].

Canada joined the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in Windsor in June 2000, and the third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April 2001. Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum (APEC).

Over the past sixty years, Canada has been an advocate for [[multilateralism]], making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.<ref name="canada_policy">

In addition to major participation in the [[Second Boer War]], the [[First World War]], the [[Second World War]], and the [[Korean War]], Canada has maintained forces in international missions under the United Nations and NATO since 1950, including peacekeeping missions, various missions in the former [[Yugoslavia]], and support to coalition forces in the [[First Gulf War]]. Since 2001, Canada has had troops deployed in [[Afghanistan]] as part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. stabilization force]] and the UN-authorized, NATO-commanded [[International Security Assistance Force]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Provinces and territories of Canada}}
[[Image:Map_Canada_political-geo.png|thumb|right|A geopolitical map of Canada, exhibiting its [[Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada|ten provinces and three territories]].]]

Canada is composed of ten provinces and three territories. The provinces are [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Quebec]], and [[Saskatchewan]]. The three territories are the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Yukon]]. The provinces have a [[Canadian federalism|large degree of autonomy]] from the federal government, the territories somewhat less. Each has its own [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial or territorial symbols]].

The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.

All provinces have [[unicameral]], elected [[Legislative Assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories|legislatures]] headed by a [[premier (Canada)|Premier]] selected in the same way as the Prime Minister of Canada. Each province also has a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]] representing the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], analogous to the Governor General of Canada, appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, though with increasing levels of consultation with provincial governments in recent years.

In eastern Canada, the Saint Lawrence River widens into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the world's largest [[estuary]]; the island of [[Newfoundland]] lies at its mouth. South of the Gulf, the [[Canadian Maritimes]] protrude eastward from the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] of Quebec. [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] are divided by the [[Bay of Fundy]], which experiences the world's largest tidal variations. [[Ontario]] and [[Hudson Bay]] dominate central Canada. West of Ontario, the broad, flat [[Canadian Prairies]] spread toward the [[Rocky Mountains]], which separate them from [[British Columbia]].

[[Northern Canada|Northern Canadian]] vegetation tapers from [[coniferous]] forests to [[tundra]] and finally to Arctic barrens in the far north.  The northern Canadian mainland is ringed with a vast [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|archipelago]] containing some of the [[List of islands by area|world's largest islands]].

Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary depending on the location. Winters can be harsh in many regions of the country, particularly in the Prairie provinces, where daily average temperatures are near &minus;15°[[Celsius|C]] (5°[[Fahrenheit|F]]), but can drop below -40°C (-40°F) with severe wind chills.<ref name="twn_regina">{{cite web |author=The Weather Network |authorlink=The Weather Network |publisher=The Weather Network |url=http://www.theweathernetwork.ca/weather/stats/pages/C02072.htm?CASK0261 |title=Statistics, Regina SK |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> Coastal British Columbia is an exception and enjoys a temperate climate with a mild and rainy winter.

Canada's two official languages, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], are the [[mother tongue]]s of 59.7% and 23.2% of the population respectively,<ref name="statscan_language">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo11a.htm |title=Population by mother tongue, by province and territory|date=[[2005-01-27]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> and the languages most spoken at home by 68.3% and 22.3% of the population respectively.<ref name=home_language_2001>{{cite web| url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&PID=55535&APATH=3&GID=431515&METH=1&PTYPE=55440&THEME=41&FOCUS=0&AID=0&PLACENAME=0&PROVINCE=0&SEARCH=0&GC=0&GK=0&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&FL=0&RL=0&FREE=0|title=Language Spoken Most Often at Home (8), Language Spoken at Home on a Regular Basis (9), Sex (3) and Age Groups (15) for Population, for Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas 1  and Census Agglomerations, 2001 Census - 20% Sample Data| work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population| accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> On [[July 7]], [[1969]], under the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], French was made commensurate to English throughout the federal government. This started a process that led to Canada redefining itself as an officially [[bilingual]] nation.

English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French. While [[Official Multiculturalism Act|multiculturalism is official policy]], to become a citizen one must be able to speak either English or French, and 98.5% of Canadians speak at least one (English only: 67.5%, French only: 13.3%, both: 17.7%).<ref name="statscan_language2">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo15a.htm |title=Population by knowledge of official language, by province and territory|date=[[2005-01-27]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref>

French is mostly spoken in Quebec, but there are substantial Francophone populations elsewhere, mainly in the northern parts of New Brunswick, eastern, northern and southwestern Ontario, and southern Manitoba. Of those who speak French as a first language, 85% live in Quebec. Ontario has the largest French population outside Quebec. French has been the only official language of Quebec since 1974; New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province in the country.<ref>While Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages, New Brunswick is the only province to have a statement of official bilingualism in the constitution. See [http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/lo-ol/pubs/mythes/english/abc.html Canadian Heritage]</ref> No provinces other than Quebec and New Brunswick have constitutionally official language(s) as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and other government services in all of the majority English or [[Inuktitut]] speaking provinces and territories. In Ontario, French has some legal status but is not fully co-official. Several aboriginal languages have official status in Northwest Territories. [[Inuktitut]] is the majority language in Nunavut, and one of three official languages in the territory.

Non-official languages are important in Canada, with 5,202,245 people listing one as a first language.<ref name="statscan_language" /> Some significant non-official first languages include [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (853,745 first-language speakers), [[Italian language|Italian]] (469,485), [[German language|German]] (438,080), and [[Punjabi]] (271,220).<ref name="statscan_language" />

[[Image:RCMP officer Expo 67.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], seen here at [[Expo 67]], are the federal and national police force of Canada and an international icon.]]

Canadian culture has historically been influenced by [[British people|British]], [[French people|French]], and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] cultures and traditions. It has also been influenced by [[American culture]] because of its proximity and migration between the two countries. American media and entertainment are popular if not dominant in Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the US and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |first=John D. |last=Blackwell |url=http://www.iccs-ciec.ca/blackwell.html#culture |title=Culture High and Low |year=2005 |accessdate=2006-03-15 |publisher=International Council for Canadian Studies World Wide Web Service}}</ref> Many cultural products are marketed toward a unified "North American" or global market.

The creation and preservation of distinctly Canadian culture are supported by federal government programs, laws and institutions such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).<ref>{{cite web |author=National Film Board of Canada |authorlink=National Film Board of Canada |url=http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&lg=en |title=Mandate of the National Film Board |year=2005|accessdate=2006-03-15}}</ref> 

[[Image:Kwakwaka'wakw big house.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] [[totem pole]] and traditional "big house" in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria, BC]].]]
Canada is a geographically vast and ethnically diverse country. There are cultural variations and distinctions from province to province and region to region. Canadian culture has also been greatly influenced by immigration from all over the world. Many Canadians value [[multiculturalism]], and see Canadian culture as being inherently multicultural.<ref name="bickerton" /> Multicultural heritage is enshrined in [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  

[[National symbols of Canada|National symbols]] are influenced by natural, historical, and [[First Nations]] sources. Particularly, the use of the [[maple leaf]], as a Canadian symbol, dates back to the early 18th century and is depicted on its [[Flag of Canada|current]] and [[Red Ensign|previous]] flags, the [[penny (Canadian coin)|penny]], and on the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|coat of arms]].<ref name="symbol1">{{cite book | author=Canadian Heritage | title=Symbols of Canada | year=2002 | location=Ottawa, ON | id=ISBN 0-660-18615-2 | publisher=Canadian Government Publishing}}</ref> Other prominent symbols include the [[beaver]], [[Canada goose]], [[common loon]], [[Monarchy in Canada|the Crown]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]].<ref name="symbol1"/>

Canada's official national sports are [[ice hockey]] (winter) and [[lacrosse]] (summer).<ref name="National Sports of Canada Act">{{cite web | url= http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/N-16.7/251603.html | title= National Sports of Canada Act (1994) | work = Consolidated Statutes and Regulations| accessdate= 2006-07-20 | publisher= [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]]}}</ref> Hockey is a [[national pastime]] and the most popular spectator sport in the country.
