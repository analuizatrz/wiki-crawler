'''''Casino Royale''''' is the 21st [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]] and the first to star [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. Based on the [[1953 in literature|1953]] novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' by [[Ian Fleming]], it was adapted by screenwriters [[Neal Purvis]], [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]], and [[Paul Haggis]] and was directed by [[Martin Campbell]], director of the [[1995 in film|1995]] Bond film ''[[GoldenEye]]''. The film is a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the Bond franchise, establishing a new [[alternate history|timeline]] and narrative framework not meant to precede ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' or any previous films.<ref>{{cite web | title=IGN: Interview: Campbell on Casino Royale | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/659/659741p1.html | work=IGN.com | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc | date=[[2005-10-19]] | accessdate=2007-03-22 }}</ref> It is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, which was previously produced as a [[Casino Royale (novel)#The 1954 television episode|1954 television episode]] and a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 film spoof]]. However, the [[2006 in film|2006]] release is the only official [[EON Productions]] adaptation of Fleming's novel.

The film is set at the beginning of James Bond's career as a 00-agent, having earned his [[Licence to kill (concept)|license to kill]]. After foiling a [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack on [[Miami International Airport]], Bond falls for [[Vesper Lynd]], his financier and guide into ''Casino Royale'' in [[Montenegro]], where he must foil a high-stakes [[poker tournament]] led by [[Le Chiffre]]. It was produced by EON Productions for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], marking the first official Bond film to be [[Coproduction|co-produced]] by the latter studio, which had produced and originally distributed the 1967 [[Canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] spoof film version. The film, and Daniel Craig's performance in particular, quickly earned critical acclaim. It is the highest grossing James Bond film to date.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1360000986.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title= "Casino" sets worldwide Bond record |accessdate=2006-12-25}}</ref> It is also the [[List of highest-grossing films|32nd highest-grossing film of all-time]] and the 6th highest grossing film of all-time in the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web | title = All Time | publisher = The Sky is Falling | url =  http://www.sky-is-falling.co.uk/archives-alltime.html | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref>

==Production==
[[EON Productions]] gained the rights for ''Casino Royale'' in 1999 after Sony exchanged them for MGM's rights to [[Spider-Man]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Devin Zydel|title=Barbara Broccoli On Bond, Daniel Craig, And More|publisher=CommanderBond.net|date=[[2007-02-13]]| url=http://commanderbond.net/article/4104| accessdate =2007-05-08}}</ref> In March 2004, [[Neal Purvis]] and [[Robert Wade]] began writing a screenplay with [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Bond, aiming to bring back an [[Ian Fleming]] flavour.<ref>{{cite news|title=Purvis & Wade Talk Bond & Jinx|publisher=MI6.co.uk|date=[[2004-03-09]]|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/event_purvis_wade_talk.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] expressed interest in directing an adaptation of ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Kill Bill director aims for Bond|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2004-05-16]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3718975.stm|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> though this was only a personal interest, and he didn't follow this up with talks with EON.

''Casino Royale'' became the first Bond film to take its title from an Ian Fleming novel or short story since 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. It is also the first Bond film since ''The Living Daylights'' not to be adapted as a [[novelization]]. Instead a film [[tie-in]] edition of Fleming's original novel was published in the UK on [[October 31]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Stamos | first = Athena | title = Casino Royale Movie Tie-in Edition | publisher = CommanderBond.net |date=[[2006-04-02]] | url = http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/3165-1.shtml | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Image:007CraigbecomingBond.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A significant moment in the James Bond franchise as Daniel Craig makes the official press appearance on [[October 14]] [[2005]] when he is announced as the sixth James Bond]]
Pierce Brosnan had a three film contract with an option of the fourth that expired with ''[[Die Another Day]]''. In the ''Die Another Day'' DVD, Brosnan stated: "I had a blast. I wanted to go out with a high note (''Die Another Day''), but I think it's time for both me and the producers to move on. I'm done with Bond". Throughout 2004 and 2005, an endless stream of potential new "Bonds", both unknowns and established Hollywood actors, were announced by some media. Michael G. Wilson claimed there was a list of over 200 names.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.subzeroblue.com/archives/2005/10/daniel_craig_is_the_.html| title= Michael G.

But, according to Campbell, [[Henry Cavill]] was the only actor in serious contention for the role of James Bond. Campbell decided to pass on Cavill because he believed that he was too young; at the time Cavill was 22 years old.<ref name="cast2">{{cite web | url=http://www.latinoreview.com/films_2005/sonypictures/zorro2/mc-interview.html | publisher=Latino Review | title=Interview with Martin Campbell | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> 

In May 2005, Daniel Craig stated that MGM had assured him that he had the job, likewise [[Matthew Vaughn]] told reporters that MGM offered him the opportunity to direct, but for both EON Productions had not approached them.<ref>{{cite web | title=Craig, Vaughn on Bond | url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/609/609721p1.html |date=[[2005-05-03]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> Later, Craig stated that the producers offered him the role, but he turned the role down when they didn't have a script for him to read first.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bond is Dead!

On [[October 14]] [[2005]], EON Productions and Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed to the public that Daniel Craig would be the new James Bond.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://us.imdb.com/news/sb/2005-10-14#film3 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=The Name's Craig, Daniel Craig | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

After Daniel Craig was announced as James Bond, attention turned to the casting of the lead [[Bond girl]], [[Vesper Lynd]]. [[Casting (performing arts)|Casting director]] Debbie McWilliams has acknowledged that [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Charlize Theron]] were "strongly considered" for the role.<ref>{{cite web| title = Casino Royale Bond girl candidates | publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]] |date= [[2006-07-07]]| url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_girl_casting_rumours.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> McWilliams also stated that [[CÃ©cile de France]] auditioned for the role, but her [[English English|English accent]] "wasn't up to scratch." [[Audrey Tautou]] was also considered, but ultimately not chosen because of her role in ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' that was released in May 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4470 | title= The New Bond Girls! | publisher = superherohype.com |date= [[2006-07-07]] | accessdate=2006-03-04}}</ref> [[Eva Green]] was finally announced as having been cast on [[February 16]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://us.imdb.com/news/sb/2006-02-17#film5 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=New Bond Girl Will Be "Very Much an Equal to Bond" | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[Image:Casino_Royale_settings.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Locations where ''Casino Royale'' takes place.]]
[[Principal photography]] for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on [[January 30]], [[2006]], and concluded on [[July 21]], [[2006]]. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]], with additional location shooting in the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Production returned to its traditional home of [[Pinewood Studios]] to complete the shooting schedule.<ref name="Real"> ''Casino Royale'' DVD documentary ''James Bond: For Real'', [2007]</ref>

Initially, Michael G. Wilson confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would be filmed and/or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, following problems for EON Productions in securing film locations in South Africa,<ref>{{cite news | last = Cox| first = John| title = Eon facing South African detour| publisher = CommanderBond.net|date= [[2005-08-08]]| url = http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2877 | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and Phil Meheux (director of photography) were scouting [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Paradise Island]] in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] as a possible location for the film.<ref> {{cite news | last = Cox| first = John| title = Bond bound for Bahamas|date=[[2005-09-13]] | publisher = CommanderBond.net | url = http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2922| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> On [[October 6]], [[2005]], Martin Campbell confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would film in the Bahamas and "maybe Italy." In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work was done at the [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague and at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, where the film used several stages as well as the paddock tank and the historic [[Albert R. Broccoli]] [[Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage|007 Stage]]. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for [[Dunsfold]] Aerodrome in [[Surrey]], the cricket pavilion at [[Eton College]] (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].<ref name="Location2">{{cite news | last = Matheson | first = Veronica | title = On the trail of James Bond | publisher = News.com.au |date=  | url = http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,23483,20707920-27978,00.html | accessdate =2007-03-23}}</ref>
[[Image:Daniel Craig on Venice yacht crop w Wilson.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Craig and Michael G. Wilson in Venice during filming.]]
After principal photography had commenced in Prague on [[January 30]] [[2006]], the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around [[New Providence]] were used for filming during February and March, largely on Paradise Island and in the southern Coral Harbour area, with an abandoned Royal Bahamian Air Force base being a particularly important location for the production. Footage set in Uganda was filmed at Black Park, Country Park in Buckinghamshire concluding on [[July 4]] [[2006]]. Additional scenes took place at Albany House â an estate recently acquired by golfers [[Ernie Els]] and [[Tiger Woods]].<ref>{{cite news | title = James Bond takes over Ernie and Tiger's pad | publisher = Ernie Els Official Website |date= [[2006-06-12]] | url = http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, [[PlanÃ¡ (Tachov District)|PlanÃ¡]] and [[Loket]], before completing in the town of [[Karlovy Vary]] in May. A disused [[destination spa|spa]], formerly known as the Kaisersbad, in Karlovy Vary was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale, with the [[Grandhotel Pupp]] serving as the "Hotel Splendide" where Bond stays during his time in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite news | title = On set report from Casino Royale getaway chase sequence | publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]] |date= [[2006-05-23]]| url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=3701&catid=2 | accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> The main Italian location alluded to by Campbell is [[Venice]], where the majority of the film's ending is set. Other scenes in the latter half of the film were filmed in late May and early June at the [[Villa del Balbianello]] on the shores of [[Lake Como]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Roth | first = Tim | title = Italian location revealed | publisher = CommanderBond.net |date= [[2006-02-28]] | url = http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/3119-1.shtml | accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa la Gaeta, near the lakeside town of [[Menaggio]].<ref name="Location2"/>

On [[July 30]], [[2006]], a fire broke out at the [[007 Stage|Albert R. Broccoli 007 Stage]] at Pinewood. The damage was significant, but had no effect on the release of ''Casino Royale'' as the sets were in the process of being taken down.<ref>{{cite news | title = Fire wrecks James Bond film stage| publisher = [[BBC News]]|date= [[2006-07-30]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5228794.stm| accessdate =2006-11-21 }}</ref> The incident occurred one week after filming of ''Casino Royale'' had been completed.

===Special effects===
{{spoilers}}
Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor for Casino Royale, [[Chris Corbould]], like the producers was also keen to return to a more realistic style of filmmaking and significantly reduce the digital effects in Casino Royale. âCGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real, itâs the best way to go.â he says.<ref name="for real">{{cite video | year = 2007 | title = For Real | format = DVD | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal}}</ref> 

The three biggest scenes involving special effects in the film were those involving Bond giving chase to Mollaka at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami International Airport tarmac chase sequence, where Bond is pursuing the terrorist Carlos intent on blowing up the  prototype Skyfleet plane and finally, the sinking [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian house]], with scenes located in Venice on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios in the Paddock Tank and the 007 Stage.

First on the schedule were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot on location in the 
Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel which producer Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with as far back as 1977 during the filming of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''. In the scene, Bond gets into an 18-ton [[Engineering vehicle|digger]] and drives well over 30 miles per hour toward the building, destroying a hut, then slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. They built a model and put forward two or three ways that the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the wall was removed to fit the digger, and reinforced with steel and after two tests, the concrete curled around the bucket and it came out like a wave.<ref name="for real"/>

The sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in [[Surrey]], with some footage captured at Prague and Miami airports with the first and second units of the film taking some 10 weeks to shoot the entire sequence. Coubold stated; "Iâve had experience with tankers before in ''[[License to Kill]]'', and they are beasts to work with once you have all that tonnage hurling around; we souped up the tankers to get some high-speed collisions."<ref name="for real"/> In filming the scene in which the engines of the moving aircraft throw the police car into the air, second units directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attatched to the rear of the vehicle to launch the car up and backwards away from the plane. 

The sinking Venetian house at the action climax of the film was the largest rig ever built on any Bond film.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cinema Review | url =http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=3743  | accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref>
For the scene involving Bond following Vesper and Gettler into the house undergoing renovation, supported by inflatable [[balloon]]s, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian [[piazza]] and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig weighed some 90 tons combining together [[electronics]] and [[hydraulic]] valves, closely controlled by computer because of such dynamic movement within the system on its two axis. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team also had built, built to one-third scale, to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in 19 feet of water, and utilized banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement, used in the scene of Vesper's death.

The scene involving the high speed car crash was devised using a specially modified and reinforced Aston Martin DBS to counteract the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18 inch ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac and stunt driver Adam Kirley had to use an air canon located behind the drivers seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a velocity well exceeding 70 mph the car rotated fully seven times during the take, and was later confirmed by the [[Guiness Book of Records]] on [[November 5]] [[2006]] as a new [[World Record]], the previous being five."<ref name="for real"/>

==Plot==
<!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Please help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot of Casino Royale does not belong here. -->

[[Image:GunBarrelPhoto.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[gunbarrel sequence]] modified as part of the opening sequence]]
James Bond must make two kills to qualify for double-0 status, granting him a licence to kill. In the opening sequence, he is sent on a mission to [[Prague]] to make those kills: [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] section chief, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Dryden|Dryden]], who has sold British secrets, and his contact, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Fisher|Fisher]]. In his first mission as a double-0, he is sent to [[Madagascar]] in pursuit of international bomb-maker [[Mollaka]] ([[SÃ©bastien Foucan]]). After a [[free running]] chase to the Nambutu embassy, he is forced to kill the bomb-maker and blow up part of the embassy to escape. Bond's actions are recorded on [[closed-circuit television]] and exposed in the world press, enraging [[M (James Bond)|M]], his boss at MI6.

Bond then visits the [[Bahamas]] to find a man named [[Alexander Dimitrios]], who works for [[Le Chiffre]], an unscrupulous banker who manages money for terrorist organizations and uses it to [[short selling|short sell]] certain companies' stocks. While there, Bond wins Dimitrios's 1964 [[Aston Martin DB5]] in a poker game. Afterwards whilst seducing his wife [[Solange (James Bond)|Solange]], she informs Bond that her husband is flying to Miami, and Bond pursues immediately. At Miami, Bond quickly kills Dimitrios, and pursues Le Chiffre's henchman Carlos through the [[Miami International Airport|airport]] terminal and out along the runway in a fuel truck. He eventually foils Le Chiffre's plan to blow up the prototype ''Skyfleet'' airliner on display, putting Le Chiffre in serious debt.
 
Now under pressure to recoup his clients' money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament to bankrupt Le Chiffre, hoping that he will be forced to aid the British government in exchange for protection from his creditors. Bond meets up with [[List of James Bond allies in Casino Royale#Ren.C3.A9 Mathis|Mathis]], his contact in Montenegro, and [[Vesper Lynd]], a [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] agent, who is assigned to look after Bond's handling of the [[United States dollar|$]]10 million buy-in. When Bond misreads Le Chiffre as bluffing and loses his initial stake, Vesper refuses to give him the funds to [[buying in|rebuy]]. When Bond almost resorts to murdering Le Chiffre, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s [[Felix Leiter]] steps in and gives him the money in exchange for Le Chiffre. Bond wins the tournament, despite attempts to kill him. However before the CIA can take Le Chiffre into custody, he kidnaps Vesper and lures Bond into a near-fatal car chase, which results in his capture as well. Le Chiffre [[torture]]s Bond by repeatedly striking his testicles with a knotted rope to make him reveal the account password to the game's winnings. When it becomes clear that Bond will not give in, Le Chiffre advances to [[castration|castrate]] him, but before he can, [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] arrives and kills Le Chiffre and his associates, leaving Bond and Vesper alive.
[[Image:CasinoRoyalePhoto.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond and Le Chiffre face off at Casino Royale]]
Bond awakens in a hospital on [[Lake Como]] and has Mathis, whom Le Chiffre suggested was a [[double agent]], arrested. Bond admits his love for Vesper and vows to quit the service before it strips him of his humanity. When she agrees, Bond e-mails his resignation to M, and the two go on a romantic holiday in [[Venice]]. Bond soon learns that the funds were never deposited in the Treasury's account and finds Vesper taking the money through Venice to a mysterious organization only vaguely alluded to throughout the film. Bond pursues them into a building under renovation and deliberately shoots the flotation balloons supporting the structure causing the foundation to slowly collapse into the [[Grand Canal of Venice|Grand Canal]]. Vesper tearfully apologizes to Bond and commits suicide by locking herself in an elevator that sinks underwater. Bond tries frantically to rescue her and eventually manages to break into the elevator and bring Vesper to the surface, but it is too late; she has already drowned. Mr. White standing on an opposite balcony surveying the scene, walks away with the money. 

Bond, feeling betrayed, learns that MI6 believed Vesper only negotiated the handover of money in order to save Bond's life from Le Chiffre and the organization, showing her true love for him. Bond, who has Vesper's mobile phone, discovers that she intentionally left Mr. White's name and number for him to find. In the closing scene, Mr. White, arriving at a large palatial estate aside Lake Como, receives a phone call. A voice on the line says, "Mr. White? We need to talk." As White asks "Who is this?" he is shot in the leg. As he crawls along the ground towards the villa, Bond appears, gun in hand, and responds with the iconic [[catch phrase]] "The name's Bond, James Bond," as the credits roll.

Two major exclusions from the film are the characters of [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny]]. They were not included in the screenplay, which makes this only the second Bond film without Q since his initial appearance in Dr. No (1973's ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' being the first) and the first without Moneypenny. In October 2005, producer Michael G. Wilson stated that the omission of the characters was due to the characters not appearing in the novel; however, Moneypenny was in the novel and had one line of dialogue, although [[Q (James Bond)|Major Boothroyd]], which the films transformed into the character Q, did not appear until several books later.<ref>{{cite news| last = Hastings | first = Chris | coauthors = Nina Goswami and David Fickling | title = Ah, Miss Moneypenny.

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack to the 2006 film ''Casino Royale'' was released by [[Sony Classical]] on [[November 14]], [[2006]]. The music was composed by veteran composer [[David Arnold]] and is Arnold's fourth soundtrack for the film series. Frequent collaborator Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the score. 

The title song "[[You Know My Name]]" is performed by [[Chris Cornell]] and is the first theme song since 1983's ''[[Octopussy]]'' to use a different title other than the film.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.davidarnold.com| title=David Arnold| accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> However, the theme song is not present on the album soundtrack since it was released as a separate single. Consistent with the reboot of the James Bond storyline, only at the end, when Bond resumes his usual role, is the original  James Bond theme used.
