The '''Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA)''' provides mass transit bus service and [[paratransit]] within the metro [[Lansing, Michigan]] area  (the Michigan capital) including [[Michigan State University]].

==CATA system==
CATA operates both bus transit and paratransit service across a 600-square-mile area throughout metro [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] including [[Michigan State University]].   CATA boasts the second highest ridership in the state of [[Michigan]], with a total ridership of 9,351,227 in 2005 and over 10 million in 2006.

CATA has at least 300 employees.  It does not operate on major holidays.

===Bus service===
Referred to as "fixed route service", CATA's standard bus service operates on thirty routes with both rigid 40 ft. and [[Articulated bus|articulated]] 60 ft. buses.  Most of these are [[low floor]] buses manufactured by [[New Flyer]], however a few older high floor [[General Motors|GM]] [[Rapid Transit Series]] remain in the fleet.  The bus service hub is at the CATA Transportation Center (CTC) in downtown Lansing, with a satellite hub on the MSU campus (see below).  In August of 2006, CATA added the first three [[hybrid electric]] buses to its fleet (New Flyer DE40LFR); making CATA the first company in Michigan to operate hybrid buses.  Since then it has continued to purchase more.

Fixed route buses use a GPS-based system manufactured by Luminator USA that periodically plays a voice-recording of the bus's location over the loudspeakers.  This is particularly useful to the visually-imparied and users who are unfamiliar with the area.  All buses are also equipped with fold-out ramps for users in wheelchairs.

CATA operates a satellite hub, called the MSU/CATA Transportation Center, on the [[Michigan State University]] campus.  This center serves as a hub for CATA's MSU-based routes; it also consists of a large public [[parking ramp]].  Many of the MSU-area routes are called "Spartan Service" - this means that the route only operates during the MSU fall and spring semesters.  This includes all routes numbered 30-38.  Other routes are partially Spartan Service, that is, they run more frequently and/or longer into the night during these times.

A few of CATA's routes are referred to as "[[trolley]] lines" - however, these lines are actually served by trolley-styled buses.  In the earlier part of the 20th century, Lansing did have actual trolley lines, however those were not operated by CATA.

===Paratransit===
CATA operates several paratransit services using small buses.  One service, Spec-Tran, is offered to the elderly and disabled.  Other services are offered to the general public.  One such service, the "Night Owl", offers rides across the MSU campus every night from 2 am to 7 am (9 am on weekends) in order to give students a safer way to traverse campus at these hours.

==Fare structures==
CATA offers a variety of payment methods and fares.

===Cash and CATACash===
Riders paying by cash use the following fare structure for each one-way trip.  All transfers from one route to another are free.
*Seniors, disabled, and students: [[United States dollar|US$]]0.50
*Children under 42 inches tall: Free
*All others: [[United States dollar|US$]]1.00

The same structure applies to riders using CATACash cards.  CATACash cards are issued as change during cash transactions.

===Tokens===
Riders may use one CATA token for a one-way trip; again, transfers to another route are free.  Tokens may be purchased in sets of 10 for [[United States dollar|US$]]8.50 at various retail outlets around the area.  They cannot be purchased on board busses.

===Passes===

*MSU Communter Lot Pass (unlimited rides on Route 32 only): [[United States dollar|US$]]16.50 for one semester, [[United States dollar|US$]]27.50 for two semesters

==Bicycles on CATA==
[[Bicycle]] racks are installed on the front of all CATA buses, except the trolley-style busses.  Each bus can accommodate up to two bicycles.

CATA also rents out bike lockers located in downtown [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[East Lansing]], and [[Lansing Community College|LCC]].
