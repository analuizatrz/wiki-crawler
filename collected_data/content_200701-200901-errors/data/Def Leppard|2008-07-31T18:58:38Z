'''Def Leppard''' are an [[England|English]] [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Sheffield]], who formed in 1977 as part of the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] movement. Largely on the strength of their albums ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' and ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]'', Def Leppard became one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|top-selling]] rock bands throughout the 1980s, selling over 65 million albums worldwide,<ref name="sales">[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=44388 News Archive], blabbermouth.net.</ref> including over 35 million in the United States alone.  Def Leppard are ranked #31 on VH1's "Greatest Artists of Hard Rock".<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_greatest/62187/episode_wildcard.jhtml?wildcard=/shows/dynamic/includes/wildcards/the_greatest/hardrock_list_full.jhtml&event_id=862768&start=61 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock], VH1.com.</ref>

==Musical style==
Def Leppard's music is a mixture of [[hard rock]], [[album-oriented rock]] (AOR), and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] elements, with its multi-layered, harmonic vocals and its melodic guitar riffs. However, even though they were often considered the leaders of the [[New Wave Of British Heavy Metal|NWOBHM]] movement of the late '70s, in the mid-1980's they had associated more with the [[pop metal]] movement, in large part due to their mainstream success and production. Despite all of this, Def Leppard have expressed dislike of the "pop metal" label.<ref>[http://heavymetalmusic.biz/2007/07/06/def-leppard-craves-respect-in-interview/ Def Leppard craves respect in interview], heavymetalmusic.biz.</ref>

By the release of the ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]'' album, the band had developed a distinctive sound featuring heavy drums and effects-laden guitar sounds overlaid with a multi-layered wall of husky, harmonised vocals. Def Leppard is one of only five rock bands with two original albums selling over 10 million copies each in the US. The others are [[The Beatles]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]], and [[Van Halen]].

==History==
===1977–1979===
[[Rick Savage]] (bass), [[Pete Willis]] (guitar), and [[Tony Kenning]] (drums), all students at [[Tapton School]] in [[Sheffield]], formed a band called ''Atomic Mass'' in 1977. Following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus, 18-year old [[Joe Elliott]] tried out for the band as a guitarist. During his audition, however, it was decided that he was better suited to be lead singer. 

Soon afterward they adopted a name proposed by Elliott, "Deaf Leopard", which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class <ref>according to the book "Bang Your Head: The Rise And Fall Of Heavy Metal" by David Konow.</ref> At Kenning's suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band and perhaps also as an indirect homage to [[Led Zeppelin]].

Having rented a practice space in an old spoon factory in [[Bramall Lane]], Def Leppard added a second guitarist, [[Steve Clark]], in January 1978 and spent the following months developing their sound. In November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as the ''[[Def Leppard EP]]'', Kenning abruptly left the band. He was replaced for those sessions by [[Frank Noon]]. By the end of the month [[Rick Allen (drummer)|Rick Allen]], then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer.

Sales of the EP soared after the track "Rocks Off" was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio DJ [[John Peel]], considered at the time to be a champion of [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music]]. 

Throughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British [[hard rock]]/[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans and were even initially considered the leaders of the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] (a status eventually claimed by [[Iron Maiden]]). Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US).

===1980–1983===
Def Leppard's debut album, ''[[On Through the Night]]'', was released on March 14, 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences{{Fact|date=September 2007}} by recording songs like "Hello America" and touring more in the US (supporting [[Pat Travers]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Ted Nugent]]). A performance at the Reading Festival in August (Iron Maiden also appeared) was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with garbage.

The band had by then caught the attention of AC/DC producer [[Robert Lange|Robert John "Mutt" Lange]], who agreed to work on their second album, ''[[High 'n' Dry]]'', released on July 11, 1981. Lange's legendary meticulous approach in the studio helped them realise their potential better, which is evident on ''High 'n' Dry.'' 

Despite the album's unimpressive sales figures, the "[[Bringin' on the Heartbreak]]" promo clip became one of the first metal videos played on [[MTV]] in 1982, bringing the band increased visibility in the States. By the time the album was out, a European tour followed. The band opened for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]].<ref>[http://defleppard.com/band/index.html Band Biography], DefLeppard.com.</ref>

[[Phil Collen]], former guitarist with the glam band [[Girl (band)|Girl]], replaced [[Pete Willis]], who was fired on July 11, 1982, due to excessive [[alcohol]] consumption on the job. (Willis would later resurface with the bands [[Gogmagog (band)|Gogmagog]] and [[Roadhouse (band)|Roadhouse]].) This personnel change took place during the recording of their third album, ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'', which was released on January 20, 1983 and also produced by Lange. 

The lead single, "Photograph," turned Def Leppard into a household name, supplanting [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Beat It]]" as the most requested video clip on [[MTV]] and becoming a staple of rock radio (dominating the US Album Rock Charts for six weeks).  It also hit #12 on the pop charts.

Fueled by "Photograph" and subsequent singles "Rock of Ages" and "Foolin'", ''Pyromania'' went on to sell six million copies in 1983 (at least more than 100,000 copies every week in that year) and was held off the top of the US album charts only by Michael Jackson's ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]].'' The album has since been certified [[Diamond album|Diamond]] by the [[RIAA]] in the US and is considered a classic in both the mainstream rock and heavy metal genres.

Def Leppard's US tour in support of ''Pyromania'' began by opening for [[Billy Squier]] in March and ended with a headlining performance before an audience of 55,000 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, CA in September.

As a testament to the band's popularity at the time, a US Gallup poll in 1984 saw Def Leppard voted as favourite rock band over peers such as [[the Rolling Stones]], AC/DC, and [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. However, this popularity was not matched in their native England, a fact that greatly bothered them.

===1984–1989===
Following their breakthrough, the band moved to [[Dublin]] in February 1984 for tax purposes to begin writing the follow-up to ''Pyromania''.  Mutt Lange initially joined in on the songwriting sessions but then suddenly declined to return as producer due to exhaustion. Instead, [[Jim Steinman]] (of [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat out of Hell]]'' fame) was brought in.

On December 31, 1984, drummer [[Rick Allen (drummer)|Rick Allen]] lost his left arm in a car crash on the [[A57 road|A57]] in the hills outside Sheffield when his speeding [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Rick was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer. He practised drumming with pillows and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms. He then worked with [[Simmons (electronic drum company)|Simmons]] to design a custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum kit]]. 

The other members of the band supported Rick's recovery and never sought a replacement. During this period, Mutt Lange eventually returned to the fold as producer, and Rick's triumphant comeback was sealed at the 1986 [[Donington Park|Donington]] [[Monsters of Rock]] festival with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by [[Joe Elliott]]. 

Def Leppard's fourth album, ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]'', was finally released on August 3, 1987. 
The second single from the album, "Animal", reached #6 in the UK and finally turned the band into stars in their home country. ''Hysteria'' immediately topped the charts in its first week of release.

US album sales were relatively slow (compared to ''Pyromania'') until the fourth single, "Pour Some Sugar On Me". The song hit Number 2, and ''Hysteria'' finally reached the top of the US Album Charts in July 1988. The "Pour Some Sugar on Me" video was #1 on [[Dial MTV]] for a record 73 days (from May 26-September 5, 1988). In October, the power ballad "[[Love Bites (Def Leppard song)|Love Bites]]" would become Def Leppard's first (and only) Number One single on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and in January 1989, the band scored another US Top 5 hit with "Armageddon It."

''Hysteria'' is one of only a handful of albums (and the third in rock history) that has charted seven singles or more on the US Hot 100: "Women" (#80), "Animal" (#19), "Hysteria" (#10), "[[Pour Some Sugar On Me]]" (#2), "[[Love Bites (Def Leppard song)|Love Bites]]" (#1), "Armageddon It" (#3), and "Rocket" (#12). It remained on the charts for three years and has sold 18 million copies worldwide.

Equally as successful was the accompanying ''Hysteria'' world tour which ran for 15 months and saw Def Leppard perform "In The Round". The concept proved wildly popular with fans, as evidenced in the videos for "[[Pour Some Sugar On Me]]" and "Armageddon It" (and was later used again for the ''[[Adrenalize]]'' tour).

In 1989, Def Leppard won Favorite Heavy Metal Artist as well as Favorite Heavy Metal Album (for "Hysteria") during the American Music Awards. It was the first time that a heavy metal category was added to the awards show. (The category has since been deleted.)

By the end of the decade, although [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Mötley Crüe]], and [[Bon Jovi]] had garnered more mainstream exposure, Def Leppard had sold more records than any rock band in the US, except Van Halen.

===1990–1999===
Following ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]'''s mammoth success, the band quickly set out to work on their fifth album, hoping to avoid another lengthy gap. However, [[Steve Clark]]'s [[alcoholism]] issues worsened to the point that he was constantly in and out of [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. Recording sessions suffered from this distraction, and in mid-1990, Steve was granted a six-month leave of absence from the band. 

Clark never reached the end of his leave, dying from an accidental mix of prescription drugs and alcohol on January 8 1991 in his London home. The remaining band members decided to carry on and recorded the album as a four-piece, with Phil mimicking Steve's style on his intended guitar parts. 

Def Leppard's fifth album, ''[[Adrenalize]]'', was finally released on March 31, 1992. The album simultaneously entered at Number One on both the UK and US album charts, staying on the latter for 5 weeks. The first single, "Let's Get Rocked," was an instant smash hit, and its video was later nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Best Video of the Year]] at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

In April 1992, guitarist [[Vivian Campbell]], formerly of [[Dio]] and [[Whitesnake]], joined Def Leppard, making his official live debut with his band at the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]]. ''[[Adrenalize]]'' yielded six hit singles and sold 7 million copies worldwide. Another successful world tour followed, but the band's fortunes began to be affected by the rise of [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]].

A collection of b-sides and unreleased tracks recorded between 1984 and 1993, called ''[[Retro Active]]'', was released in October [[1993]], preceded by the success of "Two Steps Behind" (from the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] film [[Last Action Hero]]). Another single, "Miss You In A Heartbeat", hit the Top 5 in [[Canada]], becoming one of their biggest hits there. Retro Active has sold 3 million copies worldwide to date.

Two years later, Def Leppard issued their first greatest hits collection, ''[[Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits (1980–1995)]]'', which has sold 8 million copies worldwide. Alternate track listings of the album were issued for North America, the UK, and Japan.

The compilation included a new track, the ballad "When Love & Hate Collide," which became their biggest ever hit in the UK, hitting #2. It peaked at #58 in the U.S. On October 23, 1995, the band entered the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] by performing three concerts in three continents in one day (Tangiers, Morocco; London, England; and Vancouver, Canada).

''[[Slang (album)|Slang]]'', released in May 1996, marked a drastic musical departure for the band by featuring darker lyrics and a stripped-down alternative rock edge. The US audience reception for [[Slang (album)|Slang]] and its subsequent tour was a major dropoff from a decade earlier, but [[Q Magazine]] would nonetheless list ''[[Slang (album)|Slang]]'' as one of the Top Ten Albums of 1996.

[[VH1]] revived the band's fortunes in the US in 1998 by featuring them on one of the first episodes of ''[[Behind The Music]]''. Reruns of the episode yielded some of the series' highest ratings and brought the band's music back into the public consciousness (following years of burial by the alternative rock climate). The episode was even parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

In an effort to capitalise on this new momentum, Def Leppard returned to its classic sound with the 1999 album ''[[Euphoria (Def Leppard album)|Euphoria]]''. The first single, "Promises", reunited the band with [[Mutt Lange]] and hit the US Mainstream Rock charts at #1 for 3 weeks. The album was certified gold in the US and Canada.

===2000–2007===
On September 5, 2000, Def Leppard were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame on [[Hollywood]]'s [[Sunset Boulevard]] by their friend [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].

In 2001, VH1 produced and aired ''[[Hysteria - The Def Leppard Story]]'', a biopic that included [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as [[Mutt Lange]] and [[Amber Valletta]] as Lorelei Shellist ([[Steve Clark]]'s girlfriend). The docudrama covered the band's history between 1977 through 1986, recounting the trials and triumphs of [[Rick Allen]] and [[Steve Clark]]. The July 18 broadcast still produced some of the channel's highest-ever ratings and is available on DVD.

Def Leppard's tenth album, simply titled "X", was released in July 2002. It saw the band's musical direction moving more towards pop and further away from the band's hard rock roots. In fact, some tracks were produced by the hit factory behind [[Britney Spears]] and the [[Backstreet Boys]].

Although greeted with generally positive reviews, ''X'' quickly disappeared from the charts, ultimately becoming the band's least successful release. However, the accompanying tour played to the band's strongest audiences since ''Adrenalize''.

An expanded and updated best-of collection, ''Best Of'', was released internationally in October 2004. The North America-only version, ''Rock Of Ages - The Definitive Collection'', was released the following May. Def Leppard would participate at the [[Live 8]] show in Philadelphia and toured in the summer with Bryan Adams. 2005 also saw the band leave their longtime management team, Q-Prime, and sign with HK Management.

On May 23, 2006, Def Leppard released an all-covers album titled ''[[Yeah! (album)|Yeah!]]''. The disc pays homage to classic rock songs of their childhood, originally recorded by [[ELO]], [[Sweet]], [[The Kinks]],  [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and [[Badfinger]] among others. It debuted at #16 in the US, their tenth consecutive Top 20 album, and has scanned more than 140,000 copies to date.

The band, along with [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and [[Judas Priest]], were the inaugural inductees of "[[VH1 Rock Honors]]" on May 31, 2006. During the show, The [[All-American Rejects]] paid homage to the band with a cover of "Photograph". Soon afterwards, they embarked on a successful US tour with [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. That October, ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]'' was re-released in a two-disc deluxe edition format, which combined the original album, remastered for the first time, with b-sides, remixes, and bonus tracks from single releases.

Def Leppard began their latest tour, the 52-date "[[Downstage Thrust Tour]]", on June 29, which took them across the US and into Canada. Support bands were [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] .

===2008–Present===
[[Image:Def Leppard Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Def Leppard at the [[2008]] [[Sweden Rock Festival]].]]

The band's new album, entitled ''[[Songs from the Sparkle Lounge]]'', was released worldwide on April 28, 2008 and on April 30, 2008 in Japan.  The album debuted at #5 on The Billboard 200 in America. The first single is entitled "[[Nine Lives (Def Leppard single)|Nine Lives]]" and features country singer [[Tim McGraw]], who co-wrote the song with Joe Elliot, Phil Collen, and Rick Savage.

A tour in support of the album began on March 27, 2008 in Greensboro, NC,<ref>http://www.defleppard.com/tour/tour_2008.asp</ref> with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[REO Speedwagon]] joining the band on US dates.  The band will also play several European rock festivals. An arena tour of the UK takes place in June in which the band will co-headline with [[Whitesnake]] and be supported by US southern rockers [[Black Stone Cherry]]. The band then returns to Europe before coming back for a second leg of the UK tour in June. The first of these dates was at the Glasgow SECC on the 17th.

Again they will be joined by [[Whitesnake]]; however Thunder will support at some of these shows. Black Stone Cherry continue to support most of the dates, including some of the Thunder ones. The band has announced that due to an upper respiratory tract infection affecting lead singer, Joe Elliott, they will be postponing Canadian dates.  Two more American shows have been cancelled due to a viral infection affecting Phil Collen.

Def Leppard announced that the 6 shows that were cancelled during their USA/Canada leg of their world tour due to illnesses affecting Joe Elliott and Phil Collen would be rescheduled and played in August this year along with other locations.

On June 11th, Def Leppard announced further dates for their 2008 World Tour. The extension will see them visit India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Whitesnake will continue to support Def Leppard for their Indian and Japanese dates. Australian and New Zealand tour dates will feature [[Cheap Trick]] as support and local Australian, Melbourne based band [[The Galvatrons]] as second support. The AUS/NZ dates include 8 dates seeing them visit major capital cities as well as a few unlikely ones. Def Leppard, Cheap Trick and The Galvatrons will visit Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Newcastle, Brisbane, Wollongong, Canberra and Auckland(NZ).
