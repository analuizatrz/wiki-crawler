The '''Armenian Revolutionary Federation''' ('''ARF''' or '''ՀՅԴ''') ({{lang-hy|Հայ Յեղափոխական Դաշնակցութիւն}} — '''''Hay Heghapokhakan Dashnaktsutiun''''' or '''''Hay Heghapokhagan Tashnagtsutiun''''', {{lang|hy|Դաշնակ}} — '''''Dashnak''''' or '''''Tashnag''''') is an [[Armenian people|Armenian]] [[political party]] founded in [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]] (Tbilisi in modern day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) in [[1890]] by [[Christapor Mikaelian]], [[Stepan Zorian]], and [[Simon Zavarian]].<ref name="Foundation of the ARF">{{cite web | url= http://www.littlearmenia.com/html/history/detail.asp?id=217| title=Armenian Revolutionary Federation Founded, Armenian history timeline|accessdate=2006-12-25}}</ref> The party operates in [[Armenia]] and in countries where the [[Armenian diaspora]] is present, notably in [[Lebanon]] and the ethnically Armenian-dominated [[de facto]] [[Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh]].<ref name="The Lebanon">{{cite web | url= http://www.unhcr.org/home/RSDCOI/456567564.pdf |title= Tachnaq party holds 2 seats in Lebanese National Assembly.|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref><ref name="Karabakh and ARF">{{cite web | url= http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?ChapterID=768&CountryID=2&ReportID=249&keyword= | title=ARF among parties running in NKR elections |accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>

The ARF advocates [[socialism]] and is a member of the [[Socialist International]].<ref name="ARF news 'Yerkir'"/> It possesses the largest number of members from the political parties present in the Armenian diaspora, having established affiliates in more than 200 countries.<ref name="AZG Armenian Daily"/> Compared to other Armenian parties which tend to primarily focus on educational or humanitarian projects, the Dashnaktsutiun is the most politically oriented of the organizations and traditionally has been one of the staunchest supporters of Armenian [[nationalism]].<ref name="AZG Armenian Daily"/> A member of the ARF is called ''Dashnaktsagan'' (in [[Eastern Armenian]]) or ''Tashnagtsagan'' (in [[Western Armenian]]). Other than by calling each other by name, members formally address one another as ''[[Comrade]]'' (Ընկեր or ''Unger'' for boys and men, Ընկերուհի or ''Ungerouhi'' for girls and women).<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.anca.org/ancadesk.php?adid=29 | title=Spotlight: ANC of Rhode Island |accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref>

The ARF became active within the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 1890s with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending Armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire. ARF members formed [[fedayee]] groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance.{{Ref_label|Supernova|β|none}} The Dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a "free, independent and unified" Armenia, although they sometimes set aside this goal in favor of a more realistic approach such as advocating autonomy. 

In 1917, the party was instrumental in the creation of the short-lived [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]], which fell to the [[Soviet]] communists in 1920.<ref name="ARF.am">{{cite web | url= http://arf.am/English| title=ARF.am Home|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref> After its leadership was exiled by the communists, the ARF established itself within Armenian diaspora communities, where it helped Armenians preserve their cultural identity.<ref name="ARF Shant Student Association"/> After the fall of the [[USSR]], it returned to Armenia, where it now again has a significant presence.
== Early history ==
{{seealso|Armenian national liberation movement}}

In the late 1800s, [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Russia]] became the hub of small groups advocating reform in Armenian-populated areas in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1890, recognizing the need to unify these groups in order to be more efficient, [[Christapor Mikaelian]], [[Simon Zavarian]] and [[Stepan Zorian]] created a new political party called the "Federation of Armenian Revolutionaries" ({{lang|hy|Հայ Յեղափոխականներու Դաշնակցութիւն}}), which would eventually be called the "Armenian Revolutionary Federation" or "Dashnaktsutiun" in 1892.<ref name="Origins of the ARF">{{cite book |first = Gerard J. | last = Libaridian | title = Modern Armenia: People, Nation, State | publisher = Transaction Publishers | pages = p. 103, p. 106 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 0765802058}}</ref>
   
[[Image:Arf.jpg|thumb|280px|left|ARF Founders left to right: [[Stepan Zorian]], [[Christapor Mikaelian]], [[Simon Zavarian]]]] The [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] at one point had agreed to join as well, seeing that the ARF's political ideology was [[socialism]]. However, the Hunchakians claimed the new party was not [[Marxist]] enough and withdrew from the union. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in [[Tiflis]], [[Russian Empire]], in 1892.<ref name="Foundation of the ARF">{{cite web | url= http://www.littlearmenia.com/html/history/detail.asp?id=217| title=Armenian Revolutionary Federation Founded, Armenian history timeline|accessdate=2006-12-25}}</ref><ref name="Origins of the ARF">{{cite book |first = Gerard J. | last = Libaridian | title = Modern Armenia: People, Nation, State | publisher = Transaction Publishers | pages = p. 106 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 0765802058}}</ref> At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized ''modus operandi'' according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere. The party set its goal of a society based on the democratic principles of [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[agrarian reform]].<ref name="Foundation of the ARF">{{cite web | url= http://www.littlearmenia.com/html/history/detail.asp?id=217| title=Armenian Revolutionary Federation Founded, Armenian history timeline|accessdate=2006-12-25}}</ref><ref name="Origins of the ARF">{{cite book |first = Gerard J. | last = Libaridian | title = Modern Armenia: People, Nation, State | publisher = Transaction Publishers | pages = p. 106 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 0765802058}}</ref>

=== Russian Empire ===
The ARF gradually acquired significant strength and sympathy among [[Russian Armenians]]. Mainly because of the ARF's stance towards the Ottoman Empire, the party enjoyed the support of the central Russian administration, as [[tsarist]] and ARF foreign policy had the same alignment until 1903.<ref name="Anna Geifman">{{cite book | last = Geifman | first = Anna | title = Thou Shalt Kill: Revolutionary Terrorism in Russia, 1894–1917 | pages = p. 21–22 | id = ISBN 0-691-02549-5}}</ref> On [[June 12]] [[1903]], the tsarist authorities passed an edict to bring all Armenian Church property under imperial control. This was faced by strong ARF opposition, because the ARF perceived the tsarist edict as a threat to the Armenian national existence. As a result, the ARF leadership decided to defend Armenian churches by dispatching militiamen who acted as guards and by holding mass demonstrations.<ref name="Anna Geifman">{{cite book | last = Geifman | first = Anna | title = Thou Shalt Kill: Revolutionary Terrorism in Russia, 1894–1917 | pages = p. 21–22 | id = ISBN 0-691-02549-5}}</ref><ref name="tempest">{{cite book |first = Simon | last = Vratsian | title = Tempest-Born DRO | publisher = Armenian Prelacy, New York, translated by Tamar Der-Ohannesian | pages = pp. 13–22 | year = 2000}}</ref>

In 1905–06, the [[Armenian-Tatar massacres]] broke out during which the ARF became involved in armed activities. Some sources claim that the Russian government incited the massacres in order to reinforce its authority during the revolutionary turmoil of 1905.<ref name="Stalin">{{cite web | url= http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch03.htm |title=
"A Critical Survey of Bolshevism" - Stalin|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> The first outbreak of violence occurred in [[Baku]], in February 1905.

The Shaping of a National Identity in a Muslim Community | publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages = p. 41–42 | year = 1985 | id = ISBN 0521522455}}</ref> The ARF held the Russian authorities responsible for inaction and instigation of massacres that were part of a larger [[Anti-Armenianism|anti-Armenian]] policy. On [[May 11]], [[1905]], Dashnak revolutionary [[Drastamat Kanayan]] assassinated Russian governor general [[Nakashidze]], who was considered by the Armenian population as the main instigator of hate and confrontation between the Armenians and the Tatars. Unable to rely on government forces to protect their interests and properties, the Armenian bourgeoisie turned to the ARF for protection. The Dashnak leaders argued that, given employment discrimination against Armenian workers in non-Armenian concerns, the defence provided to the Armenian bourgeoisie was essential to the safekeeping of employment opportunities for Armenian laborers.<ref>{{cite book | last = Libaridian | first = Gerard J. | title = Modern Armenia: People, Nation, State | pages = p. 17 | id = ISBN 0-691-02549-5}}</ref> The Russian Tsar's envoy in the [[Caucasus]], Vorontsov-Dashkov, reported that the ARF bore a major portion of responsibilities for perpetrating the massacres. According to him, their bands would attack the Muslims and often exterminate the population of entire villages.<ref>{{ru icon}}«Всеподданейшая записка по управлению кавказским краем генерала адьютанта графа Воронцова-Дашкова», СПб.: Государственная Тип., 1907, с.12 </ref> The ARF, however, argued that it helped to organize the defence of the Armenian population against Muslim attacks. The blows suffered at the hands of the Dashnakist fighting squads proved a catalyst for the consolidation of the Muslim community of the Caucasus.<ref name="Tadeusz"/> During that period, the ARF regarded armed activity, including terror, as necessary for the achievement of political goals.<ref>{{cite book | last = Suny | first = Ronald | title = Transcaucasia, Nationalism, and Social Change: Essays in the History of Armenia, 2nd edition | pages = p. 166–167 | year = 1996 | id = ISBN 978-0472066179}}</ref>

In January 1912, 159 ARF members, comprised of lawyers, bankers, merchants and other intellectuals, were tried before the Russian senate for their participation in the party. They were defended by then-lawyer [[Alexander Kerensky]], who challenged much of the evidence used against them as the "original investigators had been encouraged by the local administration to use any available means" to convict the men.<ref>{{cite book

He and several other lawyers "made openly contemptuous declarations" about this discrepancy to the Russian press, which was forbidden to attend the trials, and this in turn greatly embarrassed the senators. The Senate eventually opened an inquiry against the chief [[magistrate]] who had brought the charges against the Dashnak members and concluded that he was insane. Ninety four of the accused were acquitted, while the rest were either imprisoned or exiled for varying periods, the most severe being six years.<ref>Abraham. ''Alexander Kerensky'', p. 54</ref>

=== Ottoman Empire ===
{{Main|Sasun Resistance|1896 Ottoman Bank takeover|Khanasor Expedition|Yildiz Attempt}}

The ARF became a major political force in Armenian life. It was especially active in the Ottoman Empire, where it organized or participated in many revolutionary activities. In 1894, the ARF took part in the [[First Sasun Resistance]], supplying arms to the local population to help the people of Sasun defend themselves against the Hamidian purges.<ref name="Hayots p.42–48">{{hy icon}} {{cite book | last = Kurdoghlian | first = Mihran | title = Hayots Badmoutioun (Armenian History) | publisher = Hradaragutiun Azkayin Oosoomnagan Khorhoortee, Athens Greece | pages = p. 42–48 | year = 1996 }}</ref> In June 1896, the [[Armenakan]]s organized the [[Defense of Van]] in the province of [[Van, Turkey|Van]], where Ottoman [[Hamidieh soldier]]s were to attack the city. The Armenakans, assisted by members of the Hunchakian and ARF parties, supplied all able-bodied men of Van with weapons. They rose to defend the civilians from the attack and subsequent massacre.<ref>Ministère des affaires étrangères, op. cit., no. 212. M. P.

[[Image:Fedayees.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Fedayee group fighting under the ARF banner.

The [[Khanasor Expedition]] was performed by the [[Armenian militia]] against the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] Mazrik tribe on [[July 25]], [[1897]]. During the Defense of Van, the Mazrik tribe had ambushed a squad of Armenian defenders and massacred them. The Khanasor Expedition was the ARF's retaliation.<ref name="Hayots p.42–48"/><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.littlearmenia.com/html/history/detail.asp?id=223| title=Khanasor Expedition, Armenian history timeline|accessdate=2006-12-26}}</ref> Some Armenians consider this their first victory over the Ottoman Empire and celebrate each year in its remembrance.<ref>{{cite book |first = Varoujan | last = Karentz | title = Mitchnapert the Citadel: A History of Armenians in Rhode Island | publisher = iUniverse | pages = p. 166 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 0595306624 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first =  Arpena S. | last = Mesrobian | title = Like One Family: The Armenians of Syracuse  | publisher = Gomidas Institute | pages = p. 222 | year = 2000 | id = ISBN 0953519112 }}</ref>

On [[March 30]], [[1904]], the ARF played a major role in the [[Second Sasun Resistance]]. The ARF sent arms and [[fedayees]] to defend the region for the second time.<ref name="Hayots p.42–48">{{hy icon}} {{cite book | last = Kurdoghlian | first = Mihran | title = Hayots Badmoutioun (Armenian History) | publisher = Hradaragutiun Azkayin Oosoomnagan Khorhoortee, Athens Greece | pages = p. 42–48 | year = 1996 }}</ref> Among the 500 fedayees participating in the resistance were top figures such as [[Kevork Chavush]], Sepasdatsi Murad and Hrayr Djoghk.

In 1905, members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation organized the [[Yildiz Attempt]], an assassination attempt on Sultan Abdul Hamid II in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, [[Constantinople]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]).<ref name="Hayots p.42–48"/> The Yildiz Attempt failed to assassinate the Sultan because the timed bomb missed its target by a few minutes. The Dashnaksutiun also lost one of its founders, Kristapor Mikaelian, in an accidental explosion during the planning of the operation.

=== Young Turk Revolution ===
{{Seealso|Young Turk Revolution}}

Two of the largest revolutionary groups trying to overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II had been the ARF and the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], a group of mostly European-educated Turks.<ref name="Dashnaktsutiun and Committee of Union and Progress">{{cite book |first = Aykut | last = Kansu | title = The Revolution of 1908 in Turkey | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | pages = p. 78 | year = 1997 | id = ISBN 9004102833 }}</ref> In a general assembly meeting in 1907, the ARF acknowledged that the Armenian and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] revolutionaries had the same goals. Although the [[Tanzimat]] reforms had given Armenians more rights and seats in the parliament, the ARF hoped to gain autonomy to govern Armenian populated areas of the Ottoman Empire as a "state within a state". The "Second congress of the Ottoman opposition" took place in [[Paris]], [[France]], in 1907. Opposition leaders including [[Ahmed Riza]] (liberal), [[Sabahheddin Bey]], and ARF member [[Khachatur Maloumian]] attended. During the meeting, an alliance between the two parties was officially declared.<ref name="Dashnaktsutiun and Committee of Union and Progress">{{cite book |first = Aykut | last = Kansu | title = The Revolution of 1908 in Turkey | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | pages = p. 78 | year = 1997 | id = ISBN 9004102833 }}</ref><ref name="ARF and Young Turks">{{hy icon}} {{cite book |first = Mihran | last = Kurdoghlian | title = Hayots Badmoutioun (Armenian History) | publisher = Hradaragutiun Azkayin Oosoomnagan Khorhoortee, Athens Greece | pages = p. 52–53 | year = 1996 }}</ref> The ARF decided to cooperate with the Committee of Union and Progress, hoping that if the Young Turks came to power, autonomy would be granted to the Armenians.

In 1908, Abdul Hamid II was overthrown during the [[Young Turk Revolution]], which launched the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire]]. Armenians gained more seats in the 1908 parliament, but the reforms fell short of the greater autonomy that the ARF had hoped for. The [[Adana massacre]] in 1909 also created antipathy between Armenians and Turks, and the ARF cut relations with the Young Turks in 1912.<ref name="ARF and Young Turks">{{hy icon}} {{cite book |first = Mihran | last = Kurdoghlian | title = Hayots Badmoutioun (Armenian History) | publisher = Hradaragutiun Azkayin Oosoomnagan Khorhoortee, Athens Greece | pages = p. 52–53 | year = 1996 }}</ref>

=== Iranian Constitutional Revolution ===

The Dashnaktsutiun held a meeting on [[April 26]], [[1907]], dubbed the Fourth General Congress, at which ARF leaders such as [[Aram Manougian]], [[Hamo Ohanjanyan]] and [[Stepan Stepanian]] discussed their engagement in the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]].<ref name="Early Dashnaktsutiun role in Iranian Constitutional Revolution">{{cite book |first = Houri | last = Berberian | title = Armenians and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1911 | publisher = Westview Press | pages = p. 116–117 | year = 2001 | id=ISBN 0813338174 }}</ref> They established that the movement was one that had political, ideological and economic components and thus were aimed at the establishment of law and order, human rights and the interests of all working people.

[[Image:Yeprem khan.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Yeprem Khan]] was a revolutionary leader of [[Iran]].]]

From 1907 to 1908, during the time when the Young Turks came to power in the Ottoman Empire, Armenians from the [[Caucasus]], [[Western Armenia]], and [[Iran]] started to collaborate with Iranian constitutionalists and revolutionaries.<ref name="Early Dashnaktsutiun role in Iranian Constitutional Revolution">{{cite book | last = Berberian | first = Houri | title = Armenians and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1911 | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2001 | pages = p. 116–117 | id=ISBN 0813338174 }}</ref> Political parties, notably the Dashnaktsutiun, wanted to influence the direction of the revolution towards greater democracy and to safeguard gains already achieved. The Dashnak contribution to the fight was mostly military, as it sent some of its well known fedayees to Iran after the guerrilla campaign in the Ottoman Empire ended with the rise of the Young Turks.<ref name="Early Dashnaktsutiun role in Iranian Constitutional Revolution">{{cite book |first = Houri | last = Berberian | title = Armenians and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1911 | publisher = Westview Press | pages = p. 116–117 | year = 2001 | id=ISBN 0813338174 }}</ref> A notable ARF member already in Iran was [[Yeprem Khan]], who had established a branch of the party in the country.

===Democratic Republic of Armenia===
{{Main|Democratic Republic of Armenia}}

As a result of the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and [[Muslim]] leaders of the Caucasus united to create the [[Transcaucasian Federation]] in the winter of 1918. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] had drastic consequences for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia. The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to the proclamation of the Republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The negotiators for Armenia were from the ARF.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.hayastan.com/armenia/history/armenia/index10.php | title= Transcaucasian Federation|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>

With the collapse of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Armenians were left to fend for themselves as the Turkish army approached the capital of [[Yerevan]]. At first, fearing a major military defeat and massacre of the population of Armenia, the Dashnaks wanted to evacuate the city of Yerevan. Instead, the Military Council headed by Colonel Pirumian decided that they would not surrender and would confront the Turkish army.<ref name="Sardarapat">{{cite web | url= http://armenianhistory.info/thefirst.htm | title= The First Republic|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> The opposing armies met on [[May 28]] [[1918]], near [[Sardarapat]].

The creation of the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] (DRA) was proclaimed on the same day of the Battle of Sardarapat, and the ARF became the ruling party. However, the new state was devastated, with a dislocated economy, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and a mostly starving population.<ref name="Sardarapat">{{cite web | url= http://armenianhistory.info/thefirst.htm | title= The First Republic|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>  

The ARF, led by [[Andranik Toros Ozanian|"Zoravar" Andranik]], tried several times to seize [[Shusha]] (known as Shushi by Armenians), a city in Karabakh. Just before the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed, Andranik was on the way from [[Zangezur]] to Shusha, to control the main city of Karabakh. Andranik's forces got within {{convert|26|mi|km|0}} of the city when the First World War ended, and Turkey, along with [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], surrendered to the [[Allies]].<ref name="Pre-Soviet history of Karabakh">{{cite web | url= http://www.cilicia.com/armo19i.html |title= Pre-Soviet history of Karabakh|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref> British forces ordered [[Andranik Toros Ozanian|Andranik]] to stop all military advances, assuring him that the conflict would be solved with the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. Andranik, not wanting to antagonize the British, retreated to Gorin, [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur]].<ref name="Pre-Soviet history of Karabakh"/>

The Armenian Revolutionary Federation had a strong presence in the DRA government. Most of the important government posts, such as prime minister, defence minister and interior minister were controlled by its members. Despite their tight grip on power, the ARF was unable to stop the impending [[Communist]] invasion from the north, which culminated with a Soviet takeover in 1920.<ref name="ARF.am"/> The ARF was banned, its leaders exiled, and many of its members dispersed to other parts of the world.<ref name="ARF.am"/>

== Exile ==
[[Image:ArmenianDiaspora.png|thumb|300px|The ARF established branches in the [[Armenian diaspora]].]]
{{See also|Armenian diaspora}}

After the communists took over the short-lived Democratic Republic of Armenia and ARF leaders were exiled, the Dashnaks moved their base of operations to where the [[Armenian diaspora]] had settled. With the large influx of Armenian refugees in the [[Levant]], the ARF established a strong political structure in [[Lebanon]] and to a lesser extent, [[Syria]]. From 1921 to 1990, the Dashnaktsutiun established political structures in more than 200 states including the [[United States|USA]], where another large influx of Armenians settled.<ref name="AZG Armenian Daily"/> 

With political and geographic division came religious division. One part of the Armenian Church claimed it wanted to be separate from the head, whose seat was in [[Echmiadzin]], [[Armenian SSR]]. Some Armenians in the US thought [[Moscow]] tried to use the Armenian Church to promote Communists' ideas outside the country. The Armenian Church thus separated into two branches, Echmiadzin and Cilician, and started to operate separately. In the US, Echmiadzin branch churches of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] would not admit members of the ARF. This was one of the reasons why the ARF discouraged people from attending these churches and brought the representatives from a different wing of the church, the Armenian [[Catholicate]] of [[Cilicia]], from Lebanon to the US.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.axcessnews.com/index.php/articles/show/id/11419| title=Soviet background separates two Armenian churches in US|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> In 1933, Dashnaks were suspects in the assassination of Armenian [[archbishop]] [[Levon Tourian]] in [[New York City]]. Prior to his murder, the archbishop had been accused of being exclusively pro-Soviet by the ARF.<ref>{{cite book |first = Touraj & Sanjyot | last = Atabaki & Mehendale | title = Central Asia And The Caucasus: Transnationalism And Diaspora | publisher = Routledge (UK) | pages = p. 136 | year = 2005 | id = ISBN 0415332605 }}</ref> However, the ARF itself was legally exonerated from any direct complicity in the assassination.<ref>{{cite book |first = Richard G. | last = Hovannisian | title = The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | pages = p. 416 | year = 1997 | id = ISBN 0312101686 }}</ref>

During the 1950s, tensions arose between the ARF and Armenian SSR. The death of [[Catholicos]] Garegin of the [[Holy See of Cilicia]] prompted a struggle for succession. The National Ecclesiastic Assembly, which was largely influenced by the ARF, elected [[Zareh of Aleppo]]. This decision was rejected by the Echmiadzin-based [[Catholicos of All Armenians]], the anti-ARF coalition, and Soviet Armenian authorities. Zareh extended his administrative authority over a large part of the Armenian diaspora, furthering the rift that had already been created by his election.<ref name="Modern Armenian history">{{cite book |first = Richard G. | last = Hovannisian | title = The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | pages = p. 418 | year = 1997 | id = ISBN 0312101686 }}</ref> This event split the large [[Armenians of Lebanon|Armenian community of Lebanon]], creating sporadic clashes between the supporters of Zareh and those who opposed his election.<ref name="Modern Armenian history">{{cite book |first = Richard G. | last = Hovannisian | title = The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | pages = p. 418 | year = 1997 | id = ISBN 0312101686 }}</ref>

Religious conflict was part of a greater conflict that raged between the two "camps" of the Armenian diaspora. The ARF still resented the fact that they were ousted from Armenia after the [[Red Army]] took control, and the ARF leaders supported the creation of a "Free, Independent, and United Armenia", free from both Soviet and Turkish hegemony. The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and [[Ramgavar Party]], the main rivals of the ARF, supported the newly established Soviet rule in Armenia.<ref name="Modern Armenian history">{{cite book |first = Richard | last = Hovannisian | title = The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | pages = p. 418 | year = 2005 | id = ISBN 0312101686 }}</ref>

=== Armenian Revolutionary Federation In Lebanon ===

{{Politics of Lebanon}}

From 1923 to 1958, conflicts erupted among Armenian political parties struggling to dominate and organize the diaspora. In 1926, a struggle between committees of the ARF and Hunchakian parties for control of the newly established shanty-town of [[Bourj Hammoud]] in Lebanon led to the assassination of ARF member Vahan Vartabedian. As retaliation for the murder, Hunchakian members Mihran Aghazarian and S. Dekhrouhi were assassinated in 1929 and 1931 respectively.<ref>{{cite book |first = Leonard | last = Weinberg | title = Political parties and terrorist groups | publisher = Routledge (UK) | pages = p. 19 | id = ISBN 0714634913 }}</ref> In 1956, when Bishop Zareh was consecrated Catholicos of Cilicia, the Catholicos of Echmiadzin refused to recognize his authority. This controversy polarized the Armenian community of Lebanon. As a result, in the context of the [[Lebanon crisis of 1958|Lebanese civil strife of 1958]], an armed conflict erupted between supporters (the ARF) and opponents (Hunchakians, Ramgavars) of Zareh.<ref name="Modern Armenian history">{{cite book |first = Richard | last = Hovannisian | title = The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | pages = p. 418 | year = 2005 | id = ISBN 0312101686 }}</ref> 

Prior to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975–90, the party was closely allied to the [[Kataeb Party (Lebanon)|Phalangist Party]] of [[Pierre Gemayel]] and generally ran joint tickets with the Phalangists, especially in [[Beirut]] constituencies with large Armenian populations.<ref name="Armenians and Lebanon">{{cite book |first = Division | last = Federal Research | title = Lebanon a Country Study | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | pages = p. 185 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1419129430 }}</ref> The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to play an active role in the civil war, however, soured relations between the two parties, and the [[Lebanese Forces]] (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by [[Bachir Gemayel]], Pierre Gemayel's son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud.<ref name="Armenians and Lebanon">{{cite book |first = Division | last = Federal Research | title = Lebanon a Country Study | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | pages = p. 185 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1419129430 }}</ref> Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst of the Lebanese civil war, a shadowy guerrilla organization called [[Justice Commandos Against Armenian Genocide]] emerged and carried out a string of assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.<ref>{{cite book | last = Verluise | title = Armenia in Crisis: The 1988 Earthquake | publisher = Wayne State University
Press | pages = p. 143 | year = 1995 | id = ISBN 0814325270 }}</ref>

A major change occurred in the parliamentary election of 2000. Negotiations to form a joint ticket between the ARF and the [[Karama]] (Dignity) party of [[Rafik Hariri]] broke down over Hariri's insistence that all candidates elected on his list, including ARF candidates, would have to form a unified parliamentary block subsequently—a rarity in [[Politics of Lebanon|Lebanese politics]]. This would make the Armenian vote in the Chamber subservient to Hariri's wishes.<ref name="Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon">{{cite web | url= http://groong.usc.edu/ro/ro-20000907.html |title=Armenians and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref> In addition, Hariri refused the ARF proposal to choose an Armenian candidate for the sole seat allocated to Lebanon's [[Protestant]] community (many of whom are ethnically Armenian), insisting that the seat should go to an ally of his.<ref name="Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon"/> The ARF decided to go it alone, although other Armenian parties joined Hariri's list. In an unprecedented sweep, the Dignity movement and its allies captured 13 of Beirut's 19 seats, and the ARF was left with only 1 parliamentary seat, its worst result in many decades.<ref name="Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon"/> The ARF called for a boycott of the 2005 Beirut elections, disturbed that the four seats normally reserved for Beirut's large Armenian community had gone unopposed to Hariri's candidates.<ref name="2005 Beirut elections">{{cite web | url= http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/29/news/lebanon.php |title= Tashnag party boycotts.|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref>

Speculation arose that the Lebanese branch of the ARF had broken away from the main party's political ideology of socialism and embraced capitalism.<ref name="Armenians and Lebanon">{{cite book |first = Division | last = Federal Research | title = Lebanon a Country Study | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | pages = p. 185 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1419129430 }}</ref> Davit Lokian, a prominent ARF member and [[Minister of Agriculture]] of Armenia, denied these claims.<ref name="Davit Lokian interview">{{cite web | url= http://www.yerkir.am/eng/index.php?sub=interview&id=41 |title= Interview with Davit Lokian denying ARF Lebanon had embraced capitalism.|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref> The Dashnaktsutiun has an official newspaper in Lebanon known as the ''[[Aztag Daily Newspaper]]''.

[[Armenians of Lebanon|Ethnic Armenians]] are allocated 6 seats in Lebanon's 128-member [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]]. The Lebanese branch of the ARF has usually controlled a majority of the Armenian vote and won most of the ethnic Armenian seats in the National Assembly, although it currently holds 2 seats Mr.Hagop Pakradounian from Metn area and Mr. George Kasarji From Bekaa Valley area .<ref name="The Lebanon"/> It has generally avoided entanglement in sensitive domestic issues, usually supporting whatever government has been in power. However, the ARF harshly criticized the Lebanese government's decision in 2006 to invite the deployment of Turkish troops as part of the multilateral [[UN]] peacekeeping force.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/archive/69586.html |title= Armenians protest Turkish deployment in Lebanon | accessdate=2006-01-04}}</ref>

On [[August 5]], [[2007]], a by-election took place in the [[Metn]] district, which includes the predominantly Armenian area of Bourj Hammoud, to replace the slain anti-Syrian minister [[Pierre Amine Gemayel|Pierre Gemayel]]. The ARF decided to support [[Camille Khoury]], the candidate backed by opposition leader [[Michel Aoun]]'s [[Free Patriotic Movement]]. Camille Khoury faced off against Phalangist leader [[Amine Gemayel]] and subsequently won the seat.<ref name="2007 by-election I">{{cite web | url= http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2007/08/lebanon_polls_a_1.php |title= Lebanon polls: Armenians back pro-Syrian candidate to victory|accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref> The ARF's move shocked the Lebanese community; the fact that the Armenians voted for a candidate strongly allied with the pro-Syrian [[Hezbollah]] militants was the big surprise of the by-election.<ref name="2007 by-election I"/> Government supporters blamed Gemayel's loss on the Armenians. Amine Gemayel accused the ARF of cheating and called for the ballot in Bourj Hammoud to be cancelled.

=== Armenia ===
The ARF has always maintained its ideological commitment to "a Free, Independent, and United Armenia".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.arfshant.org/index.aspx?PAGEACTION=Home | title=ARF Shant Student Association|accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref> The term ''United Armenia'' refers to the borders of Armenia recognized by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] and outlined in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/versa/sevindex.html | title=Treaty of Sèvres|accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref> After Armenia fell under Soviet control in 1920, the ARF, spread throughout the Armenian diaspora, fought Soviet rule over Armenia and rallied in support of Armenian independence. It contributed to organizing a social and cultural framework aimed at preserving the Armenian identity.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.arf.am/English/ | title= Armenian Revolutionary Federation - Dashnaktsutiun |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> However, because of tight communist control, the ARF could not operate in the Armenian SSR as the political party remained banned until 1991. 

When independence was achieved in 1991, the ARF soon became one of the major and most active [[List of political parties in Armenia|political parties]], rivaled mainly by the [[Pan-Armenian National Movement]] (PANM). Subsequently, on [[December 28]], [[1994]], [[President of Armenia|President]] [[Levon Ter-Petrossian]] in a famous television speech banned the ARF, which was the nation's leading opposition party, along with ''[[Yerkir]],'' the country's largest daily newspaper.<ref name="ARF History"/> Ter-Petrossian introduced evidence that supposedly detailed a plot hatched by the ARF to engage in terrorism against his administration, endanger Armenia's national security and overthrow the government. Throughout the evening, government security forces arrested leading ARF figures, and police seized computers, fax machines, files and printing equipment from ARF offices. In addition to ''Yerkir'', government forces also closed several literary, women's, cultural, and youth publications.<ref name="ARF History">{{cite web | url= http://arf.am/English/history/004history.htm| title=ARF newspaper banned|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref> Thirty-one men, who would later be known as the "[[Drastamat Kanayan|Dro Group]]" (named after the Dro Committee, the group that was allegedly behind the plot), were arrested. 

Gerard Libaridyan, an historian and close adviser of Ter-Petrossian, collected and presented the evidence against the defendants. He later stated in an interview that he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion that the party was banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections.<ref>Interview in 2001 by Aram Abrahamyan on Horizon Armenian Programming.</ref> Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrossian fell from power and was replaced by [[Robert Kocharyan]], who was backed by the Dashnaks.<ref name="ARF.am"/>

As of 2007, the ARF is not part of but has a cooperation agreement in place with the governing coalition, comprised of two parties in the government [[Coalition government|coalition]], the [[Republican Party (Armenia)|Republican Party]] and [[Prosperous Armenia]] Party. The [[Country of Law]] party was also a member of the governing coalition until it pulled out in May 2006. With 16 of the 131 seats in the [[National Assembly of Armenia]], the Armenian Revolutionary Federation is the major socialist party in Armenia and the third-largest party in parliament.

In addition to its parliamentary seats, the following governmental ministries are also headed by ARF members: Ministry of Agriculture, Davit Lokian;<ref name=>{{cite web | url= http://www.gov.am/enversion/gov_staff_3/kazm_sep6.htm| title=Davit Lokyan profile at Armenian Government website|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref> Ministry of Education and Science, Levon Mkrtchian;<ref name=>{{cite web | url= http://www.gov.am/enversion/gov_staff_3/kazm_sep8.htm| title=Levon Mkrtchian profile at Armenian Government website|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref> Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Aghvan Vardanian;<ref name=>{{cite web | url= http://www.gov.am/enversion/gov_staff_3/kazm_sep11.htm| title=Aghvan Vardanian profile at Armenian Government website|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref> Ministry of Healthcare, Norair Davidian.<ref name=>{{cite web | url= http://www.gov.am/enversion/gov_staff_3/kazm_sep1.htm| title=Norair Davidian profile at Armenian Government website|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref> On [[July 13]], [[2007]], the [[ARF History Museum]] was inaugurated in Yerevan, displaying the history of the party and of its notable members.

In 2007, the ARF announced that it would nominate its own candidate to run for [[president of Armenia]] in the upcoming [[Armenian presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. In an innovation on 2007 November 24 and 25, the ARF conducted a [[non-binding]] Armenia-wide [[primary election]]. They invited the public to vote to advise the party which of two candidates Vahan Hovhannisyan and Aram Rustamian they should formally nominate for president of Armenia in the subsequent official election. What characterized it as a primary instead of a standard [[opinion poll]] was that the public knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 people voted in make-shift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot.<ref>[http://www.a1plus.am/en/?page=issue&iid=55090 "ARFD Nominates Vahan Hovhannissian."] ''A1+''. 30 November 2007. 18 December 2007.</ref>

== Political philosophy and goals ==

[[Image:Armenia (Sevres).jpg|280px|thumb|right|The Armenian state demanded by the ARF included lands to be ceded by each country created by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (image dated during existence of the Soviet Union).]]

The principal founders of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation were socialists, and [[Marxism|Marxist]] elements were omnipresent in the introductory section of the party's first program written by [[Rosdom]], entitled "General Theory".<ref name="ARF History (1)">{{cite web | url= http://www.arf.am/English/history/001history.htm| title=ARF history|accessdate=2006-01-29}}</ref> The ARF first set down its ideological and political goals during the [[Abdul Hamid II|Hamidian regime]]. It denounced the Ottoman regime and the unbearable conditions of life for its Armenians and advocated changing the regime in power and securing more rights through revolution and armed struggle. The ARF had and still has [[socialism]] within its [[political philosophy]]. Its program expresses the entire, multifaceted make-up of the Armenian revolutionary movement, including its national-liberation, political, and social-economic aspects.<ref name="ARF History (2)">{{cite web | url= http://www.arf.am/English/history/002history.htm| title=ARF history (2)|accessdate=2006-01-29}}</ref> 

Despite subsequent modifications, the above-mentioned principles and tendencies continue to characterize the ideological world of the Dashnaktsutiun, and its approach toward issues has remained unchanged. In recent decades, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation reasserted itself ideologically and reformulated the section of its program called "General Theory", adapting it to current concepts of socialism, democracy and rights of self-determination.<ref name="ARF History (2)">{{cite web | url= http://www.arf.am/English/history/002history.htm| title=ARF history|accessdate=2006-01-29}}</ref> Its goals are:

* Creation of a free, independent, and united Armenia. The borders of [[United Armenia]] shall include all territories designated as Armenia by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] as well as the regions of [[Artsakh]], [[Javakheti|Javakhk]], and [[Nakhichevan]] (See map).<ref name="ARF Shant Student Association">{{cite web | url= http://www.arfshant.org/index.aspx?PAGEACTION=Home| title=Goals of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref>

* International condemnation of the [[Armenian genocide|Genocide]] committed by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenians, return of the lands which are claimed to be occupied, and just reparations to the Armenian nation<ref name="ARF Shant Student Association"/>

* The gathering of worldwide expatriate Armenians on the lands of United Armenia.<ref name="ARF Shant Student Association"/>

* Strengthening Armenia's statehood, institutionalization of democracy and the rule of law, securing the people's economic well being, and establishment of social justice, and a democratic and socialistic independent republic in Armenia<ref name="ARF Shant Student Association"/>

The ARF is often accused of having a present strategy that does not differ from the one used during the time of the Ottoman Empire.
