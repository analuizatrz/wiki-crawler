'''Crawley''' ({{Audio|en-uk-Crawley.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a town and [[local government district]] with [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough status]] in [[West Sussex]], [[England]]. It is {{convert|28|mi|km|0|lk=on}} south of [[London]], {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} north of [[Brighton and Hove]], and {{convert|32|mi|km|0}} northeast of the county town of [[Chichester]], covers an area of {{convert|17.36|sqmi|sqkm|2|lk=on}} and had a population of 99,744 people at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]]. It is bordered by the West Sussex [[local authority|local authority area]]s of [[Mid Sussex]] and [[Horsham (district)|Horsham]] districts, and the [[Mole Valley]] and [[Tandridge]] districts and the [[Reigate and Banstead|Borough of Reigate and Banstead]] in the county of [[Surrey]].

Although the area was inhabited [[Three-age system|from the Stone Age onwards]], and was a centre of iron-making in Roman times, Crawley developed slowly as a market town until the [[Second World War]].  The area was designated as the site of one of the "new towns" proposed by the [[New Towns Act 1946]], however, and rapid development ensued — with the growth of nearby [[Gatwick Airport]] adding to this.

The town comprises 13 planned "neighbourhoods" (residential areas), separated by main roads and railway lines, and based around the core of the old market town.  The nearby communities of [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]], [[Pound Hill, Crawley|Pound Hill]] and [[Three Bridges]] were absorbed into the new town.  Some expansion is currently planned for the west and northwest boundaries of the town, in co-operation with [[Horsham]] District Council.<ref name="wnw">{{Cite web|url=http://194.201.99.228/Index.htm|title=West and North West of Crawley|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Horsham District Council|year=2007|author=Horsham District Council & Crawley Borough Council|work=West and North West of Crawley website}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
Crawley has its origins in [[Stone Age]] settlements some 7,000 years ago.<ref name="cbchist">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=221&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN|title=A Brief History of Crawley|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref> Evidence of habitation in the region includes [[Neolithic]] tools, [[Roman Britain|Roman]] ironworks and even a [[Bronze Age]] sword.<ref name="cole">{{cite book | title=Crawley: A History & Celebration| last=Cole| first=Belinda| date=2004| publisher=Frith Book Company Ltd| location=Salisbury| id=1904938191}}</ref>

There is some evidence that the area was settled in the [[Mesolithic]] period, with examples of locally-manufactured flints of the [[Horsham Culture]] type found to the south-west of the town. Evidence also exists of [[Bronze Age]] burial mounds just to the south of the town, suggesting some habitation in that period. Other finds suggest continued habitation through Roman times.<ref name="cole"/> 

In the 5th century, Saxon settlers gave the area its name of Crow's Leah — meaning a crow-infested clearing, or Crow's Wood<ref name="cole"/> — although the name changed considerably over time, with the present spelling arriving by the early 14th century.<ref name="cbchist"/> By this time, nearby settlements were more established, with the Saxon church at [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]] dating from around 1000.

In the [[Domesday Book]], while the town itself is not mentioned, both [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]] and [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]] are recorded. The first written record of Crawley is found in the granting of a right to hold a market in the town in 1202. Issued by [[King John]], this allowed for a weekly market on Wednesdays.<ref name="miscellany">{{cite book | title=Crawley: An Illustrated Miscellany| last=Cole| first=Belinda ''(text adapted from original material)''| date=2004| publisher=Frith Book Company Ltd| location=Salisbury| id=1904938744}}</ref> As time passed, the importance of the town grew slowly, boosted in the 18th century by the popularity of [[Brighton]]; Crawley prospered as a coaching halt offering an almost hourly service to Brighton and London.<ref name="cole"/><ref name="pigot">{{cite book | title=Pigot's Directory of Sussex| url=http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/pageviewer.asp?pnum=31&zoom=-r%2B100&dn=WSC13002tif&fn=| date=1839| pages=681| publisher=Pigot| location=London & Manchester| id=WSC13002 }}</ref>  The George, a [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] house dating from the 15th century, expanded over the years to take over adjacent buildings and become a large coaching inn.  The increase in Brighton's popularity, and Crawley's location halfway between it and London, meant that an annexe had to be built in the middle of the wide High Street; this survived until the 1930s.<ref name="George">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN&ssDocName=INT009956|title=Crawley High Street|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>  Now known as the George Hotel, it retains many original features, including an iron [[Fireplace#Accessories|fireback]], and has conference facilities and 84 bedrooms.<ref name="townwalk">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/otherdocs/int037605.pdf|title=Crawley Town Walk|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref><ref name="Hotel">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatwickgeorgehotel.com/overview.htm|title=The George Hotel|accessdate=2007-08-03||year=2007|work=The George Hotel website}}</ref>

[[Image:Crawley - St John the Baptist Church.JPG|thumb|right|St John the Baptist church from the east.]]
Crawley's oldest church is St John the Baptist, between the High Street and the Broadway.  It has 13th century origins,<ref name="StJB">{{Cite web|url=http://www.acny.org.uk/venue.php?V=4860|title=Diocese of Chichester: St John the Baptist, Crawley|accessdate=2007-09-13|publisher=Oxford Diocesan Publications Ltd|year=2007|work=A Church Near You website}}</ref> but there has been much rebuilding (especially in the 19th century) and the oldest part now remaining is the south wall of the [[nave]], which is believed to be 14th century.  The church has a [[Bell tower|tower]] (originally 15th century, but rebuilt in 1804) containing two bells cast in 1742.<ref name="MoreStJB">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=56939#s3|title=Parishes: Crawley|accessdate=2007-09-13|publisher=British History Online|year=1940|author=Hudson, T.P. (Ed)|work=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7: The Rape of Lewes}}</ref>

===Railway age and Victorian era===
The railways first came to Crawley by way of the [[Brighton Main Line]] passing through a station at [[Three Bridges]] in the summer of 1841. At first this station was known as East Crawley,<ref name="eastcrawley">{{Cite web|url=http://www.maidenbower.org.uk/history/palmerhistory.pdf|title=A brief history of Maidenbower|accessdate=2007-09-06|author=David Palmer|publisher=Stuart Cummings|year=2003|work=Maidenbower Village website}}</ref> but the opening of the [[Arun Valley Line|Horsham branch]] in 1848 allowed a new [[Crawley railway station]] to be built more centrally, at the southern end of the High Street. A line to [[East Grinstead railway station|East Grinstead]] was opened in 1855. By this stage, Three Bridges was becoming the hub of transport in the area, with one-quarter of its population being employed in railway jobs by 1861 (mainly at the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]]'s railway works near the station);<ref name="fredgray">
{{cite book |last=Gray (ed.) |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Crawley: Old Town, New Town |origdate= |origyear=1983 |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition=Centre for Continuing Education, University of Sussex |series=Paper No. 18 |date= |year= |month= |publisher=University of Sussex |location=Falmer |language= |isbn=0-904212-21-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=8–40 |chapter=Crawley in the Twentieth Century |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> but once the line reached Crawley itself, transport for both people and commodities was much improved. The locally-famous Longley family set up business alongside the line in 1881; at this time, the town experienced a major expansion in housebuilding, including the creation of an area known as "New Town" (unrelated to the postwar developments) around the railway [[level crossing]] and down the Brighton Road.<ref name="cole"/><ref name="fredgray"/>

During the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period the town continued to grow, with considerable building in the [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]] area and some development south of the railway in what is now [[Southgate, Crawley|Southgate]]. In 1891, a racecourse was opened at Gatwick, with the [[Grand National]] being held there during the years of the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name="cbchist"/>

As the 20th century arrived, considerable development continued around the town centre. Additionally, land near the racecourse was developed as an airfield, opening in 1930. The airport continued as a private concern until the [[World War II|Second World War]] when it was claimed by the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name="cbchist"/>  Around this time, many of the large 19th century [[Estate (house)|country estates]] in the area, with their [[mansion]]s and associated grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land which attracted haphazard housing development and small farms.<ref name="fredgray"/>

By the [[First World War]], Crawley had matured into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area as well as its own population and those passing through on the [[A23 road|A23]] London–Brighton road; three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50 years.<ref name="fredgray"/>

===New Town===
====Plans====
[[Image:Woodfield Road, Northgate.JPG|thumb|right|A typical residential road: Woodfield Road in the Northgate neighbourhood.]]

The area around Crawley was officially identified as a suitable location for a [[New Town]] in May 1946, but not officially designated as such until [[9 January]] [[1947]]. At the time of designation, the 5,920 acres (2,395 hectares) of land set aside for the new town were split across the county borders between [[East Sussex]], [[West Sussex]] and [[Surrey]]. Architect [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]] was appointed as the chairman of the Development Corporation for the town. A court challenge to the designation order meant that plans were not officially confirmed until December 1947. By this time, an initial plan for the development of the area had been drawn up by planner [[Anthony Minoprio]].<ref name="vic">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18414|title=Crawley New Town|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=British History Online|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P.

Work began almost immediately, preparing the groundwork for the expansion of the town, with a full master plan in place by 1949. This plan saw an extension in the planned population of the town from 40,000 to 50,000, with residential properties shared between 9 neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, and a separate industrial area to the north of the town.<ref name="vic"/> The plans for the neighbourhoods included mainly 3-bedroom family homes, with a number of smaller and larger properties. Each neighbourhood was to be built around a centre which contained shops, a [[Church (building)|church]], a [[public house]], a [[primary school]] and a [[community centre]].<ref name="cbc"/> [[Secondary education]] was to be provided at three campuses across the town at [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield Green]], [[Three Bridges]] and [[Tilgate, Crawley|Tilgate]].<ref name="plan">{{cite journal | title=First proposed structure plan, 1947| journal=Nostalgia: A Crawley Observer Supplement| year=1995| issue=2| page=3}}</ref> Later, a fourth campus was added to the plans in [[Southgate, Crawley|Southgate]] for the building of [[Roman Catholic]] schools.<ref name="masterplan">{{Cite map|title=The Crawley Development Corporation's Master Plan for Crawley New Town|publisher=Crawley Development Corporation|year=1949}}</ref>

====Early years====
[[Image:Crawley - Queen's Square looking ENE.JPG|thumb|right|Queen's Square looking east-northeast.]]
Development began quickly in the town, although at first no town centre building was begun — the existing high street being used for shopping. Earliest progress was in [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]] with residents moving in during the late 1940s. In 1950 the town was visited by the then heir to the throne, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]], when she officially opened the [[Manor Royal, Crawley|Manor Royal]] industrial area. Work continued eastwards in the town, with building taking place in [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]], [[Northgate, Crawley|Northgate]], [[Three Bridges]], and then more widely in [[Langley Green, Crawley|Langley Green]], [[Pound Hill, Crawley|Pound Hill]] and [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]].<ref name="vic"/>

As early as 1956, it was clear that the original proposals for a population of 40,000 were insufficient to match the growth of the town, and so land at "Tilgate East" was allocated for housing use, eventually becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Furnace Green, Crawley|Furnace Green]].<ref name="vic"/>

Developments in the town centre saw the planning of extended shopping facilities to the east of the existing high street. The first stage to open was The Broadwalk in 1954, following by the official opening of the Queen's Square development by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] in 1958. Crawley railway station was moved eastwards towards the new development.<ref name="vic"/>

The provision of public services was made in co-operation with the local authorities, who oversaw the opening of a fire station in 1958, the telephone exchange, police station and town centre health clinic in 1961 and the ambulance station in 1963. Plans for a new hospital on land at the Hawth were abandoned, however, and the hospital was redeveloped on its existing site.<ref name="vic"/>  Gas was initially supplied by pipelines from  [[Croydon]], 20 miles (32 km) away, while the town's water supply came from the [[Weir Wood]] reservoir south of East Grinstead.<ref name="oldphotos">

By April 1960, when Thomas Bennett made his last presentation as chairman of the Development Corporation, the town's population had reached 51,700; 2,289,000 ft² (212,650 m²) of factory and other industrial space had been provided; 21,800 people were employed, with nearly 60% of jobs being in manufacturing industry; and only seventy people were registered as unemployed.  The Corporation had built 10,254 houses, with around 1,500 more being constructed by private builders.  The Corporation permitted residents to buy their houses, and 440 householders had chosen to do so by April 1960.<ref name="13years"/>

====Subsequent expansion====
With the success of early developments, a new plan was put forward by West Sussex County Council in 1961. This proposed new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Plans were drawn up for Broadfield in the late 1960s, with some development in place by the early 1970s. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development here was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than previous ones, with a combined proposed population of 23,000. Work also took place in the area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.<ref name="vicdates"/>

As early as 1980, the council identified land at Maidenbower as being suitable for further expansion of the town to accommodate the growing population, and work began in 1986. However, all of the development at Maidenbower was undertaken privately, unlike the previous developments which had included largely council-owned accommodation.<ref name="vicdates"/>

In 1999, plans were in place to develop a fourteenth neighbourhood on land at Tinsley Green to the northeast of the existing town. However, these were halted due to proposals for possible expansion at [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick Airport]].<ref name="nesector">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=PR1966&ssTargetNodeId=99|title=Council wins fight against new neighbourhood|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007-05-15|author=Janet Treagus|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref> Discussions are now underway in co-operation with [[Horsham]] District Council for possible location of new housing on Crawley's western fringes.<ref name="wnw"/>

==Governance==
[[Image:Crawley Town Hall 01.JPG|thumb|right|Crawley Town Hall, on The Boulevard in the town centre.]]
Crawley Urban District Council was formed in April 1956. It was formed from that part of the Horsham Rural District which fell within the new town's area. Changes under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] saw the district formed as a borough in April 1974, gaining a mayor for the first time. 

The borough was awarded a [[coat of arms]] later in 1974. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town's location at the meeting point of north-south and east-west roads. The shield also features nine [[martlet]]s representing both the county of [[Sussex]] and the new town's original nine neighbourhoods. Supporters, of an eagle and a winged lion, relate to the significance of the airport to the locality. The motto featured is ''I Grow and I Rejoice''.<ref name="arms">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010340&ssTargetNodeId=425&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN|title=Coat of Arms|accessdate=2007-09-01|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>

Initially the district (and then borough) council worked with the [[Commission for the New Towns]] on many aspects of development, but in 1978, many of the commission's assets, such as housing and parks, were surrendered to the local authority. The authority's boundaries were extended in 1983 to allow for increasing development in Bewbush and Broadfield.<ref name="guide">{{cite book | title=Crawley: Official Guide| last=Crawley Borough Council| date=1997| publisher=Local Authority Publishing Co. Ltd.| location=Wallington}}</ref>

The borough remains part of the local two-tier arrangements, with services shared with West Sussex County Council. The authority is divided into 15 wards, each of which is represented by two or three local councillors, forming a total council of 37 members. Most wards are coterminous with the borough's neighbourhoods, but two neighbourhoods are divided: Broadfield into North and South wards, and Pound Hill into "Pound Hill North" and "Pound Hill South and Worth". The council is elected in thirds.<ref name="bcfe">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk/files/dms/Crawley_5885-5489__E__.pdf|title=Final recommendations on the future electoral arrangements for Crawley in West Sussex|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=The Boundary Committee for England|year=2002|format=PDF}}</ref> 

[[2007|As of the 2007]] local elections, the authority is [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-controlled, with seats allocated as follows:

The party gained control in May 2006 for the first time since the creation of the borough.

==Geography==
Crawley lies in the [[Weald]] between the [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]]. Two geological beds of [[sedimentary rock]]s meet in the town, with the eastern neighbourhoods and the town centre lying largely on [[Hastings Sand]], while the bulk of the town to the north and west is based on the [[Weald Clay]].<ref name="bgs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/magazine/geology/home.html?|title=Geology of Britain|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=British Geological Survey|year=2007|work=British Geological Survey website}}</ref>  The town has no major waterways, although a number of smaller brooks and streams are tributaries for the [[River Mole, Surrey|River Mole]] which rises near [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick Airport]] and runs northwards to the [[River Thames]]. There are several lakes at [[Tilgate Park, Crawley|Tilgate Park]], and a mill pond at Ifield, which was stopped to feed the Ifield Mill.<ref name="mill">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010149|title=Ifield Mill Pond|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>  The land to the south of the town, in the then much extended [[Tilgate Forest]], saw the discovery of the first bone of an [[Iguanodon]] in 1822, near [[Cuckfield]].<ref name="dino">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dinohunters.com/Iguanodon/discovery.htm|title=Mantell’s Discovery of Iguanodon|accessdate=2007-08-10|year=2007|work=A History of Dinosaur Hunting and Reconstruction}}</ref>

===Climate===
Crawley has a [[temperate]] climate in common with most areas of Great Britain: its [[Koppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|Koppen climate classification]] is ''Cfb''.  Its mean annual temperature of 9.6 [[Celsius|°C]] is similar to that experienced throughout the Weald, and slightly cooler than nearby areas such as the Sussex coast and Greater London.<ref name="temperature">{{cite web|year = 2001|url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif|title = Mean Temperature Annual Average|publisher = [[Met Office]]|accessdate = 2007-08-22}}</ref>  Rainfall is considerably below England's average (1971–2000) level of 838 mm, and every month is drier overall than the England average.<ref name="rainmean">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/england.html|title=Met Office: averages 1971–2000|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=Met Office|year=2007|work=Met Office website}}</ref>

[[Image:Shopping Parade, Southgate.JPG|thumb|right|The Southgate neighbourhood's parade of shops.]]
[[Image:Crawley Neighbourhoods with Colours.png|thumb|right|Neighbourhoods of Crawley, identified in the table below.]]
There are 13 residential neighbourhoods, each consisting of a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows.  The clay soil beneath Crawley made high-rise "tower block" developments of flats relatively unattractive due to the cost of stabilising the ground.  Each neighbourhood is based around a shopping parade, community centre and church, with schools and areas of open space also available.  The Development Corporation's intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to basic needs, with the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements, and the number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood,<ref name="econhist">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18418|title=Crawley New Town: Economic History|accessdate=2007-07-03|publisher=British History Online|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P.

There are also some areas which are not neighbourhoods but which are closely associated with Crawley:
*The [[Manor Royal, Crawley|Manor Royal]] industrial estate is in the north of the town.  Although it is part of the Northgate ward, it is also allocated a colour: its streets feature the word "INDUSTRIAL" on a black background.
*[[Gatwick Airport]] was built on the site of a manor house, Gatwick Manor, which was situated close to the village of [[Lowfield Heath]].  Most of the village was demolished when the airport expanded, but some buildings, including St Michael's church,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diochi.org.uk/cgi-bin/showparishes3.pl?clergycode=BH0215|title=The Diocese of Chichester: St Michael, Lowfield Heath|accessdate=2007-09-13|publisher=The Bishop’s Council of the Diocese of Chichester|year=2007|}}</ref> remain.  These lie on the airport's southern boundary, between the perimeter road and the A23 close to Manor Royal.  In the picture, the road to the left, ''Old Brighton Road South'', is truncated abruptly at the airport boundary, a short distance from the runway.
*[[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]] was originally a village with its own civil parish, lying just beyond the eastern edge of the Crawley urban area and borough boundary;<ref>{{cite map |publisher= Ordnance Survey|title= Sheet 187: Dorking, Reigate and Crawley|url= |edition= |year= 1980|cartography= |scale= 1:50,000|series= Landranger Series of Great Britain |page= |section= |accessdate=|isbn= |id= }}</ref> but development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the borough boundary has been extended to include the whole of the village.  The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, and it is part of the Mid Sussex district.

Before the new town was developed, Crawley traded as a traditional market town. Plans were soon in place to develop the town as a centre for manufacturing, and light engineering, with a dedicated and purpose-built industrial zone.<ref name="ind">{{cite book | title=''Working for Success'' in Crawley: Official Guide| pages=41-43| publisher=Crawley Borough Council}}</ref> In time, this industry developed to encompass newer technologies, and the rapid growth of Gatwick Airport provided further opportunities. The significance of the airport in terms of local employment and enterprise is recognised in the formation of the [[Gatwick Diamond]] partnership which recognises the airport as a hub of employment and economic growth.<ref name="gatdiamond">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatwickdiamond.co.uk/|title=The Gatwick Diamond|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=West Sussex Economic Partnership|year=2007|work=Gatwick Diamond website}}</ref>

===Manufacturing industry===
By the time the new town was developed, Crawley was already a modest industrial centre.  Building was an important trade, with 800 people being employed by building and joinery firms — two, Longley's and Cook's, were large enough to have their own factories.<ref name="fredgray"/>  In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing, with light and precision engineering and aircraft repair being the main industries.  Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.<ref name="fredgray"/><ref name="econhist"/>

Industrial development had to take place relatively early in the life of the new town because part of the Corporation's remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged London, and industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community where people could settle.<ref name="NTA1946"/>  The Development Corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base, with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town.

[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]] (later Queen Elizabeth II) opened the first part of the industrial area on [[25 January]] [[1950]];<ref name="miscellany"/> its main road was named Manor Royal, and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate.<ref name="econhist"/>  

The Corporation stipulated that several different [[Secondary sector of economic activity|manufacturing industries]] should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate.  It did not seek to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms to build their own premises or to rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.<ref name="econhist"/><ref name="fredgray"/>

Despite the lack of direct incentives, many firms applied to move to the Manor Royal estate: it was considered such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken.  One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000.<ref name="econhist"/>  By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500.  Nearly 20,000 were employed in 105 "new" firms in 1978.<ref name="econhist"/><ref name="fredgray"/>

===Service industry and commerce===
While most of the new jobs created in the new town's early years were in manufacturing, the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|tertiary sector]] developed strongly from the 1960s onwards.  The Manor Royal estate, with its space, proximity to Gatwick and good transport links, attracted airport-related services such as logistics, catering, distribution and warehousing; and the Corporation and private companies built many offices throughout the town.  Office floorspace in the town increased from 55,000 ft² (5,100 m²) in 1965 to a conservative estimate of 453,000 ft² (42,000 m²) in 1984;<ref name="econhist"/> this figure has risen further since then.  Major office developments during these years included premises for the [[Natwest|Westminster Bank]] (later part of NatWest), [[British Caledonian]], and [[Paymaster-General|The Office of the Paymaster-General]] — a government ministry within the remit of [[HM Treasury]].<ref name="econhist"/>  The five-storey Overline House above the railway station, completed in 1968, is used by Crawley's [[NHS Primary Care Trust]] and various other companies.<ref name="nhs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/Trust.aspx?id=5P6&v=6|title=NHS: West Sussex PCT|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=Department of Health|year=2007|work=NHS Choices: West Sussex PCT (list of sites)}}</ref><ref name="otheroverlinecos">{{Cite web|url=http://www.locallife.co.uk/crawley/jobagencies3.asp|title=Locallife Crawley|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=Locallife Ltd|year=2007|work=Locallife Crawley: Business directory}}</ref>

Even before the new town was planned, Crawley had some local importance as a retail centre: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948,<ref name="fredgray"/> 99 of which were on the High Street.<ref name="econhist"/>  Its significance grew as the Corporation developed the town centre as a major shopping venue: 150 new shops were provided on previously mostly undeveloped land to the east of the High Street and north of the railway line.<ref name="NTA1946"/>  Its main intention was to integrate the town centre development closely with the surrounding residential neighbourhoods, so that relatively few (and basic) shops would be required in the neighbourhoods themselves, and to maintain the character and ambience of the old High Street.<ref name="13years"/><ref name="NTA1946"/>

Early new town residents relied on the existing shopping facilities until the building of The Broadwalk in 1954, with 23 shops, and then the Queen's Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s.<ref name="vicdates"/>.  Queen's Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name="fredgray"/>  The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.

Developments between the 1960s and the 1980s included the opening of large branches of [[Tesco]] (Britain's largest at the time), [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Marks & Spencer]]; and an expansion southeastwards from Queen's Square, providing a pedestrianised link (The Martlets) and several large shop units — although the original plans of 1975 were scaled back.<ref name="econhist"/>  The remaining land between this area and the railway line was sold for private development by 1982;<ref name="econhist"/> this came to fruition in 1992, when a 450,000 ft² (41,800 m²)<ref name="CMsize">{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/433|title=Propertymall.com: Crawley, County Mall Shopping Centre|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=MaxiMalls.com Ltd|year=2007|work=www.propertymall.com}}</ref> shopping centre named County Mall was opened.<ref name="mall">{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=3047252|title=The magnetic North|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Property Week|year=2005-02-25|author=Christine Ease|work=www.propertyweek.com}}</ref> The mall is home to major retailers such as [[Debenhams]], [[Alliance Boots|Boots]], [[W H Smith]] and [[Bhs|British Home Stores]] as well as over 80 smaller outlets.<ref name="shops">{{Cite web|url=http://www.standardlifeweb.co.uk/retailerslist.php?user=countymall&all=true|title=Shopping|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Standard Life Property|year=2007|work=www.countymall.co.uk}}</ref>  The town's main bus station was redesigned, roads including the main A2220 Haslett Avenue were rerouted, and some buildings at the south end of The Martlets were demolished to accommodate the mall.

There are plans to expand Crawley's central shopping area, on to land currently occupied by the Town Hall and office buildings.

==Transport==
Crawley's early development as a market town was helped by its location on the London–Brighton [[turnpike]].  The area was joined to the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway network]] in the mid-19th century; and since the creation of the new town, there have been major road upgrades (including a [[motorway]] link), a [[guided bus]] transit system and the establishment of an [[airport]] which has become one of Britain's largest and busiest.

===Road===
[[Image:028602 eed83833.jpg|thumb|right|The M23 motorway between Junctions 9 and 10.]]

The London–Brighton turnpike ran through the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road.  When Britain's major roads were classified by the British government's Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://euclid.colorado.edu/~rmg/roads/numbering.html#history|title= Major Roads of Great Britain – a brief history of the numbering system|accessdate=2007-07-31 |format= |work= }}</ref> it was given the number '''[[A23 road|A23]]'''.  This was bypassed first by a new dual carriageway in 1939 (which forms the A23's current route through the town), and then later to the east side of the town by the '''[[M23 motorway]]''', which was opened in 1975.  This connects London's orbital motorway, the [[M25 motorway|M25]], to the A23 at [[Pease Pottage]], at the southern edge of Crawley's built-up area.  The original single-carriageway road A23 is now numbered the '''A2219'''.  

As well as the junction (11) at Pease Pottage, where the motorway ends, the M23 has junctions in the Crawley area at Maidenbower (10A) and the '''A2011'''/'''[[A264 road|A264]]''' (10).  The A2011, another dual-carriageway, joins the A23 in West Green, and provides a link, via the '''A2004''', to the town centre.  The '''A2220''' follows the former route of the A264 through the town, linking the A23 directly to the A264 at [[Copthorne, West Sussex|Copthorne]], from where it then runs to [[East Grinstead]].

===Rail===
[[Image:Crawley Station 01 (07-07-2007).JPG|thumb|left|Crawley station, with five storeys of offices above the ticket office and concourse area.]]

The first railway line in the area was the [[Brighton Main Line]], which opened as far as [[Haywards Heath]] on [[12 July]] [[1841]].  It ran through Three Bridges, which was then a small village east of Crawley, and [[Three Bridges railway station|a station]] was built to serve it.

A line to [[Horsham]], now part of the [[Arun Valley Line]], was opened on [[14 February]] [[1848]], with [[Crawley railway station|a station]] being provided at Crawley from that date.  This was built next to the High Street.  A new station was constructed slightly to the east, in conjunction with the Overline House commercial development, and replaced the original station which closed on [[28 July]] [[1968]].  The ticket office and Up platform waiting areas form the ground floor of the office building.<ref>{{cite book |last= Body|first= Geoffrey|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= PSL Field Guide: Railways of the Southern Region|year= 1984|publisher= Patrick Stephens Ltd|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-85059-664-5|pages= page 75}}</ref>

[[Ifield railway station]] is also within the Crawley urban area.  Opened as ''Lyons Crossing Halt'' on [[1 June]] [[1907]] to serve the village of Ifield, it was soon renamed ''Ifield Halt'', dropping the "Halt" suffix in 1930.

Regular train services run to [[London Victoria station|London Victoria]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] stations, Gatwick Airport, [[Croydon]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Horsham]], [[Littlehampton]], [[Bognor Regis]], [[Chichester]] and [[Portsmouth]].  Three Bridges has direct links with Brighton.

===Bus and Fastway===
Early bus routes in the town were provided from services in London and Surrey. With the break up of the [[National Bus Company (UK)|National Bus Company]], local services were provided by [[London Country Bus Services|London Country]], later part of the [[Arriva]] group.
Since March 2001, the majority of local bus services in Crawley have been operated by [[Metrobus (Go-Ahead Group)|Metrobus]], following their acquisition of garaging from the Arriva group who ceased operations from Crawley at that time.<ref name="goahead">{{Cite web|url=http://www.go-ahead.com/Main.php?sFileName=NewsRelease.php&iNewsId=130&sYear=2001|title=Acquisition of Crawley Depot|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Go Ahead Group|year=2001|work=Go Ahead Group website}}</ref> The company operates local services between the neighbourhoods and town centre, as well as longer-distance routes to [[Horsham]], [[Redhill]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Worthing]] and [[Brighton]].<ref name="buses">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metrobus.co.uk/service_index.php|title=Timetables & Route Index|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Go Ahead Group|year=2007|work=Metrobus Website}}</ref>

In addition, in September 2003 the new [[Crawley Fastway|Fastway]] guided bus service began operating between [[Bewbush, Crawley|Bewbush]] and [[Gatwick Airport]].<ref name="fastway">{{Cite web|url=http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/stream/asset/?asset_id=2383834&|title=Fastway: Phase One Service Launched|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=West Sussex County Council|year=2003|work=Fastway, Issue 6|format=PDF}}</ref>  A second route, from Broadfield to the Langshott area of [[Horley]], north of Gatwick Airport, was added on [[27 August]] [[2005]].<ref name="route20">{{Cite web|url=http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/stream/asset/?asset_id=2383828&|title=Fastway information and timetable from 27 August 2005|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=West Sussex County Council|year=2005|work=Fastway leaflet (2005) at West Sussex County Council Roads & Transport website}}</ref>

===Gatwick Airport===
{{main|London Gatwick Airport}}
Gatwick Airport was originally opened as a private airfield in the 1930s. It was used during the [[World War II|Second World War]] as an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] base, returning to civil use in 1946. There were proposals to close the airport by the late 1940s, but these were altered. It closed in 1956 to enable it to be rebuilt as a second airport for London. The new airport was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] on [[9 June]] [[1958]]. A second terminal, the North Terminal, was opened in 1988.<ref name="baa">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/portal/controller/dispatcher.jsp?CiID=0fcae327ea262010VgnVCM100000147e120a____&ChID=594e1fb079432010VgnVCM100000147e120a____&Ct=B2C_CT_GENERAL&CtID=448c6a4c7f1b0010VgnVCM200000357e120a____&ChPath=Home%5ELGW%5EAbout+BAA+Gatwick%5EGatwick+lowdown%5EOur+history|title=Our History|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=BAA plcq|year=2006|work=BAA Gatwick Airport website}}</ref>
An agreement exists between [[BAA plc]] and West Sussex County Council preventing the building of a further runway until 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the [[Department for Transport]] which included possible proposals for the building of additional facilities and runways at the airport. The result of the consultation was to preclude any further expansion at Gatwick unless it was impossible to meet growth targets at [[London Heathrow Airport]] within existing pollution limits.<ref name="dft">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/archive/2002/fd/|title=The future development of air transport in the UK|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=Department for Transport|year=2003|work=Department for Transport website}}</ref>

==Sport and leisure==
[[Image:Crawley - Entrance to Broadfield Stadium.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the Broadfield Stadium.]]

There were many sports clubs which predated the new town.  [[Crawley Town F.C.]], formed in 1896, was given a home in the new town at Town Mead adjacent to the [[West Green]] playing fields. However, as the success of the club grew, so did the demand for land near the town centre for commercial and residential development. This resulted in the opening of the new [[Broadfield Stadium]] in 1997. Owned by the borough council, the ground is now the home territory for the club.<ref name="ctfc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawleytownfc.net/page.php?pageid=37|title=Crawley Town Football Club - past and present|accessdate=2007-08-02|year=2007|work=Crawley Town Football Club website}}</ref> Crawley also plays host to a [[Crawley Rugby Club|rugby club]] as well as many other sporting clubs and organisations.

[[Image:Crawley - K2 Leisure Centre 01.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to the K2 Leisure Centre.]]
Early sporting facilities in the new town were provided at the original Crawley Leisure Centre in Haslett Avenue in the Three Bridges neighbourhood.  Building work started in the early 1960s, with a large swimming pool opening in 1964.  The site was extended to include an athletics arena by 1967, and an additional large sports hall was opened by the town mayor, Councillor Ben Clay, and Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] in 1974.<ref name="wilson">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=PR1579&ssTargetNodeId=99|title=End of an era|accessdate=2007-08-03|year=2005|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref> However, the facilities did not cover as large an area as originally planned, and soon became insufficient for the growing town.
