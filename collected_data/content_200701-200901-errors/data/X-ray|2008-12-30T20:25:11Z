'''X-radiation''' (composed of '''X-rays''') is a form of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. X-rays have a [[wavelength]] in the range of 10 to 0.001 [[nanometer]]s, corresponding to [[frequency|frequencies]] in the range 30 [[Hertz|petahertz]] to 30 [[Hertz|exahertz]] (30 × 10<sup>15</sup> Hz to 30 × 10<sup>18</sup> Hz) and energies in the range 120 [[Electron volt|eV]] to 120 [[keV]]. They are shorter in wavelength than [[UV]] rays. In many languages, X-radiation is called '''Röntgen radiation''' after one of its first investigators, [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]].

X-rays are primarily used for diagnostic [[radiography]] and [[X-ray crystallography|crystallography]]. As a result, the term ''X-ray'' is [[metonomy|metonymically]] used to refer to a radiographic image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. X-rays are a form of [[ionizing radiation]] and as such can be dangerous. 

X-rays span 3 decades in wavelength, frequency and energy. From about 0.12 to 12 keV they are classified as soft X-rays, and from about 12 to 120 keV as hard X-rays, due to their penetrating abilities.

The distinction between X-rays and [[gamma ray]]s has changed in recent decades.  Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by [[X-ray tube]]s had a longer [[wavelength]] than the radiation emitted by [[radioactive]] [[nuclei]] (gamma rays).<ref name="Dendy">{{cite book

However, as shorter wavelength continuous spectrum "X-ray" sources such as [[linear accelerator]]s and longer wavelength "gamma ray" emitters were discovered, the wavelength bands largely overlapped.  The two types of radiation are now usually defined by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the [[nucleus (atomic structure)|nucleus]].<ref name="Dendy" /><ref>{{cite book

==Units of measure and exposure==  
The measure of X-rays ionizing ability is called the exposure:
*The [[coulomb]] per [[kilogram]] (C/kg) is the [[Systeme International|SI]] unit of [[ionizing radiation]] exposure, and measures the amount of radiation required to create 1 coulomb of charge of each polarity in 1 kilogram of matter.  
*The [[röntgen]] (R) is an obsolete older traditional unit of exposure, which represented the amount of radiation required to create 1 [[Electrostatic unit|esu]] of charge of each polarity in 1 cubic centimeter of dry air.  1 roentgen = 2.58×10<sup>−4</sup> C/kg

However, the effect of ionizing  radiation on matter (especially living tissue) is more closely related to the amount of [[energy]] deposited rather than the [[Electric charge|charge]].  This is called the [[absorbed dose]]:
*The [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy) which has units of (J/C), is the SI unit of [[absorbed dose]] which is the amount of radiation required to deposit 1 [[joule]] of energy in 1 [[kilogram]] of any kind of matter.  
*The [[rad (unit)|rad]] is the (obsolete) corresponding traditional unit, equal to 0.01 J deposited per kg.  100 rad = 1 Gy.

The [[equivalent dose]] is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For X-rays it is equal to the [[absorbed dose]].
*The [[sievert]] (Sv) is the SI unit of equivalent dose, which for X-rays is equal to the [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy). 
*The [[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]] is the traditional unit of equivalent dose. For X-rays it is equal to the [[rad]] or 0.01 J of energy deposited per kg.  1 sievert = 100 rem.  

Medical X-rays are a major source of ''manmade'' radiation exposure, accounting for 58% in the USA in 1987, but since most radiation exposure is natural (82%) it only accounts for 10% of ''total'' USA radiation exposure.<ref>{{cite book

Reported dosage due to dental X-rays seems to vary significantly.

X-rays are generated by an [[X-ray tube]], a [[vacuum tube]] that uses a high voltage to accelerate [[electron]]s released by a [[hot cathode]] to a high velocity.  The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the [[anode]], creating the X-rays.<ref>{{cite book

  | isbn = 044307027X}}</ref>  In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually [[tungsten]] or a more crack-resistant alloy of [[rhenium]] (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes [[molybdenum]] for more specialized applications, such as when soft X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a [[copper]] target is most common, with [[cobalt]] often being used when fluorescence from [[iron]] content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.

The maximum energy of the produced X-ray photon in [[keV]] is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube, so an 80 kV tube can't create higher than 80 keV X-rays.  When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:
#[[X-ray fluorescence]]: If the electron has enough energy it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner [[Electron shell|shell]] of a metal atom, and as a result electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and X-ray photons are emitted.  This process produces a [[discrete spectrum]] of X-ray frequencies, called spectral lines.   The spectral lines generated depends on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called [[K-alpha|K lines]]), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.  
#''[[Bremsstrahlung]]'': This is radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-''Z'' ([[proton]] number) nuclei.  These X-rays have a [[continuous spectrum]].  The intensity of the X-rays increases linearly with decreasing frequency, from zero at the energy of the incident electrons, the voltage on the [[X-ray tube]].  
So the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines.  The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes, and thus the highest energies of the X-rays, range from roughly 20 to 150 kV.<ref>{{cite book

In medical diagnostic applications, the low energy (soft) X-rays are unwanted, since they are totally absorbed by the body, increasing the dose.  So a thin metal (often aluminum) sheet is placed over the window of the X-ray tube, filtering out the low energy end of the spectrum.  This is called ''hardening'' the beam.<!-- This is redundant; it's present in the introuction: Very hard X-rays overlap with the range of "long"-wavelength (lower energy) [[gamma rays]], however the distinction between the two terms in medicine depends on the source of the radiation, not its wavelength; X-ray [[photon]]s are generated by energetic [[electron]] processes, gamma rays by transitions within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].{{Fact|date=July 2008}} -->

Both X-ray production processes are extremely inefficient (~1%) and thus to produce a usable flux of X-rays plenty of energy has to be wasted into heat, which has to be removed from the X-ray tube.

Radiographs obtained using X-rays can be used to identify a wide spectrum of pathologies. Due to their short wavelength, in medical applications, X-rays act more like a particle than a wave. This is in contrast to their application in crystallography, where their wave-like nature is most important.

To take an X-ray of the bones, short X-ray pulses are shot through a body with radiographic film behind. The bones absorb the most photons by the [[photoelectric]] process, because they are more electron-dense. The X-rays that do not get absorbed turn the photographic film from white to black, leaving a white shadow of bones on the film.

To generate an image of the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins ([[angiography]]) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after iodinated contrast material has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels.  The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine if there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.

A specialized source of X-rays which is becoming widely used in research is [[synchrotron radiation]], which is generated by [[particle accelerator]]s.   Its unique features are brightness many orders of magnitude greater than X-ray tubes, wide spectrum, high [[collimation]], and [[linear polarization]].<ref>{{cite conference

==Detectors==
===Photographic plate===
The detection of X-rays is based on various methods. The most commonly known methods are a [[photographic plate]], X-ray [[photographic film|film]] in a cassette, and [[Rare earth element|rare earth]] screens. Regardless of what is "catching" the image, they are all categorized as "Image Receptors" (IR).

Before computers and before digital imaging, a [[photographic plate]] was used to produce radiographic images. The images were produced right on the glass plates. Film replaced these plates and was used in [[hospital]]s to produce images. Now computed & digital radiography has started to replace film in medicine, though film technology remains in use in industrial radiography processes (e.g. to inspect welded seams).  Photographic plates are a thing of history, and their replacement (intensifying screens) is now becoming part of that same history.  Silver (necessary to the radiographic & photographic industry) is a non-renewable resource, that has now been replaced by digital (DR) and computed (CR) technology.  Where film required wet processing facilities, these new technologies do not.  Archiving of these new technologies also saves space. 

Since photographic plates are sensitive to X-rays, they provide a means of recording the image, but require a lot of exposure (to the patient), so intensifying screens were devised. They allow a lower dose to the patient, because the screens take the X-ray information and intensify it so that it can be recorded on film positioned next to the intensifying screen.

The part of the patient to be X-rayed is placed between the X-ray source and the image receptor to produce a shadow of the internal structure of that particular part of the body. X-rays are partially blocked ("attenuated") by dense tissues such as bone, and pass more easily through soft tissues. Areas where the X-rays strike darken when developed, causing bones to appear lighter than the surrounding soft tissue.

Contrast compounds containing [[barium]] or [[iodine]], which are [[radiopaque]], can be ingested in the gastrointestinal tract (barium) or injected in the artery or veins to highlight these vessels.  The contrast compounds have high atomic numbered elements in them that (like bone) essentially block the X-rays and hence the once hollow organ or vessel can be more readily seen. In the pursuit of a non-toxic contrast material, many types of high atomic number elements were evaluated. For example, the first time the forefathers used contrast it was chalk, and was used on a cadaver's vessels. Unfortunately, some elements chosen proved to be harmful – for example,  [[thorium]] was once used as a contrast medium (Thorotrast) – which turned out to be toxic in some cases (causing injury and occasionally death from the effects of thorium poisoning). Modern contrast material has improved, and while there is no way to determine who may have a sensitivity to the contrast, the incidence of "allergic-type reactions" are low. (The risk is comparable to that associated with penicillin.{{Fact|date=December 2008}})

===Photostimulable phosphors (PSPs)===
An increasingly common method of is the use of [[photostimulated luminescence]] (PSL), pioneered by Fuji in the 1980s. In modern hospitals a [[photostimulable phosphor plate]] (PSP plate) is used in place of the photographic plate. After the plate is X-rayed, excited electrons in the phosphor material remain "trapped" in "colour centres" in the crystal lattice until stimulated by a laser beam passed over the plate surface. The light given off during laser stimulation is collected by a photomultiplier tube and the resulting signal is converted into a digital image by computer technology, which gives this process its common name, [[computed radiography]] (also referred to as '''digital radiography'''). The PSP plate can be reused, and existing X-ray equipment requires no modification to use them.

===Geiger counter=== 
Initially, most common detection methods were based on the [[plasma (physics)|ionization of gases]], as in the [[Geiger counter|Geiger-Müller counter]]: a sealed volume, usually a cylinder, with a mica, polymer or thin metal window contains a gas, and a wire, and a high voltage is applied between the cylinder ([[cathode]]) and the wire ([[anode]]). When an X-ray photon enters the cylinder, it ionizes the gas and forms ions and electrons. Electrons accelerate toward the anode, in the process causing further ionization along their trajectory. This process, known as a [[Townsend avalanche]], is detected as a sudden current, called a "count" or "event".

Ultimately, the electrons form a virtual cathode around the anode wire, drastically reducing the electric field in the outer portions of the tube. This halts the collisional ionizations and limits further growth of avalanches. As a result, all "counts" on a Geiger counter are the same size and it can give no indication as to the particle energy of the radiation, unlike the [[proportional counter]]. The intensity of the radiation is measurable by the Geiger counter as the counting-rate of the system.

In order to gain energy spectrum information, a [[diffraction|diffracting]] crystal may be used to first separate the different photons. The method is called [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] ([[WDX]] or WDS). Position-sensitive detectors are often used in conjunction with dispersive elements. Other detection equipment that is inherently energy-resolving may be used, such as the aforementioned [[proportional counter]]s. In either case, use of suitable pulse-processing (MCA) equipment allows digital spectra to be created for later analysis.

For many applications, counters are not sealed but are constantly fed with purified gas, thus reducing problems of contamination or gas aging. These are called "flow counters".

===Scintillators===
Some materials such as [[sodium iodide]] (NaI) can "convert" an X-ray photon to a visible photon; an electronic detector can be built by adding a [[photomultiplier]]. These detectors are called "[[scintillator]]s", filmscreens or "[[scintillation counter]]s". The main advantage of using these is that an adequate image can be obtained while subjecting the patient to a much lower dose of X-rays.

===Image intensification===
[[Image:Laprascopy-Roentgen.jpg|right|thumb|250px|X-ray during [[Cholecystectomy]]]]
X-rays are also used in "real-time" procedures such as [[angiography]] or contrast studies of the hollow organs (e.g. [[barium enema]] of the small or large intestine) using [[fluoroscopy]] acquired using an [[X-ray image intensifier]]. [[Angioplasty]], medical interventions of the arterial system, rely heavily on X-ray-sensitive contrast to identify potentially treatable lesions.

===Direct semiconductor detectors===
Since the 1970s, new [[semiconductor detector]]s have been developed ([[silicon]] or [[germanium]] doped with [[lithium]], Si(Li) or Ge(Li)). X-ray photons are converted to electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor and are collected to detect the X-rays. When the temperature is low enough (the detector is cooled by [[Peltier effect]] or even cooler [[liquid nitrogen]]), it is possible to directly determine the X-ray energy spectrum; this method is called [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDX or EDS); it is often used in small [[X-ray fluorescence]] [[spectroscopy|spectrometers]]. These detectors are sometimes called "[[solid state]] detectors". [[Cadmium telluride]] ([[cadmium|Cd]]Te) and its alloy with [[zinc]], [[cadmium zinc telluride]] detectors have an increased sensitivity, which allows lower doses of X-rays to be used.

Practical application in [[medical imaging]] didn't start taking place until the 1990s. Currently amorphous [[selenium]] is used in commercial large area flat panel X-ray detectors for [[mammography]] and chest [[radiography]]. Current research and development is focused around pixel detectors, such as [[CERN]]'s energy resolving [[Medipix]] detector.

Note: A standard [[semiconductor]] [[diode]], such as a 1N4007, will produce a small amount of current when placed in an X-ray beam. A test device once used by Medical Imaging Service personnel was a small project box that contained several diodes of this type in [[series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], which could be connected to an [[oscilloscope]] as a quick diagnostic. 

[[Silicon drift detector]]s (SDDs), produced by conventional [[semiconductor fabrication]], now provide a cost-effective and high resolving power radiation measurement. Unlike conventional X-ray detectors, such as Si(Li)s, they do not need to be cooled with liquid nitrogen.

===Scintillator plus semiconductor detectors (indirect detection)===
With the advent of large semiconductor array detectors it has become possible to design detector systems using a scintillator screen to convert from X-rays to visible light which is then converted to electrical signals in an array detector.  Indirect Flat Panel Detectors (FPDs) are in widespread use today in medical, dental, veterinary and industrial applications. <!-- This looks redundant too: A common form of these detectors is based on [[amorphous silicon]] [[Thin film transistor|TFT]]/[[photodiode]] arrays. -->

The array technology is a variant on the amorphous silicon TFT arrays used in many [[flat panel display]]s, like the ones in computer laptops. The array consists of a sheet of glass covered with a thin layer of silicon that is in an amorphous or disordered state. At a microscopic scale, the silicon has been imprinted with millions of transistors arranged in a highly ordered array, like the grid on a sheet of graph paper. Each of these [[thin film transistor]]s (TFTs) are attached to a light-absorbing photodiode making up an individual [[pixel]] (picture element).  Photons striking the photodiode are converted into two [[charge carrier|carriers of electrical charge]], called electron-hole pairs.  Since the number of charge carriers produced will vary with the intensity of incoming light photons, an electrical pattern is created that can be swiftly converted to a voltage and then a digital signal, which is interpreted by a computer to produce a digital image.  Although silicon has outstanding electronic properties, it is not a particularly good absorber of X-ray photons. For this reason, X-rays first impinge upon [[scintillator]]s made from e.g. [[gadolinium oxysulfide]] or [[caesium iodide]]. The scintillator absorbs the X-rays and converts them into visible light photons that then pass onto the photodiode array.

===Visibility to the human eye===
While generally considered invisible to the human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible.<ref>{{cite web

When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door Röntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the [[experiment]] was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with [[ionizing radiation]]. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of [[rhodopsin]] molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of [[phosphorescence]] in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.

Though X-rays are invisible it is possible to see the [[ionization]] of the air molecules if the intensity of the X-ray beam is high enough. The beamline from the [[Wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]] at the [http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/MaterialsScience/faisceau ID11] at [[ESRF]] is one example of such high intensity.<ref>{{ cite book

==Medical uses==

[[Image:X-Ray Skull.jpg|right|thumb|150px||X-Ray Image of the Paranasal Sinuses, Lateral Projection]]
Since Röntgen's discovery that X-rays can identify bony structures, X-rays have been developed for their use in [[medical imaging]]. [[Radiology]] is a specialized field of [[medicine]]. Radiologists employ [[radiography]] and other techniques for [[diagnostic imaging]]. This is probably the most common use of X-ray technology.

X-rays are especially useful in the detection of pathology of the [[bone|skeletal system]], but are also useful for detecting some disease processes in [[soft tissue]]. Some notable examples are the very common [[chest X-ray]], which can be used to identify lung diseases such as [[pneumonia]], [[lung cancer]] or [[pulmonary edema]], and the [[abdominal X-ray]], which can detect [[ileus]] (blockage of the [[intestine]]), free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in [[ascites]]). In some cases, the use of X-rays is debatable, such as [[gallstone]]s (which are rarely [[radiopaque]]) or [[kidney stone]]s (which are often visible, but not always). Also, traditional plain X-rays pose very little use in the imaging of soft tissues such as the [[brain]] or [[muscle]]. Imaging alternatives for soft tissues are [[computed axial tomography]] (CAT or CT scanning), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) or [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]]. Since 2005, X-rays are listed as a [[carcinogen]] by the U.S. government.<ref>[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/toc11.html 11th Report on Carcinogens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Radiotherapy]], a curative medical intervention, now used almost exclusively for [[cancer]], employs higher energies of radiation.

==Shielding against X-Rays==

[[Lead]] is the most common shield agains X-Rays because of its high density (11340 kg/m<sup>3</sup>), its easiness of installation and low price.

The following table shows the recommended thickness of lead shielding in function of X-Ray energy, from the Recommendations by the Second International Congress of Radiology.<ref>Alchemy Art Lead Products - [http://www.alchemycastings.com/pdf/SheetLead.pdf Lead Shielding Sheet Lead For Shielding Applications], retrieved [[2008-12-07]]</ref>

==History==
X-rays were discovered emanating from [[Crookes tube]]s, experimental [[discharge tube]]s invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the [[cathode ray]]s, that is energetic [[electron]] beams, that were first created in the tubes.  Crookes tubes created electrons by [[ionization]] of the residual air in the tube by a high DC [[voltage]] of anywhere between a few [[kilovolt]]s and 100 kV.  This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the [[cathode]] to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the [[anode]] or the glass wall of the tube.  Many of the early Crookes tubes undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below, before [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] first systematically studied them in 1895.  Among the important early researchers in X-rays were [[Ivan Pulyui]], [[William Crookes]], [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], [[Heinrich Hertz]], [[Philipp Lenard]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Charles Glover Barkla]], [[Max von Laue]], and [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]]. 

===Wilhelm Röntgen===
On November 8, 1895, [[Germany|German]] physics professor [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]], stumbled on X-rays while experimenting with [[Philipp Lenard|Lenard]] and [[Crookes tube]]s and began studying them.  He wrote an initial report "''On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication''" and on December 28, 1895 submitted it to the [[Würzburg]]'s Physical-Medical Society journal.<ref>{{Citation

Röntgen referred to the radiation as "X", to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over Röntgen's great objections), many of his colleagues suggested calling them '''Röntgen rays'''. They are still referred to as such in many languages, including German. Röntgen received the first [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his discovery.

There are conflicting accounts of his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers:<ref>{{cite web

He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away.  The invisible rays coming from the tube to make the screen glow were passing through the cardboard.  He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk.   Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically.  Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.

Röntgen discovered its medical use when he saw a picture of his wife's hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. His wife's hand's photograph was the first ever photograph of a human body part using X-rays.

===Johann Hittorf===

German physicist [[Johann Hittorf]] (1824 – 1914), a coinventor and early researcher of the Crookes tube, found when he placed unexposed photographic plates near the tube, that some of them were flawed by shadows, though he did not investigate this effect.

===Ivan Pulyui===
In 1877 [[Ukrane|Ukranian]]-born [[Ivan Pulyui|Pulyui]], a lecturer in experimental physics at the [[University of Vienna]], constructed various designs of [[Geissler tube|vacuum discharge tube]] to investigate their properties.<ref name=mayo>{{cite web

Early in 1896, just a few weeks after [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen|Röntgen]] published his first X-ray photograph, Pulyui published high-quality x-ray images in journals in Paris and London.<ref name=mayo/>  Although Pulyui had studied with Röntgen at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in the years 1873-75, his biographer Gaida (1997) asserts that his subsequent research was conducted independently.<ref name=mayo/>

The first medical X-ray made in the United States was obtained using a discharge tube of Pulyui's design. In January 1896, on reading of Röntgen's discovery, Frank Austin of [[Dartmouth College]] tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the Pulyui tube produced X-rays. This was a result of Pulyui's inclusion of an oblique "target" of [[mica]], used for holding samples of [[fluorescent]] material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896 Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Edwin had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture,  to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on [[Photographic plate|gelatin photographic plates]] obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in Röntgen's work.<ref>{{cite journal

===Nikola Tesla===
In April 1887, [[Nikola Tesla]] began to investigate X-rays using high voltages and tubes of his own design, as well as [[Crookes tube]]s. From his technical publications, it is indicated that he invented and developed a special single-electrode X-ray tube,<ref>Morton, William James, and Edwin W. Hammer, American Technical Book Co., 1896. Page 68.</ref><ref>{{US patent|514170}}, ''Incandescent Electric Light'', and {{US patent|454622}}, ''System of Electric Lighting''.</ref> which differed from other X-ray tubes in having no target electrode. The principle behind Tesla's device is called the [[Bremsstrahlung]] process, in which a high-energy secondary X-ray emission is produced when charged particles (such as electrons) pass through matter. By 1892, Tesla performed several such experiments, but he did not categorize the emissions as what were later called X-rays. Tesla generalized the phenomenon as [[radiant energy]] of "invisible" kinds.<ref>Cheney, Margaret, "[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0743215362 Tesla: Man Out of Time ]".

===Fernando Sanford===

X-rays were generated and detected by [[Fernando Sanford]] (1854-1948), the foundation Professor of Physics at [[Stanford University]], in 1891. From 1886 to 1888 he had studied in the [[Hermann Helmholtz]] laboratory in Berlin, where he became familiar with the cathode rays generated in vacuum tubes when a voltage was applied across separate electrodes, as previously studied by [[Heinrich Hertz]] and [[Philipp Lenard]].  His letter of January 6, 1893 (describing his discovery as "electric photography") to The [[Physical Review]] was duly published and an article entitled ''Without Lens or Light, Photographs Taken With Plate and Object in Darkness'' appeared in the [[San Francisco Examiner]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Wyman|first=Thomas |year=2005 |month= Spring |title=Fernando Sanford and the Discovery of X-rays |journal= "Imprint", from the Associates of the Stanford University Libraries |volume= |issue= |pages=5–15}}</ref>

===Philipp Lenard===
[[Philipp Lenard]], a student of Heinrich Hertz, wanted to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air.  He built a Crookes tube (later called a "Lenard tube") with a "window" in the end made of thin aluminum, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it.<ref name="Thomson">{{cite book

It has been suggested that at least some of these "Lenard rays" were actually X-rays.<ref>Thomson, 1903, p.185</ref>   
[[Hermann von Helmholtz]] formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Röntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light<ref>''Wiedmann's Annalen'', Vol. XLVIII</ref>.  However, he did not work with actual X-rays.

===Thomas Edison===
[[Image:Roentgen-Roehre.svg|thumb|Diagram of a water cooled X-ray tube. (simplified/outdated)]]In 1895, [[Thomas Edison]] investigated materials' ability to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays, and found that [[calcium tungstate]] was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the fluoroscope he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903 after the death of [[Clarence Madison Dally]], one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a [[cancer]] in them so tenacious that both arms were [[amputation|amputated]] in a futile attempt to save his life. "At the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, an assassin shot President [[William McKinley]] twice at close range with a .32 caliber revolver." The first bullet was removed but the second remained lodged somewhere in his stomach. McKinley survived for some time and requested that Thomas Edison "rush an X-ray machine to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived ''but wasn't used'' . . . McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection."<ref>National Library of Medicine. "Could X-rays Have Saved President William McKinley?" ''Visible Proofs: Forensic Views of the Body''. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/mckinley.html</ref>

===The 20th century and beyond===
[[Image:Historical X-ray nci-vol-1893-300.jpg|thumb|A male technician taking an x-ray of a female patient in 1940. This image was used to argue that exposure to radiation during the x-ray procedure would be a myth.]]
The many applications of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest.  Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays, and these first generation [[cold cathode]] or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.    

Crookes tubes were unreliable.  They had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated.  However as time passed the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate "harder" X-rays until it soon stopped operating.  Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as "softeners".  This often took the form of a small side tube which contained a small piece of mica – a substance that traps comparatively large quantities of air within its structure.  A small electrical heater heated the mica and caused it to release a small amount of air restoring the tube's efficiency.  However the mica itself had a limited life and the restore process was consequently difficult to control.

In 1904, [[John Ambrose Fleming]] invented the [[thermionic valve|thermionic diode valve]] (vacuum tube).  This used a [[hot cathode]] which permitted current to flow in a vacuum.  This idea was quickly applied X-ray tubes, and heated cathode X-ray tubes, called Coolidge tubes, replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.

Two years later, physicist [[Charles Glover Barkla|Charles Barkla]] discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic X-ray. He won the 1917 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery. [[Max von Laue]], Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich observed for the first time the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals in 1912. This discovery, along with the early works of [[Paul Peter Ewald]], [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] gave birth to the field of X-ray [[crystallography]]. The [[X-ray tube#Coolidge_tube|Coolidge tube]] was invented the following year by [[William D. Coolidge]] which permitted continuous production of X-rays; this type of tube is still in use today.

[[Image:Moon in x-rays.gif|thumb|right|222px|[[ROSAT]] image of X-ray [[fluorescence]] of, and [[occultation]] of the [[X-ray background]] by, the [[Moon]].]]

The use of X-rays for medical purposes (to develop into the field of [[radiation therapy]]) was pioneered by Major [[John Hall-Edwards]] in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. In 1908, he had to have his left arm amputated owing to the spread of [[X-ray dermatitis]][http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/xray].

The [[X-ray microscope]] was invented in the 1950s. 

The [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], launched on July 23, 1999, has been allowing the exploration of the very violent processes in the universe which produce X-rays. Unlike visible light, which is a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable, it features stars being torn apart by [[black hole]]s, galactic collisions, and novas, [[neutron star]]s that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space.

An [[X-ray laser]] device was proposed as part of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]]'s [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s, but the first and only test of the device (a sort of laser "blaster", or [[death ray]], powered by a thermonuclear explosion) gave inconclusive results. For technical and political reasons, the overall project (including the X-ray laser) was de-funded (though was later revived by the second [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] as [[National Missile Defense]] using different technologies).
