It has campuses at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury-Wodonga]], [[Dubbo, New South Wales|Dubbo]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and [[Wagga Wagga]]. It also has specialist centres in [[Canberra]], [[Manly]] (Sydney), [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]]. It is the main university servicing the west and southwest of New South Wales, and also serves north eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

CSU courses are also delivered by various [[Technical and Further Education|TAFEs]] (members of [[TAFE NSW]] and [[Holmesglen Institute of TAFE]] in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]); and private institution ''Study Group'''s [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] and [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] campuses (known as ''CSU Study Centres'').

CSU is well known for its extensive range of [[distance education]] courses, being a leader in the field and claims to be one of Australia's largest providers of distance education.

== History ==

The University was established on [[19 July]] [[1989]] from the merger of several existing separately-administered [[College of Advanced Education|Colleges of Advanced Education]] including the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst and the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education in Albury-Wodonga and Wagga Wagga, through the enactment of The Charles Sturt University Act, 1989 (Act No. 76, 1989). It is named in honour of explorer [[Charles Sturt]].

The Mitchell College of Advanced Education had been formed on [[1 January]] [[1971]], and the Riverina-Murray Institute in Wagga Wagga and Albury-Wodonga had operated since 1985. The latter institution had earlier succeeded the Riverina College of Advanced Education, which was itself the result of an even earlier merger between Wagga Agricultural College and Wagga Teachers College. 

In late 2004, CSU formalised moves to assume control of the [[University of Sydney]]'s [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] campus, which came into force on [[1 January]] [[2005]]. From that date, all new Orange campus students were eligible to qualify for degrees from CSU; continuing students continued to be awarded their degrees from Sydney.

In the 2005 Melbourne Institute International Standing of Australian Universities it was ranked 33rd out of the 38 Universities in Australia<ref>[http://www.australian-universities.com/rankings/ http://www.australian-universities.com/rankings/]</ref>

On its Bathurst campus, CSU operates a radio station, [[2MCE FM Bathurst|2MCE]], which also acts as the originating studio for ''[[National Radio News]]'', a popular community radio news service.
