'''Crawley''' ({{Audio|en-uk-Crawley.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a town and [[local government district]] with [[Borough status in England and Wales|Borough status]] in [[West Sussex]], England. It is {{convert|28|mi|km|0}} south of [[London]], {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} north of [[Brighton and Hove]], and {{convert|32|mi|km|0}} northeast of the county town of [[Chichester]], covers an area of {{convert|17.36|sqmi|km2|2}} and had a population of 99,744 at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]].

The area has been inhabited since [[Three-age system|the Stone Age]], and was a centre of iron-making in [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. Crawley developed slowly as a [[market town]] from the 13th century, serving the surrounding villages in the [[Weald]]; its location on the main road from London to Brighton brought a passing trade, encouraging the development of [[coaching inn]]s.  It was connected to the railway network in the 1840s.  [[Gatwick Airport]], now one of Britain's busiest international airports, opened on the edge of the town in the 1940s, encouraging commercial and industrial growth.  After the [[Second World War]], the British Government planned to move large numbers of people and jobs out of London and into [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] around South East England. The [[New Towns Act 1946]] designated Crawley as the site of one of these.<ref name="SuppMem">{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap23.htm|title=Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions: Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence. Supplementary memorandum by Crawley Borough Council (NT 15(a))|accessdate=2008-04-02|publisher=The Information Policy Division, Office of Public Sector Information|year=2002|work=United Kingdom Parliament Publications and Records website}}</ref>  A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, and rapid development greatly increased the size and population of the town in a few decades.

The town comprises 13 residential neighbourhoods based around the core of the old market town, and separated by main roads and railway lines.  The nearby communities of [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]], [[Pound Hill, Crawley|Pound Hill]] and [[Three Bridges]] were absorbed into the new town at different stages of its development. As of 2008, expansion is planned in the west and northwest of the town, in co-operation with [[Horsham (district)|Horsham District Council]].<ref name="wnw">{{Cite web|url=http://194.201.99.228/Index.htm|title=West and North West of Crawley|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Horsham District Council|year=2007|author=Horsham District Council & Crawley Borough Council|work=West and North West of Crawley website}}</ref>  Economically, the town has developed into the main centre of industry and employment between London and the south coast of England.  A large industrial area supports industries and services, many of which are connected with the airport, and the commercial and retail sectors continue to expand.<ref name="SuppMem"/>

==History==
===Origins===
The area may have been settled during the [[Mesolithic]] period: locally manufactured [[flint]]s of the Horsham Culture type have been found to the southwest of the town.  Tools and [[burial mound]]s from the [[Neolithic period]], and burial mounds and a sword from the [[Bronze Age]], have also been discovered.<ref name="cbchist">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=221&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN|title=A Brief History of Crawley|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref><ref name="cole">{{cite book | title=Crawley: A History & Celebration| last=Cole| first=Belinda| year=2004| publisher=Frith Book Company Ltd| location=Salisbury| isbn=1904938191}}</ref>  Crawley is on the western edge of the [[High Weald]], which produced iron for more than 2,000&nbsp;years from the [[Iron Age]] onwards.<ref name="HighWeald">{{cite web|url=http://www.highweald.org/text.asp?PageId=16|title=About The High Weald: The Iron Story|accessdate=2008-04-02|publisher=High Weald AONB Unit|year=2008|work=High Weald AONB Unit website}}</ref>  Goffs Park—now a recreational area in the south of the town—was the site of two late Iron Age furnaces.<ref name="RIS1">{{cite web|url=http://www.romansinsussex.co.uk/level3/themes/life_in_late_iron_age_sussex_trade_indus.asp|title= Life in Late Iron Age Sussex: Trade & Industry|accessdate=2008-04-02|publisher=The Sussex Archaeological Society|year=2008|work=Romans In Sussex website}}</ref>  Ironworking and mineral extraction continued throughout [[Roman Britain|Roman times]], particularly in the Broadfield area where many furnaces were built.<ref name="cbchist"/><ref name="RIS2">{{cite web|url=http://www.romansinsussex.co.uk/level3/themes/life_roman_britain/crafts_industry_iron.asp|title=Life in Roman Sussex: Crafts & Industry: Weald Iron Industry|accessdate=2008-04-02|publisher=The Sussex Archaeological Society|year=2008|work=Romans In Sussex website}}</ref>

In the 5th&nbsp;century, [[Saxons|Saxon]] settlers named the area Crow's Leah—meaning a crow-infested clearing, or Crow's Wood<ref name="cole"/>—although the name changed considerably over time.  The present spelling appeared by the early 14th&nbsp;century.<ref name="cbchist"/> By this time, nearby settlements were more established: the Saxon church at [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]], for example, dates from between 950 and 1050&nbsp;AD.<ref name="WorthChurch">{{cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT009968|title=Crawley Borough Council: St Nicholas Church|accessdate=2007-03-28|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2008|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>

===Railway age and Victorian era===
The [[Brighton Main Line]] was the first railway line to serve the Crawley area.  A station was opened at [[Three Bridges]] (originally known as East Crawley)<ref name="eastcrawley">{{Cite web|url=http://www.maidenbower.org.uk/history/palmerhistory.pdf|title=A brief history of Maidenbower|accessdate=2007-09-06|author=David Palmer|publisher=Stuart Cummings|year=2003|work=Maidenbower Village website}}</ref> in the summer of 1841.  [[Crawley railway station]], at the southern end of the High Street, was built in 1848 when the [[Arun Valley Line|Horsham branch]] was opened from Three Bridges to Horsham.  A line was built eastwards from [[Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line|Three Bridges to East Grinstead]] in 1855.  Three Bridges had become the hub of transport in the area by this stage: one-quarter of its population was employed in railway jobs by 1861 (mainly at the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]]'s railway works near the station).<ref name="fredgray">

There was a major expansion in housebuilding in the late 19th century.  An area known as "New Town" (unrelated to the postwar developments) was created around the railway [[level crossing]] and down the Brighton Road;<ref name="cole"/><ref name="fredgray"/> the [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]] area, west of the High Street on the way to Ifield, was built up; and housing spread south of the Horsham line for the first time, into what is now [[Southgate, Crawley|Southgate]]. The population reached 4,433 in 1901, compared to 1,357 a century earlier.<ref name="popC"/>  In 1891, a racecourse was opened on farmland at Gatwick.  Built to replace a [[steeplechase]] course at [[Waddon]] near [[Croydon]] in Surrey, it was used for both steeplechase and [[flat racing]], and held the [[Grand National]] during the years of the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name="cbchist"/>  The course had its own railway station on the Brighton Main Line.<ref name="Gwynne146">{{cite book |last=Gwynne |first=Peter |title=A History of Crawley |origyear=1990 |publisher=Phillimore & Company |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-718-6 |pages=146| chapter=Into the Twentieth Century}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, many of the large [[Estate (house)|country estates]] in the area, with their [[mansion]]s and associated grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and small farms.<ref name="fredgray"/>  By the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the [[A23 road|A23]] London&ndash;Brighton road.  Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50&nbsp;years.<ref name="fredgray"/>  An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the [[World War II|Second World War]] when it was claimed by the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name="cbchist"/>

===New Town===
[[Image:Crawley - The Boulevard (W).jpg|thumb|right|The Boulevard, a main east–west road separating the civic and retail areas of Crawley]]

In May 1946, the [[New Towns Act 1946]] identified Crawley as a suitable location for a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]];<ref name="SuppMem"/> but it was not officially designated as such until {{nowrap|9 January 1947}}.<ref name="Gazette">{{LondonGazette|issue=37849|startpage=231|date=10 January 1947|accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> The {{convert|5920|acre|ha|0}} of land set aside for the new town were split across the county borders between [[East Sussex]], [[West Sussex]] and [[Surrey]]. Architect [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]] was appointed chairman of the Development Corporation for the town. A court challenge to the designation order meant that plans were not officially confirmed until December 1947. By this time, an initial plan for the development of the area had been drawn up by Anthony Minoprio.<ref name="vic">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18414|title=Crawley New Town|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=British History Online|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P.

Work began almost immediately to prepare for the expansion of the town.  A full master plan was in place by 1949. This envisaged an increase in the population of the town to 50,000, residential properties in nine neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, and a separate industrial area to the north.<ref name="vic"/> The neighbourhoods would consist mainly of three-bedroom family homes, with a number of smaller and larger properties . Each would be built around a centre with shops, a [[Church (building)|church]], a [[public house]], a [[primary school]] and a [[community centre]].<ref name="cbc"/> [[Secondary education]] was to be provided at campuses at Ifield Green, Three Bridges and [[Tilgate, Crawley|Tilgate]].<ref name="plan">{{cite journal | title=First proposed structure plan, 1947| journal=Nostalgia: A Crawley Observer Supplement| year=1995| issue=2| pages=3}}</ref> Later, a fourth campus, in Southgate, was added to the plans.<ref name="masterplan">{{Cite map|title=The Crawley Development Corporation's Master Plan for Crawley New Town|publisher=Crawley Development Corporation|year=1949}}</ref>

At first, little development took place in the town centre, and residents relied on the shops and services in the existing high street. The earliest progress was in [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]], where new residents moved in during the late 1940s. In 1950 the town was visited by the then heir to the throne, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]], when she officially opened the [[Manor Royal, Crawley|Manor Royal]] industrial area. Building work continued throughout the 1950s in West Green, [[Northgate, Crawley|Northgate]] and Three Bridges, and later in [[Langley Green, Crawley|Langley Green]], [[Pound Hill, Crawley|Pound Hill]] and Ifield. In 1956, land at "Tilgate East" was allocated for housing use, eventually becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Furnace Green, Crawley|Furnace Green]].<ref name="vic"/>

[[Image:Woodfield Road, Northgate.JPG|thumb|right|Woodfield Road, a residential road in the Northgate neighbourhood]]

Expectations of the eventual population of the town were revised upwards several times.  The 1949 master plan had allowed for 50,000 people, but this was amended to 55,000 in 1956 after the Development Corporation had successfully resisted pressure from the Minister for Town and Country Planning to accommodate 60,000.  Nevertheless, plans dated 1961 anticipated growth to 70,000 by 1980, and by 1969 consideration was given to an eventual expansion of up to 120,000.<ref name="vic"/>

Extended shopping facilities to the east of the existing high street were provided. The first stage to open was The Broadwalk in 1954, following by the opening of the Queen's Square development by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] in 1958. Crawley railway station was moved eastwards towards the new development.<ref name="vic"/>

By April 1960, when Thomas Bennett made his last presentation as chairman of the Development Corporation, the town's population had reached 51,700; {{convert|2289000|sqft|m2|-2}} of factory and other industrial space had been provided; 21,800 people were employed, nearly 60% of whom worked in manufacturing industry; and only seventy people were registered as unemployed.  The corporation had built 10,254 houses, and private builders provided around 1,500 more. Tenants were by then permitted to buy their houses, and 440&nbsp;householders had chosen to do so by April 1960.<ref name="13years"/>

[[Image:St Mary's Church, Southgate, Crawley.jpg|thumb|right|One of the neighbourhood churches: St Mary's in Southgate]]

A new plan was put forward by West Sussex County Council in 1961. This proposed new neighbourhoods at [[Broadfield, West Sussex|Broadfield]] and [[Bewbush]], both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also took place in the area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.<ref name="vicdates"/>

By 1980, the council identified land at [[Maidenbower]], south of the Pound Hill neighbourhood, as being suitable for another new neighbourhood, and work began in 1986.

Crawley Urban District Council was formed in May 1956 from the part of the Horsham Rural District which covered the new town.<ref name="Gwynne165">{{cite book |last=Gwynne |first=Peter |title=A History of Crawley |origyear=1990 |publisher=Phillimore & Company |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-718-6 |pages=165| chapter=The New Town—Maturity}}</ref> The [[Local Government Act 1972]] led to the district being reformed as a borough in April 1974,<ref name="arms">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010340&ssTargetNodeId=425&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN|title=Coat of Arms|accessdate=2007-09-01|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref> gaining a mayor for the first time.<ref name="mayor">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010428|title=Past Mayors|accessdate=2008-04-09|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>

The Urban District Council received its [[coat of arms]] from the [[College of Heralds]] in 1957. After the change to borough status a modified coat of arms, based on the original, was awarded in 1976, and presented to the council on 24 March 1977. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town's location at the meeting point of north–south and east–west roads. The shield bears nine [[martlet]]s representing both the county of [[Sussex]] and the new town's original nine neighbourhoods. Supporters, of an eagle and a winged lion, relate to the significance of the airport to the locality. The motto featured is ''I Grow and I Rejoice''—a translation of a phrase from the ''Epistulae'' of [[Seneca the Younger]].<ref name="arms"/>

Initially the district (and then borough) council worked with the [[English Partnerships|Commission for New Towns]] on many aspects of development; but in 1978 many of the commission's assets, such as housing and parks, were surrendered to the council. The authority's boundaries were extended in 1983 to accommodate the Bewbush and Broadfield neighbourhoods.<ref name="guide">{{cite book | title=Crawley: Official Guide| last=Crawley Borough Council| year=1997| publisher=Local Authority Publishing Co. Ltd.| location=Wallington}}</ref>

The borough remains part of the local two-tier arrangements, with services shared with West Sussex County Council. The authority is divided into 15&nbsp;wards, each of which is represented by two or three local councillors, forming a total council of 37&nbsp;members. Most wards are coterminous with the borough's neighbourhoods, but two neighbourhoods are divided: Broadfield into North and South wards, and Pound Hill into "Pound Hill North" and "Pound Hill South and Worth". The council is elected in thirds.<ref name="bcfe">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk/files/dms/Crawley_5885-5489__E__.pdf|title=Final recommendations on the future electoral arrangements for Crawley in West Sussex|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=The Boundary Committee for England|year=2002|format=PDF}}</ref>

Crawley lies in the [[Weald]] between the [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]]. Two beds of [[sedimentary rock]] meet beneath the town: the eastern neighbourhoods and the town centre lie largely on the [[sandstone]] Hastings Beds, while the rest of the town is based on [[Weald Clay]].<ref name="geolmap">{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/sussex.jpg|title=Geology of Surrey and Sussex, after Woodward (1904), based on Reynolds (1860; 1889)|accessdate=2008-04-01|publisher=Ian West and Tonya West|year=2008|work=Geology of Great Britain—an Introduction with Geological Maps (from the website of Southampton University)}}</ref><ref name="Gwynne3–4">{{cite book |last=Gwynne |first=Peter |title=A History of Crawley |origyear=1990 |publisher=Phillimore & Company |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-718-6 |pages=3–4| chapter=Crawley's Site and Situation}}</ref>  A [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]] running from east to west has left an area of Weald Clay (with a ridge of [[limestone]]) jutting into the Hastings Beds around [[Tilgate]].<ref name="Gwynne3–4"/>
The town has no major waterways, although a number of smaller brooks and streams are tributaries for the [[River Mole, Surrey|River Mole]] which rises near Gatwick Airport and flows northwards to the [[River Thames]] near [[Hampton Court Palace]]. There are several lakes at [[Tilgate Park, Crawley|Tilgate Park]] and a mill pond at Ifield which was stopped to feed the Ifield Mill.<ref name="mill">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010149|title=Ifield Mill Pond|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>

There are areas which are not defined as neighbourhoods but which are closely associated with Crawley:
* The [[Manor Royal, Crawley|Manor Royal]] industrial estate is in the north of the town.  Although it is part of the Northgate ward, it is allocated a colour: its street name signs feature the word "Industrial" on a black background.
* Crawley's town centre is in the southernmost part of Northgate.  Its street name signs do not follow the standard format of the neighbourhood signs, but display only the street name.
* [[Gatwick Airport]] was built on the site of a manor house, Gatwick Manor, close to the village of [[Lowfield Heath]].  Most of the village was demolished when the airport expanded, but the [[Listed building|Grade II*-listed]] [[St Michael and All Angels Church, Lowfield Heath|St Michael and All Angels Church]],<ref name="StMLH">{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/diocesesparishes/rcsale/lowfieldheath.html|title=Lowfield Heath St Michael|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=The Archbishops' Council|year=2007|work=The Church of England website}}</ref> remains.

* [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]] was originally a village with its own civil parish, lying just beyond the eastern edge of the Crawley urban area and borough boundary;<ref>{{cite map |publisher= Ordnance Survey|title= Sheet 187: Dorking, Reigate and Crawley|year= 1980|scale= 1:50,000|series= Landranger Series of Great Britain}}</ref> but development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the borough boundary has been extended to include the whole of the village.  The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, as part of the [[Mid Sussex]] district.

[[Image:Crawley - Manor Royal Ind Est.JPG|thumb|right|The junction of Faraday Road and Fleming Way, at the heart of the [[Manor Royal]] industrial estate]]

Crawley originally traded as a market town.  The Development Corporation intended to develop it as a centre for manufacturing and light engineering, with an industrial zone.<ref name="econhist"/> The rapid growth of Gatwick Airport provided opportunities for businesses in the aviation, transport, warehousing and distribution industries. The significance of the airport to local employment and enterprise was reflected by the formation of the Gatwick Diamond partnership.  This venture, supported by local businesses, local government and [[South East England Development Agency|SEEDA]], South East England's [[Regional Development Agency]], aims to maintain and improve the Crawley and Gatwick area's status as a region of national and international economic importance.<ref name="gatdiamond">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatwickdiamond.co.uk/|title=The Gatwick Diamond|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=West Sussex Economic Partnership|year=2007|work=Gatwick Diamond website}}</ref>

Since the [[World War II|Second World War]], unemployment in Crawley has been low: the rate was 1.47% of the working-age population in 2003.<ref name="unemployment">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=INT010610&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&Rendition=Web|title=Unemployment|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2004|work=Crawley Economic Profile 2004|format=PDF}}</ref>  During the boom of the 1980s the town boasted the lowest level of unemployment in the UK.<ref name="hansard">{{cite web | title = Debates for 9 Feb 1989  | work = House of Commons Hansard | publisher = HMSO | year = 1989   | url =http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm198889/cmhansrd/1989-02-09/Debate-4.html  | accessdate = 2007-01-06 }}</ref>  Continuous growth and investment have made Crawley one of the most important business and employment centres in the [[South East England]] region.<ref name="SuppMem"/>

===Manufacturing industry===
Crawley was already a modest industrial centre by the end of the Second World War.  Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories.<ref name="fredgray"/>  In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair.  Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.<ref name="fredgray"/><ref name="econhist"/>

Industrial development had to take place relatively soon after the new town was established because part of the Corporation's remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged London.  Industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community where people could settle.<ref name="NTA1946"/>  The Development Corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base, with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town.

Its advantages included flat land with no existing development; proximity to the London–Brighton railway line, the A23 and the planned M23; space for railway sidings (which were eventually built on a much smaller scale than envisaged); and an adjacent {{convert|44|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} site reserved for future expansion, on the other side of the railway line (again, not used for this purpose in the end).  [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]] (later Queen Elizabeth II) opened the first part of the industrial area on 25 January 1950;<ref name="miscellany"/> its main road was named Manor Royal, and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate.<ref name="econhist"/>  

The Corporation stipulated that several [[Secondary sector of economic activity|manufacturing industries]] should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate.  It did not seek to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms to build their own premises or rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.<ref name="fredgray"/><ref name="econhist"/>

Despite the lack of direct incentives, many firms applied to move to the Manor Royal estate: it was considered such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken.  One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000.<ref name="econhist"/>  By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500.  In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.<ref name="fredgray"/><ref name="econhist"/>

===Service industry and commerce===
While most of the jobs created in the new town's early years were in manufacturing, the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|tertiary sector]] developed strongly from the 1960s.  The Manor Royal estate, with its space, proximity to Gatwick and good transport links, attracted airport-related services such as logistics, catering, distribution and warehousing; and the Corporation and private companies built offices throughout the town.  Office floorspace in the town increased from {{convert|55000|sqft|m2|-2}} in 1965 to a conservative estimate of {{convert|453000|sqft|m2|-2}} in 1984.<ref name="econhist"/> Major schemes during that period included premises for the [[Natwest|Westminster Bank]] (later part of NatWest), [[British Caledonian]], and [[Paymaster-General|The Office of the Paymaster-General]]—a government ministry within the remit of [[HM Treasury]].<ref name="econhist"/>  The five-storey Overline House above the railway station, completed in 1968, is used by Crawley's [[NHS Primary Care Trust]] and various other companies.<ref name="nhs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/Trust.aspx?id=5P6&v=6|title=NHS: West Sussex PCT|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=Department of Health|year=2007|work=NHS Choices: West Sussex PCT (list of sites)}}</ref><ref name="otheroverlinecos">{{Cite web|url=http://www.locallife.co.uk/crawley/jobagencies3.asp|title=Locallife Crawley|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=Locallife Ltd|year=2007|work=Locallife Crawley: Business directory}}</ref>

===Shopping and retail===
[[Image:Crawley - High Street (N).JPG|thumb|right|Crawley High Street looking north, with the Saturday market]]

Even before the new town was planned, Crawley was a retail centre for the surrounding area: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948,<ref name="fredgray"/> 99 of which were on the High Street.<ref name="econhist"/>  Early new town residents relied on these shopping facilities until the Corporation implemented the master plan's designs for a new shopping area on the mostly undeveloped land east of the High Street and north of the railway line.<ref name="NTA1946"/>  The Broadwalk and its 23 shops were built in 1954, followed by the Queen's Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s.<ref name="vicdates"/>  Queen's Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name="fredgray"/>  The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.

[[Image:Crawley - County Mall (Friary Way Entrance).JPG|thumb|left|The Friary Way entrance to County Mall]]

In the 1960s and 1970s, large branches of [[Tesco]], [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Marks & Spencer]] were opened (the Tesco superstore was the largest in Britain at the time). The shopping area was also expanded southeastwards from Queen's Square: although the original plans of 1975 were not implemented fully, several large shop units were built and a new pedestrianised link—The Martlets—was provided between Queen's Square and Haslett Avenue, the main road to Three Bridges.<ref name="econhist"/>  The remaining land between this area and the railway line was sold for private development by 1982;<ref name="econhist"/> in 1992 a {{convert|450000|sqft|m2|-2}}<ref name="CMsize">{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/433|title=Propertymall.com: Crawley, County Mall Shopping Centre|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=MaxiMalls.com Ltd|year=2007|work=www.propertymall.com}}</ref> shopping centre named County Mall was opened there.<ref name="mall">{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=3047252|title=The magnetic North|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Property Week|date=2005-02-25|author=Christine Ease|work=www.propertyweek.com}}</ref> Its stores includes major retailers such as [[Debenhams]], [[Alliance Boots|Boots]], [[W H Smith]] and [[Bhs|British Home Stores]] as well as over 80 smaller outlets.<ref name="shops">{{Cite web|url=http://www.standardlifeweb.co.uk/retailerslist.php?user=countymall&all=true|title=Shopping|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Standard Life Property|year=2007|work=www.countymall.co.uk}}</ref>  The town's main bus station was redesigned, roads including the main A2220 Haslett Avenue were rerouted, and some buildings at the south end of The Martlets were demolished to accommodate the mall.

A regeneration strategy for the town centre, "Centre Vision 2000", was produced in 1993.<ref name="centrevision">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/strategypolicy/int010609.pdf|title=Town Centre Strategy—Consultation Document|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|date=2005-04-27|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>  Changes brought about by the scheme have included {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|-2}} of additional retail space in Queen's Square and The Martlets, and a mixed-use development at the southern end of the High Street on land formerly occupied by Robinson Road (which was demolished) and Spencers Road (shortened and severed at one end).

There are plans to expand Crawley's central shopping area northwards on to land occupied by the Town Hall and office buildings.

The provision of public services was made in co-operation with the local authorities as the town grew in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Transport==
Crawley's early development as a market town was helped by its location on the London–Brighton [[turnpike]].  The area was joined to the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway network]] in the mid-19th century; and since the creation of the new town, there have been major road upgrades (including a [[motorway]] link), a [[guided bus]] transit system and the establishment of an airport which has become one of Britain's largest and busiest.

===Road===
[[Image:M23 Motorway West Sussex.jpg|thumb|right|The M23 motorway between Junctions 9 and 10]]

The London–Brighton turnpike ran through the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road.  When Britain's major roads were classified by the British government's Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923,<ref name="cbrdhistory">{{cite web |url= http://www.cbrd.co.uk/indepth/roadnumbers/history.shtml|title=CBRD In Depth: Road Numbers—How it happened|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=Chris Marshall|year=2001|work=CBRD website}}</ref> it was given the number [[A23 road|A23]].  It was bypassed by a new dual carriageway in 1939 (which forms the A23's current route through the town), and then later to the east side of the town by the [[M23 motorway]], which was opened in 1975.  This connects London's orbital motorway, the [[M25 motorway|M25]], to the A23 at [[Pease Pottage]], at the southern edge of Crawley's built-up area.  The original single-carriageway A23 became the A2219.

The M23 has junctions in the Crawley area at the A2011/[[A264 road|A264]] (Junction 10) and Maidenbower (Junction 10A).  The end of the motorway at Pease Pottage is Junction 11.  The A2011, another dual-carriageway, joins the A23 in West Green and provides a link, via the A2004, to the town centre.  The A2220 follows the former route of the A264 through the town, linking the A23 directly to the A264 at [[Copthorne, West Sussex|Copthorne]], from where it then runs to [[East Grinstead]].

===Rail===
[[Image:Crawley Station 01 (07-07-2007).JPG|thumb|right|Crawley station, with five storeys of offices above the ticket office and concourse area]]

The first railway line in the area was the [[Brighton Main Line]], which opened as far as [[Haywards Heath]] on 12 July 1841 and reached Brighton on 21 September 1841.  It ran through Three Bridges, which was then a small village east of Crawley, and [[Three Bridges railway station|a station]] was built to serve it.<ref name="VicKeithTBB4">{{cite book|last= Mitchell|first= Vic|coauthor= Keith Smith|title= Southern Main Lines: Three Briges to Brighton|year= 1986|publisher= Middleton Press|location= Midhurst|isbn= 0-906520-35-5|pages= 4}}</ref>

===Bus and Fastway===
Crawley was one of several towns where the boundaries of [[Southdown Motor Services]] and [[London Transport Executive|London Transport]] bus services met.  In 1958 the companies reached an agreement which allowed them both to provide services in all parts of the town.  When the [[National Bus Company (UK)|National Bus Company]] was formed in 1969, its [[London Country Bus Services]] subsidiary took responsibility for many routes, including [[Green Line Coaches]] cross-London services which operated to distant destinations such as [[Watford]], [[Luton]] and [[Amersham]].  A coach station was opened by Southdown in 1931 on the A23 at County Oak, near Lowfield Heath: it was a regular stopping point for express coaches between London and towns on the Sussex coast.  This traffic started to serve Gatwick when the airport began to grow, however.<ref name="SouthdownDays">{{cite book |title=Southdown Days |last=Kraemer-Johnson |first=Glyn |coauthors=John Bishop |year=2005 |publisher=Ian Allan Publishing |location=Hersham |isbn=0-7110-3077-4 |chapter=Old Town, New Town |pages=48–55 }}</ref>  When the National Bus Company was broken up, local services were provided by the new [[London Country South West|South West division]] of London Country Bus Services, which later became part of the [[Arriva]] group.

There were proposals to close the airport by the late 1940s, but in 1950 the government announced that it was to be developed as London's second airport.<ref name="Gwynne160">{{cite book |last=Gwynne |first=Peter |title=A History of Crawley |origyear=1990 |publisher=Phillimore & Company |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-718-6 |pages=160| chapter=The New Town—Maturity}}</ref> It was closed between 1956 and 1958 for rebuilding.

An agreement exists between [[BAA Limited|BAA]] and West Sussex County Council preventing the building of a second runway until 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the [[Department for Transport]], at which proposals for additional facilities and runways were considered. It was agreed that there would be no any further expansion at Gatwick unless it became impossible to meet growth targets at [[London Heathrow Airport]] within existing pollution limits.<ref name="dft">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/archive/2002/fd/|title=The future development of air transport in the UK|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=Department for Transport|year=2003|work=Department for Transport website}}</ref>

==Sport and leisure==
[[Crawley Town F.C.]] is Crawley's main [[Association football|football]] team.  Formed in 1896, it moved in 1949 to a ground at Town Mead adjacent to the [[West Green, West Sussex|West Green]] playing fields.

[[Image:Crawley - K2 Leisure Centre 01.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the K2 Leisure Centre]]
The new town's original leisure centre was in Haslett Avenue in the Three Bridges neighbourhood.  Building work started in the early 1960s, and a large swimming pool opened in 1964.  The site was extended to include an athletics arena by 1967, and an additional large sports hall was opened by the town mayor, Councillor Ben Clay, and Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] in 1974.<ref name="wilson">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=PR1579&ssTargetNodeId=99|title=End of an era|accessdate=2007-08-03|year=2005|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref> However, the facilities became insufficient for the growing town, even though an annexe was opened in Bewbush in 1984.<ref name="leisure">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18417|title=Crawley New Town: Social and cultural activities|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=Victoria County History|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P.

The Development Corporation made little provision for the arts in the plans for the new town, and a proposed arts venue in the town centre was never built. Neighbourhood community centres and the Tilgate Forest Recreational Centre were used for some cultural activities,<ref name="leisure"/> but it was not until 1988 that the town had a dedicated theatre and arts venue, at [[The Hawth]].  (The name derives from a local corruption of the word "[[Heath (habitat)|heath]]", which came to refer specifically to the expanse of wooded land, south of the town centre, in which the theatre was built.)<ref name="hawth">{{Cite web|url=https://tickets.hawth.co.uk/public/about_history.asp|title=History Of The Hawth|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=The Hawth, Crawley website}}</ref>  Crawley's earliest cinema, the Imperial Picture House on Brighton Road, lasted from 1909 until the 1940s; the Embassy Cinema on the High Street (opened in 1938) replaced it.<ref name="miscellany"/><ref name="leisure">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18405|title=Ifield|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=Victoria County History|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P.
