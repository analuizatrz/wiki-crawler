'''Michael Shawn Hickenbottom'''<ref name="Shawn Michaels - FAQs"/> (born July 22, 1965),<ref name="slam">{{cite web| url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/michaels-shawn.html|title=Slam! Sports biography|accessdate=2007-07-10|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam! Sports|date=2005-03-12}}</ref> better known by his [[ring name]] '''Shawn Michaels''', is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He performs on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), formerly the World Wrestling Federation. Currently, Hickenbottom is one of the senior performers in WWE, having joined in 1987. He is one of only two wrestlers (the other being [[The Undertaker]]) to have appeared on the very first episode of ''Monday Night Raw'' who are still with the company today.<ref>{{Harv |Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=251}}</ref>

Before joining WWE, Hickenbottom began his wrestling career with [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] and [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA). There, Hickenbottom partnered up with [[Marty Jannetty]] to form [[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]] and won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] on two separate occasions. Hickenbottom and Jannetty then signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), while in contract with AWA. They returned to AWA, only to go back to the WWF in 1988.<ref name="WWEProfile"/>

After signing with WWF, Hickenbottom abandoned the tag team division to work in singles matches and received a new gimmick as "The Heartbreak Kid." He was the leader of a backstage group known as [[Clique (professional wrestling)|The Clique]], which was known for breaking character during the [[Madison Square Garden]] "[[Clique (professional wrestling)#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|Curtain Call]]" incident in 1996.<ref>{{harv|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|p=156}}</ref> The following year, Hickenbottom joined forces with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] and [[Chyna]] to form [[D-Generation X]] (DX). This [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|stable]] was known for pushing the envelope. That same year, Hickenbottom took part in one of the most controversial matches in wrestling history dubbed as the "[[Montreal Screwjob]]." After a back injury forced him to retire following his [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] loss at [[WrestleMania XIV]], Hickenbottom opened a [[Texas Wrestling Academy|wrestling academy]], in which he trained upcoming wrestlers.<ref name="WWEProfile"/> Hickenbottom made his in-ring return at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]] in 2002. In 2006, Hickenbottom and [[Triple H]] briefly reformed DX, but he then returned to singles wrestling.

Overall, Hickenbottom is a four-time world champion: a three-time [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]], and a one-time [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]].<ref name=WWEhistory/> He was also the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995]] and [[Royal Rumble (1996)|1996]] [[Royal Rumble]]s and was the first [[Grand Slam Championship|Grand Slam Champion]].<ref name="WWEProfile"/>

==Early life==
Hickenbottom was born on July 22, 1965 in [[Chandler, Arizona]].<ref name=sm12/> The last of four children—Randy, Scott and Shari. He was raised in a military family and spent a brief part of his early years in [[Reading, Berkshire]], [[England]],<ref name=sm12/> but grew up in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. As a child, Hickenbottom disliked the name "Michael", so his family and friends just called him "Shawn."<ref name=sm18>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=18–19}}</ref> Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military.<ref name=sm18/>

He knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of twelve. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing [[American football|football]].<ref name=sm15>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=15}}</ref> He was a stand-out [[Linebacker]] at [[Randolph High School (Texas)|Randolph High School]] and eventually became Captain of the football team.<ref name="WWEProfile"/><ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=30}}</ref> After graduating, Hickenbottom attended [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Southwest Texas State University]] in [[San Marcos, Texas]], but soon realized that college life was not for him.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=43–49}}</ref> Then he began pursuing the career of a professional wrestler. 

==Career==
===Early career (1984–1988)===
He was then trained by [[Mexico|Mexican]] professional wrestler [[Jose Lothario]].<ref name=stopper/><ref name=sm57/> Lothario suggested that Hickenbottom go by the ring name Shawn Michaels. After his training with Lothario, he debuted in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] in 1984 and later with Texas All-Star Wrestling (TAW) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]].<ref name="HAT"/> During his time with TAW, Michaels and [[Paul Diamond]] were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by [[Chavo Guerrero|Chavo Guerrero, Sr.]]<ref name="slam"/> Hickenbottom also worked for [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]].<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=75–77}}</ref> There, he and tag team partner [[Marty Jannetty]] defeated The Batten Twins for the [[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship|Central States Tag Team Championship]], later losing it back to the Battens.<ref name="slam"/> Hickenbottom also made several appearances in the [[Dallas, Texas]]-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] throughout 1985.

Michaels made his national-level debut at age twenty for the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), once again teaming with [[Marty Jannetty]].<ref name=stopper/> The pair were billed as "[[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]]" and held the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=stopper/> They also appeared in the Mid-South on loan at this point. In a raid of AWA talent in 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).<ref name=stopper/> They were fired from the WWF two weeks later, however, for "partying too hard" (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography).<ref name=stopper/><ref name="sm116"/> They then returned to the AWA, but were re-signed by the WWF a year later.<ref name="sm116">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=116–118}}</ref>

===World Wrestling Federation===
====The Rockers (1988–1991)====
{{main|The Rockers}}
They redebuted for the World Wrestling Federation at a [[house show]] on July 7, 1988.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=133}}</ref> Due to WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive monikers, they were repackaged as simply "[[The Rockers]]."<ref name="HAT"/> The team proved popular with both children and women.<ref name=stopper/> The team was a mid-card stalwart of TV and [[pay-per-view]] shows for the next two years, but never seemed to get a chance at the WWF Tag Team Championships.<ref name=sm148>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=148–150}}</ref>

Belatedly, in October 1990, their chance came when The Rockers were scheduled to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Hart Foundation]], as [[Jim Neidhart]], half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.<ref name=sm148/> The match was taped with The Rockers [[List of professional wrestling slang#C|cleanly]] winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to a stopgap agreement with management and was rehired.<ref name=sm148/> The belts were returned to the Harts, while the title change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on TV.<ref name=sm148/> When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed [[turnbuckle]] in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match.<ref name="HAT"/> The Rockers plodded along, eventually splitting on December 2, 1991 during an incident on [[Edward Leslie|Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake's]] televised "Barber Shop" talk show segment.<ref name=sm159>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=157–159}}</ref> Michaels [[superkick]]ed Jannetty and [[Defenestration|threw him]] through a [[Sugar glass|glass]] window on the "shop" set.<ref name=stopper/> Jannetty vanished from the WWF, and Michaels became a villain as "The Boy Toy."<ref name=sm159/>

====Heartbreak Kid (1992–1995)====
At the suggestion of [[Curt Hennig|"Mr Perfect" Curt Hennig]], Michaels adopted the nickname "The Heartbreak Kid."<ref name=stopper/> Along with his new name came a new [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]] as a vain, cocky villain.<ref name=shining>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_5_2/ai_68951382?tag=artBody;col1|title=7 Superstars Shining Brightly|first=Anderson|last=Steve|publisher=Find Articles.com|work=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=February 2001}}</ref> He was put together with mirror-carrying [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him.<ref name=sm159/> Sherri even sang the first version of his new [[theme music]] "Sexy Boy."<ref name="HAT"/> During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of [[house shows]], and his departure was announced with the words "Shawn Michaels has left the building" (alluding to the phrase "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] has left the building").<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=165–166}}</ref>

Michaels failed to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Bret Hart]] in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first ever [[ladder match]] against him at a [[house show]].<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=161–162}}</ref> He, however, won the title from [[Davey Boy Smith|"The British Bulldog"]] during ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on October 27, 1992.<ref name=IC-title>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/|title=Title History: Intercontinental|accessdate=2008-07-17|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, he was in a pay-per-view main event for the first time, facing—and losing to—future nemesis Bret Hart, for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at the [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=90–91}}</ref> They were moved to the main event after [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]] suddenly departed from the WWF, leaving his tag team match with [[Randy Savage]] against [[Ric Flair]] and [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] hanging.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Baer|first=Randy|coauthors=Reynolds, R.D.|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|date=2003|isbn=1-55022-584-7|pages=74}}</ref>

[[Image:Shawn Michaels in 1994.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Michaels at a live event in 1994]]
During this time, Michaels and Sherri split and his former partner Jannetty quickly reappeared. Michaels lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' on May 17, 1993.<ref name=IC-title/> He then regained it on June 6 with the help of his debuting "[[bodyguard]]" (and off-air friend) [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]].<ref name="HAT"/><ref name=IC-title/>

Michaels quit the WWF in September 1993 after it was announced that he had failed to defend his belt enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for [[steroid]]s—a charge that Michaels denies to this day.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=182}}</ref> After turning down [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW)'s advances, Michaels returned to the WWF and made several appearances in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view, substituting for the arrested [[Jerry Lawler]] in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's "Knights" against Bret, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]], and [[Owen Hart]].<ref name=pwi92>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=91–92}}</ref>

He soon entered a feud with [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], who had won the vacated [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Title]] during Michaels' absence.<ref name="ladderbegin">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=182–187}}</ref> Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt.<ref name="ladderbegin"/> This feud culminated in a [[ladder match]] between the two at [[WrestleMania X]].<ref name="ladderbegin"/> Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.<ref name=pwi92/><ref name="ladderbegin"/> This match was voted by fans as "Match of the Year."<ref name=stopper/> Over the next few months, Michaels battled various injuries and launched the "Heartbreak Hotel" TV talk show segment, mainly shown on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=190}}</ref>

On August 28, 1994, Michaels and [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] captured the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Headshrinkers]].<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=195}}</ref> The next day, at [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]], Diesel lost the Intercontinental title to Ramon when Michaels accidentally [[superkick]]ed his bodyguard.<ref name=pwi92/> This triggered a Michaels-Diesel split, a storyline that was drawn out until the [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]] that November due to Michaels' hand injury.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards| publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=92–93}}</ref> Michaels went on to win the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|Royal Rumble]] in 1995,<ref name=sm196>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=196–199}}</ref> which set up a championship grudge match at [[WrestleMania XI]] against Diesel (who had gone on to win the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] from [[Bob Backland]]).<ref name=sm196/> As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited [[Sid Eudy|Sycho Sid]] as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match,<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Finn|title=Power Slam Magazine, issue 10|work=Tough luck Shawn (WrestleMania XI)|publisher=SW Publishing|date=1995-04-24|pages=20–25}}</ref> and was attacked by Sid the following night.<ref name="Sid attack">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=204}}</ref> After this, Michaels took time off.<ref name="Sid attack"/>

====The Clique's influence (1995–1997)====
He returned to the ring as a crowd favorite in June 1995 and defeated [[Jeff Jarrett]] at July's [[In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks|In Your House]] pay-per-view to win his third Intercontinental title.<ref name=stopper/><ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=209}}</ref> This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]], in a ladder match, which Michaels won.<ref name=stopper/> Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as [[Clique (professional wrestling)|The Clique]].<ref name=stopper/> Others perceived the group to have sufficient clout with WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], becoming dominant wrestling figures in WWF for several years in the mid-1990s. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=206&ndash;208}}</ref> Michaels' fan base was later nicknamed "The Kliq" as an inside reference to the real "Clique."<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=230}}</ref> In October 1995, he was [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] attacked by several men outside a bar in [[Syracuse, New York]].<ref name="HAT"/> Shortly afterwards, at the [[In Your House#In Your House 4: Great White North|In Your House: Great White North]] pay-per-view, Michaels forfeited the Intercontinental title to rival [[Shane Douglas|Dean Douglas]] because he was, according to the WWF, unable to compete.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=213}}</ref> Douglas, however, lost the title immediately to Clique member Razor Ramon.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007| pages=94}}</ref> The next month, during a match with [[Owen Hart]] on an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Owen nailed Michaels with an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|enzuigiri]] kick to the back of Michaels' head.<ref name=sm215>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=215}}</ref> They continued to wrestle, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion in the Syracuse incident.<ref name="HAT"/><ref name=sm215/> The concussion was scripted, which was kept from most fans at the time.<ref name="HAT"/>

[[Image:Hug MSG Incident.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Clique (professional wrestling)#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|The MSG Incident]].]]
After teasing a retirement, Michaels returned to the WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] match in 1996, which he won for the second year in a row.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=95}}</ref> Around this time, [[Jose Lothario]], Michaels' original trainer, became his on-screen manager.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=219}}</ref> Michaels won his first [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[WrestleMania XII]] in March 1996, pinning [[Bret Hart]] in the 'sudden death' overtime of their a sixty minute [[Iron Man match]], which had ended in a 0–0 tie.<ref name=stopper/> As [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] gained momentum due to the signings of Michaels' friends [[Scott Hall]] and [[Kevin Nash]], Michaels held the championship for most of the year. Michaels' title reign ended at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]] in November, where he lost to [[Sid Eudy|Sycho Sid]], his former bodyguard.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=234}}</ref> A flu-ridden Michaels recaptured the belt from Sid in January 1997 at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454115|title=HBK's second WWE title reign|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> 

On a special episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', dubbed ''Thursday Raw Thursday'', Michaels vacated the WWF title;<ref name="HAT"/> he explained to the fans that he was informed by doctors that a knee injury was bad enough that he had to retire.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=239&ndash;240}}</ref> His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at [[WrestleMania 13]] (since it was noted that he was going to have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania).<ref name=stopper/> Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he "had to find his smile again," which he had "lost" somewhere down the line.<ref name=stopper/> After knee surgery by [[James Andrews (physician)|Dr. James Andrews]], Michaels returned a few months later, briefly teaming with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Titles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132122112|title=Stone Cold & Shawn Michaels first World Tag Team title reign|accessdate=2007-07-12|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> Michaels reveals in his autobiography, about his real-life feud with Bret Hart, claiming that Bret did interviews on live television claiming that he (Michaels) was faking his whole injury.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=243&ndash;244}}</ref>

In October, at [[WWE Bad Blood#1997|In Your House: Badd Blood]], Michaels and Undertaker participated in the first [[Hell in a Cell]] match, in which Michaels fell off the side of the {{convert|15|ft|m|0|sing=on}} high structure through a table.<ref name="HIAC1">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=257&ndash;259}}</ref>

In the summer, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend, [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] and Hunter's then-girlfriend, [[Chyna]] to form the [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]], [[D-Generation X]] (DX).<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=252}}</ref> Moving away from the family-oriented product, this marked the beginning of the [[History of professional wrestling#Monday Night Wars 1990s|WWF Attitude Era]].<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=255}}</ref> Michaels also began re-feuding with Bret Hart's reformed [[The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]], which was now a pro-[[Canada]] stable.

'''[[Music in professional wrestling|Entrance themes]]'''
*The song "Sexy Boy" was originally written for Michaels by [[Jimmy Hart]]. Hart thanked Michaels personally for continuing to use the song as his entrance music when he was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2005. Michaels' entrance music was originally performed by [[Sherri Martel]] until she became a crowd favorite.<ref name="HAT"/> The second version was performed by Michaels himself with traces of Sherri in the chorus portion of the song. The current version of the song in use today is the version Michaels sang himself.
*Since the return of [[D-Generation X]], Michaels mostly used the DX entrance "Break It Down", by [[Chris Warren (musician)|The Chris Warren Band]], even when wrestling in singles competition, but then went back to using "Sexy Boy".

==Personal life==
In 1996, Hickenbottom posed in a non-nude layout for ''[[Playgirl]]'' [[magazine]].<ref name="playgirl">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=233}}</ref> It was not until after he posed that he discovered that ''Playgirl'' has a mostly homosexual readership, which was seen as humorous by his fellow wrestlers.<ref name="playgirl"/>

Hickenbottom's marriage to his first wife, Theresa Wood, was brief and ended in divorce, but was amicably settled.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=194}}</ref> He is now married to former WCW [[Nitro Girls|Nitro Girl]], Whisper (Rebecca Curci). They were married on March 31, 1999 at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=296}}</ref> It was a very small wedding ceremony. The only people present were Hickenbottom, Rebecca Curci, and an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] impersonator. Hickenbottom and Curci have a son, Cameron Kade (born on January 5, 2000)<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=304}}</ref> and a daughter, Cheyenne Michelle (born on August 19, 2004).<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=329}}</ref>

Hickenbottom has several tattoos. He has a tattoo of a heart with a sword through it with a snake around it in the shape of an "S."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/shawnmichaels/photos1/2007rawphotos/020507hbk2.jpg|title=An image of HBK|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref name="HBK superstar ink">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/superstarink/articles/hbksuperstardomandsalvationinink|title=Shawn Michaels: Superstardom and salvation in ink|date=2008-03-13|last=Zeigler|first=Zack|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> He has one on his wedding finger, that has an ''R'' for his wife Rebecca.<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/> Another in his left wrist, it's a bracelet design that says "Cameron" for his son.<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/> On his left leg he has a picture of his wife,<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/> the other leg has a picture of the state of Texas.<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/> Finally, he has a small broken heart with the letters "HBK" above it, tattooed on his right hip.<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/>

Hickenbottom is [[cross-dominance|ambidextrous]].<ref name=sm15/> This caused him problems as a boy playing football, as he had trouble differentiating between his right and left directions.<ref name=sm15/> He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write.<ref name=sm15/> He typically uses his right leg when performing Sweet Chin Music.

Hickenbottom is a [[Born again (Christianity)|born again Christian]]. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, but became a non-denominational Christian under the influence of his wife Rebecca.<ref name="HAT"/> His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of [[Cornerstone Church]] in his hometown of San Antonio. Hickenbottom is a [[Bible]] teacher in San Antonio.<ref name="HAT"/> He also appeared on a [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] (TBN) program along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tbn.org/about/newsletter/index.php/793.html|title=TBN Newsletter|accessdate=2008-07-17|publisher=[[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]}}</ref>

Hickenbottom is a fan of the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He has been seen wearing Spurs merchandise and attending Spurs games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/overtheropes/circleofchampions/articlephotos/triplehdetroit/|title=Image of HBK|accessdate=2008-06-13|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] (JBL) made a reference to Hickenbottom being a season ticket holder during the [[Royal Rumble (2007)|2007 Royal Rumble]].<ref>{{cite video|year=2007|title=Royal Rumble 2007|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref>
