'''Bradford "Brad" Rutter''' (born [[January 31]], [[1978]]) is best known as a contestant on the U.S. [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[game show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. As of 2008, [[American_game_show_winnings_records#All_Time_Winnings_List| he has won more money on a game show than any other person in history]].
Rutter became an undefeated five-time champion on ''Jeopardy!'' in 2000 and has since won an unprecedented three ''Jeopardy!'' tournament titles: the 2001 [[Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions|Tournament of Champions]], the [[Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters|Million Dollar Masters Tournament]], and the [[Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions|Ultimate Tournament of Champions]].  In the finals of the Ultimate Tournament, Rutter decisively defeated [[Ken Jennings]] and [[Jerome Vered]] to become the show's biggest money winner to date, with total earnings of $3,270,102.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

In twenty games, Rutter has never lost a full match of ''Jeopardy!''  (Rutter has trailed at the end of the first game of a two-day match twice&mdash;against Rick Knutsen in the first game of the Finals of the 2001 Tournament of Champions, and against John Cuthbertson in the first game of the semifinals of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions&mdash;but he ultimately won both of those matches with a higher two-day cumulative score.)  Given his unequaled records and crushing victories over otherwise highly successful ''Jeopardy!'' champions (such as Jennings, Vered, Eric Newhouse, Bob Verini, Doug Lach, Tad Carithers, John Beck, and Chris Miller), Rutter is widely considered the greatest ''Jeopardy!'' player of the Trebek era.

Until 2007, Rutter lived in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], where he hosted ''[http://www.inquizitive.com/ InQuizitive]'', a locally broadcast quiz show for [[high school]] students.  He has also been a reader and judge for the high school [[National Academic Championship]].

Rutter is a 1995 graduate of Manheim Township High School in [[Neffsville, Pennsylvania]], where he was on the [[Quiz Bowl]] team.  He is one of the 18 people to have been named to the [[National Academic Championship]] Hall of Fame in its 25-year history.  At the 2005 Manheim Township High School graduation ceremony, he announced the start of a scholarship fund in memory of his late high-school quiz bowl coach.  

Rutter has described himself as a "slacker" in high school and a [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] dropout (while there, he studied [[English studies|English]] and [[History]]).  Before his success on ''Jeopardy!'', he worked at the [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] [[Trans World Entertainment|Coconuts record store]].  

He appeared on the U.S. game show ''[[1 vs. 100]]'' (as a member of "the Mob") on December 1, 2006 and again on December 8, 2006. He answered every question correctly and was one of only seven mob members to survive to the next show, as was [[Annie Duke]]. He would eventually be eliminated on the December 15th episode, on a question about Jewish reggae musician [[Matisyahu]]. He again appeared on February 9, 2007 and was eliminated late into a winner-takes-$250,000 "last man standing" competition, but before Ken Jennings.

Rutter was the top seed in ''[[Grand Slam (US TV series)|Grand Slam]]'', but lost in the second round to [[Ogi Ogas]], a former ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' contestant. This marks the very first time that Rutter has ever lost on a televised game show. Rutter was one of four former ''Jeopardy!'' champions on "Grand Slam"; the others were #13 seed Leszek Pawlowicz, #12 seed [[Frank Spangenberg]], and Jennings, seeded second.
