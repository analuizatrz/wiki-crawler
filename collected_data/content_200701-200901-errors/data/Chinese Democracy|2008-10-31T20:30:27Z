{{main|History of Chinese Democracy}}
{{seealso|Chinese Democracy Tour}}
Preparations for ''Chinese Democracy'' began in 1994. Ex-bassist [[Duff McKagan]] is quoted as saying, "[the] band was so splintered at that point that nothing got started".<ref name="time off">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoff.com.au/index.php?area=Interviews&pg=38&subarea=38&sel=6127&PHPSESSID=b1255c323c0977e85e64fe287a9f7654=

In early 1998, the band — which comprised Rose, Finck, Stinson and Freese along with long-time Guns N' Roses associate [[Paul Tobias]], keyboardists [[Dizzy Reed]] and [[Chris Pitman]] — began recording at Rumbo Recorders, a state-of-the-art studio in the [[San Fernando Valley]] where Guns N' Roses had partially recorded parts for their debut album, ''Appetite for Destruction''. During this time, [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] paid Rose [[United States dollar|$]]1 million to try to finish the album, with a further $1 million if he handed it in to them by March 1, 1999.<ref name="NY Times" />

In 2000, Rose hired [[avant-garde metal]] guitarist [[Buckethead]], and drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]] to replace the departed Freese. Later on in 2000, Finck rejoined the band as the third guitarist. On January 1, 2001, Guns N' Roses played their first concert in over seven years at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. This was followed by their headlining performance at [[Rock in Rio|Rock in Rio III]] on January 14, 2001 in front of 190,000 people.<ref name="Rio review">{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1437951/20010115/story.jhtml

On December 14, 2006, Rose published an open letter to the band's fans on their website, claiming that remaining tour's shows were taking up time the band needed to finish recording ''Chinese Democracy''. Rose also revealed that the band had parted company with their manager Merck Mercuriadis, implying that the reason the album wasn't released in 2006 was Mercuriadis's fault (many times throughout 2006, Rose had said the album would be released that year). In the letter, Rose announced a tentative release date of March 6, 2007 for the album, however, the album was once again delayed.<ref name="Axl's open letter" /><ref name="Merck's letter">{{cite web| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=84502| title =  Former Guns N' Roses Manager: 'I Believe In Axl Rose' | accessdate = 2007-12-22| date=  2006-12-15| publisher = Mercuriadis, Merck}}</ref>

===Sound===
In 1999, the [[industrial metal]] song "[[Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)|Oh My God]]" was released on the ''[[End of Days (1999 film)|End of Days]]'' soundtrack. It featured current Guns N' Roses members [[Axl Rose]], [[Dizzy Reed]], [[Robin Finck]], [[Chris Pitman]] and [[Tommy Stinson]], along with  former members [[Paul Tobias]] and [[Josh Freese]]. [[Dave Navarro]] and Gary Sunshine also recorded guitar parts for the song. "Oh My God" was unpopular upon its release, and was described by [[Allmusic]] as "a less than satisfying comeback".<ref name="NY Times" /><ref name="AMG-EoD">{{cite web|url=http://wc02.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:fxfrxqwkld0e|title=All Music Guide: End of Days - Overview|accessdate=2006-11-17|author=Erlewine, Stephen|publisher=''[[All Media Guide]]''}}</ref> The sound of ''Chinese Democracy'' was often reported to be industrial rock music similar to [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], a style that Rose had long been a fan of. However, in a 2001 interview with an Argentine radio station, Rose stated the album wasn't industrial, and would vary in styles:
{{cquote|It is not industrial, the closest thing to that was perhaps "Oh My God", but there are some songs that won't be on the album that were this way.

In 2003, DJ [[Eddie Trunk]] spoke about the demo of "I.R.S." which was leaked on his radio show:
{{cquote|It reminded me of Use Your Illusion-era stuff, with some modern flairs to it. The song had a loop track in the beginning, but then, when it kicked in, it was that same dramatic Guns N' Roses hard rock.<ref name="MTV Trunk">{{cite web

During the launch party for [[Korn]]'s 2006 tour, Rose conducted an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he told the magazine:
{{cquote|It's a very complex record, I'm trying to do something different. Some of the arrangements are kind of like [[Queen (band)|Queen]].

In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article in 2006, former [[Skid Row (heavy metal band)|Skid Row]] frontman [[Sebastian Bach]] described the album as "epic" and "mind-blowing" and added:
{{cquote|It’s a very cool album - it’s badass with killer screams, killer guitar riffs, but it’s got a totally modern sound. The word for it is ‘grand.’ It’s fucking epic.

Bach also described a song titled "Sorry":
{{cquote|There’s this one song called ‘Sorry’ that’s almost like [[doom metal]] with Axl singing really clean over this grinding, slow beat that is fucking mean, I cannot get it out of my head.<ref name="DiS-Bach" />}}

==Delays==
According to a March 2005 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, production costs for the album have reached $13 million, making it probably the most expensive recording "never made".<ref name="NY Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/arts/music/06leed.html?ei=5090&en=a13c0fac87670850&ex=1267851600&adxnnl=1&partner=rssuserland&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1195322585-YcO/12l8xR/GIod6+bXFQA

Rose issued a press release on Guns N' Roses' official website on December 14, 2006. Entitled "An open letter to the fans from Axl", Rose announced the cancellation of four concerts that were scheduled for January 2007, he stated that if the band fulfilled the concerts, "valuable time needed by the band and record company for the proper setup and release of the album ''Chinese Democracy'' would have been lost". Also in the letter, he confirmed that Guns N' Roses had parted company with manager Merck Mercuriadis. Rose blamed much of the album's delay on Mercuriadis. Rose also announced a tentative release date for ''Chinese Democracy'' of March 6, 2007, he remarked that it was the first time the band had publicly named a release date for the album.<ref name="Axl's open letter">{{cite web|url=http://www.newgnr.com/articles/axlletter121506.html|title=An open letter from Axl Rose|publisher=GunsNRoses.com|author=Rose, Axl|date=2006-12-14|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

Despite Rose's announcement, the album was once again delayed. On February 22, 2007, the band's road manager, [[Del James]], issued a press release definitively stating that all recording for the album had been completed.  James elaborated, "There is no official release date, as the band is currently mixing, but after some delays and scheduling difficulties, things appear to be moving along."<ref name="DelJames">{{cite web|url=http://web.gunsnroses.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070222&content_id=a1&vkey=news&fext=.jsp

In a 2007 interview, Sebastian Bach claimed Rose had planned to have the album released by Christmas 2007: "I know Axl was very serious about putting something out before Christmas. He was talking to me about it. He was talking about finishing liner notes." Bach also said that ''Chinese Democracy'''s delay might be because of business problems: "I think there's a lot of business shit that goes on with him. It's just not as easy. It's a little more complicated than people think."<ref name="Bach interview - RMM">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockmymonkey.com/interviews/07/11/SebastianBach.php|title=Rock My Monkey - Sebastian Bach Interview|publisher=Rock My Monkey|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> Little was said about the record after this, and 2007 saw no official release of the new material.

In January 2008, rumors arose that ''Chinese Democracy'' had been handed over to Geffen Records, but had been delayed because the label and Rose could not agree on the marketing of the album.<ref name="antimusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/08/jan/10GNR_Finish_CD.shtml|title=GNR Finish CD?|publisher=antiMusic|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> [[Eddie Trunk]] also claimed Geffen might have the album: "I hear the new G&R CD is actually done, but the delay in release is not the bands{{sic}} issues but the label.  There is so much money tied up in this record that in todays{{sic}} business it will be virtually impossible to be profitable, meaning the label might want to sell it off but can not find a buyer since nobody buys CDs anymore. Problem might not be Axl this time around and might keep this CD in limbo for more years to come. Hopefully it gets resolved."<ref name="Eddie Trunk blog">{{cite web|url=http://www.eddietrunk.com/blog.php|title=Eddie Trunk - Trunk Blog|author=Trunk, Eddie|publisher=Eddietrunk.com|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> However, in a February 2008 interview with Classic Rock Magazine, Rose's personal manager, Beta Lebeis, debunked Trunk's suggestion and  was quoted as saying "we're currently in negotiations with the record label".<ref name="Classic Rock article 2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/page/classicrock?entry=it_s_a_fact|title=It's a Fact|publisher=Classic Rock Magazine|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref>

==Controversy and lawsuits==
In 2004, Geffen Records released ''[[Greatest Hits (Guns N' Roses album)|Greatest Hits]]''. Rose, along with Slash and McKagan, attempted to block the album's release. They filed a lawsuit against Geffen, claiming the album was unauthorized and would damage the band's reputation, Rose also claimed it would distract the band from completing ''Chinese Democracy''. A week before the scheduled release, a judge denied their request for an injunction and the album was released.<ref name="AMG-GH">{{cite web|url=http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:8iazqjkwojha=

===Title conflicts===
On April 1, 2003, [[The Offspring]] announced that they would be naming their upcoming album ''Chinese Democrazy<!-- Note: This is the correct title - see the ref. --> (You Snooze, You Lose)''.

Axl ripped off my braids, I ripped off his album title."<ref name="offspring">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470891/20030401/story.jhtml | title = Guns N' Roses' ''Chinese Democracy'' Snatched By Offspring | accessdate = 2007-01-08 | last = D'Angelo | first = Joe | date=  2003-04-01 | work = MTV.com}}</ref> However, it turned out to be an April Fools' joke and the Offspring album was eventually released under the title ''[[Splinter (The Offspring album)|Splinter]]'' instead.
