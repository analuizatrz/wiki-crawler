'''Lethbridge''' is a city in the province of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It is Alberta's fourth largest city by population after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]]. At 127.19&nbsp;km² (49.1 sq. mi.), it is the third largest in area after Calgary and Edmonton. The city is near the [[Canadian Rockies]], which provides the city with mild winters and a [[Chinook wind|windy climate]], and is 210&nbsp;km (130 miles) southeast of Calgary on the [[Oldman River]]. 

The city developed from [[Drift mining|drift mines]] opened in the late [[19th century|nineteenth century]] and [[agriculture]] in the early [[20th century|twentieth century]]. It has grown into the commercial, financial, transportational and industrial centre of [[southern Alberta]]. Lethbridge provides the only university in Alberta south of Calgary, and two of the three colleges in southern Alberta have campuses in the city. There are several cultural venues in the city, including performing art theatres, museums and sports centres.

==History==
{{main|History of Lethbridge}}
After the US Army outlawed alcohol trading in 1869 with the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation|Blackfeet Nation]] in Montana, traders [[John Healy|John J. Healy]] and [[Alfred Hamilton|Alfred B. Hamilton]] started the whiskey trading post Fort Hamilton, which later came to be nicknamed [[Fort Whoop-Up]].<ref name="Ellis">{{cite web |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/Short+History.htm |title=A Short History of Lethbridge, Alberta| author=Greg Ellis |month=October |year=2001 |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>

The whiskey trade eventually lead to the [[Cypress Hills massacre]] of many [[Assiniboine]] in 1873. As a result, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North West Mounted Police]] arrived in the area to stop the trade and establish order.<ref name="Ellis"/> The NWMP arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on [[9 October]] [[1874]], and they continued to host a post and trade for the following 12 years.<ref name="Ellis"/>

Lethbridge developed from drift mines opened by [[Nicholas Sheran]] ([[1874]]) and the [[North Western Coal and Navigation Company]] ([[1882]]), whose president was [[William Lethbridge]], from whom the city derives its name.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Battle Park |publisher=City of Lethbridge |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/Parks+-+Pathways+-+Trails/Major+Parks/Indian+Battle+Park/Indian+Battle+Park.htm |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> By the twentieth century, the mines employed about 150 men and produced about 300 tonnes of coal each day.<ref name="Ellis"/> By the time production peaked during [[World War I]], local collieries were the largest coal producers in the [[Northwest Territories]].<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/History+of+Lethbridge/Masonry+Sculptures/Masonry.htm City of Lethbridge website]</ref> Because of increased oil and natural gas production after the war, coal production declined,<ref name="Ellis"/> and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957. 

The first rail line in Lethbridge was built on [[28 August]] [[1885]] by the [[Alberta Railway and Coal Company]],<ref name="Ellis" /> five years before they purchased the North Western Coal and Navigation Company.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alberta Railway and Coal Company |work=Table of Private Acts (1867 to December 31, 2006), Railways |publisher=Department of Justice Canada |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/privlaw/214797/2525.html |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> Because of the rail industry's dependence of coal and the CPR's immigration efforts to settle southern Alberta, Lethbridge became instrumental in the economic success of the region. After the CPR moved the divisional point of its Crowsnest Line from Fort Macleod to Lethbridge in 1905, the city became a regional centre for [[Southern Alberta]]; something the region did not have previously.<ref name="Ellis"/> In the mid-1980s, CPR moved the rail yards in downtown Lethbridge to nearby [[Kipp, Alberta|Kipp]] and Lethbridge ceased operating as a hub for rail traffic in the province.<ref>{{cite web |title=Executive Summary |work=Highways 3 & 4, Lethbridge and Area NHS & NSTC, Functional Planning Study, #R - 970 |publisher=Stantec Consulting Ltd. |date=February 2006 |url=http://www.infratrans.gov.ab.ca/INFTRA_Content/docType182/Production/exec_summ.pdf |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

Between 1907 and 1913, a development boom occurred in Lethbridge, making it the main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta.<ref name="Ellis"/> Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, a power plant, a [[Lethbridge Transit|streetcar system]], and [[Exhibition Park (Lethbridge)|exhibition buildings]], as well as a construction boom and rising real estate prices transformed the mining town into a significant city.<ref name="Ellis"/>

Between World War I and [[World War II]], however,  the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak before 1920.<ref name="Ellis"/> Following World War II, irrigation in the surrounding area caused the city's population to swell, which in turn boosted the local economy. Lethbridge Community College (now [[Lethbridge College]]) opened in April 1957, and the [[University of Lethbridge]] in 1967.<ref name="Ellis"/>

==Government==
[[Image:Lethbridge City Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Lethbridge City Hall]]
{{seealso|Lethbridge City Council}}
Lethbridge's local government consists of eight elected councillors, who along with the [[List of mayors of Lethbridge, Alberta|mayor]], make up the [[Lethbridge City Council]]. Lethbridge elects a new government every three years, in October. The City of Lethbridge has an operating budget of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 million, more than half of which comes from [[property tax]].<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/DDEC3079-A129-49FD-AF56-EAB1E41CBDEB/4462/BudgetPresentation0608BudgetOverview.pdf 2006–2008 Preliminary Operating Budget Overview], City of Lethbridge</ref>

Lethbridgians elect representatives to the federal, provincial, and municipal levels of government. One Member of Parliament (MPs) representing [[Lethbridge (electoral district)|Lethbridge]] sits in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] in [[Ottawa]], and two members of Alberta's [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|legislative assembly]] (MLAs), representing [[Lethbridge East]] and [[Lethbridge West]], sit in the legislative assembly in Edmonton. Being Alberta's fourth most populous city, many provincial offices are located in the city.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Lethbridge south alberta.gif|thumb|right|300px|Map of southern Alberta.]]
The city of Lethbridge is located at degrees 49.7° north [[latitude]] and -112.833° east [[longitude]], and it covers an area of 127.19&nbsp;km². The city is divided by the [[Oldman River]], the valley of which has been turned into one of the largest [[Oldman River valley parks system|urban park systems]] in [[North America]] at 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) of protected land.<ref>{{cite web |title=2007 National Fair Program Preview |work=Historica Fairs |publisher=Historica |url=http://www.histori.ca/fairs/default.do?page=.main_ob&section=fairs&rinfo=sb_sas&cont=overview |accessdate=2007-02-16 }}</ref> The city is Alberta's fourth largest by population after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]].

[[Image:Lethbridge map.gif|thumb|left|200px|Map of Lethbridge]]
Lethbridge is split into three geographical areas: north, south and [[West Lethbridge|west]]. The [[Oldman River]] separates West Lethbridge from the other two. The [[Crowsnest Highway]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail line separate North and South Lethbridge.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=Faron |title=Alberta Provincial Election Study |publisher=Citizen-Society Research Lab |date=November 2004 |url=http://www.lethbridgecollege.ab.ca/departments/research/csrl/pdf/Fall2004ProvincialElectionII.pdf |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> The newest of the three areas, West Lethbridge (pop. 27,154)<ref name="2006-pop">[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/C86CA863-3BDA-4D96-AD15-CCC9BC56C934/5794/MEDIARELEASECensusResults2006.pdf City of Lethbridge], "Lethbridge Census 2006 - City population up 1.96% per cent since 2005", 25 May 2006</ref> is home to the [[University of Lethbridge]].

The north side (pop. 23,241)<ref name="2006-pop"/> was originally populated because of numerous coal mines in the area. It has the oldest population of the three areas and is home to multiple industrial parks; it also includes the former town of Hardieville, which was annexed by Lethbridge some years ago.<ref>{{cite web |title=William Duncan Livingstone Hardie |publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |url=http://www.coalking.ca/people/profiles/lethbridge_hardie.html |accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>. South Lethbridge (pop. 28,318)<ref name="2006-pop"/> is the commercial heart of the city. It contains the [[Downtown Lethbridge|downtown core]], as well as the bulk of retail and hospitality establishments. [[Lethbridge College]] is also located here.

===Climate===
Lethbridge has a moderate continental climate with an average maximum temperature of 12.3°[[Celsius|C]] (54.14°[[Farenheit|F]]) and an average minimum temperature of -1°C (30.2°F). Average precipitation amounts to 386.3&nbsp;mm (15.21&nbsp;in), but it has the most number of dry days of any city in the country after [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]].<ref name="winners" /> Lethbridge has an average wind speed of 18.20&nbsp;km/h (11.31&nbsp;mph) and places second in the country for the most windy days of 40&nbsp;km/h or more.<ref name="winners">[http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/intro-e.html Weather Winners], Environment Canada. Accessed [[26 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

As a result of its high elevation of 929&nbsp;m (3,048&nbsp;ft) and close proximity to the Rocky Mountains, Lethbridge's summers are relatively cooler than most other locations in the prairies.<ref name="bus-inv-profile">[http://www.chooselethbridge.ca/media/publication_1.pdf  Business Investment Profile 2005/2006], Economic Development Lethbridge. 2005. Accessed 7 November 2006.</ref> These factors also protect the city from strong northwest and southwest winds and contribute to frequent [[chinook wind|chinooks]] during the winter. Lethbridge winters have the highest temperatures in the prairies.<ref name="chamber">[http://lethbridgechamber.com/community.php Community Profile], Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce.

Wults |title=Lethbridge, Alta |work=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada |publisher=Historica |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0002050 |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> Vox Musica is a community choir based at the [[University of Lethbridge]] and has been performing since 1984. Lethbridge also features a small, but strong independent music scene. Various local pubs and nightclubs regularly host local acts.

===Theatre===
In addition to productions presented by the University of Lethbridge's theatre department, Lethbridge is also home to the New West Theatre, which produces a season of seven shows annually including original music revues and new Canadian drama. New West Theatre performs at the [[Genevieve E. Yates Memorial Centre]], using its two theatres: the 500-seat [[proscenium]] Yates Theatre and the 180-seat [[Black box theatre|black box]] Sterndale Bennet Theatre.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |publisher=New West Theatre |url=http://www.newwesttheatre.com/aboutus.php |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

==Sports and recreation==
[[Image:Henderson Lake.jpg|thumb|right|Henderson Lake]]
As with any other urban area, the city has numerous recreational facilities. In fact, 16% of the land within city boundaries is designated parkland.<ref>{{cite web  | coauthors = Stantec Consulting| title = Bikeways and Pathways Master Plan | publisher = City of Lethbridge | date = March 2007 | url = http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/Parks+-+Pathways+-+Trails/Whats+New/What+New.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-28 }}</ref> In addition to those already listed above, Lethbridge has facilities for field sports and [[Henderson Stadium|baseball]].  It has a [[Nicholas Sheran Park|disc golf course]], a skate park, a BMX track, a climbing wall, a dozen tennis courts, seven pools, and a 755 hectare (1,865 acre) [[Oldman River valley parks system|urban park system]]. It is also home to three golf courses (including the award-winning Paradise Canyon Golf Resort) and within 30&nbsp;km of several others.<ref name="choose-leth-rec"/>

Built for the [[1975 Canada Games]], the [[ENMAX Centre]] is Lethbridge's multipurpose arena. The 6,500-seat facility has hosted concerts, three-ring circuses, multicultural events, national curling championships, basketball events, banquets, skating events and the [[Lethbridge Hurricanes]], a major WHL franchise. Some of the features of the arena are a running track, racquetball and squash courts, and a full-size ice rink.<ref>{{cite web |title=ENMAX Centre |publisher=City of Lethbridge |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/ENMAX+Centre/default.htm |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> There is also an outdoor sports field with capacity for 2,000 people adjacent to the centre. In 1997, the 58,000 square foot [[Community Savings Place]] (formerly the Lethbridge Soccer Centre) was built directly south of the ENMAX Centre and added two regulation size indoor soccer pitches to the complex.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lethbridge Soccer Centre |publisher=City of Lethbridge |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/Leisure+and+Recreation+Services/Other+Recreational+Facilities/Soccer+Centre/Lethbridge+Soccer+Centre.htm |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

==Major attractions==
[[Image:lethbridge_Viaduct.gif|thumb|right|High Level Bridge near downtown Lethbridge.]]
The [[Lethbridge Viaduct]], commonly known as the ''High Level Bridge'', is the longest and tallest viaduct bridge in the world. Construction was completed in [[1909]] on what was then the western edge of the city. The bridge is often displayed on tourist postcards and official city publications.

[[Indian Battle Park]], located in the [[coulee]]s of the [[Oldman River]], commemorates the last battle between the [[Cree]] and the [[Blackfoot]] [[First Nations]] in [[1870]].

[[Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden]], located in south Lethbridge, was opened in [[1967]] in celebration for the Canadian centennial. It was a royal event with [[Japan]]’s Prince and Princess [[Prince Takamatsu|Takamatsu]] leading a list of special guests.

[[Image:Fort Whoop-Up.jpg|thumb|left|Fort-Whoop Up in Lethbridge.]]
[[Fort Whoop-Up]] was also known as Fort Hamilton; during the late [[19th century|1800s]] it served as a centre for various illegal activities. Fort Whoop-Up was first built in [[1869]] by J.J. Healy and A.B. Hamilton with the purpose of being a whiskey post. Its first structure was destroyed by fire within a year of its construction — whether this was an accident or deliberate arson is unknown. A second, more sturdy structure later replaced Fort Whoop-Up. 

[[Galt Museum & Archives]] is the largest museum in the Lethbridge area. Its building once served as the main hospital in the city during the late 1800s and early [[20th century|1900s]]. It has an extensive collection of archives and hosts exhibits. Between 2004–2006, it underwent major renovation, which included a 5,000-square foot exhibit centre, a larger store, and a 2,500-square foot education centre.

[[Paradise Canyon Golf Resort]], located in the city's southwest, is a world-class golf course with amenities available in larger cities. The eighteen-hole course lies alongside of the Oldman River, and is often prone to damage from spring floods.

===Skyline===
[[Image:Lethbridge skyline.jpg|thumb|right|Skyline of downtown Lethbridge.]]
There are several prominent structures on Lethbridge's skyline, some of which are unique to the city. One prominent landmark is the [[Lethbridge Post Office|post office]]. While not as widely recognized as the High Level Bridge, it is one of the most unique buildings in Lethbridge, especially when compared to other buildings in southern Alberta. The four-storey building was built at the turn of the 20th century and is crowned by a functioning clock tower.

The remainder of prominent buildings in Lethbridge's [[Downtown Lethbridge|downtown]] skyline consist of several office towers. In addition, some other prominent landmarks outside of downtown are the [[Lethbridge Water Tower|water tower]], which was originally built in 1958 and sold to a private developer who converted it into a restaurant, and the Alberta Terminals grain elevators.

==Education==
Grades Kindergarten through 12 are administered in Lethbridge by the public [[Lethbridge School District No. 51|Lethbridge School District]] and the Catholic [[Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Separate Regional Division No. 4|Holy Spirit Division]]. Lethbridge is also home to one of the three campuses of the [[Third Academy]] private school.

Lethbridge is home to [[Lethbridge College]],  founded in [[1957]], and the [[University of Lethbridge]], founded in [[1967]]. In addition, a campus of [[Red Crow Community College]] is located in the city. During the 2003–2004 school year, the post secondary student population in the city was approximately 14,000 at both the University of Lethbridge and the Lethbridge Community College, which is roughly 20% of the city's population.<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/D4CEB98B-9F18-4786-870D-84A06E1533FC/310/LethbridgeProfile2003.pdf Lethbridge Profile, 2003–2004], City of Lethbridge</ref>

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Lethbridge}}
Mass transit in Lethbridge consists of forty buses (with an average age of ten years) covering most of the city on over a dozen routes.<ref>{{cite news |date=[[2006-09-09]] |title=Richard keeps the city's buses on the road |publisher=Lethbridge Herald |first=Dave |last=Mabell |language=English |page=A4}}</ref> Traditionally, all bus routes in the city started and ended downtown. In the early twenty-first century, however, [[Lethbridge Transit]] introduced cross-town and shuttle routes.

The Parks and Recreation department maintains the citywide, thirty-kilometre, pedestrian/cyclist [[Coal Banks Trail]] system ([http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/12EB4100-4704-49B2-85B1-26053A428E37/733/Coal_Banks.pdf map]). The system was designed to connect the [[Oldman River]] valley with other areas of the city, including Pavan Park in the north, Henderson Lake in the east, [[Alberta provincial highway 4|highways 4]] and [[Alberta provincial highway 5|5]] in the south and a loop in West Lethbridge (including University Drive and McMaster Blvd).<ref>{{cite web |title=Coal Banks Trail |publisher=City of Lethbridge |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/Parks+-+Pathways+-+Trails/Pathways+and+Trails/Coal+Banks+Trail/Coal+Banks+Trail.htm |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

Four provincial highways ([[Crowsnest Highway|3]], 4, 5, and [[Alberta provincial highway 25|25]]) run through or terminate in Lethbridge. This has led to the creation of major arterial roads (including Mayor Magrath Drive, University Drive and Scenic Drive). This, and the fact Lethbridge is located on the [[CANAMEX Corridor]], has led to Lethbridge being a major shipping destination, with many shipping lines having depots located in the city.<ref name="chamber"/>

Lethbridge is 100&nbsp;km (62 miles) north of the [[United States]] border via highways 4 and 5; and 210&nbsp;km (130 miles) south of [[Calgary]] via [[Alberta provincial highway 2|highways 2]] and 3. Highways 2, 3 and 4 form part of the [[CANAMEX]] trade route between [[Mexico]], the [[United States]], and Canada.<ref name="chamber"/>

In addition to its road service, Lethbridge is very close to the [[Lethbridge County Airport]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail yards in [[Kipp, Alberta|Kipp]]. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, just west of the city, from downtown Lethbridge in [[1983]] to make way for commercial expansion.<ref>[http://www.crowsnest-highway.ca/cgi-bin/citypage.pl?city=COALHURST Coalhurst, Alberta : History], The Virtual Crowsnest Highway. Accessed [[26 December]] [[2006]].</ref> The county airport provides commercial flights to several Alberta cities (such as [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]) and [[Mexico]], as well as private and charter flights to various other destinations. The airport also provides customs services for any flights coming in from the United States.
