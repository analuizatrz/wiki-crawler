[[Image:OctopusFrontNew.jpg|thumb|250px|Obverse side of a standard adult card.]]The '''Octopus card''' is a rechargeable [[contactless]] stored value [[smart card]] used to transfer [[electronics|electronic]] payments in online or offline systems in [[Hong Kong]]. Originally launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the city's [[mass transit system]], the Octopus card system has grown into a widely used payment system for virtually all public [[transport in Hong Kong]]. It is also used for making payment at [[convenience store]]s, [[supermarket]]s, [[fast-food restaurant]]s, on-street [[parking meter]]s, [[car park]]s, and many other [[point-of-sale]] applications such as [[filling station|service stations]] and [[vending machine]]s. In addition, the system is used for [[access control]] to offices, schools and apartments. Some charities even accept Octopus cards for donations. Making a payment involves placing the card in close proximity to an Octopus card reader; a tone from the reader will confirm that the merchant has received funds. Cards can be recharged with cash at add-value machines in subway and rail stations, in over-the-counter in stores such as [[7-Eleven]], [[Wellcome]], and [[Circle K]], or directly through [[credit card]]s and [[bank account]]s.

Octopus has become one of the world's most successful electronic cash systems, with over 14 million Octopus cards in circulation (twice Hong Kong's population), ten million transactions per day, 420 service vendors, and 50,000 processors.<ref>[http://www.octopuscards.com/corporate/why/statistics/en/index.jsp Octopus official statistic]</ref> The operator of the Octopus system, [[Octopus Cards Limited]], is a joint venture between [[MTR Corporation]] and other transport providers in Hong Kong namly [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]] (KCRC), [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] (KMB), [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] and [[New World First Bus Services Limited]] (NWFB).  Octopus's international arm, [[Octopus Knowledge Limited]], has won a contract to export Octopus-style systems to the [[Netherlands]].

==Name and logo==
[[Image:M%C3%B6bius_strip.jpg|thumb|A Möbius Strip made out of paper and adhesive tape]]
The [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] name for the Octopus card, ''Baat3 daat6 tung1'' ([[Traditional Chinese character]]s: {{lang|zh-Hant-HK|{{linktext|八|達|通}}}}; [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified]]: {{lang|zh-Hans|八达通}}), literally means “eight-place pass”. It was selected by the head of the [[MTR Corporation]], the parent company of [[Octopus Cards Limited]], in a naming competition held in 1996. Eight is a significant number in Chinese in that it is often used to indicate “many”. For instance, the phrase ''sei3 tung1 baat3 daat6'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|四|通|八|達}}}}), literally meaning “four throughfares, eight reachables”, is a common expression meaning “reachable in all directions”. [[8 (number)#As a lucky or unlucky number|Eight]] is also considered a lucky [[Numbers in Chinese culture#Eight|number in Chinese culture]]. The [[English language|English]] name “Octopus card” is derived from the use of the number eight since an [[octopus]] has eight [[tentacle]]s. The name is also particularly appropriate since “octopus” has the [[connotation]] of being able to grab many things at the same time and this ability is conferred upon its cardholders who can use it in many different transactions.

The logo used on the card features a [[Möbius strip]] twisted into the shape of the number 8 in order to indicate the card's “infinite” possibilities. The [[mathematics|mathematical]] symbol for [[infinity]], “∞”, looks like a sideways “8” and is commonly thought to be derived from the [[Möbius strip]].

==Types of Octopus Cards==
There are a number of different types of Octopus card available for consumer use and used for various purposes, from monetary transactions to access control for office and residential buildings. Generically, Octopus cards are classified as On-Loan cards and Sold cards. On-Loan cards are the cards issued for usage in modern day-to-day life primarily for ticketing in transport systems, while Sold cards are special purpose, sponsored and branded cards. On-Loan cards are further classified into Child, Adult, and Elder categories based on age, and subsequent concessions on fares are accorded to select categories.

===Fare grades===
On-Loan Octopus cards are categorised into different fare categories to account for concessionary fares offered by different public transport companies.

If no elder fares are available, adult fares are deducted. This card is sold for HK$70 with an initial value of HK$20.
|}

===Personalised cards===
[[Image:Octopus-card-person.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Obverse side of a rainbow-coloured Octopus card]]
Apart from the three general types of personalised cards, a special personalised card is also available, where the name and photo, if opted, of the holder are imprinted on the cards. Registration is required for these rainbow-coloured cards. They can function automatically as a Child, Adult or Elder card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for concessionary fares. [[As of 2003|As of May 2003]], there were 380,000 holders of personalised Octopus cards.

Student status can also be applied for by full-time Hong Kong students aged between 12 and 25.  In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card can be used as a key card for access to some residential and office buildings, primarily those built or managed by [[MTR Corporation]]. These cards are largely used by students for access to schools, apartment buildings, and other facilities. 

Personalised cards are automatically issued when a student applies for concessionary privileges, although some non-personalised student cards remain in circulation. According to Octopus Cards Limited, [[City University of Hong Kong]] and more than 50 [[Secondary education in Hong Kong|secondary schools in Hong Kong]] use the Octopus card to record the attendance of students, in lieu of roll calls, and to manage [[library]] books.

This card can be frozen to prevent unauthorized use, should the card be lost.

===Sold Octopus cards===
Special-edition souvenir cards, referred to as Sold Octopus cards, are frequently released by the operator, usually with tie-ins to a movie or a particular event. They are usually sold at a premium, have limited or no initial stored value and cannot be refunded, but can otherwise be used as ordinary cards. As an example of price, the three Octopus cards in the ''[[Hello Kitty]] & Friends'' collection are sold for HK$138 each, have $0 initial stored value, and all three are Adult cards. The three ''Pearl of Nature'' cards are HK$70 each, have $0 initial stored value, but are available in Adult, Child and Elder versions. 

In the past, Octopus has launched special cards for such occasions as the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], the passing of the year 2004, and the release of the movie ''[[DragonBlade: The Legend of Lang|DragonBlade]]''. These limited-edition cards are becoming collectibles, with the rarest, probably an [[Andy Lau]] tour card, being worth many thousands of Hong Kong dollars.

===Special purpose cards===
Besides the On-Loan and Sold type Octopus cards, MTR also introduced special purpose cards  targeting tourists in [[Hong Kong]]. The ''Airport Express Tourist Octopus'' comes in two versions, a HK$220 card with a free [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]] single ride included or a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase. As with other Octopus cards, when using the Airport Express, connecting MTR travel is free.  Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR, and include HK$20 in usable value for non-MTR rides or other uses, and a HK$50 refundable deposit.  More value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong 14 or fewer days; users may be required to produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong. 

Another special Octopus card, called the ''MTR Airport Staff Octopus'', is available for the staff of [[Hong Kong International Airport]] for cheaper commuting between the airport and MTR stations via the Airport Express.

==Octopus card Usage==
[[Image:Octopus_McDonalds_Central.jpg|thumb|250px|Octopus card reader at a [[McDonald's]] [[restaurant]] in [[Central and Western District|Central]].]]
An on-loan Octopus card can be purchased at [[MTR|Mass Transit Railway]] (MTR) and [[KCR|Kowloon Canton Railway]] (KCR) stations. No identification is required. If an owner loses a card, only the stored value of the card is lost. This type of Octopus card is anonymous; no personal information, bank account or credit card details are stored on the card.

Octopus Cards were primarily introduced for ticketing in public transport. However the use of the card expanded for multiple purposes.The card can be used to pay fares or to make purchases for nearly all public [[transportation in Hong Kong|Hong Kong transportation system]]s, including taxis and also   as a means for collecting toll at parking meters. The card can also be used to purchase consumer products at many stores in the city, most notably, [[7-Eleven]], [[McDonald's]], and other [[convenience store]]s, fast food restaurants and [[Starbucks]] coffee shops. A large number of vending machines and self-service kiosks in Hong Kong accept Octopus as payment; these range from beverage vending machines to [[payphones]] and photo-booths. They can be used to purchase travel insurance and self-service photo-copying. [[Ricoh]], [[Minolta]] and [[Fuji Xerox]] offer [[photocopiers]] that support payment by Octopus.

Further, beyond consumer transaction domain, Octopus cards are used for access control in buildings and in some cases to record class attendance for students, in lieu of roll calls. 

===Payment using Octopus Cards===

[[Image:OctopusReaderGate.jpg|thumb|250px|Octopus reader at an [[MTR]] ticket gate.]]
Making or recording a payment using the card while passing through an MTR or ferry ticket gate, boarding a bus, alighting from a [[Hong Kong Tramways|tram]], or while purchasing items from various outlets can be done by holding the card against or in close proximity to an Octopus card reader. The Octopus card reader usually bears a yellow and orange colour scheme or logo similar to the card itself. After a brief moment (about 0.3 seconds per transaction),{{fact}} the reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep sound, and display the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card. A higher pitched sound will be emitted if the card is not accepted, i.e. if the stored value is insufficient (below -HK$35), or if the reader is unable to read the card owing to interference or insufficient time delay. Concession users are acknowledged by a higher pitched beep on all forms of transport except the MTR, which plays three notes in succession. MTR and KCR systems note the entry point of commuters when a card is held close to the reader, and will deduct the appropriate amount when the users show their card again at the exit point.

As Octopus cards do not require physical contact with readers, and can be read from up to a few centimetres away through common materials such as cotton or leather; visitors to Hong Kong may find it strange to see people holding their wallets, handbags, backpacks or jackets on or near readers. And with other Octopus products, you may even see people waving their cellphone, watch or even a keychain over the Octopus reader.

==== Special fares and discount schemes====
The MTR and KCR charge less for journeys made using an Octopus card instead of conventional single-journey tickets. For example, the cost of a single journey from [[Chai Wan (MTR)|Chai Wan]] to [[Tung Chung (MTR)|Tung Chung]] is HK$23.10 with an Octopus card, and HK$26 with a single journey ticket. The KCR also uses the Octopus card to store the status of its One-Month Pass scheme. Passengers who register and purchase the One-Month Pass can use their Octopus cards as access control for unlimited rides on the specified line for a month, and they can travel on KCR trains even if their Octopus cards have insufficient or negative stored value. Other public transport operators also offer discounts (usually 10%) for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round-trip transits.

====Octopus Rewards====
Apart from storing the transaction records and the value remaining, the Octopus cards can also be used to earn various kinds of rewards. In the past, passengers could earn "MTR Points" for their rides on the MTR to redeem collectibles or free single-ride tickets. Now the Octopus Cards Limited has also launched an Octopus Rewards Scheme,<ref>[http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/en/index.jsp Octopus Rewards]</ref> enabling citizens to earn reward points for every purchase in designated shops by a ratio of HK$200 = R$1 (reward point). The Octopus card should be registered beforehand and presented at the time of purchase, but payment can be settled by other means. The points stored in the card can be used to pay for purchases (R$1 = HK$1) or to redeem other products.

===Renewing and adding more value===

[[Image:WuKaiShaStation-TicketMachines.png|thumb|280px|Concourse at the [[Wu Kai Sha (KCR)|Wu Kai Sha railway station]]. <br/><br/> The first machine on the left (one with the orange octopus logo and small screen attached to the wall) is for checking the balance of Octopus cards. The next two are add-value machines, while the remaining four are conventional ticket vending machines.]] Value can be added to the card through a number of ways. ''Add-value machines'' are located at all stations in the MTR and KCR networks which can be used to add more value to the cards. The add-value machines accept cash, as well as facilitate [[Electronic Funds Transfer]]. Alternatively, any [[point of sale]] ([[supermarkets]], [[convenience stores]]) that accepts Octopus cards also serve as a point for adding more value on the cards. MTR and KCR service centres also serve as a point for topping up value in Octopus cards. 

An On-loan Octopus card can store a maximum of [[HK$]]1,000, and has a deposit value of HK$50. The maximum negative value on a card is HK$35. There are a number of features in an Octopus card, especially, the ability to allow cardholders to use a card with an insufficient value to make one last trip even if the balance on the card is only at, say, HK$0.10. The maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]] and first class of the [[KCR East Rail]] is HK$34.8. Once the value in the card goes negative, the card is automatically frozen till more value is added to the card for further use. 

====Automatic Add Value Service====
The Automatic Add Value Service (AAVS) is a transaction service wherein, a bank account is linked to a personalised card or an ordinary card. The owner of an Octopus card can sign up to use a local bank account or [[credit card]] to top up the value on the Octopus automatically. The card is automatically topped up with HK$250 after the balance goes below zero. Each card can be automatically topped up once every 24 hours. [[As of 2006]], 22 local banks including [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|HSBC]] and [[Bank of China (Hong Kong)]] offer this service.<ref>[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/aavs/en/index.jsp Octopus Card AAVS Page] ''accessed'' [[December 11]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Refunding an Octopus card===
Octopus cards are highly popular with tourists and residents alike , which explains how there are twice as many Octopus cards in circulation as there are [[Demographics of Hong Kong|people living in Hong Kong]] (although some people own more than one card). Surveys by the MTR show that this is because the deposit and the remaining value on the card are fully refundable, except for a HK$7 (HK$10 for personalised cards) administrative charge for cards refunded less than 3 months after issue. However, such practice is discouraged.

==Octopus gadgets==
Octopus sells "Octopus watches" - plastic wristwatches with a [[Sony]] [[FeliCa]] IC chip embedded inside, made by a number of suppliers. Users making payments can simply wave their arm over the card reader. These watches can be purchased at MTR service counters and convenience stores when available. 11,482 transponder watches were delivered to Octopus Cards Limited for the year ending [[31 May]] [[2003]], the latest year in which figures are available as of 2005.

[[Nokia]] also produced an Octo-phone, which has the smartcard embedded in the "Xpress-on" covers used in the Nokia 33nn series of [[mobile phone]]s, an example being the popular [[Nokia 3310]] model.

==Back-end technology and operations==
The Octopus system was designed by MTR's own experts and through an open tender, AES ProData (Hong Kong) Limited, now known as [http://www.erggroup.com/default.htm ERG Transit Systems]. ERG, an [[Australia]]n company based in [[Perth, Western Australia]], was selected as the lead supplier.<ref>http://www.erggroup.com/projects/hongkong.htm ERG GROUP - Projects: Hong Kong</ref><ref>http://www.visionengineer.com/tech/octopus.php Octopus Card - Multipurpose Smart Card</ref>

ERG was contracted to build a number of the components, including the back-end systems. Operations, maintenance and development is undertaken by Octopus, and in 2005, Octopus replaced the central transaction clearing house with its own system.

The Octopus card uses the [[Sony]] 13.56 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[FeliCa]] [[RFID|radio frequency identification]] ([[RFID]]) chip (and other related technology); and Hong Kong is the home of the world's first major public transport system using this technology. This is a "touch and go" system, so users need only hold the card in close proximity of the reader, and thus physical contact is not required. Data is transmitted at up to 212 kbit/s (the maximum speed for Sony FeliCa chips), compared with 9.6 kbit/s for [[Mondex]] and [[Visa Cash]].

Octopus uses a nonstandard system for RFID instead of the [[ISO 14443]] standards, since there were no standards in the nascent industry during its development in 1997. The operating range of the reader/writer is between 30 and 100 mm depending on the type of model being used.

===Clearing and settlement===
[[Image:OctopusEnquiryMachine.jpg|thumb|250px|An Octopus enquiry machine, which is used to check transaction details and outstanding balance of an Octopus card.]]
Octopus is specifically designed so that card transactions are relayed for clearing on a [[store and forward]] basis, without any requirement for reader units to have [[realtime]] round-trip communications with a central database or computer. ([[As of 2005]], the database systems are provided by [[Oracle Corporation]]). The stored data about the transaction may be transmitted by network after hours, or in the case of offline mobile readers may be retrieved by a hand held device, for example a [[Pocket PC]].

In practice, different data collection mechanisms are used by different transport operators, depending on the nature of their business. The [[MTR]] equips its stations with [[local area network]]s that connect the various components that deal with Octopus cards - [[turnstile]]s, add-value machines, check value machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's [[Kowloon Bay (MTR)|Kowloon Bay]] headquarters through a [[frame relay]] [[wide area network]] (as of 2005, provided by [[PCCW]]), and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing. Similar arrangements are in place for [[KCR]] stations and for retailers such as [[7-Eleven]]. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.

===Privacy and encryption===
The Octopus card uses [[encryption]] for all airborne communication and it uses two-way [[authentication]] based on [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI). In other words, data communications to and from the card are only established when mutually authenticated security handshaking is verified followed by transfer of encrypted data.

==Operator==
:''Main article: [[Octopus Cards Limited]]''

[[As of 2005]], Octopus Cards Limited (OCL), the operator of Octopus, is a joint-venture between six transit companies, namely [[MTR Corporation]] (57.4%), [[KCR]] (22.1%), [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] (KMB) (12.4%), [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] (5%), [[New World First Bus]] (NWFB) (3.05%) and [[First Ferry]] (0.05%). Since the [[Government of Hong Kong]] owns nearly three-quarters of MTR and 100% of KCR, it is the biggest effective shareholder in the company, although the business is operated on a commercial basis.

OCL has been aggressively expanding the use of Octopus in Hong Kong, and has won a number of contracts extending Octopus-style systems overseas, including the [[Netherlands]] and [[Changsha]] in [[Mainland China]].

OCL also settles accounts between the Octopus system and the operators/merchants. Initially, OCL was restricted to having 15% of Octopus card transactions being non-transport, as it operated as an "exempt card" under Hong Kong's ''Banking Ordinance'', but OCL was later granted a deposit-taking licence by the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] (HKMA), which allowed 50% of its transactions to be unrelated to transport. According to HKMA, [[HK$]]416 million (USD 53.3 million) is deposited in the Octopus system at any given time ([[as of 2000]]).

==History==
[[Image:Octopus reader.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An Octopus reader on [[New World First Bus|NWFB]]]]
The [[MTR]] network adopted a system of recirculated magnetic plastic cards when it started operations in 1979. These cards were either used as single journey tickets or as stored value tickets. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]] (KCRC) adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed [[Common Stored Value Tickets]].

In 1989, the Common Stored Value Tickets system was extended to [[KMB]] buses providing a feeder service to MTR/[[KCR]] stations and to Citybus, and was also extended to a limited number of non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.

[[Mass Transit Railway Corporation]] (MTR) eventually decided to adopt more advanced technologies, and in 1993 announced that it would move towards using contactless smartcards. To gain wider acceptance, MTR and KCRC invited three other major franchised transport operators in Hong Kong, namely KMB, [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] and the [[Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry]] (HYF) to form a joint venture company in 1994, known as Creative Star Limited (renamed Octopus Cards Limited in January 2002). (The only major public transport operator at the time not to join was [[China Motor Bus]], which pulled out of public transport altogether in 1998, in favour of its property development business, and had most of its bus routes transferred to NWFB).

The Octopus system was launched after three years of trials on [[1 September]] [[1997]]. Initially for use on services offered by the five joint venture partners, it was quickly extended to other transport services. In 2000, the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] granted a deposit-taking company license to the operator, removing previous restrictions that prohibited Octopus from generating more than 15% of its turnover from non-transit related functions.

In January 2001, a new shareholders' agreement was signed and the shares of HYF in the operator was transferred to NWFB and New World First Ferry. In conjunction with the privatisation of its parent company, [[MTR Corporation]], Octopus Cards Limited was also transformed from its previous non-profit making status to a profit making enterprise.

On [[29 June]] [[2003]], the Octopus card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18,000 parking meters with a new Octopus card operated system. The replacement was completed on [[21 November]] [[2004]]. A number of government facilities including public swimming pools and sports facilities also adopted the Octopus system at around the same time.

In November 2003, Octopus Cards Limited secured a HK$200 million (USD 25.64 million) contract to help provide contactless smartcard technology in The [[Netherlands]]' system, combining the fare collection system of all its public transport companies - starting with rail operator [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]], bus and tramway operator [[Connexxion]], public transport companies of [[Rotterdam]] (RET) and [[Amsterdam]] (GVB) and the tram system in [[The Hague]] (HTM).

==Adoption of the Octopus card==
The Octopus system was launched in 1997, and 3 million cards were issued within the first three months. The main reason for the quick success of the system was that the MTR and KCR required that all holders of common stored value tickets replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, thus forcing their combined base of 3.3 million commuters (2.2 million for the MTR,<ref>[http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/investrelation/patronage.php Statistic of daily MTR patronage]</ref> 1.1 million for the KCR<ref>[http://www.kcr.com.hk/html/eng/corporate/about_kcrc/corporate_profile/index.asp Statistic of daily KCR patronage]</ref>) to switch quickly. Another reason is the coin shortage in Hong Kong after 1997; there is a belief that old coins in Hong Kong will appreciate in value, so many people stockpiled coins and waited for their value to increase.{{fact}} By November 1998, 4.6 million cards were issued, and this rose to 9 million by January 2002.

The Octopus system was quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners, and KMB reported that by 2000, most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card, with very few coins used. (Boarding a bus in Hong Kong requires giving exact change; this can be cumbersome. For example, the March 2005 standard fare of a cross-[[Victoria Harbour|harbour]] journey was HK$8.90, which required a minimum of six coins.)

One of the key factors resulting in the success of Octopus cards is ubiquity: the card received the full backing of all transport operators in a particular area, facilitating widespread acceptance. This model has been adopted by the [[Suica]] system for [[JR East]] and the [[ICOCA]] system for [[JR West]].

==Comparison with other electronic cash systems==
[[Mondex]] specifically cited the widespread popularity of Octopus as the reason for withdrawing from the Hong Kong market in 2002. This is despite the fact that they launched their cards one year before the Octopus (in 1996), and had the backing of two of Hong Kong's biggest [[bank]]s, [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|HSBC]] and its subsidiary [[Hang Seng Bank]]. Academic studies suggest that the biggest cause was the lack of a compelling reason on the commuters' part to adopt the Mondex system which, unlike Octopus, had the solid backing of public transport companies and hence commuters and other travellers using their service.

Another reason might be that Mondex users had to have an account with the issuing bank, lessening its appeal for people using other banks.

An additional drawback was that Mondex cards required 5 seconds to process, compared with 0.3 second for a "touch and go" Octopus card. 84% of respondents in a [[University of Auckland]] survey attributed the success of Octopus to quick service.

Octopus cards are also anonymous, except for certain specific purposes.<ref>[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/general/global/en/policy.jsp Octopus Card Personal Data Policy]</ref> Lack of [[anonymity]] is one of the reasons cited for the failure of many cash cards, such as [[Visa Cash|VisaCash]], which has the backing of two of Hong Kong's biggest banks, [[Bank of China (Hong Kong)|Bank of China]] and [[Standard Chartered Bank]].

==Comparison with other transit card systems==
Mass transit agencies have been using stored value, pre-paid cards for electronic ticketing since the 1970s. This market started to move from magnetic stripe technology to smart cards since the early 1990s; Hong Kong was actually the first major system to change over.

The Sony FeliCa technology used by Octopus is also used by [[Singapore]]'s [[EZ-link]] card for its [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus]] systems, [[Japan]]'s [[Suica]] on the [[JR East]], as well as the [[Nagasaki Smart Card]] system in [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. All these however use more up-to-date versions of the technology, compared with the older Octopus system. [[EasyCard]] from [[Taipei]]'s [[Taipei Rapid Transit System|TRTS]] is explicitly modelled after Octopus cards, and Octopus Cards Limited worked on the development of [[Shenzhen Metro]]'s [[Shenzhen TransCard]]. A number of other transport related smart card systems have used Octopus cards as a model in their development, including the [[Oyster Card]] for [[Transport for London|transport in London]].

[[Seoul]] also uses the [[T-Money]] system, which is used in the same way as the Octopus card. The [[T-Money]] system can be used on all [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] lines, and can also be used to transfer into the bus system in Seoul. Other such cards exist, which enables its owner to use it widely across Korea, including most of the bus systems in the [[Gyeonggi-do]] province.

==Future developments==
*On 27 June 2006, after 10 years of negotiations between Octopus card company and the taxi industry, the first trial of taxis equipped with Octopus card readers was launched in the New Territories with the Yellow Taxi Group and widely welcomed by the public and the local press. 

::On 30 October 2006, the South China Morning Post reported that eight of the 20 taxis participating in the trial had dropped out. Part of the reason was technical &mdash; drivers must return to the office every day for accounting. The Octopus card company said it would be upgrading the system to allow automatic account updating in the future. 

::Wong Yu-ting, managing director of the Yellow Taxi Group, also noted that "We have been trying to convince restaurants and retailers to offer discounts to Octopus taxi passengers, but the Transport Department has been a major obstacle." The Transport Department is against this approach for legal reasons. By law, taxi drivers may not solicit customers by offering fare discounts and the department sees little difference between retail and cash discounts. 

::Not mentioned in the article was the fact that there is no Octopus mechanism to add tips to fares, possibly reducing a taxi driver's income as tips would have to be given separately, in change or bills. 

*[[MTR]] has signed an agreement with the developer of the Shenzhen Metro's automatic fare collection system towards making Octopus cards compatible with the fare collection system in [[Shenzhen Metro]], which would require that the systems automatically convert fares denominated in [[Renminbi]] into Hong Kong dollars.
