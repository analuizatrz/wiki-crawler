The '''Docklands Light Railway''' ('''DLR''') is a [[light rail]] system serving the redeveloped [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area of east [[London]], [[England]]. It extends to [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] to the north, [[Greenwich]] and [[Lewisham]] to the south, west close to London city centre and east to the rest of the Docklands, [[London City Airport]] and eventually [[Woolwich]] (currently [[North Woolwich]]). The DLR has separate tracks and [[rolling stock]] from the [[London Underground]], but the two systems share a ticketing system and the DLR appears on the London Underground’s [[Tube map]]. 

All the trains are computer-controlled and have no driver: a passenger service agent (PSA) on each train is responsible for patrolling the train, checking tickets, making announcements, and controlling the doors. PSAs can also take control of the train in case of computer failure or emergency. Overground stations are unstaffed and underground stations staffed, with a few exceptions.

Operation and maintenance of the DLR has been carried out by a private franchise since 1997. The current franchise, due to expire in April 2013, belongs to Serco Docklands Ltd, a company jointly formed by [[Serco]] and the former DLR management team. 

The DLR system is undergoing constant expansion, with 38 stations currently on the system.

==History==
[[image:DLR tower gateway.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tower Gateway station was the DLR’s original link to central London.]]

=== Initial system ===
The DLR was conceived in the early 1980s ''[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/dlr/about/beginning.shtml]'' by the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] (LDDC) to aid the regeneration of the docks of East London, which had been derelict since the 1960s.  LDDC had powers to secure land in the now derelict docks for regeneration, which it did through compulsory purchase where necessary. As originally conceived, the system was to be entirely above ground and consist of three branches, with their termini at [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]], [[Stratford station|Stratford]], and [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]]. The early plan was an [[London Underground|underground]] line with connections from [[Charing Cross]] to [[Woolwich Arsenal]] via [[Fenchurch Street]], [[Surrey Docks]], [[Isle of Dogs]], [[North Greenwich]] and [[Custom House]]. However things changed when the Conservative Government took office on [[4 May]] [[1979]]. They ordered the study into feasible [[light rail]] options, resulting in the birth of the DLR. 

The initial idea was to use modern [[tram]]-derived light rail vehicles, with overhead current collection, manual driving, and some street running. The LDDC, however, wanted to showcase cutting-edge technology and disliked overhead wires, and so chose an automatically-driven system with [[third rail|third-rail]] current collection, but still using tram-derived vehicles. Most of the track was elevated, either on new lightweight concrete viaducts or on disused railway viaducts, with some use of disused surface-level railway right of way. The system was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on [[31 July]] [[1987]], with passenger service starting a month later, on [[31 August]].

The system was lightweight, with stations and trains only a single articulated vehicle long. The three branches together totalled 13 [[Kilometre|km]],<ref name="facts">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/dlr/about/facts.shtml Facts]'', with 13 stations. Retrieved [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref> were connected by a flat triangular junction near Poplar. Services ran Tower Gateway-Island Gardens and Stratford-Island Gardens, meaning that the north side of the junction was not used in regular passenger service.

===First extensions===
[[Image:Tower Gateway DLR station 3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The view from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] looking east shows [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] approach tracks to the left, the original DLR line in the centre, and DLR train emerging from the tunnel to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] to the right]]

The initial system proved to have insufficient capacity as the Docklands area developed into a major financial centre and employment zone. Additionally, the Tower Gateway terminus, situated at the very edge of the [[City of London]], attracted criticism for its poor connections.

In response to this, all stations and trains were extended to two-unit lengths, and the system was extended into the heart of the City of London with a tunnel to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank underground station]], which opened in 1991. This extension diverged from the initial western branch, leaving [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]] on a limb. It also rendered the initial car fleet obsolete, as its construction was not suitable for use underground ''(see Rolling Stock, below)''.

At the same time, the areas in the east of [[London Docklands|Docklands]] needed better transport connections to encourage development. This resulted in a fourth branch being constructed, from [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] via [[Canning Town station|Canning Town transport interchange]] to [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]], running along the north side of the [[Royal Docks]] complex. As part of this extension, one side of the original flat triangular junction was replaced with a [[grade separation|grade-separated]] junction west of Poplar, and a new grade-separated junction was created at the divergence of the Stratford and Beckton lines east of Poplar. Poplar station was rebuilt to provide cross-platform interchange between the Stratford and Beckton lines.

The growth of the [[Canary Wharf]] office complex required the redevelopment of [[Canary Wharf DLR station]] from a small wayside station to a large complex with six platforms serving three tracks, beneath a large overall roof and fully integrated into the malls below the office towers. The original DLR station was never completed.

Once Canary Wharf became a major financial employment centre, demands came to improve transport connections with residential areas in south-east London. This was met by an extension of the DLR from [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]] in tunnel under the [[River Thames]] to [[Greenwich station|Greenwich]] and then on a new elevated route paralleling [[River Ravensbourne|Deptford Creek]] to an interchange at the major rail junction of [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]]. Besides providing two new rail interchanges at Greenwich and Lewisham, this branch also serves the tourist area of Greenwich, with a new station at [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark]].

On [[2 December]] [[2005]], a new eastward branch - running along the southern side of the [[Royal Docks]] complex - opened from Canning Town to [[King George V DLR station|King George V]], via [[London City Airport]].

==Current system== 
[[image:dlr.canary.wharf.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Docklands Light Railway train enters [[Canary Wharf]] from the south.]]

The DLR now includes 31 [[Kilometre|km]] of track.<ref name="facts">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/dlr/about/facts.shtml Facts]''. Retrieved [[February 26]], [[2006]].</ref> There are five branches: to [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]] in the south, [[Stratford station|Stratford]] in the north, [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]] and [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] in the east, and to Central London, splitting to serve [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]]. Although the system allows many different combinations of routings, at present the following four routes are operated in normal service:

* Bank to Lewisham
* Tower Gateway to Beckton
* Stratford to Lewisham
* Bank to King George V

Some trains on the Stratford line turn back at [[Crossharbour and London Arena DLR station|Crossharbour and London Arena]] rather than continuing to Lewisham. There are also occasional trains from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] to [[Crossharbour and London Arena DLR station|Crossharbour]] and [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]]. There are no [[limited-stop]] trains on the DLR - each train serves every stop along its route.

The northern and southern branches terminate at the National Rail (main line) stations at Stratford and Lewisham respectively. Other direct interchanges between the DLR and National Rail are at Limehouse and Greenwich.

===Stations===

[[image:DLR_Westferry_aerial_view.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An eastbound train leaving Westferry Station.]]
Many DLR stations are elevated, with a few at street level, in a cutting, or underground. Access to the platforms is normally by staircase, with very few stations having escalators. Since 2000, all DLR stations have had lifts or ramps, making them accessible by [[wheelchair]]. The stations have high platforms, matching the floor height of the cars, allowing easy access to the trains for passengers with wheelchairs or pushchairs.

Most of the stations conform to a modular design dating back to the initial system, albeit extended. This design has two side platforms, each with separate access from the street, and platform canopies with a distinctive rounded roof design. Almost all stations are unstaffed, although for legislative reasons the three underground stations, [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]], and [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark]], are staffed, along with a few of the busier interchange stations.

See [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations]] for stations on the system.

===Fares and ticketing===
Ticketing for single and return journeys is part of the London Underground fare zone system, and [[Travelcard]]s that cover the correct zones are valid. 

There are also one-day and season DLR-only ‘Rover’ tickets available, plus a one-day DLR ‘Rail and River Rover’ ticket for use on the DLR and on City Cruises river boats. Oyster Pre-Pay is also available on the DLR — passengers need to both touch in and touch out their [[Oyster card]]s on the readers at the entrance / exit to the platforms, or pass through the automatic gates at selected stations.

Tickets must be purchased from ticket machines at the entrance to the platforms, and are required before the passenger enters the platform. There are no ticket barriers in DLR-only stations, and correct ticketing is enforced by on-train checks by the Passenger Service Agent. Exceptions to this rule are [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]], and [[Stratford station|Stratford]] stations, where the DLR platforms are located within the barrier lines of a [[London Underground]] or [[National Rail]] station.

The DLR is used by up to a hundred thousand people daily, with around 60 million journeys yearly.

==Rolling stock==
[[Image:Dlr_emu_at_tower_gateway.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A DLR train is headed by B2K stock car 96, shown at [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]]]]

''Main Article: [[Docklands Light Railway rolling stock]]''

The DLR is operated by high-floor, bi-directional, single-articulated cars with four doors on each side, with each train composed of two cars. The cars have no driver’s cab, although there is a small driver’s console concealed behind a locked panel at each car end from which the PSA can drive the car in an emergency. Other consoles at each door opening allow the PSA to control door closure and make announcements whilst patrolling the train. Because of the absence of a driver’s position, the fully-glazed car ends provide an excellent forward (or rear) view for passengers. The current stock has a top speed of 50mph (80km/hour).

Despite having high floors and being highly automated, the cars are derived from a [[Germany|German]] [[light rail|light-rail]] design intended for use in systems with elements of street running. All the cars that have operated on the system to date look similar, but there have been several different types, some still in service and others sold to other operators. A further car type, with quite different styling, is to be introduced in 2007.

==Signalling technology==

Originally, the DLR used signalling based on a fixed block technology developed by GEC-General Signal and [[General Railway Signal]]<ref>Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook, Stephen Jolly and Bob Bayman (1987)</ref>. This was replaced in 1994 with a moving-block system developed by [[Alcatel]], called [[SelTrac]]. The same technology is used for some other [[rapid transit]] systems, including Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], San Francisco's Municipal Railway ([[MUNI]]), and [[Hong Kong]]'s MTR. Transmissions occur between each train's onboard computer and the control centre at Poplar. If this link is broken, the train stops until it is authorised to move again. If the whole system fails the train will run at only 20km/h for safety until the system is restored. Also, emergency brakes can be applied if the train breaks the speed limit during manual control, or if the train leaves the station when the route has not been set.<ref> Railway Technology (2006) [http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/ Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Extensions, London, United Kingdom] Retrieved [[23 November]] [[2006]] </ref>

==Future developments==
With the development of the eastern Docklands as part of the ‘[[Thames Gateway]]’ initiative and London’s successful bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], several extensions and enhancements are under construction, being planned or being discussed:<ref name="dlrdev">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/index.asp DLR Development Projects]'' Retrieved [[February 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

===New platforms at Stratford===
'''''Status''' - Under Construction''

The DLR has only one platform at [[Stratford station|Stratford]], which limits capacity and ease of interchange with other platforms. Two replacement platforms are under construction. The first was expected to open in January 2007 with the decommissioning of the old platform at this time. This is now expected to happen in April (this part of the railway is closed over Easter for engineering works).  The second platform is now due to open in August 2007.

===Woolwich Arsenal Extension===
'''''Status''' - Under Construction''

An extension of the [[London City Airport]] branch from [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] to [[Woolwich Arsenal railway station|Woolwich Arsenal]] is under construction. This requires a second DLR tunnel crossing of the [[River Thames]]. The projected cost of £150 million is expected to be met through a [[Private Finance Initiative]]. Construction began in June 2005, with the boring machine being entered in June 2006, and is due to be completed in February 2009.<ref name="dlrwae">Docklands Light Railway (2006). ''[http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/latest_news/details.asp?id=108  Mayor launches tunnelling of DLR Woolwich Arsenal Extension]'' Retrieved [[April 28]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Langdon Park station===
'''''Status''' - Under Construction''<ref> [http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/langdonpark/details.asp?id=29 Construction begins]</ref>

A planning application for a station at [[Langdon Park DLR station|Langdon Park]] between [[All Saints DLR station|All Saints]] and [[Devons Road DLR station|Devons Road]] has been approved. A contractor has been chosen and [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/press-releases/press-releases-content.asp?prID=938 construction started] on [[17 November]] [[2006]], with the station being due to open in late 2007. During construction, trains may be suspended between Poplar and Stratford, or may terminate at All Saints.<ref name="lpdsplan">Docklands Light Railway. ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/langdonpark/what_next.shtml Langdon Park development information]''.</ref>

===Upgrading Bank - Lewisham route to 3-car trains===
'''''Status''' - Transport & Works Act and financial approval given''

There is formal approval to upgrade the lines between [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank station]] and [[Lewisham station]] to allow operation of 3-car trains and increase capacity. More frequent trains were considered as an alternative, but it was found that the necessary signalling changes would be as expensive as upgrading to longer trains, and provide fewer benefits.<ref name="dlrcapen">Docklands Light Railway.(2005). ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/dlr_capacity/index.shtml DLR Capacity Enhancement]''. Retrieved [[February 26]], [[2006]].</ref> 

It is expected that the work will be carried out during 2007-2009. The work involves the lengthening of platforms on most stations (except [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]]), together with viaduct-strengthening works to support the longer trains. Most of this section dates from the initial system originally built for single-car operation. [[South Quay DLR station|South Quay station]] will require relocating as nearby curves preclude lengthening. The underground [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark station]] will not be extended due to the cost and the risk to nearby historic buildings.  Instead, use of [[Selective Door Operation]] (SDO) has been approved by the [[Railway Inspectorate]] at this station.

====Other stations affected====
Although not on the Bank - Lewisham route, two other stations are included in the plans in order to improve operational flexibility. [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar station]] has already been lengthened in advance of the work being done at other stations in order to confirm that the proposed method of construction is satisfactory before committing to it elsewhere. [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] is due to be converted from its current two-track terminal layout into a single longer platform. However the exact details of the Tower Gateway work are under review.<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref>

===Stratford International Extension / North London Line conversion===
'''''Status''' - First of Three Contracts Let <ref> [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/press-releases/press-releases-content.asp?prID=1038 Major contract award signals start of work on DLR Stratford International Extension]</ref>''

On [[October 25]] [[2006]], permission was granted<ref name="siedlr">Docklands Light Railway. ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/extensions/stratford/details.asp?id=28 'Stratford International extension approved' article]''. Retrieved [[October 25]] [[2006]].</ref> for this extension from Canning Town to the new [[Stratford International station]], taking over the [[North London Line]] infrastructure (which closed on [[December 9]] [[2006]]) and linking the Docklands area with domestic and international high-speed services on the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]].

Four new stations will be built: [[Star Lane DLR station|Star Lane]] (formerly known as Cody Road), [[Abbey Road DLR station|Abbey Road]], [[Stratford High Street DLR station|Stratford High Street]] (formerly known as Stratford Market), and Stratford International. The branch will also serve [[London Underground]] and [[National Rail]] stations at [[West Ham]] and [[Stratford, London|Stratford]].  All stations will be capable of accommodating three-unit trains. The North London Line will terminate at Stratford in new platforms.

As part of the [[Transport and Works Act 1992|Transport & Works Act]] (TWA) application, the DLR station at Royal Victoria on the Beckton branch will be extended to accommodate three-unit trains.  Additionally, it will have a third platform, which becomes possible because the part of the abandoned section of [[North London Line]] ran parallel to Royal Victoria station.<ref name="rvdsplan">Docklands Light Railway. ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/twa_documents/planningdirection/037.pdf Map showing proposed Royal Victoria station]''. Retrieved [[February 26]], [[2006]].</ref>

The first contract for construction work was awarded on the 10th January 2007<ref> [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/press-releases/press-releases-content.asp?prID=1038 Major contract award signals start of work on DLR Stratford International Extension]</ref> and construction work is expected to start in mid 2007. The extension is projected to open early in 2010 and is an important part of the transport improvement package for the [[2012 Olympic Games]], which will largely be held on a site adjoining Stratford International.

===Upgrading other lines to 3-car trains===
'''''Status''' - Transport & Works Act approved

Once the work to allow 3-car trains between [[Bank station|Bank]] and [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]] has been completed, the only parts of the network unable to accommodate longer trains will be between [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]], and between Poplar and [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]]. There is therefore a proposal to upgrade the remainder of the line, with the aim of carrying out the work between 2008 and 2010. 

As part of this work, it is proposed to enhance the junction north of [[West India Quays DLR station|West India Quay]], which would preclude services on the Bank to Lewisham route from stopping at West India Quay. This would also allow services from [[Beckton]] and [[Woolwich]] to terminate at [[Canary Wharf]] or [[Lewisham]].

===Barking Riverside extension===
'''''Status''' - In consultation phase, route safeguarded'' - [[2016]]

This is a proposed extension from Gallions Reach to Dagenham Dock via the riverside at Barking. This would connect the Barking Reach area, a formerly industrial area now undergoing major redevelopment as part of the [[London Riverside]], with the Docklands. This new route would cover major developments at Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Dock Opportunity Area, and five stations have been planned at Beckton Riverside, Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Vale and [[Dagenham Dock railway station|Dagenham Dock]]. The extension is key if [[English Partnerships]]' plan is to work. 

In the consultation document the proposed timetable suggests work commencing in 2011 and an opening date of 2016. Mayor Ken Livingstone is keen to have the extension open before the [[2012 Olympic Games]]. However, the consultation on the route has only just begun <ref>DLR Barking Riverside consultation document [http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/extensions/dagenham_consultation_leaflet2.pdf]</ref> and as the demand for construction work leading up to the games will be considerable, it is unlikely that major work will begin on this until the games have finished.

===Thames Wharf station===
'''''Status''' - Proposed''

This station had been included as potential future development on the '''London City Airport extension''' since it was first planned. It would be between [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] and [[West Silvertown DLR station|West Silvertown]], due west of the western end of [[Royal Victoria Dock]]. Since the station's intended purpose is to serve the surrounding area (currently a mix of [[brownfield]] and run-down industrial sites) when it is regenerated, the development is indefinitely on hold due to the area being safeguarded for the [[Silvertown Link]], a new Thames river crossing proposed for opening by 2015.<ref name="atoproj41">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2005). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/41 Silvertown Link]'' Retrieved [[February 24]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Connaught Road/Silvertown Interchange station===
'''''Status''' - Proposed''

A site near to [[London City Airport]] has been identified as a possible additional station on the London City Airport extension. It would be a possible interchange with [[Crossrail]], between [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]] and [[Pontoon Dock DLR station|Pontoon Dock]]. However, no plans have emerged as to when this station is to be planned and built. The original extension was designed to allow a station to be built here. It may be located south of the Connaught Crossing.<ref name="atoproj9">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2006). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/9 DLR to City Airport]''. Retrieved [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Charing Cross extension===
'''''Status''' - Proposed'' - [[2006]]

In February [[2006]] a proposal to extend the DLR to [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross station]] (running from either the [[Bank tube station|Bank]] or [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] DLR branches) was revealed.<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref> The idea, originating from a DLR "Horizon Study", is in very early stages at the moment, but would involve extending the line from Bank in bored tunnels under Central London to the Charing Cross [[Jubilee line]] platforms, which would be brought back to public use.  These platforms are on a spur that branches off the current Jubilee line and are not used by passenger trains.

While not confirmed it is probable that the scheme would also use the existing overrun tunnels between the Charing Cross Jubilee platforms and a location slightly to the west of [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych]]. These tunnels were intended to be incorporated into the abandoned Phase 2 of the ''Fleet Line'' (Phase 1 became the original Jubilee Line, prior to the Jubilee Line Extension). However they would need some enlargement because DLR gauge is larger than tube gauge and modern safety regulations would almost certainly require a walkway to be provided in the tunnel.

The two reasons driving the proposal are capacity problems at Bank, having basically one interchange between the DLR and the central portion of [[London Underground|Underground]], and the difficult journeys faced by passengers from [[Kent]] and South Coast between their rail termini and the DLR. Stations would possibly be at [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Pauls]], with subway connections towards the [[Millennium Bridge]], [[City Thameslink]], and [[Aldwych]], for future connection with the [[Cross River Tram]] and [[Charing Cross]].

===Works contingent on Crossrail===
'''''Status''' - Proposed''

If [[Crossrail]] is approved some of the track between Bow Church and Stratford would need to be moved to the south.  The opportunity would then be taken to double the track throughout and eliminate the only significant section of single track on the system.<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref>

The current route projections for the cross-London [[Crossrail]] Line 1 entail interchanges with the DLR at Custom House, Stratford, and the provision for interchanges at West India Quay (with Crossrail Isle of Dogs station) and London City Airport (with Crossrail Silvertown station). Another option would be to provide an interchange with a possible new station on the DLR (see ''Connaught Road/Silvertown Interchange station'' section above).<ref name="atoproj1">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2006). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/1#Benchmark Crossrail]''. Retrieved [[February 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Lewisham to Catford extension===
'''''Status''' - Proposed'' - [[2026]]

This extension was looked at during the latest Horizon Study. The route would follow the [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] line and terminate between [[Catford railway station|Catford station]] and [[Catford Bridge railway station|Catford Bridge station]]. However early plans showed problems due to Lewisham DLR station being only marginally higher than the busy A20 road which impedes any proposed extension. The plan is however being revised.<ref>Always Touch Out [http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/129 DLR to Catford]</ref>
