'''Nauru''' ({{pronounced|næˈuː.ɹuː}}), officially the '''Republic of Nauru''', is an [[island nation]] in the [[Micronesia]]n [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. The nearest neighbour is [[Banaba Island]] in the [[Kiribati|Republic of Kiribati]], 300 km due east. Nauru is the world's smallest island nation, covering just 21&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]] (8.1&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]), the smallest independent [[republic]], and the only republican state in the world without an official [[capital]].<ref name="CIA">[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/nr.html CIA World Fact Book] URL accessed 2006-05-02.</ref> 

Initially inhabited by [[Micronesia]]n and [[Polynesia]]n peoples, Nauru was [[annex]]ed and designated a '[[colony]]' by [[German Empire|Germany]] in the late 19th century, and became a [[League of Nations|mandate territory]] administered by [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]] following [[World War I]]. The [[island]] was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]], and after the war entered into trusteeship again. Nauru achieved independence in [[1968]].

Nauru is a [[phosphate]] rock [[island]], and its primary economic activity since 1907 has been the export of phosphate mined from the island. <ref name="UN">[http://www.un.int/nauru/overview.html Republic of Nauru Permanent Mission to the United Nations] URL Accessed 2006-05-10</ref></small> With the exhaustion of phosphate reserves, its environment severely degraded by mining, and the trust established to manage the island's wealth significantly reduced in value, the government of Nauru has resorted to unusual measures to obtain income. In the [[1990s]], Nauru briefly became a [[tax haven]] and [[money laundering]] center. Since 2001, it has accepted aid from the Australian government; in exchange for this aid, Nauru houses an 'offshore' [[Nauru detention centre|detention centre]] that holds and processes [[right of asylum|asylum seekers]] trying to enter [[Australia]].  

== History ==
[[Image:Nauru_Annexation_Germany_1888.jpg|thumb|left|Nauru annexed in 1888 by Germany.]]
{{main|History of Nauru}}
Nauru was first settled by Micronesian and Polynesian peoples at least 3,000 years ago.<ref name="UNCCD">Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment. 2003. [http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref> There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the 12-pointed star in the nation's [[flag of Nauru|flag]]. The [[Nauruan people]] called their island "Naoero"; the word "Nauru" was later created from "Naoero" so that [[English language|English]] speakers could easily pronounce the name. Nauruans traced their descent on the female side. Naurans subsisted on [[coconut]] and [[Pandanus tectorius|pandanus fruit]], and caught juvenile [[Milkfish|''ibija'' fish]], [[Acclimatization|acclimated]] them to fresh water conditions and raised them in [[Buada Lagoon]], providing an additional reliable source of food.<ref>McDaniel, C. N. and Gowdy, J. M. 2000. ''Paradise for Sale''. University of California Press ISBN 0-520-22229-6 pp 13-28</ref> Traditionally, only men were permitted to fish on the reef, and did so from canoes or by using trained [[Great Frigatebird|man-of-war hawks]]. 

British Captain [[John Fearn]], a whale hunter, became the first Westerner to visit the island in 1798, and named it Pleasant Island. From around the 1830s, Nauruans had contact with Europeans from whaling ships and traders who replenished their supplies at the island. Around this time, beachcombers and deserters began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic [[Palm wine|toddy]] and firearms; the firearms were used during the 10-year [[Nauruan Tribal War|war]] which began in 1878 and resulted in a reduction of the population from 1400 to 900 persons. The island was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's [[Marshall Islands]] Protectorate; they called the island Nawodo or Onawero. The arrival of the Germans ended the war; social changes brought about by the war established Kings as rulers of the island, the most widely known being King [[Auweyida]]. Christian missionaries from the [[Gilbert Islands]] also arrived at the island in 1888.<ref>Ellis, A. F. 1935. ''Ocean Island and Nauru - their story''. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 29-39</ref>

Phosphate was discovered on the island in 1900 by prospector [[Albert Fuller Ellis|Albert Ellis]] and the Pacific Phosphate Company started to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany; they exported their first shipment in 1907.<ref>Ellis, A. F. 1935. ''Ocean Island and Nauru - their story''. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 127-139</ref> Following the outbreak of World War I, the island was captured by Australian forces in 1914. After the war, the [[League of Nations]] gave the UK a trustee mandate over the territory, which it agreed to share with Australian and New Zealand in 1923.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1923/11.html Agreement between Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom] regarding Nauru]</ref> The three governments signed a Nauru Island Agreement in 1919, creating a board known as the [[British Phosphate Commission]] (BPC), which took over the rights to phosphate mining.

Nauru became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, became independent in 1968, led by founding president [[Hammer DeRoburt]]. In 1967, the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned [[Nauru Phosphate Corporation]]. Income from the exploitation of phosphate gave Nauruans one of the highest living standards in the Pacific.

In 1989 the country took legal action against Australia in the [[International Court of Justice]] over Australia's actions during its administration of Nauru, in particular, Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining.<ref>Highet, K and Kahale, H. 1993. Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru. ''The American Journal of International Law'' 87:282-288</ref> The action led to a sizeable out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru. Diminishing phosphate reserves has led to economic decline in Nauru, which has brought increasing political instability since the mid-1980s.

In recent times, a significant proportion of the country's income has come in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the ''[[MV Tampa]]'', a ship which had rescued 433[http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=130456] refugees (from various countries including [[Afghanistan]]) from a stranded 20-metre (65&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) boat and was seeking to dock in Australia, was diverted to Nauru as part of the [[Pacific Solution]].

== Politics ==
{{morepolitics|country=Nauru}}                                    
Nauru is a [[republic]] with a [[parliamentary system]] of government. The president is both the [[head of state]] and of [[head of government|government]]. An 18-member [[unicameral]] parliament is elected every three years. The parliament elects a president from its members, who appoints a cabinet of five to six members. Nauru does not have a formal structure for political parties; candidates typically stand as independents. 15 of the 18 members of the current parliament are independents, and alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties.<ref name="DFAT">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. [http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/nauru/nauru_brief.html Republic of Nauru Country Brief - November 2005] URL accessed on 2006-05-02.</ref> Three parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the [[Democratic Party of Nauru|Democratic Party]], [[Nauru First]] and the [[Centre Party (Nauru)|Centre Party]]. 

Since 1992, local government has been the responsibility of the Nauru Island Council (NIC). The NIC has limited powers and functions as an advisor to the national government on local matters. The role of the NIC is to concentrate its efforts on local activities relevant to Nauruans. An elected member of the Nauru Island Council cannot simultaneously be a member of parliament. <ref>Ogden, M.R.

Nauru has a complex legal system. The Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on [[Constitution of Nauru|constitutional issues]]. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the [[High Court of Australia]];<ref>''Nauru (High Court Appeals)'' Act (Australia) 1976.

Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. Finally, there also are two quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice. <ref name="State Department">[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/16447.htm State Department Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs September 2005] URL Accessed 2006-05-11</ref></small>

Nauru has no armed forces; under an informal agreement, defence is the responsibility of Australia. There is a small police force under civilian control.<ref name="CIA">[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/nr.html CIA World Fact Book] URL Accessed 2006-05-02</ref></small>

==Government Functions==

The island of present-day Nauru was named Pleasant Island by its first European visitors. Today, Nauru is the world's smallest republic.

Nauru's parliament is based on the Westminster model. The principal locus of governmental authority in Nauru is a unicameral parliament with 18 members elected by universal, compulsory suffrage every three years. There are eight district constituencies with the number of representatives for each based on population. The parliament elects the president, a speaker and a deputy speaker.

The president chooses a cabinet from members of parliament. Executive authority is vested in these officials, but they are responsible to the parliament and may be removed by a vote of no confidence. This has, in fact, happened recurrently during Nauru's history since independence.

==Political Conditions==

Nauru's economic viability has rested upon phosphate reserves. Phosphates -- in actuality a resource derived from a 1,000-year cycle of bird droppings -- have been mined on the island since 1906. In the last century, the small Pacific island country has generated healthy revenues from this lucrative -- but finite -- resource.
 
The phosphate supply is reaching levels of extinction in recent years and as such, the future of the people of Nauru is uncertain, and the challenge for the country's policy makers will be to determine a path of continued economic prosperity, without the benefits of this resource.
 
In this regard, the government has tried to develop the island into an offshore financial center, imitating the success of the Bahamas and other island nations around the world that have emerged as major offshore banking centers. The government has invested in property on other islands and is attempting to develop offshore banking services.
 
Over the course of recent years, however, offshore banking institutions and instruments have come under increasing scrunity by international bodies seeking to make international finance a more transparent system. Nauru, as a result, has been a casualty of this movement.
 
In December 1999, four major United States banks banned dollar transactions with four Pacific island states, including Nauru. The United States Department of State issued a report identifying Nauru as a major money laundering center, used by narcotics traffickers and Russian organized crime figures.
 
Offshore banking aside, the last few years have seen repeated changes of government. Nauru's unsettled political situation never led to civil disturbances; the transitions were always sanctioned by parliament and occurred peacefully.
 
President Bernard Dowiyogo took office in April 2000 for his fourth and, after a minimal hiatus, fifth stints as Nauru's top executive. Dowiyogo first served as president from 1976 to 1978. He returned to that office in 1989, and was re-elected in 1992. A vote in parliament, however, forced him to yield power to Kinza Clodumar in 1995. Dowiyogo regained the presidency when the Clodumar government fell in mid-1998.
 
In April 2000, Rene Harris, former chairman of the Nauru Phosphate Corporation, became president as he briefly assembled support in parliament. Harris' attempt to put together an administration lasted for only a few days of parliamentary maneuvering. In the end, Harris proved unable to secure parliament's confidence, and Dowiyogo returned yet again to the presidency by the end of the month.
 
Rene Harris was finally able to claim power as the president of Nauru in March 2001 when he was elected to the presidency by the parliament; his term was to last three years, presumably ending in 2004.
 
The issue of the phosphate supply will likely be one of the most important considerations for the government in the next few years as the supply is forecast to be exhausted by 2003. Since Nauru imports almost everything it consumes -- including food, water and fuel -- the need to diversify the economy and to generate other sources of revenue is of paramount importance.
 
As noted above, offshore banking has been one arena into which Nauru has traversed, however, the rewards are limited by growing concern about the ethical parameters of this business. Tourism is another industry that is also being gradually built.
 
Yet another concern is the ecological damage that has been created on the island as a consequence of phosphate mining over the course of the last century. Along with the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand were responsible for the large scale and indiscriminate mining of phosphate on the tiny island for most of the 20th century.
 
The mining left an ecological and economic disaster for Nauru to handle when the country achieved independence in 1968. Not only was the country's principal resource and employment generating activity almost entirely depleted by the rapid mining done by the three countries, the mining companies had also failed to follow the basic principles of restoring and regenerating the lands where mining had been completed. Thus, Nauru was left to handle the immense and expensive task of restoring large chunks of land which were destroyed by the mining.
 
Nauru demanded compensation from the three nations, but was refused. Finally, in 1993, Nauru was forced to turn to the International Court of Justice at The Hague in The Netherlands. It filed a claim of $73 million against the three countries. The case was soon afterwards settled out of court by Australia, with Britain and New Zealand also contributing to the reparations sought by Nauru.
 
Today, Nauru is almost totally dependent on trade with New Zealand, Australia and Fiji. Arable land is very limited as are all other natural resources, now that its long-time economic base of phosphate mines has been almost completely depleted.
 
On the international front, in late July 2002, Taiwan cut its diplomatic ties with Nauru. Taiwan and Nauru had shared diplomatic ties for 22 years; Taiwan has enjoyed diplomatic ties with several Pacific countries even in the face of the "One China" policy by Beijing. Nevertheless, this particular 22-year long legacy was broken when Nauru's president decided to change its allegiance and establish formal relations with China. The move effectively shifted diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, thus angering the government of Taiwan, which described the shift in policy as "reckless."
 
Nauru's decision to recognize Beijing via the signing of diplomatic papers and a joint commuique ultimately resulted in the cessation of Taiwanese aid. Nauru instead received a US$150 million aid package from Beijing.
 
In early 2003, a fight for power emerged between President Rene Harris and former President Bernard Dowiyogo. The power struggle occurred following a non-confidence vote in parliament, which effectively ejected Harris from the position of president. Reports suggested that Harris was ousted because of rising anxieties regarding economic mismanagement. At the time, Dowiyogo referred to Nauru's political scenario as being "critical."
 
It was reported that Dowiyogo became the president replacing Harris, however, information surrounding the shift in power was sparse. There was very little international coverage of the matter. Regardless, Dowiyogo's tenure did not last for long. In March 2003, Dowiyogo had heart surgery in the United States and died.
 
In May 2003, elections were held within the parliament to select a new president. In those elections, Ludwig Scotty gained the most support and became the new president. The actual results of the parliamentary vote were as follows: Ludwig Scotty -- 10 parliamentary votes, Kinza Clodumar -- 7 parliamentary votes. President Scotty became president on May 29, 2003.  He served only until August 2003 when he was ousted in a non-confidence measure.  Rene Harris was elected as president.
 
Meanwhile, in parliamentary elections held in May 2003, Nauru First Party won 3 seats and independents garnered 15 in total.
 
In late June 2004,  Nauru's former parliament speaker Ludwig Scotty became the country's new president.  His presidency followed the exit of outgoing President Rene Harris following yet another non-confidence measure. 

For his part, Scotty had resigned as parliamentary speaker in April 2004 in protest of the Nauru's financial crisis which included the commencement of receivership proceedings by corporate giant, General Electric.  During that period, Nauru faced the seizure of its assets if the country  failed to honor its debt payments.  

Since Scotty's resignation as parliamentary speaker, the parliament was unable to convene as members of parliament could not decide whom to appoint as his replacement.  The scenario led to a political crisis, the financial crisis notwithstanding.   

In mid-2004, the government of Australia sent envoys to help Nauru deal with its  financial crisis.  By August 2004, a report by the Australian Center for Independent Studies suggested that Nauru might consider relinquishing its independent status in favor of becoming an Australian territory.  The report called for radical economic reform as well as the restructuring of both governmental instruments and public service.  The author of the report has offered Nauru economic advice in the past.

== Districts ==

==National Security==

'''External Threats'''

No foreign power poses an immediate threat to the Nauru ’s national security. Per an informal agreement, Australia assumes responsibility for its national defense.

'''Crime'''

Partially at the behest of the international community, Nauru ’s government no longer sanctions certain activities that, while technically legal, could serve to facilitate criminal activity. In 2003, it ended the controversial practice of selling its passports. It also banned offshore banks. In 2005, Nauru was still placed on the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering's (FATF) List of Non-Cooperative Countries (NCCTs). A division of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the FATF was created in 1989 to address global concerns over the proliferation of money laundering. A generally low rate of petty crime in Nauru has been reported.

'''Insurgencies'''

There are no insurgent movements operating inside or outside of Nauru that directly threaten its government or general population.

'''Terrorism'''

There is no specific threat of terrorism against Nauru, nor has it been a traditional target of terrorist violence. In November 2004, the government of Nauru passed four pieces of anti-terrorism legislation in an effort to begin complying with the international rules regarding terrorism.

== Foreign relations ==


'''General Relations'''


Nauru maintains economic, cultural and administrative ties with its South Pacific neighbors through joint airline services, fishing operations and through the Pacific Islands Commission. Nauru is particularly close to the governments of Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, sharing a common goal to improve the regional economy.

Nauru became a full member of the British Commonwealth in May 1999. Since independence in 1968, Nauru had been a special member of the Commonwealth with no authoritative power.

In May 1999, Nauru applied for United Nations membership.


'''Regional Relations'''


For a country of its size, Nauru has been playing a significant role in the developments in the South Pacific region. And it has not shied away from taking hard stands on issues that severely embarrassed or angered much larger and powerful countries. Nauru has not even spared its immediate neighbors and largest trading partners, Australia and New Zealand.

Nauru began its stridently independent foreign policy by targeting the two neighbors. Along with United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand were responsible for the large scale and indiscriminate mining of phosphate on the tiny island for most of the 20th century. The mining left an ecological and economic disaster for Nauru to handle when the country achieved independence in 1968. After filing a claim for $72 million with the International Court of Justice at The Hague in 1993, Nauru received compensation for ecological damage caused by the phosphate operations of Australia, Britain and New Zealand. The Australians settled out of court and Britain and New Zealand each contributed $8 million. The issue of environmental damage will continue to be a priority for the government of Nauru in the next several years.

Today, Nauru is almost totally dependent on trade with New Zealand, Australia and Fiji. Arable land is very limited as are all other natural resources, now that its long-time economic base of phosphate mines has been almost completely depleted.

Meanwhile, Nauru has taken the lead in generating international support for the separatist movement in the eastern Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, bordering Papua New Guinea. In September 2000 during the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in New York, Nauru's President Bernard Dowiyogo raised the issue of independence for Irian Jaya, also known as West Papua. Dowiyogo later raised the same issue at the summit meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum held in the Kiribati capital Tarawa in November 2000. Not content with this, in December 2000, Dowiyogo appealed to the United States to intervene in the region to settle the issue of Irian Jaya. In a letter addressed to the then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Dowiyogo urged the United States to "make every effort to resolve the crisis in West Papua in an early and peaceful fashion."


'''Other Significant Relations'''


Nauru's application for admission to the United Nations was questioned by China due to its close diplomatic and trade links with Taiwan. Nevertheless, Nauru gained admittance as a U.N. member state on Sept. 14, 1999.

In late July 2002, Taiwan cut its diplomatic ties with Nauru. Taiwan and Nauru had shared diplomatic ties for 22 years; Taiwan has enjoyed diplomatic ties with several Pacific countries even in the face of the "One China" policy by Beijing. Nevertheless, this 22-year long legacy was broken when Nauru's president decided to change its allegiance and establish formal relations with China. The move effectively shifted diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, thus angering the government of Taiwan, which described the shift in polity as "reckless." Nauru's decision to recognize Beijing via the signing of diplomatic papers and a joint communiqué will result in the cessation of Taiwanese aid. Nauru instead received a USD $150 million aid package from Beijing.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Nauru}}
Nauru is a small, oval-shaped island in the western Pacific Ocean, 42 km (26 mi.) south of the Equator. The island is surrounded by a coral reef, exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles. The reef is bound seaward by deep water, and inside by a sandy beach. The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a [[seaport]], although sixteen artificial [[Canals in Nauru|canals]] have been made in the reef to allow small boats to access the island. A 150&ndash;300 m (about 500&ndash;1000 ft.) wide fertile coastal strip lies landward from the beach. Coral cliffs surround the central plateau, which is known on the island as Topside. The highest point of the plateau is 65 m (213 ft.) above sea level. The only fertile areas are the narrow coastal belt, where [[coconut palm]]s flourish. The land surrounding [[Buada Lagoon]] supports [[banana]]s, [[pineapple]]s; vegetable,  [[Pandanus tectorius|pandanus trees]] and indigenous hardwoods such as the [[Calophyllum inophyllum|tomano tree]] are cultivated. The population of the island is concentrated in this coastal belt and around Buada Lago.

[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref>]]
Nauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean (the others are Banaba (Ocean Island) in [[Kiribati]] and Makatea in [[French Polynesia]]); however, the phosphate reserves are nearly depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 m (49 ft.) high. A century of mining has stripped and devastated four-fifths of the land area. Mining has also had an impact on the surrounding [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] with 40% of marine life considered to have been killed by silt and phosphate run off.<ref name = "climate">Republic of Nauru. 1999. [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] URL accessed 2006-05-03.</ref>

There are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru. Roof [[rainwater tank|storage tanks]] collect rainwater, but islanders are mostly dependent on a single, aging [[Desalination|desalination plant]]. Nauru's climate is hot and extremely humid year-round, because of the proximity of the land to the [[Equator]] and the ocean. The island is affected by [[monsoon]]al rains between November and February. Annual rainfall is highly variable and influenced by the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]], with several recorded droughts.<ref name="UNCCD">Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment. 2003. [http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref> The temperature ranges between 26 and 35&nbsp;°C (79 and 95&nbsp;°F) during the day and between 25 and 28&nbsp;°C (77 and 82&nbsp;°F) at night. As an island nation, Nauru may be vulnerable to [[climate change|climate]] and [[Sea level rise|sea level change]], but to what degree is difficult to predict; at least 80% of the land area of Nauru is well elevated, but this area will be uninhabitable until the phosphate mining rehabilitation program is implemented.<ref name = "climate">Republic of Nauru. 1999. [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref>

There are only sixty recorded [[vascular plant]] species native to the island, none of which is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]]. Coconut farming, mining and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.<ref name="UNCCD">Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment. 2003. [http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref> There are no native land mammals; there are native birds, including the endemic [[Nauru Reed Warbler]], insects and land crabs. The [[Polynesian Rat]], cats, dogs, pigs and chickens have been introduced to the island.

{{main|Economy of Nauru}}
Nauru's economy depends almost entirely on declining phosphate deposits; there are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.<ref name="Mining">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/332164.stm Big tasks for a small island] URL Accessed 2006-05-10</ref></small> Small-scale mining is still conducted by the NPC. The government places a percentage of the NPC's earnings in the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves have been exhausted. However, a history of bad investments, financial mismanagement, overspending and corruption has reduced the Trust's fixed and current assets. For example, [[Nauru House]] in [[Melbourne]] was sold in 2004 to finance debts and [[Air Nauru|Air Nauru's]] last [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-400]] was repossessed in December 2005.<ref>McAloon. C.

Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy, because there are few facilities for tourists; the [[Menen Hotel]] and [[OD-N-Aiwo Hotel]] are the only hotels on the island.

In the 1990s, Nauru became a [[tax haven]] and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee. The inter-governmental [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)]] then identified Nauru as one of 15 "non-cooperative" countries in its fight against [[money laundering]]. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, following which foreign [[hot money]] flowed out of the country. In October 2005, this legislation—and its effective enforcement—led the FATF to lift the non-cooperative designation.<ref>FATF. October 13, 2005.

==Human Rights==

The Republic of Nauru is a parliamentary democracy. The government works to respect the civil and human rights of its citizens and the foreign workers who live on the island. When individual abuses do occur, the law provides means for investigating and prosecuting offenders. In recent years, only a few offenses were reported. Judicial delays and spartan living conditions for asylum seekers were reported.  As such, Nauru has one of the best human rights records internationally.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Nauru}}
[[Image:Nauru_Denigomodu-Nibok.jpg|left|thumb|230px|Nauruan districts of [[Denigomodu]] and [[Nibok]].]]
Of the island's 13,048 residents, 58% are [[Nauruan people|Nauruan]], 26% other Pacific Islanders, 8% Chinese and 8% Europeans.<ref name="CIA">[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/nr.html CIA World Fact Book] URL Accessed 2006-05-02</ref> The official language of Nauru is [[Nauruan language|Nauruan]], a distinct Pacific island language. [[English language|English]] is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce. 

The main religion practised on the island is [[Christianity]] (two-thirds [[Protestantism|Protestant]], one-third [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]). The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]]; however, the government restricts this right in some circumstances, and has restricted the practice of religion by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and members of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], most of whom are foreign workers employed by the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.<ref>US Department of State. 2003. [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24314.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2003 - Nauru] URL accessed 2005-05-02.</ref>

An increased standard of living since independence has had some negative effects on the population. Nauruans are among the most [[obesity|obese]] people in the world, with 90% of adults overweight.<ref> [http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/B924BFA6-A061-43AE-8DCA-0AE82A8F66D2/0/obesityinthepacific.pdf Obesity in the Pacific: too big to ignore]. 2002.

Literacy on the island is 97%, education is compulsory for children from six to 15 years of age (Years 1&ndash;10), and two non-compulsory years are taught (Years 11 and 12).<ref>Waqa, B. 1999. [http://www2.unesco.org/wef/countryreports/nauru/contents.html UNESCO Education for all Assessment Country report 1999 Country: Nauru] URL Accessed 2006-05-02.</ref> There is a campus of the [[University of the South Pacific]] on the island; before the campus was built<!--in what year?-->, students travelled to Australia for their university education.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Nauru}}
[[Image:Linkbelt1999-Finalspiel.jpg|right|thumb|230px|The 1999 [[Australian rules football]] grand final, played at Linkbelt Oval]]
Nauruans descended from Polynesian and Micronesian seafarers who [[Nauruan indigenous religion|believed]] in a female deity, Eijebong, and a spirit land, an island called Buitani. Two of the 12 original tribal groups became extinct in the 20th century. [[Angam Day]], held on [[October 26]], celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two world wars, which together reduced the indigenous population to fewer than 1500. The displacement of the indigenous culture by colonial and contemporary, western influences is palpable. Few of the old customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.

There is no daily news publication, but there are several weekly or fortnightly publications, including the ''Bulletin'', the ''Central Star News'' and ''The Nauru Chronicle''. There is a state-owned television station, Nauru Television (NTV) which broadcasts programmes from New Zealand, and there is a state-owned non-commercial radio station, Radio Nauru, which carries items from [[Radio Australia]] and the [[BBC]].<ref>BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1134221.stm Country Profile: Nauru]. URL Accessed 2006-05-02.</ref>

[[Australian rules football]] is the most popular sport in Nauru; there is an [[Australian rules football in Nauru|elite national league]] with seven teams. All games are played at the island's only stadium, [[Linkbelt Oval]]. Other sports popular in Nauru include [[softball]], [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[sailing]], [[tennis]], and [[football (soccer)|soccer]]. Nauru participates in the [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Summer Olympic Games]], where it has been successful in [[weightlifting]]; [[Marcus Stephen]] has been a prominent medallist and was elected to parliament in 2003.  Nauru's two best tennis players, David Detudamo and his sister [[Angelita Detudamo]], are currently under athletic scholarships in the United States.  David plays for Cameron University in Oklahoma and Angelita plays for Collin County in Texas. 

A traditional activity is catching [[Noddy (tern)|noddy]] birds when they return from foraging at sea. At sunset, men stand on the beach ready to throw their [[lasso]] at the incoming birds. The Nauruan lasso is supple rope with a weight at the end. When a bird approaches, the lasso is thrown up, hits or drapes itself over the bird, and then falls to the ground. The captured noddies are cooked and eaten.<ref> [http://www.banaban.com/natalie.htm  Banaba/Ocean Island News]. URL Accessed 2006-05-11.</ref>
