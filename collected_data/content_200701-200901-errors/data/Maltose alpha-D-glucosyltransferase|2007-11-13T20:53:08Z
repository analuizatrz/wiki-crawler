In [[enzymology]], a '''maltose alpha-D-glucosyltransferase''' ({{EC number|5.4.99.16}}) is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]]

:maltose <math>\rightleftharpoons</math> alpha,alpha-trehalose

Hence, this enzyme has one [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], [[maltose]], and one [[product (chemistry)|product]], [[alpha,alpha-trehalose]].

This enzyme belongs to the family of [[isomerase]]s, specifically those intramolecular [[transferase]]s transferring other groups.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is '''maltose alpha-D-glucosylmutase'''. Other names in common use include '''trehalose synthase''', and '''maltose glucosylmutase'''.  This enzyme participates in [[starch and sucrose metabolism]].
