'''''Kim Possible''''' is a [[Disney Channel]] original [[Emmy]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] about a teenage crimefighter of the [[Kim Possible (character)|same name]] who has the task of dealing with worldwide, family, and school issues every day.  The show is fairly action-oriented, but also has a strong, light-hearted comedic atmosphere and often lampoons conventions and clichés of the secret-agent and action hero genres.

==About the show==
[[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] (voiced by [[Christy Carlson Romano]]) often finds herself criss-crossing the globe in an attempt to rescue people, stop crimes, and battle [[supervillain]]s... all the while being expected to come home and complete her homework in time.  Kim Possible attends [[Middleton (Fictional)|Middleton]] High School, and is captain of the school's [[cheerleading]] squad.  However, the red-haired crime fighter cannot save the world alone.  Alongside her is [[Ron Stoppable]], her goofy, wisecracking partner and boyfriend, and his scene-stealing pet [[naked mole rat]], [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]].

The series premiered in June [[2002]], and the first episode to air, ''Crush'', was nominated for a Primetime Emmy award the following year.  With the premiere of this episode, ''Kim Possible'' was regarded as the most watched and highest rated television show on the Disney Channel at that time. The series as a whole was nominated for the Daytime equivalent in [[2004]], and again in 2005 (that year saw it receive 5 nominations with 1 win).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278866/awards Awards for "Kim Possible"] (2006), retrieved [[August 4]], [[2006]].</ref> The show has widely been praised for its smart dialogue, fluid animation, and engaging, well-written characters (both heroic and villainous). 

Kim has faced many different foes and villains throughout her career. She has dealt with evil weather controlling machines, super fast growing grass and one time even being placed under mind control by her arch foe Doctor Drakken. Many of her villains also point out the clichés of villainy often saying it's old or classic.

Kim's dialogue tends to be peppered with not-so-typical teen [[slang]]; for example, "So not the drama" and "No big", as well as the series' catchphrase, "What's the sitch?" (situation).  

The show's title music, ''Call Me, Beep Me'', is sung by [[Christina Milian]].  Much of its artistic style is due to character development by artist [[Stephen Silver]].

''Kim Possible'' also airs on [[Toon Disney]] and [[Family Channel]] in Canada. A Mandarin version aired on [[CCTV 12]] in China, and an [[Arabic]] dub was also made which started airing on Dubai TV in early [[2006]] and is currently airing on [[MBC 3]] on the network's "Disney morning timeslot", the only thing that was changed were the character's names, for example Kim was called "''Damo staheel''" (Mostaheel is Arabic for [[Impossible]]), Ron was called "''Mostah aed''", Wade was called "''Awad''", Shego was called "''Shahira''", and Dr. Drakken was called "''Daraken''".

According to creators [[Mark McCorkle]] and [[Bob Schooley]], they created the show in an elevator. As they tell it, McCorkle looked at Schooley and said, "Kim Possible: she can do anything."  Schooley at once replied, "Her partner is Ron Stoppable: he can't do anything."  The creators also maintain that it was always their intention for Kim and Ron to eventually become involved romantically, instead of remaining best friends.  This becomes reality in the supposed series ending movie "Kim Possible: So the Drama."  The romantic theme also continues in season four. 

On February 22, [[2005]], after 3 seasons and 65 episodes, the show ended production. However, due to the popularity of the series and grassroots operations by dedicated ''KP'' fans, Disney announced on [[November 29]], [[2005]] that the show would be renewed  for a fourth season, which debuted on Disney Channel on February 10, 2007.<ref> Disney aired the season premiere episode on disneychannel.com until February, 10, 2007.

She has been Ron's best friend since Pre-K, and has been his girlfriend since the night of their prom. Naturally, her name makes reference to the word 'impossible.' 
* [[Ron Stoppable]] - Kim's best friend since Pre-K, partner, and now boyfriend; he also saves the world from time to time. His name is either a play on the word 'unstoppable' or is supposed to contrast with Kim's name, 'possible', with 'stoppable'.  
* [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]] - Ron's pet [[Naked Mole Rat|naked mole rat]], considered a member of the team---in fact, he often proves to be more competent than Ron or even Kim on occasions.
* [[Wade (Kim Possible)|Wade]] - The ten-year-old super genius (completed high school and college in 8 months) who spends the majority of his time in his room (until the episode ''Team Impossible''). He is often shown drinking soda. He runs Kim's website, supplies her with gadgets, assigns her missions, and arranges transportation for her. His last name is never revealed, though at one point in early development he was known as "Wade Load."
