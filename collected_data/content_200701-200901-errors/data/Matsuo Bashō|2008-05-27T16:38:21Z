{{nihongo|'''Matsuo Bashō'''|松尾 芭蕉||extra=[[1644]] – [[28 November]] [[1694]]}} was the most famous [[poet]] of the [[Edo period]] in [[Japan]]. During his lifetime, Bashō was recognized for his works in the collaborative ''[[haikai no renga]]'' form; today, after centuries of commentary, he is recognized as a master of brief and clear ''[[haiku]]''. His poetry is internationally renowned, and within Japan many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites.

Bashō was introduced to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the literary scene of [[Edo]] he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made a living as a teacher, but was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing and haiku. His poems are influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.

==Early life==
[[Image:MatsuoBasyoSeika.jpg|thumb|left|Bashō's supposed birthplace in [[Iga Province]]]]

Bashō was born {{nihongo|'''Matsuo Kinsaku'''|松尾 金作}} around 1644, somewhere near [[Ueno, Mie|Ueno]] in [[Iga Province]].<ref>Translations of Bashō's ''hokku'' are quoted or adapted from Ueda 1992; the biographical information is taken from Ueda 1982 and 1992.</ref> His father may have been a low-ranking [[samurai]], which would have promised Bashō a career in the military but not much chance of a notable life. It was traditionally claimed by biographers that he worked in the kitchens.<ref>Carter 1997, p. 62</ref> However, as a child Bashō became a servant to {{nihongo|Tōdō Yoshitada|藤堂 良忠}}, who shared with Bashō a love for ''haikai no renga'', a form of cooperative poetry composition. The sequences were opened with a verse in the 5-7-5 [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] format; this verse was named a ''hokku'', and would later be renamed ''haiku'' when presented as stand-alone works. The ''hokku'' would be followed by a related 7-7 addition by another poet. Both Bashō and Yoshitada gave themselves ''haigo'', or ''haikai'' [[pen name]]s; Bashō's was {{nihongo|Sōbō|宗房}}, which was simply the [[on'yomi]] reading of his samurai name of {{nihongo|'''Matsuo Munefusa'''|松尾 宗房}}. In 1662 the first extant poem by Bashō was published; in 1664 two of his hokku were printed in a compilation, and in 1665 Bashō and Yoshitada composed a one-hundred-verse ''renku'' with some acquaintances.

Yoshitada's sudden death in 1666 brought Bashō's peaceful life as a servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but it is believed that Bashō gave up the possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto ''[[miko]]'' named Jutei, which is unlikely to be true.<ref>Okamura 1956</ref> Bashō's own references to this time are vague; he recalled that "at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that "there was a time when I was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love", but there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or even fictional ones.<ref>Ueda 1982, p. 22.</ref> He was even conflicted over whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, "the alternatives battled in my mind and made my life restless."<ref>Ueda 1982, p. 23.</ref> His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of ''renga'' and ''haikai no renga'' as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors.<ref>Ueda 1982, p. 9.</ref> In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published his own compilation of other authors, {{nihongo|''Seashell Game''|貝おほひ|Kai Ōi}}, in 1672. In roughly the spring of that year he moved to [[Edo]] to further his study of poetry.

==Rise to fame==
In the fashionable literary circles of [[Nihonbashi]], Bashō's poetry was quickly recognized for its simple and natural style. In 1674 he was inducted into the inner circle of the ''haikai'' profession, receiving secret teachings from Kitamura Kigin (1624–1705).<ref>Carter 1997, p. 62.</ref> He wrote this ''hokku'' in mock tribute to the [[Shogun]]:

:''kabitan mo / tsukubawasekeri / kimi ga haru''
::the Dutchmen, too, / kneel before His Lordship— / spring under His reign. [1678]

He gave himself the ''haigo'' of Tōsei and by 1680 he had a full-time job teaching twenty disciples who published {{nihongo|''The Best Poems of Tōsei's Twenty Disciples''|桃青門弟独吟二十歌仙|Tōsei-montei Dokugin-Nijukasen}}, advertising their connection to Tōsei's talent. That winter, he took the surprising step of moving across the river to Fukagawa, out of the public eye and towards a more reclusive life.<ref>Carter 1997, p. 57</ref> His disciples built him a rustic hut and planted a {{nihongo|banana tree|芭蕉|bashō}} in the yard, giving Bashō a new ''haigo'' and his first permanent home. He appreciated the plant very much, and was not happy to see Fukagawa's native [[miscanthus]] growing alongside it:

:''bashō uete / mazu nikumu ogi no / futaba kana''
::by my new banana plant / the first sign of something I loathe— / a miscanthus bud! [1680]

With this success, however, grew dissatisfaction and loneliness. He began practicing [[Zen]] [[meditation]] but apparently it did not soothe his fears. In the winter of 1682 the hut burned down, and his mother died early in 1683. He then traveled to [[Yamura]] to stay with a friend. In the winter of 1683 his disciples gave him a second hut in Edo, but his spirits did not improve. Instead, after publishing another compilation, {{nihongo|''Shrivelled Chestnuts''|虚栗|Minashiguri}}, he left Edo in 1684 on the first of four major aimless wanderings.

Traveling in medieval Japan was immensely dangerous, and at first Bashō expected to simply die in the middle of nowhere or be killed by bandits. As the trip progressed, his mood improved and he became comfortable on the road. He met many friends and grew to enjoy the changing scenery and the seasons. His poems took on a less introspective and more striking tone as he observed the world around him:

:''uma wo sae / nagamuru yuki no / ashita kana''
::even a horse / arrests my eyes—on this / snowy morrow [1684]

The trip took him from Edo to [[Mount Fuji]] to Ueno and [[Kyoto]]. He met several poets who called themselves his disciples and wanted his advice; he told them to disregard the contemporary Edo style and even his own ''Shrivelled Chestnuts'', saying it contained "many verses that are not worth discussing".<ref>Ueda 1992, p. 122</ref> He returned to Edo in the summer of 1685, taking time along the way to write more ''hokku'' and comment on his own life:

:''toshi kurenu / kasa kite waraji / hakinagara''
::another year is gone / a traveler's shade on my head, / straw sandals at my feet [1685]

When Bashō returned to Edo he happily resumed his job as a teacher of poetry at his Bashō Hut, although privately he was already making plans for another journey. The poems from his journey were published as {{nihongo|''Account of Exposure to the Fields''|野ざらし紀行|Nozarashi kikō}}. In early 1686 he composed one of his best-remembered haiku:

:''furuike ya / kawazu tobikomu / mizu no oto''
::old pond / a frog jumps / the sound of water [1686]

Apparently this poem became instantly famous: by April the poets of Edo gathered at the ''bashō'' hut for a ''haikai no renga'' contest on the subject of frogs that seems to have been a tribute to Bashō's ''hokku'', which was placed at the top of the compilation.<ref>Ueda 1992, p. 138</ref> Bashō stayed in Edo, continuing to teach and hold contests, with an excursion in the autumn of 1687 when he traveled to the countryside for [[tsukimi|moon watching]], and a longer trip in 1688 when he returned to Ueno to celebrate the [[Japanese New Year|Lunar New Year]]. At home in Edo, Bashō sometimes became reclusive: he alternated between rejecting visitors to his hut and appreciating their company.<ref>Ueda 1992, p. 145</ref> At the same time, he enjoyed his life and had a subtle sense of humor, as reflected in his ''hokku'':

:''iza saraba / yukimi ni korobu / tokoromade''
::now then, let's go out / to enjoy the snow... until / I slip and fall! [1688]

==''Oku no Hosomichi''==
{{mainarticle|Oku no Hosomichi}}

Bashō's private planning for another long journey culminated on [[16 May]] [[1689]] (Yayoi 27, [[Genroku]] 2), when he left Edo with his student and apprentice {{nihongo|Kawai Sora |河合 曾良}} on a journey to the Northern Provinces of [[Honshu]]. Bashō and Sora headed north to [[Hiraizumi]], which they reached on [[June 29]]. They then walked to the western side of the island, touring [[Kisakata]] on {{nowrap|[[July 30]]}}, and began hiking back at a leisurely pace along the coastline. During this 150-day journey, Bashō traveled a total of 600&nbsp;''[[Japanese units of measurement#Length|ri]]'' (2,400 km) through the northeastern areas of Honshu. He returned to [[Edo]] in late 1691.

By the time Bashō reached [[Ōgaki, Gifu|Ōgaki]], [[Gifu Prefecture]], he had completed the log of his journey, {{nihongo|''The Narrow Road to the Back (Country)''|奥の細道|Oku no Hosomichi}}. It is often considered his finest achievement, featuring ''hokku'' such as:

:''araumi ya / Sado ni yokotau / amanogawa''
::the rough sea / stretching out towards Sado / the Milky Way [1689]

==Later life==
On his return to Edo in the winter of 1691, Bashō lived in his third ''bashō'' hut, again provided by his disciples. This time, he was not alone; he took in a nephew and his female friend, Jutei, who were both recovering from illness. He had a great many visitors.

[[Image:MatsuoBasho-Haka-M1932.jpg|thumb|right|Bashō's grave in [[Otsu, Shiga|Ōtsu, Shiga Prefecture]]]]

Bashō continued to be uneasy. He wrote to a friend that "disturbed by others, I have no peace of mind".<ref>Ueda 1992, p. 348</ref> He made a living from teaching and appearances at ''haikai'' parties until late August of 1693, when he shut the gate to his ''bashō'' hut and refused to see anybody for a month. Finally, he relented after adopting the principle of ''karumi'' or "lightness", a semi-Buddhist philosophy of greeting the mundane world rather than separating himself from it. Bashō left Edo for the last time in the summer of 1694, and spent time in Ueno and Kyoto before coming to Osaka. He became sick with a stomach illness and died peacefully, surrounded by his disciples. He left as a sort of [[death poem]] the ''hokku'':

:''tabi ni yande / yume wa kareno wo / kake meguru''
::falling sick on a journey / my dream goes wandering / over a field of dried grass [1694]

==Influence and literary criticism==
Rather than sticking to the formulas of {{nihongo|''[[kigo]]''|季語|}}, which remain popular in Japan even today, Bashō aspired to reflect his real environment and emotions in his ''hokku''. Even during his lifetime, the effort and style of his poetry was widely appreciated; after his death, it only increased. Several of his students compiled quotations from him about his own poetry, most notably Mukai Kyorai and Hattori Dohō.<ref name="page7">Ueda 1992, p. 7</ref>

During the 18th century, appreciation of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru went to great length to find references in his ''hokku'' to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, some of which were probably literary [[false cognate]]s. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.<ref name="page7"/>

It was not until the late 19th century that this period of unanimous passion for Bashō's poems came to an end. [[Masaoka Shiki]], arguably Bashō's most famous critic, tore down the long-standing orthodoxy with his bold and candid objections to Bashō's style. However, Shiki was also instrumental in making Bashō's poetry accessible to leading intellectuals and the Japanese public at large. He invented the term ''[[haiku]]'' (replacing ''hokku'') to refer to the freestanding 5-7-5 form which he considered the most artistic and desirable part of the ''haikai no renga''.<ref name="page7">Ueda 1992, p. 7</ref>

Critical interpretation of Bashō's poems continued into the 20th century, with notable works by Yamamoto Kenkichi, Imoto Nōichi, and Ogata Tsutomu. The 20th century also saw translations of Bashō's poems into languages and editions around the world. His position in Western eyes as the ''haiku'' poet ''par excellence'' gave him great influence, and by virtue of Western preference for ''haiku'' over more traditional forms like the ''tanka'' or ''renga'', have rendered him the archetype of Japanese poets and poetry. The impressionistic and concise nature of his verse influenced particularly [[Ezra Pound]] and the [[Imagism|Imagists]], and later the poets of the [[Beat Generation]].<ref>See, for instance, Lawlor 2005, p. 176</ref> [[Claude-Max Lochu]], on his second visit to [[Japan]], created his own "travel painting", inspired by Bashō's use of travel as inspiration. [[Robbie Basho]] and [[Steffen Basho-Junghans]] were also inspired by him.
