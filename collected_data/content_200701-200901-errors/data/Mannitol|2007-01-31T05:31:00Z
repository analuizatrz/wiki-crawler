'''Mannitol''' or  '''hexan-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol''' (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>) is an [[osmosis|osmotic]] [[diuretic]] agent and a weak [[kidney|renal]] [[vasodilator]]. It is a [[sorbitol]] [[isomer]].

==Chemical properties==
Chemically, mannitol is an [[alcohol]] and a [[sugar]], or a [[polyol]]; it is similar to [[xylitol]] or [[sorbitol]].  However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a [[hydrogen]] [[ion]] in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become [[acid]]ic. For this, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its [[pH]], such as [[sodium bicarbonate]].

==Uses==
Mannitol is used clinically to reduce acutely raised [[intracranial pressure]], until more definitive treatment can be given, e.g. after [[head trauma]], and to treat patients with [[oliguric renal failure]].  It is administered [[intravenous]]ly, and is filtered by the [[glomerulus]] of the [[kidney]], but is incapable of being reabsorbed from the [[renal tubule]], resulting in decreased water and [[Sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup> reabsorption via its [[osmosis|osmotic]] effect.  Consequently, mannitol increases water and Na<sup>+</sup> excretion, thereby decreasing extracellular fluid volume. 

Mannitol can also be used to open the [[blood-brain barrier]] by temporarily shrinking the tightly coupled [[endothelial cell]]s that make up the barrier.  This makes mannitol indispensable for delivering various drugs directly to the [[brain]] (e.g. in the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]]).

Mannitol is also used as a [[sweetener]] for people with [[diabetes]]. Since mannitol has a negative [[heat of solution]], it is used as a sweetener in "breath-freshening" candies, the cooling effect adding to the fresh feel. In doses larger than 20g, mannitol acts as a [[laxative]], and is sometimes sold as a laxative for children. 

It is sometimes used as an [[adulterant]] or [[cutting agent]] for [[heroin]], [[methamphetamine]]s or other [[illicit drug]]s. In popular culture, when it is used in this manner, it is often referred to as ''baby laxative''.  Many television shows and films depicting drug culture make such references to ''baby laxative'' when in fact they are referring to Mannitol.{{fact}}

Mannitol can also be used to temporarily encapsulate a sharp object (such as a helix on a lead for an [[artificial pacemaker]]) while it is passing through the venous system.  Because it dissolves readily in blood, the sharp point will become exposed by the time it reaches its destination.

Mannitol may be admininstered in cases of severe [[Ciguatera]] poisoning.  Severe [[ciguatoxin]], or "tropical fish poisoning" can produce stroke-like symptoms.

Mannitol is a non-permeating molecule i.e. it cannot cross biological membranes.

Mannitol is commonly used in the circuit prime of a [[heart lung machine]] during [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] (CPB). The presence of mannitol preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of [[endothelial cell]]s in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage.
