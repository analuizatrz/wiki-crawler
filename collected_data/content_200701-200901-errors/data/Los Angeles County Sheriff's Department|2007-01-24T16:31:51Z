The '''Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department''' ('''LASD''') is a local law enforcement that serves the [[unincorporated]] areas of [[Los Angeles County, California]].   It is the equivalent of the [[county police]] for unincorporated areas of the county as well as [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as "[[contract city|contract cities]]" in local jargon).  The '''Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department''' is sometimes referred as as the '''Los Angeles Sheriff's Office''' ('''LASO'''). 
==Statistics==
The LASD is the largest [[sheriff]]'s department in the [[United States]] with over 16,000 employees. [[Leroy D. Baca]] is the current sheriff.

LASD deputies provided law enforcement services to 2,557,754 residents in an area of 3,171 square miles both in the [[unincorporated]] County land and within the contract cities (1995 figure).  

The Sheriff's Department also operates one the largest jail systems which provides short-term incarceration services for all of the County (including the cities like [[Los Angeles]] which have their own police departments).  The [[Men's Central Jail]] (MCJ) and [[Twin Towers Correctional Facility]] (TTCF) are located in a dense cluster northeast of [[Los Angeles Union Station|Union Station]] that is next to the station's rail yard.  The [[North County Correctional Facility]] (NCCF) is the largest of the four jail facilities locacted at the [[Peter J. Pitchess Detention Center]] in [[Castaic, California]].

Some of the newer contract cities like [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] have never had police departments.  When their city governments were founded, they took over what was formerly unincorporated land, but then contracted their police responsibilities right back to the county sheriff.  Since the sheriff already had substations in those areas anyway, the result was to maintain the status quo.  

In contrast, [[Compton, California]], used to have a police department, but in 2000 the city council voted to dismantle the police department and become a contract city. Compton has been at times notorious for [[gang]] violence.
==Achievements==
The LASD has gained an international reputation for its efforts in developing and integrating the latest law enforcement technologies, especially nonlethal weapons.  Because many developers, especially those developing technologies for the U.S. Department of Defense, have little idea of the needs of domestic law enforcement, the LASD provides experts to assist in the development and implementation of technologies that will be of service to law enforcment when fully mature.  In the late 1990's the LASD successfully designed a county wide sound recorder/meter system to detect loud noises and relay that info with [[GPS]] tracking to computers at both Communications and Deputies' vehicles. Towers are methodically located in area's of the county that on a 24-7 basis seek out sounds that could be relevant to crimes and has a 97% success rate of accurately sorting gunshots vs fireworks and things like loud pets. "The History Channel"{{fact}} When dispatch has a call from a citizen reporting possible gunfire near their residence, these sound towers can pinpoint within about 25 to 30 feet where the shots were coming from and record the sound for investigative purposes, and at the same time, relay the GPS info to HQ and deputies on the street. The system is up and running and has already been responsible for the arrest of a felony shooting suspect.

Currently the LASD is working with the Federal Aeronautics Administration and local government officials to deploy their remote control aerial surveillance drone system.  This would allow the Sheriff's Department to have real time imagery from the streets of Los Angeles to combat street violence and record crimes in progress, not mention searching for missing hikers, "patrolling" behind the surf zones of the beaches and looking for lost children. The drones are not intended to replace police helicopters, but in specific incidents could be of better and cheaper to use.

==Controversy==
Ironically for a law-enforcement agency, the Sheriff's Department was sued for violating the law regarding copyright infringement in 2006.  As is the typical practice with large organizations which have a number of computers, the Sheriff's Department routinely would load all of the software which would be used on its computers onto an image used to create each computer to be used, which would then be customized as needed.  While the department had, in the case of the software in question, 3,663 licenses, it had preloaded the software on over 6,000 machines.  The department argued this was [[fair use]] since the software was blocked by a license management system unless the particular user had a valid license.  The court, however decided this represented an unauthorized and unlicensed commercial use of the software and was illegal.

==Television shows based on LASD==
In the late 1950's, a short lived "[[Dragnet (drama)]]"-style [[television series]], "Code 3", aired based on real cases (though names and locations were changed) from the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]].  The late [[Eugene Biscailuz]], then [[Sheriff]] of [[Los Angeles County]], was featured in a cameo tag line at the end of every episode. 

The department's Emergency Services Detail (ESD) which functions under the unbrella of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) was depicted in the short lived [[television series]], ''[[240-Robert]]''. The SEB also includes the Canine Services Detail (K-9), and the Special Enforcement Detail (SED) which is the department's special weapons team.

In September 2003, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] premiered ''[[10-8: Officers on Duty]]'' a prime time drama (with a light comedy twist) based on a rookie with the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]].  The show lasted one season.  The show's name was based on the police radio code for "on duty".
