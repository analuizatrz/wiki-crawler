'''Swiftfox''' is a freely downloadable [[open source]] [[graphical user interface|graphical]] [[web browser]] that is a [[Binary file|binary]] optimized [[Software build|build]] of the [[Mozilla Firefox]] [[web browser]] for [[Linux]] that was created by Jason Halme. To optimize for each of the supported [[Microprocessor|microprocessor architecture]]s, separate specific builds are created. The current version of Firefox is available as well as the development versions, each having specific builds. Firefox [[Extension (Mozilla)|extensions]] and [[plugins]] are fully compatible with Swiftfox.

== Optimization ==

Swiftfox is optimized using the following methods:

'''Binary code optimization'''
*Compiled with the highest level of compiler optimization, rather than optimization for binary size.
** Swiftfox is compiled -O3,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://forums.getswiftfox.com/viewtopic.php?t=44 | title=Swiftfox Forum}}</ref><ref name=build20>Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds</ref>
**Firefox is compiled -Os<ref name=build20>Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds</ref>(which is less than -O2 <ref name=gccopt>{{cite web | url=http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.1/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options | title=Optimize Options - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)}}</ref>).
*[[Binary file|Binaries]] incorporate additional [[instruction set]]s.<ref name=change20>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/mozilla_1_8_branch/changelog | title=Swiftfox 2.0pre changelog}}</ref>
** [[Intel]] and [[AMD]]: [[SSE2]], [[SSE]], [[MMX]], (not generally [[SSE3]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://forums.getswiftfox.com/viewtopic.php?t=11&highlight=sse3 | title=Swiftfox Forum}}</ref>).
** [[AMD]] only: [[3DNow!]]
*Optimization specific to the build microprocessor architecture.<ref name=change20>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/mozilla_1_8_branch/changelog | title=Swiftfox 2.0pre changelog}}</ref>
** [[Intel]]: [[Pentium 4]], [[Pentium III|Pentium 3]], [[Pentium M]], [[Pentium III|Pentium 3M]], [[Pentium 2]], [[Pentium 4#Prescott|Prescott]], [[Celeron]] (various).
** [[AMD64]]: [[Athlon64]] (32bit binary).
** [[AMD]]: [[Athlon XP]] [[Duron]] [[Sempron]], [[Athlon]], [[K6-2]].
*Compiled with newer version of [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (Firefox 2.0 uses 3.3.2, Swiftfox 2.0 uses 4.0.4).<ref name=build20>Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds</ref>
'''Increased Security'''
*Better protection from buffer overflow attacks<ref name=fortify>{{cite web | url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/009jul05/features/execshield/#checks | title=redhat.com | Limiting buffer overflows with ExecShield}}</ref> (Swiftfox 2.0 uses -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2; Firefox 2.0 uses gcc 3.x, which does not support this).<ref name=build20>Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds</ref>
'''Removed or disabled features'''
*[[Pango]] is not included.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://builder.com.com/5100-6375-5136890.html | title=Open Source Awards 2004: Pango}}</ref> This means that [[Unicode typefaces|Unicode fonts]] remain supported (see [[Unicode and HTML]]), but without certain extra features provided by [[Pango]].<ref name=pangoexample>{{cite web | url=http://www.pango.org/ScriptGallery | title=Script Gallery - Pango }}</ref>
*[[IPv6]] [[DNS]] lookups are disabled.<ref name=change15>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/releases/changelog | title=Swiftfox 1.5.0.7 changelog}}</ref><ref name=change20>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/mozilla_1_8_branch/changelog | title=Swiftfox 2.0pre changelog}}</ref>
'''Changed default preference values'''
*[[HTTP pipelining]] is enabled by default.<ref name=change15>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/releases/changelog | title=Swiftfox 1.5.0.7 changelog}}</ref><ref name=change20>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/mozilla_1_8_branch/changelog | title=Swiftfox 2.0pre changelog}}</ref> Note that [[Fasterfox]] provides a [[GUI]] to adjust these settings.

==Speed==
Swiftfox has been evaluated in the context of the fastest browsers.<ref name=benchswift>{{cite web | url=http://www.apcstart.com/node/3097 | title=APC Magazine: What's The Worlds Fastest Browser| accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref> It is central to evaluate the claim of Swiftfox being faster than Firefox,{{cn}} as implied by its name.{{cn}} No explicit claim of speed or speedup is made at the Swiftfox site, but simply that it is an "optimized build".

===Firefox speed===
{{Content}}
{{dablink|see [[Firefox#Performance]]}}
Firefox has been criticised for slow startup compared with other browsers, a criticism confirmed by Firefox speed tests<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/Mozilla-Firefox-Review-13677.shtml  | title = Mozilla Firefox Review | work = Softpedia | accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref><ref name=benchgeneral>{{cite web | url=http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html | title=Browser speed comparisons}}</ref>. A speed comparison of various Linux (and other) browsers has been done<ref name=benchgeneral>{{cite web | url=http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html | title=Browser speed comparisons}}</ref>. In this 32bit only test, Firefox was slower than both [[Opera_%28Internet_suite%29|Opera]] and [[Konqueror]]<ref name=benchgeneral><ref name=benchgeneral>{{cite web | url=http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html | title=Browser speed comparisons}}</ref>.

===Swiftfox speed===
No definitive speed comparison has been reported, but an unspecified faster startup time together with a 1.7% webpage rendering speedup has been reported<ref name=benchswift>{{cite web | url=http://www.apcstart.com/node/3097 | title=APC Magazine: What's The Worlds Fastest Browser| accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref>. The details of this test are a page rendering in 4.79 seconds for Firefox and 4.67 seconds for Swiftfox, both 32bit on 64bit system. There is a bigger speed advantage of Opera and Konqueror over Firefox<ref name=benchgeneral>{{cite web | url=http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html | title=Browser speed comparisons}}</ref><ref name=benchswift>{{cite web | url=http://www.apcstart.com/node/3097 | title=APC Magazine: What's The Worlds Fastest Browser| accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref>, than Swiftfox over Firefox<ref name=benchswift>{{cite web | url=http://www.apcstart.com/node/3097 | title=APC Magazine: What's The Worlds Fastest Browser| accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref>. There was no benchmarking on different processors, so builds optimized for different processors were not evaluated, nor discussed.

==Additional options==
Swiftfox contains the following Firefox plugins and extensions: 
*[[XForms]] extension is installed and enabled
*libunixprintplugin.so plugin is installed

==Downloads available==  	 
*Current version of Firefox:
**Builds for both both [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] processors - a different build is available for each processor type.
*Development versions of Firefox:
**Builds for [[AMD]] [[Athlon XP]] processors and sometimes [[Intel]] [[Pentium 4]] (and compatible).

== License ==
{{POV-section|Summary of factual problems and fixes|date = November 2006}}
The Swiftfox source code is partially [[open source]], with some of the source code under [[Mozilla Public License|MPL 1.1]]. However, according to the Swiftfox license<ref name=license/>, parts of the code relating to branding are withheld.<br> 
The binaries are distributed under the Swiftfox license<ref name=license>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/LICENSE | title=Swiftfox license}}</ref>, which is proprietary. Unlike the [[Mozilla Public License|MPL 1.1]] that Firefox and the Swiftfox code distributed under, the Swiftfox license dose not allow redistribution. According to the author, this is to prevent the possibility of any confusion with tainted versions. But Swiftfox is trademark Jason Halme, and could not be used on any other 3rd party Firefox or Swiftfox build or version without his permission.

==Licences of other builds==
{{Content}}
Firefox and its code, which Swiftfox is based on, use the [[Mozilla Public License|MPL 1.1]]. Mozilla also uses trademark law to stop unauthorized 3rd party builds like Swiftfox and [[IceWeasel]] from using its name and/or logos<ref name=policy>{{cite web | url=http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html | title=Mozilla trademark policy}}</ref>.

== Alternatives ==
* Firefox source code is freely available for download, as are the Swiftfox changes.
