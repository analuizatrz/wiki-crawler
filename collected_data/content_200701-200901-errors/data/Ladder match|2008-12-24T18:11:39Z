A '''[[ladder]] match''' is a type of [[Professional wrestling match types|match used in professional wrestling]] that is most commonly used to describe a match where an item (usually a title belt) is hung above the ring, and the winner is the contestant who climbs a ladder and retrieves the item.<ref name="WWE">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/laddermatch|title=Inside WWE > Specialty Matches |accessdate=2007-07-17 |publisher=WWE}}</ref> The ladder itself becomes a key feature of the match, as wrestlers will use the ladder as a weapon to strike the opponent(s), as a launching pad for acrobatic attacks, and frequently these matches include impressive falls from the top of the ladder.<ref name="WWE"/>.  However, there were very few matches in which the hung item must be used in a special manner in order to win the match, such as striking the opponent with the item (see Goldberg Vs. Scott Hall Tazer match, where one must strike the opponent with the Tazer, regardless of who retrieved the Tazer first).

Ladder Matches are often used as a finale to storylines and it is more common to have symbolic briefcases (usually "containing" a contract for a future championship match) or championships belts hung above the ring.  Ladder matches and their variants (such as TLC and Full Metal Mayhem) are often used in fueds that involve a dispute over possesion of an item (such as a stolen title belt or the "paperwork" for the contractual services of a manager).  Ladder matches are almost always fought under [[hardcore wrestling|no disqualification]] rules.

==Origins==
The Ladder Match could have been invented by either [["Cowboy" Dan Kroffat|Dan Kroffat]] of the [[Stampede Wrestling]] organization out of [[Calgary, Alberta]], [[Canada]] or British wrestler Kendo Nagasaki. In September 1972, Stampede Wrestling held the first-ever Ladder Match between Dan Kroffat and [[Tor Kamata]], where the object to be grabbed was a wad of money. <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/information/history/ladder.html |title=History of the Ladder match |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=OnlineWorldofWrestling.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> In 1971 Kendo Nagasaki competed in a ladder match on the popular world of sport.

In July 1983 Stampede Wrestling held a Ladder Match where [[Bret Hart]] faced off against [[Bad News Allen|Bad News Brown]]. Hart went on to join the WWF and suggested this type of match to promoter [[Vince McMahon]], where the gimmick achieved its current popularity.

==Other variations==
*'''[[King of the Mountain match]]''' - Used in TNA; essentially a ladder match in reverse, the winner (referred to as the "King of the Mountain") is the first person to attach the object specified beforehand (usually a championship belt) to the wire above the ring.
*'''[[Ultimate X match]]''' - Used in TNA; essentially a ladder match contested by the TNA X-Division. The match features a structure that consists of two wires strung above the ring, forming an 'X'. The wrestlers climb the structure that holds the wires, makes their way across the wires to the center of the structure, and retrieves the 'X' while hanging from the wires. 
*'''Stairway to Hell''' - Used mainly in ECW; in this variation instead of a title being suspended above the ring there's a weapon, usually a ball of barbed wire. Once you've taken down the weapon you are then free to use it, you win the match via pin or submission the same as a singles match.
*'''[[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]]''' - Variation of the ladder match where tables and chairs are also permitted (and their use is encouraged). Referred to at times simply as TLC matches.
*'''[[Money in the Bank ladder match]]''' - Ladder match where multiple competitors try to climb a ladder to obtain a contract for a future World Title shot against any champion within the next 12 months. Challenger chooses time and place. Match has taken place at every [[WrestleMania]] since [[WrestleMania 21]].
