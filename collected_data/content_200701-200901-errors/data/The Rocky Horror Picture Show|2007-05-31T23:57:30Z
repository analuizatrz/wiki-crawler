'''''The Rocky Horror Picture Show''''' (''RHPS'') (first released in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[14 August]], [[1975]]) is a [[cult classic]] [[film]] directed by [[Jim Sharman]] from a [[screenplay]] by Sharman and [[Richard O'Brien]]. The film was based on O'Brien's long-running stage production ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''.  After an unexceptional first run, the movie went on to become a runaway smash that continues to be shown on weekends in many cinemas (usually at midnight).<ref> Rocky Horror Picture Show theater locator http://www.rockyhorror.com/participation/showingslist_listings.php?type=r</ref>  Fans often attend viewings dressed as characters from the film and respond ritualistically to certain events by throwing food, using props, yelling jokes, dancing, and cheering.

Reaction to the campy as well as controversial topics featured in the film have overshadowed the film's other achievements. The film spoofs a number of horror films where innocent companions are compelled to enter a strange old mansion. Frankenstein's monster Rocky, is the doomed creation of the mad doctor 'Frank 'n' Furter's laboratory experiment; the twist is that Rocky is a beautiful [[blond]] man rather than a disfigured creature. Rocky is later killed by Riff Raff's raygun as Rocky carries Dr. F's body up a replica of the [[RKO|RKO tower]] in an apparent homage to the film [[King Kong]] (Frank 'n' furter mentions the female star of that film, [[Fay Wray]], in his floorshow song "Wild & Untamed Things". 

The film stars [[Barry Bostwick]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Tim Curry]]. Little [[Nell Campbell]], [[Patricia Quinn]], [[Peter Hinwood]], [[Jonathan Adams]], [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], and [[Richard O'Brien]] are featured in supporting roles, while British character actor [[Christopher Biggins]] appears in the chorus. [[Meat Loaf]] (then almost unknown as a singer - having recorded one obscure album with a fellow cast member from the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and being part-way through production of his iconic album, ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]'') makes a brief appearance for one song. Curry, O'Brien, Quinn, Campbell and Adams were in the original cast of the play, and Meat Loaf joined them when the show originally went to the [[United States]] at [[The Roxy Theatre]] in Los Angeles.

In 2005, The United States [[National Film Preservation Board]] added ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' to the [[National Film Registry]].

==Plot==

The film begins with a pair of disembodied red lips singing against a black background in the opening song. The lips belong to Patricia Quinn (Magenta), though the song is dubbed over by Richard O'Brien. The sequence was inspired by a painting by [[Man Ray]]. The lips sing the opening song (''[[Science Fiction, Double Feature]]''), as the opening credits apear with the classic blooddrop lettering.

The story unfolds with straitlaced couple Brad Majors ([[Barry Bostwick]]) and Janet Weiss ([[Susan Sarandon]]) musically pledging their [[engagement]] after attending the [[wedding]] of their friends, the Hapschatts, where Janet catches the bouquet (''[[Dammit Janet]]'').  

The movie is narrated and commented on by the [[criminologist]] ([[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]). This is a direct parody of the faux-documentary style of many 1950s and '60s sci-fi movies. The [[criminologist]] reveals that this was a night Brad and Janet "...are going to remember for a very long time".

While driving through the rain their car gets a flat tire and they must walk back to a remote castle "in the middle of nowhere" in hopes of finding a telephone. (''Over at the Frankenstein Place'').  Upon their arrival at the sinister castle they are welcomed by handyman Riff-Raff ([[Richard O'Brien]]) and domestic servant Magenta ([[Patricia Quinn]]), and are whisked into a hallucinogenic dance sequence (''[[The Time Warp]]''), the movie's trademark song.

Brad and Janet are then introduced to Dr. Frank N. Furter ([[Tim Curry]]), owner of the castle and host of the party, who describes himself as a ''sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania'' (''Sweet Transvestite'').  (Later it is revealed that Frank, Riff-Raff and Magenta are in reality aliens from the planet Transsexual, in the galaxy of Transylvania.) Meanwhile, Magenta and Riff Raff strip Brad and Janet of their wet clothes, to the delight of Frank's groupie, the tap-dancing Columbia ([[Nell Campbell|"Little" Nell Campbell]]), leaving them in their simple white underwear, later to be covered by white lab coats.

[[Image:Hotpatootie!.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Meat Loaf singing ''Hot Patootie.'']]

In a scene lifted from any given Frankenstein movie, Frank animates a body he has created, an attractive muscleman/playmate, who he claims "is good for relieving his tension". Rocky ([[Peter Hinwood]]) is initially [[shell-shock]]ed by his return to life (''Sword of Damocles'') and is frantically chased by Frank.

Eddie ([[Meat Loaf]]) emerges from a deep freeze storage vault on his motorcycle. An 'ex-delivery-boy', with a scar across his forehead from surgery wherein Frank stole half his brain to fill Rocky's head, Eddie, is also Columbia's lover (''[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)]]''). Frank murders Eddie with a pickaxe in a jealous rage (''I Can Make You a Man: Reprise''). Frank and Rocky perform a mock bridal procession to a specially-prepared boudoir.

Later that night, Frank appears to Janet in the guise of Brad, and then later he appears to Brad dressed as Janet. After a token protest both eagerly accept his sexual advances.

Meanwhile, Riff and Magenta amuse themselves by watching the seductions on TV monitors and by teasing and tormenting Rocky. The monster flees outside into the still-pouring rain. Rocky, dirty and injured, goes back to his birth-tank to cower.

In a deleted scene, Brad (with Frank asleep in his bed) repudiates Frank's advances and rededicates himself to Janet and his love for her, although she cannot hear this (''Once in a While'').

Janet sees the surveillance of Brad in bed with Frank, then discovers Rocky crying in his tank. She decides to act upon the sexual feelings Frank awakened within her (and the anger Brad's cheating sparked), and seduces Rocky (''[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a Touch Me]]''), all gleefully spied on by Magenta and Columbia via monitor.

[[Image:Patricia Quinn.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Richard O'Brien, Tim Curry and Patricia Quinn in ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show,'' settling down to eat Eddie's corpse.]]

Next, Brad, Frank and Riff arrive at the lab. Frank sees the surveillance of a stranger, and Brad recognizes the man as one Dr. Everett Scott, his old science teacher. Frank does not believe this is a coincidence and accuses Brad of a conspiracy. Dr. Scott ([[Jonathan Adams]]) enters the building. Frank uses a magnetic device to bring him to the lab, where he bursts through the wall. 

During the ensuing scene, we learn that Dr. Scott is Eddie's uncle, and Brad learns that Janet is intimate with Rocky. ("Janet!" "Dr. Scott!" "Janet!" "Brad!" "Rocky!" "Unh?" "Janet!" "Dr. Scott!" "Janet!" "Brad!" "Rocky!" "Unh?").  During the very awkward formal dinner that follows, Dr. Scott explains that he has come in search of Eddie. Frank, perturbed by this discovery (referring to this as a "tender subject"), yanks the tablecloth away to reveal Eddie's dismembered body.  His guests are horrified to find that Eddie was in fact their main course. (Interestingly, the actors' reactions to the coffin-table's corpse are genuine as the set-piece was kept secret.)

Frank tries to seize Janet (''Planet Schmanet Janet'') and a chase scene ensues with all the main characters dashing about the castle, eventually ending up in the laboratory where Frank uses the "Medusa Ray" to turn them into naked statues (''You're a Hot Dog'').

Frank then dresses each one and initiates the floor show, during which the characters are released from their suspended animation one by one to sing and dance in a [[cabaret]] act (''Rose Tint My World/Wild and Untamed Thing'') featuring Frank as the star.  At the conclusion of the floor show, the characters plunge into a huge swimming pool where, with running makeup and sodden satin, all begin [[caress]]ing and kissing each other (''Don't Dream It, Be It'').

In the midst of this [[orgy]], Magenta and Riff arrive and announce that they are assuming control of 'the mission' and will be returning them back to Transsexual, Transylvania. Frank receives this with a [[melodrama]]tic ballad (''I'm Going Home''), but Riff says that only he and Magenta are returning.  As Riff is about to shoot, Columbia screams; Riff kills her with his [[ray gun]], then turns it on Frank and fires.  A distraught Rocky, in a scene reminiscent of [[King Kong]], carries Frank's body to the top of a small artificial [[RKO Radio]] tower. Riff shoots Rocky several times but Rocky's innate strength keeps death at bay. He dies as the RKO tower can't hold the weight and collapses, plunging them both into the swimming pool.  Riff and Magenta cause the castle to blast off, taking them back to Transsexual (where they will once again freely dance ''The Time Warp''). Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott are released from the spell of the castle by Riff Raff and Magenta, left lying in an empty field where the castle once stood (''Super Heroes'').

== Production ==
Many of the original aspects from the stage production changed as did characters and dialogue but many of it's original production staff returned to work on the film. Director Jim Sharmen, Production Designer Brian Thompson and Costume Designer Sue Blane built the original London production with many of the actors that made it into the film version. Tim Curry reprised his role from the London and Los Angeles stage production. After the film, Curry also did a short run on Broadway as Furter. Richard O'Brien returned for the film as well but was not in the LA or NYC productions. Also returning from the British team was Little Nell, and Patricia Quinn.

One of the many changes from stage production to film included several ideas that never came about. The original opener was supposed to include clips from all the movies mentioned in the song "Science Fiction, Double Feature. Producers discovered quickly that obtaining the rights to all these various film clips would be very costly and cut the idea. Another idea was to parallel [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)]] movie by having the first 20 minutes of the film in black and white until the doors burst open showing the Transylvanians in full color. The two processes, color film and black and white turned out to be incompatible and nearly impossible to achieve in 1975, so this too was disregarded.

What did make it into the movie was an echo of old Hammer Horror films. A genre of its own, Hammer production had a style unique for it's time. Production Designer Brian Thompson and Drector Jim Sharmen chose locations, sets and even props that were, in some cases used in many old Hammer productions. The castle is known as the Hammer House for the number of films that it apeared in. Today the castle [[Oakley Court]] has been completely refurbished and is now a first class hotel. The classic "Creation" scene in Rocky Horror re-uses the tank from a Hammer production of "Horror of Frankenstien" starring [[Peter Cushing]].

In the stage productions actors generaly did their own make-up but for this film producers chose famed artist [[Pierre Laroche]] to redesign the make-up for each character. Laroche is also famouse for designing make up for David Bowie.

Production stills were taken by an artist famouse for his 1970's rock photograhs, [[Mick Rock]]. The photographer has published many Calenders and photo books from his Rocky Horror work, all of which are published out of Germany.

==Box office and theatrical run==
''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' has taken in over $139 million in box office receipts since its release, which makes it the highest grossing movie to have never played in more than 1,000 movie theatres at the same time. The length of its run in cinemas (weekly for over 30 years) combined with its considerable total box office gross is unparalleled by any other film.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/records/limited_releases.php Rocky Horror atop the list of highest grossing films never to play in more than 1,000 theaters]</ref> The original budget for the movie was a tight $1 million. While filming, the crew went over budget, adding to the initial financial failure of the film. Many of the actors earned very little from the movie, both at its initial release and after it became popular.

The [http://www.museum-lichtspiele.de/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=33&Itemid=16/ Museum Lichtspiele] in Munich, Germany has been screening the movie without interruption since September 19th, 1975, and is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.

The [http://www.garlandtheatre.com/ Garland Theater] in [[Spokane, Washington]] shows it at least twice a month as well as on Halloween.

==Critical Response==
Taken at [[face value]], the film could be considered ground-breaking for its frank (albeit comical) depiction of subjects such as [[transvestism]], [[homosexuality]], [[cannibalism]], [[voyeurism]], [[adultery]], and even [[incest]]. In addition, the scripting and [[design]] displays the writers' knowledge of the [[history of cinema]] even beyond the [[Horror film|horror]] and [[science fiction]] [[film genre]]s; for example, there are references to films as diverse as ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'', ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Rope|Rope]]'', and ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. Nevertheless, the film did not do well initially when released. One reason was probably poor choice of theater placement, with the studio booking the film in socially [[American conservatism|conservative]] towns such as [[Santa Barbara, California]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==[[Cult following|Cult Following]]==
The film opened in the US at the United Artist Theatre in Westwood, California on September 26th 1975. Although the theatre was selling out every night, it was noted that many of the same people were returning to see the movie. This turned out to be an exception, not the rule as it was not doing well elsewhere in the US.<ref>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book" by Bill Henkin, page 25, paragraphs 1 & 2.</ref> 

The film began its midnight run at the Waverly Theatre in New York on April 1st, 1976.<ref>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book" by Bill Henkin, page 26 4th paragraph</ref>  People began shouting responses to the [[fictional character|characters]]' statements on the screen. These mostly include [[melodramatic]] abuse of the characters or [[actor]]s, vulgar sex jokes, [[pun]]s, or [[pop culture]] references. Soon it had caught on at other locations as well in a midnight slot. All across the country people were lining up to see this unique film experience.

From coast to coast Rocky Fans were lining up just before midnight. In San Francisco at the Strand Theatre on Market Street fans came to see the well organized troup there performing with sets and props like a profsessional theatre troup. Today this is the norm at most theatres showing Rocky Horror. In Los Angelos Fans included a true life transexual performong as Frank N Furter at the Tiffany Theatre on Hollywood Blvd, just a few blocks away from the Roxy Theatre where Rocky Horror made it's American debute.

Other [[audience participation]] includes dancing the [[Time Warp]], throwing [[toast]], [[water]], [[toilet paper]], [[hot dogs]], [[underwear]], and [[rice]] at the appropriate points in the movie (many [[theatre]]s forbid throwing things that are difficult to clean up, such as [[confetti]], [[butter]]ed toast, and sometimes rice).  Fans often attend shows dressed up as the characters, while an onstage "shadowcast" will act out the movie in front of the screen. At the now defunct Key Theater in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]], the theatre manager would ride his motorcycle down the aisle during Meat Loaf's/Eddie's song, "Hot Patootie."  Audience members also use newspapers to cover their heads and [[squirt gun]]s for rain during the "Over at the Frankenstein Place" musical sequence, and use noise makers during the scene in which Rocky is unveiled. The whole phenomenon got a boost in 1980, with the release of the movie ''[[Fame (movie)|Fame]]'', in which some characters attend a screening of ''Rocky Horror'' at the [[Eighth Street Playhouse]].  At times, the management of the theatres were as much a fan as the audience; for example, one could gain free entry by wearing one's underwear on the outside.

===Audience Participation===
There are many aspects and levels to "participating" at a showing of this movie. Many people just yell at the screen while others go much deeper. Many people develop over time into diehard fans. During the song "Time Warp" in many theatres nearly everyone stands up and does the dance. Costumes, props, and verbal dialoque are all tools in "Participating".

===Presentation===
What were ''ad lib'' responses, more commonly known as "Call Backs" by followers, from the audience are now, in a few locales, as tightly scripted as any [[screenplay]].   Audience members who provide "incorrect" or poorly timed responses may find themselves angrily shouted down just as if they were being disruptive in a normal movie. However, creative new lines are usually applauded and even added to the local repertoire.

There have been audience participation [[album]]s recorded and scripts published.  However, most fans feel that it is preferable for responses to grow organically from the local culture.  For example, the audience members in [[Salt Lake City]] have utilized frequent references to the [[Mormon]] [[church]] and [[Brigham Young University]]. In most locales, new responses are regularly added to the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] (for example the introduction of references to ''[[South Park]]'' character [[Timmy (South Park)|Timmy]] at times when the [[paraplegic]] Dr. Scott is in a scene).  Additionally, in some areas, the AP lines take note of current events (for example, the use of the name of a recent famous deceased in the line "SHOW ME ''NAME''", when Riff-Raff opens the coffin at the beginning of the Time Warp).

Some [[art film|arthouse]] cinemas will have a tradition of regularly playing the film on a particular date, especially [[Halloween]].  While the film &mdash; and associated live cast performances &mdash; are less popular than in its heyday, regular weekend showings can still be found in select American and Canadian cities.

In cinemas where the film plays on a regular or semi-regular basis, groups of fans have formed casts. These casts act out the movie on a stage or on the floor in front of the movie scene. While some casts are very laid back, others have become very strict. Many casts require auditions to join in which a prospective member must show that he or she can perform the movie from memory without looking at the screen. Among Rocky Horror casts there is a perpetual quest for "screen-accuracy", meaning that everything from costumes to props to the motions that actors make on stage match the movie exactly. Costume designer [[Sue Blane]]'s original designs for the film are recreated by fans in great detail. Costumes range from the very simple to extremely elaborate. Fans can be very serious about their recreations and take great pride in entering costume contests at conventions and debating various techniques and materials used to build them.

31 years after the film's original release, [[Lima]], [[Peru]] celebrated its first "audience participation" show. The venue was "El Cinematografo de [[Barranco]]", an independent arthouse theater in one of the most bohemian districts of Lima.

Largest showing ever: over 8,000 fans at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in September 2005, featuring [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] cast Midnight Insanity, a troupe performing weekly since 1988, currently at the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'' in Long Beach.

==Sequel==

''[[Shock Treatment]]'', a follow-up to ''RHPS'', was made, but despite its appeal to cult audiences and its campy nature, it has not caught on as well as the original.  It features O'Brien, Quinn, Campbell and Gray in different roles and the characters Brad and Janet, played by different actors. Originaly set to be filmed in an America on location, due to the actors strike of 1980 production for this film returned to England for filming. Re-writes provided for a unique aproach to the story.

== Unmade Films ==

Two further films, ''[[Rocky Horror Shows His Heels]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Old Queen]]'', were written by O'Brien but never filmed. (''Shock Treatment'', the "equal" to ''Rocky Horror'', had its American premiere and advanced screening in Fresno, California in August 1981. Among the guests that night included the films star and author Richard O'Brien. Fresno is also part of the setting location in the more literal "sequel" script ''Revenge of the Old Queen'' where O'Brien's character Riff Raff reappears back on Earth.)

Starting around  the year 2000 word on the street had it that between other projects Richard O'Brien was working on a new sequel. Richard O'Brien confirmed this himself in 2001 during a public appearance in Manchester, UK.  However, unlike previous attempts, this was to be a sequel to the original play on which the movie was based and would be performed on stage.

The title ''Rocky Horror: The Second Coming'' has been floated as a potential title but O'Brien himself seems conflicted on the issue of what the eventual title would be. O'Brien has stated that the plot would include elements from both ''Rocky Horror Shows His Heels'' and ''Revenge of the Old Queen''. Like ''Rocky Horror Shows His Heels'' the play would be set nine months after the events of ''The Rocky Horror Show'' and would feature a pregnant Janet carrying either Frank's or Rocky's child. O'Brien also leaked that one of the songs would be called "'''Frankie Phoenix'''" and that it would illustrate Frank-N-Furter's resurrection. If the play is ever produced and becomes a financial hit, there is the possibility it could take the path of its predecessor and eventually become a film. But, after several false starts, it now looks as if the project may have fallen into [[development hell]].


== Trading Cards ==

Two sets of official [[trading cards]] have been released. The first, from 1980, features 60 cards. The first ten cards feature a publicity portrait of a cast member (with the tenth card being a group shot of the Transylvanians). Cards 11-59 tell the story of the film with a picture on the front and a brief caption on the reverse. Card 60 is a checklist for the set. The second set, part of the 1995 20th Anniversary celebration, consists of 96 cards. Cards 1-90 again feature publicity stills of the cast (some of them the same stills as the earlier set, re-cropped) and tell the story of the film with more extensive captioning. There is no checklist card. The set also features a three-card subset of Tim Curry in various poses and costumes, with foil imprinting, and a similar Brad and Janet three-card subset. This set was produced by [[Comics Images]].


== Comic Books ==

As part of the 15th Anniversary celebration, [[Caliber Press]] published a comic book adaptation of RHPS written and drawn by [[Kevin VanHook]] in 1990.  Also for the 15th Anniversary, a four-CD box soundtrack set was released. The set consists of: the original motion picture soundtrack; the ''Rocky Horror Show'' original Roxy cast recording; ''Songs from the Vaults'', rare tracks from various cast members, tracks from the ''Shock Treatment'' soundtrack and radio advertising spots for the original release; and ''Rocky Horror International'', a collection of tracks from cast recordings around the world along with the previously unreleased film cast recordings of ''The Sword of Damocles'', ''Once in a While'' and ''Planet, Schmanet, Janet''. Also included is a 24-page commemorative booklet.


== Alternative Soundtracks ==

The soundtrack ''[[The Rocky Horror Punk Rock Show]]'' performed by various punk bands including The Ataris, Tsunami Bomb, Alkaline Trio, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and others.

The [[Surround sound|surround]] mixes themselves did not appear on early prints of the movie.  In 1990, for the 15th anniversary of the film, and in conjunction with the film's first U.S. home video release, the audio for the film was remixed from mono into [[Chace Surround Stereo]].  The song dubs were replaced by the stereo version of songs from the soundtrack record. For the 25th anniversary edition, both the original mono track, and a new 5.1 surround mix (also done by Chace Productions) from the original dialogue/music/effects stems was created, which was far more accurate than the earlier stereo dub.

Richard O'Brien originally intended for the film to be in black and white, but the studio vetoed this in favour of a more conventional look. On the 25th Anniversary [[DVD]], an easter egg function simulates O'Brien's intended vision; the first 20 minutes are black and white, turning to colour when Riff Raff swings open the doorway during the Time Warp, revealing Transylvanians (a la ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''). To activate the [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]], scroll down to Scene Selection (don't select it) and push the left arrow button on the DVD remote. This should highlight a pair of lips, which, when selected, activates it.

===Computer games===

''The Rocky Horror Show'' computer game was produced for early 8-bit computers including the [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore 128]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] by the [[CRL Group PLC]] in 1985, to mixed reviews. The game involved playing as either Brad or Janet and collecting pieces of the Medusa machine scattered around the castle, in order to free your partner from stone and escape the castle before it blasts off. Meanwhile the other characters in the game can hinder your progress by stealing and hiding your clothes along with what you are carrying. Riff-Raff can kill the player with his laser gun, and Eddie can run the player over with his motorcycle should he thaw out and escape from his freezer. In 1999, an [[adventure game]] called ''The Rocky Horror Interactive Show'' was released to much hype but very little success. It was criticized for having a clumsy keyboard-only interface and outdated (2D) graphics. ''The Rocky Interactive Horror Show Game'' was released in March/April 1999 for the PC by On-Line PLC. Similarly to the earlier CRL game, the player plays as Brad or Janet and must rescue their partner from the castle. Unlike the older computer game, its gameplay was more puzzle-oriented, and benefited from the added detail, graphics, and live video sequences that the PC could provide. Despite this, it was criticised for a clumsy user interface and for using two-dimensional graphics, at a time when most games were using 3D.

==References in pop culture==
Because of the proliferation of the film into the mainstream and public consciousness, there have been numerous references to it within other media. Some notable references are listed below:

* In the 1978 [[Spider-Man]] [[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|live-action series]], Spider-Man tells one of his enemies: "you look like a reject from the Rocky Horror Picture Show!" [http://www.rockyhorror.org/faq/nf/m-rhel.html#2]
* In ''[[Fame (film)|Fame]]'' (1980), Ralph Garcy and Doris Finsecker attend a showing of "Rocky Horror" at the Eighth Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village, during which Doris joins the Time Warpers.  Sal Piro, one of the original instigators of the "live performance/audience participation" phenomena and now the Rocky Horror Fan Club president, makes a cameo during this scene as the MC of the "Rocky Horror" performance.
* In 1980, the late night comedy show ''[[Fridays (ABC TV Series)|Fridays]]'' had a skit called "The Ronnie Horror Picture Show," spoofing the election of President [[Ronald Reagan]]. The parts were cast to show members of the administration and songs were rewritten using the same melodies, but parody lyrics, describing the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] "takeover" of the country. This sketch aired only once because the producer protested against the movie being parodied without his permission{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.
* In "Vice Squad" (1981), a B rated low budget cop flick, the line to Rocky Horror at the Tiffany Theatre in Hollywood, CA. is shown during a car chase scene. Real fans from the theatre were filmed. Some were included in close up "reaction" shots.
* Tim Curry was the guest host of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with Meat Loaf as the musical guest in 1981. This show included a sketch with the two together called "Tim And Meat's One Stop Rocky Horror Shop".  [[Eddie Murphy]] also alluded heavily to Rocky Horror in the show's opening monologue with Curry.
* In the 1995 "[[A Star Is Burns]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Dr. Hibbert arrives at a film festival dressed as Frank, mistakenly thinking ''Rocky Horror'' was playing.
* In the 1997 episode "[[New York and Queens (Drew Carey Show episode)|New York and Queens]]" of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', Drew, Kate, Lewis and Oswald dress up for a midnight showing of ''Rocky Horror'', only to find that the theatre no longer shows the movie. In its place, the theatre now plays ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert]]'', attended by a costumed Mimi and Mr. Wick. A dance off between opposing fans to the tunes of "Time Warp" and "Shake Your Groove Thing" ensues. The episode ultimately ends with the police coming to the scene of the dance-off. Extras dressed as Rocky fans were cast members of Midnight Insanity of Long Beach, CA. Leroy from ''Fame'' appears as a Priscilla dancer. The show bought the rights to use the song "Time Warp", but not its dance choreography, which is why the steps seen are not the traditional moves.
* In the Halloween 2000 episode of ''[[That 70's Show]]'' ("[[Too Old to Trick or Treat, Too Young to Die]]"), Fez appears in a Frank-N-Furter costume through the entire show, even while his leg is broken and is confined to a wheelchair.
* In the 2002 ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' episode "Secrets and Loans...", Lorelai and Rory plan on seeing ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' (and dressing up as characters Magenta and Janet) to celebrate Rory's high [[PSAT]] score.
* In the opening credits of the 2002 film [[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]] , which is set in 2087 and stars Eddie Murphy and Rosario Dawson, you can see a theater advertising RHPS playing at midnight. 
* In ''[[Connie and Carla]]'' (2004), the drag queen duo of Peaches N'Cream perform [[The Time Warp]] for an audition at the club.
* The 2005 "Creatures of the Night" episode of the [[CBS]] series ''[[Cold Case]]'' involved a murder related to a screening of the movie. The episode features many of the songs from the movie, which are fully integrated into the storyline. Barry Bostwick played [[serial killer]] Roy Anthony, who is investigated in the crime.
* In [[The Venture Brothers]] episode "[[Return to Spider-Skull Island]]," the Venture family returns from an investigation at a local theater dressed as various characters from RHPS.  [[Dr. Venture]] is dressed as Frank-N-Furter, [[Brock Samson]] is Rocky Horror, [[Dean Venture]] is Riff Raff, [[Hank Venture]] is Columbia, and [[H.E.L.P.eR.]] is Magenta.
* In an episode of [[America's Funniest Home Videos]] a clip was shown that involved a mother finding her young son playing dress up with her lingerie, including fishnets and such. The host, [[Tom Bergeron]], said in a voice-over "I hope he's just going to The Rocky Horror Picture Show".
