'''Mobile''' ({{IPA2|moʊˈbiːl}}) [http://www.bartleby.com/61/wavs/93/M0359300.wav (pronunciation)]  is the third most populous city in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Alabama]]<ref name="citypop">{{cite web|title=''USA: Alabama''|work=CityPopulation.de|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/USA-Alabama.html|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>  and is the [[county seat]] of [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile County]]. The population of the city was 192,830 according to the 2006 estimate.<ref name=popest/>  It is the principal city of the Mobile [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Area]] (MSA), which has a July 1, 2006 census estimated population of 404,157.  Mobile is a part of the Mobile-[[Daphne, Alabama|Daphne]]-[[Fairhope, Alabama|Fairhope]] [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA) which has a population 588,246 as of the 2006 census estimates.

The city's name is derived from the presence of the Mobile (Mauvile or Maubila) [[Native Americans in the US|Indians]] in the area at the time of founding. <ref name="mgs">{{cite web|title=''Local History Information and Links''|work=Mobile Genealogical Society|url=http://www.siteone.com/clubs/mgs/history.htm|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> Mobile is the only saltwater port in [[Alabama]]. Located along the northwest shore of [[Mobile Bay]], the city began as the first capital of colonial [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] in [[1702]]. Over the past 300 years, Mobile has officially flown six flags, including [[France]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Spain]], the Republic of Alabama ([[1861]]), the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and the [[United States]]. <ref> [http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2255.html U.S. History, Retrieved May 5, 2007 ] </ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Mobile, Alabama}}

The settlement of Mobile, then called by the French name [http://www.thingstodo.com/states/AL/history.htm "Fort Louis de la Mobile"], was first established in [[1702]], at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the [[Mobile River]], as the first capital of the French colony of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. Following a series of floods, the town was relocated downriver to its present location near the head of [[Mobile Bay]] in [[1711]], with another wooden ''Fort Louis''.<ref name=MoMfort>

The capital of the [[Louisiana Territory]] was moved to [[Biloxi]] in [[1720]] and to [[New Orleans]] in [[1723]],<ref name=MoMfort/>

and Mobile was relegated to the role of frontier town and trading post.
In 1723, construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began, and was renamed as [[Fort Conde|Fort Condé]] in honor of King [[Louis XIV]]’s brother.<ref name=MoMfort/>

In 1763, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, ending the [[French and Indian War]]. The treaty ceded Mobile to [[Great Britain]], and under British rule the colony flourished. The British renamed the city [[Fort Charlotte (Mobile)|Fort Charlotte]], after the English Queen, and re-energized the port. Major exports included timber, naval stores, indigo, hides, rice, pecans and cattle. 

The immediate British enforcement of race codes threw the denizens of the French-derived culture into chaos. The [[French Creole]] world was noted for its [[laissez faire|laissez-faire]] attitude to racial matters, and the stringent English codes chased some of Mobile's Creole residents westward into Louisiana.
[[Image:Battle of Mobile Bay map.jpg|thumb|225px|left| '''Mobile''', Alabama (upper left), during the [[American Civil War]].]]

[[Battle of Fort Charlotte|The Spanish captured]] the port town in [[1780]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The fort was renamed as [[Fortaleza Carlota]], and the Spanish held Mobile until [[1813]], when it was captured by the American [[General]] Wilkinson. By then, it was the second largest seaport on the Gulf Coast.

From the middle of the [[19th century]] to the start of the [[20th century]], Mobile expanded into a cosmopolitan city of commerce maintaining its culture. The Cotton Boom and Mobile being one of the busiest ports in the United States brought the city recognition throughout the world.<ref name="SRG"/> 

During the [[American Civil War]], Mobile was a confederate city and in [[1864]] surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction after defending its port for a year. Ironically though, a year later, in [[1865]], the city suffered loss when some three hundred people died in an explosion at an ammunitions plant, which also destroyed a large portion of the city.<ref name="SRG"/>

After the war, the city revived and became a shipbuilding port churning out vessels for the military. One of the first [[submarine]]s was built in Mobile. [[World War II]] led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile's population, largely due to the building of Army, Air Force and Naval bases. By [[1956]], Mobile's metropolitan area tripled in growth. <ref name="SRG"/>

The 1960s brought about post war changes in Mobile's economy. Instead of shipbuilding, the paper industry began to flourish and military bases were converted to civilian uses. Mobile's seafood industry, notable for Mobile Bay oysters rose and fell in the last quarter of the twentieth century; leaving behind a few shrimpers hanging on to a uncertain future.<ref name="SRG"/>

In reference to Mobile's seafood industry, Mobile's eastern portion of the bay experiences a unique phenomenon called the [[Mobile Bay Jubilee|Jubilee]]. In the middle of warm nights, an upsurge from the bottom of the bay brings a variety of seafood delicacies. News quickly spread of this phenomena and brought about spur-of-the moment fishing parties known as the Jubilee. This phenomenon happens in [[Japan]] as well, and is thought to be caused by low oxygen levels in the water.<ref name="SRG"/>

Mobile's&nbsp;geographical location on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] provides a mild [[subtropical]] [[climate]], with an average annual temperature of 67.5 degrees. January through December temperatures range from 40 degrees min and 91 degrees max. The average annual precipitation of 66.29 inches benefits the lush vegetation of the region and makes Mobile the rainiest city in the contiguous United States ([[Ketchikan, Alaska]] ranks higher at nearly 100 inches per year). 
The National Climatic Data Center lists Annette Island station at over 100 inches of annual precipitation.<ref>http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ak/500352.pdf</ref><ref>Weatherbill Incorporated, 2007</ref> Mobile has warm summers with Gulf breezes and mild, wet winters. Being on the Gulf, Mobile is occasionally affected by major [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricanes]].<ref name="srg-climate">{{cite web|title=''Mobile's Climate''|work=SeniorsResourceGuide.com|url=http://www.seniorsresourceguide.com/directories/Mobile/about_region.html|accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> A 2007 study by WeatherBill, Inc. determined that Mobile is the wettest city in the United States, with more than 5 feet of rainfall annually. <ref>Thompsen, Andrea (May 22, 2007) [http://www.livescience.com/environment/070518_rainy_cities.html "Study Reveals Top 10 Wettest U.S. Cities."]</ref> Snow is rare in Mobile.

===Hurricanes===
Mobile suffered its worst natural disaster on [[September 12]], [[1979]] when Category 3 [[hurricane]] [[Hurricane Frederic]] slammed into the heart of the city.  The storm caused tremendous damage to nearby [[Dauphin Island, Alabama|Dauphin Island]] and [[Gulf Shores, Alabama|Gulf Shores]].  The city took over 5 years to fully recover from the devastating hurricane.

On [[September 16]], [[2004]], Mobile received a glancing blow from Category 3 [[Hurricane Ivan]] which made landfall in Gulf Shores, Alabama about 30 miles away. Mobile was caught in Ivan's western [[eye]] and the destruction was eerily similar to 1979's Frederic. Maximum winds were observed at [[U.S.S. Alabama|Battleship Park]] at 105 miles per hour. The recording equipment then stopped working. The city received 8 inches of rain in the 48 hours of Ivan's approach and passage.<ref name="HurIvan"|>{{cite web|title=" Powerful Hurricane Ivan Slams the IS Central Gulf Coast as an Upper Category-3 Storm"|work="National Weather Service Forecast Office Mobile/Pensacola"|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mob/ivan_page/Ivan-main.htm|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>

In August of [[2005]], Mobile received another glancing blow from [[Hurricane Katrina]]. A storm surge of 11.45 feet devastated eastern parts of Mobile.  The surge may have been the highest recorded in Mobile in over 85 years.<ref name'"HurKat">{{cite web|title="Extremely Powerful Hurricane Katrina leave a Historic Mark on the Gulf Coast|work="National Weather Service Forecast Office Mobile/Pensacola" |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mob/0805Katrina|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[Image:Mobile Alabama harbor aerial view.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the port of Mobile]] 

Over the past 5 years, Mobile is undergoing its greatest economic expansion in history.  With numerous local, national, and even international companies funneling over $9 billion into the city. Bringing its GMP to 22 Billion and has the potential getting as high as over 200 Billion making Mobile one of the top 10 Most Prosperus cities in the U.S. Mobile has seen job growth of nearly 22% in just the past 5 years with projections of an additional increase of more than 32% in the next 3 years, mainly due in part of the ThyssenKrupp steel plant and state dock expansions.  Mobile has seen its average wages surge over 30% since January 2004 mainly due in part to the Katrina disaster in late 2005 which forced employers to increase wages to remain competitive.  Mobile's unemployment rate is 5.1% and has been rapidly free falling for 2 years straight.  Due to the numerous new industries coming online in Mobile over the next three to five years, Mobile is projected to have an unemployment rate of less than 2.0% by the 4th quarter of 2010.

Homebuilding in Mobile increased over 15% from 2005 to 2007, and while it began to level off in early 2007, due to the ThyssenKrupp announcement, new home construction is projected to once again reach double digit increases by the end of 2007.  

Mobile's [[Port of Mobile|Alabama State Docks]] is currently undergoing the largest expansion in its history by expanding its container processing and storage facility and increasing container storage at the docks by over 1,000%. <ref>{{web cite|title="ALABAMA SENATE APPROVES  		PORT FUNDING - ALABAMA STATE PORT AUTHORITY POISED TO LET NEW CONTAINER  		TERMINAL CONTRACTS"|work="Alabama State Port Authority|date=[[2005-05-17]]|url=http://www.asdd.com/Asd/news47.htm|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> Mobile is also in the race to become home to the nations largest military contract in history, a $200+ Billion air force tanker project which would generate over 5,000 high paying jobs in Mobile, pushing the city to very front of becoming the nations most prosperous city. The rapidly growing auto industry in Alabama has resulted in over 2,800 new jobs created in Mobile.  

Since the Katrina disaster, Mobile has seen a housing boom of more than 3,500 new homes built in only the past 20 months, exceeding even the post World War II boom of the late 1940s.  

Since 1852, the Battle House hotel has been a fixture of the Mobile landscape. Although the original hotel was destroyed in a fire in 1905, it was rebuilt and has remained a Mobile area landmark. It was the location of [[Woodrow Wilson|President Woodrow Wilson's]] famous speech in 1913 where he declared that the US would never again fight in a foreign war of aggression. In 1974, the hotel went vacant, as much of downtown was doing at the time.

In 2001, the Mobile City Council approved a deal with the [[Retirement Systems of Alabama]] for a complete restoration of the historic hotel, as well as construction of the [[RSA Battle House Tower|Battle House Tower]], a 35-story, 745-foot (227 m) tall [[skyscraper]] which is the tallest building in Alabama. <ref>Jumper, Kathy, ''Massive undertaking required several contractors to finish Massive undertaking a multi-contractor job'', Mobile Register, [[May 6, 2007]], page L10</ref>

In 2007, [[Germany|German]] steel manufacturer [[ThyssenKrupp]] announced plans for a $4.2 billion  steel mill. The new plant will be built north of the city in [[Mount Vernon, Alabama]]. Officials say 29,000 people will be employed during construction and an additional 2,700 permanent jobs will be added. <ref> ''Mobile County Wins ThyssenKrupp Plant,'' [http://blog.al.com/live/2007/05/mobile_county_wins_thyssenkrup.html Press Register, 11-May 2007]</ref>

The Battle House Project is the crowning achievement of the "String of Pearls" initiative undertaken by the administration of former Mayor Mike Dow (1989-2005), which saw the construction of the Arthur Outlaw Convention Center and the Cruise Ship Terminal, the approval of the soon to be constructed Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico, and the complete rebirth of Dauphin Street, Mobile's historic commercial corridor. 

Other projects in the works include a number of high-rise condominium towers on Water Street in the heart of the downtown waterfront, as well as the construction of a historic [[Mardi Gras]] themed city park in downtown and a brand new state of the art federal courthouse. Large commercial ventures are in the works for the metropolitan area.
