'''André Derain''' ([[June 10]], [[1880]] &ndash; [[September 8]], [[1954]]) was a [[France|French]] painter and an illustrator.
==Biography==
Derain was born in 1880 in [[Chatou]], [[Île-de-France (région)|Île-de-France]]. 

He attended the Académie Camillo and studied with [[Eugène Carrière]]. At the académie he would become friends with [[Henri Matisse]], alongside whom he was considered one of the leaders of the [[Fauvism]] movement. In [[1900]], he met and shared a studio with [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and began to paint his first [[Landscape art|landscapes]]. 

Derain made his first impact on the Paris art scene in [[1905]], when he and Matisse displayed their highly innovative paintings at the [[Salon d'Automne]]. This exhibition led the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to dub them ''[[les Fauves]]'' (the wild beasts). In March 1906, the noted art dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] sent Derain to [[London]] to compose a series of paintings with the city as subject. In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain put forth a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as Whistler or Monet. With bold colours and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the [[Thames]] and [[Tower Bridge]]. To date, these London paintings remain among his most popular work. 

In [[1907]] he experimented with stone sculpture and moved to [[Montmartre]] to be near his friend [[Pablo Picasso]] and other notable artists. His work increasingly showed the influence of [[Paul Cézanne]] and of African art. Derain supplied woodcuts in primitivist style for an edition of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s first book of poetry, ''[[L'enchanteur pourrissant]]'' (1909), and illustrated a collection of poems by [[Max Jacob]] in [[1912]]. 

At about this time Derain's work began overtly reflecting his study of the [[Old Masters|old masters]]. The role of color was reduced and forms became austere; the years [[1911]]-[[1914]] are sometimes referred to as his [[Gothic art|gothic]] period. In 1914 he was mobilized for military service in [[World War I]] and until his release in [[1919]] he would have little time for painting, although in [[1916]] he provided a set of illustrations for [[André Breton]]'s first book, ''Mont de Piete''.

After the war, Derain won new acclaim as a leader of the renewed [[classicism]] then ascendant. With the wildness of his Fauve years far behind, he was admired as an upholder of tradition. In [[1919]] he designed the [[ballet]] ''La Boutique fantasque'' for [[Serge Diaghilev|Diaghilev]], leader of the [[Ballets Russes]]. A major success, it would lead to his creating many ballet designs.


The 1920s marked the height of his success, as he was awarded the [[Carnegie Prize]] in [[1928]] and began to exhibit extensively abroad — in [[London]], [[Berlin]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Düsseldorf]], and in [[New York City]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].

During the [[Germany|German]] occupation of [[France]] in [[World War II]], Derain lived primarily in [[Paris]] and was much courted by the Germans because he  represented the prestige of French culture. Derain accepted an invitation to make an official visit to [[Germany]] in [[1941]]. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] machine naturally made much of Derain's presence in Germany, and after the [[Liberation]] he was branded a collaborator and ostracized by many former supporters.

He died in [[Garches]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], Île-de-France, France.

Today, paintings by Derain sell for as much as US$6 million. The London paintings were the subject of a major exhibition at the [[Courtauld Institute]] in 2005-06.
