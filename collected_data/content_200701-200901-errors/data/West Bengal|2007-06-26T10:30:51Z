'''West Bengal''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: পশ্চিমবঙ্গ ''Poshchimbôŋgo'') is a [[States and territories of India|state]] in eastern [[India]]. With [[Bangladesh]], which lies on its eastern border, the state forms the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]]. To its northeast lie the states of [[Assam]] and [[Sikkim]] and the country [[Bhutan]], and to its southwest, the state of [[Orissa]]. To the west it borders the state of [[Jharkhand]] and [[Bihar]], and to the northwest, [[Nepal]]. 

The region that is now West Bengal was a part of a number of empires and kingdoms during the past two millennia. The [[British East India Company]] cemented their hold on the region following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757 CE, and the city of [[Kolkata]], then Calcutta, served for many years as the capital of [[British India]]. A hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]] through the early 20th century, [[Bengal]] was [[1947 Partition of Bengal|divided in 1947]] into two separate entities, West Bengal - a state of India, and [[East Pakistan]] belonging to the new nation of [[Pakistan]].

Following India's independence in 1947, West Bengal's economic and political theatres were dominated for many decades by intellectual [[Marxism]], [[Naxalite]] movements and [[trade union]]ism. From late 1990s, economic rejuvenation led to a spurt in the state's economic and industrial growth.<ref name=hdrchap1>{{cite book

Bengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]], in which [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary groups]] such as [[Anushilan Samiti]] and [[Jugantar]] were dominant. Armed attempts against the [[British Raj]] from Bengal reached a climax when [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] led the [[Indian National Army]] against the British.

{{Main|Culture of West Bengal}}
The [[Bangla language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, shared with neighboring Bangladesh.  West Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the ''[[Charyapada]]'', ''[[Mangalkavya]]'', ''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana]]'', ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'', and stories related to [[Gopal Bhar]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth century, [[Bengali literature]] was modernized in the works of authors such as [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] and [[Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]. 

The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music, which has also been influenced by regional music traditions.<ref name=baulbengalonline>{{cite web

| title = The Bauls of Bengal| accessdate = 2006-10-26| work = Folk Music| publisher = BengalOnline
}}</ref> Other folk music forms include [[Gombhira]] and [[Bhawaiya]]. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], a one-stringed instrument. West Bengal also has an heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]]. From the early 1990s, there has been an emergence and popularisation of [[Indian rock#Rock scenes|new genres]] of music, including fusions of Baul and Jazz by several [[Bangla band]]s, as well as the emergence of what has been called ''Jeebonmukhi Gaan'' (a modern genre based on realism) by artists like [[Kabir Suman]] and bands like [[Chandrabindu (band)|Chandrabindu]]. Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions. [[Chau dance]] of Purulia is a rare form of mask dance.<ref name=chauboloji>{{cite web

Mainstream [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] are popular, as are films from the [[Bengali cinema]] industry, dubbed "Tollywood". [[Tollygunj]] in [[Kolkata]] is the location of Bengali movie studios and the name "Tollywood" (similar as [[Hollywood]], [[USA]])is derived from that name. The Bengali film industry is also known for [[art film]]s. Its long tradition of filmmaking has produced acclaimed [[Film director|directors]] like [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Mrinal Sen]] and [[Ritwik Ghatak]]. Contemporary directors include [[Buddhadev Dasgupta]], [[Goutam Ghose]], [[Aparna Sen]] and [[Rituparno Ghosh]].  

Rice and fish are traditional favorite foods, leading to a saying that in Bengali, ''machhe bhate bangali'', that translates as "fish and rice make a Bengali".<ref name=machhe>{{cite web
