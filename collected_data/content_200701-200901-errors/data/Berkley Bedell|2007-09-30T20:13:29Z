'''Berkley Warren Bedell''' (born [[March 5]], [[1921]]) is a former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Iowa]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Spirit Lake, Iowa]], Bedell was educated in Spirit Lake public schools.
He graduated from Spirit Lake High School, 1939, where he earned spending money with a business in the midst of the Great Depression. His business involved braiding dog hairs around fishhooks, the result of which could be sold as trout flies. He attended [[Iowa State University]], Ames from 1940 to 1942, and he served in the [[United States Army]] as first lieutenant from 1942 to 1945.

When he got back, his fish tackling business took off and he founded Berkley & Company. His business became larger, with hundreds of employees, and he was a millionaire by the 1960s. He served as member of the Spirit Lake Board of Education from 1957 to 1962.

==Political Career==

By the early 1970s, he decided to run for political office. In [[1972]], he ran against [[Wiley Mayne]], a Republican incumbent in [[Iowa's 6th congressional district]]. Mayne was a staunch supporter of [[Richard Nixon]], and rode to victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. However, Mayne would suffer for his support after [[Watergate]]. As one of only 10 Republicans to back the President throughout the scandal, Mayne would suffer politically. In a rematch against Mayne in [[1974]], Bedell was able to win.

During his time at Congress, his supporters claimed that Bedell was someone who took [[representative democracy]] seriously. He would hold town halls regularly with his constituents, and he would let them vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf.

Though known as a timid individual, he sponsored many initiatives during his tenure in the [[House of Representatives]]. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the [[Barge|barge industry]], focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in [[1977]] that would require the [[Barge|barge industry]] to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain.

==After Politics==

Bedell decided not to seek reelection in [[1986]] after contracting [[Lyme Disease]] from a tick bite. Since then, he has founded a center for [[alternative medicine]].
