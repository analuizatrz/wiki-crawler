==Etymology==
Common abbreviations of the United States of America include the ''United States'', the ''U.S.'', and the ''U.S.A.'' Colloquial names for the country include the common ''America'' as well as ''the States''. The term ''Americas'', for the lands of the western hemisphere, was coined in the early sixteenth century after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], an Italian explorer and [[cartographer]]. The full name of the country was first used officially in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which was the "unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America" adopted by the "Representatives of the united States of America" on [[July 4]], [[1776]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/charters_downloads.html | title=The Charters of Freedom | accessdate=2007-06-20 | publisher=National Archives}}</ref> The current name was finalized on [[November 15]], [[1777]], when the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which states, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'" ''[[Historical Columbia|Columbia]]'', a once popular name for the Americas and the U.S., was derived from [[Christopher Columbus]]. It appears in the name ''District of Columbia''. A female personification of Columbia appears on some official documents, including certain prints of U.S. currency.

The standard way to [[demonym|refer to a citizen]] of the United States is as an ''[[American (word)|American]].'' Though ''United States'' is the formal adjective, ''American'' and ''U.S.'' are the most common adjectives used to refer to the country ("American values," "U.S. forces"). ''American'' is rarely used in English to refer to people not connected to the U.S. The prevailing use of ''American'' as synonymous with ''U.S. citizen'' has aroused controversy, particularly in Latin America, where Spanish and Portuguese speakers refer to themselves as "americanos" and use "estadounidense" to describe a person from the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?origen=RAE&LEMA=estadounidense&SUPIND=0&CAREXT=10000&NEDIC=No| title=Estadounidense (definition) | accessdate=2007-06-21 | publisher=Real Academia Española|work= Diccionario de la lengua Española}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the United States|Territorial evolution of the United States}}
[[Image:USA topo en.jpg|thumb|[[Topography|Topographic map]] of the [[continental United States]]]]
The United States is the world's third or fourth [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|largest nation by total area]], before or after the People's Republic of China, depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted. Including only land area, the U.S. is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://education.yahoo.com/reference/factbook/countrycompare/area/3d.html;_ylt=As1XMsN8kgSx746VWazy_s7PecYF| title = World Factbook: Area Country Comparison Table| publisher = Yahoo Education| accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> The [[continental United States]] stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and from Canada to Mexico and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Alaska is the largest state in area. Separated by Canada, it touches the Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Hawaii occupies an [[archipelago]] in the Pacific, southwest of North America. The [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]], the largest and most populous U.S. territory, is in the northeastern Caribbean. [[Deciduous]] vegetation and [[grassland]]s prevail in the eastern U.S., transitioning to [[prairies]], [[taiga|boreal]] forests, and the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the west, and deserts in the southwest. In the northeast, the coasts of the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Atlantic seaboard]] host much of the country's population. With a few exceptions such as the territory of [[Guam]] and the westernmost portions of Alaska, nearly all of the country lies in the western hemisphere.

Beyond the coastal plain, the rolling hills of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] end at the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. West of the Appalachians, the [[Interior Plains]] and [[Great Plains]] are relatively flat, fertile farm land. The [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]-[[Missouri River]], the world's [[List of rivers by length|fourth longest river system]], runs mainly north-south through the heart of the country. The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the continental U.S., reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,270 m) in [[Colorado]].<ref>{{cite web|author =Benner, Susan| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9E0CEFD6113BF937A15756C0A964958260| title = Tackling Colorado's 14,000-Footers| work = New York Times|date =[[1992-05-24]]| accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref> At 20,320 ft (6,194 m), Alaska's [[Mount McKinley]] is the country's tallest peak.

[[Image:USAClimates.PNG|thumb|right|Climate zones of the continental United States]]
Due to the United States' large size and wide range of geographic features, nearly every type of climate is represented. The climate is temperate in most areas, tropical in Hawaii and southern [[Florida]], polar in Alaska, semiarid in the Great Plains west of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]], desert in the Southwest, mediterranean in coastal [[California]], and arid in the [[Great Basin]]. Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the continental United States.<ref name="Science News 1">{{cite web|author=Perkins, Sid| url = http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp| title = Tornado Alley, USA| accessdate = 2006-09-20|date = [[2002-05-11]]| work = Science News}}</ref> However, the predominantly temperate climate, infrequent severe drought in the major [[arable land|arable regions]], and infrequent severe flooding have helped make the nation a world leader in agriculture.{{fact|date=June 2007}}

With habitats ranging from tropical to Arctic, U.S. plant life is very diverse. The country has more than 17,000 identified native species of [[flora]], including 5,000 in California (home to the [[Sequoia|tallest]], the [[Sequoiadendron|most massive]], and the [[Bristlecone pine|oldest]] trees in the world).<ref>{{cite web|author=Morse, Larry E., et al.| url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/j085.htm | title=Native Vascular Plants | publisher = U.S. Dept. of the Interior, National Biological Service|work=Our Living Resources| accessdate=2006-06-14}}</ref> More than 400 mammal, 700 bird, 500 reptile and amphibian, and 90,000 insect species have been documented.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/index.htm | title=Our Living Resources | publisher = U.S. Dept. of the Interior, National Biological Service| accessdate=2006-06-14}}</ref> Wetlands such as the Florida [[Everglades]] are the base for much of this diversity.

In 1872, the world's first [[national park]] was established at Yellowstone.

[[Image:MayflowerHarbor.jpg|left|thumb|''The [[Mayflower]] in Plymouth Harbor,'' by William Halsall, 1882. The ''Mayflower'' transported [[Pilgrims]] to the New World in 1620.]]
Florida was home to the earliest European colonies on the mainland; of these, only [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], founded in 1565, remains.
French fur traders set up small outposts called [[New France]] near the Great Lakes. Later Spanish settlements in the present-day [[southwestern United States]] drew thousands through Mexico. The first successful British settlements were the [[Virginia Colony]] in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 and the [[Pilgrim]]s' [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. The 1628 chartering of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] resulted in a wave of migration; by 1634, [[New England]] had been settled by some 10,000 [[Puritans]]. Between the late 1610s and the revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 convicts to its American colonies.<ref>{{cite web|work=Butler, James Davie|url=http://www.dinsdoc.com/butler-1.htm|title=British Convicts Shipped to American Colonies | publisher = Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History|work=American Historical Review 2|date=Otober 1896| accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Beginning in 1614, the Dutch established settlements along the lower [[Hudson River]], including [[New Amsterdam]] on [[Manhattan Island]]. The small settlement of [[New Sweden]], founded along the [[Delaware River]] in 1638, was taken over by the Dutch in 1655.

In the [[French and Indian War]], the colonial extension of the [[Seven Years War]], Britain seized Canada from the French, but the [[francophone]] population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. By 1674, the British had won the former Dutch colonies in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]; the province of [[New Netherland]] was renamed [[New York]]. With the 1729 division of the [[Carolinas]] and the 1732 colonization of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the thirteen British colonies that would become the United States of America were established. All had active local and colonial governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient [[rights of Englishmen]] and a sense of self government that stimulated support for [[republicanism]]. All had legalized the [[African slave trade]]. With high birth rates, low death rates, and steady immigration, the colonies doubled in population every twenty-five years. The [[Revivalism|revivalist]] movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty. By 1770, the colonies had an increasingly [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] population of three million, approximately half that of Britain itself. Though [[No taxation without representation|subject to British taxation]], they were given no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].

===Independence and expansion===
{{main|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War|Manifest Destiny}}
[[Image:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|''[[Trumbull's Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'', by [[John Trumbull]], 1817–18]]
Tensions between [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonials]] and the British during the [[American Revolution|revolutionary period]] of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the [[American Revolutionary War]], fought from 1775 through 1781. On [[June 14]], [[1775]], the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]], convening in [[Philadelphia]], established an army under the command of [[George Washington]]. The Congress adopted the [[Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]], on [[July 4]], [[1776]]. The Congress, lacking authority to levy taxes, had difficulty funding the [[Continental Army]]. It overprinted [[Banknote|paper money]], triggering [[hyperinflation]]. In 1777, the Congress adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], uniting the states under a weak federal government, which operated until 1788. Some 70,000–80,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]]s to the British Crown fled the rebellious states, many to [[Nova Scotia]] and the new [[Canada under British Imperial control (1764-1867)|British holdings in Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learnquebec.ca/export/sites/learn/en/content/curriculum/social_sciences/documents/loyalistoverview.pdf|title=The United Empire Loyalists—An Overview | publisher = Learn Quebec | accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Native Americans, with divided loyalties, fought on both sides of [[Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|the war's western front]].
[[Image:US states by date of statehood3.gif|thumb|left|U.S. growth by date of [[state]]hood and [[ratification]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]]]
After the British army's defeat by American forces, who were assisted by the French, Great Britain recognized the sovereignty of the thirteen states in 1783. A constitutional convention was organized in 1787 by those who wished to establish a strong national government with power over the states. By June 1788, nine states had ratified the [[United States Constitution]], sufficient to establish the new government; the republic's first [[United States Senate|Senate]], [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and [[President of the United States|president]], George Washington, took office in 1789. [[New York City]] was the federal capital for a year, before the government relocated to Philadelphia. In 1791, the states ratified the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], ten amendments to the Constitution forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections. Attitudes toward [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] were shifting; a [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|clause in the Constitution]] protected the African slave trade only until 1808. The Northern states abolished slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the [[slave states]] of the South as defenders of the "[[peculiar institution]]." In 1800, the federal government moved to the newly founded [[History of Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] The [[Second Great Awakening]] made [[evangelicalism]] a force behind various social [[reform movement]]s.
[[Image:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|right|thumb|Territorial acquisitions by date]]
Americans' eagerness to [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|expand westward]] began a cycle of [[Indian Wars]] that stretched to the end of the nineteenth century, as Native Americans were stripped of their land. The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of French-claimed territory under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 virtually doubled the nation's size. The [[War of 1812]], declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened American [[nationalism]]. A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led [[Spanish Cession|Spain to cede]] it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The country annexed the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1845. The concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] was popularized during this time.<ref>Morrison, Michael A. (1999). ''Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 13–21. ISBN 0807847968.</ref> The 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]]. The U.S. victory in the [[Mexican-American War]] resulted in the 1848 [[Mexican Cession|cession]] of California and much of the present-day [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. The [[California Gold Rush]] of 1848–1849 further spurred western migration. [[Rail transport in the United States#History|New railways]] made relocation much less arduous for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million [[American bison]], commonly called buffalo, were slaughtered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the bison, a primary economic resource for the [[plains Indians]], was an existential blow to many native cultures.

===Civil War and industrialization===

[[Image:Battle of Gettysburg, by Currier and Ives.png|thumb|left|''[[Battle of Gettysburg]]'', lithograph by [[Currier & Ives]], ca. 1863]]
[[Origins of the American Civil War|Tensions]] between slave and [[Free state (USA)|free state]]s mounted with increasing disagreements over the relationship between the [[states' rights|state and federal governments]] and [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflicts]] over the expansion of slavery into new states. [[Abraham Lincoln]], candidate of the largely antislavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was elected president in 1860. Before he took office, seven slave states declared their [[secession]] from the U.S., forming the [[Confederate States of America]]. The federal government maintained secession was illegal, and with the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack upon Fort Sumter]], the [[American Civil War]] began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Emancipation Proclamation|freed Confederate slaves]] as its [[Union Army|army]] advanced through the South. Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|ensured freedom for the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves]],<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860a-02.pdf | title = 1860 Census | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate = 2007-06-10 }} Page 7 lists a total slave population of 3,953,760.</ref> [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|made them citizens]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|gave them voting rights]].

[[Image:Ellis island 1902.jpg|thumb|Immigrants landing at [[Ellis Island]], [[New York City|New York]], 1902]]
After the war, the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of President Lincoln]] [[Radical Republican|radicalized Republican]] [[Reconstruction]] policies aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves. The disputed [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 presidential election]] resolved by the [[Compromise of 1877]] ended Reconstruction; [[Jim Crow laws]] soon [[Disfranchisement after the Civil War|disenfranchised many African Americans]]. In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented [[Immigration to the United States#Immigration 1850 to 1930|influx of immigrants]] hastened the [[United States technological and industrial history#Technological systems and infrastructure|country's industrialization]]. The wave of immigration, which lasted until 1929, provided labor for American industry and transformed American culture. High tariff protections, national infrastructure building, and national banking regulations encouraged industrial growth. The 1867 [[Alaska purchase]] from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The [[Wounded Knee massacre]] in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the Indian Wars. In 1893, the [[Ancient Hawaii|indigenous monarchy]] of the Pacific [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was overthrown in a coup led by American residents; the archipelago was annexed by the U.S. in 1898. Victory in the [[Spanish-American War]] that same year demonstrated that the United States was a [[Great power|major world power]] and resulted in the annexation of Puerto Rico and the [[Philippines]].<ref>Spielvogel, Jackson J. (2005). ''Western Civilization: Volume II: Since 1500''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, p. 708.

[[Image:Dust Bowl - Dallas, South Dakota 1936.jpg|thumb|left|An abandoned farm in South Dakota during the [[Dust Bowl]], 1936]]
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the United States remained neutral.  Americans sympathized with the British and French, although many citizens, mostly Irish and German, opposed intervention.<ref>Foner, Eric, and John A. Garraty (1991).

In part due to the service of many in the war, Native Americans gained [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizenship]] in the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]]. 

During [[Roaring Twenties|most of the 1920s]], the United States enjoyed a period of unbalanced prosperity as farm profits fell while industrial profits grew. A rise in debt and an inflated [[stock market]] culminated in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 crash]] that triggered the [[Great Depression]]. After his election as president in 1932, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] responded with the [[New Deal]], a range of policies increasing government intervention in the economy. The [[Dust Bowl]] of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration. The nation would not fully recover from the economic depression until the industrial mobilization spurred by its entrance into [[World War II]], which began when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded [[Poland]] on [[September 1]], [[1939]]. The United States, effectively neutral during the war's early stages, began supplying [[materiel]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in March 1941 through the [[Lend-Lease]] program.

On [[December 7]], [[1941]], the United States joined the Allies against the [[Axis Powers]] after a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by Japan.

[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivering his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, 1963]]
The United States and Soviet Union jockeyed for power after World War II during the [[Cold War]], dominating the military affairs of Europe through the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States promoted [[liberal democracy]] and [[capitalism]], while the Soviet Union promoted [[communism]] and a centrally [[planned economy]], but both sides supported dictatorships and engaged in [[proxy war]]s, including the [[Greek Civil War]] and the [[Korean War]]. As the [[Communist Party]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] suppressed dissent, American [[anti-communist]]s like [[Joseph McCarthy]] attempted and failed to suppress their opposition at home.

The Soviet Union launched the first manned spacecraft in 1961, prompting U.S. efforts to raise proficiency in mathematics and science and President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for the country to be first to land "a man on the moon," achieved in 1969.<ref>Rudolph, John L.  (2002). ''Scientists in the Classroom: The Cold War Reconstruction of American Science Education''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 1. ISBN 0312295715.</ref> Kennedy also faced a [[Cuban Missile Crisis|tense nuclear showdown]] with Soviet forces in Cuba. Meanwhile, America experienced sustained economic expansion. A growing [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] headed by prominent African Americans, such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], fought segregation and discrimination, leading to the abolition of [[Jim Crow laws]] and passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>Klarman, Michael J.

Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]] in 1963, his successors expanded a proxy war in Southeast Asia into the unsuccessful [[Vietnam War]]. As a result of the [[Watergate scandal]], in 1974 [[Richard Nixon]] became the first U.S. president to [[resign]], rather than be [[impeachment|impeached]] on charges including [[obstruction of justice]] and [[abuse of power]].

The election of [[Ronald Reagan]] as president in 1980 marked a significant [[Conservatism in the United States#Nixon, Reagan, and Bush|rightward shift in American politics]]. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Soviet Union's power diminished]], leading to its collapse. The leadership role taken by the United States and its allies in the United Nations–sanctioned [[Gulf War]] and the [[Yugoslav wars]] helped to preserve its position as the world's last remaining superpower and to expand NATO. [[September 11, 2001 attacks|On September 11, 2001]], terrorists struck the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[The Pentagon]] near Washington, D.C., killing nearly three thousand people. In the aftermath, President [[George W. Bush]] launched the [[War on Terrorism]] under a military philosophy stressing [[preemptive war]] now known as the [[Bush Doctrine]]. In late 2001, U.S. forces led a NATO [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]], removing the [[Taliban]] government and [[al-Qaeda]] terrorist training camps. As of 2007, a Taliban insurgency continues to fight a guerrilla war against the NATO occupation force.

In his 2002 [[State of the Union]] address, President Bush labeled [[North Korea]], [[Iraq]], and [[Iran]] the "[[axis of evil]]," and stated that these countries "constitute a grave threat to the security of the U.S. and its allies."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020129-11.html |title=2002 Presidential State of the Union |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=2007-06-07 |date=[[2002-01-29]]}}</ref> Later that year, the Bush administration pressed for [[regime change]] in Iraq [[Rationale for the Iraq War|on controversial grounds]].

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Federal government of the United States|Politics of the United States}}
[[Image:USCapitol.jpg|thumb|right|The west front of the [[United States Capitol]], which houses the [[United States Congress]]]]
The United States is the world's oldest surviving [[federation]]. It is both a [[representative democracy]] and a [[constitutional republic]], "in which [[majority rule]] is tempered by [[minority rights]] protected by law."<ref>Scheb, John M., and John M. Scheb II (2002). ''An Introduction to the American Legal System''. Florence, KY: Delmar, p. 6. ISBN 0766827593.</ref> The government is regulated by a system of [[checks and balances]] defined by the [[United States Constitution]], which serves as the supreme legal document in the American system and as a [[social contract]] for the people of the United States. Citizens are usually subject to three levels of government, federal, state, and local; the [[local government]]'s duties may themselves be split among county, metropolitan, and municipal governments. Officials at all levels are either elected by voters in a [[secret ballot]] or appointed by other elected officials. Executive and legislative offices are decided by a [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]] of citizens by district. Federal and state judicial and [[cabinet]] officials are typically nominated by the executive branch and approved by the legislature, although some state judges are elected by popular vote.

[[Image:HobanNorthPortico.jpg|thumb|left|The north side of the [[White House]], home and work place of the U.S. president]]
The federal government is comprised of three branches:
* [[legislature|Legislative]]: The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], made up of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] makes [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]], and has the rarely used power of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove sitting members of the government. 

* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of the United States|president]] is the [[Commander-in-Chief|commander-in-chief]] of the military, can veto bills, and appoints the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.

* [[Judiciary]]: The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and lower [[United States federal courts|federal court]]s, whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[unconstitutional]].

The House of Representatives has 435 members, each representing a [[congressional district]] for a two-year term. House seats are [[United States Congressional apportionment|apportioned]] among the fifty states by population every tenth year. As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], seven states have the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, has fifty-three. Each state has two senators, elected [[at-large]] to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every second year. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office [[Term limits in the United States|no more than twice]]. The Supreme Court, led by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], has nine members, who serve for life.
[[Image:Supreme Court Front Dusk.jpg|thumb|right|The front of the [[United States Supreme Court building]]]]
All laws and procedures of both state and federal governments are subject to review, and any law ruled in violation of the Constitution by the judicial branch is overturned. The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government, the relationship between it and the individual states, and essential matters of military and economic authority. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] protects the right to the "great writ" of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] guarantees the [[Jury trial#The United States|right to a jury trial]] in all criminal cases. [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Amendments to the Constitution]] require the approval of three-fourths of the states. The Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times, including the 1791 [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] guarantees [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of the press|the press]], and [[freedom of assembly|peaceable assembly]], and the [[freedom to petition|right to petition the government]]. The other nine amendments of the Bill establish such rights as [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|the right to keep and bear arms]]; [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|protection from unreasonable search and seizure]]; [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the right to due process and just compensation for seized property and protection against double jeopardy and self-incrimination]]; [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the right to a speedy trial, impartial jury, and legal counsel]]; and [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|protection against cruel and unusual punishment]]. Of the later amendments, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] is regarded as particularly important; it obliges each individual state to protect the rights of every citizen to [[Due Process Clause|due process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] under the law. The extent to which Americans' constitutional rights are universally upheld in practice is heavily debated. 

The overwhelming majority of elected offices across the country at federal, state, and lower levels are held by the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]] or the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]]. The Senate has two [[Independent (politician)|independent]] members—one is a former Democratic incumbent, the other is a self-described [[socialist]]; every member of the House is a Democrat or Republican. Within American [[political culture]], the Republican Party is considered "center-right" or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and the Democratic Party is considered "center-left" or [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]], but members of both parties have a wide range of views.  In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential election of 2000]], the Democratic candidate, incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] [[Al Gore]], received a larger share of the popular vote than the Republican candidate, Texas [[Governor#United States|governor]] [[George W. Bush]]. The president is not elected by direct vote, however, but by an indirect [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] system in which the determining votes are apportioned by state. The [[United States presidential election, 2000 Florida results|disputed vote count in Florida]] left the election unresolved for over a month until a [[Bush v. Gore|Supreme Court decision]] effectively awarded the presidency to Bush.  [[United States presidential election, 2004|In 2004, Bush won reelection]] over Democratic challenger Senator [[John Kerry]]. Following the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party holds a majority of seats in both the House and Senate for the first time since the election of 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/one_item_and_teasers/partydiv.htm |title=Party Division in the Senate, 1789—Present |publisher=U.S. Senate |date=2007}} {{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/house_history/partyDiv.html |title=Party Divisions of the House of Representatives (1789 to Present) |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives, Office of the Clerk |date=2007|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> In a March 2007 poll, 41 percent of Americans described themselves as "conservative," 34 percent as "moderate," and 21 percent as "liberal."<ref>{{cite web|author=Joyner, James |url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2007/03/twice_as_many_americans_conservative_over_liberal/ |title=Twice as Many Americans Conservative as Liberal |publisher=Outside the Beltway |date=[[2007-03-11]]|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> The West Coast and New England states are relatively liberal-leaning—they are known in political parlance as "[[Red states and blue states|blue states]]."

The United States has vast economic, political, and military influence on a global scale, which makes its foreign policy a subject of great interest  around the world. Almost all countries have [[List of Washington, D.C. embassies|embassies]] in Washington, D.C., and many host [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] around the country.  Likewise, nearly all nations host [[American diplomatic missions]]. However, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, [[Bhutan]], and [[Sudan]] do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/INS/e0304/results.htm |title=Table 2: Aliens From Countries That Sponsor Terrorism Who Were Ordered Removed—1 October 2000 through 31 December 2001 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Justice |date=February 2003|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> 

American isolationists have often been at odds with internationalists, as American anti-imperialists have been with promoters of Manifest Destiny and [[American Empire]]. American [[Philippine-American War|imperialism in the Philippines]] drew sharp rebukes from [[Mark Twain]] and many others. Later, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] played a key role in creating the League of Nations, but the Senate prohibited American membership in it. Isolationism became a thing of the past when the United States took a lead role in founding the United Nations, becoming a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and host to the [[United Nations headquarters]]. The U.S. enjoys a [[special relationship]] with Britain and strong ties with Australia, Japan, Israel, and fellow NATO members. It also works closely with its neighbors through the [[Organization of American States]] and [[free trade agreement]]s such as the trilateral [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with Canada and Mexico. In 2005, the U.S. spent $27.3 billion on [[official development assistance]], the most in the world; however, as a share of [[gross national income]] (GNI), the U.S. contribution of 0.22 percent ranked twentieth of twenty-two donor states. On the other hand, nongovernmental sources such as private foundations, corporations, and educational and religious institutions donated $95.5 billion. The total of $122.8 billion is again the most in the world and seventh in terms of GNI percentage.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Americans Favor Private Giving, People-to-People Contacts|date=[[2007-05-24]]|publisher=U.S. Dept. of State, International Information Programs|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2007&m=May&x=20070524165115zjsredna0.2997553|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

The Department of Defense also employs approximately 700,000 civilians, disregarding contractors. Military service is voluntary, though [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] may occur in wartime through the [[Selective Service System]]. The rapid deployment of American forces is ensured in part by the Air Force's large fleet of transportation aircraft and aerial refueling tankers, the Navy's fleet of eleven active aircraft carriers, and [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s at sea in the Navy's [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic and]] [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]].

In 1878, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion. In 1894, the world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City, using [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]]. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the U.S. was in the forefront of [[sound film]]'s development in the following decades. Since the early twentieth century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around [[Hollywood, California]]. The [[major film studio]]s of Hollywood are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies in the world, such as ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997). American screen actors like [[John Wayne]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] have become iconic figures, while producer/entrepreneur [[Walt Disney]] was a leader in both [[animated film]] and movie [[merchandising]]. Director [[D. W.

The [[rhythm]]ic and [[lyrics|lyrical]] styles of [[African American music]] have deeply influenced [[Music of the United States|American music]] at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from [[Folk music|folk]] idioms such as the [[blues]] and what is now known as [[old-time music]] were adopted and transformed into [[popular music|popular genres]] with global audiences.

[[Country music]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock and roll]] emerged between the 1920s and 1950s. More recent American creations include [[funk]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. American pop stars such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Madonna]] have become global celebrities.

===Literature and the arts===
{{main|Literature of the United States|Visual arts of the United States|Theater in the United States}}
[[Image:Mountrushmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Rushmore]], a massive sculpture of four prominent American presidents]]
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]] established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the nineteenth century. [[Mark Twain]] and poet [[Walt Whitman]] were major figures in the century's second half; [[Emily Dickinson]], virtually unknown during her lifetime, would be recognized as America's other essential poet. Eleven U.S. citizens have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], most recently [[Toni Morrison]] in 1993. [[Ernest Hemingway]], the 1954 Nobel laureate, is often named as one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century.<ref>Meyers, Jeffrey (1999). ''Hemingway: A Biography''. New York: Da Capo, p. 139. ISBN 0306808900.</ref> A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), Twain's ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1885), and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925)—may be dubbed the "[[great American novel]]." Popular literary genres such as the [[Western literature|Western]] and [[hardboiled|hardboiled crime fiction]] developed in the United States.

The other classical arts did not establish distinctive American expressions until the twentieth century. In the visual arts, the [[Hudson River School]] was an important mid-nineteenth-century movement in the tradition of European [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]]. The 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York City, an exhibition of European [[Modern art|modernist art]], shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.<ref>Brown, Milton W. (1988 [1963]). ''The Story of the Armory Show''. New York: Abbeville. ISBN 0896597954.</ref> [[Georgia O'Keefe]], [[Marsden Hartley]], and others experimented with new styles, displaying a highly individualistic sensibility. Major artistic movements such as the [[abstract expressionism]] of [[Jackson Pollack]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] and the [[pop art]] of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] have developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then [[post-modernism]] has also brought American architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Frank Gehry]] to the top of their field.

One of the first notable promoters of the nascent American theater was impresario [[P. T. Barnum]], who began operating a lower [[Manhattan]] entertainment complex in 1841. The team of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]] produced a series of popular [[musical theatre|musical]] comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the twentieth century, the modern musical form emerged on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where the songs of composers such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]] have become [[Traditional pop music|pop standards]]. Playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Edward Albee]], and [[August Wilson]].

Though largely overlooked at the time, [[Charles Ives]]'s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition; other experimentalists such as [[Henry Cowell]] and [[John Cage]] created an identifiably American approach to classical composition. [[Aaron Copeland]] and [[George Gershwin]] developed a unique American synthesis of popular and classical music. [[Choreographer]]s [[George Balanchine]], [[Jerome Robbins]], and [[Martha Graham]] were among the leading figures of twentieth-century dance. The U.S. has long been at the fore in the relatively modern artistic medium of [[photography]], with major practitioners such as [[Alfred Steiglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Ansel Adams]], and many others. The newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[comic book]] are both American innovations.

Mainstream [[Cuisine of the United States|American culinary arts]] are similar to those in other Western countries. [[Wheat]] is the primary [[cereal]] grain. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[potatoes]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]], [[squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[maple syrup]], indigenous foods employed by Native Americans and early European settlers. Slow-cooked pork and beef [[barbecue]], [[crab cake]]s, and [[chocolate chip cookie]]s are distinctively American styles. [[Soul food]], developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana creole]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], and [[Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]] are regionally important. [[Fried chicken]], which combines Scottish and African American culinary traditions, is a national favorite. Iconic American dishes such as [[apple pie]], [[pizza]], and [[hamburger]]s derive from the recipes of various European immigrants.

Apart from professional business attire, U.S. fashions are eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, [[cowboy hat]]s and [[cowboy boot|boots]] and leather [[rocker jacket|motorcycle jacket]]s are emblematic of specifically American styles. [[Jeans|Blue jeans]] were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s by merchant [[Levi Strauss]], a German immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are now widely worn on every continent by people of all ages and social classes. Along with mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably U.S. culture's primary contribution to global fashion.<ref>{{cite book | author = Davis, Fred | year = 1992 | title = Fashion, Culture, and Indentity| publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago |pages = p. 69| id = ISBN 0226138097 }}</ref> The country is also home to the headquarters of many leading [[designer label]]s such as [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Eddie Bauer]], and [[Calvin Klein]]. Labels such as [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] and [[Eckō]] cater to various [[niche market]]s.

[[Image:2006 Pro Bowl tackle.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pro Bowl]] (2006), [[American football]]'s annual [[all-star game]]]]
Since the late nineteenth century, [[baseball]] has been regarded as the [[National sport|national pastime]]; [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], and [[ice hockey]] are the country's three other leading professional team sports. [[College football]] and [[College basketball|basketball]] also attract large audiences. Football is now by some measures the most popular [[spectator sport]] in the United States.<ref>Maccambridge, Michael (2004). ''America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation''. New York: Random House. ISBN 0375504540.</ref> [[Boxing]] and [[horse racing]] were once the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed by [[golf]] and [[auto racing]], particularly [[NASCAR]]. [[Soccer]], though not a leading professional sport in the country, is participated in widely at the youth and amateur levels. [[Tennis]] and many outdoor sports are also popular. While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball was invented in 1891 by Dr. [[James Naismith]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and the regionally popular [[lacrosse]] was a precolonial Native American sport. At the individual level, [[skateboarding]] and [[snowboarding]] are twentieth-century U.S. inventions, related to [[surfing]], a Hawaiian practice predating Western contact. Eight [[Olympic Games]] have [[United States at the Olympics|taken place in the United States]], four Summer games and four Winter games. The United States has won 2,191 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], more than any other country,<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Medal Standings, 1896–2004 | publisher = Information Please|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0115108.html | accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> and the second most in the [[Winter Olympic Games]], with 216 medals.<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Medal Standings, 1924–2006 | publisher = Information Please|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0115207.html | accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> Several American athletes have become world famous, in particular baseball player [[Babe Ruth]], boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]].
