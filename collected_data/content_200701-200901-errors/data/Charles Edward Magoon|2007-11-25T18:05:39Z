'''Charles Edward Magoon''' ([[December 5]] [[1861]] – [[January 14]] [[1920]]) was a prominent [[United States]] [[lawyer]], [[judge]], [[diplomat]], and colonial administrator who is best remembered as a colonial [[Governor]] of both the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and [[Cuba]]. He was also the subject of several small scandals during his career.

As a legal adviser working for the [[United States Department of War]], he drafted recommendations and reports the were used by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the executive branch in governing the United States' new territories following the [[Spanish-American War]]. These reports were collected as a published book in 1902, then considered the seminal work on the subject.<ref name="mytimes_1920_1">{{cite news |title = C.E.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Magoon was born in Owatonna, [[Steele County, Minnesota|Steele County]], [[Minnesota]]. His family moved with him to [[Nebraska]] when he was still a child. In 1876, he enrolled in the "prep" program at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska at Lincoln]] and studied there for two years before officially enrolling in 1878. He left school in 1879 to study [[law]] independently with a prominent law firm. In 1882, he was admitted into the [[bar (law)|bar]] and practiced law in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]].<ref name="UNC">{{citeweb|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/htm/03922.html|title=Charles Edward Magoon Papers Inventory (#3922-z)|publisher=Wilson Library University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> Eventually, he was made a partner in the firm.<ref name="washpost_1">{{cite news |title = Magoon Has Won His Spurs|work = [[The Washington Post]] |pages = 8 |date = [[1904-08-21]]}}</ref> He also became the [[judge advocate]] of the [[Nebraska National Guard]] and continued to use the title of "Judge" throughout the remainder of his career.<ref name="mytimes_1920_1" />

===War Department and the "Magoon Incident"===
By 1899, Magoon was sought out to join the law office of the newly created Division of Customs and Insular Affairs, later renamed the [[Bureau of Insular Affairs]], in the U.S. Department of War under [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Russell A. Alger]]. At this time, legal and political controversy had arisen regarding whether the people of the United States' newly acquired territories were automatically granted the same rights under the [[United States Constitution]] as Americans in the continental United States. Under Alger, Magoon prepared a report in May 1899 that would have established the official departmental legal policy as "the Constitution follows the flag".

Under this view, the residents of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and other territories became subject to all the rights and responsibilities granted by the Constitution at the moment the treaty transferring the territories to U.S. sovereignty was signed. For the new territories following the Spanish-American War, this would have been from the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] on [[December 10]] [[1898]]. With the resignation of Secretary Alger, this incomplete report was not released to Congress.<ref name="chicagotrib_1">{{cite news |title = Problem of War Tax|work = [[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]] |pages = 7 |date = [[1900-04-02]]}}</ref>

In August 1899, [[Elihu Root]] became the new Secretary of War and the unreleased report was scrapped. Instead, Magoon drafted a new report which came to precisely the opposite conclusion from the first: that the Constitution did not apply in new territories until the United States Congress specifically passed legislation to make it so in each new possession. It argued that precedent was set when Congress passed legislation to apply the Constitution to the [[Northwest Territory]] and the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. This revised report was dated [[February 12]] [[1900]], and released to Congress as a policy document expressing the Department's official stance on the issue.<ref name="forum_1">{{cite news |title = The Constitution and the Flag|work = Forum |pages = 257–263 |date = May 1900}}</ref> This view was largely adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] beginning in 1901 in the so-called "[[Insular Cases]]."

During this period, Congress was debating a Puerto Rico Tariff Act that would have been unconstitutional had the first definition been kept. This was a largely partisan issue at the time - the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were in favor of this Act, but it was strongly denounced by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. During the ensuing debate, the existence of the original report was discovered by the Democrats who requested that the War Department release the earlier report to them, so they could be compared "side by side". The request was refused, but a copy of the report was leaked, allowing [[Minority Leader]] [[James D. Richardson]] to read it aloud on the [[United States Senate|Senate]] floor, prior to the vote. These efforts failed; the vote remained along party lines and the measure was passed.<ref name="latimes_1">{{cite news |title = Puerto Rico Brought Close|work = [[Los Angeles Times]]|pages = I1-I2 |date = [[1900-04-12]]}}</ref>

This small scandal, with Magoon at the center, was termed the "Magoon Incident" by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and resulted in harsh words against him from both parties. Fellow Republicans urged that Magoon was only a "subordinate clerk", with no right to express any opinion except the opinion of the department, and therefore the first report should hold no weight.<ref name="chicagotrib_2">{{cite news |title = Porto Rican Bill Passed By House|work = Chicago Daily Tribune|pages = 1–2 |date = [[1900-04-12]]}}</ref> Democrats similarly were against the second version of the report. It is unclear which version, if any, actually represented Magoon's personal views rather than the views of the current Secretary of War.

After this incident, Magoon remained with the Department of War. In 1902, his work on the legal foundations of the new civil governments was released to the public as a book, ''Reports on The Law of Civil Government in Territory Subject to Military Occupation by the Military Forces of the United States, etc.'' It was reprinted several times and was considered the seminal text on the subject.<ref name="chicagotrib_3">{{cite news |title = Civil Government By the Military|work = Chicago Daily Tribune|pages = 1–2 |date = [[1902-07-14]]}}</ref>

===Panama===
In late 1903, Secretary Root announced that he was retiring as Secretary of War. Speculation followed in the media that Magoon would retire simultaneously and join the outgoing Secretary in private practice.<ref name="washpost_3">{{cite news |title = Judge Magoon's Success|work = The Washington Post|page = 6 |date = [[1903-08-19]]}}</ref> Instead, Magoon was appointed by President Roosevelt in June 1904 to be the [[general counsel]] for the [[Isthmian Canal Commission]], the group working toward what would eventually become the [[Panama Canal]]. In this role, he would be working under Chairman [[John G. Walker]], but would not be a Commissioner.<ref name="washpost_4">{{cite news |title = Hon. Charles E. Magoon|work = The Washington Post|page = 6 |date = [[1904-06-28]]}}</ref> According to President Roosevelt, Magoon deserved the position because he had "won his spurs" working in the War Department and was well-respected.<ref name="washpost_1" /> Although Magoon was working for the Canal project, his office and residence remained in Washington, DC.

On [[March 29]] [[1905]], President Roosevelt unexpectedly called for the simultaneous resignations of all members of the Canal Commission and the Governor of the Panama Canal Zone, [[George Whitefield Davis]].<ref name="washpost_5">{{cite news |title = Requested to Resign|work = The Washington Post|page = 4 |date = [[1905-03-30]]}}</ref> According to Secretary [[William Howard Taft]], this clean sweep was due to the "inherent clumsiness" of the Commission, especially as related to [[sanitary]] problems in the Zone, as well as the difficulty of reaching consensus between the current seven commissioners.<ref name="medical">{{cite news |title = The Rainbow on the Isthmus|work = Medical News|pages = 745–746 |date = [[1905-04-22]]}}</ref> Several days later, replacement appointments were announced: Magoon was appointed both as Governor and as a member of the Commission, with [[railroad]]-entrepreneur [[Theodore P. Shonts]] made Chairman of the Commission.<ref name="washpost_6">{{cite news |title = Shonts Canal Chief|work = The Washington Post|page = 6 |date = [[1905-04-02]]}}</ref> The new Commission had seven Commissioners, as required by the Act of Congress that created the body, but responsibilities were to be split such that only Magoon, Shonts, and the Chief Engineer had any real authority. The remaining four members of the commission were appointed only to fulfil the letter of the law. Congress had already rejected a request by the President to formally make the Commission a three-member body; restructuring the organization was an end-run around that restriction by the President.<ref name="medical" /> In order to assume his new duties, Magoon relocated to the Canal Zone the following month.

====Governor of Panama Canal Zone====
[[Image:CanalZone.gif|Map of the Panama Canal Zone|thumb|right]]
During his tenure as Governor, Magoon's primary responsibilities within the Canal Zone were to improve sanitation and to deal with the all-too-common outbreaks of [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]]. He refused to believe that the diseases were carried by [[mosquitos]] because, he reasoned, the native population would have been more affected. At this time, the nature of human [[acquired immunity]] to diseases was not well-understood. The Chicago Tribune, in an article about conditions in the canal, referred to the notion that yellow fever was carried by mosquitos as "bugaboo".<ref name="bugaboo">{{cite news |title = Yellow Fever Bugaboo On Isthmus May Retard Progress on Canal|work = Chicago Daily Tribune|page = 6 |date = [[1905-06-07]]|author = Richard Weightman}}</ref>

While Governor, he worked with translators in the War Department to publish an English edition of the complete [[Civil Code]] of [[Panama]], which he codified as the law of the Canal Zone on [[May 9]] [[1904]]. This was the first time that the complete civil code of a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country not a US territory had been translated into English. It was significant that he did not make changes to these laws when "importing" them into the legal system of the territory that he governed.<ref name="translated">{{cite news |title = Panama Code Translated|work = The Washington Post|page = 4 |date = [[1905-06-07]]}}</ref>

On [[July 2]] [[1905]], President Roosevelt consolidated power in Panama further by appointing Magoon as [[United States Ambassador to Panama|Minister to Panama]], to replace [[John Barrett (diplomat)|John Barrett]]. This put Magoon in the unique position of being both a Governor of a US territory ''and'' as a diplomat to the country that territory was an [[enclave]] of. During the tenure of Governor Davis, there had been friction between him and Minister Barrett. This double-appointment would ensure that the two roles could not work at cross-purposes. Magoon would draw two salaries in the arrangement, an issue which would come up later to haunt him. With influential posts in both Panama-proper and the Canal Zone, Magoon was an exceptionally powerful man on the Isthmus.<ref name="minister">{{cite news |title = Magoon to Panama|work = Los Angeles Times|page = I3 |date = [[1905-07-03]]}}</ref>

====Friction with Congress====
The President was coming into increased conflict with Congress on the handling of the Zone, including the unusual consolidation of power. In addition to not officially restructuring the Commission, Congress increasingly fought or raised questions about the appointments of replacement commissioners. In November 1905, Panama was visited by [[Poultney Bigelow]], a lecturer and writer for the [[American Geographical Society]], who wrote a scathing report on progress in the Canal Zone - a report that was well-publicized in the States. This report criticized the efficiency of the work being performed as well as the quality of its management. Magoon countered this negative press by stressing that Bigelow had visited the Zone for less than two days, one of which was [[Thanksgiving Day]], and that work was naturally lax on the holiday.<ref name="bigelow">{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1FFD3B5A12738DDDA00A94D9405B868CF1D3 | format = fee | title = Magoon Here, Replies to Poultney Bigelow|work = The New York Times|pages = 1–2 |date = [[1906-01-29]]}}</ref>

In February, Magoon was called to testify before the Senate Committee responsible for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized now for the earlier adoption of Panama's penal system in the Zone. One major point of contention was that it did not allow for [[trial by jury]] for American citizens arrested there. They raised questions as to the quality of the judges in the territory and other issues.<ref name="hang">{{cite news |title = Hang Without a Hearing|work = The Washington Post|page = 2 |date = [[1906-02-10]]}}</ref>

There was no official outcome from these hearings, but Congress subsequently passed a Consular Reform Bill which included a provision that specifically would not allow a diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position.<ref name="self-made">{{cite news |title = Magoon Is a Self-Made Man|work = Los Angeles Times|page = I16 |date = [[1906-10-29]]}}</ref> Rather than remove Magoon from one of his positions, he was named to be Vice Governor-General of the [[Philippines]]. Ultimately, this offer was rescinded before it could take effect and he was instead appointed as the Governor of Cuba.<ref name="Philippines">{{cite news |title = Magoon Gets New Office|work = The Washington Post|page = 7 |date = [[1906-09-18]]}}</ref>

===Cuba===
{{see|Cuba-United States relations}}
In 1906, Cuba was in the midst of a constitutional crisis as a result of a disputed election and an attempt by elected President, [[Tomás Estrada Palma]], to stay in power after the conclusion of his term. This led to a revolt and the [[United States Military|US military]] sent in 5,600 men to reassert control over the country.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://sshl.ucsd.edu/collections/las/cuba/1902.html|title=Cuba: Elections and Events 1902–1911|publisher=University of California|author=Latin American Election Statistics|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> This was permitted under the [[Platt amendment]] of 1901, a bill stipulating the degree of U.S. intervention in Cuba, which was negotiated with the Cubans during the U.S. occupation of 1899–1902. After a brief period of stabilization by Secretary Taft, Magoon was appointed as Governor under the Constitution of Cuba, effectively with absolute authority and backed by the U.S. military.<ref name="Cuba">{{cite news |title = The Situation in Cuba|work = The Independent|pages = 840–841 |date = [[1906-10-11]]}}</ref>

On [[October 13]] [[1906]], Magoon officially became Cuban governor. Magoon declined to have an official inauguration ceremony, and instead, news of the appointment was announced to the Cuban public via the newspapers. In his written appointment address to the country, Magoon indicated that he would "perform the duties provided for by the&nbsp;... constitution of Cuba for the preservation of Cuban independence". He was there, in short, to restore order and not to colonize.<ref name="cuba2">{{cite news |title = Magoon Takes Taft's Place|work = Los Angeles Times|page = V20 |date = [[1906-10-14]]}}</ref>

[[Image:USSMaine.jpg|Wreckage of the USS ''Maine''|thumb|left]]During Magoon's time as Governor, the remaining revolutionaries were defeated and his attention was turned inward to infrastructure. He coordinated the construction of two hundred kilometers of highway.<ref name="cuba3">{{cite news |title = Magoon's Good Work|work = The Washington Post|page = E4 |date = [[1906-11-03]]}}</ref> He called for the reorganization of the Cuban military into a formal army, rather than a [[Mexico|Mexican]]-style "rural guard".<ref name="cuba4">{{cite news |title = Cuba Will Have Army|work = The Washington Post|page = 1 |date = [[1908-05-05]]|author = John Callan O'Laughlin}}</ref> More controversially, he called for the removal of the sunken [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']], the ship whose destruction led to the Spanish-American War, because it was interfering with traffic in [[Havana]]'s harbor. In his yearly report to the Secretary of War, Magoon reported that many Cubans held the popular belief that neither the United States, nor the US-backed Cuban government, had explored the wreckage because evidence might be found to suggest that the ship was not sunk by a [[torpedo]], as was the official report&mdash;something that would cast doubt on the justification for the United States' war against Spain. The removal of the ship would not happen while Magoon was in office; it was to be authorized by Congress in 1910.<ref name="Maine">{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70611FC3B5512738DDDAC0A94D9405B898CF1D3 | format = fee | title = Magoon Says Raise Wreck of Maine|work = The New York Times|page = 5 |date = [[1909-01-25]]}}</ref>

While he was well-regarded in the United States, Magoon was not popular amongst Cubans. He reaped a vast number of lurid accusations at the hands of Cuban writers who described him as a "man of wax", who was "gross in character, rude in manners, of a profound ambition and greedy for despoilment". The Cuban scholar, Carlos Manuel Trelles, later wrote that Magoon "profoundly corrupted the Cuban nation, and on account of his venality was looked upon with contempt." Other Cuban historians point to the fiscal wastfulness of Magoon's tenure, which "left a bad memory and a bad example to the country" and returned Cuba to the corrupt practices of colonial times.<ref name="Thomas">{{cite book |last= Thomas |first= Hugh |title= Cuba; the Pursuit of Freedom |year= 1971 | publisher=Harper & Row |location=New York|month= March |isbn= 0060142596 | authorlink=Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton| pages=pp. 283–287 | oclc = 16434031 }}</ref>

On [[January 29]] [[1909]], the fully sovereign government of Cuba was restored and [[José Miguel Gómez]] became President. No explicit evidence of Magoon's corruption ever surfaced, but his parting gesture of issuing lucrative Cuban contracts to US firms was a continued point of contention.<ref name="Thomas"/> Several months later, Magoon received an official commendation from President Taft for his excellent service in Cuba.<ref name="commendation">{{cite news |title = Taft Praises Magoon|work = The Washington Post|page = 12 |date = [[1909-06-06]]}}</ref>

Following his service in Cuba, Magoon retired from public service and vacationed for a year in Europe before returning to the United States. Speculation at the time pointed to him taking up a position as Ambassador to China, or on a special commission on stability in Central America, or a Cabinet position. Ultimately, Magoon did not take up any of those new responsibilities and formally entered retirement. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1920 after complications from surgery for acute appendicitis.<ref name="mytimes_1920_1" />
