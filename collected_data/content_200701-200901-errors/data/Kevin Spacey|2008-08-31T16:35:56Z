==Biography==
===Early life===
Spacey was born in [[South Orange, New Jersey]], the son of Kathleen A. Spacey (1931-2003), a [[secretary]], and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler (1924-1992), a [[technical writer]].<ref name="name">{{cite news | author=Paul Fischer | title=The Alien World Of Kevin Spacey | work=FilmMonthly | url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html | date=2001-10-20 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070124110051/http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html | archivedate=2007-01-24| accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> He has two older siblings: a sister, Julie, and a brother, Randy. 

Spacey attended [[Northridge]] [[Military Academy]] from which he was expelled, [[Canoga Park High School]] (in tenth and eleventh grades), and then [[Chatsworth High School]] in [[Chatsworth, California]], where he graduated [[valedictorian]] of his class.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | title=Kevin Spacey | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/710901/Kevin-Spacey | year=2008 | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica online | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=13 Famous Valedictorians | url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/departments/college/?article=FamousValedictorians | work=MSN Encarta | date=2008 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> At Chatsworth High, he starred in the school's senior production of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', playing the part of Captain Georg von Trapp, opposite [[Mare Winningham]]'s character, Maria. While in high school, he took his mother's maiden name, "Spacey", originally a [[Wales|Welsh]] name, belonging to his great-great-grandfather (spelled "Spacy"), as his acting surname.<ref name="soroff">{{cite news | author=Jonathan Soroff | title=Soroff/On Kevin Spacey | url=http://www.drivingmrspacey.com/TheImproperBostonian.htm | work=The Improper Bostonian | date=2007 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> Several reports have incorrectly suggested that he took the name in tribute to actor [[Spencer Tracy]], combining Tracy's first and last names.<ref name="soroff" />

Spacey had tried to succeed as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] for several years, before attending the [[Juilliard School]] in [[New York City]], where he studied drama, between 1979 and 1981. During this time period, Spacey performed stand-up comedy in [[bowling]] alley talent contests.<ref name="abc">{{cite interview | subject=Kevin Spacey | interviewer=Andrew Denton | url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1679270.htm | format=video | program=''Enough rope'' | callsign=ABC  | date=10 July 2006 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

===Career===
Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear-carrier in a [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] performance of ''[[Henry VI, part 1]]'' in 1981. The following year he made his first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] appearance as Oswald in a production of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', starring [[Liv Ullmann]]. Then he portrayed Philinte in [[Moliere]]'s ''The Misanthrope''. In 1984, it was [[David Rabe]]'s ''Hurlyburly'' where, energetic and fabulously adaptable, Spacey rotated through each of the male parts (he'd later appear as Mickey in the screen version too). Next came [[Anton Tchekhov]]'s ''The Seagull'' and a period, in 1986, performing Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre.
But his fame as a stage actor really began in 1986, when he was cast opposite [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Peter Gallagher]] and [[Bethel Leslie]] as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son in [[Jonathan Miller]]'s lauded production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''A Long Day's Journey into Night''. He made his first major television appearance in the second season premiere of ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]'', playing a [[Kennedy family|Kennedy-esque]] American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a [[Tony Award]] for his portrayal of "Uncle Louie" in [[Neil Simon]]'s Broadway hit ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became a well known theatre actor.<ref name="abc" />

Some of Spacey's earlier roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on ''[[L.A. Law]]'', the [[made-for-television]] film ''[[The Murder of Mary Phagan]]'' (1988) opposite [[Jack Lemmon]], and the [[Richard Pryor]]/[[Gene Wilder]]-starring comedy ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). Spacey earned an avid fan base following after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the [[television]] series ''[[Wiseguy]]''. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of the bickering [[Connecticut]] couple in the [[dark comedy]] ''[[The Ref]]'' (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'', and the put-upon office manager in the all-star ensemble film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics.

In 1995, Spacey appeared in ''[[Se7en]]'' with [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], making a sudden and unexpected entrance late in the film as the serial killer John Doe after going unmentioned in the film's ads and opening credits.

The crippled criminal Verbal Kint in ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' launched him to A-list status and won him an [[Academy Award]] for Best Supporting Actor.

In 1996, Spacey played an egomaniacal [[district attorney]] in ''[[A Time to Kill (film)|A Time to Kill]]'', and founded [[Trigger Street Productions]] in 1997 with the purpose of producing and developing [[entertainment]] across various [[Mass media|media]]. In 1996 he made his directorial debut with the film ''[[Albino Alligator]]''. The film was a failure at the box office but Spacey's direction was praised.

[[Image:Spacey beauty.jpg|thumb|Kevin Spacey in his Oscar winning role as Lester Burnham in ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''.]]
Spacey won universal praise and a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] for his role as a [[depression (mood)|depressed]] suburban father who re-evaluates his life in 1999's ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''; the same year, he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Spacey also earned another Tony  nomination the same year for his work in a Broadway production of ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]''.  During the several years following ''American Beauty'''s release, Spacey appeared in films that he believes hadn't done as well critically or in terms of box office. In 2001, Spacey co-hosted with [[Dame Judi Dench]] ''Unite for the Future Gala'', the [[UK]]'s fundraiser for the British Victims of [[9/11]] and [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] at [[London]]'s [[Old Vic Theatre]], produced by [[Harvey Goldsmith]] and [[Dominic Madden]].

He played a physically and emotionally scarred grade school teacher in ''[[Pay It Forward]]'', a patient in a mental institution who may or may not be an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] in ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-Pax]]'', and [[singer]] [[Bobby Darin]] in ''[[Beyond the Sea (film)|Beyond the Sea]]''. ''Beyond The Sea'' was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, and starring duties in the [[biography]]/musical about Darin's life, career, and relationship with late actress [[Sandra Dee]]. Spacey provided his own vocals on the ''Beyond the Sea'' [[soundtrack]] and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of the film's release. He received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance. However, reviewers criticized the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer's life depicted in the film. Spacey has said that despite criticism, he is still proud of the film.

Spacey hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' twice: first in 1997 with musical guest [[Beck]] and special guests [[Michael Palin]] and [[John Cleese]] from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. In this episode, Spacey parodied [[Christopher Walken]], [[Walter Matthau]], and [[Jack Lemmon]] in a three-part pre-taped sketch about actors who auditioned for the original [[Star Wars]] movie; and again in the last episode of season 31 with musical guest [[Nelly Furtado]] where Spacey played a detective in the sketch "Two A-Holes At A Crime Scene", one of the Falconer's past selves in Will Forte's sketch, "The Falconer", a parody of [[Neil Young]] in a commercial for a new album with songs by musicians against George W. Bush and his administration, and as himself in a parody of ''The Usual Suspects''.

In 2006, Spacey played the nefarious [[Lex Luthor]] in the [[Bryan Singer]]-directed [[superhero]] film, ''[[Superman Returns]]''. It recently was confirmed he will return in the sequel, scheduled for 2009. Spacey also appeared in ''[[Edison Force]]'', co-starring [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[Justin Timberlake]]; ''Edison Force'' received a direct-to-video release on [[July 18]], [[2006]]. In 2008, he played an [[MIT]] lecturer in the film ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'', along with [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], and [[Jim Sturgess]]. The film is based on [[Ben Mezrich]]'s best seller, ''[[Bringing Down the House (book)|Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions]]'', a story of student MIT card-counters who used [[mathematical probability]] to aid them in card games such as [[blackjack]]. 

Spacey is well-known in Hollywood for his [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressions]] as when he appeared on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' he imitated, at host James Lipton's request: [[Jimmy Stewart]], [[Johnny Carson]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Al Pacino]] and [[Jack Lemmon]].

Capitol/EMI's "Forever Cool" (2007) features two duets with Spacey and the voice of the late [[Dean Martin]]: "Ain't That a Kick in the Head" and "King of the Road."

===The Old Vic===
In February 2003, Spacey announced that he was returning to [[London]] to become the artistic director of the [[Old Vic]], one of the city's oldest theatres.<ref name="bbc20030203">{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Spacey 'to run Old Vic' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2723437.stm | work=BBC News | date=3 February 2003| accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> Appearing at a press conference alongside [[Dame Judi Dench]] and [[Sir Elton John]], he promised both to appear on stage and to bring in big-name talent.<ref name="bbc20030206">{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Spacey becomes London theatre boss | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2727845.stm | work=BBC News | date=6 February 2003 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> Spacey undertook to remain in the post for a full ten years. He thus became the first Artistic Director of the newly formed Old Vic Theatre Company, which stages shows eight months out of the year. Its first season, starting in September 2004, opened with the British premiere of the play ''[[Cloaca (film)|Cloaca]]'' by [[Maria Goos]], directed by Spacey, which opened to mixed reviews.<ref name="firstseason">{{cite web | title=A Brief History of the Old Vic | url=http://www.oldvictheatre.com/history.php | date=2008 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> In the 2005 season, Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut, to good notices, in the title role of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' directed by [[Trevor Nunn]].<ref name="firstseason"/>

After that, in mid 2006, Spacey noted that he was having the time of [his] life working at the Old Vic, and explained that at this point in his career, he felt that he was "trying to do things now that are much bigger and outside himself.<ref name="nyt-oldvic">{{cite news | author=Sarah Lyall | title=Beyond a Sea of Criticism, All's Well for Kevin Spacey at Old Vic | work=New York Times | date=29 May 2006 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/theater/29spac.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>  He performed in productions of ''National Anthems'' by Dennis McIntyre, and ''[[The Philadelphia Story]]'' by [[Philip Barry]] in which he played the role made famous by Cary Grant in the film version. Critics applauded Spacey's daring for taking on the management of a theatre, but noted that while his acting was impressive, his skills and judgment as a producer/manager had yet to develop. 
However in the 2006 season, Spacey suffered a humiliating failure with a production of ''[[Resurrection Blues]]'', a little-known Arthur Miller play, directed by film director [[Robert Altman]].<ref name="bbc20060413">{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Spacey defends Old Vic management | work=BBC News |date=13 April 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4905638.stm | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> Despite an all-star Hollywood cast (including Neve Campbell and Matthew Modine) and the pedigree of Miller's script, Spacey's decision to lure Altman to the stage proved disastrous: after a fraught rehearsal period, the play opened to a critical panning, and closed only a few weeks into its run.<ref name="nyt-oldvic"/> Spacey resurrected his game later in the year, starring in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[A Moon for the Misbegotten]]'' along with [[Colm Meaney]] and Eve Best. The play received excellent reviews for Spacey and Best, and was transferred to Broadway in 2007.

For the spring part of the 2007-8 season American film actor Jeff Goldblum and British Laura Michelle Kelly joined Spacey as the three characters in [[David Mamet]]'s 1988 play [[Speed-the-Plow]].<ref name="stage20071210">{{cite news | author=Alistair Page | title=Goldblum to join Spacey in the Old Vic’s Speed-the-Plow | work=The Stage | date=10 December 2007 | url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/19128/goldblum-to-join-spacey-in-the-old-vics | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

Spacey was awarded an  [[Doctor of Letters]], ''honoris causa'' from the [[London South Bank University]] in November 2005.<ref name="londonse1_20051111">{{cite news | title=Honorary degrees for Kevin Spacey and the Bishop  | work=London SE1 Community Website| date=11 November 2005 | url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/1847 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

In June 2008, he has been appointed as a visiting professor of Contemporary Theatre at St Catherine's College, Oxford.<ref>Martin, Nicole.

Mr Spacey is also supporting a vigorous campaign in Waltham Forest set up by two 16 year olds to try and save the only Theatre in their Borough.<ref>http://www.walthamforesttheatre.com</ref>

===Personal life===
In September 2006, Spacey announced his intention to stay on at the Old Vic for at least another nine years, and that due to his continuing UK residency he intends to take up British citizenship when it becomes available to him.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Spacey sets the stage for nine years at the Old Vic | author=Chris Hastings | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/10/nspacey10.xml | date=2006-09-10 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

Spacey is a convinced Democrat and a friend of former President [[Bill Clinton]], having met Clinton before his presidency began. Spacey has described Clinton as "one of the shining lights" of the political process.<ref name="abc" /> According to [[Federal Election Commission]] data, Spacey has contributed US$42,000 to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates and committees.<ref name="politics">{{cite news | work=NewsMeat.com | title=Kevin Spacey's Campaign Contribution Report | url=http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Kevin_Spacey.php | accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref>  He additionally had a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[President Clinton: Final Days]]'', a light-hearted [[political satire]] produced by the Clinton administration for the [[White House Correspondents Dinner]].<ref name="newyorktimes">{{cite news | work=New York Times | title=President Clinton: Final Days (2000) | url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=241447 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

In September 2007, Spacey met [[Venezuela]]n president [[Hugo Chávez]]. Neither of them spoke to the press about their encounter, but hours later the actor visited the publicly funded movie studio, Cinema Villa.<ref>{{cite news | author=Associated Press | title=Kevin Spacey Meets With Hugo Chavez | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/25/kevin-spacey-meets-with-h_n_65739.html | work=The Huffington Post | date=25 September 2007 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

In December of that year, he co-hosted the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] with [[Uma Thurman]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/concert/ | title=Nobel Peace Prize Concert 2007 | publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Committee  | date=2007-12-11 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

Spacey is a bachelor and discreet about his private and sentimental life, of which very little is known.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jeff Mauro | title=Kevin Spacey's balancing act | url=http://www.drivingmrspacey.com/Player2006.htm | work=Player | date=July/August 2006}}</ref> However, [[April Winchell]] revealed, in broadcasts of her KFI show, on her web diary and several other websites, that she and Kevin Spacey dated for a while after high school, during a run of the [[Gypsy]] musical in which they were both performing, and later went to New York together. <ref>{{cite news | author=April Winchell | title=Sexual secrets revealed | url=http://www.aprilwinchell.com/2003/07/11/kabc-friday-july-11-2003/#more%20%20-925}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author=April Winchell | title=memoir contest | url=http://www.aprilwinchell.com/2006/07/28/kabc-friday-july-28-2006/#more%20-898}}</ref> She and Spacey remained friends ever since. Between 1992 and 2000, Spacey dated Dianne Dreyer, script supervisor to [[Anthony Minghella]], [[M. Night Shyamalan]] and [[Sydney Pollack]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Dianne Dreyer and Kevin Spacey on IMDb | url=http://www.imdb.com/find?s=nm&q=Dianne+Dreyer&x=12&y=12}}</ref> He also briefly dated fellow actor [[Helen Hunt]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite news | title=Helen Hunt dating Kevin Spacey | url=http://www.cinema.com/news/item/458/helen-hunt-dating-kevin-spacey.phtml}}</ref>
