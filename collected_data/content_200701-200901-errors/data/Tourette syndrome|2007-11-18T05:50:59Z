'''Tourette syndrome''' (also called '''Tourette's syndrome''', '''Tourette's disorder''', '''Gilles de la Tourette syndrome''', '''GTS''' or, more commonly, simply '''Tourette's''' or '''TS''') is an [[heredity|inherited]] [[neurological]] disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by the presence of multiple physical (motor) [[tic]]s and at least one vocal (phonic) tic; these tics characteristically wax and wane. Tourette's is defined as part of a spectrum of [[tic disorder]]s, which includes transient and chronic tics. 

Tourette's was once considered a rare and bizarre [[syndrome]], most often associated with the exclamation of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks ([[coprolalia]]).  However, this symptom is present in only a small minority of people with Tourette's.<ref name=dude>Schapiro NA. "Dude, you don't have Tourette's:" Tourette's syndrome, beyond the tics. ''Pediatr Nurs.'' 2002 May–Jun;28(3):243–6, 249–53. PMID 12087644 [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/442029 Full text (free registration required).]</ref>  Tourette's is no longer considered a rare condition, but it may not always be correctly identified because most cases are classified as mild.  Between 1 and 11 children per 1,000 have Tourette's; as many as one in a hundred people may have tic disorders,<ref name=NIH/><ref name=CommunitySample>Scahill L, Williams S, Schwab-Stone M, Applegate J, Leckman JF.

PMID 16536365</ref> with the more common tics of eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements.  People with Tourette's have normal [[life expectancy]] and intelligence. The severity of the tics decreases for most children as they pass through [[adolescence]], and extreme Tourette's in adulthood is a rarity.

[[Genetics|Genetic]] and environmental factors each play a role in the [[etiology]] of Tourette's, but the exact causes are unknown. In most cases, medication is unnecessary.  There is no effective medication for every case of tics, but there are medications and therapies that can help when their use is warranted.  Explanation and  reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment;<ref name=Zinner>Zinner (2000).</ref> education is an important part of any treatment plan.<ref>Peterson BS, Cohen DJ.

Quote: "Because of the understanding and hope that it provides, education is also the single most important treatment modality that we have in TS."</ref> 

The [[eponym]] was bestowed by [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825–93) on behalf of his resident, [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette|Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette]] (1859–1904), a French physician and [[neurology|neurologist]], who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.
 
==Classification==
[[Tic]]s are sudden, repetitive, stereotyped, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) that involve discrete muscle groups.<ref name=phenomenology>Leckman JF, Bloch MH, King RA, Scahill L. Phenomenology of tics and natural history of tic disorders. ''Adv Neurol.'' 2006;99:1–16. PMID 16536348</ref>  Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air through the nose, mouth, or throat.

Tourette's is one of several [[tic disorder]]s, which are classified by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) according to type (motor or phonic tics) and duration (transient or chronic). Transient tic disorder consists of multiple motor tics, phonic tics or both, with a duration between four weeks and twelve months.  Chronic tic disorder is either single or multiple, motor or phonic tics (but not both), which are present for more than a year.<ref name=phenomenology/>   Tourette's is diagnosed when multiple motor tics, and at least one phonic tic, are present for more than a year.<ref name=Behavenet>BehaveNet.

Although Tourette's is the more severe expression of the spectrum of tic disorders,<ref name=Bagheri>Bagheri, Kerbeshian & Burd (1999).</ref> most cases are mild.<ref name=TSAWhat>[[Tourette Syndrome Association]].

[[Coprolalia]] (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases) is the most publicized symptom of Tourette's, but it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's. According to the [[Tourette Syndrome Association]], fewer than 15% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia.<ref name=TSAFAQ> [[Tourette Syndrome Association]].

{{Clips of tics}} 
In contrast to the stereotyped movements of other [[movement disorder]]s (e.g. [[chorea (disease)|chorea]]s, [[dystonia]]s, [[myoclonus]], and [[dyskinesia]]s), the tics of Tourette's are temporarily suppressible and preceded by a premonitory urge.<ref>Jankovic J. Differential diagnosis and etiology of tics. ''Adv Neurol.'' 2001;85:15–29. PMID 11530424</ref>  Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals with Tourette's are aware of an urge<ref>Cohen AJ, Leckman JF. Sensory phenomena associated with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome.  ''J Clin Psychiatry''. 1992 Sep;53(9):319–23. PMID 1517194</ref>  that is similar to the need to sneeze or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension<ref>Bliss J. Sensory experiences of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. ''Arch Gen Psychiatry''. 1980 Dec;37(12):1343–47. PMID 6934713 </ref> which they consciously choose to release, as if they "had to do it".<ref>  Kwak C, Dat Vuong K, Jankovic J. Premonitory sensory phenomenon in Tourette's syndrome. ''Mov Disord''. 2003 Dec;18(12):1530–33. PMID 14673893</ref>  Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch.  Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye.  These urges and sensations, preceding the expression of the movement or vocalization as a tic, are referred to as "premonitory [[sensory phenomena]]".  Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette's identify sensory phenomena as the core [[symptom]] of the syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.<ref>Scahill LD, Leckman JF, Marek KL. Sensory phenomena in Tourette's syndrome.  ''Adv Neurol''. 1995;65:273–80. PMID 7872145 </ref><ref>Miguel EC, do Rosario-Campos MC, Prado HS, ''et al.''

Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''"unvoluntary",''<!-- Please do NOT CHANGE "UNVOLUNTARY" to "INVOLUNTARY"; it is not a typo, it is the correct term, please read the text and the references. --><ref name=TSADef/> because they are not strictly ''involuntary''—they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to the unwanted, premonitory urge.  A unique aspect of tics, relative to other movement disorders, is that they are suppressible yet irresistible;<ref name=Dure/> they are experienced as an irresistible urge that must eventually be expressed.<ref name=TSADef/>  People with Tourette's are sometimes able to suppress their tics to some extent for limited periods of time, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward.<ref name=Zinner/>  People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or there may be a marked increase in tics, after a period of suppression at school or at work.<ref name=Dure/>

Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity.<ref name=TSADef/>  They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges.  Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched.<ref name=emed>Black, KJ.

Retrieved on [[27 June]] [[2006]].</ref>  The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.

Although there is no such thing as a "typical" case of Tourette syndrome,<ref name=Zinner/> the condition follows a fairly reliable course in terms of the age of onset and the history of the severity of symptoms. Tics may appear up to the age of eighteen, but the most typical age of onset is from five to seven.<ref name=phenomenology/>  The ages of highest tic severity are eight to twelve (average ten), with tics steadily declining for most patients as they pass through adolescence.<ref name=YaleTicSeverity>Leckman JF, Zhang H, Vitale A, ''et al.''

Initial tics present most frequently in midline body regions where there are many muscles, usually the head, neck and facial region.<ref name=Zinner/> This can be contrasted with the stereotyped movements of other disorders (such as [[stimming|stim]]s and [[stereotypy (psychiatry)|stereotypies]] of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s), which typically have an earlier age of onset, are more symmetrical, rhythmical and bilateral, and involve the extremities (e.g., flapping the hands).<ref name=Rapin>Rapin I. Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome. ''Adv Neurol.'' 2001;85:89–101. PMID 11530449</ref>  Tics that appear early in the course of the condition are frequently confused with other conditions, such as [[allergies]], [[asthma]], and vision problems: pediatricians, allergists and ophthalmologists are typically the first to see a child with tics.<ref name=phenomenology/>

Among patients whose symptoms are severe enough to warrant referral to clinics, [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) and [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) are often associated with Tourette's.  Not all persons with Tourette's have ADHD or OCD or other [[comorbid]] conditions (co-occurring diagnoses other than Tourette's), although in clinical populations, a high percentage of patients presenting for care do have ADHD.<ref name=Disentangling>Spencer T, Biederman J, Harding M, ''et al.''

==Causes==
{{main|Causes and origins of Tourette syndrome}}
The exact cause of Tourette's is unknown, but it is well established that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.<ref name=AN2intro>Walkup JT, Mink JW, Hollenback PJ, (eds).  ''Advances in Neurology, Vol. 99, Tourette Syndrome.''  Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, 2006, p. xv. ISBN 0-7817-9970-8</ref>  Genetic studies have shown that the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known,<ref>Robertson MM (2000), p. 425.</ref> and no gene has been identified.<ref name=Zinner/> In some cases, tics may not be inherited; these cases are identified as "sporadic" Tourette syndrome (also known as [[tourettism]]) because a genetic link is missing.<ref name=Mejia>Mejia NI, Jankovic J. [http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbp/v27n1/23707.pdf Secondary tics and tourettism] (PDF).  ''Rev Bras Psiquiatr''. 2005;27(1):11–17. PMID 15867978</ref> [[Image:Brain structure.gif|thumb|left|Brain structures implicated in Tourette's syndrome]]

A person with Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) to one of his or her children, but Tourette's is a condition of [[Expressivity|variable expression]] and [[penetrance|incomplete penetrance]].<ref>van de Wetering BJ, Heutink P. The genetics of the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome: a review.  ''J Lab Clin Med.'' 1993 May;121(5):638–45. PMID 8478592</ref> Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (transient or chronic tics), or as obsessive compulsive symptoms without tics.  Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention.<ref name=TSAFAQ/>  Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.<ref name=emed/>

Non-genetic, environmental, infectious, or [[psychosocial]] factors—while not causing Tourette's—can influence its severity.<ref name=Zinner/> [[Autoimmune]] processes may affect tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a team at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] proposed a hypothesis that both obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children as a result of a poststreptococcal autoimmune process.<ref>Swedo SE, Leonard HL, Garvey M, ''et al''. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections: clinical description of the first 50 cases. ''Am J Psychiatry.'' 1998 Feb;155(2):264–71.

The exact mechanism affecting the inherited vulnerability to Tourette's has not been established, and the precise etiology is unknown. Tics are believed to result from dysfunction in cortical and subcortical regions, the [[Human thalamus|thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]] and [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]].<ref name=AN2intro/>  [[Neuroanatomy|Neuroanatomic]] models implicate failures in circuits connecting the brain's cortex and subcortex,<ref name=Zinner/>  and [[Neuroimaging|imaging techniques]] implicate the basal ganglia and frontal cortex.<ref>Haber SN, Wolfer D.

==Diagnosis==
According to the revised fourth edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ([[DSM-IV-TR]]), Tourette’s Disorder may be diagnosed when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics (although these do not need to be concurrent) over the period of a year, with no more than three consecutive tic-free months.  The previous DSM-IV included a requirement for "marked distress or significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning", but this requirement was removed in the most recent update of the manual, in recognition that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criterion for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.<ref>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. [http://dsmivtr.org/2-3changes.cfm Summary of Practice:  Relevant changes to DSM-IV-TR.]  Retrieved on [[25 January]] [[2007]].</ref>  The onset must have occurred before the age of 18, and cannot be attributed to the "direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition".<ref name=Behavenet/>  Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as [[autism]] or other causes of [[tourettism]]—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. 

There are no specific medical or screening tests that can be used in diagnosing Tourette's;<ref name=phenomenology/>  it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, partly because of the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely-recognized and publicized cases).<ref name=YaleTicSeverity/>
The diagnosis is made based on observation of the individual's symptoms and family history, and after ruling out [[tourettism|secondary causes of tic disorders.]]<ref name=TSAFAQ/>  In patients with a typical onset and a family history of tics or obsessive–compulsive disorder, a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient.<ref name=Bagheri/>  

If a physician believes that there may be another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition.  An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and [[seizure]] activity exists, which would call for an [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], or if there are symptoms that indicate an [[MRI]] to rule out brain abnormalities.<ref name=Assessment>Scahill L, Erenberg G, Berlin CM Jr, Budman C, Coffey BJ, Jankovic J, Kiessling L, King RA, Kurlan R, Lang A, Mink J, Murphy T, Zinner S, Walkup J; Tourette Syndrome Association Medical Advisory Board: Practice Committee.

PMID 16554257</ref>  [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] levels can be measured to rule out [[hypothyroidism]], which can be a cause of tics.  [[Brain imaging]] studies are not usually warranted.<ref name=Assessment/>  In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a [[Drug test#Urine drug screen|urine drug screen]] for [[cocaine]] and [[stimulants]] might be necessary.

Secondary causes of tics (not related to inherited Tourette syndrome) are commonly referred to as [[tourettism]].<ref name=Mejia/>  [[Dystonia]]s, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the [[differential diagnosis]] for Tourette syndrome.<ref name=Bagheri/>  Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include [[developmental disorder]]s, [[autism spectrum disorder]]s,<ref>Ringman JM, Jankovic J.

Because comorbid conditions such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics, these conditions are included in an evaluation of patients presenting with tics.  "It is critical to note that the comorbid conditions may determine functional status more strongly than the tic disorder," according to Samuel Zinner, MD.<ref name=Zinner/>  The initial assessment of a patient referred for a tic disorder should include a thorough evaluation, including a family history of tics, ADHD, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and other chronic medical, psychiatric and neurological conditions.  Children and adolescents with TS who have learning difficulties are candidates for psychoeducational testing, particularly if the child also has ADHD.<ref name=Assessment/>  Undiagnosed comorbid conditions may result in functional impairment, and it is necessary to identify and treat these conditions to improve functioning. Complications may include [[clinical depression|depression]], [[sleep disorder|sleep problems]], social discomfort and [[self-harm|self-injury]].<ref name=Bagheri/>

==Management==
{{main|Treatment of Tourette syndrome}}
[[Image:Clonidine pills and patch.jpg|thumb|[[Clonidine]] (or the clonidine patch) is one of the medications typically tried first when medication is needed for Tourette's.]]
The treatment of Tourette's focuses on identifying and helping the individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms.<ref name=Zinner/>  Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] treatment;<ref name=TSAWhat/> instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient.<ref>Robertson MM, (2000), p. 435.</ref> Treatments, where warranted, can be divided into those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves.<ref name=Assessment>Scahill L, Erenberg G, Berlin CM Jr, Budman C, Coffey BJ, Jankovic J, Kiessling L, King RA, Kurlan R, Lang A, Mink J, Murphy T, Zinner S, Walkup J; Tourette Syndrome Association Medical Advisory Board: Practice Committee. Contemporary assessment and pharmacotherapy of Tourette syndrome. ''NeuroRx.'' 2006 Apr;3(2):192–206.  PMID 16554257</ref>  Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions,<ref name=Denckla/> but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.  

There is no cure for Tourette's and no medication that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders.<ref name=Zinner/>  The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, [[behavior|behavioral]] and [[psychology|psychological]] therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]) may help to avoid or ameliorate [[depression (mood)|depression]] and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.<ref name=Zinner/><ref name="Robertson2005PMJ">Stern JS, Burza S, Robertson MM.

[[Image:Haloperidol-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|Model of a [[haloperidol]] molecule. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication sometimes used to treat severe cases of Tourette's.]]Medication is available to help when symptoms interfere with functioning.<ref name=TSAFAQ/> The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—[[Typical antipsychotics|typical]] and [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical]] [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptics]] including [[risperidone]] (trade name{{ref label|TradeName|A|A}} Risperdal), [[ziprasidone]] (Geodon), [[haloperidol]] (Haldol), [[pimozide]] (Orap) and [[fluphenazine]] (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]].<ref name=Assessment/>  The [[antihypertensive]] agents [[clonidine]] (trade name Catapres) and [[guanfacine]] (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics.<ref name=dude/> [[Stimulants]] and other medications may be useful in [[Treatment of Tourette syndrome#Treatment of ADHD in the presence of tic disorders|treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders.]] Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including [[guanfacine]] (trade name Tenex), [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera) and [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclics]].  [[Clomipramine]] (Anafranil), a [[tricyclic antidepressant]], and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]]—a class of [[antidepressant]]s including [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), and [[fluvoxamine]] (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder.<ref name=Assessment/>

Because children with tics often present to physicians when their tics are most severe, and because of the waxing and waning nature of tics, it is recommended that medication not be started immediately or changed often.<ref name=Zinner/>  Frequently, the tics subside with explanation, reassurance, understanding of the condition and a supportive environment.<ref name=Zinner/>  When medication is used, the goal is not to eliminate symptoms:  it should be used at the lowest possible dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects, given that these may be more disturbing than the symptoms for which they were prescribed.<ref name=Zinner/>

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is a useful treatment when OCD is present,<ref>Coffey BJ, Shechter RL. Treatment of co-morbid obsessive compulsive disorder, mood, and anxiety disorders. ''Adv Neurol.'' 2006;99:208–21. PMID 16536368</ref> and there is increasing evidence supporting the use of [[Habit reversal training|habit reversal]] in the treatment of tics.<ref>Himle MB, Woods DW, Piacentini JC, Walkup JT. Brief review of habit reversal training for tourette syndrome. ''J Child Neurol.'' 2006 Aug;21(8):719–25. PMID 16970874</ref> [[Relaxation technique]]s, such as exercise, yoga or meditation, may be useful in relieving the stress that may aggravate tics, but the majority of behavioral interventions (such as relaxation training and [[biofeedback]], with the exception of habit reversal) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported therapies for Tourette's.<ref>Woods DW, Himle MB, Conelea CA. Behavior therapy: other interventions for tic disorders.  ''Adv Neurol.'' 2006;99:234–40.  PMID 16536371</ref>

==Prognosis==
[[Image:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|[[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784) circa 1772. Johnson wrote ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' in 1747, and was a prolific writer, poet, and critic who had Tourette syndrome.]]
Tourette syndrome is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe.  The majority of cases are mild and require no treatment.<ref name=TSAWhat/>  In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, to the extent that casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood.<ref name=AN2intro>Walkup JT, Mink JW, Hollenback PJ, (eds). ''Advances in Neurology, Vol. 99, Tourette Syndrome.''  Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, 2006, p. xv.</ref>  A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning.<ref name=phenomenology/>  The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.<ref name=outcome>Pappert EJ, Goetz CG, Louis ED, ''et al.'' "Objective assessments of longitudinal outcome in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome."  ''Neurology.'' 2003 Oct 14;61(7):936–40. PMID 14557563</ref>

Regardless of symptom severity, individuals with Tourette's can expect to live a normal [[Life expectancy|life span]].  Although the symptoms may be lifelong and chronic for some, the condition is not [[Degeneration (medical)|degenerative]] or life-threatening.  [[intelligence (trait)|Intelligence]] is normal in those with Tourette's, although there may be learning disabilities.<ref name=TSAFAQ/>  There is no reliable means of predicting the outcome for a particular individual. The gene or genes associated with Tourette's have not been identified, and there is no potential "cure".<ref name=TSAFAQ/>

Several studies have demonstrated that the condition in most children improves with maturity.  Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends.  The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence.  One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence.<ref name=YaleTicSeverity/><ref>Burd L, Kerbeshian PJ, Barth A, ''et al.''  Long-term follow-up of an epidemiologically defined cohort of patients with Tourette syndrome. ''J Child Neurol''. 2001;16(6):431–37. PMID 11417610</ref>  However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.<ref name=outcome/>

It is not uncommon for the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children.  Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.

Children with Tourette's may suffer socially if their tics are viewed as "bizarre".  If a child has disabling tics, or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning, supportive [[psychotherapy]] or school accommodations can be helpful.<ref name=TSAFAQ/> Because [[comorbid]] conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) can cause greater impact on overall functioning than tics, a thorough evaluation for comorbidity is called for when symptoms and impairment warrant.<ref name=Bagheri/>

A supportive environment and family generally gives those with Tourette's the skills to manage the disorder.<ref>Leckman & Cohen (1999), p. 37. "For example, individuals who were misunderstood and punished at home and at school for their tics or who were teased mercilessly by peers and stigmatized by their communities will fare worse than a child whose interpersonal environment was more understanding and supportive."</ref><ref>Cohen DJ, Leckman JF, Pauls D.  Neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood: Tourette’s syndrome as a model. ''Acta Paediatr Suppl'' 422; 106–11, Scandinavian University Press, 1997.  "The individuals with TS who do the best, we believe, are: those who have been able to feel relatively good about themselves and remain close to their families; those who have the capacity for humor and for friendship; those who are less burdened by troubles with attention and behavior, particularly aggression; and those who have not had development derailed by medication."</ref>  People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor.  [[Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome#Notable individuals|Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals]] from all walks of life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.<ref name=phenomenology/>

A controlled study on a small group of individuals with Tourette's found that young people with the syndrome have greater [[cognitive control]] over movements than their age-matched controls, possibly because the need to suppress tics results in a more efficient control over inhibitory movements, a skill that confers an advantage when switching between tasks.  Children with Tourette's (in the absence of comorbid ADHD) performed more accurately on a goal-oriented eye-movement task, requiring active inhibition of automatic eye movements, and they made fewer errors than their unaffected peers, suggesting compensatory changes in the brain resulting in greater cognitive control.<ref name="EnhancedCognitive">Mueller SC, Jackson, GM, ''et al.''  Enhanced Cognitive Control in Young People with Tourette's Syndrome.  ''Current Biology''.  2006 Mar 21;16(6):570–73.
