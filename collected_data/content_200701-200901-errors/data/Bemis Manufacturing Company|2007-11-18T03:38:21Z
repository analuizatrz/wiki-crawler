The '''Bemis Manufacturing Company''' is based in [[Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin]] and is best known for its [[toilet seat]] products.  Bemis also manufactures suction canisters, [[sharps]] containers, gas caps, gauges, fluid management systems, and various contracted plastic parts from extrusion and injection molding for companies such as [[John Deere]] and [[Whirlpool Corporation]].

In [[1924]] Al Bemis and George Riddel buy the majority of shares of White Wagon Works while in [[1928]] Al takes controlling interest.

In [[1932]] Bemis purchased toilet seat machinery and patents from Crocker Chair Company and in [[1935]] wins the account to make seats for [[Kohler Company]] toilets.
