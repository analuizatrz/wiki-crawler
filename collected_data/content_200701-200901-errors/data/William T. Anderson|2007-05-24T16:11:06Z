'''William T. Anderson''' a.k.a "'''Bloody Bill'''" ([[1839]]&ndash;[[October 26]], [[1864]]) was a pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leader in the [[American Civil War]], known for his brutality towards [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers and pro-Union civilians in [[Missouri]] and [[Kansas]]. 

==Early years==

Born in [[Kentucky]], Anderson grew up near Huntsville in [[Randolph County, Missouri]] with his parents, William C. Anderson, a hat maker, and Martha (Thomason) Anderson. In 1850, his father travelled to [[California]], leaving Anderson and his two brothers, Ellis and James, to provide for the family in his absence. After William Anderson Sr. returned from California, the Anderson family moved to [[Agnes City Township, Kansas]], in 1857. 

Anderson worked for a time on a wagon train and allegedly was suspected of horse theft. He supposedly conducted several forays into Missouri, primarily to steal horses. 
Anderson's father was shot dead in March 1862. Most accounts claim a neighbor did it and that Anderson and his brother Jim later confronted the neighbor, killing him and another man. 
Now in trouble with the law, Anderson had to leave Kansas.

==Anderson as a guerrilla==

By the spring of 1863, if not earlier, Anderson and his brother Jim had become [[bushwhacker]]s and joined [[Quantrill's Raiders|Quantrill's Confederate guerrilla company]]. Anderson later became one of Quantrill's lieutenants.  The same year, Union authorities, frustrated by their failure to stamp out the bushwhackers, decided to arrest relatives of the leading members of Quantrill's guerrilla company. Anderson's sisters, Mary, Josephine, and Martha, were imprisoned with nine other women, all accused of assisting Confederate partisans. They were housed in a [[Kansas City, Missouri]] building which had been made structurally unsound by Union soldiers, who removed partitions and posts in an effort to make more space. On [[August 14]], the building collapsed, killing four of the women, including Josephine. Anderson's sister Mary survived, but was permanently crippled. This incident has been considered the spark for the virulent brutality that Anderson would henceforth demonstrate against Union soldiers and civilians. 

During the winter of 1863/64, Bill Anderson married Bush Smith of Sherman, Texas.

==Raids on Lawrence, Kansas, and Centralia, Missouri==

Anderson participated in Quantrill's raid on [[Lawrence, Kansas]] on [[August 21]], [[1863]], which was meant to avenge the [[Sacking of Osceola]], Missouri by Kansas [[Jayhawkers]] nearly two years earlier.  About 200 civilian men and boys were reported to have been killed and many homes and buildings in Lawrence were burned to the ground. Soon afterward, Quantrill led his men on a winter retreat to Texas. There he and Anderson quarreled, and Anderson returned to Missouri in March 1864 at the head of his own guerrilla organization.

In 1864 Anderson gained notoriety for his particular savagery against Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers alike. He and his men usually shot their prisoners, and often mutilated and scalped the dead. He dictated or perhaps personally wrote letters to newspapers in [[Lexington, Missouri]], promising further violence against pro-Union civilians and threatening to take women of Union families as hostages. In one of them, he wrote: "I have chosen guerilla warfare to revenge myself for the wrongs that I could not honorably avenge otherwise. I lived in Kansas when the war commenced. Because I would not fight the people of Missouri, my native state, the Yankees sought my life but failed to get me. Revenged themselves by murdering my father, destroying all my property, murdered one of my sisters and have kept the other two in jail for 12 months. But I have fully glutted my vengeance. I have killed many, I am a guerilla. I have never belonged to the Confederate Army, nor do my men."

That year he was joined by a group of recruits who had served briefly with [[Archie Clement]], his own lieutenant; these recruits included [[Frank James]], who had been one of Quantrill's Raiders, and the sixteen-year-old [[Jesse James (outlaw)|Jesse James]]. During this time, Anderson's men adopted the practice of dangling the bloody scalps of their victims from their horse bridles.

On [[September 27]], [[1864]], Anderson led fellow [[bushwhacker]]s in the [[Centralia Massacre (Missouri)]], looting and burning buildings and terrifying the local populace. They barricaded the tracks of the Northern Missouri Railroad, and forced a train to stop. They robbed the civilian passengers, and killed 21 Union soldiers who were returning home to Iowa and northwest Missouri on furlough. Anderson left one Union [[sergeant]] alive for a possible prisoner exchange; the rest he had stripped, shot, and scalped or otherwise mutilated.

The same day, Union Major A.V.E. Johnston of the [[39th Missouri Infantry Volunteers]] set off with his men to pursue Anderson's band. Anderson, in conjunction with other guerrilla leaders such as [[George Todd]], sent out a detachment that lured Johnston into a trap. After discharging their single-shot rifles with little effect, the Union solders retreated in a panic as the guerrillas cut them down. Those who tried to surrender were executed. Around 120 mounted infantrymen were killed in the ambush and pursuit.  Bodies of the soldiers were decapitated and mutilated by some of the guerrillas.

==Anderson's death==
At the time of the Battle of Centralia, the Union command was busy opposing a raid by General [[Sterling Price]], at the head of 12,000 Confederate cavalrymen. Price feinted towards St. Louis, made a attack on the federal garrison at [[Pilot Knob]], then turned west, drawing the Union forces south of the Missouri River. Anderson met briefly with Price, but chose to return to the north side of the river, where he faced only local militia.

Union headquarters assigned militia Colonel Samuel P. Cox the task of eliminating the guerrilla leader. On [[October 26]] [[1864]], Cox managed to locate Anderson near [[Albany, Missouri]]. Ironically, he used one of Anderson's favorite tactics against him. Cox sent a mounted detachment to lure the guerrillas into an ambush. Anderson led his men in a charge straight into the waiting militiamen, who fired a volley. "Bloody Bill" fell from his horse, shot through the head. His surviving men then retreated. Allegedly, a silken cord with fifty-three knots was found on Anderson. It was claimed to be the number of men he had killed. Human scalps were also found on his bridle.
 
Anderson's remains were taken to [[Richmond, Missouri]], put on public display, and photographed. His body was then dragged through the streets before being buried in an unmarked grave in Richmond's Pioneer Cemetery. Years later, a tombstone was placed over his grave, incorrectly giving his birth year as 1840.

==Death Controversy==
As with many notorious characters in American history, Bloody Bill Anderson had those who claimed to be him. During a bank robbery in [[Gallatin]], Missouri in December 1869, Jesse James shot the cashier, mistaking him for Samuel P. Cox, the man James said killed Bloody Bill Anderson. Nevertheless, there are those who insist Anderson had survived. 

In 1924, a [[Brown County]], Texas settler named William Columbus Anderson was interviewed by Henry C. Fuller, a staff writer for the "Brownwood Banner-Bulletin". Anderson claimed he was the real Bloody Bill Anderson, with the same name and middle initial as Anderson's father. He said that another guerrilla's body had been mistaken for his his own. W. C. Anderson lived in a farmhouse at Salt Creek, near Brownwood, dying in 1927 at age eighty-seven.

The following arguments against his being Anderson have been made, with his defenders responding as follows:

*There is the striking, uncanny facial resemblance to Anderson in the photograph of the dead man claimed as Anderson.  

The custodian in charge of the famous photograph of Anderson in a black hat with a star has stated her organization has no authentication nor origin of the photo. Thus it might not actually be Anderson. 

*The papers and personal effects found on the dead man by Colonel Cox's men clearly identified him as Bloody Bill Anderson.  

W. C. Anderson stated in his 1924 interview that another guerrilla rode Anderson's horse into the ambush and the identification was made based on personal belongings found in Anderson's saddlebags.

*Why would Anderson flee to Mexico and create a whole new family, abandoning his lawful wife, Bush Smith, and marrying bigamously?  

Bill Anderson knew the war was over in Missouri (even though his men would continue to fight it for another 7 months?). Mexico was a destination for many ex-Confederates, as is noted in post-war history.

*Why would Anderson, after being the most virulent Confederate guerrilla in all of Missouri, suddenly decide he had had enough of the war and flee, abandoning his men and the cause he had fought for so long?  

It was a well-known tactic of Quantrill's Guerrillas to scatter in many directions when under attack and later re-group. Anderson simply scattered by himself.  

*In future years, why would Cole Younger and other guerrilla veterans repeatedly visit the Richmond gravesite if Bloody Bill wasn't buried there?  

Cole Younger was only reported to have visited the Richmond grave on one occasion.  Dr. L. E. Skinner of east Texas stated in the 1924 interview that Cole Younger had a long meeting with W. C. Anderson and came away convinced that this was the Bloody Bill Anderson he had served with during the Civil War. However, there is no confirmation of Younger's visit from other sources.

 
The following is the complete Henry C. Fuller interview of William C. Anderson as it appeared in the Brownwood Bulletin's "Scrapbook" series written by Lorene Bishop, who was the historian of the Brown County Historical Society. It appeared on October 1, 1989.

In the 1920's Henry C. Fuller was a staff writer for the Banner-Bulletin, a Brown County weekly newspaper. He interviewed many of the pioneers of Brown County and printed their stories in the weekly paper. One man Fuller interviewed was William C. Anderson of the Salt Creek community. Anderson told Fuller that he was "Bloody Bill"
Anderson of the infamous Quantrill Guerrillas of Missouri. Fuller began to write letters and send pictures back to Missouri trying to prove if Anderson was "Bloody Bill" Anderson. Many in Missouri said that he was the Anderson others said that it could not be the Anderson. On Aug. 24, 1924 the San Antonio Express carried this story written by Henry C. Fuller:

'Six miles from Brownwood, on the banks of Salt Creek, a pretty stream, that flows between rocky banks through pecan groves and lovely valleys to the Colorado River, lives Uncle Bill Anderson, now 85 years old, and one time member of the famous Quantrill band of guerrillas. The writer formed the acquaintance of Uncle Bill about five year ago when he came to
this part of Texas and has spent many hours talking to him about the stirring days of the past, at his home on Salt Creek. Uncle Bill, as everybody knows him, is a familiar figure on the streets of Brownwood on Saturday, and spends most of his time when in town at the courthouse, conversing with old time friends and acquaintances. He seldom talks about his connection with the famous band of William
Quantrill, and it is only to the closest friends that he talks at all on this subject.

He joined Quantrill at the beginning of the tragic career of that stormy petrel of the Civil War and was with him in practically [all his] raids against the armies of the Union. Uncle Bill Anderson is supposed to be dead, and the official reports in the office of the secretary of war at Washington, signed by Major Cox of the Union army, show that he was killed in Ray County, Missouri, about the close of the Civil War, and was buried near where he was killed.

In a book written some time ago by a man named Connelly, who is now president of the Kansas Historical Society at Topeka, Kansas, pains are taken to show just how Bill Anderson was killed by Union soldiers. The story is that on a certain occasion while Anderson with a small band of guerrillas was raiding in Ray County, Missouri, far removed from the main band under Quantrill, the Union forces found it out and sent Major Cox with a detachment of soldiers and under sealed orders to go to Ray County and Cox was not to open his
orders until he had reached a certain locality, which he was to do by night, using the utmost secrecy and stealth in doing so and not intimating to his men where he was going.

Major Cox followed the directions, and on reaching the lonely spot in Ray County, he opened his orders and was surprised that they told him he was now in the immediate vicinity of the camp of Bill Anderson, right hand man of Quantrill, and that while most of his men were to ambush or conceal themselves behind a fence on both sides of a long
land that opened from a wooded area, a small detachment was to go forward, locate the band of Anderson and as soon as they had done so, beat a hasty retreat, running back through the lane, and the rest of the men under Cox were to fire upon the guerrillas and kill them as they came by. The plan worked fine, but when the scouts located Bill Anderson, and Anderson's men gave instant pursuit, Anderson himself did not go.

However, one of his lieutenants mounted on the fine horse of Anderson had joined in the chase. Every man was killed in ambush in the lane, just as the orders of Cox anticipated, and the one on the big horse known to belong to Anderson, was taken for Anderson.

As soon as Bill Anderson heard the shooting he knew that an ambuscade had told the story, and mounting another horse in camp he plunged into the woods and escaped. This was his last escapade of the war.

Leaving Missouri, he rode southward and kept on riding, riding until he reached what is now the State of Texas, and then he rode on and on, intending to go to Mexico and locate there. By and by he reached the lovely valley of Salt Creek, in what is now Brown County. Nobody lived here then, and once in (a) while roving bands of Indians passed through the country. It was a charming place on an extreme feather edge of things. Blue bonnets were in bloom as far as the eye could
see. Antelope and deer and an occasional buffalo and wild turkeys and prairie chickens added to the interest and beauty of the landscape. Through this lovely valley the little stream that Uncle Bill named Salt Creek wended its way, between great groves of pecan trees.

In the distance great hills formed as attractive and satisfactory background. As Bill Anderson, then a young man, looked upon the peaceful scene, far removed from strife and from human habitation, he made up his mind at once to go no further in search of a place in which to locate and build a home. So tethering his horse in the midst of as fine grass as was ever tasted by the equine species, and after broiling a fine steak from a deer which he shot, the wanderer spread his blanket and with his saddle under his head was soon
sleeping quietly, and dreaming perhaps of the stirring days with Quantrill back in Missouri. On the following day he rode up and down the valley, and at last selected the place on which to build his house.

The house was built of logs - a double-roomed affair, and still stands, although he has added to it as the years passed, covering it by and by with lumber hauled on ox wagons from Fort Worth. In time Bill married and children came to bless the union as the old saying goes. These children grew to manhood and womanhood, married and now in Brown County, all good people and doing their part toward making the world and humanity better in every way.'

==The Hollywood version==
In the movie [[The Outlaw Josey Wales]], the title character, played by [[Clint Eastwood]], is visited by Bloody Bill Anderson and his men after the slaughter of Josey Wales' family by Kansas [[Jayhawkers]]. Wales agrees to ride with Anderson to "''set things right''."
