'''Ronald Ernest “Ron” Paul''' (born [[20 August]] [[1935]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] and [[politician]] from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he has represented [[Texas's 14th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] since 1997, and had previously served as the representative from [[Texas's 22nd congressional district|Texas's 22nd district]] in 1976 and from 1979 to 1985. 

In 1984, Paul ran in the Republican [[Primary election|primary]] for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat vacated by [[John Tower]], but the nomination went to [[Phil Gramm]]. Paul also supported [[term limit]]s for [[members of Congress]] at the time and likened himself to the famous Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. Paul was the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] nominee for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 election]]. After his failed presidential bid, Paul returned to Congress in 1997. He was again elected as a Republican, but against the wishes of the party leadership, which had backed Paul's primary opponent. His opponent in the primary was the incumbent representative, a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who had switched his party affiliation to Republican in the aftermath of the 1994 [[Republican Revolution]].  On [[11 January]] [[2007]], Paul announced the formation of an [[exploratory committee]] for a [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].  

== Early life and education ==
Paul was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. He graduated from [[Dormont High School]] in [[Dormont, Pennsylvania]], in 1953. Paul attended [[Gettysburg College]], receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1957, and the [[Duke University School of Medicine]], receiving [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1961. He did his internship and [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] at [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] from 1961 to 1962, and was a [[flight surgeon]] in the [[United States Air Force]] from 1963 to 1968. Paul completed [[obstetrics and gynecology]] training at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] while in the Air Force from 1965&ndash;1968, and in 1968 he and his wife Carol moved to [[Surfside Beach, Texas]].

=== Early political career ===
He became a [[delegate]] to the Texas state Republican [[Political convention|convention]] in [[1974]]. He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for election to Congress in 1974 against the incumbent Democrat [[Robert R. Casey]]. When President [[Gerald R. Ford]] appointed Casey as head of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], a special election was held in April 1976 to replace him. Paul won that election but lost six months later in the general election to Democrat [[Robert Gammage|Robert A. Gammage]]. He then defeated Gammage in a [[1978]] rematch. Paul won new terms in [[1980]] and [[1982]]. He was the first congressman to propose term limit legislation for the House of Representatives. Paul was an unsuccessful candidate for US Senate in the 1984 GOP primary. In 1985 Paul returned to medical practice. He was succeeded by [[Tom DeLay]]. 

In 1988, Paul won the nomination of the [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]] for the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidency]]. He placed third in the popular vote (with 431,750 votes - 0.47%), behind [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Michael Dukakis]].

=== Return to Congress ===
In 1996, Paul was again elected to the House as a Republican. Mainstream Republican Party figures backed the incumbent, [[Greg Laughlin]], a Democratic representative who had switched parties in the wake of the Republican takeover of Congress.  Laughlin attempted to portray Paul's views as extreme and eccentric, but Paul won the primary and went on to win the general election. 

Leaders of the Texas Republican Party made similar efforts to defeat him in [[1998]], but he again won the primary and the election. The Republican congressional leadership then agreed to a compromise: Paul votes with the Republicans on procedural matters and remains nominally Republican in exchange for the committee assignments normally due according to his seniority. This is arguably similar to the deal that [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]] had with the Democratic Party (though Jeffords was elected as a Republican and was officially an independent until his retirement in January 2007). Paul was convincingly re-elected in [[2000]] and [[2002]]. He was elected unopposed in 2004 to his ninth term in the Congress, and was re-elected again in 2006 by a 20% margin.[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/TX/index.html]  He is a member of the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]].

== Political affiliations and support ==

Ron Paul joined the Libertarian Party in [[1987]] as a lifetime member, a status which he appears never to have renounced. Though only elected to Congress as a Republican, Paul remains on good terms with the Libertarian Party and has addressed its [[Libertarian National Convention|national convention]] as recently as [[2004]].[http://www.theadvocates.org/liberator/vol-09-num-10.htm]

Libertarian Party spokesman George Getz said that thousands of libertarians across the United States donated money to Ron Paul's campaign funds. Campaign disclosures reveal that 71.4% of contributions to Paul's coffers come from outside his home state of Texas. [http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/geog.asp?CID=N00005906&cycle=2004] Unlike many political candidates, Paul receives the overwhelming majority of his [[campaign finance|campaign contributions]] (92.5% in 2004 and 96.8% in 2006) from individuals. [http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?CID=N00005906&cycle=2004][http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?CID=N00005906&cycle=2006]

Paul is also a former national chair of the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]], the libertarian wing of the Republican Party.  
[http://fl.rlc.org/]

== Views ==

Paul professes a [[Constitutionalism|Constitutionalist]] (limited government), [[libertarian]] [[ideology]]. His regular votes against almost all proposals for [[government spending]], [[initiatives]], or [[taxes]], and his frequent dissents in otherwise unanimous votes have irritated some of his Republican colleagues and have earned him the nickname “Dr. No” (an example being his dissenting vote in the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] where he was one of three Representatives voting against it[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll348.xml]).

=== Foreign policy ===
Congressman Paul advocates a strict [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist foreign policy]]. He voted against the [[Iraq War Resolution]], which authorized the war, and continues to criticize the US presence in [[Iraq]], and what he charges is the use of the [[war on terror]] to curtail [[civil liberties]]. He is currently speaking against the "dangerous military confrontation approaching with Iran and supported by many in leadership on both sides of the aisle"[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2007/cr021407.htm]. He has also broken with his party by voting against the [[Patriot Act]] in [[2001]] and again in [[2005]], and is very opposed to a [[military draft]]. He  endorses American withdrawal from the [[United Nations]].

His base of support has been among [[American conservatism|conservative]] and [[Libertarian Republican|libertarian Republicans]], but after [[9/11]] he has gained some strong support from liberal Democrats in central Texas because of his consistent opposition to the [[war in Iraq]]. As an example of this shift, the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' newspaper, a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] alternative weekly newspaper in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], described his views as erratic in 2000.[http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2000-11-03/pols_feature.html] After 9/11 though, the Chronicle took a much more favorable view of Paul, praising him for his strong principled opposition to the Iraq War.

In a recent speech before the House of Representatives, Paul expressed his concern about the possibility of an Iran War. He claimed that the current circumstances with Iran are similar to those under which the Iraq War began, and urged Congress not to authorize a war with [[Iran]].

Ron Paul voted against the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA), claiming that it increased the size of government and was unconstitutional.

Ron Paul has taken some positions on foreign policy issues that some libertarians do not agree with.  He has supported border security and opposed [[illegal immigration]].

=== Economic views ===
Paul's economic views oppose nearly all government intervention in the market. He supports the [[abolition]] of the [[income tax]], most [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet departments]] and the [[Federal Reserve]]. His opposition to the Federal Reserve is based on his belief that instead of containing inflation, the Federal Reserve, in theory and in practice, is responsible for causing inflation. Paul believes that in addition to eroding the value of individual savings, this creation of inflation leads to [[boom and bust|booms and busts]] in the economy. This economic theory is known as [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]]. Thus Paul would say that government, via a [[central bank]] (the Federal Reserve), is the primary cause of economic [[recession|recessions and depressions]]. He has stated in numerous speeches that most of his colleagues in Congress are unwilling to abolish the central bank because it funds many government activities. He says that to compensate for eliminating the "hidden tax" [http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2006/tst071706.htm] of [[inflation]], Congress and the president would instead have to raise taxes or cut government services, either of which could be politically damaging to their reputations. He also endorses defederalization of the healthcare system. Paul's campaign slogan for 2004 was "The Taxpayers' Best Friend!". [http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/]

John Berthoud, president of the [[National Taxpayers Union]], an organization that promotes lower tax rates, has said, "Ron Paul has always proven himself to be a leader in the fight for taxpayer rights and fiscal responsibility... No one can match his record on behalf of taxpayers." He is frequently considered an advocate of small business. Jack Farris, president of the [[National Federation of Independent Business]], has said, "Congressman Ron Paul is a true friend of small business....He is committed to a pro-small-business agenda of affordable health insurance, lower taxes, [[tort reform]], and the elimination of burdensome mandates."[http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/saying.html]

==== Support for the gold standard ====
In many public speeches Paul has called for the re-introduction of the [[gold standard]], the effect of which would result in the United States Government making large purchases of [[gold]] and issuing currency only to the extent of its ownership of gold. Ron Paul supports the gold standard to prevent inflation.  [http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul162.html][http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul163.html] 

He has also called for the removal of all taxes on gold transactions.[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr090503.htm] In 2002 he proposed legislation abolishing the [[Federal Reserve]] Board, enabling “America to return to the type of monetary system envisioned by our Nation's founders: one where the value of money is consistent because it is tied to a commodity such as gold.”[http://www.underreported.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=175]	 
Paul's personal financial disclosures reveal extensive private investments in gold and silver, through equities and warrants in companies including Newmont, IAM Gold, Barrick Gold, Golden Star Resources, Golden Cycle Gold Corp, Pan American Silver, Great Basin Gold, Eldorado Gold, Freeport McMoran Gold & Copper, Apollo Gold Corp and Placer Dome.[http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/pfd2003/N00005906_2003.pdf]

Paul suggests that current efforts to sustain [[Dollar hegemony]], especially since collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]] following the United States' suspension of the dollar's conversion to gold in 1971, exasperate a rationale for war. Consequently, when petroleum producing nations like Iraq, Iran, or Venezuela elect to trade in [[Petroeuro]] instead of [[Petrodollar]], it devalues an already overly inflated dollar, further eroding its supremacy as a global currency.  According to Paul, along with vested American interests in oil and plans to "remake the Middle East", this scenario has proven a contributing factor for the war against Iraq and diplomatic tensions with Iran.

=== Medical marijuana ===
Dr. Paul was Co-Sponsor of H.R. 2592, the States' Rights to [[Medical Marijuana]] and is [[affirmative]] to the question "Should marijuana be a medical option?"

=== Industrial hemp ===
In [[2005]] he introduced [[H.R. 3037]], the '''Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2005''', “to amend the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to exclude [[industrial hemp]] from the definition of [[marijuana]], and for other purposes”.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.3037:] This bill would have given the states the power to regulate farming of hemp. The measure would be a first since the national prohibition of industrial hemp farming in the United States.

On February 13, 2007 Rep. Ron Paul introduced [http://www.votehemp.com/PDF/Hemp_Farming_Act_2007.pdf H.R. 1009], the "Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2007," with nine original co-sponsors: Representatives [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-WI), [[Barney Frank]] (D-MA), [[Raúl Grijalva]] (D-AZ), [[Maurice Hinchey]] (D-NY), [[Dennis Kucinich]] (D-OH), [[Jim McDermott]] (D-WA), [[George Miller]] (D-CA), [[Pete Stark]] (D-CA), and [[Lynn Woolsey]] (D-CA).

He believes that the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] does not give Congress the authority to [[Prohibition (drugs)|ban]] or [[Regulation|regulate]] [[drugs]] in general.

=== Election law reform ===
As a former Libertarian Party candidate for President, Congressman Paul has been a proponent of [[ballot access]] law reform, and spoken out on numerous election law reform issues. 

In [[2004]], he spoke out against efforts to abolish the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], stating that such a reform would weaken the “voting power of pro-liberty states”.[http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2004/tst122704.htm]

In [[2003]], he introduced H.R. 1941, the '''Voter Freedom Act of 2003''', that would have created fairer and uniform [[ballot access]] laws for independent and [[third political party]] candidates in Congressional elections [http://www.geocities.com/edwardtjbrown/HR1941.htm].  He supported this bill in a speech before Congress in [[2004]].[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2004/cr071504.htm]

In [[2003]], he spoke out against the enacted law that appoints members of Congress in the event of the death of several members due to an act of [[terrorism]].[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr0604b03b.htm]

In [[2002]], he spoke before the Congress in opposition to campaign finance reforms that place any restrictions on citizens and businesses making campaign contributions to the candidate of their choice on [[First Amendment]] grounds.[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr021302.htm]

=== Abortion ===
Paul is [[pro-life]]. However, Paul believes that the United States Constitution does not grant the federal government any authority to [[legalize]] or [[ban (law)|ban]] [[abortion]].  He believes that abortion is "not a constitutional issue" and should be a decision left to the legislatures of the states. [http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul301.html] Despite these beliefs, he did vote in favour of the federal ''[[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]]''. He has also introduced H.R. 1658 and H.R. 4379  that would prohibit the [[Supreme Court]] from ruling on issues relating to abortion, [[birth control]], the definition of [[marriage]] and [[homosexuality]] and states that the court's precedent in these areas would no longer be binding.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d109:57:./temp/~bdy1p2::|/bss/d109query.html|]--''Please check bad reference''
He once said, “The best solution, of course, is not now available to us.  That would be a Supreme Court that recognizes that for all criminal laws, the several states retain [[jurisdiction]].”[http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul98.html] 

Congressman Paul adheres to the [[consistent life ethic]], and therefore opposes all forms of killing not done in self-defense. His pro-life views factor into his support for [[non-interventionism]], and are the reason he opposes [[capital punishment]]. Paul introduced The Sanctity of Life Act of 2005, which would remove jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in cases involving abortion laws in individual States. This would effectively freeze the current law established by [[Roe v. Wade]], and would allow states to pass laws contrary to [[Roe v. Wade]] with little fear of them being overturned through the Federal court system.  [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.776.IH:].

=== Same-sex marriage and adoption ===
Congressman Paul's position on [[gay marriage]] is that defining and recognizing marriages is not a federal or constitutional matter, but should be left as the [[States' rights|States' right]].[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2004/cr093004.htm] In [[1999]] he voted for [[H.R. 2587]] that banned [[Gay adoption|gay couples adopting children]] in the District of Columbia.[http://www.issues2000.org/TX/Ron_Paul.htm]

He voted against the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] in 2004. In a [[2004]] speech before Congress he expressed support for the Federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and expressed his support for the [[Marriage Protection Act]] as an alternative to the FMA.[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2004/cr093004.htm]

=== Internet and technology ===
In 2006, a "Technology voter guide" by [[CNET]] awarded Paul a score of 80%, the highest score out of both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]].  Paul has been criticized for voting against legislation to help catch online child predators, one of the votes used in the CNET guide. In response to critics, Paul said, "I have a personal belief that the responsibility of raising kids, educating kids and training kids is up to the parents and not the state. Once the state gets involved, it becomes too arbitrary."  He also believed that the proposed law was unconstitutional. [http://news.com.com/2009-1040-6131719.html?tag=topnav]

=== Minor issues ===
Paul's supporters say he is willing to take unpopular positions in order to defend what he regards as constitutional limited government. 

He has been criticized at times for his voting record, being the only dissenting vote against giving [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Mother Teresa]] the [[Congressional Gold Medal of Honor]]. According to ''Texas Monthly'', “When he was criticized for voting against the medal [for Parks], he chided his colleagues by challenging them to personally contribute $100 to mint the medal. No one did. At the time, Paul observed, ‘It's easier to be generous with other people's money.’”

In a speech on [[25 June]] [[2003]], criticizing giving [[Tony Blair]] a Gold Medal of Honor, Paul said, “These medals generally have been proposed to recognize a life of service and leadership, and not for political reasons — as evidenced by the overwhelming [[bipartisan]] support for awarding [[President Reagan]], a Republican, a gold medal. These awards normally go to deserving individuals, which is why I have many times offered to contribute $100 of my own money, to be matched by other members, to finance these medals.”[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr062503.htm] ''Texas Monthly'' awarded him the “Bum Steer” award for voting against a congressional honor for [[cartoonist]] [[Charles Schulz]]. 

He views the new [[American Community Survey]] questions as “both ludicrous and insulting”, viewing that the information is simply none of the government's business.<ref>http://www.free-market.net/towards-liberty/new-census.html</ref>

On January 22, 2007, Paul was the lone member out of 415 voting to oppose a House measure to create a [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] exhibit on [[slavery in the U.S.|slavery]] and [[Reconstruction]].[http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/110/house/1/votes/45/]

Of 9/11 Paul has said "the investigations that have been done so far as more or less cover-up and no real explanation of what went on".[http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2007/200107Paul.htm]

== 2008 Presidential Campaign ==
On [[11 January]] [[2007]], Paul filed papers to form an exploratory committee for the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential race]].[http://thirdpartywatch.com/2007/01/11/ron-paul-running-for-president-again/][http://blog.lewrockwell.com/lewrw/archives/012065.html] This will increase his fund raising opportunities until his presumed eventual announcement.

The [[Associated Press]] reports:
:Kent Snyder, the chairman of Paul’s exploratory committee and a former staffer on Paul’s Libertarian campaign, said the congressman knows he’s a long shot.

:Snyder said Paul is running to win, not just to make a point or to try to ensure that his issues are addressed.  Paul is expected to formally announce his bid in the next week or two, Snyder said.  Snyder said Paul and his supporters are not intimidated by the presence of nationally known and better-financed candidates, such as Sen. [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]] or former Gov. [[Mitt Romney]] of [[Massachusetts]].

:“This is going to be a [[grassroots]] American campaign,” he said. “For us, it’s either going to happen at the grassroots level or it’s not.”[http://www.dfw.com/mld/startelegram/news/state/16438882.htm]

On [[22 January]] [[2007]], [[Reason Magazine]] Senior Editor [[Brian_Doherty_(journalist)|Brian Doherty]] interviewed Paul about his presidential bid.[http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html]  When asked about what issues he would emphasize, Paul responded:

:Everything I’ve talked about for 20 years! I think the biggest thing for Republican primary voters is that most Republicans are turned off right now. They’ve had a beating and are reassessing their values. They have to decide what they believe in. The Republican Party has become about big government conservatism, and Republicans need to hear the message they used to hear: that conservatives are supposed to be for small government.

Paul also indicated that his grassroots campaign will attempt to take full advantage of the [[Internet]].

[[NewsMax.com]] reported in January 2007 that many libertarians and conservatives may be turning towards Paul because they are frustrated by their early option in the 2008 front-runners. <ref name="NewsMax">"[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/1/30/151713.shtml Rep. Ron Paul: Running to Win in 2008]". NewsMax.com, [[January 31]], [[2007]].</ref>

On [[20 February]] [[2007]] Paul's exploratory committee posted a formal video of him explaining his reason for running on [[YouTube]].[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPlPT4bncq8]

At the 2007 [[New Hampshire Liberty Forum]], Ron Paul received the endorsement of the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] presidential candidate [[Michael Badnarik]].
