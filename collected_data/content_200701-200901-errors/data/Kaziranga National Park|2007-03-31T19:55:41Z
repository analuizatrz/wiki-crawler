'''Kaziranga National Park''' ([[Assamese]]: কাজিৰঙা ৰাষ্ট্ৰীয় উদ্যান ''Kazirônga Rastriyô Uddyan'' [[IPA]]: [http://www.baruah.in/wiki/kaziranga.wav /kaziɹɔŋa ɹastɹijɔ udːjan/]) is an [[India]]n [[national park of India|national park]] and an [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] situated in the [[Golaghat district|Golaghat]] and [[Nagaon district]] of [[Assam]], [[India]]. It is tourist destination and conservation area particularly notable as a refuge for the endangered Indian [[one-horned rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis''), hosting the largest population of wild Indian one-horned Rhinoceros in the world. The park contains significant stock of three other large herbivores &mdash; the [[Asian Elephant]], the [[Asiatic Water Buffalo]] and the eastern subspecies of the [[Swamp Deer]]. Kaziranga also has the highest density of [[tiger]] in the world and is declared a [[Tiger Reserve]] in 2006. Kaziranga is recognized as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[Birdlife International]] for conservation of avifaunal species.

The park covers an area of over 430&nbsp;[[Square kilometre|km²]] (166&nbsp;[[Square mile|mi²]]) and covered with numerous beels. The main rivers crisscrossing the park are the [[Brahmaputra river|Brahmaputra]], [[River Diphlu|Diphlu]], [[River Mora Diphlu|Mora Diphlu]] and [[River Mora Dhansiri|Mora Dhansiri river]].  Kaziranga is a vast stretch of coarse, tall [[elephant grass]], [[marshland]] and dense [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]]. The park celebrated its centenary in 2005. Kaziranga has been the theme or has been mentioned in several books, documentaries and songs.

There exists a folk story behind the name Kaziranga, which tells of a young man named Kazi from Karbi Anglong who fell in love with Ranga, a village girl. Their parents did not give consent to their affair, so they continued to meet each other in the forest. One day, both of them apparently disappeared in the forest and never returned, and the forest was thereafter named Kaziranga.<ref>{{cite web

In the early 19th century, the area around Kaziranga was not well settled, as it was notorious for wild animals, [[malaria]], frequent floods and unpredictable changing of course of the [[Brahmaputra River]]. With the rise of the [[Assam Tea|tea industry]] in Assam, the forests in the area were slowly cleared for settlements and tea plantations. The local villagers practiced some [[slash and burn]] cultivation, while the [[British Empire|British]] established small permanent colonies for tea cultivation.<ref name= "kazi100">{{cite web

The history of protection in Kaziranga dates back to the early 20th century, when Lady Curzon ([[Mary Victoria Leiter]]), the American first wife of [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], then [[Viceroy of India]] visited the Kaziranga area in 1904.<ref>{{cite web

Kaziranga had already been known for its rhinoceros population. However Lady Curzon saw only [[hoof]] marks and failed to see any rhinoceros. It is rumored that the noted Assamese animal tracker [[Balaram Hazarika]] showed Lady Curzon around Kaziranga and impressed upon her the urgency of conservation of the wildlife.<ref name = "bbc">{{cite news

==Human habitation in the area==
In the past, the forests of Karbi Anglong and the grasslands of Kaziranga National
Park formed one single ecological unit of ideal wildlife habitat with very few human habitations. But with gradual opening up of the area on the southern side of the present day National Highway 37 mostly by the outside settlers and the tea planters, the forest cover has diminished and become fragmented resulting in the loss of continuity of the natural wild habitat between the park and the Karbi Anglong hills.<ref name="unescotech">{{cite web

The area around Kaziranga is part of the Middle Brahmaputra [[flood plains]], and is flooded virtually every year, hence there have not been any large permanent settlements in the area in historic times.<ref name= "kazi100"/>
There are no villages within the boundary of the park. However the area outside the boundary of the park is densely populated. There were 39 villages within a {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} radius of the park, with an estimated population of 22,300 people in 1983&ndash;1984.<ref name = "un"/> According to a 2002 report, the figure has risen to 184 villages with about 50,000 households.<ref name="unescotech"/> A few new settlements have come up in recent times outside the park borders for servicing the booming [[eco-tourism]] industry.<ref name="unescotech"/>

The park is located in the [[Kaliabor subdivision]] of the [[Nagaon district]] and the [[Bokakhat subdivision]] of the [[Golaghat district]], in the state of Assam in India. The administrative headquarters are located in the town of [[Bokakhat]]. It is roughly {{convert|40|km|mi|0}} long and {{convert|13|km|mi|0}} wide, with an area of {{convert|37822|ha|sqkm|0}}, having lost around {{convert|5114|ha|sqkm}} to erosion by the Brahmaputra.<ref>{{Citation

===Physical Geography and Geology===
{{See also|Physical Geography of Assam}}
[[Image:Kazi-sat.PNG|right|thumb|A satellite image of the Kaziranga area showing the shifting waters of the Brahmaputra]] 
Bounded by the hills of Barail and the Mikir Hills to the south, the southern border of the park is roughly defined by the [[River Mora Diphlu|Mora Diphlu]] River, and the national highway NH-37 was once the formal southern boundary of the park.<ref name = "un"/> The Brahmaputra River constitutes the dynamically changing Northern boundary of the park.

Kaziranga National Park’s landscape is the creation of natural forces of [[Silt#Environmental impacts|silt deposition]] and [[erosion]] that has been effected by the river Brahmaputra over hundreds of years. This ongoing process of erosion and deposition becomes more severe during the floods which occur at regular intervals during the monsoon season.<ref name="unescotech"/> The [[Brahmaputra]] river in its {{convert|724|km|mi|0}} flow through Assam recieves more than a hundred tributaries flowing down from the adjoining hills.

[[Geology|Geologically]], as per the [[plate techtonics]], [[Assam]] is in the eastern most projection of the [[Indian Plate]], where it is thrusting underneath the [[Eurasian Plate]] creating a [[subduction zone]]. It is postulated that due to the northeasterly movement of the Indian plate, the sediment layers of an ancient geocyncline called [[Tethys]] (in between Indian and Eurasian Plates) have been pushed upward to form the [[Himalayas]] mountain range.<ref> {{cite book |last=Vasudevan |first=Hari |authorlink= |coauthors=and et.al |title=Fundamentals of Physical Geography |year=2006 |publisher= NCERT|location=New Delhi |isbn=81-7450-578-0 | pages =37 | chapter =Distribution of Oceans and Continents}}</ref> [[Karbi Anglong plateau]] , which is situated to the south of the Kaziranga (along with the Khasi and Garo Hills) are originally parts of the [[South Indian Plateau]] system.

===Climate===
The Middle Brahmaputra Valley is one of the rainiest places on earth (see [[Climate of India]]), and Kaziranga gets around {{convert|250|cm|in|0}} of rain per year. The park is flooded often by the Brahmaputra which is necessary for maintaining the biological balance of the park. It is not uncommon for the park to be flooded for 5&ndash;10 days at a time, and around three quarters of the Western reaches of the park consisting of the Baguri area is annually submerged.<ref name = "un"/><!--what is annually submerged? Does it mean regular annual flood, or is it submerged round the year?-->

The park roughly experiences 3 seasons &mdash; summer, monsoon and winter. The dry and windy summer extends approximately from February to May with mean maximum and minimums of {{convert|37|°C|°F|0}} and {{convert|7|°C|°F|0}}, respectively.<!--summer minimum as low as 7 C??--> The hot and humid Monsoon season extends from June to September. During the monsoon, Kaziranga receives mean rainfall of {{convert|2220|mm|in|0}} brought by the South West monsoon. The winter, extending from November to February, is mild and dry, with the mean maximum and minimum being {{convert|25|°C|°F|0}} and {{convert|5|°C|°F|0}}, repectively.<ref  name="kushwaha">Kushwaha, S.& Unni, M.

[[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]] / [[Wildlife Institute of India]], Dehra Dun. pp. 238-247</ref>

=== Seasonal variation===
Seasonal variations in the vegetation and habitat of the animal is notable in the park. During winter  the shallow [[Beel]]s and [[nallah]]s (small water channel) dry up and the growth of short grasses cover up their beds. The grasses also grow around the perennial Beels. With the end of the monsoon season, herbivorous animals, especially the [[Rhinoceros]] rush in these areas for grazing.<ref name="unescoreport"/>

In the other parts of the park the tall coarse grasses dry up by the month of December and January and are then control burnt by the park staff. After such burning some animals begin to concentrate in the burnt patches and relish the ash and the partially burnt stems of the reeds. With few winter showers fresh grass blades shoot up in the burnt patches attracting larger number of animals to these areas.<ref name="unescoreport"/>

With the onset of the summer season the grasses in the burnt patches grow up quickly and the tender shoots turn into coarse blades, which no longer attract the animals. The temperature also goes up and the animals prefer to remain near the water sources especially around the numerous perennial beels and water streams inside the park.<ref name="unescoreport"/>

During the monsoon, the shallow Beels and the nallahs start to get filled up, firstly by the monsoon showers and later by the floodwaters. The animals gradually start moving towards higher grounds, which are situated around the tree forests. When the flood water covers most of the areas the animals migrate to the nearby Karbi Anglong Hills and other adjoining areas.<ref name="unescoreport"/>

==Administration==
Wildlife wing of Forest department, [[Government of Assam]] is mainly responsible for the administration and management of Kaziranga. However the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]], [[Government of India]] manages the park in the central level along with Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) in the regional level. Kaziranga National Park receives funds from [[Government of India|Central Government]] and State Government under various Plan and Non-Plan Budgets. Central Government provide fund for development of infrastructure and eco-development. The park also receives fund under the [[Project Elephant]] from the Central Government. The State Government funds the park for conservation of rhinos in Assam (under R.C. Scheme), development and management of the park and control of poaching. Most of this funding is used in paying wages and salaries of the staff and in anti-poaching measures, only a little sum is left behind for the development of the park. In spite of the funding from the government the park faces shortage of fund.<ref name="unescoreport"/> The park received a total of US$ 100,000 in 1997 and 1998 under Technical Co-operation for Security Reinforcement scheme from the [[World Heritage Fund]].<ref name="unsummary"/> The park also receives minor monetary help from various national and international [[NGO]]s. There is a plan to generate fund by the money received from the tourist.<ref name="unescotech"/>  Every year a Annual Plan of Operation is prepared based on which funding is done. The administrative head quarter of the park is located at [[Bokakhat]].<ref name="unescotech"/>

The park is led by a Conservator level officer as its Director. A Divisional Forest Officer is the administrative chief executive of the park. There are two Assistant Conservator of Forests and four range forest officers heading park ranges at Ghorakati (Burapahar Range), Baguri (Baguri Range), Kohora (Central Range) and Agoratoli (Eastern Range) respectively. The park is further divided into beats (headed by a forester) and sub beats (headed by forest guard) for administrative purposes.<ref name="unescotech">{{cite web

There are three dirt tracks inside the park corresponding to the three [[forest range]]s of the park for patrolling and to view wildlife by the tourists. The Central or Kaziranga range with Kohora as the entry point covers the Daglang and Foliomari area. Some part of this range is the ''Core Zone'' of the [[Tiger Reserve]] or a [[World Conservation Union#Protected Area Management Categories|Strict Nature Reserve]], where casual visitors are not permitted. The Western range has Baguri as the entry point and covers the Monabeel, Bimoli, Kanchanjuri areas. This range is preferred for seeing [[big game]] like rhinos and water buffaloes. The Eastern range with Agortoli as the entry point covers Sohola and Rangamatia. This is {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} from Kohora and is preferred for birding.

Kaziranga also has the rare distinction of being one of the very few places in the world which contains breeding population of three [[big cat]]s outside [[Africa]] &mdash; the [[Royal Bengal Tiger]], the [[Indian Leopard]] and the [[Clouded Leopard]].<ref name = "splist"/> Kaziranga had a population of around 30 Bengal Tigers during the 1972 census, which grew to 86 in the 2000 census. This made Kaziranga the protected area with the highest tiger density in the world (0.2 tigers /km²), and Kaziranga formally became a Tiger Reserve in 2006.<ref name = "tiger"/>

The park is also home to [[Sloth Bear]]s and to lesser [[felid]]s like the [[Jungle Cat]], [[Fishing Cat]] and the [[Leopard Cat]]. Other small mammals include the rare [[Hispid Hare]] and several common species of [[mongoose]] ([[Indian Gray Mongoose]], [[Small Indian Mongoose]]), [[civet]]s ([[Large Indian Civet]], [[Small Indian Civet]]), small [[canid]]s ([[Bengal Fox]], [[Golden Jackal]])  pangolins ([[Chinese Pangolin]], [[Indian Pangolin]]), [[weasel]]s ([[Hog Badger]], [[Chinese Ferret Badger]]), the [[Particolored flying squirrel]] and [[bat]]s.<ref name = "un"/>

Kaziranga's rivers (especially the adjoining stretch of the Brahmaputra) are home to the blind, highly endangered [[Ganges Dolphin]].<ref name = "un"/>

Even though the ubiquitous Wild Boar is present in Kaziranga, and Assam was part of the historical range of the critically endangered [[Pygmy Hog]], the Pygmy Hog is no longer found in Kaziranga. The [[Indian Javan Rhinoceros]] was probably also an inhabitant of Kaziranga before becoming extinct.<ref name = "wwf">[http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/asia_pacific/our_programmes/areas/projects/indochina_bioregion/cat_loc_cat_tien_background/index.cfm     WWF article], Retrieved on [[2007-02-26]]</ref>

Kaziranga hosts a large number of [[raptor]]s, considered as a sign of a healthy [[ecosystem]]. This includes the rare [[Eastern Imperial Eagle]], [[Greater Spotted Eagle]], [[White-tailed Fishing Eagle]], [[Pallas's Fish Eagle]], [[Grey-headed Fish Eagle]] and the [[Lesser Kestrel]]. Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures. A great majority of these (approximately 99% of the stable population) was wiped out by [[kidney failure]] by consuming the [[veterinary]] drug [[diclofenac]] in [[domestic animal]] carcasses.<ref name="blackwell"/> Of these, the [[Red-headed Vulture]], and [[Eurasian Black Vulture]] are still near threatened due to their large range, but the [[Indian Vulture]], [[Slender-billed Vulture]] and the [[Indian White-rumped Vulture]] have suffered cataclysmic loss of numbers and are virtually extinct in the wild, including Kaziranga. The Indian populations of the other two vultures have also taken similar hits &mdash; the [[Griffon Vulture]] and the [[Himalayan Griffon]], but they are still well represented outside India. The loss of vultures creates a critical [[ecological niche]] vacancy in Kaziranga.<ref name="blackwell">R Cuthbert, RE Green, S Ranade, S Saravanan, DJ Pain, V Prakash, AA Cunningham (2006) "''[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00041.x?journalCode=acv  Rapid population declines of Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus) in India]''",  Animal Conservation 9 (3), 349–354. doi:10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00041.x .

==Flora==
[[Image:Kazi-broadleaf.jpg|thumb|Moist broadleaf forests in Kaziranga]]

Four main types of vegetation types exist in the park;<ref>Talukdar, B. (1995). '' Status of Swamp Deer in Kaziranga National Park''. Department of Zoology, Guwahati University, Assam.</ref> which are the [[Flooded grasslands and savannas|alluvial inundated grassland]]s, [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|alluvial savanna woodland]]s, [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist mixed deciduous forests]] and [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical semi-evergreen forests]]. Based on [[Landsat]] data for 1986, coverage by different vegetation is as follows: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%.<ref  name= "kushwaha"/>

Grasslands dominate the western reaches of the park which are typically lower than the eastern end, with tall elephant grass on the higher ground while the short grasses covers the lower ground surrounding the bheels or flood created ponds.<ref name = "un"/> Annual flooding, grazing by herbivores  and [[controlled burn]]ing maintains and fertilizes the grasslands and reeds. The common tall grasses are sugarcanes ([[Saccharum spontaneum]], [[Saccharum]] naranga), [[Imperata]] cylindrica, [[Erianthus]] spp., [[Arundo donax]] and the Common Reed ([[Phragmites]] karka). Numerous [[forb]]s are present along with the grasses. Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees —- dominant species include [[Careya]] arborea, [[Phyllanthus emblica|Emblica officinalis]], the [[cotton]] tree or [[Bombax ceiba]] (in savanna woodlands), and [[Dillenia]] indica (in inundated grasslands).<ref name = "un"/> 

Impenetrable evergreen forests, near Kanchanjhuri, Panbari and Tamulipathar blocks, are covered by trees such as [[Aphanamixis]] polystachya, [[Talauma]] hodgsonii, Dillenia indica, [[Garcinia]] tinctoria, [[Ficus]] rumphii, [[Cinnamomum]] bejolghota, and species of [[Syzygium]]. Tropical semi-evergreen forests are present near Baguri, Bimali and Haldibari. Common trees and shrubs are [[Albizia]] procera, [[Duabanga]] grandiflora, [[Lagerstroemia speciosa]], [[Crateva]] unilocularis, [[Sterculia]] urens, [[Grewia]] serrulata, [[Mallotus (plant)|Mallotus]] philippensis, [[Bridelia]] retusa, [[Aphania]] rubra, [[Leea]] indica and Leea umbraculifera.<ref> Jain, S.K. and Sastry, A.R.K. (1983). ''Botany of some tiger habitats in India''. Botanical Survey of India, Howrah. 71 pp. </ref>

There are many different aquatic flora in the lakes, ponds and along the river shores. The [[invasive species]] [[Water Hyacinth]] is very common, often choking up open water, but is cleared during destructive floods.<ref name = "un"/>

Another invasive species, [[Mimosa invisa]] of the [[Mimosa]] genus which is [[toxic]] to herbivores, was cleared by Kaziranga staff, with help from the [[Wildlife Trust of India]] in 2005.<ref> ''[http://www.wildlifetrustofindia.org/html/reports/Silent_Stranglers.pdf Silent Stranglers, Eradication of Mimosas in Kaziranga National Park, Assam]''; Vattakkavan et al; Occasional Report No. 12, [[Wildlife Trust of India]], ([[PDF]]).

{{Main|Conservation Management of Kaziranga National Park}}
[[Image:Kazi-graph.png|thumb|Census figures for Kaziranga]]
[[Image:Burning_grass_kazi.jpg|thumb|Controlled Burning of grass in Kaziranga]]
For protection of the wildlife, the legislative status for Kaziranga National Park represents the "maximum protection under Indian conditions” at national, provincial and municipal levels. A list of 12 acts and constitutional safeguards ranging from the Assam Forest Regulation of 1891 to the Biodiversity Conservation Act of 2002 ensure legal protection to the park.<ref name="unsummary"/>

Steps for controlling poaching includes maintenance of existing and construction of new poaching camps, patrolling, intelligence gathering and control over the use of firearms around the park.<ref name= "kazi100"/> To mitigate effect of repeated floods on the environment and wildlife, steps like increasing of patrols, maintenance of existing and acquiring of new speed boats, construction and maintenance of highlands with the help of [[Indian Army]], de-siltation work and removal of water hyacinth in the beels have been taken.<ref name= "kazi100"/> Construction of several corridors and regulation of speed of vehicular traffic to mitigate the number of death of wild animals by speeding vehicles on National Highway-37 are done by the park management.<ref name="highway"/>

To prevent illegal grazing, spreading of diseases and to maintain genetic distinctness of the wild species, systematic steps like enforcement of legal measures, immunization of the livestock in nearby villages and fencing the sensitive areas of the park are undertaken regularly.<ref name= "kazi100"/> To control growth and irradiation of invasive species like Mimosa, research on biological methods for controlling the weeds, manual uprooting and weeding before seed settling are done often.<ref name= "kazi100"/> Grassland management techniques like controlled burning are done annually.<ref name = "un"/> 

===Constraints===
[[Image:Assam 057.jpg|thumb|A board proclaiming the biological wealth of Kaziranga National Park]]

One of the serious problem in conservation has been the poaching of Rhinoceros for its horn. Between 1980 and 2005 the park lost around 567 rhinoceros to the poacher; fortunately this is in a declining trend.<ref name="unescotech"/>

There are about 184 villages and four tea gardens within the influence area of the park. The villagers often enter the park for illegal fishing and for firewood; the villagers also push their livestock into park for food mainly during the dry season, creating risk of spread of diseases and genetic disturbances among the wild animals living inside the park.<ref name="unescotech"/> The tea gardens pose a threat through pesticide run-off, pollution of water bodies, and source of invasive species like Mimosa and wildrose.<ref name="kazichallenges"> {{Citation

==Tourism==
[[Image:Kaziranga-National-Park-map-en-mod.svg|thumb|right|350px|Map of Kaziranga National Park. River courses and lake areas vary annually. River courses are not drawn completely outside park boundaries]]

===Activities===
The means of travel inside the park is on the back of trained elephants with [[mahout]] guides, or in [[Jeep]] or [[4WD]] vehicles. Most rides are booked in advance and depart from the Park Administrative Centre in [[Kohora]]. The Park has three tourist routes under the jurisdiction of three Ranges — Kohora, Bagori and Agaratoli. These roads are open to light vehicles from November to mid May. The park remains closed from mid-April to mid-October due to monsoon. Visitors willing to view wild life by motorcars are guided through these roads by the staff of this department. The visitors are allowed to take in their own vehicles, however no visitor is allowed to enter the park without an accompanying representative of the forest department. [[Observation tower]]s are situated at Sohola, Mihimukh, Kathpara, Foliamari and Harmoti for spotting wildlife. Wildlife watching, including [[birding]] is the main activity inside the park. Viewing the scenic landscape of the park with different vegetation types interspersed with numerous [[beel]]s and the snow covered mountains of Himalayas at a distance constitute other attractions. [[Hiking]] in the park is not allowed taking into consideration the large number of potentially dangerous wild animals. 

===Lodging===
The park has a wide range of accommodation including rest houses, dormitory and lodges maintained by the [[Department of Environment and Forests, Government of Assam]] and the [[India Tourism Development Corporation]]. At present there are four Government tourist lodges of different categories at Kohora and three tourist lodges inside the park. Numerous private resorts are also available outside the borders of the park.<ref name="unescoreport"/>

===Getting there===
The main gate for Kaziranga, at Kohora is on the NH-37. [[Assam State Transport Corporation]] and private buses stop here on their way to and from [[Guwahati]], [[Tezpur]] and Upper Assam. The park is a 4 hour drive from Guwahati ({{convert|217|km|mi|0}}) on the NH-37 and 1.5 hrs from [[Jorhat]] ({{convert|97|km|mi|0}}). Both these cities are well connected to the park by buses and taxies. [[Furkating]] ({{convert|75|km|mi|0}} away) is the nearest railway station, other important stations are Jorhat and Guwahati (GHY) stations. The nearest airports are [[Jorhat Airport]] at Rowriah ({{convert|97|km|mi|0}} away),  [[Tezpur Airport]] at Salonibari (approx {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} away) and [[Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport]], Guwahati (approx. {{convert|217|km|mi|0}} away). The nearest town from the park is Bokakhat ({{convert|23|km|mi|0}} away) and the nearest cities are Jorhat and Guwahati.

==In popular culture==
[[Image:Qnofele.jpg|thumb|Cover of the [[Queen of the Elephants]], showing [[Mark Shand]] and [[Parbati Baruah]]]]
Kaziranga has been the theme of and has been mentioned in several books, documentaries, and songs. The park first came to the limelight after [[Robin Banerjee]]'s (a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] doctor turned photographer and filmmaker) documentary, titled ''Kaziranga'' was aired on [[Berlin]] television in 1961 and became a runaway success. Banerjee's career as a nature filmmaker took off — he went on to make 32 documentaries, and received the [[Padma Shree]] in 1971.<ref>[http://golaghat.gov.in/PERSONAL.HTM Personalities of Golaghat district].
