{{History of Poland}}
Settled agricultural people have lived in the area that is now Poland for the last 7500 years, the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people have been in this territory for over 1500 years, and the '''History of [[Poland]]''' as a state spans well over a millennium. [[territorial changes of Poland|The territory ruled by Poland has shifted and varied greatly]]. At one time, in the 16th century, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was the  largest state in [[Europe]], before the rise of the [[Russian Empire]]. At other times there was no separate Polish state at all. Poland regained its independence in 1918, after more than a century of rule by its neighbours, but its borders shifted again after the [[Second World War]].

Following its emergence in the 10th century, the Polish nation was led by [[List of Polish monarchs|a series of rulers]] who [[Baptism of Poland|converted]] the [[Poles]] to [[Christianity]], created [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|a strong kingdom]] and integrated Poland into the [[Culture of Europe|European culture]]. [[Fragmentation of Poland|Internal fragmentation]] eroded this initial structure in the 13th century, but consolidation in the 1300s laid the base for the new dominant [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] that was to follow.

Beginning with the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Lithuanian Grand Duke]] [[Jogaila]] (Władysław II Jagiełło), the [[Jagiellon dynasty]] (1385–1569) formed the [[Polish-Lithuanian union]]. The partnership proved beneficial for the Poles and [[Lithuanians]], who coexisted and cooperated in one of the most powerful states in [[Europe]] for the next three centuries. The ''[[Nihil novi]]'' act adopted by the Polish [[Sejm]] ([[parliament]]) in 1505, transferred most of the [[legislative power]] from the [[monarch]] to the Sejm. This event marked the beginning of the period known as "[[Golden Liberty]]", when the [[State]] was ruled by the "free and equal" [[szlachta|Polish nobility]]. The [[Lublin Union]] of 1569 established the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as an influential player in [[Europe]] and a vital cultural entity, [[Polonization|spreading]] the [[Western culture]] eastwards.

By the 18th century the nobles' [[democracy]] had gradually declined into [[anarchy (word)|anarchy]], making the once powerful Commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention. Over the course of three successive [[partitions of Poland|partitions]] by the countries bordering it (the Russian Empire, [[Habsburg Austria]] and the Kingdom of Prussia), the Commonwealth was significantly reduced in size the first two times and ultimately ceased to exist in 1795. The idea of Polish independence however was kept alive throughout the 19th century and led to several [[List of Polish wars#Polish uprisings|Polish uprisings]] against the partitioning powers.

[[Polish Independence Day|Poland regained its independence]] in 1918, but the [[Second Polish Republic]] was destroyed by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] by their [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]] at the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. Nevertheless the [[Polish government in exile]] kept functioning and through the many Polish military formations [[Polish contribution to World War II|contributed significantly]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory. Nazi Germany's forces were compelled to retreat from Poland as the Soviet [[Red Army]] advanced, which led to the creation of the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. The country's geographic location was shifted to the west and Poland existed as a Soviet [[satellite state]]. By the late 1980s [[Solidarity]], a Polish reform movement, became crucial in causing a peaceful transition from a [[communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[democracy]], which resulted in the creation of the modern Polish state.

== Prehistory of Poland ==
{{main|Prehistory of Poland (until 966)}}

[[Image:Archeologia (Bielsko) - kultura łużycka.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Lusatian culture]] artifacts]]
The Stone Age era in Poland lasted five hundred thousand years and involved three different [[Human|human species]]. The [[Stone Age]] cultures ranged from early human groups with primitive tools to advanced [[Agriculture|agricultural]] societies using sophisticated [[stone tool]]s, building fortified settlements and developing [[copper]] [[metallurgy]].

The Bronze and Iron Age cultures in Poland are known mainly from [[archaelogy|archeological]] research. Early [[Bronze Age]] cultures in Poland begin around 2400/2300 BC. The [[Iron Age]] commences ca. 750/700 BC. The subject of the [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] and linguistic affiliation of the groups living in central and eastern Europe at that time is, given the absence of written records, speculative, and accordingly there is considerable disagreement. In Poland the most famous archeological finding from that period is the [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement ([[gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]]), representing the [[Lusatian culture]] of the early Iron Age.

Peoples belonging to numerous [[archaeological culture|archeological cultures]] identified with [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Germanic people|Germanic]] and [[Balts|Baltic]] tribes lived in and migrated through various parts of the territory that now constitutes Poland from about 400 BC. Expanding and moving out of their homeland in Scandinavia and northern Germany the Germanic people settled this territory and used it as migrating route for several centuries. Many Germanic tribes moved out of the area in the southern and eastern directions, while other remained. As the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic people left eastern and central Europe for the safer and wealthier southern and western parts of the continent. The northeast corner of modern Poland's territory was and remained populated by Baltic tribes.

According to the currently predominant opinion, the [[Slavic tribes]] were not indigenous to the lands that were to become Poland. Their first waves settled the area of the upper [[Vistula River]] and elsewhere in southeastern Poland and southern [[Masovia]], coming from the upper and middle regions of the [[Dnieper River]], beginning in the second half of the 5th century, some half century after these territories were vacated by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes.

From there the new population dispersed north and west over the course of the 6th century. Slavic people lived from cultivation of crops and were generally farmers, but also engaged in hunting and gathering. Their migration was probably caused by the pursuit of fertile soils and invasions of eastern and central [[Europe]] by waves of people and armies from the east, such as the [[Huns]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] and [[Magyars]].

[[Image:Wislica grodzisko 20070825 1456.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Vistulans|Vistulan]] stronghold in [[Wiślica]] once stood here]] 

A number of such [[Polish tribes]] formed small dominions beginning in the 8th century, some of which coalesced later into larger ones. Among those were the [[Vistulans]] (''Wiślanie'') in southern Poland with [[Kraków]] and [[Wiślica]] as their main centers. Major building of fortified centers and other developments in their country took place in the 9th century. From the early 10th century on the [[Polans (western)|Polans]] (''Polanie'', lit. "people of the fields") of what is now [[Greater Poland]] became a moving force behind the historic processes that gave rise to the Polish state. The tribal unions built many [[gord (Slavic settlement)|gords]] – fortified structures with earth and wood walls and embankments, from the 7th century onwards. Some of them were developed and inhabited, others had a very large empty area and may have served primarily as refuges in times of trouble. The Polans settled in the flatlands around [[Giecz]], [[Poznań]] and [[Gniezno]] that eventually became the foundation and early center of Poland, lending their name to the country. They went through a period of accelerated building of fortified settlements and territorial expansion beginning in the first half of the 10th century, and the Polish state developed from their tribal entity in the second half of that century.

[[Image:Ostrów Tumski Poznań RB1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Ostrów Tumski]] ([[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Poznań|Poznań Cathedral]] on the right) is the area of the early beginnings of the Polish state and church]]

The viability of the [[Poland in the Early Middle Ages#10th_century_developments_in_Greater_Poland;_Mieszko's_state|emerging state]] was assured by the early [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] leaders' persistent territorial expansion, which beginning with a very small area around [[Gniezno]] (before the town itself existed), lasted throughout most of the 10th century, resulting in a territory approximating that of the present day Poland. The Polanie tribe conquered and merged with other Slavic tribes, formed a tribal federation and then a centralized state, which after the addition of [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Silesia]] (taken from the [[Czech lands|Czech]] state during the later part of the 10th century) reached its mature form, including the main regions regarded as ethnically Polish. 

[[Mieszko I]] was the first ruler of the [[Polans (western)|Polans]] tribal union known from contemporary written sources. A pagan "king", Mieszko in 965 married [[Dubrawka]], a Czech [[Christian]] princess. Mieszko's 966 [[Baptism of Poland|conversion to Christianity]] in its [[Western Christianity|Western Latin Rite]] is considered by many to be the founding event of the Polish state. Following Mieszko's 967 victory over a force of the [[Wolin]]ians led by [[Wichmann the Younger|Wichmann]] the first missionary bishop was appointed, which counteracted the intended eastern expansion of the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg Archdiocese]], established at about the same time. Mieszko's state had a complex political relationship with the [[Germany|German]] [[Holy Roman Empire]], as Mieszko was a "friend", ally and [[vassal]] of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], paying him [[tribute]] from the western part of his lands. It fought wars with the [[Polabian Slavs]], the [[margrave]]s of the [[Saxon Eastern March]] ([[Gero]] in 963-964 and [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Hodo]] in [[Battle of Cedynia|972]]), and the Czechs. By around 990, when Mieszko I officially submitted his country to the authority of the [[Holy See]] (''[[Dagome iudex]]''), he had transformed Poland into one of the strongest powers in [[Eastern Europe|central-eastern Europe]].

[[Image:Drzwi gnieznienskie wykupienie zwlok Wojciecha.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Gniezno Doors]] - [[Bolesław I the Brave|Bolesław]] buys [[Adalbert of Prague|Adalbert]]'s body back from the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]]]
 
Contrary to what Mieszko had intended, his oldest son [[Boleslaw I the Brave|Bolesław]] managed to become the sole ruler of Poland. A man of high ambition and strong personality, he embarked on further territorial expansion to the west, south, and east.  While often successful, the campaigns and the gains turned out to be of only passing significance and badly strained the resources of the young nation.  Bolesław lost the economically crucial Western [[Pomerania]] together with the new bishopric in [[Kołobrzeg]]; the region had previously been conquered with great effort by Mieszko. 

[[Bolesław I the Brave|Bolesław Chrobry]] started by continuing his father's policy of alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. He skillfully took advantage of the death of Vojtěch Slavník or [[Adalbert of Prague|Wojciech]], a Czech bishop in exile and missionary, whom Bolesław received and helped and who was killed in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]. The [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]] of Wojciech in 997 gave Poland a patron saint, [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]], and soon resulted in the creation of an independent Polish province of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] with an archbishop in [[Gniezno]]. The [[Congress of Gniezno]] took place in the year 1000, when the young emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] came as a pilgrim to visit St. Adalbert's grave and lent his support to Bolesław. The Gniezno archdiocese and several subordinate dioceses were established on this occasion. The Polish [[ecclesiastical province]] effectively served as an essential anchor and an institution to fall back on for the Piast state, helping it survive in the troubled centuries ahead. Otto died in 1002 and Bolesław's relationship with his successor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] turned out to be much more difficult, resulting in a series of wars in the coming years (1002-1005, 1007-1013, 1015-1018). The conflicts ended in 1018 with the [[Peace of Bautzen]] accord, on favorable for Bolesław terms. In 1018 also Bolesław took over the western part of [[Red Ruthenia]]. In 1025, shortly before his death, [[Bolesław I the Brave]] finally succeeded in obtaining the papal permission to crown himself, and became the first [[list of Polish monarchs|king of Poland]].

[[Image:Matylda wrecza mieszkowi II ksiege liturgiczna.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II]] shown symbolically with Duchess [[Mathilda von Schwaben]]]] 

After Bolesław's death his son, King [[Mieszko II Lambert]], tried to continue his father's politics, having his kingdom act as an interventionist great power. This reinforced much of the old resentment and hostility on the part of Poland's neighbors, which Mieszko's two dispossessed brothers took advantage of, arranging for foreign invasions from the east and west in 1031. Mieszko was defeated and had to leave the country. Although later [[Bezprym]] and Otto were killed and Mieszko partially recovered, with Mieszko's death in 1034 the first Piast monarchy collapsed. Deprived of a government, Poland was ravaged by an [[pagan reaction in Poland|anti-feudal and pagan rebellion]], and in 1039 by the forces of [[Bretislaus I of Bohemia]].

The nation made a recovery under Mieszko's son, Duke [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] (1016-1058), properly known as the Restorer, since he rebuilt the Polish monarchy and through several military campaigns (in 1047 [[Masovia]] was taken back from [[Miecław]], and in 1050 [[Silesia]] form the Czechs) the country's territorial integrity. He was aided in this endeavor by the recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and [[Kievan Rus']], who didn't find the chaos in Poland to be to their liking either. Casimir introduced a more mature form of [[feudalism]], by settling his warriors on feudal estates and turning them into [[landed gentry]], thus relieving the burden of financing large army units from the duke's treasury. Faced with the widespread destruction of [[Greater Poland]] after the Czech expedition, Casimir moved his court to [[Kraków]], which replaced the old Piast capital Gniezno and functioned afterwards as the nation's capital for several centuries.

[[Image:Krakow kosciol 20071229 1246.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[St. Andrew's Church, Kraków|St. Andrew's Church]] in [[Kraków]] (built in 11th century)]]
 
Casimir's son [[Bolesław II the Bold]], also known as the Generous (1040-1081), developed Polish military strength further and, as an active supporter of the papal side in its feud with the German emperors, with the blessing of Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] crowned himself king in 1076. There was an anti-Bolesław conspiracy or conflict that involved the Bishop of Kraków. Bolesław had Bishop [[Stanislaus of Szczepanow|Stanisław]] executed; subsequently Bolesław was forced to abdicate the Polish throne because of the pressure from the Catholic Church and the pro-imperial faction of the nobility. [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|St. Stanislaus]] was to become the second martyr and patron saint of Poland. After Bolesław's exile the country found itself under the unstable rule of [[Władysław I Herman|Władysław Herman]], who was strongly dependent on [[Count palatine|Palatine]] [[Sieciech]]. When Władysław's two sons [[Zbigniew]] and Bolesław finally forced him to remove his hated protégé, Poland from 1098 was divided among the three of them, and after the father's death from 1102 to 1106 between the two brothers.

[[Image:Saint Leonardo vault.PNG|220px|right|thumb|[[St. Leonard's Crypt]] is what's left of the second [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Wawel Cathedral]] of [[Władysław I Herman]]]] 

After a power struggle, [[Bolesław III Wrymouth|Bolesław III the Wrymouth]] (1102-1138) became the Duke of Poland by defeating his half-brother in 1106-1107. Zbigniew had to leave the country, but received support from Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], who attacked Bolesław's Poland in 1109. Bolesław was able to defend his country because of his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum; Zbigniew who later returned was eliminated. Bolesław's other major achievement was the conquest of Pomerania, a task begun by his father and completed by Bolesław around 1123. At that time also the Christianization of the region was initiated in earnest, an effort crowned by the establishment of the Pomeranian [[Wolin]] Diocese after Bolesław's death in 1140. 

Before he died, [[Bolesław III Wrymouth|Bolesław Krzywousty]] [[testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty|divided the country among four of his sons]]; a complex arrangement intended to preserve the country's unity, in practice ushered in a long period of fragmentation. For two centuries the Piasts were to spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Kraków and assigned to the special [[Seniorate Province]] that was not to be subdivided. This principle broke down already within the generation of Bolesław III's sons, when [[Władysław II the Exile]], [[Bolesław IV the Curly]], [[Mieszko III the Old]] and [[Casimir II the Just]] fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the Kraków throne.

Early [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Poland was developing culturally as a part of the European [[Christendom]]. [[culture of medieval Poland|Intellectual and artistic activity]] was concentrated around the institutions of the Church, the courts of the kings and dukes (already Mieszko II and Casimir the Restorer were literate  and educated), and increasingly around the households of the emergent hereditary elite. Along with the ''Dagome iudex'' act, the most important written document and source of the period (the 10th through the end of 12th centuries) is the chronicle by a foreign cleric from the court of Bolesław the Wrymouth known as [[Gallus Anonymus]]. A number of [[Pre-Romanesque]] stone churches were built beginning in the 10th century, often accompanied by "palatium" ruler residencies; those were followed by [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] buildings proper.  Among the preeminent early [[monastic]] religious orders were the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]] and the [[Cistercians]].

The 13th century brought fundamental changes in the structure of the Polish society and political system. Despite the fragmentation and constant internal conflicts, Poland's external borders mostly stabilized during this period. In mid 13th century [[Bolesław II the Bald]] granted [[Lubusz Land]] to  the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which made possible the creation of the [[Neumark]] and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. Polish Western Pomerania broke its political ties with Poland and from 1181 became also dependent on the Margraviate, which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east. [[Pomerelia]] or [[Gdańsk Pomerania]] had been independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In the south-east [[Leszek I the White|Leszek the White]] was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the [[Halych]] area of [[Rus (name)|Rus']], a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.

The social status was becoming increasingly based on the size of feudal land possessions. Those  included the lands controlled by the Piast princes, their rivals the great lay land owners and church entities, all the way down to the knightly class; the work force ranged from hired "free" people, through serfs attached to the land, to slaves (purchased or war and other prisoners). The upper layer of the feudal lords, first the Church and then others, were able to acquire economic and [[immunity (legal)|legal]] immunity, which made them exempt to a significant degree from court jurisdiction or economical obligations (including taxation) previously imposed by the ruling dukes.              

The civil strife and foreign invasions, such as the [[Mongol invasions]] in 1241 and 1259, weakened and depopulated the many small Polish principalities, as the country became progressively more split. This, but also increasing in the developing economy demand for labor, caused a massive immigration of West European, mostly [[Ostsiedlung|German settlers into Poland]]. The German, Polish and other new rural settlements were a form of feudal tenancy with immunity and [[German town law]]s were often utilized as its legal bases. The German immigrants were also important in the rise of the cities and the establishment of the Polish [[bourgeoisie|burgher]] (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws ([[Magdeburg rights]]) and customs which the Poles adopted. From that time on the Germans became one of the minorities in Poland. 

In 1228, the Acts of Cienia were passed and signed into law by [[Władysław III Spindleshanks|Władyslaw III]]. The titular Duke of Poland promised to provide a "just and noble law according to the council of bishops and barons." Such legal guarantees and privileges included also the lower level land owners - knights, who were evolving into the lower and middle nobility class known later as "[[szlachta]]". The fragmentation period weakened the rulers and established a permanent trend in Polish history, whereby the rights and role of the nobility were being expanded at the monarch's expense.   

In 1226 [[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the [[Prussian people]], whose territory bordered his lands and who at that time were being subjected to increasingly forced (including papacy-sponsored [[crusades]]), but largely ineffective Christianization efforts. The [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] quickly overstepped the authority given to them by Konrad and in the following decades conquered large areas along the [[Baltic Sea]] coast and established their [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state]]. When virtually all of the Western [[Balts|Baltic]] pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights turned their attention to Poland and [[Lithuania]]. In 1325 the Poles and Lithuanians made a treaty to defend themselves against the unruly former allies, who were invading their lands. During 1327-1332 the Polish-Lithuanian armies fought the Order, which managed to capture [[Dobrzyń Land]] and [[Kujawy]], recovered by Poland in 1343. The wars continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries, until the remaining state of the Teutonic Knights was converted into the Protestant [[Duchy of Prussia]] under the King of Poland in 1525.

There were numerous attempts to unify the Polish state, including that of the [[Silesia]]n dukes [[Henry I the Bearded]] and his son [[Henry II the Pious]], who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the [[Battle of Legnica]]. In 1295 [[Przemysł II]] of [[Greater Poland]] became the first, since Bolesław II, Piast duke crowned as King of Poland, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including from 1294 [[Gdańsk Pomerania]]) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]] of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]], who married Przemysł's daughter and became King of Poland in 1300. Wenceslaus' heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305. An important factor in the unification process was the Polish Church, which remained a single ecclesiastical province throughout the fragmentation period. Archbishop [[Jakub Świnka]] of Gniezno was an ardent proponent of Poland's reunification; he performed the crowning ceremonies for both Przemysł II and Wenceslaus II. Świnka supported [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław Łokietek]] at various stages of the duke's career.

[[culture of medieval Poland|Culturally]] the 13th century brought a socially much broader impact of the Church, as a network of parishes was established and cathedral-type schools became more common. The leading monastic orders were now the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscan]]s, who interacted closely with the general population. Characteristic of the period was a proliferation of narrative [[annals]], as well as other written records, laws and documents. More of the clergy were of local origin, others were expected to know the Polish language. Their most recognized representative in the intellectual sphere, where there was considerable achievement, is [[Wincenty Kadłubek]], the author of an influential chronicle. [[Gothic architecture]] became the predominant style of churches and castles constructed beginning in the 13th century, and in art forms native elements were increasingly important. Significant advances took place in agriculture, manufacturing and crafts.

The 14th century unified Kingdom of Poland of the last two rulers of the Piast dynasty, [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław the Elbow-high]] and his son [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]], wasn't quite a return of the Polish state from before the fragmentation. The regional Piast princes remained strong and for economic reasons some of them gravitated toward Poland's neighbors. The Kingdom lost Pomerania and Silesia, the most highly developed or economically important of the ethnically Polish lands, which left half of the Polish population outside the Kingdom's borders. The western losses had to do with the German expansion, and the lower [[Vistula]] was controlled by the Teutonic Order. [[Masovia]] was not to be fully incorporated into the Polish state anytime soon. Casimir stabilized the western and northern borders, tried to regain some of the lost territories, and partially compensated the losses by his new eastern expansion, which placed within his kingdom regions that were ethnically non-Polish.

Despite the territorial truncation Poland experienced a period of accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their increasing role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy. A great monetary reform was implemented during the reign of Casimir III.

[[Image:Władysław I sarcophagus figure.jpg|thumb|right|190 px|[[Władysław I the Elbow-high]], a fragment of his [[sandstone]] sarcophagus]]

[[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław Łokietek]] fought a lifelong uphill battle with powerful adversaries and left the Kingdom in a precarious situation, with limited area under its control and many unresolved issues, but he may have saved Poland's existence as a state. Supported by his [[Hungary|Hungarian]] allies Władysław returned from exile and challenged Wenceslaus in 1304-1305. He took over [[Lesser Poland]] and the lands north of there, through [[Kuyavia]] all the way to [[Gdańsk Pomerania]]. In 1308 Pomerania was conquered by the Brandenburg state. In a recovery effort Łokietek agreed to ask for help the Teutonic Knights; the Knights brutally took over Gdańsk Pomerania and kept it for themselves. In 1313-1314 Władysław conquered [[Greater Poland]]. In 1320 Władysław I Łokietek became the first King of Poland crowned in the [[Wawel Cathedral]], which was agreed to by [[Pope John XXII]], despite the opposition from [[John of Bohemia]], who also claimed the Polish crown. John undertook in 1327 an expedition aimed at Kraków, which he was compelled to abort, and a crusade against Lithuania in 1328, during which he formalized an alliance with the Teutonic Order; the Order was in a state of war with Poland from 1327 to 1332. Władysław was helped by his alliances with Hungary and Lithuania, and from 1329 by a peace agreement with Brandenburg. A lasting achievement of [[John of Bohemia|John of Luxembourg]] (and Poland's greatest loss) was forcing most of the Piast Silesian principalities into [[allegiance]].

After Łokietek's death the old monarch's son, King Casimir III, later to be known as [[Casimir III of Poland|Kazimierz the Great]], was a 23 year old who had no inclination for military life hardships, and by his contemporaries wasn't given much of a chance for overcoming the country's mounting difficulties or succeeding as a leader. But from the beginning Casimir acted prudently, purchasing in 1335 John's claims to the Polish throne, and  after a couple of high-level arbitrations settling in 1343 the disputes with the Teutonic Order by a territorial compromise. At that time Poland started to expand to the east and through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366 Casimir annexed the [[Halych]]-[[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Volodymyr]] area of [[Rus (name)|Rus']]. Supported by Hungary, the Polish king in 1338 promised the Hungarian ruling house the Polish throne in the event he dies without male heirs.

[[Image:Krakow nagrobek Kazimierza W.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Sarcophagus of [[Casimir III of Poland|Kazimierz the Great]] at [[Wawel Cathedral]]]]

Casimir unsuccessfully tried to recover Silesia by conducting military activities against the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourgs]] between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the Gniezno Archdiocese by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. Later until his death he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors had not continued his efforts.

Allied with [[Denmark]] and Western Pomerania (Gdańsk Pomerania was granted to the Order as an "eternal charity") Casimir was able to impose some corrections on the western border. In 1365 [[Drezdenko]] and [[Santok]] became Poland's [[fiefdom|fief]]s, while [[Wałcz]] district was in 1368 taken outright, severing the land connection between Brandenburg and the Teutonic state.

[[Casimir III of Poland|Kazimierz the Great]] considerably strengthened the country's position in both foreign and domestic affairs. Domestically he integrated the reunited Polish state and helped develop what was considered the "Crown of the Polish Kingdom", the state within its actual, as well as past or potential (legal from the Polish point of view) boundaries. Casimir established or strengthened kingdom-wide institutions (such as the powerful state treasury) independent of the regional, class, or royal court related interests. Internationally the Polish king was very active diplomatically, cultivated close contacts with other European rulers and was a staunch defender of the Polish national interest. In 1364 he sponsored the [[Congress of Kraków]], in which a number of monarchs participated, and which was concerned with the promotion of peaceful cooperation and political balance in Central Europe.

Immediately after Casimir's death in 1370, the heirless king's nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]] assumed the Polish throne. As Casimir's actual commitment to the Angevin succession seemed problematic from the beginning, Louis engaged in negotiations with Polish knights and nobility starting already in 1351; they supported him, exacting in return further guarantees and privileges for themselves. Right after the coronation Louis left his mother and Casimir's sister [[Elizabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] in Poland as a [[regent]], himself returning to Hungary.

With the death of [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] the period of hereditary (Piast) monarchy in Poland ended. The land owners and nobles did not want a strong monarchy; a constitutional monarchy was established between 1370 and 1493 (the establishment of the bicameral [[General sejm|General Sejm]]).

[[Image:Jadwiga Andegaweńska.jpg|right|thumb|180 px|[[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]]]

During the reign of Louis I Poland formed a union with Hungary. In the pact of 1374 known as the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] the Polish nobility, granted very extensive concessions, agreed to extend the Angevin succession to Louis' daughters, as Louis also had no sons. This union lasted for twelve years and ended in war. After Louis' death in 1382 and a power struggle that ensued, the Polish nobility decided that Louis' youngest daughter [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] should become the next "King of Poland". Upon their demands Jadwiga arrived in 1384 and was crowned at the age of eleven. The failure of the union of Poland and Hungary paved the way for the union of Lithuania and Poland.

Many large scale [[culture of medieval Poland|brick building]] projects were undertaken in the 14th century, in particular during Casimir's reign. Those included [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches, castles, urban fortifications and homes of wealthy city residents. Most notable are the many magnificent churches representing the [[Polish Gothic]] style; medieval sculpture, painting and ornamental smithery are well represented, especially as the furnishings of churches and liturgical equipment. The Polish law was codified after 1357 and for conflict resolution legal proceedings were being commonly used domestically, while  bilateral or multilateral negotiations and treaties were increasingly important in international relations. The network of cathedral and parish schools became well developed, and in 1364 Casimir the Great, based on a papal concession, established the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]], the second oldest in central Europe. While many still traveled for university studies to southern and western Europe, the [[Old Polish language|Polish language]], along with the predominant [[Latin]], is increasingly present in written documents.

== Jagiellon Era ==
{{main|History of Poland (1385-1569)}}

[[Image:Jogaila (Władysław II).jpg|thumb|right|180 px|[[Jogaila]]]]

In 1385 the [[Union of Krewo]] was signed between Jadwiga and [[Jogaila]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]] (later known as Władysław II Jagiełło), beginning the [[Polish-Lithuanian Union]] and strengthening both nations in their shared opposition to the [[Teutonic Knights]] and the growing threat of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. The Union's intention was to create a common state under King Jagiełło. The idea turned out to be premature at that time (there were going to be territorial disputes and warfare between Poland and [[Lithuania]] or Lithuanian factions), but geographic consequences of the [[personal union]] and the preferences of the [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon]] kings accelerated the process of reorientation of Polish territorial priorities to the east.        

Between 1386 and 1572 Poland and Lithuania were ruled by a succession of constitutional monarchs of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]]. The political influence of the Jagiellon kings was diminishing during this period, which was accompanied by the ever increasing role in central government and national affairs of landed nobility. The royal dynasty however had a stabilizing effect on Poland's politics. The Jagiellon Era is often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great prosperity, and in its later stage the [[Renaissance in Poland|Golden Age of Polish culture]].

The 13th and 14th century feudal rent system, under which each [[estates of the realm|estate]] had well defined rights and obligations, degenerated around the 15th century, as the nobility tightened their control of the production, trade and other economic activities, created many directly owned agricultural enterprises known as [[folwark]]s, limited the rights of the cities and pushed most of the [[peasant]]s into [[serfdom]]. Such practices were increasingly sanctioned by the law. For example the [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]] Privilege of 1496, granted by King [[John I Albert of Poland|Jan Olbracht]], banned rural land purchases by townspeople and severely limited the ability of peasant farmers to leave their villages. Polish towns, lacking national representation protecting their class interests, preserved some degree of self-government (city councils and jury courts), and the trades were able to organize and form [[guilds]]. The nobility soon excused themselves from their principal duty - mandatory military service in case of war ([[pospolite ruszenie]]). The nobility's split into two main layers was institutionalized in the ''[[Nihil novi]]'' "constitution" of 1505, which required the king to consult the [[general sejm|sejm]], that is the senate (highest level officials), as well as the lower chamber of (regional) deputies, before enacting any changes. The masses of ordinary [[szlachta]] competed or tried to compete against the uppermost rank of their class, the [[magnate]]s, for the duration of Poland's independent existence.

[[Image:Battle of Žalgiris.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Battle of Grunwald]]]]
     
The first king of the new dynasty was the Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Jogaila]], or Ladislaus II as the [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]]. He was elected a King of Poland in 1386, after becoming a Christian and marrying [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga of Anjou]], daughter of Louis I, who was [[List of Polish monarchs|Queen of Poland]] in her own right. Christianization of Lithuania followed. Jogaila's rivalry in Lithuania with his cousin [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]] was settled in 1401 in the [[Union of Vilnius and Radom]]. Vytautas became the Grand Duke of Lithuania for life under Jogaila's nominal supremacy, but the agreement made possible close cooperation between the two nations, necessary to succeed in the upcoming struggle with the Teutonic Order. The campaign of summer of 1410 included the [[Battle of Grunwald]], where the Polish and Lithuanian-Rus' armies completely defeated the Teutonic Knights. The offensive that followed lost its impact with the ineffective siege of [[Malbork Castle|Malbork]]. The failure to take the fortress and eliminate the Teutonic (later [[Duchy of Prussia|Prussia]]n) state had for Poland dire historic consequences in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. After 1410 there were negotiations and peace deals that didn't hold, more military campaigns and arbitrations. One attempted, unresolved arbitration took place at the [[Council of Constance]]. There in 1415 [[Paulus Vladimiri]], [[rector]] of the [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków Academy]], presented his ''Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor in respect to Infidels'', where he advocated tolerance, criticized the violent conversion methods of the Teutonic Knights, and postulated that pagans have the right to peaceful coexistence with Christians and political independence. This stage of the Polish-Lithuanian conflict with the Teutonic Order ended with the [[Treaty of Melno]] in 1422.

During the [[Hussite Wars]] (1420-1434) Jagiełło, Vytautas and [[Sigismund Korybut]] were invoved in political and military maneuvering concerning the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Czech]] crown, offered by the [[Hussite]]s  first to Jagiełło in 1420. [[Zbigniew Oleśnicki (cardinal)|Zbigniew Oleśnicki]] became known as the leading opponent of a union with the Hussite Czech state.

The Jagiellon dynasty was not entitled to automatic hereditary succession, as each new king had to be approved by nobility consensus. Władysław Jagiełło had two sons late in his life, from his last marriage. In 1430 the nobility agreed to the succession of the future [[Władysław III of Poland|Władysław III]], only after the King gave in and guaranteed the satisfaction of their new demands. In 1434 the old monarch died and his minor son Władysław was crowned; the Royal Council led by Bishop Oleśnicki undertook the regency duties.

In 1438 the Czech anti-[[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] opposition, mainly Hussite factions, offered the Czech crown to Jagiełło's younger son [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir]]. The idea, accepted in Poland over Oleśnicki's objections, resulted in two unsuccessful Polish military expeditions to [[Bohemia]]. 

After Vytautas' death in 1430 Lithuania became embroiled in internal wars and conflicts with Poland. Casimir sent as a boy by King Władysław on a mission there in 1440, was surprisingly proclaimed a Grand Duke of Lithuania, and stayed in Lithuania.

Oleśnicki gained the upper hand again and pursued his long-term objective of Poland's union with [[Hungary]]. At that  time [[Turkey]] embarked on a new round of European conquests and threatened Hungary, which needed the powerful Polish-Lithuanian ally. Władysław III in 1440 assumed also the Hungarian throne. Influenced by [[Julian Cesarini]], the young king led the Hungarian army against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1443 and again in 1444. Like his mentor, [[Władysław III of Poland|Władysław Warneńczyk]] was killed at the [[Battle of Varna]].

Beginning toward the end of Jagiełło's life, Poland was practically governed by a magnate oligarchy led by Oleśnicki. The rule of the dignitaries was actively opposed by various szlachta groups. Their leader [[Spytek of Melsztyn]] was killed during an armed confrontation in 1439, which allowed Oleśnicki to purge Poland of the remaining Hussite sympathizers and pursue his other objectives without significant opposition.

[[Image:Casimir_IV_Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]]]]

In 1445 [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir]], the Grand Duke of Lithuania, was asked to assume the Polish throne vacated by the death of his brother Władysław. Casimir was a tough negotiator and did not accept the Polish  nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 on his terms. Becoming a King of Poland Casimir also freed himself from the control the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the [[Vilnius]] Privilege of 1447 he declared the Lithuanian nobility having equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Kazimierz Jagiellończyk]] was able to remove from power [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Oleśnicki and his group, basing his own power on the younger middle nobility camp instead. A conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions Casimir also resolved in his favor.
                                
In 1454 the [[Prussian Confederation]], an alliance of Prussian cities opposed to the rule of the Teutonic Knights, asked King Casimir to take over Prussia and stirred up an armed uprising against the Knights. Casimir declared a war on the Order and a formal incorporation of Prussia into the Polish Crown; those events led to the [[Thirteen Years War]]. The weakness of [[pospolite ruszenie]] (the [[szlachta]] wouldn't cooperate without new across-the-board concessions from Casimir) prevented a takeover of all of Prussia, but in the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]] the Knights had to surrender the western half of their territory to the Polish crown (the areas known afterwards as [[Royal Prussia]]), and to accept Polish-Lithuanian [[suzerainty]] over the remainder (the later [[Duchy of Prussia|Ducal Prussia]]). Poland regained [[Gdańsk Pomerania]] and with it the all-important access to the [[Baltic Sea]]. Other 15th century Polish territorial gains or rather revindications included the [[Duchy of Oświęcim]] and [[Duchy of Zator]] on [[Silesia]]'s border with [[Lesser Poland]], and there was notable progress regarding the incorporation of the Piast [[Masovia]]n duchies into the Crown.

The southern and eastern outskirts of Poland and Lithuania became threatened by [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish invasions]] beginning in the late 15th century. In 1485 King Casimir undertook an expedition into [[Moldavia]], after its seaports were overrun by the Ottoman Turks. The Turkey controlled [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] raided the eastern lands in 1482 and 1487, when they were confronted there by King [[John I Albert of Poland|Jan Olbracht]], Casimir's son and successor. Poland was attacked in 1487-1491 by the remains of the [[Golden Horde]]. They reached as far as [[Lublin]] before being beaten at Zaslavl.<ref>[http://www.strangelove.net/~kieser/Russia/foreigninteractionC.html Russian Interaction with Foreign Lands]</ref> King [[John I Albert of Poland|John Albert]] in 1497 made an attempt to resolve the Turkish problem militarily, but his efforts were unsuccessful as he was unable to secure effective participation in the war by his brothers, King [[Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]] and [[Alexander Jagiellon|Alexander]], the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and because of the resistance on the part of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], the ruler of Moldavia. More [[Ottoman Empire]] instigated destructive [[Tatar invasions|Tatar raids]] took place in 1498, 1499 and 1500.<ref>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/russia/milxcrimeantatars.html List of Wars of the Crimean Tatars]</ref> John Albert's diplomatic peace efforts that followed were finalized after the king's death in 1503, resulting in a territorial compromise and an unstable truce.

Lithuania was increasingly threatened by the growing power of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. Through the campaigns of 1471, 1492 and 1500 Moscow took over much of Lithuania's eastern possessions. The Grand Duke Alexander was elected King of Poland in 1501 after the death of John Albert. In 1506 he was succeeded by [[Sigismund I the Old]] in both Poland and Lithuania, as the political realities were drawing the two states closer together. Prior to that Sigismund had been a Duke of [[Silesia]] by the authority of his brother [[Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus II]], but like other Jagiellon rulers before him he had not pursued the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]]'s claim to Silesia.

The [[culture of medieval Poland|culture of the 15th century Poland]] was still mostly medieval. Under favorable social and economic conditions the crafts and industries in existence already in the preceding centuries became more highly developed, and their products were much more widespread. Paper production was one of the new industries, and printing developed during the last quarter of the century. Luxurious items were in high demand among the increasingly prosperous nobility, and to a lesser degree among the wealthy town merchants. Brick and stone residential buildings became common, but only in cities. The mature Gothic style was represented not only in architecture, but also prominently in sacral wooden sculpture, of which the [[altar of Veit Stoss]] is the finest example.

[[Image:Collegium Maius 07.JPG|thumb|230px|The [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]] - ''[[Collegium Maius]]'' courtyard]]

The [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]], which stopped functioning after the death of Casimir the Great, was renewed and rejuvenated around 1400, supported and protected by Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] and the Jagiellon dynasty members, which is reflected in its present name. Europe's oldest department of mathematics and astronomy was established in 1405. Among the university's prominent scholars were [[Stanisław of Skarbimierz]], [[Paulus Vladimiri]] and [[Albert Brudzewski|Albert of Brudzewo]], Copernicus' teacher. The precursors of Polish [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] [[John of Ludzisko]] and [[Gregory of Sanok]] were professors at the university. Scholarly thought elsewhere is represented by [[Jan Ostroróg]], a political publicist and reformist, and [[Jan Długosz]], a historian, whose ''Annals'' is the largest in Europe history work of his time.

The [[folwark]], a [[serfdom]] based large-scale farm and agricultural business, was a dominant feature on Poland's economic landscape beginning in the late 15th century and for the next 300 years. This dependence on nobility-controlled agriculture diverged the ways of central-eastern Europe from those of the western part of the continent, where in contrast elements of [[capitalism]] and [[industrialization]] were developing to a much greater than in the East extent, with the attendant growth of the [[bourgeoisie]] class and its political influence. The combination of the 16th century agricultural trade [[boom and bust|boom]] in Europe, with the free or cheap peasant labor available, made during that period the folwark economy very profitable. 

The 16th century saw also further development of mining and metallurgy and technical progress took place in various commercial applications. Great quantities of exported agricultural and forest products floated down the rivers and transported by land routes resulted in [[balance of trade|positive trade balance]] throughout the 16th century. Imports from the West included industrial and luxury products and fabrics. 

Most of the [[cereal|grain]] exported was leaving Poland through [[Gdańsk]], which because of its location at the terminal point of the [[Vistula]] and its tributaries waterway and of its [[Baltic]] seaport trade role became the wealthiest, most highly developed (by far the largest center of crafts and manufacturing) and most autonomous of the Polish cities. Other towns were negatively affected by Gdańsk's near-monopoly in foreign trade. The largest of them were [[Kraków]], [[Poznań]] and [[Warsaw|Warszawa]], and outside of the Crown, [[Wrocław]]. During the 16th century prosperous [[patricianship|patrician]] families of merchants, bankers, or industrial investors, many of German origin, still conducted large-scale business operations in Europe or lent money to noble interests, including the royal court. Some regions were relatively highly urbanized, for example in [[Greater Poland]] and [[Lesser Poland]] at the end of the 16th century 30% of the population lived in cities. The townspeople's upper layer was ethnically multinational and tended to be well-educated. Numerous burgher sons studied at the [[Jagiellonian University|Academy of Kraków]] and at foreign universities; members of their group are among the finest contributors to the culture of the [[Renaissance in Poland|Polish Renaissance]]. Unable to form their own nationwide political class, many, despite the legal obstacles, melted into the nobility.

The nobility or [[szlachta]] in Poland constituted a greater proportion (up to 10%) of the population, than in other European countries. In principle they were all equal and politically empowered, but some had no property and were not allowed to hold offices, or participate in [[general sejm|sejm]]s or [[sejmik]]s, the legislative bodies. Of the "landed" nobility some possessed a small patch of land which they tended themselves and lived like peasant families (mixed marriages gave some peasants one of the few possible paths to nobility), while the magnates owned dukedom-like networks of estates with several hundred towns and villages and many thousands of subjects. The 16th century Poland was a "republic of nobles", and it was the nobility's "middle class" that formed the leading component during the later Jagiellon period and afterwards, but the magnates held the highest state and church offices. At that time szlachta in Poland and Lithuania was ethnically diversified and belonged to various religious denominations. During this period of tolerance such factors had little bearing on one's economic status or career potential. Jealous of their class privilege ("freedoms"), the Renaissance szlachta developed a sense of public service duties, educated their youth, took keen interest in current trends and affairs and traveled widely. While the [[Renaissance in Poland|Golden Age of Polish Culture]] adopted the western [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] and [[Renaissance]] patterns, the style of the nobles beginning in the second half of the century acquired a distinctly eastern flavor. Visiting foreigners often remarked on the splendor of the residencies and consumption-oriented lifestyle of wealthy Polish nobles.

In a situation analogous with that of other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] ideas and currents. For example there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues such as power and wealth, often corrupt. The middle nobility, which has already been exposed to the [[Hussite]] reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with envy and hostility.

[[Image:Zygmunt1.jpg|thumb|right|180 px|[[Sigismund I the Old]]]]

The teachings of [[Martin Luther]] were accepted most readily in the regions with strong German connections: [[Silesia]], [[Greater Poland]], [[Pomerania]] and [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]. In [[Gdańsk]] in 1525 a lower-class [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] social uprising took place, bloodily subdued by [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I]]; after the reckoning he established a representation for the plebeian interests as a segment of the city government. [[Königsberg]] and the [[Duchy of Prussia]] under [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albrecht Hohenzollern]] became a strong center of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] propaganda dissemination affecting all of northern Poland and Lithuania. Sigismund I quickly reacted against the "religious novelties", issuing his first related edict in 1520, banning any promotion of the Lutheran ideology, or even foreign trips to the Lutheran centers. Such attempted (poorly enforced) prohibitions continued until  1543. Sigismund's son [[Sigismund II Augustus]], a monarch of a much more tolerant attitude, guaranteed the freedom of the Lutheran religion practice in all of [[Royal Prussia]] by 1559. Besides Lutheranism, which, within the Polish Crown, ultimately found substantial following mainly in the cities of Royal Prussia and western Greater Poland, the teachings of the persecuted [[Anabaptist]]s and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], and in Greater Poland the [[Unity of the Brethren|Czech Brothers]], were met, at least among szlachta, with a more sporadic response.

[[Calvinism]] on the other hand in mid 16th century gained many followers among both szlachta and the magnates, especially in [[Lesser Poland]] and Lithuania. The Calvinists proposed the establishment of a Polish national church, under which all Christian denominations would be unified. After 1555 Sigismund II, who accepted their ideas, sent an envoy to the pope, but the papacy rejected the various Calvinist postulates. After 1563-1565 (the abolishment of state enforcement of the Church jurisdiction) full religious tolerance became the norm. The Polish [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] emerged from this critical period weakened, but not badly damaged (the bulk of the Church property was preserved), which facilitated the later success of [[Counter-Reformation]].

Among the Calvinists, who also included the lower classes and their leaders, ministers of common background, disagreements soon developed, based on different views in the areas of religious and social doctrines. The official split took place in 1562, when two separate churches were officially established, the mainstream Calvinist, and the smaller, more reformist, known as the [[Polish Brethren]] or [[Arianism|Arians]]. The adherents of the radical wing of the Polish Brethren promoted, often by way of personal example, the ideas of social justice. Many Arians ([[Piotr of Goniądz]], [[Jan Niemojewski]]) were pacifists opposed to private property, serfdom, state authority and military service; through communal living some had implemented the ideas of shared usage of the land and other property. The notable [[Sandomierz Agreement]] of 1570, an act of compromise and cooperation among several Polish Protestant denominations, excluded the Arians, whose more moderate, larger faction toward the end of the century gained the upper hand within the movement. 

The act of the [[Warsaw Confederation]], which took place during the [[convocation sejm]] of 1573, provided guarantees, at least for the nobility, of religious freedom and peace. It gave the Protestant denominations, including the Polish Brethren, formal rights for many decades to come. Uniquely in 16th century Europe, it turned the Commonwealth, in the words of Cardinal [[Stanislaus Hosius|Stanisław Hozjusz]], a Catholic reformer, into a "safe haven for heretics".

[[Image:Krakow 2006 080.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|[[Wawel Castle]] Renaissance courtyard]]

The Polish "Golden Age", the 16th century, is most often identified with the rise of the culture of [[Renaissance in Poland|Polish Renaissance]]. As was the case with other European nations, the [[Renaissance]] inspiration came in the first place from [[Italy]]. Many Poles traveled to Italy to study and to learn its culture. As imitating Italian ways became very trendy (the royal courts of the last two Jagiellon kings provided the leadership and example for everybody else), many Italian artists and thinkers were coming to Poland, some settling and working there for many years. While the pioneering Polish [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]], greatly influenced by [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]], accomplished the preliminary assimilation of the [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] culture, the generation that followed was able to put greater emphasis on the development of native elements, and because of its social diversity, advanced the process of national integration.

Beginning in 1473 in Kraków, the printing business kept growing. By the turn of the 16th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth, 8 in [[Kraków]], the rest mostly in [[Gdańsk]], [[Toruń]] and [[Zamość]]. The [[Jagiellonian University|Academy of Kraków]] and Sigismund II possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly common at the noble courts, schools and townspeople's households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as by the end of the century almost every parish ran a school.

The [[Lubrański Academy]], an institution of higher learning, was established in [[Poznań]] in 1519. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] resulted in the establishment of a number of [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]s, academically oriented secondary schools, some of international renown, as the [[Protestant]] denominations wanted to attract supporters by offering high quality education. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] reaction was the creation of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] colleges of comparable quality. The Kraków University in turn responded with [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] program gymnasiums of its own.

[[Image:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|right|180 px|[[Nicolas Copernicus]]]]

The university itself experienced a period of prominence at the turn of the 15th century, when especially the mathematics, astronomy and geography faculties attracted numerous students from abroad. [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and their literatures were likewise popular. By mid 16th century the institution entered a crisis stage, and by early 17th century regressed into [[Counter-reformation]]al conformism. The Jesuits took advantage of the infighting and established in 1579 a [[Vilnius University|university college in Vilnius]], but their efforts aimed at taking over the Academy of Kraków were unsuccessful. Under the circumstances many elected to pursue their studies abroad.
  
[[Sigismund I the Old|Zygmunt I Stary]], who built the presently existing [[Wawel castle|Wawel]] [[Renaissance]] castle, and his son [[Sigismund II Augustus]], supported intellectual and artistic activities and surrounded themselves with the creative elite. Their patronage example was followed by ecclesiastic and lay feudal lords, and by patricians in major towns.

The Polish science reached its culmination in the first half of the 16th century. The medieval point of view was criticized, more rational explanations were attempted. [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]' ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', published in [[Nuremberg]] in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into an understanding of the physical universe, setting free the explosion of scientific inquiry. 

[[Nicolas Copernicus]], a son of a [[Toruń]] trader who moved there from Kraków, exemplifies in his life pursuits Renaissance versatility. His scientific creativity was inspired at the University of Kraków, then at its prime; later he also studied at Italian universities. Copernicus wrote Latin poetry, developed an [[Gresham's law|economic theory]], functioned as a cleric-administrator, political activist in Prussian [[sejmik]]s, led the [[Polish-Teutonic War (1519–1521)|defense of Olsztyn]] against the forces of [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albrecht Hohenzollern]]. He worked on his scientific theory for many years at [[Frombork]], where he died.

[[Maciej Miechowita]], a [[rector]] at the [[Kraków|Cracow]] Academy, wrote ''Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis'', a treatise on the geography of the East, the area in which Polish investigators provided first-hand expertise for the rest of Europe. Later [[Jan Brożek]], another rector, was a multidisciplinary scholar, who  worked on [[number theory]] and promoted Copernicus' work, banned from 1616 by the Church; his anti-Jesuit pamphlet was publicly burned.

[[Image:Sigismund II Augustus.PNG|right|thumb|px 200|[[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon]] king, presided over the [[Union of Lublin]] act]]

[[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] was one of the greatest in Renaissance Europe theorists of political thought. His most famous work, ''On the Improvement of the Commonwealth'', was published in Kraków in 1551. Modrzewski criticized the feudal societal relations and proposed broad realistic reforms. He postulated that all social classes should be subjected to the law to the same degree, and wanted to moderate the existing inequities. Modrzewski, an influential and often translated author, was an passionate proponent of peaceful resolution of international conflicts.

Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of the urban, rather than noble origin.

The modern [[Polish literature]] begins in the 16th century. At that time the nationwide [[Polish language]], common to all educated groups, matured and penetrated all areas of public life, including municipal institutions, the legal code, the Church etc., coexisting for a while with [[Latin]]. [[Klemens Janicki]], one of the early Renaissance Latin language poets, laureate of a papal distinction, was of the peasant origin. Another plebeian author, [[Biernat of Lublin]], wrote in Polish his own version of [[Aesop]]'s fables, permeated with his socially radical views.               

[[Sigismund II Augustus I|Sigismund II]] had no children, thus ending Poland's last hereditary succession.

Poland's [[personal union]] with the [[grand duchy|Grand Duchy]] of Lithuania paved the way for closer relations of the two states. By the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 a unified [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (''[[Rzeczpospolita]]'') was created, stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] mountains to present-day [[Belarus]] and western and central [[Ukraine]] (which earlier had been [[Kievan Rus']] principalities). 

During this period Poland became the home to Europe's largest [[Jewish]] population, as royal edicts guaranteeing Jewish safety and religious freedom, issued during the 13th century ([[Boleslaw the Pious|Bolesław the Pious]], 1264), contrasted with bouts of persecution in Western Europe. This persecution intensified following the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1349, when some in the West blamed the outbreak of the plague on the Jews. Much of Poland was spared from this disease, and Jewish immigration brought their valuable contributions and abilities to the rising state. A royal privilege issued in 1532 granted the Jews freedom to trade anywhere within the kingdom. By the mid-16th century 80% of the world's Jews lived in Poland.<ref>[http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=107 European Jewish Congress - Poland]</ref> The greatest increase in Jewish population occurred in the 18th century, when the Jews constituted up to 7% of the population.

{{main|History of Poland (1569-1795)}}

[[Image:Stefan_Batory_1.PNG|right|thumb|px 200|[[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]] was one of the foreigners [[free election|elected as kings]]]]
 
During the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], in the 16th century, Poland became an [[elective monarchy]], in which the king was elected by the hereditary [[szlachta|nobility]]. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election.

In 1572, the Polish King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] died without any heirs. The political system was not prepared for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate it was determined that the entire nobility of Poland would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather near Warsaw and vote in a “[[free election]]”.

The first such Polish royal election was held in 1573. The four men running for the office were [[Henry III of France|Henri of Valois]] (''Henryk Walezy''), who was the brother of the King of France [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], the Russian Czar [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV the Terrible]], [[Archduke Ernest of Austria|Archduke Ernest]] from the Austrian [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] dynasty, and the King of Sweden, [[John III of Sweden|Johan Vasa III]]. Henri of Valois was the winner in a very disorderly election. But after serving as Polish king for only four months, he received the news that his brother, the King of France, had died. Henri of Valois then abandoned his Polish post and went back to France, where he claimed the throne as [[Henry III of France|Henry III]].

From the 16th century the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth suffered a series of [[Tatar invasions]]. The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people were captured and enslaved during the time of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. 

In 1593, 1626, 1637-1638 and 1648-1654 several [[Cossack]] uprisings took place. The last one led by [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] lasted for six years. As a result of several requests from the Ukrainian [[hetman]] Ukraine was taken under the protection of Russia. The agreement was made in January of 1654 in the city of [[Pereyaslavl]] (Ukraine). This development led to a new Russian-Polish war that lasted from 1654 to 1667. In the end, the parties signed an agreement in the village of Andrusovo near [[Smolensk]], according to which eastern Ukraine now belonged to Russia (with a high degree of local autonomy and an internal army).

The [[Lipka Tatars]] were a noble military caste of the Commonwealth. In the year 1672, the Tatar subjects rose up in open rebellion against the Commonwealth. This was the widely remembered Lipka Rebellion. 

[[Image:Elekcja1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Election of King [[Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki]] on [[Wola]] fields in 1669]]

The elections of kings lasted until the [[Partitions of Poland]]. The elected kings in chronological order were: [[Henry III of France|Henri of Valois]], [[Stefan Batory]], [[Sigismund III Vasa|Zygmunt III Vasa]], [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władyslaw IV Vasa]], [[John II Casimir of Poland|Jan Kazimierz]], [[Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki]], [[John III Sobieski|Jan III Sobieski]], [[Augustus II the Strong]], [[Stanisław Leszczyński]], [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]] and [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]].

Two of the elective kings are more highly regarded than the others. Stefan Batory was determined to reassert the deteriorated royal prerogative, at the cost of alienating the powerful noble families. Jan III Sobieski commanded the allied [[Battle of Vienna|Relief of Vienna]] operation in 1683, which turned out to be the last great victory of the [[Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth|"Republic of Both Nations"]]. Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last of the Polish kings, was a controversial figure. On the one hand he was a driving force behind the substantial and constructive reforms belatedly undertaken by the Commonwealth. On the other, by his weakness and lack of resolve, especially in dealing with imperial Russia, he doomed the reforms together with the country they were supposed to help.

[[Image:Stanislaw Antoni Szczuka (1652 1654-1710).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Stanisław Antoni Szczuka]], a Polish nobleman]] 

The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], following the [[Union of Lublin]], became a counterpoint of sorts to the [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] gaining power in Europe. Its quasi-[[democracy|democratic]] [[political system]] of [[Golden Liberty]], albeit limited to nobility, was mostly unprecedented in the [[history of Europe]].

However the series of power struggles between the lesser nobility ([[szlachta]]), the higher nobility ([[magnate]]s) and [[free election|elected]] [[monarch|kings]] undermined [[citizenship]] values and gradually eroded the [[government]]'s ability to function and its authority. The infamous ''[[liberum veto]]'' procedure was used to paralyze parliamentary proceedings beginning in the second half of the 17th century. After the series of devastating wars in the middle of the 17th century (most notably the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]]) Poland-Lithuania stopped being an influential player in the politics of Europe. During the wars the Commonwealth lost an estimated 1/3 of its population (relatively higher losses than during [[World War II]]). Its [[economic system|economy]] and growth were further damaged by the nobility's reliance on [[agriculture]] and [[serfdom]], which delayed the [[industrialization]] of the country. By the beginning of the 18th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the largest European state, was little more than a pawn of its neighbours (the [[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]) who interfered in its domestic politics almost at will. 

The [[Bar Confederation]] of 1768-1772 was the first in a series of uprisings and wars aimed at preserving Poland's independence, but it was directed not only against Russia, but also against King Stanisław August and his reform camp. The Bar Confederation was quelled and the country was punished with the First [[Partitions of Poland|Partition of Poland]], in which Russia, Prussia and Austria took big chunks of the Commonwealth's territory.

[[Image:Uchwalenie Konstytucji 3 Maja.jpg|thumb|300px|right|In 1791 the "Great" or [[Four-Year Sejm]] adopted the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May 3 Constitution]] at Warsaw's [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]]]]

With the coming of the [[Polish Enlightenment]] in the second half of the 18th century, the movement for reform and revitalization of the country made important gains, culminating in the adoption of the [[Constitution of May 3]], the first modern codified [[constitution]] on the [[Europe]]an continent. However the reforms, which transformed the Commonwealth into a [[constitutional monarchy]], were viewed as dangerous by Poland's neighbours, who didn't want the rebirth of the strong Commonwealth. 

Before the Commonwealth could fully implement and benefit from its reforms, it was [[Polish-Russian War of 1792|invaded in 1792 by Russia]] aided by the local anti-reform alliance of conservative nobility known as the [[Targowica Confederation]]. The ensuing war was not lost, at least not yet, but the King surrendered and the pro-Russian Targowica took over. The Empire responded with the Second Partition nevertheless, in which only Russia and Prussia participated.

In the wake of the 1792 war and the Second Partition a new conspiracy came into being. Among its leaders were both the civilian personalities of the reform movement and military officers of the previous war. The [[Kościuszko Uprising|Kościuszko Rising]] erupted in March of 1794. When it too became extinguished, the three partitioning powers executed the final, or Third Partition, and the Commonwealth ceased to exist.

[[Image:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|right|350px|The [[Partitions of Poland]] of 1772, 1793, and 1795]]

Polish independence ended in a series of [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] (1772, 1793 and 1795) undertaken by [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]]. Russia gained most of the Commonwealth's territory including nearly all of the former [[Lithuania]] (except [[Podlasie]] and lands west of the [[Neman River|Niemen River]]), [[Volhynia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Austria gained the populous southern region henceforth named [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]–[[Lodomeria]], after the Duchy of [[Halych|Halicz]] and [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Volodymyr]]. In 1795 Austria also gained the land between [[Kraków]] and [[Warsaw]], between the [[Vistula River|Vistula]] and [[Pilica River|Pilica]] rivers. Prussia acquired the western lands from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] through [[Greater Poland]] to [[Kraków]], as well as [[Warsaw]] and [[Lithuania]]n territories to the north-east and [[Podlasie]].

Following the [[France|French]] emperor [[Napoleon I]]'s defeat of Prussia, a small Polish state was set up in 1807 under French tutelage as the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].  When [[Polish-Austrian War|Austria was defeated in 1809]], Galicia was added, giving the new state a population of some 3.75 million, a quarter of that of the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]].  Polish nationalists were to remain among the staunchest allies of the French as the tide of war turned against the French, inaugurating a relationship that continues into the present. 

With Napoleon's defeat, the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 converted most of the Duchy of Warsaw into the so-called [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], ruled by the Russian [[tsar]], until the Russian dynasty was deposed from the throne by the Kingdom's Parliament during the [[November Uprising|November Rising]] of 1830/31. After the [[January Uprising|January Rising]] of 1863 the Kingdom was fully integrated into Russia proper. The national uprisings were bloodily subdued by the partitioning powers, which did not extinguish the striving of Polish patriots to regain their independence. The opportunity for freedom appeared only after [[World War I]], when the oppressing states were defeated or weakened by war and revolution.

{{main|History of Poland (1918-1939)}}

[[Image:Jozef Pilsudski5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Józef Piłsudski]]]]
[[World War I]] and the political turbulence that was sweeping Europe in 1914 offered the Polish nation hopes for regaining independence. By the end of World War I Poland had seen the defeat or retreat of all three occupying powers. On the outbreak of war the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of Germany, Austria and Russia, and forced to fight each other in a war that was not theirs. As many Poles sympathized with France and Britain, they found it hard to fight them on the Russian side. They also had little sympathy for the Germans. 

Polish independence was eventually proclaimed on November 3, 1918 and later confirmed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919. The same treaty also gave Poland some territories annexed by the Germans and Austrians during the partitions (see [[Polish Corridor]]). The post-war eastern borders of Poland were determined by Polish victory in the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. According to the British historian [[A.J.P. Taylor]], the Polish-Soviet War "largely determined the course of European history for the next twenty years or more. […] Unavowedly and almost unconsciously, Soviet leaders abandoned the cause of international revolution." It would be twenty years before the Bolsheviks sent their armies abroad to "make revolution".

From the mid 1920s to mid 1930s the Polish government was under the control of [[Józef Piłsudski]], the politically-moderate war hero who had engineered the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|defeat of the Soviet forces]]. Polish independence had boosted the development of culture, but Poland was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]]. The new Polish state had had only 20 years of relative stability and uneasy peace before Poland's neighbours attacked. In 1939, under constant threat from Germany, Poland entered into a full military alliance with Britain and France. In August, Germany and Russia signed a secret agreement concerning the future of Poland, the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].

== World War II ==
{{main|History of Poland (1939-1945)}}

[[Image:Schleswig Holstein firing Gdynia 13.09.1939.jpg|thumb|right|300px|German battleship [[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|''Schleswig-Holstein'']] shelling [[Westerplatte]] on September 1, 1939]]

On August 23, 1939 [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] signed the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov pact|Ribbentrop–Molotov]] non-aggression pact, which secretly provided for the dismemberment of Poland into [[Nazism|Nazi]] and Soviet-controlled zones.  On September 1, 1939 [[Hitler]] ordered his troops into Poland. Poland had signed a pact with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] and the two western powers soon [[declaration of war|declared a war]] on Germany, but remained [[Phoney War|rather inactive]] and extended no aid to the attacked country. On September 17 the Soviet troops moved in and took control of most of the areas of eastern Poland having significant [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] populations under the terms of the German-Soviet agreement. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Poland was completely occupied by German troops.

The Poles formed an underground resistance movement and a [[Polish government in exile]], first in [[Paris]] and later in [[London]], which was recognized by the Soviet Union. During [[World War II]] 400,000 Poles fought under the Soviet command, and 200,000 went into combat on western fronts in units loyal to the Polish government in exile. Many Polish refugee camps were set up, including one in Valdivadé, near [[Kolhapur]] in [[India]]. The camp numbered about 5000 refugees, and the Polish embassy of the government in exile had its office in [[Bombay]]. The camp existed from 1943 to 1948.

In April 1943 the Soviet Union broke relations with the Polish government in exile after the German military announced that they had discovered mass graves of murdered Polish army officers at [[Katyń massacre|Katyń]], in the USSR. The Soviets claimed that the Poles had insulted them by requesting that the [[Red Cross]] investigate these reports. In July 1944 the Soviet [[Red Army]] and the [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Peoples' Army of Poland ]] controlled by the Soviets entered Poland, defeated the Germans (losing 600,000 of their soldiers), and established a communist-controlled "[[Polish Committee of National Liberation]]" in [[Lublin]].

[[Image:Jewish prisones of KZGesiowka liberated by Polish Soldiers of Home Army Warsaw1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Jewish prisoners liberated by Polish soldiers in the beginning of [[Warsaw Uprising]]]]

There was powerful hatred of the Nazis in Warsaw, and there was often resistance, of which the most famous instance was the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of 1944. The uprising, in which most of the Warsaw population participated, was largely instigated by the underground [[Armia Krajowa]], the Home Army. The uprising was planned with the expectation that the Soviet forces, who had arrived in the course of their offensive and were waiting on the other side of the Vistula River in full force, would help in battle over Warsaw. However the Soviets betrayed the Poles, stopping their advance at the Vistula and branding them as criminals on radio broadcasts. For the next two months the Soviets calmly watched as the Nazis brutally suppressed the forces of the pro-western, loyal to the government in exile Polish underground. Historian [[Norman Davies]] has said that to comprehend the numbers killed, one would have to imagine the Twin Towers 9/11 disaster every day for 63 days, and it still wouldn't be enough. After a hopeless surrender on the part of the Poles, the Germans carried out Hitler's order that "there not be two bricks standing" in Warsaw, systematically levelling the city. They retreated only in January 1945 when the Soviets resumed their offensive.

During the war about 6 million Polish citizens were killed by the Germans, and 2.5 million were deported to Germany for forced labour or to extermination camps such as Oświęcim-[[Auschwitz]]. In 1941-1943 Ukrainian nationalists (OUN and [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]) [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia|massacred more than 100,000 Poles in Galicia and Volhynia]]. During 1939-1941 1.45 million people inhabiting Eastern Poland ([[Kresy]]) were deported by the Soviet regime, of whom 63.1% were Poles and 7.4% were Jews. Previously it was believed that about one million Polish citizens died at the hands of the Soviets, however recently Polish historians, based mostly on queries in Soviet archives, estimated the number of deaths at about 350,000.

The Soviet government retained most of the territories captured as a result of the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]] in 1939 (now western [[Ukraine]], western [[Belarus]] and the area around [[Vilnius]]), compensating Poland with parts of [[Silesia]], [[Pomerania]] and southern [[East Prussia]], along with [[Gdańsk]] ("[[Regained Territories]]"), which were granted to [[Poland]]. [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|Most of the German population there was expelled to Germany]].

[[Image:Destroyed Warsaw, capital of Poland, January 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Warsaw]] destroyed, January 1945]]

During World War II over half a million fighting men and women and 6 million civilians (22% of the total population) died. About 50% of these were Polish Christians and other non-Jews and 50% were [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]]. Approximately 5,384,000, or 89.9% of Polish war losses (Jews and Gentiles) were the victims of prisons, death camps, raids, executions, annihilation of ghettos, epidemics, starvation, excessive work and ill treatment. So many Poles were sent to concentration camps that virtually every family had someone close to them who had been tortured or murdered there. 

There were one million war orphans and over half a million war disabled. The country lost 38% of its national assets (Britain lost 0.8%, France lost 1.5%). Half the prewar Poland was expropriated by the Soviet Union, including the two great cultural centres of [[Lwów]] and [[Wilno]]. Many Poles could not return to the country for which they had fought because they belonged to the "wrong" political group, or came from prewar eastern Poland incorporated into the Soviet Union (see [[Repatriation of Poles (1944–1946)]]), or having fought in the West were warned not to return because of the high risk of persecution. Others were arrested, tortured and imprisoned by the Soviet authorities for belonging to the Home Army (see [[Cursed soldiers]]), or persecuted because of having fought on the western front. Although technically "victors", they were not allowed to partake in victory celebrations.

With the Nazis' defeat, as recreated Poland was shifted west to the area between the [[Oder Neisse line|Oder Neisse]] and [[Curzon line]]s, the [[flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|Germans who had not fled were expelled]]. Of those who remained, many chose to [[German exodus from Eastern Europe|emigrate to post-war Germany]]. Ukrainians remaining in Poland were forcibly moved to Soviet Ukraine (see [[Repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union]]), and to new territories in northern and western Poland under [[Operation Wisła]].

== People's Republic of Poland ==
{{main|History of Poland (1945-1989)}}
[[Image:Germany and Poland borders during the 20th century.gif|thumb|right|Map showing the different borders and territories of Poland and Germany during the 20th century, in their three main “incarnations”: [[Russian Empire]]’s [[Congress Poland]]/[[German Empire]], [[Second Polish Republic]]-[[Free City of Danzig]]/[[Weimar Germany]], [[West Germany]]-[[East Germany]]-[[West Berlin]]/[[People's Republic of Poland]] and current Germany/Poland, in dark gray]]

In June 1945, following the February [[Yalta Conference]], a Polish [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] was formed; the [[United States|US]] recognized it the next month. Although the Yalta agreement called for free elections, those held in January 1947 were controlled by the [[PZPR|Communist Party]]. The [[communist]]s then established a regime entirely under their domination. The [[Polish government in exile]] existed until 1990, although its influence was degraded.

In October 1956, after the [[Twentieth Party Congress|20th Soviet Party Congress]] in [[Moscow]] ushered in [[destalinization]] and riots by workers in [[Poznań]] ensued, there was a shakeup in the communist regime. While retaining most traditional communist economic and social aims, the regime of First Secretary [[Władysław Gomułka]] began to liberalize internal Polish life.

In 1965 the [[Polish Episcopal Conference|Conference of Polish Bishops]] issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]]. In 1966 the celebrations of the thousandth anniversary of the [[Baptism of Poland]] led by Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszyński]] and other bishops turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the Polish [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]].  

In 1968 the liberalizing trend was reversed when [[1968 Polish political crisis|student demonstrations were suppressed]] and an [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] campaign initially directed against Gomułka supporters within the party eventually led to the [[1968 Polish political crisis|emigration of much of Poland's remaining Jewish population]]. In August 1968 the [[Polish People's Army]] took part in the infamous [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

In December 1970, [[Polish 1970 protests|disturbances and strikes in the port cities]] of [[Gdańsk]], [[Gdynia]], and [[Szczecin]], triggered by a price increase for essential consumer goods, reflected deep dissatisfaction with living and working conditions in the country. [[Edward Gierek]] replaced Gomułka as First Secretary.

Fueled by large infusions of Western credit, Poland's economic growth rate was one of the world's highest during the first half of the 1970s.  But much of the borrowed capital was misspent, and the centrally [[planned economy]] was unable to use the new resources effectively. The growing debt burden became insupportable in the late 1970s, and economic growth had become negative by 1979.

In October 1978, the [[Archbishop of Kraków]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Karol Józef Wojtyła]], became [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Polish Catholics rejoiced at the elevation of a [[Poles|Pole]] to the [[papacy]] and greeted his June 1979 visit to Poland with an outpouring of emotion.

[[Image:Strike Gdansk 1980.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1980 strike at [[Gdańsk Shipyard]], birthplace of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]]]

On July 1, 1980, with the Polish foreign debt at more than $20 billion, the government made another attempt to increase meat prices. A chain reaction of strikes virtually paralyzed the Baltic coast by the end of August and, for the first time, closed most coal mines in [[Silesia]].  Poland was entering into an extended crisis that would change the course of its future development.

On August 31, 1980, workers at the Lenin Shipyard in [[Gdańsk]], led by an electrician named [[Lech Wałęsa]], signed a 21-point agreement with the government that ended their strike. Similar agreements were signed at [[Szczecin]] and in [[Silesia]]. The key provision of these agreements was the guarantee of the workers’ right to form independent [[trade union]]s and the right to strike. After the Gdańsk agreement was signed, a new national union movement "[[Solidarity]]" swept Poland.

The discontent underlying the strikes was intensified by revelations of widespread corruption and mismanagement within the Polish state and party leadership. In September 1980, Gierek was replaced by [[Stanisław Kania]] as First Secretary.

Alarmed by the rapid deterioration of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]]'s authority following the Gdańsk agreement, the Soviet Union proceeded with a massive military buildup along Poland's border in December 1980. In February 1981, Defense Minister Gen. [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] assumed the position of Prime Minister, and in October 1981, was named First Secretary of the Communist Party. At the first Solidarity national congress in September–October 1981, Lech Wałęsa was elected national chairman of the union.

[[Image:Jaruzelski przemowienie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] declared [[martial law in Poland|martial law]] on December 13, 1981]]

On December 12–13, the regime declared [[martial law]], under which the army and [[ZOMO]] riot police were used to crush the union.  Virtually all Solidarity leaders and many affiliated intellectuals were arrested or detained.  The United States and other Western countries responded to martial law by imposing economic sanctions against the Polish regime and against the Soviet Union. Unrest in Poland continued for several years thereafter.

In a series of slow, uneven steps, the Polish regime rescinded martial law. In December 1982, martial law was suspended, and a small number of political prisoners were released. Although martial law formally ended in July 1983 and a general amnesty was enacted, several hundred political prisoners remained in jail.

In July 1984, another general amnesty was declared, and two years later, the government had released nearly all political prisoners. The authorities continued, however, to harass dissidents and Solidarity activists. Solidarity remained proscribed and its publications banned.  Independent publications were censored.

In late 1980s the government was forced to negotiate with [[Solidarity]] in the [[Polish Roundtable Negotiations]]. The [[Contract Sejm|Polish legislative elections in 1989]] became one of the important events marking the [[fall of communism]] in Poland.

<!-- Merge? At the [[Yalta Conference]] the Allies broadly agreed to the Soviet proposals for Poland's future borders and to reconstitution of the Polish government, which initiated Poland's absorption into the Soviet sphere of influence. A Polish People's Republic (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') was created under communist party rule after a brief period of coalition government.  With the approaching collapse of the [[USSR]], power passed in 1989 to the opposition led by the [[Solidarity]] trade union movement. 

Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of an independent trade union "[[Solidarity]]" (''Solidarność'') that over time became a political force and in 1989–1990 swept elections to both parliament and the presidency, displacing the communist party from government. This lead to the Former known poland as a society free form former communist rule.-->

{{main|History of Poland (1989–present)}}

[[Image:Okragly Stol 1989.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round-table negotiations]] 1989]]

The government's inability to forestall Poland's economic decline led to waves of strikes across the country in April, May and August 1988. The [[Polish Round Table Agreement|"round-table" talks]] with the opposition began in February 1989.  These talks produced an agreement in April for partly-open National Assembly elections. The failure of the communists at the polls produced a political crisis. The round-table agreement called for a communist president, and on July 19, the National Assembly, with the support of a number of Solidarity deputies, elected General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to that office. However, two attempts by the communists to form governments failed.

On August 19, President Jaruzelski asked journalist/Solidarity activist [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] to form a government; on September 12, the [[Sejm]] voted approval of Prime Minister Mazowiecki and his cabinet. For the first time in more than 40 years, Poland had a government led by noncommunists.

In December 1989, the Sejm approved the government's reform program to transform the Polish economy rapidly from centrally planned to free-market, amended the constitution to eliminate references to the "leading role" of the Communist Party, and renamed the country the "Republic of Poland." The [[Polish United Workers Party|Polish United Workers' (Communist) Party]] dissolved itself in January 1990, creating in its place a new party, [[Socjaldemokracja Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej|Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]]. 

In October 1990, the constitution was amended to curtail the term of President Jaruzelski.

In the early 1990s, Poland made great progress towards achieving a fully democratic government and a market economy. In November 1990, Lech Wałęsa was elected President for a 5-year term. In December Wałęsa became the first popularly elected President of Poland. 

Poland's [[Polish parliamentary election, 1991|first free parliamentary elections]] were held in 1991. More than 100 parties participated, and no single party received more than 13% of the total vote. In 1993 [[Polish parliamentary election, 1993|parliamentary elections]] the [[Alliance of the Democratic Left]] (SLD) received the largest share of votes. In 1993 the Soviet [[Northern Group of Forces]] finally left Poland.

In November 1995, Poland held its [[Polish presidential election, 1995|second post-war free presidential elections]]. SLD leader [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] defeated Wałęsa by a narrow margin—51.7% to 48.3%. 

In 1997 [[Polish parliamentary election, 1997|parliamentary elections]] two parties with roots in the Solidarity movement — [[AWS|Solidarity Electoral Action]] (AWS) and the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]] (UW) — won 261 of the 460 seats in the Sejm and formed a coalition government. In April 1997, the first post-communist [[Constitution of Poland]] was finalized, and in July put into effect. 

Poland joined [[NATO]] in 1999. 

In the [[Polish presidential election, 2000|presidential election]] of 2000, [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], the incumbent former leader of the post-communist [[Alliance of the Democratic Left|SLD]], was re-elected in the first round of voting. After [[Polish parliamentary election, 2001|September 2001 parliamentary elections]] SLD (a successor of the communist party ) formed a coalition with the agrarian [[Polish Peasant Party|PSL]] and leftist [[Unia Pracy|UP]].

[[Image:Warsaw22hk.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Warsaw]]]]

Poland joined the [[European Union|EU]] in May 2004. Both President Kwaśniewski and the government were vocal in their support for this cause. The only party decidedly opposed to EU entry was the populist right-wing [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR). 

In the autumn of 2005 Poles voted in both parliamentary and presidential elections. [[Polish parliamentary election, 2005|September's parliamentary poll]] was expected to produce a coalition of two centre-right parties, PiS ([[Law and Justice]]) and PO ([[Civic Platform]]). During the increasingly bitter campaign however, PiS launched a strong attack on the liberal economic policies of their allies and overtook PO in opinion polls. PiS eventually gained 27% of votes cast and became the largest party in the Sejm ahead of PO with 24%. [[Polish presidential election, 2005|Presidential elections in October]] followed a similar script. The early favorite, [[Donald Tusk]], leader of the PO, saw his opinion poll lead slip away and was beaten 54% to 46% in the second round by the PiS candidate [[Lech Kaczyński]] (one of the twins, founders of the party). 
Coalition talks ensued simultaneously with the presidential elections. However, the severity of the campaign attacks had soured the relationship between the two largest parties and made the creation of a stable coalition impossible. The ostensible stumbling blocks were the insistence of PiS that it controls all aspects of law enforcement: the Ministries of Justice and Internal Affairs, and the special forces; as well as the forcing through of a PiS candidate for the head of the [[Sejm]] with the help of several smaller populist parties. PO also wanted to control the law enforcement and the situation ended up in the stalemate. The PO decided to go into opposition. PiS then formed a minority government which relied on the support of smaller populist and agrarian parties ([[Samoobrona]], [[Liga Polskich Rodzin|LPR]]) to govern. This became a formal coalition, but its deteriorating state made early parliamentary elections necessary. 

After the 2007 parliamentary elections the government of [[Donald Tusk]], the chairman of PO was formed. The current government is made of two parties, PO and the peasants' party, [[Polish People's Party|PSL]].
