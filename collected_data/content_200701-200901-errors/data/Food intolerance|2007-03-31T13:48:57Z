'''Food intolerance''' or '''food sensitivity''' is a negative reaction to a food that may or may not be related to the [[immune system]] or to [[food poisoning]]. It is caused by the absence of specific chemicals or [[enzymes]] needed to digest a food substance. 

Symptoms of food intolerance vary greatly, and can be mistaken for the symptoms of an [[Food allergy|allergy]]. Whilst true allergies are associated with fast-acting immunoglobulin IgE responses, it can be difficult to determine the offending food causing an intolerance because if the immune system is involved, the response is likely to be IgG mediated and takes place over a prolonged period of time. Thus the causative agent and the response are separated in time, and may not be obviously related.  A deficiency in digestive enzymes can also cause some types of food intolerances. [[Lactose intolerance]] is a result of the body not producing enough [[lactase]] used to break down the [[lactose]] in milk. [[Gluten intolerance]] results in damage to [[villi]] in the [[small intestine]], which makes it difficult for the body to absorb water and nutrients from foods.

Symptoms of a food intolerance include [[gas]], intermittent [[diarrhea]], [[constipation]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[skin rashes]], [[migraine]] headaches, and an unproductive [[cough]].
