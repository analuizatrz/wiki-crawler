'''Film colorization''', '''film colourisation''', '''film colourization''' or '''film colorisation''' is any process that involves adding [[color]] to [[black and white]], sepia or monochrome moving-picture images.  The earliest examples date back to the early 20th century, but it has become more practical and more common since the development of digital image processing. 

It has been done with different effects for various reasons, including as a special effect or as a form of restoration for color films. The process has also garnered controversy because of its use to reissue black and white films and television shows in color. Some have claimed that this use of the process is a form of "cultural vandalism".<ref name="Time">{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963207,00.html |title=Casablanca In Color? |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 12, 1987 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] |pages=3 |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

==Techniques==
During the late 1950s and the 1960s, black and white [[Animated cartoon|cartoons]] were redistributed in color—the colorization process was done by tracing the original black and white frames onto new animation cels, and then adding color to the new cels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cztoondb.tripod.com/cztoondb/laddqaart.htm |title=The colorized cartoon database |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> With computer technology, studios were able to add color to black and white films by digitally tinting single objects in each frame of the film until it was fully colorized. The initial process was invented by [[Canada|Canadians]] [[Wilson Markle]] and [[Brian Hunt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blmotionpictures.htm |title=The History of the Motion Picture |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=About.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and was first used in 1970 to add color to monochrome footage of the moon from the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] mission.

Colorization typically begins with a monochrome film print. From the film print, a high quality videotape copy is made. Technicians, aided by a computer, identify the grey level of every object in every shot and note any movement of objects within shots. A computer adds color to each object, while keeping grey levels the same as in the monochrome original.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colorization/colorization.htm |title=COLORIZATION |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> This technique was patented in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://patents1.ic.gc.ca/details?patent_number=01291260&language=EN_CA  |title=Canadian Intellectual Property Office |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>
[[Image:Timebrushed_sample_psycho.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sample of a frame colourized using the Timebrush process.]] 

Movies colorized using early techniques have softer contrast and fairly pale, flat, washed out color. However, the technology has improved since the 1980s, and several black and white TV shows and films have been given what some viewers find to be a completely lifelike colorization.

A major difficulty with colorization has been its labor-intensiveness. For example, in order to colorize a still image an artist typically begins by dividing the image into regions, and then proceeds to assign a color to each region. This approach, also known as the segmentation method, is time consuming and requires a great deal of painstaking work on dividing the picture into correct segments. This problem occurs mainly since there have historically been no fully automatic algorithms that always identify correctly fuzzy or complex region boundaries, such as between a subject’s hair and face.  
    
Colorization of moving images also requires tracking regions as movement occurs across the frames of a particular scene. There are several companies that claim automatic region-tracking algorithms, the most recent is [[Legend Films]], a company that describes their core technology as pattern recognition and background compositing which moves and morphs foreground and background masks from frame to frame.  In the process, backgrounds are colorized separately in a single composite frame that functions as a visual database of a cut that includes all offset data on all camera movement. Once the foregrounds are colorized the background masks are applied frame to frame in a utility process.

A noteable and newer technique is the proprietary Timebrush process. Based on Neural Net technology, Timebrush colorization produces saturated and crisp colors with clear lines and no apparent spill overs. The process is also cost effective and equally suitable for low budget colorization, as well as for prime time broadcast quality or theatrical projection.

Another company using a computer-assisted method for colorizing was developed by a team of researchers at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]'s Benin School of Computer Science and Engineering. The new method is an interactive process that does not require precise, manual, region detection, nor accurate tracking and is based on the simple premise that nearby pixels in space and time that have similar grey levels should also have similar colors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isracast.com/tech_news/270405_tech.htm |title=REVOLUTIONARY COMPUTER COLORING METHOD FOR BLACK AND WHITE SCENES DEVELOPED AT THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

==Partial colorization==
[[Image:Handschiegel.JPG|thumb|right|Digital recreation of the ''Handschiegel'' process.]]
The earliest form of colorization introduced limited color into a black and white film using dyes, as a visual effect.  The earliest Edison films, most notably the ''Anabelle Butterfly Dance'' series were also the earliest examples of colorization, done by painting [[aniline]] dyes onto the emulsion.

By around 1905, [[Pathé]] introduced ''Pathéchome'', a stencil process that involved cutting glass stencils for each frame with a [[pantograph]].

In 1916, the [[Handschiegl Color Process]] was invented for the film, ''Joan the Woman'' (1917).  Another early example of the Handschiegl process can be found in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925), in which [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s character can be seen wearing a bright-red cape while the rest of the scene remained monochrome.  The scene was toned sepia, and then the cape was painted red, either by stencil or by matrix. Then, a sufur solution was applied to everything but the dyed parts, turning the sepia into blue tone. The process was named after its inventor, Max Handschiegl.  This effect, as well as a missing color sequence, were recreated in 1996 for a Photoplay Productions restoration by computer colorization (see below).

Partial colorization has also been utilized on footage shot in color to enhance commercials and broadcast televsion to further facilitate the directors artistic vision. As an example, Cerulean Fx provided partial colorization for [[ The Dave Matthews Band ]] music video [[The Space Between]].[[Image:TheDaveMatthewsBandSpaceBetween.jpg]]

==Restoration==
{{Sectstub}}
A number of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] shows which were made in color in the early 1970s were [[wiping (magnetic tape)|wiped]] for economic reasons, but in some cases black and white [[telerecording]]s were made for export to countries that did not yet have color television. A notable example is the [[BBC]]'s 5-part ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Dæmons]]''. Only one episode survived in color; the rest existed only as black and white film recordings. The only known color recording was a poor quality off-air recording of an abridged American broadcast. In the 1990s the BBC colorized the black and white copies by adding the color signal from the off-air recordings. The result was judged a success by both technicians and fans and it is widely rumoured that more sophisticated colorization technology will be used to restore other ''Doctor Who'' episodes as well as shows like ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' where some episodes only exist in black and white. However, there are no plans to use colorization on BBC programs originally made in black and white.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.restoration-team.co.uk/ |title=Doctor Who Restoration Team Official Site |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

==Integration==
{{Sectstub}}
Colorization is also sometimes used on historical [[stock footage]] in color movies. For instance, the film ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' uses colorized news footage from the time of the [[Cuban missile crisis]] of 1962.

The full-color feature film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'' (2004), which already made heavy use of digitally-generated sets and objects, integrated black and white 1940s footage of Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] into scenes by colorizing him.

In his feature film, ''[[The Aviator]]'' (2005), Martin Scorcese seamlessly blendeded colorized stock footage of the ''[[Hells Angels]]'' movie premiere with footage of the premiere reinactment.  The colorization was designed to look like normal three-strip film but was then color corrected to match the two-strip look of the premiere reinactment.  Also in ''[[The Aviator]]'', Scorsese used colorized footage of [[Jane Russell]] from the original black and white film, ''[[The Outlaw]]'' and dog fight scenes from ''[[Hells Angels]]''.

[[Image:Casablanca (colorized).jpg|right|thumb|The colorization of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' was an extremely controversial decision.]]
In the mid-1980s, the process drew considerable controversy when ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'' became the first black and white film to be redistributed in color using the colorization process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0029682/trivia |title=Trivia for ''Topper'' |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Defenders of the process noted that it would allow black and white films to have new audiences of people who were not used to the format. Detractors complained that the process was crude and claimed that even if it were refined, it would not take into account [[lighting]] compositions chosen for black and white [[photography]] which would not necessarily be as effective in color.<ref name="Time">{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963207,00.html |title=Casablanca In Color? |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 12, 1987 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] |pages=3 |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>  They also cited creative decisions that the original director might not approve of, such as the visual pun of the character Violet in ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' wearing violet.  Thus they argued, the original work of the artists involved is damaged.

[[Media mogul]] [[Ted Turner]] was once a particularly aggressive proponent of this process. When he told members of the press that he was considering colorizing ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', his comments led to an immediate public outcry. Welles had retained control over the film in his original contract, which would prevent any editing or other tampering with this film, without the express permission of Welles or his estate. Turner Pictures had never actually announced that this was an upcoming planned project. Turner himself later stated that this was a joke designed to needle colorization critics, and that he never had any intention of colorizing the film. Partially due to this controversy, all films shown on American television or released to [[home video]] in an altered format (including [[pan and scan]] and "edited for television" versions), must now display a disclaimer indicating that the film "has been modified from its original version."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0033467/trivia |title=Trivia for ''Citizen Kane'' |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

By the mid-1990s, the colorization controversy had died out. Because of the high cost of the process, Turner Entertainment stopped colorizing titles. With the coming of [[DVD]] technology, the notion of colorization was once again gaining press. Because the DVD format was more versatile, studios could offer viewers the option to choose between both versions without switching discs, and thus, the release of colorized titles once again seemed profitable. Some companies re-released the older colorized versions from the 1980s—an example of this is the [[Laurel and Hardy]] box set being released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReviews16/laurel_and_hardy_collection_dvd_review.htm |title=The Laurel and Hardy Collection |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=DVD Beaver |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Other studios, such as [[Sony|Sony Entertainment]], commissioned new color versions. A recent release that garnered much controversy was a set of [[Three Stooges]] DVDs featuring new colorized versions prepared by [[West Wing Studios]], using the latest colorization technology. The studio was given access to the original props, sets, etc. in order to do research for the colorized versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5651949/ |title=Stooges DVD revives colorization debate |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Film colorization is also done by the company [[Legend Films]]. Their patented process was used to colorize around 100 films between 2003 and 2007.  [[Shirley Temple Black]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Terry Moore]] and [[Ray Harryhausen]] have worked with the company to colorize either their own films or their personal favorites. Two movies that Lengend Films are noted for is the colorization of the exploitation film ''[[Reefer Madness]]'', for which certain color schemes were used to create a psychedelic effect in its viewers, and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', widely known as "the worst movie ever made."

In 2005,[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]who released the first season of ''[[Bewitched]]'' on DVD. Because the first season was produced in black and white, Sony released two versions of the set: one with the episodes as originally broadcast and a second with the episodes colorized. A year later, the second season of ''Bewitched'' and the first season of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', another show owned by Sony, were released the same way. [[ West Wing Studios]]
was the colorization house utilized by the[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] releases.

== Documentary make-overs ==
{{Sectstub}}
Colorization is sometimes used on [[Documentary film|documentary]] programmes. ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' TV show colorizes some footage of the band, most notably the performance of "[[All You Need Is Love]]" from the TV special ''[[Our World]]'' (1967). In the documentary this scene begins in its original black and white before [[Dissolve (film)|dissolving]] into seemingly realistic, [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesagain.com/breflib/anthvid.html |title=Anthology Home Video |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Beatles Reference Library |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> In this case the color design was based on stills taken at the same time, so in a sense the color is "real", yet the use of artificial color in a documentary could also be regarded as misleading or even fraudulent.

The documentary series ''[[World War I in Color]]'' (2003) was broadcast on television and released on DVD in 2005. There had previously been full-color documentaries about [[World War II]] using genuine color footage, but since true color film was not practical for moving pictures at the time of [[World War I]], the series consists of colorized contemporary footage (and photographs).

The 1960 [[Augusta Masters Tournament]], originally broadcast in black and white and recorded on kinescope will be re-broadcast on CBS, Sunday April 8th, 2007 before the final round of the 2007 Augusta Masters Tournament.  The documentary, ''[[Jim Nantz Remembers]]'' is the first time a major sports event has been re-broadcast using colorization, with additional commentary by [[Arnold Palmer]].
