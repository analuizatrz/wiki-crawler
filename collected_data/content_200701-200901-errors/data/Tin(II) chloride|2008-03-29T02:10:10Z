'''Tin(II) chloride''' (stannous chloride) is a white [[crystal]]line solid with the formula {{Tin}}{{Chlorine}}<sub>2</sub>.  It forms a stable dihydrate, but [[aqueous]] solutions tend to undergo [[hydrolysis]], particularly if hot.  SnCl<sub>2</sub> is widely used as a [[Redox|reducing agent]] (in acid solution), and in [[Electrolysis|electrolytic]] baths for [[Electroplating|tin-plating]].  Tin(II) chloride should not be confused with the other chloride of tin; [[tin(IV) chloride]] or stannic chloride (SnCl<sub>4</sub>). 

==Chemical structure==
SnCl<sub>2</sub> has a [[lone pair]] of [[electron]]s, such that the molecule in the gas phase is bent.  In the solid state, crystalline SnCl<sub>2</sub> forms chains linked via [[chloride]] bridges as shown.  The dihydrate is also three-coordinate, with one water coordinated on to the tin, and a second water coordinated to the first.  The main part of the molecule stacks into double layers in the [[crystal lattice]], with the "second" water sandwiched between the layers.

==Chemical properties==
Tin(II) chloride can dissolve in less than its own mass of water without apparent decomposition, but as the solution is diluted hydrolysis occurs to form an insoluble basic salt: 

:SnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ↔ Sn(OH)Cl(s) + HCl(aq)
<!-- wrote out equation for consistency -->
<!--
[[Image:SnCl2 hydrolysis.png|300px]]
-->

Therefore if clear solutions of tin(II) chloride are to be used, [[hydrochloric acid]] must be added in order to maintain the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] towards the left-hand side (using [[Le Chatelier's principle]]).  Solutions of  SnCl<sub>2</sub> are also unstable towards [[Redox|oxidation]] by the air:

:6 SnCl<sub>2</sub>([[Aqueous|aq]])  +  [[Oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]]([[Gas|g]])  +  2 [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]([[Liquid|l]])  →  2 [[Tin(IV) chloride|SnCl<sub>4</sub>]](aq)  +  4 Sn(OH)Cl([[Solid|s]])

This can be prevented by storing the solution over lumps of tin metal.<ref>{{cite book | author = H. Nechamkin | title = The Chemistry of the Elements | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 1968}}</ref>

There are many such cases where tin(II) chloride acts as a reducing agent, reducing [[silver]] and [[gold]] salts to the metal, and iron(III) salts to iron(II), for example:

:SnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq)  +  2 [[Iron(III) chloride|FeCl<sub>3</sub>]](aq)  →  [[Tin(IV) chloride|SnCl<sub>4</sub>]](aq)  + 2 [[Iron(II) chloride|FeCl<sub>2</sub>]](aq)

Solutions of tin(II) chloride can also serve simply as a source of Sn<sup>2+</sup> ions, which can form other tin(II) compounds via [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] reactions, for example brown (or black) tin(II) sulfide:

:SnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq)  +  [[sodium sulfide|Na<sub>2</sub>S]](aq)  →  SnS(s)  +  2 [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]](aq)

If [[alkali]] is added to a solution of SnCl<sub>2</sub>, a white precipitate of hydrated [[tin(II) oxide]] forms initially; this then dissolves in excess base to form a stannite salt such as sodium stannite:

:SnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq)  +  2 [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]](aq)  →  SnO·H<sub>2</sub>O(s)  +  2 [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]](aq)

:SnO·H<sub>2</sub>O(s)  +  NaOH(aq)  →  NaSn(OH)<sub>3</sub>(aq)

Anhydrous SnCl<sub>2</sub> can be used to make a variety of interesting tin(II) compounds in non-aqueous solvents.  For example, the [[lithium]] [[salt]] of [[BHT|4-methyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol]] reacts with SnCl<sub>2</sub> in [[Tetrahydrofuran|THF]] to give the yellow linear two-coordinate compound Sn(OAr)<sub>2</sub> (Ar = [[aryl]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author = B. Cetinkaya, I. Gumrukcu, M. F. Lappert, J. L. Atwood, R. D. Rogers and M. J. Zaworotko | title = Bivalent germanium, tin, and lead 2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxides and the crystal and molecular structures of M(OC6H2Me-4-But2-2,6)2 (M = Ge or Sn) | year = 1980 | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 102 | issue = 6 | pages = 2088-2089 | doi = 10.1021/ja00526a054}}</ref>

Tin(II) chloride also behaves as a [[Lewis acid]], forming [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] with [[ligand]]s such as [[chloride]] ion, for example:

:SnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq)  +  [[Caesium chloride|CsCl]](aq)  →  CsSnCl<sub>3</sub>(aq)

Most of these complexes are [[pyramidal]], and since complexes such as SnCl<sub>3</sub> have a full [[Octet rule|octet]], there is little tendency to add more than one ligand.   The [[lone pair]] of electrons in such complexes is available for bonding, however, and therefore the complex itself can act as a [[Lewis base]] or ligand. This seen in the [[ferrocene]]-related product of the following reaction :

:SnCl<sub>2</sub>  +  Fe(η<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>HgCl   →  Fe(η<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>SnCl<sub>3</sub>  +  {{Mercury}}

SnCl<sub>2</sub> can be used to make a variety of such compounds containing metal-metal bonds, for example:

:SnCl<sub>2</sub>  +  [[Dicobalt octacarbonyl|Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>]]  →  (CO)<sub>4</sub>Co-(SnCl<sub>2</sub>)-Co(CO)<sub>4</sub>

==Preparation==
Anhydrous SnCl<sub>2</sub> is prepared by the action of dry [[hydrogen chloride]] gas on [[tin]] metal.  The dihydrate is made by a similar reaction, using [[hydrochloric acid]]:

:[[Tin|Sn]]([[Solid|s]])  +  2 [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]]([[Aqueous|aq]])  →  SnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq)  +  [[Hydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]]([[Gas|g]])

The water is then carefully evaporated from the acidic solution to produce crystals of SnCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O.  This dihydrate can be [[dehydration reaction|dehydrated]] to anhydrous using [[acetic anhydride]].

==Uses==
A solution of tin(II) chloride containing a little [[hydrochloric acid]] is used for the [[Electroplating|tin-plating]] of steel, in order to make [[tin can]]s. An electric potential is applied, and [[tin]] metal is formed at the [[Electrode|cathode]] via [[electrolysis]]. 

It is used as a catalyst in the production of the plastic [[polylactic acid]] (PLA).

Tin(II) chloride also finds wide use as a [[Redox|reducing agent]].  This is seen in its use for silvering mirrors, where [[silver]] metal is deposited on the glass:

:Sn<sup>2+</sup>(aq)  +  2 Ag<sup>+</sup>  →  Sn<sup>4+</sup>(aq)  +  2 {{Silver}}(s)

A related reduction was traditionally used as an analytical test for {{Mercury}}<sup>2+</sup>(aq).  For example, if SnCl<sub>2</sub> is added [[Wiktionary|dropwise]] into a solution of [[mercury(II) chloride]], a white precipitate of [[mercury(I) chloride]] is first formed; as more SnCl<sub>2</sub> is added this turns black as metallic mercury is formed.  Stannous chloride can be used to test for the presence of [[gold]] [[chemical compound|compounds]]. SnCl<sub>2</sub> turns bright [[violet (color)|purple]] in the presence of gold.

This very reaction between stannous chloride and gold was used in episode #215:[[Clueless (House episode)|Clueless]] of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' to affirm gold poisoning.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

In [[organic chemistry]], SnCl<sub>2</sub> is mainly used in the [[Stephen reduction]], whereby a [[nitrile]] is reduced (via an [[imidoyl chloride]] salt) to an [[imine]] which is easily hydrolysed to an [[aldehyde]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | title = &beta;-Naphthaldehyde | author = Williams, J. W. | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 626 | year = 1955 | prep = cv3p0626}}</ref>

The reaction usually works best with [[aromaticity|aromatic]] nitriles [[Aryl]]-CN. A related reaction (called the Sonn-Müller method) starts with an amide, which is treated with [[Phosphorus pentachloride|PCl<sub>5</sub>]] to form the imidoyl chloride salt.

[[Image:SnCl2 Stephen reduction.png|center|500px|The Stephen reduction]]

The Stephen reduction is less used today, because it has been mostly superseded by [[diisobutylaluminium hydride]] reduction.

Additionally, SnCl<sub>2</sub> is used to selectively reduce [[aromatic]] [[nitro]] groups to [[aniline]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = F. D. Bellamy and K. Ou | title = Selective reduction of aromatic nitro compounds with stannous chloride in non acidic and non aqueous medium | year = 1984 | journal = [[Tetrahedron Letters]] | volume = 25 | issue = 8 | pages = 839-842 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(01)80041-1}}</ref>

[[Image:SnCl2 Nitro Reduction Scheme.png|center|350px|Aromatic nitro group reduction using SnCl<sub>2</sub>]]

SnCl<sub>2</sub> also reduces [[quinone]]s to [[hydroquinone]]s.

Stannous chloride is also added as a [[food additive]] with [[E number]] '''E512''' to some canned and bottled foods, where it serves as a color-retention agent and [[antioxidant]].

==In popular culture==
This compound was featured in the ''[[House (TV series)|House, M.D.]]'' episode “[[Clueless (House episode)|Clueless]],” wherein it was used to detect the presence of [[Sodium aurothiomalate|gold sodium thiomalate]] used by the patient’s wife to poison him.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}
