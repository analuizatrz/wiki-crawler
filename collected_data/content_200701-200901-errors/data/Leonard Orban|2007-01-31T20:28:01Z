Orban is the first to hold this portfolio.

Politically, the portfolio is mainly focused on promoting [[language learning|foreign languages learning]] as means for [[labour mobility|worker’s mobility]] and business [[competitiveness]] rather than emphasizing [[language rights]] of speakers of [[Regional language|regional]], [[Minority language|minority]], lesser-used and migrant languages.

Administratively, Orban is in charge of the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]], the [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|DG for Interpretation]] and the [[Publications Office (European Union)|Office for Official Publications of the EU departments]], as well as for the Multilingualism policy unit (EAC-C-5) in the [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture (European Commission)|DG for Education and Culture]], with 3,400 staff in total - about 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce- and with about 1 percent of the [[EU budget]].

Orban is also assisted by a cabinet of 13 members. French Patricia Bugnot is head of cabinet and German Jochen Richter as deputy head. It does not include any natively [[anglophone]] member.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/staffdir/plsql/gsys_www.guide?pLang=EN&pId=577  Cabinet of Commissioner Leonard Orban - Multilingualism], ''European Commission Directory''.

==Appointment procedure==
[[Image:Leonard Orban Hearing European Parliament..jpg|thumb|right|220px|Orban hearing before the [[European Parliament]], [[27 November]] [[2006]]]]
According to Article 45 of the protocol to the [[Treaty of Accession 2005|Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania]] the new Members of the Commission representing the acceding member states would be appointed by the [[Council of the European Union]], by common accord with the [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]] and after consulting the [[European Parliament]].<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_157/l_15720050621en00290045.pdf Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania], ''Official Journal L 157 of 21 June 2005''. Retrieved on [[January 28]], [[2007]].</ref> Compared to [[Enlargement of the European Union|former enlargements]], the Accession Treaty for Bulgaria and Romania for the first time explicitly foresees the consultation of the European Parliament and constitutes the formal legal basis for the new Commissioners’ appointment procedure.

In [[October 30]], [[2006]], the Romanian government proposed Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania, in agreement with the President of the Commission, Barroso, after [[Varujan Vosganian]] withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] and party financing by a tycoon and Romanian foreign minister [[Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu]] refused a nomination. Barroso assigned him the portfolio of multilingualism.<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1499&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en President Barroso presents the Commissioner designate for Romania], ''European Commission Press Release'', October 30, 2006.

The assignment of this portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was criticized as not being substantial enough for a Commissioner, as being a more administrative than political post, and the reasons proposed are that a technocrat rather than a politician was appointed by Romania<ref>[http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=world_news&month=november2006&file=world_news2006110224558.xml Romanian oppn wants better EU portfolio], ''The Peninsula'' (Reuters), November 2, 2006.

In his speech at the  hearing at the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament Leonard Orban focused on promoting [[language learning|foreign language learning]].<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/commission/2006_enlarg/speeches/speech_orban_en.pdf Speech before the Committee on Culture and Education of the  of the EP], ''European Parliament website'', November 27, 2006.

Retrieved on [[January 28]], [[2007]].</ref>

He said , "I will spearhead the Commission's work on a portfolio which has become more important with every [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]".  He assured [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] that his portfolio was a substantial one, covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities.

"Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active [[multilingualism]] policy into a variety of [[language policy|policies]] which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the [[internal market]]: [[culture]], [[education]] and [[competitiveness]]", Orban told the committee.
 
"Europe's linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," he said. Multilingualism was good for business, Orban told MEPs:  "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [... but]  multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism."

He added that "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]".  Leonard Orban said he would also aim to improve [[language teaching]] and work for the creation of a Business Forum on Multilingualism and to make the media and new [[Information technology|communication technologies]] more language-friendly. He also announced a [[translation]] contest between schools from all over Europe, as part of events marking the 50th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]].

He continued,  "I would carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity, the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism. Before the end of 2007, I would organise a [[Council of the European Union|Ministerial conference]] to discuss the way forward. I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area."

He added that "The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for [[lifelong learning]] to be launched next year. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union as well as to the languages of the EU's main trading partners."

He stated that protection of language rights was a matter for the Member States: "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States", he added.

His views on multilingualism fall in line with the current European Union language policy as described lately in the [[22 November]], [[2005]] Communication from the Commission "A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism".<ref>''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&lg=en&type_doc=COMfinal&an_doc=2005&nu_doc=596 Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions - A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism]'' COM(2005) 596 final, November 22, 2005.
