'''Saint Lidwina''' ([[April 18]] [[1380]] â€“ [[April 14]] [[1433]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[saint]]. At age 14, Lidwina was [[ice skating]] when she fell and broke a rib.  She never recovered and became progressively invalid for the rest of her life.  Saint Lidwina is thought to be one of the first known [[Multiple sclerosis]] patients and her fall and consequent disability due to the disease. She died at the age of 53.  She is the [[patron saint]] of ice skaters and her feast day occurs on April 14th.
