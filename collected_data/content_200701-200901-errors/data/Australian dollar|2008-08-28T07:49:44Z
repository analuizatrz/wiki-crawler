The '''dollar''' is the [[currency]] of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], including [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and [[Norfolk Island]], as well as the independent [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island state]]s of [[Kiribati]], [[Nauru]] and [[Tuvalu]]. The Australian dollar's [[ISO 4217]] code is ''AUD'' but it is often abbreviated with the [[dollar sign]] ''$''. ''A$'' or ''AU$'' is often used informally to distinguish it from other [[dollar]]-denominated currencies. It is subdivided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s. 

The Australian dollar is currently the sixth-most-traded currency in world<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.forextradinghq.com/the-australian-dollar-official-currency-of-the-commonwealth-of-australia.html | title=The Australian Dollar  | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> [[exchange rate|foreign exchange markets]] (behind the [[euro]], [[United States dollar|US dollar]], the [[yen]], the [[pound sterling]], and the [[swiss franc]]), accounting for over 6% of worldwide foreign-exchange transactions. The Australian dollar is popular with currency traders due to high interest rates in Australia, the relative freedom of the foreign exchange market from intervention by the Australian government, the general stability of the economy and political system, and the prevailing view that it offers diversification benefits in a portfolio containing the major world currencies (especially because of its greater exposure to Asian economies and the commodities cycle). In the inter-bank foreign exchange market AUD/USD is known simply as the "Aussie"{{Fact|date=May 2008}}.

==History==
The dollar was introduced on 14 February 1966, replacing the duodecimal [[Australian pound]] (distinct from the [[pound sterling]] since 1929){{Fact|date=May 2008}} with a [[decimalisation|decimal currency]].  
[[Image:20royalsfront.jpg|thumb|A 20-royal note]]
[[Image:10royals.jpg|thumb|A 10-royal note]]

===The royal===
In 1965, the [[Prime Minister]], [[Robert Menzies]], wished to name the currency "the royal" and other names such as "the austral", "the oz", "the boomer", "the roo", "the kanga", "the emu", "the digger", "the kwid" and, jokingly, "the ming" (the nickname of Menzies) were also proposed. Due to Menzies' influence, the name "royal" was settled on, and trial designs were prepared and printed by the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]]. The choice of name for the currency proved unpopular, and it was later shelved in favour of "dollar".{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

===The dollar===
On [[14 February]] [[1966]] the dollar was introduced at a rate of two dollars per pound, or ten [[shilling]]s per dollar. At its introduction, it was pegged to sterling at a rate of 1 dollar = 8 shillings (2.5 dollars = 1 pound). In 1967, Australia effectively left the sterling area for the first time. When sterling devalued in 1967 against the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar did not follow. It maintained its peg to the U.S. dollar at the same rate of 1 Australian dollar = 1.12 U.S. dollars.

==Coins==
[[Image:Oz20cent.jpg|thumb|200px|Australian twenty-cent coin]]
{{main|Coins of the Australian dollar}}
In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents. One-dollar coins were introduced in 1984, followed by two-dollar coins in 1988. The one- and two-cent coins were discontinued in 1991 and withdrawn from circulation.<ref>In commemoration of the 40th anniversary of [[decimal currency]], the 2006 mint [[Proof coinage|proof]] and [[Coin grading|uncirculated]] sets included one- and two-cent coins.</ref> Cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents. As with most public changes to currency systems, there has been a great amount of [[seignorage]] of the discontinued coins. All coins portray the head of state, Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] on the obverse, and are produced by the [[Royal Australian Mint]].

Australia has regularly issued commemorative 50-cent coins. The first was in 1970, commemorating [[Captain Cook]]'s exploration along the east coast of the Australian continent, followed in 1977 by a coin for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]], the wedding of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]] in 1981, the [[Brisbane]] [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1982, and the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988. Issues expanded into greater numbers in the 1990s and the 21st century, responding to collector demand. Australia has also made special issues of 20-cent and one-dollar coins.

There are many<!--How many?--> five-dollar coins, of [[aluminium]]/[[bronze]] and [[bimetal|bi-metal]], and many silver and gold [[bullion]] coins in higher denominations. These are not normally used in payment, although they are [[legal tender]].

Current Australian 5-, 10- and 20-cent coins are identical in size to the former Australian, New Zealand and British sixpenny, shilling and two shilling (florin) coins. In 1990. the UK replaced these coins with smaller versions, as did New Zealand in 2006 - at the same time discontinuing the five-cent coin. With a mass of 15.55 grams and a diameter of 31.51 mm, the Australian 50-cent coin is one of the largest coins in circulation today. {{Clarifyme|date=March 2008}}

==Banknotes==
{{mainarticle|Banknotes of the Australian dollar}}

===First series===
The first paper issues of Australian dollars were issued in 1966.  The one, two, ten and 20-dollars bills had exact equivalents in the former pound banknotes. The five-dollar note was issued in 1967, after the public had become familiar with decimal currency. There had not previously been an equivalent Â£2 10s note. 

The one-dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1984, while the two-dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1988. The 50-dollar note was introduced in 1973 and the 100-dollar note in 1984.

===Polymer series===
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Australian $10 note 1988.jpg|thumb|The first polymer banknote, the 1988 Australian $10 note]] -->
In 1988, the Reserve Bank of Australia issued plastic, specifically [[polypropylene]] [[polymer banknotes]] (produced by [[Note Printing Australia]]), to commemorate the bicentenary of European settlement in Australia. These notes contained a transparent window with an optically variable image of Captain James Cook as a security feature. Australian banknotes were the first in the world to use such features. All Australian notes are now made of polymer.

==Value of the Australian dollar==
In 1966, when the Australian dollar was introduced, the International [[gold standard]] still operated. The dollar was at that time worth 980 mg of gold. As of February 2008 the dollar was worth 30 mg of gold.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dgcsc.org/goldprices.htm | title=Digital Gold Currency Standards Consortium | accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>

The highest value of the Australian dollar in the first two decades after it was floated was 96.68 US cents on 18 March 1984 <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/dollar-hits-23year-high/2007/10/12/1191696127737.html | title=Dollar hits 23-year high  | work=[[The Age]] | date=[[2007-10-12]] | accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>.  The Australian dollar returned to 96.68 US cents on 30 June 2008<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&sid=aQV4HwdZoDek | title=Australian Dollar Falls Before RBA Meeting: New Zealand's Drops | work=[[Bloomberg]] | date=[[2008-07-01]] | accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>, and subsequently rose to a new post-float high of 98.49 US cents on 15 July 2008<ref>{{cite news | url = http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24028828-26103,00.html | title=Dollar above 98 US cents | work=[[The Australian]] | date=[[2008-07-16]] | accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref>.  The lowest value of the Australian dollar after it was floated was 47.75 US cents in April 2001<ref>{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/BUSINESS/asia/11/12/aust.economy.biz/ | title=Global risk weighs on Howard's agenda | work=[[CNN]] | date=[[2001-11-12]] | accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref>.

It is also currently the 14th [[Highest valued currency unit]].

==Exchange rate policies==
Australia maintained a [[Fixed exchange rate|peg]] to the British pound at par then at 0.8 GBP (16 shillings sterling). This reflected its historical ties as well as a view about the stability in value of the British pound. From 1946 to 1971, Australia maintained a peg to the US dollar under the [[Bretton Woods system]], but it was effectively pegged to sterling until 1967.

With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, Australia converted the mostly fixed peg to a moving peg against the US dollar. In September 1974, Australia moved to a peg against a basket of currencies called the [[trade weighted index]] (TWI) in an effort to reduce fluctuations associated with its peg to the US dollar.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} The peg to the TWI was changed to a moving peg in November 1976, causing the actual value of the peg to be periodically adjusted.

On 9 December 1983, the  [[Australian Labor Party|Australian Labor]] [[government of Australia|government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Paul Keating]] "[[Floating exchange rate|floated]]" the Australian dollar. From that point, movements in the Australian dollar reflected the credits and debits in the balance of payments. The terms of trade does not determine the value of the dollar but it is a major component of the balance of payments.

[[Image:FOREX USD vs AUD and NZD.png|thumb|450px|center| Recent history of USD versus the AUD and NZD; grey bars indicate US recessions only.]]

For decades, Australia's reliance upon commodity (mineral and farm) exports has seen the Australian dollar rally during global booms, and fall when mineral prices slumped or when domestic spending overshadowed its export earnings outlook. The currency's high volatility, currency exposure and interest swap<!--Huh?--> has made the AUD one of the most traded currencies in the world, far in excess of the economy's importance (2% of global economic activity).
