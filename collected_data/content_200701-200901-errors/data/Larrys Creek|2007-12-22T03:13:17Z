A part of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] [[drainage basin]], its watershed drains 89.1&nbsp;square miles (230.8&nbsp;km²) in six [[Township (Pennsylvania)|townships]] and a [[borough (United States)|borough]]. The creek flows south from the [[dissected plateau|dissected]] [[Allegheny Plateau]] to the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians]] through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the [[Devonian]], [[Mississippian]], and [[Pennsylvanian]] periods.

The valley's first recorded inhabitants were the [[Susquehannock]]s, followed by the [[Lenape]] and other tribes.<ref name="history">

==Name==
Larrys Creek is named for Larry Burt, the first European settler in the area, who lived near the mouth of the creek outside what is now the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Larrys Creek in [[Piatt Township, Pennsylvania|Piatt Township]]. He traded with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], and, according to a tradition reported by Meginness (1892), he had a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] wife.<ref name="history"/> Larry Burt was already there when surveyors came through in 1769 (after the land was purchased by the colonial government of Pennsylvania on [[November 5]] [[1768]] as part of the "New Purchase" in the first [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]), but disappeared sometime soon after, perhaps moving west with the Native Americans who left the area.<ref name="history"/>

Today the creek has given its name to the hamlet at its mouth, as well as the village of "Larryville" further upstream. Before it became a borough, [[Salladasburg, Pennsylvania|Salladasburg]] was also known as "Larrys Creek" (from the name of its post office). The "First Fork" and "Second Fork" of Larrys Creek are named in the order in which they are encountered traveling upstream, with "Fork" here denoting a major tributary. "Lawshe Run", the major tributary of the Second Fork, is named for Robert Lawshe, who established a tannery in Salladasburg in 1848.<ref name="history"/> "Seeley Run", a minor tributary entering the creek at Larryville, is named for Mr. Seely, who built the first sawmill on Larrys Creek in 1796.<ref name ="sawmills"/> While the USGS uses "Seeley Run", it is still "Seely Run Road" that follows the stream.<ref name="lycoming"/>

The First Fork is next largest, with a watershed of 17.6&nbsp;square miles (45.6&nbsp;km²) or 19.8% of the total. Roaring Run accounts for 5.7% of the total watershed with 5.1&nbsp;square miles (13.2&nbsp;km²) and other tributaries are less than 5% of the total.<ref name="river miles"/> 

Starting at the mouth, the tributaries of Larrys Creek are: Seeley Run, Canoe Run, First Fork Larrys Creek, Second Fork Larrys Creek, Mash Run, "Pond Hollow", "Spook Hollow", Roaring Run, "Cramer Hollow", "Pot Lick Hollow", "Match Pine Hollow", "Watt Hollow", Long Run, Wendell Run, Crayton Hollow Run, Wolf Run, Dibber Hollow Run, and Birch Run (unnamed streams in a named feature are given as the name of the feature in quotation marks).

Their name meant "people of the muddy river" in [[Algonquin]].  [[decimate|Decimated]] by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River Valley]] were then chiefly occupied by the [[Munsee]] [[phratry]] of the [[Lenape]] (or Delaware), and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the [[Iroquois]].

On [[November 5]] [[1768]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] acquired the "New Purchase" from the Iroquois in the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement. However, the [[Line of Property]] (or [[Purchase Line]]) border defined by "Tiadaghton Creek" dividing colonial and Native American lands was disputed. The colonists claimed this was Pine Creek, the Iroquois and other tribes that it was Lycoming Creek. Larrys Creek was in the disputed territory between these, so the illegal settlers there were part of the "[[Fair Play Men]]" system of self-government, with their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on [[July 4]] [[1776]].<ref name="history"/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Fair Play Settlers of the West Branch Valley, 1769-1784: A Study of Frontier Ethnography |last= Wolf|first= George D. | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] | year = 1969 |location= [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]}} (no ISBN)</ref> 

In the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and Native Americans allied with the British. After the [[Wyoming Valley battle and massacre]] in the summer of 1778 (near what is now [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]]) and smaller local attacks, the "[[The Big Runaway|Big Runaway]]" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to [[Muncy, Pennsylvania|Muncy]], then further south to [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]]. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the "Little Runaway". [[Sullivan's Expedition]] helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war.<ref name="picture">{{cite book

On [[April 13]], [[1795]], Lycoming County was formed from [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]], prompting further growth. In 1800, the "State Road" was the second major road built in the county and followed part of Larrys Creek in Cogan House Township as it ran from Newberry (the western part of Williamsport today) north to the Pennsylvania-[[New York]] state line near [[Painted Post, New York]]. Larrys Creek had a bridge near the mouth by 1806, the first of the major creeks in the county for which a bridge is mentioned.<ref name="history"/>

===Lumber===
[[Image:Larrys_Creek.JPG|thumb|250 px|Larrys Creek in Cogan House Township, heading south into State Game Lands. Most such land was acquired by the state after being clear-cut.]]
Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish [[homesteading|homesteads]] and farms.  As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for [[sawmills]] and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).<ref name="history"/> 

This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek lead to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22&nbsp;miles (35&nbsp;km) of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were [[steam power]]ed (the rest were [[water power]]ed). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.<ref name ="sawmills"/>

Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On [[May 2]], [[1872]] a large [[forest fire]] destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, 6&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the watershed today.<ref>{{cite web | author= Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, State Bureau of Forestry |authorlink= Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources | url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/forestry/sfmanagement.aspx | title= "State Forest Management" |accessdate= 2007-08-12}} ''Note:'' Follow these links for photographs of the sawmills operating in [[:Image:Sawmill in Mifflin Township PA.JPG|Mifflin Township]] and [[:Image:Sawmill in Salladasburg, Pennsylvania.JPG|Salladasburg]]. </ref>

===Paper railroads===
Two "paper railroads" were proposed for Larrys Creek: the "Larry's Creek Railroad and Coal Company", incorporated [[June 24]], [[1839]] to hold 2,000&nbsp;acres (8&nbsp;km²) and operate up to 7&nbsp;miles (11&nbsp;km) of railroad from the mouth of the creek north to the coal mines; and the "Jersey Shore, Pine Creek & State Line Railroad", incorporated on [[April 11]], [[1853]] to run north from Jersey Shore up Pine Creek to [[Tioga, Pennsylvania|Tioga]] or Long Run, and thence to the [[New York-Pennsylvania border|New York state line]]. Its charter was amended [[April 4]], [[1854]] to run up [[Marsh Creek (Pine Creek)|Marsh Creek]] (then known as the Third Fork Pine Creek) and [[Crooked Creek (Pennsylvania)|Crooked Creek]] to the Tioga Railroad, and again on [[March 26]], [[1856]] to run up Little Pine Creek (then known as First Fork Pine Creek) to the Larrys Creek Plank Road and then up Blockhouse Creek to [[Blossburg, Pennsylvania|Blossburg]]. It was still an active corporation in 1865, but the charter of the "[[Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway]]" in 1870 (New York City-Reading interests) superseded it. Neither railroad was actually ever built.<ref name="taber atlas">{{cite book

In 1851 a [[plank road]] or puncheon was built along Larrys Creek from the village of Larrys Creek at the creek's mouth north to Salladasburg, then later along the Second Fork and on to the village of Brookside in Cogan House Township. It was later extended north to the village of White Pine and finally to the village of English Center in [[Pine Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Pine Township]] (along the current course of [[Pennsylvania Route 287]]).

The plank road was a [[toll road]] run by "The Larrys Creek Plank Road Company", a corporation founded [[May 8]], [[1850]]. It served the sawmills, grist mills, mines, and leather tanneries along the creek. There was a connection to the railroad and the [[Pennsylvania Canal (West Branch Division)|West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania Canal]] at the hamlet of Larrys Creek, as well as the West Branch Susquehanna River.

[[Tsuga|Hemlock]] logs were used to build the plank road. At that time, the tree's bark was a major source of [[tannin]] used to [[tanning|tan]] leather. The wood was not used much for lumber, so hundreds of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally left to rot. There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from the local timber industry.

The earth under the plank road was first graded, then ties (similar to those used for railroad tracks) were set into the ground. Next long narrow stringers (similar to rails on a railroad track) were nailed to the ties, with a distance between stringers of about 6&nbsp;feet (1.8&nbsp;m). The road surface consisted of planks about 8&nbsp;feet (2.4&nbsp;m) wide nailed to the stringers and was fairly smooth. The road had turnoffs (as it was not wide enough for horse drawn vehicles to pass each other). [[Toll house]]s were at regular intervals, with variable tolls for pedestrians, riders on horseback and various carts and wagons. No toll schedule has survived.

The plank road was operational for about 38 years when a major flood on [[June 1]], [[1889]] washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the [[Johnstown Flood]], which killed over 2200 people.<ref name="history"/> The Cogan  House Covered Bridge was the only one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream.<ref name="now and then"/> The 90&nbsp;foot (27&nbsp;m) long [[Burr truss|Burr arch truss]] bridge was built in 1877, listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.<ref name="arch">{{cite web

[[Image:Plank_Road_Sign.JPG|thumb|250 px|Today the name is all that remains of the Larrys Creek Plank Road.]] 
By then most of the original forests in the county had been clear-cut, so no cheap source of wood was available as before. While the road from Salladasburg south to the West Branch Susquehanna River was repaired and rebuilt, the rest was not. In 1900 the county courts recognized a [[petition]] to end tolls on this last portion of the road. The corporation was dissolved and the road and its maintenance passed to the county. As sections of plank road wore out they were replaced by [[dirt road|graded dirt]] and [[gravel road|gravel]], so that it soon became a regular road. The plank road operated as a toll road for about 49 years.<ref name="plank"/> Today only the "Plank Road" name survives, in a 0.6&nbsp;mile (1&nbsp;km) section of road that runs north from [[U.S. Route 220 (Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 220]], parallel to Route 287.<ref name="lycoming"/>
