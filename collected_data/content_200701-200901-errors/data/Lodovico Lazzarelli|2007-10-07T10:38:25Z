'''Ludovico Lazzarelli''' ([[San Severino Marche]], [[February 4]][[1447]] - San Severino Marche, [[June 23]][[1500]]) was an Italian poet, philosopher, courtier and alleged magician and diviner of the early Renaissance. 

He had contact with many important thinkers of his time and above all with the preacher and hermeticist [[Giovanni da Correggio]]. Himself a follower of [[hermetism]], Lazzarelli also translated the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', a translation which follows and enlarges the hermetic texts previously translated and collected by [[Marsilio Ficino]].

==Biography==
The most important document for reconstructing Lazzarelli's biography is the ''Vita Lodovici Lazzarelli Septempedani poetae laureati per Philippum fratrem ad Angelum Colotium'' written by Lazzarelli's brother Filippo. This text addressed to the humanist [http://www.comune.jesi.an.it/presentazione/ang_colocci.htm: Angelo Colocci] was written immediately after Lazzarelli's death. The ''Vita'' is characterized by an hagiographic tone and pays particular attention to the author's literary endeavors while passing under silence important aspects of his career, e.g. his interest for magic arts. This document, however, gives important evidence of Lazzarelli's otherwise uncertain chronology. <ref> The text of the Vita can be read in M.Meloni,"Lodovico Lazzarelli umanista settempedano e il ''De Gentilium deorum imaginibus'', in ''Studia picena'', 66 (2001):114 ff.</ref>

Thanks to this document, for example, we know that Lazzarelli was born in 1447 and earned his early literary education in [[Teramo]]. In this town, the lord of Pesaro Alessandro Sforza awarded a thirteen years old Lodovico with a price for a poem on the battle of San Flaviano in 1460. Lazzarelli's family had moved to Teramo after their father's death, but Ludovico was born in San Severino Marche(in Latin Septemdpedanus, hence Lazzarelli's humanistic nickname). <ref> G.Arbizzoni, "Lazzarelli, Ludovico," ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'' p. 180</ref>
