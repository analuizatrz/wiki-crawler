{{Template:Petipa ballets}}

'''''Le Corsaire''''' ('''''The Pirate''''') is a [[ballet|Grand ballet]] in three acts, with a libretto originally created [[Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges]], based in part by the poem ''[[The Corsair]]'' by [[Lord Byron]]. Originally choreographed by [[Joseph Mazilier]] to the music of [[Adolphe Adam]]. First presented by the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Ballet du Théâtre de l´Impérial de l´Opéra]] in [[Paris]] on [[23 January]] [[1856]].

The ballet has many celebrated passages which are often extracted from the full-length work and performed independently &mdash; the scene ''Le jardin animé'', the ''Pas d'Esclave'', the ''Pas de trois des odalisques'', and the so-called ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', which is among classical ballet's most celebrated and performed excerpts.

Today ''Le Corsaire'' is performed chiefly in two different versions. Those productions derived from the [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet]]'s 1987 production (initially staged by [[Pyotr Gusev]] for the [[Maly Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Maly Theatre]] of Leningrad in 1955); and those derived from the Ballet Master [[Konstantin Sergeyev]]'s production (initially staged for the [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet]] in 1973, and later for the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] in 1992). The most famous production derived from Sergeyev's version is [[American Ballet Theatre]]'s 1999 staging.

Today Adolphe Adam's score for ''Le Corsaire'' contains a substantial amount of additional musical material, primarily acquired by way of revivals staged by Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg. By the time Petipa staged his final revival of ''Le Corsaire'' in 1899, the score included musical contributions from eleven composers: [[Cesare Pugni]], [[Prince Pyotr Georgievich of Oldenburg]], [[Léo Delibes]], [[Riccardo Drigo]], [[Baron Boris Fitinhof-Schell]], [[Yuli Gerber]], [[Albert Zabel]], [[Ludwig Minkus]], [[Mikhail Ivanov (composer)|Maikhail Ivanov]] and [[Alexander Zibin]]. Although many modern productions credit Léo Delibes jointly with Adolphe Adam for the score, it is Cesare Pugni who has the greater musical contribution.

== Origins ==

[[Lord Byron]]'s 1814 poem ''The Corsaire'' was adapted for the ballet on five occasions throughout the early to mid 19th century. The first production was staged by [[Giovanni Galzerani]] in 1826 for the [[La Scala|Ballet of La Scala]] in Milan.

On [[August 12]], [[1835]] a second adaptation of ''The Corsair'' was presented in Paris by the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Ballet du Théâtre de l´Académie Royale de Musique]] under the title ''L'Ile des pirates''. This ''ballet-pantomime'' was set to a libretto by the noted dramatist [[Adolphe Nourrit]], with choreography by the Opéra's Ballet Master [[Louis Henry]]. The score was a musical pastiche fashioned from airs by [[Beethoven]], [[Rossini]], and [[Luigi Carlini]] by the composer [[Casimir Gide]]. The legendary ballerina [[Fanny Elssler]] danced the principal role of Hauptrolle to great acclaim, but the production was only given nine performances.

The third adaptation was staged by the Ballet Master [[Ferdinand Albert Decombè]] to the music of the French harpist [[Nicolas Bochsa]] for the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Ballet of the King's Theatre]], London, in 1837. In 1844 this version was revived by Decombè quite successfully for [[Adèle Dumilâtre]], the ballerina most noted for creating the role of Myrtha in ''[[Giselle]]''.

The legendary Ballet Master [[Filippo Taglioni]] presented the fourth adaptation of Byron's ''The Corsair'', set to the music of [[Herbert Gärich]]. Taglioni's version premiered on [[March 13]], [[1838]] at the [[Berlin State Opera|Court Opera]] in Berlin, [[Prussia]].

The fifth adaptation of Byron's ''The Corsair'' proved to be among the most celebrated and enduring ballets ever created. The work was first presented on [[January 23]], [[1856]] by the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Ballet du Théâtre de l´Impérial de l´Opéra]] (the theatre was known more commonly as the ''Paris Opéra''. Today the ballet company is known as the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]). The work was the brainchild of the ''Minister of State'' [[Adolphe Billault]], who also served as director of the Théâtre Impérial de l´Opéra, and of the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], wife of [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]].

The choreographer was the Paris Opéra's renowned ''Premier Maître de Ballet'' [[Joseph Mazilier]], one of the most celebrated choreographers of his time, who was highly skilled in producing the full-length narrative ballets then in vogue. He had many successes to his credit, including ''[[Le Diable à Quatre (ballet)|Le Diable à Quatre]]'' in 1845, and ''[[Paquita]]'' in 1846.

As was standard practice in 19th century ballet, a literary man was commissioned to write the libretto, and here Mazilier looked to the most celebrated dramatist available&mdash;[[Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges]]&mdash;who fashioned a scenario loosely based on Byron's poem (Vernoy crafted libretti for many ballets throughout his life, most notably ''[[Giselle]]'' in collaboration with [[Théophile Gautier]] in 1841, and later for Marius Petipa's ''[[The Pharaoh's Daughter]]'' in 1862).  

[[Image:Corsaire -Medora -Carolina Rosati -1856.JPG|right|180px|thumb|<center>The Italian ''Prima ballerina'' Carolina Rosati, creator of the role of Medora, costumed for Mazilier's original production of ''Le Corsaire'' at the Théâtre Impérial de l´Opéra. Paris, 1856]]

''Le Corsaire'' was created primarily for the talents of the famous Italian ballerina [[Carolina Rosati]], who was then the Paris Opéra's reigning ''Prima'', who was much celebrated for her great beauty, strong ''pointes'', clean ''batterie'', precision of execution, and easily intelligible [[mime artist|mime]]. The score was commissioned, for a phenomenal fee of 6,000 [[franc]]s in addition to royalties, from [[Adolphe Adam]], who at that time was one of the most distinguished composers writing for both the ballet and the [[opera]] in France. The libretto for ''Le Corsaire'' went through many changes during the long months of the ballet's preparation, requiring Vernoy to be paid an additional 3,000 francs for the work. 

''Le Corsaire'' premiered to a resounding success, with Rosati's interpretation of the heroine Medora becoming the rage of Paris. Mazilier's choreography and his staging of the ''[[mise en scène]]'' were highly praised by the balletomanes and critics. Among is most the most notable passages was the ''Pas des Éventails'' of the second scene of act I&mdash;an elaborate ''[[Grand pas]]'' in which the heroine Medora and a large ''corps de ballet'' created a "peacock effect" with large fans during the ''Grand adage''. This was followed by a string of difficult [[variation (ballet)|variations]] for the principal dancers, and ending with a spectacular ''[[coda (ballet)|coda]]''. The stage effects&mdash;designed by the master machinist [[Victor Sacré]]&mdash;were hailed as the best yet seen on the stage of the Opéra. Sacré's realistic execution of the sinking Corsaire ship of the last scene became immortalized by [[Gustave Doré]]'s drawing.

In attendance for the first three performances were Emperor Napoleon III and his wife, the Empress Eugénie, who had played a large part in the work's gestation. So moved by ''Le Corsaire'' was the Empress that she exclaimed ''"In all my life I have never seen, and probably never shall see again, anything so beautiful or so moving."''

Adam's score was highly praised for its melodiousness, orchestration, and dramatic intensity. It was to be the composer's last work&mdash;he died of a heart attack on [[May 3]], [[1856]], nearly four months after the ballet's premiere. On the evening of the day of his death, ''Le Corsaire'' was given at the Paris Opéra in memoriam to him. In attendance was the royal family with their guest of honor, [[William I of Württemberg|King William I of Württemberg]]. As equally moved by the ballet as was the Empress Eugénie, Emperor Napoleon III gave orders that all of the evening's box office receipts be given to the composer's widow. 

''Le Corsaire'' was given 43 performances at the Opéra with only Rosati as Medora. Her interpretation of Medora was considered by all to be incomparable, and after her departure from Paris in 1859 the ballet was taken out of the repertory. Not long afterwards the Ballet Master Mazilier retired.

== ''Le Corsaire'' in Russia ==
=====The first production=====

''Le Corsaire'' was first staged in Russia for the [[Imperial Ballet]] of St. Petersburg by the [[Ballet Master]] [[Jules Perrot]], being given for the first time on {{OldStyleDate|January 24|1858|January 12}} at the [[Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]]. The production was mounted especially for the Ballerina [[Ekaterina Friedbürg]], with the young [[Marius Petipa]] as Conrad. For this production Petipa assisted in rehearsals, and was permitted by Perrot to revise some of the dances, including the ''Pas des Éventails'' and the ''Scéne de seduction'' of act II.

=====Petipa's Revivals=====

Over the course of his long career, Petipa revived ''Le Corsaire'' on four occasions, each time significantly revising the ''[[mise en scène]]'' and adding a substantial number of new ''[[pas]]'', variations, and incidental dances. His first revival was staged especially for his wife, the ''[[Prima Ballerina]]'' [[Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa]], with the Danseur [[Christian Johannson]] as Conrad. The production premiered on {{OldStyleDate|February 5|1863|January 24}}, and included a substantially revised score by the composer [[Cesare Pugni]] that included much additional material.

Four years later [[Joseph Mazilier]] came out of retirement to mount a revival of ''Le Corsaire'' at the Paris Opéra for the German Ballerina [[Adèle Grantzow]], a production which included new music by [[Léo Delibes]]. The production was also staged in celebration of the 1867 [[Universal Exposition]] given that year in Paris. Mazilier's revival premiered on [[October 21]], [[1867]], and was given 81 performances with Grantzow performing the role of the heroine Medora. After her departure from Paris the work was again taken out of the repertory, and to date has never again been performed by the Parisian ballet.

In the winter of 1867, Granztow was invited to perform with the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg. For the occasion, Petipa staged a revival of ''Le Corsaire'', which was given for the first time on {{OldStyleDate|February 6|1868|January 25}}. For the production Petipa again called upon Cesare Pugni to compose music for new dances. 

Petipa's third revival of ''Le Corsaire'' was staged especially for the Russian Ballerina [[Eugeniia Sokolova]], given for the first time on {{OldStyleDate|November 22|1885|November 10}}. 

Petipa presented his last and most important revival of ''Le Corsaire'' on {{OldStyleDate|January 25|1899|January 13}}, at the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]]. This production was mounted especially for the benefit performance of [[Pierina Legnani]]&mdash;''Prima ballerina assoluta'' of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres&mdash;with [[Olga Preobrajenskaya]] as Gulnare, and [[Pavel Gerdt]] as Conrad.

[[Image:Corsaire -Choreographic Notation.JPG|thumb|right|250px|<center>A Page from the Stepanov choreographic notation of the [[Sergeyev Collection]], which documents Marius Petipa's original choreography for the scene ''Le jardin animé'' from ''Le Corsaire''.]]

=====The notation of Petipa's 1899 revival=====

In 1894 the Imperial Ballet began documenting the their repertory in [[Stepanov method of dance notation]]. The choreography for ''Le Corsaire'' began to be documented in 1894 with the scene ''Le jardin animé'', and was completed in 1906. After the [[Russian revolution of 1917]] the Imperial Ballet's régisseur [[Nicholas Sergeyev]] brought the choreographic documentation out of Russia, utilizing it to stage such classics as ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Ballet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', as well as Petipa's definitive versions of ''[[Giselle]]'' and ''[[Coppélia]]'' for the first time in the west primarily for the [[Vic-Wells Ballet]] (today the [[Royal Ballet]]). From there these ballets went on to be staged all over the world. In 1969 [[Harvard University]] purchased this collection, where it now resides as the [[Sergeyev Collection]].

In 2007, the Bavarian State Ballet utilized the notation to reconstruct 25 dances from Petipa's 1899 revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for their new production. The [[Bolshoi Ballet]] made use of the notations as well when they staged their lavish production of ''Le Corsaire'' in 2007.

== Notable additional pieces ==

A substantial number of supplemental ''[[pas]]'', variations and various other dances were inserted into ''Le Corsaire'' throughout its performance history, primarily by Marius Petipa in Imperial Russia. Below is a list of the history of the most notable of these pieces.

=====''Overture''=====

For his 1863 revival Petipa commissioned the composer [[Cesare Pugni]] to revise and add to Adam's score. Among these new numbers was an elaborate ''[[overture]]'' which opened the first act. 

Pugni's musical contribution to Adam's music was so prolific that he received equal credit for the score in Imperial-era programs.

=====''Pas d'esclave''=====

In 1858 Petipa interpolated a [[pas de deux]] taken from his 1857 ballet ''[[The Rose, the Violet, and the Butterfly]]'', a work set to the music of [[Prince Pyotr Georgievich of Oldenburg]]. Petipa titled the piece as the ''Pas d'Esclave''. 

Petipa arranged the ''Pas d'Esclave'' as a dramatic ''Pas d'action'' for three dancers in the  the first act, in which a slave girl was presented to the buyers of the slave market. Originally the slave girl was partnered by a male slave and an additional suitor. When [[Agrippina Vaganova]] staged her version of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Kirov Ballet in 1931, the ''Pas d'Esclave'' included the character Gulnare rather than an anonymous slave girl. Vaganova further revised the ''pas'' by excluding the additional suitor, transforming the ''pas'' into a duet. It was not until Pyotr Gusev's revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Leningrad Maly Theatre in 1955 that the character Lankendem began to take part in the ''Pas d'Esclave''.

Originally the ''Pas d'Esclave'' consisted of no variations for the soloists. Over time various solos were interpolated from other works. The traditional variations in place today have been included in the ''Pas d'Esclave'' since the early 20th century. The first variation, traditionally danced by the character Lankendem, is set to music by the composer [[Alexander Zibin]]. Taken from an unknown work, the variation was first interpolated into the piece by the Danseur [[Pierre Vladimirov]] when he danced in the piece in 1914. The Mariinsky Theatre's score for ''Le Corsaire'' titles the solo as ''21/12/1914; Variation pour Vladimirov''. Today the variation is performed in an edition by [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]], created in 1931.

St. Petersburg, 1899]]

The female variation, traditionally danced today by the character Gulnare, is by [[Riccardo Drigo]]. It was originally created as an addition to Marius Petipa's 1888 ballet ''[[The Vestal]]''. Today the variation is performed in an edition by the Ballet Master [[Pyotr Gusev]].

=====''Finesse d'amour''=====

In 1863 Petipa arranged a comedic scene for his wife, Maria Surovshchikova-Petipa, to music by Cesare Pugni, which he called ''Finesse d'amour''. The music was originally a variation which Petipa added to his revival of another of Mazilier's ballets&mdash;''[[Le Diable amoureux (ballet)|Le Diable amoureux]]'' (staged in Russia as ''Satanella'')&mdash;for the Ballerina [[Praskovia Lebedeva]].

The scene ''Finesse d'amour'' took place in the first act, with the heroine Medora teasing the Seid Pasha while the slave-trader Lankendem attempts to sell her. Today the scene is only retained in selected stagings of ''Le Corsaire''&mdash;such as the [[Boston Ballet]] and [[American Ballet Theatre]]'s productions&mdash;and only in a shortened version. In 2007 the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] presented Petipa's reconstructed choreography for ''Finesse d'amour'' in their production of ''Le Corsaire''.

=====''Pas de six''=====

For his revival of 1868, Petipa replaced Mazilier's original ''Pas des Éventails'' in the second scene of act I, with an elaborate ''Pas de six'' for the Ballerina [[Adèle Grantzow]], set to new music by Cesare Pugni. The ''[[pas]]'' was staged for the characters Medora, Conrad, and four ''coryphées''. The ''pas'' included only one variation for Medora and a dance for the four ''coryphées''. Originally

The ''Pas de six'' was retained in the St. Petersburg edition of ''Le Corsaire'' until 1915. That year the ''pas'' was deleted and replaced by a ''[[Pas d'action]]'' created by the choreographer [[Samuil Andrianov]], which is today known as the ''[[Le Corsaire Pas de Deux]]''.

=====''Le petite Corsaire''=====

In 1863 Petipa inserted another dance for his wife, Maria Surovshchikova-Petipa, into the second scene of act I to a new polka composed by Cesare Pugni. In this solo the heroine Medora performs a dance with a prop megaphone while imitating and costumed as a Corsaire. The variation ends with the Ballerina shouting ''Au bord!''. ''Le Petite Corsaire'' went on to become one of the most celebrated passages of ''Le Corsaire'' (it is described by the Ballerina [[Tamara Karsavina]] in her famous biography ''[[Theatre Street]]'').

=====''Pas de trois des odalisques''=====

In 1863 Petipa expanded the ''Pas des odalisques'' of Act II. Originally this piece consisted only of Adolphe Adam's [[waltz]] from the original score. Petipa expanded this piece into a classical ''[[Pas de trois]]'', consisting of an ''[[Entrée (ballet)|entrée]]'' (being Adam's original waltz), 3 variations, and a [[coda (ballet)|coda]]. The first two variations and the coda were set to new music by Pugni, while the third variation was transferred from another part of Adam's original score.

=====''Danse des forbans''=====

In 1868 Petipa added a new [[mazurka]] into the first scene of act I titled as the ''Danse des forbans'', set to new music by Pugni. The Ballet Master choreographed the mazurka to be lead by the character Birbanto, who made his entrance with two prop [[musket]]s which he "fired" on stage to the musical accents. The mazurka proceeded with a large male ''corps de ballet'' dancing with their prop [[Scimitar]] swords. For his revival of 1899 Petipa moved the ''Danse des forbans'' to the second scene of act I, where it is still retained in many modern productions of ''Le Corsaire''.

=====''Le jardin animé''=====

When Joseph Mazilier revived ''Le Corsaire'' in 1867 for Adèle Grantzow, he inserted a ''[[Grand pas]]'' known as the ''Pas des fleurs'' to new music by [[Léo Delibes]].

In 1868 Marius Petipa revived ''Le Corsaire'' for Grantzow. In this production he included an elaboratly expanded version of the ''Pas des fleurs'' called ''Le jardin animé''. Delibes' music was brought from Paris by Grantzow in a piano reduction, requiring Cesare Pugni to re-orchestrate. Pugni also expanded the music in accordance with Petipa's new staging. During the early Soviet era&mdash;notably by way of Agrippina Vaganova and Pyotr Gusev's revivals for the Kirov Ballet&mdash;Pugni's expanded passages for Delibes's music were edited out. Nevertheless Pugni's orchestrations were retained, and as such many ballet companies today perform this version of Delibes's music, notably [[American Ballet Theatre]] and the [[Mariinsky Ballet]].

Throughout the Soviet-era Petipa's choreography and the music for the scene ''Le jardin animé'' went through many revisions. The most notable version familiar with modern audiences was staged by Pyotr Gusev in 1955, and is today included in many western productions of ''Le Corsaire''. In 2004 the [[Pacific Northwest Ballet|Pacific Northwest Ballet School]] presented a reconstrcution of Marius Petipa's choreography as notated in the [[Sergeyev Collection]] for the final performance at the end of the school year. In 2006 the [[Bayerisches Staatsballett|Bavarian State Ballet]] and included the reconstructed choreography for the scene in their production of the full-length ''Le Corsaire'', and in 2007, the Bolshoi Ballet also included the restored edition for thier new production.

=====Alternate variations in ''Le jardin animé''=====

For Petipa's 1899 revival new variations for Medora and Gulnare were used in substitution of Delibes' original solos in the scene ''Le jardin animé''. The first, danced by Olga Preobrajenskaya as Gulnare, was originally the ''Variation d´Amour'' taken from the 1876 Petipa/Minkus ballet ''[[The Adventures of Peleus or Thetis and Peleus|The Adventures of Peleus]]'', while the second variation, danced by Pierina Legnani as Medora, was taken from Petipa's 1883 ballet ''[[Pygmalion or The Cyprus Statue|Pygmalion]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Cyprus Statue''). The variation is by the composer Riccardo Drigo, and was added to ''Pygmalion'' in 1885.

The variation danced in 1899 by Olga Preobrajenskaya as Gulnare is no longer performed in ''Le jardin animé'', and has been replaced over time by a variation Petipa choreographed in 1885 for the Ballerina [[Eugenia Sokolova]] to the music of [[Albert Zabel]] (principal harpist in the orchestra of the St. Petersburg [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]] at the turn of the 20th century). Today Sokolova's variation is retained in almost all productions of ''Le Corsaire'' during the scene ''Le jardin animé'' as a variation for the character Gulnare.

The variation danced in 1899 by Pierina Legnani as Medora is still retained in the scene ''Le jardin animé'' in the [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's]] production of ''Le Corsaire''.

The ''Prima ballerina'' [[Natalia Dudinskaya]] preferred to dance a rarely heard variation taken from Ludwig Minkus's original score for Petipa's ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' in substitution of Legnani's variation. This variation is retained as a variations for the character Medora in the scene ''Le jardin animé'' in Amercian Ballet Theatre's produciton of ''Le Corsaire''.

== The ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' ==

The so-called ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' is one of the most popular and performed excerpts in all of classical ballet. Today this celebrated piece has become a major repertory staple of ballet companies all of over the world, while many dancers perform it in ballet competitions.

On {{OldStyleDate|January 24|1915|January 11}}, ''Le Corsaire'' was presented in a new production at the Mariinsky Theatre. For this revival the Ballet Master [[Samuil Andrianov]]&mdash;who performed the role of Conrad&mdash;arranged a new ''[[Pas d'action]]'' for the second scene of act I.

Originally this scene contained the ''Pas des Éventails''&mdash;an elaborate ''[[Grand pas]]'' that made use of large fans&mdash;which the Ballet Master Mazilier offered in his original production as a ''[[Pièce de résistance]]''. In 1863 Petipa replaced the ''Pas des Éventails'' with a ''Pas de six'' to the music of Cesare Pugni. For the 1915 production, Andrianov replaced Petipa's ''Pas de six'' with a new ''[[Pas d'action]]''.

[[Image:Corsaire -1899 -6.JPG|frame|right|<center>Tamara Karsavina costumed as Medora in the 1915 production of ''Le Corsaire'' at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]]

The opening ''[[adagio (ballet)|adagio]]'' was staged by Andrianov for three dancers&mdash;the characters Conrad, Medora (performed by [[Tamara Karsavina]]) and an additional suitor (performed by [[Mikhail Obhukov]]). Then followed variations for the each of the two principals, with the piece ending in a rousing ''[[coda (ballet)|coda]]''.

As was standard practice at that time in ballet history, Andrianov selected music from various sources in order to create this piece. The opening ''adagio'' was set to a [[nocturne]] composed by Drigo titled ''Dreams of Spring''. The variation in triple time performed by the character Conrad was taken from the composer [[Yuli Gerber]]'s score for Petipa's 1870 ballet ''[[Trilby (ballet)|Trilby]]'' (this remains the famous variation performed by all male dancers today in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''). Tamara Karsavina performed a variation in polka rhythm taken from the composer [[Baron Boris Fitinhof-Schell]]'s score for the 1893 ballet ''[[Cinderella (Fitinhof-Schell)|Cinderella]]'', originally staged by Marius Petipa, [[Lev Ivanov]] and [[Enrico Cecchetti]]. Since 1915, Karsavina's variation has been substituted out quite often. Nevertheless her variation is still considered the "traditional" solo for the character Medora in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''. The coda was set to music composed especially for the piece by Drigo.

In 1931, [[Agrippina Vaganova]] revised the choreography of the 1915 ''Pas d'action''. She  transformed the piece into an athletic duet for the graduation performance of her pupil, [[Natalia Dudinskaya]], who was partnered by [[Konstantin Sergeyev]]. Through Vaganova's revision, the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' took on the basic shape it has today. In 1939 Vaganova's version was inserted into the Kirov Ballet's 1936 production of the full-length ''Le Corsaire'', with the dancers [[Galina Ulanova]] and [[Nikolai Zubkovsky]] in the principal roles.

[[Image:Le Corsaire -Vakhtang Chabukiani -1941.jpg|thumb|right|190px|<center>Vakhtang Chabukiani as the Rhab in ''Le Corsaire''. Leningrad, circa 1930]]

It was the noted ''Premier danseur'' of the Kirov Ballet, [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]], who had the most influential hand in refashioning the male dancing of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''. During his performances in the piece during the 1930s he gave the male role more athletic and virtuoso choreographic elements. His interpretaion of the male role became, in essence, the standard, and it has remained so to the present day.

When Pyotr Gusev staged his 1955 revival of the full-length ''Le Corsaire'' for the Maly Theatre in Leningrad, he restored the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' to its original form, with the opening ''adagio'' being performed by three persons.

In 1960, [[Rudolf Nureyev]] staged the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' for himself and [[Margot Fonteyn]] in London. Nureyev called upon [[John Lanchbery]] to create a new orchestration of the music. Today, Lanchbery's arrangements are still in use by many ballet companies in the west.

=====Alternate variations=====

Many variations have been used in substitution of Tamara Karsavina's solo of 1915. One popular variation is the ''Variation de Reine des Dryades'' taken from Alexander Gorsky's 1900 revival of Marius Petipa's ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]''. This variation is by the composer [[Anton Simon]], and features a solo for violin in triple time.

Another variation which is often danced in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' by the ballerina is taken from modern stagings of Marius Petipa's 1877 ballet ''[[La Bayadère]]'', and is traditonally danced by the character Gamzatti in that ballet. The variation is by the composer Cesare Pugni, and is taken from the ''Pas de Venus'' from his score for Petipa's 1968 ballet ''[[Le Roi Candaule]]''.

=====The Slave Ali=====

Originally, the additional danseur who participated in the piece known today as the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' merely served as suitor for the ballerina, and had no other purpose in the ballet's action. By 1937 when the Danseur Nikolai Zubkovsky performed the role, this suitor evolved into a character known as the ''Rhab'' ([[Russian language|russian]] for ''Slave''). By the time the Kirov Ballet's ''Premier danseur'' Vakhtang Chabukiani danced the role in the 1930s, the character wore a costume which consisted of baggy pants and chains strapped around a shirt-less torso. Over time the costume came to include the now standard head-band with a feather protruding from the forehead. When Pyotr Gusev staged his revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Maly Theatre in 1955, the Rhab character was named Ali, and was given a more prevalent part in the ballet's action. This change in the character from a mere suitor to a slave also gave rise to revisions in the choreography of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', with many of the dancers who performed in the role adding in more athletic and exotic elements of choreography.

== Moscow Productions of ''Le Corsaire'' ==

In March 1858 Petipa was dispatched to mount the Perrot staging of ''Le Corsaire'' for the [[Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre]], who performed the production with some regularity until it was taken from the repertory in 1880. ''Le Corsaire'' was not performed again on the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre until the Ballet Master [[Ivan Clustin]] presented his staging on {{OldStyleDate|March 22|1894|March 9}}.

[[Image:Corsaire -Medora -Ekaterina Geltser -circa 1910 -1.JPG|thumb|right|230px|<center>Ekaterina Geltzer as Medora in Alexander Gorsky's production of ''Le Corsaire''. Moscow, 1912]]

On {{OldStyleDate|January 12|1912|December 31}} Alexander Gorsky&mdash;''Premier Maïtre de Ballet'' of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre&mdash;presented his own version, with [[Ekaterina Geltzer]] as Medora and [[Vasily Tikhomirov]] as Conrad. Typical of his revivals of works from the St. Petersburg repertory, Gorsky included more ethnographic and historically accurate elements with regard to the setting (the only surviving example of Gorsky's style in reviving a work from the classical repertory is the famous ballet ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'', which is performed today all over the world in productions derived from his 1901 and 1902 editions staged in Moscow and St. Petersburg).

For his revival of 1912 Gorsky interpolated a substantial number of new dances set to music from a variety of sources, with Adolphe Adam's original music serving as the foundation. The traditional dances as added by Joseph Mazilier and Marius Petipa were retained, while a number of airs taken from the works of such composers as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Reinhold Glière]], [[Karl Goldmark]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], and [[Antonín Dvořák]] were interwoven into the score by the composer [[Anton Simon]], who also included a few pieces of his own. Among the most notable additions was a dream sequence set to a ''[[Nocturne]]'' by Chopin, in which the character Medora dreams of her beloved Conrad, and a ''divertissement'' for Turkish, Persian, and Arabian slave-women during the scene in the slave-market in the first act, which was set to Simon's new music.

Another of Gorsky's additions was the ''[[Pas de deux]]'' which would one day be known as the ''[[Tchaikovsky Pas de deux]]''&mdash;originally fashioned by Tchaikovsky from a supplemental ''Pas de deux'' composed by [[Ludwig Minkus]] which was included in the original 1877 production of ''[[Swan Lake]]''. The piece was placed by the Ballet Master during the second act divertissement set in the Corsaire's underground palace. This ''pas de deux'' was thought to be lost for many years by ballet historians and musicologists. The fact that Gorsky included this piece in his version of ''Le Corsaire'' led to its accidental re-discovery in 1953, when it was found in the archives of the Bolshoi Theatre among the orchestral parts used for Gorsky's 1912 production. Upon learning of the existence of this music, [[George Balanchine]] subsequently choreographed the piece as the ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux'' for the dancers [[Violette Verdy]] and [[Conrad Ludlow]]. Today the piece is quite popular with with companies all over the world.

Gorsky's revival of ''Le Corsaire'' remained in the repertory of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre until 1927. Although the company regularly performed extracts from ''Le Corsaire'' for many years, the full-length work was not given again until [[Konstantin Sergeyev]] staged his version for the company in 1992. 

=====The Bolshoi Ballet's revival of 2007=====

On [[June 21]], [[2007]] the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] presented a lavish revival of ''Le Corsaire'', which included twenty-five of Petipa's dances as staged for his 1899 revival reconstructed from the choreographic notation of the [[Sergeyev Collection]]. The staging proved to be the most expensive production of a ballet ever mounted, estimated at $1.5 million [[USD]].

Adam's original score as performed for Mazilier's 1867 revival was obtained from the archives of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. The production also made use of music taken from Riccardo Drigo's score for [[Lev Ivanov]]'s 1887 ballet ''[[The Enchanted Forest]]'' for a ''[[Grand pas]]'' in the last act.

== ''Le Corsaire'' in Leningrad and the West ==

Petipa's last revival of ''Le Corsaire''&mdash;which was given a new productions in 1915&mdash;remained in the repertory of the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] until 1928 (after the 1917 Russian Revolution the ballet company was known as the ''State Petrograd Ballet'', and later the ''State Academic Ballet'', before it was renaimed the ''Kirov Ballet''). By 1928 ''Le Corsaire'' had been performed 224 times since 1899 at the Mariinsky Theatre.

[[Agrippina Vaganova]], the revered pedagogue of Russian Ballet, supervised the first "after Petipa" revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Kirov Ballet, first performed on [[May 15]], [[1931]]. In [[1936]] another revival of ''Le Corsaire'' was given by the Kirov Ballet, with [[Natalia Dudinskaya]] as Medora, [[Mikhail Mikhailov]] as Conrad, and [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]] as the Slave (or Rhab, as the character was known in Russia). This was the first production of the full-length work to include Vaganova's 1931 revision of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' as staged for Dudinskaya's graduation performance. The revival also included a new version of the ''Pas d'Esclave'', with the characters Lankendem and Gulnare peforming in the piece. The 1936 revival remained in the Kirov Ballet's regular repertory until 1941.  From 1941 until 1959 the production was only given on a few occasions until it was totally removed from the repertory.

=====Pyotr Gusev's Revival of 1955=====

[[Image:Corsario.jpg|thumb|right|250px|<center>Viktoria Tereshkina as Gulnare in the ''Pas d'Esclave'' from the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's production of ''Le Corsaire''. St. Petersburg, 2006]]

The Balletmaster [[Pyotr Gusev]] staged a new version of ''Le Corsaire'' for the [[Maly Theatre]] of Leningrad in 1955. This was the first production of the work to present a modified version of the libretto, written by Gusev and the ballet historian [[Yuri Slonimsky]]. A new character was also included&mdash;known as the slave Ali&mdash;a role which evolved out of the Slave who took part in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' in the early Soviet productions of ''Le Corsaire'' at the Mariinsky Theatre.

Gusev opted to include a completely new version of the ballet's score. Although the Ballet Master retained the traditional interpolations of Petipa and Mazilier, he opted to discard nearly all of Adam's original score in favor of music fashioned from airs taken from Adam's 1842 ballet ''[[La Jolie fille du gand]]'' and his 1852 opera ''[[Si j'étais roi]]'', with the conductor [[Eugene Kornblit]] adapting and orchestrating the music accordingly.

Additional dances were also added: a ''pizzicati'' taken from [[Riccardo Drigo]]'s score for Petipa's 1889 ballet ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|The Talisman]]'', which was used to accompany a dance for four ''coryphées'' in the scene ''Le jardin animé''. Gusev also added dances for Turkish, Persian, and Arabian slave-women to music by Anton Simon, taken from Alexander Gorsky's 1912 revival at the Bolshoi Theatre. With the new music fashioned from Adam's other works, new [[leitmotif]]s were created for the ballet's main characters.

Gusev also created a new prologue in his revival, which included the famous shipwreck transferred from the last scene. There followed a scene set on a beach where Gusev staged a ''[[pas]]'' for the characters Medora, Gulnare and ten ''coryphées''. 

Gusev's revival premiered on [[May 31]], [[1955]], and went on to become the most popular version of ''Le Corsaire'' in Russia. In 1977 the director of the Kirov Ballet, [[Oleg Vinogradov]], staged Gusev's version for the company, who still retain the production in their repertory.

=====Konstantin Sergeyev's Revival of 1973=====

In 1973, the Ballet Master of the Kirov Ballet, [[Konstantin Sergeyev]], staged his own version of ''Le Corsaire''. For this production Sergeyev included a new variation for the characters Conrad and Birbanto in Act I fashioned from themes taken from Adam's original score. Sergeyev also included two dances taken from Riccardo Drigo's score for Petipa's 1894 ballet ''[[The Awakening of Flora]]''&mdash;a dance for eight slave girls in the first act, and an ''adagio'' for the characters Medora and Conard in the second act (this number is often referred to as the ''"Bedroom Pas de Deux"''). 

Sergeyev's revival only lasted nine performances in the Kirov's repertory, as the production was pulled when the Ballet Master fell into disfavor with the Soviet government due to the recent defections from the [[U.S.S.R.]] of [[Natalia Makarova]] and [[Mikhail Baryishnikov]]. His production was replaced in 1977 by Pyotr Gusev's revival, which was staged by the company's newly appointed director Oleg Vinogradov.

In 1987 the Kirov Ballet decided to present a revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for its upcoming world tour.  There was much debate as to whether Gusev's staging would be retained or whether Sergeyev's version would be reinstated. The company chose to retain Gusev's version, while still lavishing the production with new sets and costumes. This staging premiered to great success in New York at the [[Metropolitan Opera House]] on [[July 3]], [[1989]] with the Ballerina [[Altynai Asylmuratova]] as Medora (this production was filmed at the Mariinsky Theatre in April 1989, and has been released onto DVD/video).

In 1992 [[Yuri Grigorovich]], director of the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] of Moscow, invited Sergeyev to mount his 1973 revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the company. This production&mdash;which included a heavily re-edited and re-orchestrated score by the Bolshoi Theatre's conductor [[Alexander Sotnikov]]&mdash;premiered on [[March 11]], [[1992]] to great success, but after only seven performances Grigorovich decided to pull the production from the repertory. After witnessing the success of Sergeyev's production, Grigorovich decided to stage his own version, which premiered on [[February 16]], [[1994]]. Grigorovich's production was then taken out of the repertory after the director left the company in 1995. In 2005 the [[Russian Philharmonic Orchestra]] and conductor Yuri Tkatchenko recorded the version of the score used for Grigorovich's 1994 production, which was released by the publishing company [[Shinshokan]].

The sets and costumes designed by [[Irina Tibilova]] for Konstantin Sergeyev's 1992 Moscow production sat unused in the archives of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] for almost five years. At the suggestion of Sergeyev's wife, the Ballerina and teacher [[Natalia Dudinskaya]], [[Anna-Marie Holmes]] staged Sergeyev's production for the [[Boston Ballet]] (with the assistance of Dudinskaya, [[Tatiana Terekhova]], [[Sergei Berezhnoi]], [[Tatiana Legat]], and [[Vadim Disnitsky]]). The music for this production was copied from the conductor's score used for Sergeyev's production in Sotnikov's orchestration, as well as additional parts taken from the Mariinsky Theatre Library. In some cases the Boston Ballet used copies of the Bolshoi's score from Grigorovich's 1994 version, which also contained orchestrations by Alexander Sotnikov. The Boston Ballet music librarian Arthur Leeth, the company pianist Marina Gendal, and conductor Jonathan McPhee performed a cut-and-paste operation on the score as the choreography was adapted for the new staging. This required the re-ordering of many numbers, as well as a few new transitional passages which were composed by Kevin Galie. Galie also did some minor reorchestrating throughout many parts of the score. This production premiered on [[March 27]], [[1997]] with the Ballerina [[Natasha Akhmarova]] as Medora, to great success.

Nearly one year later, [[American Ballet Theatre]] rented the Boston Ballet's production of ''Le Corsaire''. The staging went through even more revisions both choreographically and musically, with modifications performed by American Ballet Theatre conductor Charles Parker and the company pianist Henrietta Stern. With regard to the plot, a crucial revision was made by the transformation of Mediterranean Corsaires into Caribbean Pirates. This production premiered on [[June 19]], [[1998]], with [[Nina Ananiashvili]] as Medora, [[Ashley Tuttle]] as Gulnare, [[Giuseppe Picone]] as Conrad, [[Jose Manuel Carreño]] as Ali, and [[Vladimir Malakhov]] Lankendem. The [[American Ballet Theatre|ABT]] production was later filmed at the [[Orange County Performing Arts Center]] in [[Costa Mesa]], [[California]] by [[PBS]] for [[Great Performances]] in 1999, with [[Julie Kent]] as Medora, [[Paloma Herrera]] as Gulnare, [[Ethan Steifel]] as Conrad, [[Angel Corella]] as Ali, and [[Vladimir Malakhov]] as Lankendem. The film has since been released onto DVD/video

=====Pacific Northwest Ballet School's reconstruction of ''Le jardin animé''=====
In June 2004 the School of the [[Pacific Northwest Ballet]] in [[Seattle]] presented a reconstruction of Petipa's choreography for the scene ''Le jardin animé'', taken directly from the notation of the [[Sergeyev Collection]]. It was staged by the dance historian and Stepanov notation expert [[Douglas Fullington]], and [[Manard Stewart]], former principal dancer of the Pacific Northwest Ballet.

=====Bavarian State Ballet's Revival of ''Le Corsaire''=====
In 2006, the [[Bayerisches Staatsballett]] (Bavarian State Ballet) presented a partial reconstruction of Petipa's 1899 revival of ''Le Corsaire''. For this production, twenty-five of Petipa's original dances were reconstructed from the [[Stepanov Choreographic Notation]] of the [[Sergeyev Collection]].

== Structure ==



Below is a list of the dances and ''mise en scène'' from the Bolshoi Ballet's recent revival of ''Le Corsaire'', which follows the original 1856 libretto as close as possible while still including most of the important interpolations. Unless otherwise noted, all of the music is the work of Adolphe Adam. All libretti and programs of works performed on the Tsarist stage were titled in French, which was the official language of the Imperial Russian Court, as well as the language in which balletic terminology is derived.
