==Biography==
===Childhood and discovery===
Spears was born in [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]], [[Mississippi]],<ref>{{cite web | author=NNDB | title=Britney Spears | publisher=nndb.com | year= 2006 |  url=http://www.nndb.com/people/049/000022980/#FN1 | accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref> and raised [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] in [[Kentwood, Louisiana|Kentwood]], [[Louisiana]]. Her parents are James Parnell Spears, a building [[general contractor|contractor]], and Lynne Irene Bridges, a former [[grade school]] teacher. Spears's brother, Bryan, is one of her [[management|managers]], and her sister, [[Jamie Lynn Spears|Jamie-Lynn]], is an [[actor|actress]] and singer. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portelli, was an [[England|English]] [[war-bride]], who met Spears's maternal grandfather, Barnett O'Field Bridges, in [[England]] during World War II, and subsequently moved with him to the [[United States|US]]. Her paternal grandparents were June Austin Spears and Emma Jean Forbes.<ref name=spearsancestry>{{cite web | author=William Addams Reitwiesner | title=Ancestry of Britney Spears | publisher=wargs.com | url=http://www.wargs.com/other/spears.html | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

Spears was an accomplished gymnast, attending [[gymnastics]] classes until age nine and competing in state-level competitions. She performed in local dance revues and her local Baptist church choirs, and was auditioning for the [[Disney Channel]]'s ''[[The New Mickey Mouse Club]]'' by the time she was eight. Although she was considered too young to join the series at the time, a producer on the show introduced her to a [[New York City|New York]] agent. Spears subsequently spent three summers at NYC's [[Professional Performing Arts School]] and also appeared in a number of [[off-Broadway]] productions, including 1991's ''Ruthless!'' In 1992 she landed a spot on ''[[Star Search]]'', and though she won the first round, she lost in the second. Spears then returned to the Disney Channel for a spot on the ''New Mickey Mouse Club'' and was accepted. She was featured in the 1993–94 seasons from the ages of 11–13. Other performers on the show included [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[JC Chasez|Joshua Chasez]]  whom later became members of the pop group [['N Sync]], [[Keri Russell]], fellow pop singer [[Christina Aguilera]], and actor [[Ryan Gosling]]. After the show ended, Spears went back home to [[Kentwood, Louisiana]] and entered high school at 14 where she had her last bit of normalcy.<ref>{{cite web | author=Askmen.com Staff | title=Britney Spears Bio | publisher=Askmen.com | url=http://www.askmen.com/women/singer/2c_britney_spears.html | accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>

Spears briefly joined the [[girl group|all-female]] [[pop music|teeny-bopper pop]] [[band (music)|group]] [[Innosense (band)|Innosense]]. She later decided to go [[solo (music)|solo]] and a few years later recorded a [[demo tape]], which landed in the hands of [[Jive Records]]. She was signed to that label and began touring American venues for a series of concerts sponsored by [[United States|American]] [[teen magazine]]s, before joining [[*NSYNC]] and becoming their opening act. It was during this time that Britney was diagnosed with [[Crohn's Disease]].<ref>[From MTV Candid Bios 2005] </ref>

Towards the end of 1998, Spears's debut [[single (music)|single]] "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]" began to appear on MTV. Accompanied by a [[music video]] that featured the pop princess in a [[Roman Catholic]] [[schoolgirl]] outfit, the song became an international success, earning [[Music recording sales certification|double platinum]] sales and going to number one in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], as well as going number one in a large number of countries throughout the world.

The photo shoot triggered speculation that the still-seventeen-year-old had had [[breast implant]]s which she denied.<ref name="breastimplants">{{cite web | title=The Mysteries of Britney’s Growth Spurt | author=''Soundproof'' Magazine Staff | publisher=Lowculture.com | year=1999 | url=http://www.lowculture.com/soundproof/news/news_britneyspurt.htm | accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>. That summer, she kicked off her first headlining tour, the [[...Baby One More Time Tour]]. By late 1999, Spears had become one of the year's biggest stars. In December, she took home four [[Billboard Music Awards]] including one for Female Artist of the Year, and the next month won for Favorite Pop/Rock New Artist at the [[American Music Awards]]. At the 2000 [[Grammy Award]]s Spears received two nominations, including one for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] which she lost out to [[Christina Aguilera]]. The other was for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for "[[...Baby One More Time]]" but she lost that to [[Sarah McLachlan]].

Following the short-lived [[Crazy 2K Tour]], the lead single from Spears's second album, "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]", was released. The song broke a record for most radio station adds in a single day,<ref>{{cite web | author=Rock on the Net Editors | title=Rock on the Net:Britney Spears | publisher=rockonthenet.com | year= 2006 | url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-s/britneyspears_main.htm | accessdate=2006-05-01}}</ref> and quickly became a U.S. top ten hit and number one single in other countries. Released in May 2000, the album ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' debuted at number one in the U.S., where it sold 1,319,193 units during its first week, breaking the record for biggest first-week sales of an album by a solo artist, male or female.<ref>{{cite web | author=Richard Skanse | title=Oops!...

Twain contributed her adult-40 brand of country-crossover infusion to the record. Spears kicked off her first world tour, the [[Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour]], in the summer of 2000, and co-wrote the book ''[[Britney Spears's Heart-to-Heart|Britney Spears's Heart-to-Heart]]'' with her mother, Lynne which was a bestseller. During a performance at the 2000 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], she ripped off a black suit to reveal a provocative nude-colored and crystal-adorned outfit that generated controversy due to her young age. In late 2000, she won two Billboard Music Awards, and in early 2001, she was nominated for two [[American Music Awards]]. At the Grammys, her two nominations were for ''Oops!... I Did It Again'' in the categories of [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] but again she did not win.

===2001&ndash;2003: Career development===
In early 2001, Spears struck a multi-million  promotional deal with [[Pepsi]] which included numeral television commercials, point-of-purchase promotions and Internet ties between Spears's and Pepsi.<ref name=Pepsideal>{{cite web | author=Jaan Uhelszki | title=Britney Chooses Pepsi | publisher=Rollingstone.com | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5919256/britney_chooses_pepsi | year=[[February 8]],[[2001]] | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref> In September of the same year, she performed at the MTV Video Music Awards.

In November, she released her third album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]''. It debuted at number one on both the U.S. and Canadian charts, selling 745,744 units during its first week in the U.S.<ref name="britneysales">{{cite web | author=Andrew Dansby | title=Britney's "Britney" Is Tops | work=[[Rolling Stone magazine]] | year=November 14, 2001 | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/britneyspears/articles/story/5918984/britneys_britney_is_tops | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> The success of this album made Spears the only female artist in SoundScan history to have her first three albums debut at number one.<ref>{{cite web | author=Rock on the Net Editors | title=Rock on the Net:Britney Spears | publisher=rockonthenet.com | year= 2006 | url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-s/britneyspears_main.htm | accessdate=2006-05-01}}</ref>  ''Britney'' was the first album on which Spears assumed some creative control co-wroting five of the album's tracks. To help promote the album, Spears embarked on the [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]] during the same year. Spears was nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]], [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for the song "[[Overprotected]]" and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] for ''Britney''. She lost both to [[Norah Jones]]. 

In February 2002, Spears had her first starring role in the film, ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''.

That same year ''[[Forbes magazine|Forbes]]'' named her the most powerful celebrity in the world.<ref name=forbes2002>{{cite web | author=Forbes Editors | title=Forbes Celebrity 100 | publisher=forbes.com | year=2002 | url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/home.jhtml?passListId=53&passYear=2002&passListType=Person | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

Spears returned to the spotlight in August 2003 when she performed at the MTV Video Music Awards with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], pop singer [[Christina Aguilera]] and rapper [[Missy Elliott]]. Spears and Aguilera performed Madonna's song "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]", and each locked lips with Madonna.

[[Image:Inthezone.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Cover for ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003)]]
''[[In the Zone]]'' is generally considered Spears's most overtly sexual album to date.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gavin Mueller | title=In The Zone Review | publisher=''Stylus Magazine'' | year=November 18, 2003 | url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/britney-spears/in-the-zone1.htm | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>
November 2003 saw the release of Spears's fourth studio album, ''In the Zone''. Jettisoning the [[Max Martin]]-produced [[synthpop]] of her earlier releases, the album took in lesser-known producers such as [[Christopher Stewart (music producer)|RedZone]] and big names including [[Moby]] and [[R. Kelly]]. Spears co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs and co-produced some of her material for the first time. ''In the Zone'' went to the top of the U.S. charts in its debut week, selling over 609,000 copies. This made Spears the only female in music history to have her first four studio albums debut at number one.<ref name=inthezonestats>{{cite web | author=''Yahoo!

The album spawned the international number one and U.S. number nine hit single, "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]", which won Spears her first Grammy in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]].<ref name=grammyaward>

In 2004, Spears embarked on her fourth world tour, [[The Onyx Hotel Tour]]. The tour grossed over US$38 million and was seen by over 650,000 fans in North America and Europe, but the remaining dates were cancelled in June, after Spears injured her knee during the filming of the video for the single "[[Outrageous]]". She was taken to an undisclosed hospital, where she received an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] that showed floating [[cartilage]] in her knee.<ref>{{cite web | author=Stephen Silverman | title=Britney Blows Out Knee, Undergoes Surgery | publisher=people.com | year=[[June 10]] [[2004]] | url=http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,649582,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> The following thirty-seven stops on the tour were canceled.<ref>{{cite web | author=Stehpen Silverman| title=Britney's Bad Knee a Costly Proposition | publisher=people.com | year=[[June 21]] [[2004]] | url=http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,655505,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

===2004&ndash;2006: Career hiatus and family===
On [[January 3]], [[2004]], Spears married her childhood friend Jason Allen  Alexander at [[The Little White Wedding Chapel]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Mike Fleeman | title=Britney Spears Married in Vegas | publisher=people.com | year=[[January 3]] [[2004]] | url=http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,627413,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> Later, an [[annulment]] was promptly arranged (at the behest of manager Larry Rudolph and her family) and was granted on [[January 5]], ending their fifty-five hour marriage. The annulment request stated that Spears "lacked understanding of her actions to the extent that she was incapable of agreeing to marriage because before entering into the marriage the Plaintiff and Defendant did not know each other's likes and dislikes, each others' desires to have or not have children, and each other's desires as to State of residency".<ref>{{cite web | author=The Smoking Gun editors| title=Britney Spears's annulment request | publisher=thesmokinggun.com | year=2004 | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/britneyannul1.html | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

In July 2004, Spears announced her [[engagement]] to [[Kevin Federline]], three months after they met at a club in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]. Federline had very recently been in a relationship with actress [[Shar Jackson]], who was still pregnant with their second child.<ref>{{cite web | author="New York AP" | title=Shar Jackson says she was dating Kevin Federline... | publisher=usatoday.com | year=[[November 4]] [[2005]] | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-11-04-shar-jackson-federline_x.htm | accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>
On the night of [[September 18]], [[2004]], Spears married Federline before twenty-seven guests in a surprise, [[non-denominational]] ceremony at a residence in [[Studio City, California]] (legally [[October 6]], [[2004]]).<ref>{{cite web | author="Smoking Gun" editors | title=Britney Spears's "Faux" Wedding | publisher=smokinggun.com | year=[[November 8]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0924042_britney_spears_1.html | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

During the later half of 2004, Spears announced she would be taking another career break in order to start a family. Immediately after her marriage to Federline, she had told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', "I want to be a young mom. Next year, at 23, I'm so there."<ref>{{cite web | author=''People'' Magazine editors | title=Britney Healthy, Happy About Pregnancy | publisher=People.com | year=April 14, 2005 | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,710113_1048979,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>  Although she put her career on hold, the 'Britney Spears industry' continued to run without her involvement.

[[Image:Curiosityperfume.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Promotion for "Curious" at the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] in 2004]]
Spears endorsed a fragrance, "[[Curious (fragrance)|Curious]]", for which she earned a reported US$12 million. After one year of sales, the product netted more than US$100 million. ''Curious'' was named the best selling perfume of 2004.<ref>{{cite web | author=Wasserman, Todd  | title=What's a Step Above “Curious”?

Following the success of "Curious", Spears released her next [[Elizabeth Arden]] fragrance, "[[Fantasy (fragrance)|Fantasy]]", in September 2005 which was another big hit at department stores.

Spears's first hits collection, ''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]'', was released in late 2004. The album debuted at number four on the U.S. charts with over 255,000 copies sold. In addition to her biggest hits, it featured three new songs, including "[[My Prerogative]]" and "[[Do Somethin']]". During the spring of 2005, Spears's [[reality show]] with husband Kevin Federline, ''[[Britney & Kevin: Chaotic]]'', premiered on [[MTV]] in the U.S. The five-episode series credited Spears and Federline as [[executive producer]]s. ''Chaotic'' was panned by most critics and fewer-than-expected people watched the shows five episodes. The series was later released on [[DVD]] in September 2005. The DVD included a bonus music disc which featured her newest song and [[music video]] at that point in her career, "[[Someday (I Will Understand)]]".

Spears announced her [[pregnancy]] via her official website in April 2005. That month she was rushed to a hospital in [[Destin, Florida|Destin]], [[Florida]], where she spent forty-eight hours under a doctor's surveillance.<ref>{{cite web | author=''People'' Magazine | title=Britney Healthy, Happy About Pregnancy | publisher=people.com | year=[[April 14]] [[2005]] | url=http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,1039012_1048979,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> On [[September 14]], [[2005]], 6 lb. 11oz. baby boy Sean Preston Federline was born in the Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]], by a scheduled [[caesarean section]].

On [[February 20]], [[2007]], Britney re-admitted herself to a treatment facility, this time in [[Malibu, California]].

Family Law attorneys interviewed by [[Fox News]] point out that false starts in rehab are not uncommon and as long as Spears finishes the program it should not affect her position in any future custody hearing, one attorney stated “There's ins and outs and a lot of false starts with this sort of stuff. As long as she finishes what she's done, goes in, gets help, gets treatment and stays clean, the court will look positively on that.”<ref>{{cite news|title= Rehab Could Help Britney Spears Keep Custody of Her Two Children|date=Friday, February 23, 2007|url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,254199,00.html|publisher=Fox News}} Retrieved on Feb. 24, 2007</ref>

==Acting career==
In February 2002, Spears starred in a film, ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'', which reached number two on the [[box-office]] charts in its first weekend, but quickly left theaters. The film ended up making slightly over $60 million worldwide, about five times its budget of $12million USD. Songs from the album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' appeared in the film. The movie, along with Spears's performance in it, was poorly received by critics<ref>{{cite web | author=Rotten Tomatoes | title=''Crossroads'' Reviews | publisher=rottentomatoes.com | year=2006 | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crossroads/ | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> and she netted herself a [[Razzie Award]] for Worst Actress. The film won the [[Razzie Award|Razzie]] for the Worst Original Song "[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]".

Spears has made cameo appearances on the films ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002) as herself, and ''[[Longshot (film)|Longshot]]'' (2000) as a [[Flight Attendant]].  She also appeared on a [[documentary]] entitled ''Guest List Only'' which focused on the [[Los Angeles]] Club Scene.<ref>{{cite web | author=Yahoo!Movies | title=''Britney Spears'' filmography | publisher=Yahoo!Movies | year=2006 | url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800328228/filmography | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

On [[March 30]], [[2006]], Spears was a [[guest-star]] on an episode of [[NBC]]'s television show ''[[Will & Grace]]'' titled "Buy, Buy Baby". She played "Amber-Louise", a [[the closet|closeted]] [[lesbian]] posing as a [[conservative Christian]] who is to co-host with [[Jack McFarland]] on his talk show "JackTalk" after a large corporation takes over "OutTv", the show's network. This marked her debut on a scripted [[primetime]] television show playing someone other than herself. [[NBC]] received criticism from conservative Christian groups for the episode.<ref>{{cite web | author=Joal Ryan | title= What Would Britney Do? | publisher=eonline | date=02/01/2006 | url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,18270,00.html?newsrellink |accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=imdb.com | title = Buy, Buy Baby episode summary | publisher = imdb.com | date = 2006 |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0782659/ | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

In addition, she has appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' twice as host and musical guest: once on [[May 13]], [[2000]], then again on [[February 2]], [[2002]].<ref>{{cite web | author = imdb.com | title = Attention to "Saturday Night Live" list | publisher = imdb.com | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005453/ | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> On [[October 18]], [[2003]], she appeared as musical guest with [[Halle Berry]] as host.
