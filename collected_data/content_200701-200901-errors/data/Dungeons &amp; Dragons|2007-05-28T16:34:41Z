'''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''D&D''''' or '''''DnD''''') is a [[fantasy]] [[roleplaying game]] (RPG) originally designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]], and first published in [[1974]] by Gygax's company [[TSR, Inc.|Tactical Studies Rules]] (TSR). The game is currently published by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. It was derived from [[Miniature wargaming|miniature wargame]]s (particularly ''[[chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'')<ref name="Banshee_Gygax"/>. ''D&D'''s publication is widely regarded as the beginning of modern role-playing games — and by extension, the entire role-playing game industry.<ref>{{cite web

Players of ''D&D'' create characters who embark upon imaginary adventures in which they battle monsters, gather treasure, interact with each other, and earn [[experience points]] to become increasingly powerful as the game progresses. ''D&D'' departs from traditional wargaming by assigning each player a specific character, as opposed to an army.  Miniature figures or markers on a grid are sometimes used to represent these characters. ''D&D'' also introduced the concept of a [[Dungeon Master]] (DM), a referee and storyteller responsible for maintaining the fictional [[setting (fiction)|setting]] of the game as well as enforcing the rules of the game.

The early success of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' led to a proliferation of similar game systems, such as ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'',<ref name="hist2"/> ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]'' and ''[[RuneQuest]]''.<ref name="hist3"/>  Despite this competition, ''D&D'' has continued to dominate the role-playing game industry throughout its existence, enjoying a nearly unassailable market position.<ref>[[Monte Cook]], former D&D designer and an independent publisher, describes the extent of D&D's lead in these extreme terms: "Frankly, the difference in sales between Wizards and all other producers of roleplaying games is so staggering that even saying there is an "RPG industry" at all may be generous."

''Dungeons & Dragons'' is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game.  Typically, each player controls only a single character.<ref>Sometimes if not enough players, each may control more than one character. The [[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game|Basic Game]] suggests "If there are characters left over, some players may play more than one. (but they don't have to)" (Tweet 2004) Read This First sheet.</ref> As a group, these [[player characters]] (PCs) are often described as a "party" of adventurers, often each with his or her own areas of specialized talents.<ref>(Slavicsek & Baker 2005:268) Chapter 21:Roleplaying and Working Together</ref> During the course of play, each player directs the actions of his or her character and its interactions with the other characters in the game.<ref>(Tweet 2003:5)</ref>  A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single [[Adventure (role-playing games)|adventure]], and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a "[[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]."<ref>"Encounters are to adventures what adventures are to campaigns"(Cook 2003:129) Introduction of Chapter Five: Campaigns</ref>

The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game is determined by the [[Dungeon Master]] (DM) according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules.<ref>(Cook 2003:4) The Dungeon Master</ref>  The DM selects and describes the various [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions.<ref>(Slavicsek & Baker 2005:293) Chapter 23: Running the Game </ref>  The game's extensive rules&mdash;which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions,<ref>(Cook 2003:98) Urban Adventures</ref> [[Spells of Dungeons & Dragons|magic use]],<ref>(Gygax 1979:114) Magical Research</ref> [[combat]],<ref>(Tweet 2003:114) Combat</ref> and the effect of [[Natural environment|the environment]] on PCs<ref>{{cite book

===Game mechanics===
{{main|Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)}}

[[Image:DnD Dice Set.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A set of standard D&D dice: (from left) d4, d6, d8, d12, d20, and two d10s, respectively, for percentile: ones and tens.]]
<!-- FAIR USE of DnD Dice Set.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:DnD Dice Set.jpg for rationale -->

Before the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] his or her player character (PC) and records the details (described below) on a [[character sheet]].

First, a player rolls dice to determine his or her character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#ability scores|ability scores]],<ref>While the original game used 3d6 (Gygax & Arneson 1974) and this continued as the standard version with some version, though variants have been included (Gygax 1979:11), the standard for 3rd edition is "rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three." (Tweet 2000:4)</ref> which consist of strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.<ref>Given is the current standard order for abilities. Before 2nd edition AD&D they were always ordered strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma.</ref> The player then chooses a [[Race (fantasy)|race]] (species), a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]], an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook) and a number of skills and feats to enhance the character's basic abilities.<ref>(Tweet 2000:4) Character Creation Basics</ref> Additional [[back-story|background history]], not covered by specific rules, is often also used to further develop the character.<ref>(Gygax 1978:34) Establishing the Character</ref>

During a game, players describe their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM [[in character]] who describes the result or response.<ref>(Tweet 2004:24) Exploring</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. More complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to success include the character's abilities, skills and the difficulty of the task.<ref>(Tweet 2003:62) Using Skills</ref>

As the game is played, each PC grows and changes over time as they gain experience. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills,<ref>(Cook 2003:197) How PCs Improve</ref> wealth, and may even change alignment<ref>Early editions did not allow or had severe penalties for changing alignment (Gygax 1979a:24) but more recent versions are more allowing of change. (Cook 2003:134)</ref> or add additional character classes.<ref>(Tweet 2003:59) Multiclass Characters</ref> One key way characters progress is by earning [[experience points]] (XP) when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task.<ref>(Gygax 1979:84) Experience</ref> Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level]], which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills.<ref>(Tweet 2003:58) Experience and Levels</ref> XP can also be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that require payment of an XP cost.<ref>(Cook 2003:46) Experience Penalties</ref>

[[Hit point]]s (HP) are a measure of a character's vitality and health and are determined by the class, race, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>(Tweet 2003:145) Injury and Death</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key abilities<ref>(Cook 2003:289) Ability Score Loss</ref> or character levels.<ref>(Cook 2003:296) Level Loss</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.<ref>(Cook 2003:41) Character Death</ref>

===Adventures and campaigns===
[[Image:S3ModuleCover.jpg|thumb|175px|''[[Expedition to the Barrier Peaks|S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks]]'' was one of the few adventures released by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] to include [[science fiction]] elements, such as [[ray gun]]s and [[robot]]s.]]
<!-- FAIR USE of S3ModuleCover.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:S3ModuleCover.jpg for rationale -->
{{main|Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons) }}

A typical ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game consists of an "adventure", which is roughly equivalent to a single story.<ref>(Cook 2003:43) Chapter Three: Adventures</ref> Adventures are usually designed by the DM either from scratch or by using [[List of Dungeons & Dragons adventures|pre-made adventures]] (previously known as [[List of Dungeons & Dragons modules|modules]]) which have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Published adventures typically include a backstory, maps, and goals for PCs to achieve, some include illustrations or handouts.

A series of adventures is commonly referred to as a "[[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]".<ref>"A D&D campaign is an organized framework ...to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures."(Schend et al. 1991:256)</ref>  The locations where these adventures occur, whether a city, country, planet or an entire universe are often also called a campaign but are more correctly referred to as a "world" or "[[campaign setting]]".<ref>"It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably.... A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting."(Cook 2003:129)</ref>  The settings are based in various [[fantasy subgenres]] and feature varying levels of magic and technology.<ref>(Williams 1995:45) Properties of Worlds</ref> Popular commercially published [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for Dungeons & Dragons]] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]] and [[Eberron]].<ref>Greyhawk, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Mystara, Spelljammer, Ravenloft, Dark Sun and Planescape are the campaign settings given their own chapter in Johnson et al. (2004). Eberron was only released in 2004 and, as of 2007, is one of two campaign settings, the other being Forgotten Realms, still actively supported with new releases by Wizards of the Coast.</ref>  Alternately, DMs may develop their own [[fictional world]]s to use as campaign settings.

===Miniature figures===
[[Image:Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures 2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Several ''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figures]] <!-- Photograph is under a free license. Figures pictured are FAIR USE as they specifically illustrate the topic under question: D&D miniatures intended for use with D&D  -->

The wargames from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figure]]s to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''Chainmail'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>(Johnson et al. 2004:23)</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally and miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continue to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first Dungeon Masters Guide gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures (Gygax 1979:10) Use of Miniature Figures with the Game.</ref>

In the [[1970s]], numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. In [[1977]], the British manufacturer [[Minifigs|Miniature Figurines Limited]] became the first company to partner with [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] and release miniatures under the official Dungeons and Dragons label.<ref>{{cite web

===Sources and Influences on the Development of ''D&D''===
{{main|Sources and Influences on the Development of Dungeons & Dragons}}

The immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as [[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]. [[Dave Arneson]] used Chainmail to run games where players controlled a single character instead of an army, an innovation that inspired D&D.<ref name="Banshee_Gygax">{{cite web

</ref> 

Many ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements also appear in hobbies of the mid- to late twentieth century (though these elements also existed previously). Character-based role playing, for example, can be seen in [[historical reenactment]] and [[improvisational theatre]].<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Game-world simulations were well-developed in [[wargaming]]. Fantasy milieus specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others.<ref name="hist3"/> Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.

The theme of D&D was influenced by [[mythology]], [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy authors of the 1960s and 1970s. The presence of [[halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], [[half-elf|half-elves]], [[Orc (Dungeons & Dragons)|orcs]], [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]] and the like often draw comparisons to the work of [[Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Gygax maintains that he was influenced very little by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (although the owners of that work's copyright forced the name change of hobbit to halfling), stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity of the work.<ref>{{cite journal

The original alignment system (which grouped all players and creatures into "Law", "Neutrality"  and "Chaos") was derived from the novel ''[[Three Hearts and Three Lions]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]].<ref name="lit_souce"/>  A troll described in this work also influenced the D&D definition of that monster.<ref name="Dragon95"/> 

Other influences include the works of [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[A. Merritt]], [[H.P. Lovecraft]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[L.

===Edition history===
{{main|Editions of Dungeons & Dragons}}
''Dungeons & Dragons'' has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.
[[Image:D&d Box1st.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The original ''Dungeons & Dragons'' set]]
<!-- FAIR USE of D&d_Box1st.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:D&d_Box1st.jpg for rationale -->
The original '''''Dungeons and Dragons''''' was a box set published in [[1974]]<ref>(Gygax & Arneson 1974)</ref> with several supplements and magazine articles of official rules published over the next few years. 

Starting in 1977, TSR began to publish two different versions of the game:  ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (AD&D) and ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (sometimes called ''Basic D&D'' to distinguish it from ''AD&D'', though TSR never used that term).

The version called '''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' (1977 - 1999) was sometimes viewed as an introductory version of ''AD&D'' because it was published as discrete sets of increasing complexity. The first version of the Basic Set<ref>(Gygax & Arneson 1977)</ref> was intended to be something that could serve as an introduction to either original ''D&D'', or the as then still incomplete ''AD&D''.<ref>{{cite journal

</ref> However, after the first version of the Basic Set this game was promoted as an evolution of original D&D and distinct from ''AD&D''.<ref name="dragon26"/>  Although simpler overall than the "Advanced" game, it included rules for some situations not covered in ''AD&D''.  There were five sets: ''Basic'' (1977, revised in 1981 and again in 1983),<ref>(Gygax & Arneson 1977, 1981a & 1983a)</ref> ''Expert'' (1981, revised in 1983),<ref>(Gygax & Arneson 1981b & 1983b)</ref> ''Companion'' (1983),<ref>(Mentzer 1985)</ref> ''Master'' (1985),<ref>(Gygax & Mentzer 1985)</ref> and ''Immortals'' (1986, 1991)<ref>(Mentzer 1986) & (Allston 1992)</ref> each covering game play for higher character experiences levels than the former. The first four sets were later compiled as a single hardcover book, the ''Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia'' (1991).<ref>(Schend et al. 1991)</ref>

'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''''' (or ''AD&D'') was a more complex version of the game. It was designed to create a tighter more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name="dragon26">{{cite journal

</ref> While seen by many as a revision of D&D,<ref name="WTNI"/> AD&D was at time declared to be "neither an expansion nor a revision of the old game, it is a new game."<ref name="dragon26"/> The ''AD&D'' game was not intended to be directly compatible with ''D&D'' and requires some conversion to play between the rule sets.<ref>(Schend et al. 1991:291) Appendix 2: AD&D Game Conversions</ref> The term ''Advanced'' describes the more complex rules and does not imply "for higher-level gaming abilities." Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the "core rulebooks", were released: The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB),<ref>(Gygax 1978)</ref> the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG),<ref>(Gygax 1979a)</ref> and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM).<ref>(Gygax 1977)</ref> Several additional books published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985),<ref>(Gygax 1985)</ref> included a large number of new rules.

<!-- FAIR USE of DungeonMasterGuide4Cover.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:DungeonMasterGuide4Cover.jpg for rationale -->

'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition''''' (sometimes referred to as ''AD&D2'' or ''2nd Ed'') was published in 1989, once again as three core rulebooks. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder which was later replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. The release of ''AD&D2'' also corresponded with an effort to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity. This edition removed references to demons and devils, suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types (such as assassins and half-orcs).<ref name="Dragon 154"/>  Aside from these revisions the rules underwent a number of minor changes including for the addition of non-weapon proficiencies (which originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements) and the division of spells into schools and spheres.<ref>{{cite web

'''''Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition''''' (also referred to as ''D&D3'' or ''3E'' and not to be confused with the 1983 edition of the basic ''D&D'' game) was released in 2000 following three years of development which began when a near-bankrupt TSR was bought by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1997.<ref>Adkison, Peter ''Third Edition'' chapter in Johnson et al. (2004:250) "After... the idea of acquiring TSR began to swim in my mind it took me maybe thirty seconds to decide, We've got to do a third edition of Dungeons & Dragons."</ref> The 3rd Edition was the largest revision of the ''D&D'' rules to date, and also served as the basis for a broader role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the [[d20 System]].<ref>Adkison, Peter ''Third Edition'' chapter in Johnson et al. (2004:273) D20 and the Open Gaming License</ref>  The 3rd Edition rules were designed with the intention of making them more internally consistent and significantly less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players much more flexibility in creating the characters they wanted to play.<ref>Adkison, Peter ''Third Edition'' chapter in Johnson et al.

'''''Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5''''' (also known as Revised 3rd Edition or ''D&D3.5'') in 2003 is a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.<ref>(Tweet 2003:4) Why the Revision?</ref>

A wide variety of optional supplements have been published for every edition of ''D&D''. These supplements commonly include new rules, items, spells, and creatures. Other supplements include new adventures or detail entire fantasy worlds. The various editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have won many [[Origins Award]]s, including ''All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977'', ''Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989'', and ''Best Roleplaying Game of 2000'' for the three flagship editions of the game.<ref>{{cite web

Within months of ''Dungeons & Dragons'''s release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre.

At various times in its history, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has received negative publicity, in particular from the [[Christian Right]], for alleged promotion of such practices as [[Satanism#Devil worship|devil worship]], [[witchcraft]], [[suicide]], and [[murder]], and for topless drawings of female humanoids in the original AD&D manuals (mainly monsters such as [[Harpy|Harpies]], [[Succubus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Succubi]], etc.)<ref name="Moral Panic">{{cite journal

Early in the game's history, TSR took no action against small publishers producing ''D&D'' compatible material. This attitude changed in the mid 1980s when TSR revoked these rights (even from publishers they had earlier officially licensed, such as [[Judges Guild]]),<ref>{{cite journal
