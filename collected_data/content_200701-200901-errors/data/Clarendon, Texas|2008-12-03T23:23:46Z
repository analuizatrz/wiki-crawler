'''Clarendon''' is a city in [[Donley County, Texas|Donley County]], [[Texas]], [[United States]]. The [[population]] was 1,974 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The  [[county seat]] of [[Donley County, Texas|Donley County]],{{GR|6}} Clarendon is located on [[United States Highway 287]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]] some sixty miles east of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]. It was established in 1878 by [[Methodist]] [[clergy]]man '''L.H. Carhart''' as a "sobriety settlement" in contrast to typical [[boom town]]s of that era. It acquired the [[sobriquet]] "Saints Roost" from local [[cowboy]]s: hence the unusual name of the Clarendon [[museum]], the [[Saints' Roost Museum]].<ref>[http://www.texas-on-line.com/graphic/clarendn.htm Texas Online: Clarendon, Texas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Notable residents==
For a community of such small population, Clarendon has been the home of numerous notable persons.

*[[Aviation]] historian [[Randy Acord]] (1919-2008), a Clarendon native, founded the Alaska Air Pioneer Museum in [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], where he had been stationed as a [[test pilot]] in 1943. Acord won the Alaska-Siberia Lend Lease Award for his contributions to [[Russia]]n-[[North America]]n relations during [[World War II]].

*JA Ranch [[matriarch]] [[Cornelia Adair|Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair]] maintained a house in Clarendon and was a benefactor of many Donley County charities. The Saints' Roost Museum in Clarendon is the restoration of her former Adair Hospital. She was active too in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Church in Clarendon. She also maintained residences in [[England]], having become a naturalized British subject, and in [[Ireland]], where she lived part of the year at her late husband's [[Glenveagh Castle]]. She is buried in Ireland.

*[[Harold Dow Bugbee]], [[artist]] of ranching on the [[South Plains|Texas South Plains]] and the Panhandle, maintained his family near Clarendon. He was also the art curator of the Panhandle-Plains Museum for many years prior to his death in 1963. Bugbee's second wife, '''Olive Vandruff Bugbee''', an artist in her own right, lived at the Harold Dow Bugbee Ranch from the time of her brief marriage to Bugbee in 1961 until her death in 2003. The couple left the ranch estate to the Panhandle Plains Museum.

*The [[historian]] [[Harley True Burton]], a former president of Clarendon College, served as the town [[mayor]] from 1955–1963. Burton wrote ''The History of the JA Ranch'', co-owned by [[John George Adair]] of [[Ireland]] and [[Charles Goodnight]], who spent his later years in Clarendon.

*Renowned [[Bison|buffalo]] hunter [[Frank Collinson]] (1855-1943) lived primarily in [[Childress, Texas|Childress]], but is buried in Clarendon.

*Clarendon is the hometown of former [[Oklahoma Sooners]] standout running back [[Kenny King]]. He also played for the [[Oakland Raiders]]. King set a [[Super Bowl]] record for the longest touchdown reception with an 80-yarder in the Raiders 27-10 Super Bowl XV victory over the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. That record stood until [[January 26]], [[1997]]. 

*[[Clarence Hailey Long]], the inspiration for the original [[Marlboro Man]] [[tobacco]] [[advertising]] campaign, lived his later years in Clarendon. A former employee of the [[JA Ranch]], he joined the First [[Baptist]] Church in Clarendon in 1953, after the tragic death of his father in a [[bronco]] accident.<ref>C. H.
