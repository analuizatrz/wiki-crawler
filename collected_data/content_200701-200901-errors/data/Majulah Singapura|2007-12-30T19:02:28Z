"'''''Majulah Singapura'''''" ("Onward Singapore") is the [[national anthem]] of [[Singapore]]. Composed by [[Zubir Said]] in 1958 as a theme song for official functions of the City Council of Singapore, the song was selected in 1959 as the island's anthem when it [[Self-governance of Singapore|attained self-government]]. Upon [[History of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|full independence]] in 1965, "''Majulah Singapura''" was formally adopted as Singapore's national anthem. By law the anthem may only be sung with its original [[Malay language|Malay]] lyrics, although there exist authorized translations of the lyrics of the anthem in Singapore's three other official languages: [[English language|English]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

Originally composed in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[G major]], in 2001 the national anthem was officially relaunched in the lower key of [[F major]] as this was said to allow for a "grander and more inspiring arrangement". 

The national anthem is regularly performed or sung in schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day, during which the [[Flag of Singapore|national flag]] is also raised and lowered and the [[Singapore National Pledge|national pledge]] is taken. Singaporeans are especially encouraged to sing the national anthem on occasions of national celebration or national significance such as at the [[National Day Parade]], at National Day observance ceremonies conducted by educational institutions and government departments, and at sporting events at which Singapore teams are participating.

==History==
[[Image:Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall 7, Jan 06.JPG|upright|thumb|left|The [[Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall]] as it appeared in January 2006. Victoria Theatre was the venue for the first public performance of "''Majulah Singapura''" on [[6 September]] [[1958]].]]

The composition of "''Majulah Singapura''" occurred during a push for independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. While Singapore was a [[British overseas territories#History|British colony]], its national anthem was "[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King (or Queen)]]". In 1951, the colony was conferred city status by a [[royal charter]] from [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]. In 1958, [[Ong Pang Boon]], the Deputy Mayor of the [[City Council of Singapore]], approached [[Zubir Said]] (1907&ndash;1987), a score arranger and songwriter with [[Cathay Organisation#Studios Production|Cathay-Keris Film Productions]], to compose a theme song for the Council's official functions to be titled "''Majulah Singapura''" ("Onward Singapore"). This phrase was chosen as it was a motto to be displayed in the [[Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall|Victoria Theatre]] after its renovation in 1958.<ref name="a2o">{{cite web|title=National anthem &ndash; Majulah Singapura|url=http://www.a2o.com.sg/a2o/public/html/etc/07_anthem.htm|publisher=Access to Archives Online (a2o), National Archives of Singapore|accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=National anthem originally for City Council|publisher=''[[The Straits Times]]''|date=[[1990-03-09]]|page=28}}</ref> 

Zubir took a year to finish composing the music and lyrics for the song. In a 1984 oral history interview, he recalled the process: "[T]he difficulty is in such a short melody, I have to put in all the words... [I]t must be very simple, understandable for all the races in Singapore... I consult also [''sic''] an author in Malay language so that I can do it in proper Malay language but not too deep and not too difficult.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zubir Said|authorlink=Zubir Said|title=Zubir Said [oral history interview, accession no. 292]|publisher=National Archives of Singapore|year=1984}} See {{cite web|title=National anthem &ndash; Majulah Singapura|url=http://www.a2o.com.sg/a2o/public/html/etc/07_anthem.htm|publisher=Access to Archives Online (a2o), National Archives of Singapore|accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> Summing up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb "''Di mana bumi dipijak, di situ langit dijunjung''" ("You should hold up the sky of the land where you live").<ref>''Zubir Said [oral history interview]'', above: {{cite web|title=1959 – Singapore's State Arms, Flags and National Anthem|url=http://40years.ns.sg/portal/ns/mindef_saf_history_1950s/1959_singapore_s_state_arms_flags_and_national_anthem/|publisher=NS40, [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of Defence]]|date=[[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> 

The completed composition was first performed on [[6 September]] [[1958]] by the Singapore Chamber Ensemble during the grand finale of a concert staged in the Victoria Theatre to celebrate its official reopening.<ref>{{cite web|title=First performance of National Anthem|url=http://www.singaporebookofrecords.com/singapore_records_individual.php?id=NjAwMDAwMTU3NA==|publisher=The Singapore Book of Records|accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> 

In 1959, [[Self-governance of Singapore|Singapore attained self-government]] and the City Council was dissolved. The Government felt that a [[national anthem]] was needed to unite the different races in Singapore. The [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Toh Chin Chye]] selected the City Council's song as it was already popular. At Toh's request, Zubir modified the lyrics and melody,<ref name="a2o"/> and the revised song was adopted by the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] on [[11 November]] [[1959]]. On [[30 November]] the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959<ref>Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 (No. 70 of 1959), now the {{Singapore Statute|title=Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act|cap=296|ed=1985}}.</ref> was passed to regulate the use and display of these national emblems. "''Majulah Singapura''" was formally introduced to the nation on [[3 December]] when [[Yusof bin Ishak]] was inaugurated as the ''[[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]]'', Singapore's [[head of state]]. At the same occasion, which also marked the launch of "Loyalty Week", the [[Flag of Singapore|national flag]] and the [[Coat of arms of Singapore|state crest]] were introduced. After Singapore's [[History of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|full independence from Malaysia]] on [[9 August]] [[1965]], "''Majulah Singapura''" was formally adopted as the Republic's national anthem.<ref name="Singapore Infopedia">{{cite web|last=Tan|first=Bonny|title=The Singapore National Anthem|url=http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_815_2004-12-23.html|publisher=Singapore Infopedia, [[National Library Board]]|date=[[2004-12-23]]|accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref>

===Salutes===
Previously, it was conventional for persons present when the national anthem was performed to stand with their arms by their sides. In recent years, at the government's encouragement, it has become customary to place one's right clenched fist over one's heart when the anthem is played or sung.<ref>"He [footballer Itimi Dickson] stood right at the end of the [[Singapore national football team|Lions]]' line-up, with his fist clenched over his chest while the strains of Majulah Singapura was played before last night's Singapore&ndash;Malaysia match": {{cite news|last=Lim|first=Leonard|title=This time he gets it right|url=http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,89446,00.html|publisher=''[[The New Paper]]''|date=[[2005-06-06]]}}</ref> 

Persons in military or paramilitary uniforms generally don their head dress and [[Salute#Hand salutes|salute]] on the first note of the anthem, holding the salute till the last note.

===Other uses===
The national anthem is played at the close of broadcasting hours on TV and radio in Singapore, although this use of the anthem has declined somewhat due to the emergence of 24-hour TV channels and radio stations.

The national anthem has lent its name<ref>"MC stands for Majulah Connection. In the Malay language, majulah means 'to progress.'

Interviewed by the Oral History Department in 1989, Dr. Toh Chin Chye said it was appropriate for the national anthem to be in Malay, "the indigenous language of the region, as English is not native to this part of the world."

All Singaporean children of kindergarten age have not only had no difficulty memorising the words but have for decades sung it every morning with 'strong feelings and emotion'." He also noted that the anthem had been translated into Singapore's three other official languages ([[English language|English]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) for those who cannot understand Malay.<ref name="ST: Raja"/> 

A subsequent poll by ''The Straits Times'' found that while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem should continue to be sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.<ref name="ST: Few understand lyrics"/> 

==Arrangements and recordings==
An abridged version of "''Majulah Singapura''" had been used by official bodies since 1965 although an expanded version, used only at grand ceremonial functions, exists. These versions were arranged by an Englishman, Michael Hurd. This arrangement was first recorded by the [[Singapore Symphony Orchestra]] under the baton of Lim Yau in 1989.<ref name="Singapore Infopedia"/><ref>The 1989 recording was released on compact disc as {{cite book|author=Zubir Said|authorlink=Zubir Said|title=Majulah Singapura: National anthem of Singapore [sound recording]|location=Singapore|publisher=[[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts|Ministry of Information and the Arts]]|year=1994}} It was contained in {{cite book|title=The National Symbols Kit|location=Singapore|publisher=Prepared by Programmes Section, [[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (Singapore)|Ministry of Information and the Arts]]|year=1999}}</ref> 

The original version of the national anthem was in the key of [[G major]], although in 1983 schools were issued an educational tape describing common mistakes made in singing the anthem and given the option of singing the anthem in [[F major]].<ref name="Singapore Infopedia"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Boey|first=Caroline|title=Learning to sing National Anthem again|publisher=''The Sunday Monitor''|date=[[1983-04-06]]}}</ref> In 1993, the shorter version of "''Majulah Singapura''" was declared to be the official one.<ref>{{cite news|title=Short version of anthem is official|publisher=''[[The Straits Times]]''|date=[[1993-05-08]]|page=32}}</ref>

The Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA, now the [[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts]] (MICA)) took more than a year to produce the new version. Its main objective was to make the anthem more accessible to all Singaporeans. In May 2000, several leading local composers were invited to rearrange the national anthem in F major. An evaluation panel headed by [[Bernard Tan]] selected the version submitted by [[Cultural Medallion]] winner Phoon Yew Tien. Phoon's [[orchestration]] employed a slower [[tempo]] and used more instruments to create a majestic rendition of the anthem.
