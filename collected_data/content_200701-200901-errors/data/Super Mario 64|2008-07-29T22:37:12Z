''Super Mario 64'' was the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] platform game in the ''[[Mario (series)|Mario]]'' series, and it established a new archetype for the genre, much as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' did for [[2D computer graphics|2D]] sidescrolling platformers. Hailed as "revolutionary", the game left a lasting impression on the 3D game design, particularly notable for its use of a dynamic camera system and the implementation of its analog control.<ref name="gamespotinf">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p15_01.html|title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time | publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/091/091398p1.html | title=N64 Reader Tributes: Super Mario 64 | publisher=[[IGN]]| accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref><ref name="1up1">{{cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3135350 |title = The Essential 50 Part 36: Super Mario 64 | publisher=[[1UP.com]]| accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref>

By going from two to three dimensions, ''Super Mario 64'' replaced the linear obstacle courses of traditional platform games with vast worlds in which the player must complete multiple and diverse missions, with an emphasis on exploration. While doing so, it managed to preserve many gameplay elements and characters of earlier ''Mario'' games.<ref name="1up1"/> It is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest and most revolutionary video games of all time.<ref name="IGN100-2003">{{cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2003/1-10.html| title=IGN's Top 100 Games| publisher=[[IGN]]| year=2003| accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref name="IGN100-2005">{{cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html| title=IGN's Top 100 Games| publisher=[[IGN]]| year=2005| accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref><ref name="IGN100-2007">{{cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html| title=IGN's Top 100 Games of All Time| publisher=[[IGN]]| year=2007| accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref  name="GI100">{{Citation |date= August 2001|title= Top 100 Games of All Time|periodical= [[Game Informer]]|pages= 36}}</ref><ref name="yahoo100">{{cite web| url = http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/specials/100games/1.html| title = The 100 Greatest Computer Games of All Time| publisher = [[Yahoo!

==Gameplay==
[[Image:N64 Super Mario 64 whomp fortress.jpg|thumb|left|Whomp's Fortress requires the player to navigate chasms, a classic ''Mario'' element.]]
''Super Mario 64'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[platform game|platformer]] where the player controls [[Mario]] through several courses. Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink "peace-loving" bomb-ombs). Mario gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after Mario has completed certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a [[boss (video games)|boss]], solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As Mario collects stars, more areas of the castle are opened.<ref name="playersguide"/><ref name="NP88">{{Citation |date= September 1996|title= Full Coverage&nbsp;— Super Mario 64|periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]|publisher= [[Nintendo]]|issue= 88|pages= 14–23}}</ref> Mario unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses.<ref name="playersguide"/>

Mario is assisted in some courses by three cap power-ups. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly, the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage and allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater and be unaffected by gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.<ref name="playersguide"/> Some courses contain [[cannon]]s that Mario can unlock by speaking to a pink [[List of Mario series enemies#Bob-omb|Bob-omb Buddy]]. After Mario enters a cannon, he can be shot out to reach distant places. When Mario has the Wing Cap, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly. There are many hidden secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely.

===Controls===
[[Image:Super Mario 64 jumping.jpg|thumb|Mario can perform a wide range of jumps among other moves.]]
Mario's abilities in ''Super Mario 64'' are far more diverse than those of previous ''Mario'' games. He can walk, run, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, and jump using the [[game controller]]'s [[analog stick]] and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the extra high double and triple jumps; jumping two and three times in a row, respectively, the long jump, and the [[somersault|backflip]]. There are also special maneuvers, such as [[wall jump]]ing; jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high.<ref name="playersguide"/><ref name="instructions"/> Mario can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles.<ref name="NP88"/> Mario can also swim underwater at various speeds. His life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath, and he must find coins or air bubbles to replenish it, or return to the surface before drowning.<ref name="playersguide"/> If Mario surfaces from underwater, he heals all of his damage regardless of the source, with the exception of icy water in some snow levels.

==Plot and setting==
''Super Mario 64'' is set in [[Princess Peach's Castle]], which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory area in which the player can experiment. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings.<ref name="NP88"/>

===Story===
''Super Mario 64'' begins with a letter from [[Princess Peach]] inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him.<ref>'''Princess Peach's note:''' Dear Mario: Please come to the castle. I've baked a cake for you. Yours truly-- Princess Toadstool, Peach {{cite video game| title = Super Mario 64| developer = [[Nintendo EAD]]| publisher = Nintendo | date= 1996-09-29| platform= Nintendo 64}}</ref> When he arrives, Mario discovers that [[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]] has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of 105 of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other realms, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario searches the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more stars, and will have to tackle three obstacle courses leading to a battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle, while the final battle releases Peach and rolls the credits. Peach rewards Mario by baking the cake that she had promised him.<ref name="playersguide">{{cite book|year=1996|title=Official Super Mario 64 Player's Guide|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref><ref name="instructions">{{cite book|year=1996|title=Super Mario 64 Instruction Booklet | publisher=Nintendo| id=NUS-NSME-USA}}</ref>

==Development==
The development of ''Super Mario 64'' took less than two years, but producer/director [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] had conceived of a 3D ''Mario'' game over five years before, while working on ''[[Star Fox (SNES)|Star Fox]]''.<ref name="interview">{{Citation| date= January 1996| title= The Game Guys - (Spaceworld 1995)| periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]|issue= 80| url= http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=interviews&id=1996-01-np080-miya-tezu&m=html}}</ref> Miyamoto developed most of the concepts during the era of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and considered making it a SNES game (making use of the [[Super FX]] chip), but decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the earlier system's technical limitations.<ref name="IGN100-2007"/><ref name=nsider>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=271|title=Profile: Shigeru Miyamoto Chronicles of a Visionary|publisher=[[N-Sider]]|author=Grajqevci, Jeton|accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref>

[[Image:Mario64 bowser level.jpg|thumb|left|"Bowser in the Dark World", one of the linear levels where Mario encounters Bowser.]]

The development of the game started with the creation of the characters and camera system. Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take, and months were spent selecting a camera view and layout that would be appropriate.<ref name="goddard interview">{{Citation| date= December 2001| title= The Making of Mario 64: Giles Goddard Interview| periodical= [[NGC Magazine]]| publisher= [[Future Publishing]]|issue= 61}}</ref> The original concept involved the game having fixed path much like an [[action-adventure game#Isometric adventure games|isometric]] type game (similar to ''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]''), before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design.<ref name="goddard interview"/> Although the majority of ''Super Mario 64'' would end up featuring the free-roaming design, elements of the original fixed path concept would remain in certain parts of the game, particularly in the three Bowser encounters. One of the programmers of ''Super Mario 64'', Giles Goddard, explained that these few linear elements survived as a means to force players into Bowser's lair rather than to encourage exploration.<ref name="goddard interview"/> The development team placed high priority on getting Mario's movements right, and before levels were created, the team was testing and refining Mario's animations on a simple grid. The first test scenario used to try out controls and physics involved Mario and a golden rabbit named "MIPS", which was included in the retail release of the game.

Shigeru Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy behind ''Super Mario 64'' was to "include more details" than found in games prior to the Nintendo 64.<ref name="interview"/> Some were inspired by real life. For example, one character is based on assistant director [[Takashi Tezuka]]'s wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time [Tezuka] spent at work. In the game, there is now a character which shrinks when Mario looks at it, but when Mario turns away, it will grow large and menacing."<ref>{{Citation| date= August 1995| title= Miyamoto Interview| periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]|issue= 75| url= http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0895.shtml}}</ref> ''Super Mario 64'' is also characterized by featuring more puzzles than earlier ''Mario'' games. It was developed simultaneously with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', but as the latter was released years later, some puzzles were taken from that game for ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="interview2">{{Citation| date= October 1996| title= Miyamoto Interview| periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]|issue= 89| url= http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/1096.shtml}}</ref>

[[Image:Super Mario 64 beta.jpg|thumb|Princess Peach's Castle in a pre-release version of ''Super Mario 64'']]

Information about ''Super Mario 64'' first leaked out in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the world premiere for the Nintendo 64 (then known as the "Ultra 64") at [[Nintendo Space World]]. The basic controls had at this point been implemented, and the game was reportedly 50% finished, although most of the course design remained. There were at least 32 courses planned, but the number turned out lower in the final game, as only 15 courses could fit in the game.<ref name="interview"/>

===Audio===
The music was composed by veteran [[Koji Kondo]], who used new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier games as well as entirely new material. ''Super Mario 64'' was one of the first games in the series to feature [[Charles Martinet]] as the voice of Mario. It also features the voices of Leslie Swan (then Senior Editor of [[Nintendo Power]]) as Princess Peach, who also wrote the English text for the game,<ref name="NP88-2">{{Citation |date= October 1996|periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]|publisher= [[Nintendo]]|issue= 89|pages= 67}}</ref> and [[Isaac Marshall]] as Bowser. The characters speak more in the English version than in the Japanese version.<ref name="interview2"/> In addition, dialog and some sounds differ between the Japanese and English versions. Some of these vocal changes for the English release were brought to the Japanese [[Rumble Pak]] edition. When ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' was released, all the voices were kept consistent in both the English and Japanese versions.

===Critical response===
''Super Mario 64'' has been critically acclaimed. The game is counted by [[1UP.com]] as one of the first games to have brought a series of 2D games into full 3D.<ref name="1up1"/> In the transition to 3D, many of the series conventions were rethought drastically, placing an emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping, or "hop and bop" action. While its quality was disputed by some, it has been argued that it established an entirely new genre, different from that of previous games in the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3211627.stm | title=Platform video games evolve | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2003-10-25 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' awarded the game a Gold award in its initial review,<ref name="EGM"/> and in ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' magazine, ''Super Mario 64'' was the first game to receive a perfect score.<ref name="EDGE35"/> ''Nintendo Power'' praised the graphics, sound, and gameplay, but commented the shifting camera angle took getting used to.<ref name="NP88-2">{{Citation |date= September 1996|title= Now Playing&nbsp;— September 1996|periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]|publisher= [[Nintendo]]|issue= 88|pages= 94–97}}</ref> ''Game Informer'' initially rated the game a 9.75,<ref>{{Citation| date= August 1996| title= | periodical= [[Game Informer]]| publisher= |issue= 40| pages= }}</ref> but re-rated it a 9.0 a decade later in their "Retro Review" section.<ref name="GI171"/> [[GameSpot]] called it one of the 15 most influential games of all time,<ref name="gamespotinf"/> and rated the Nintendo 64 version a score of 9.4 and the Wii Virtual Console version an 8.<ref name="GS-Review"/><ref name="GS-WiiReview">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermario64/review.html| title = Super Mario 64 for Wii Review| author = Gerstmann, Jeff| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| date = [[2006-11-20]]| accessdate = 2008-01-30}}</ref> The Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'', known for its harsh scoring, rated ''Super Mario 64'' a 39/40.<ref name="famitsu"/>

Michael Grayford of [[Liquid Entertainment]] stated he was initially "very turned off" by the openness of the game the first time he played it. Upon playing it later, he was "highly pleased" and stated "each level brought some new unique cool gameplay element and I was never bored".<ref name="GameSpy50">{{cite web | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july01/top502ase/index3.shtm| title=GameSpy's Top 50 Games of All Time | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | year=July 2001 | accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref> [[Warren Spector]], former lead designer at [[Ion Storm Inc.]], stated it was "not possible to squeeze this much gameplay into a single game" and "no game has done a better job of showing goals before they can be attained, allowing players to make a plan and execute on it". He also commented the exploration aspect of the game allowed players to "explore the same spaces several times while revealing something new each time is a revelation".<ref name="GameSpy50" /> ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' referred to the game as a "masterpiece of game design" and stated that Nintendo took its "number-one 2D franchise and convert it flawlessly into 3D".<ref name="ONM-5">{{Citation |date= July 2006| title= What do you mean, you've never played...

They also commented on the camera system stating that by present day standards the camera system "would almost be considered broken".<ref name="GI171"/>

==Impact and legacy==
Critics attribute the initial success of the Nintendo 64 console to ''Super Mario 64''. ''Edge'' magazine referred to it as the Nintendo 64's "key launch title".<ref name="Edge177">{{Citation |date= July 2007|title= Who Dares Wins|periodical= [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|publisher= [[Future Publishing]]|issue= 177|pages= 62–71}}</ref> ''Game Informer'' commented that the game helped the launch of the Nintendo 64.<ref name="GI171"/> ''Official Nintendo Magazine'' and GameDaily also attributed some of the initial excitement of the Nintendo 64 system to the release of ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="ONM-5"/><ref name="GD-Top25">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-greatest-nintendo-games/225/?page=19| title = Top 25 Greatest Nintendo Games - #7 Super Mario 64 (N64)| publisher = GameDaily| accessdate = 2008-02-09}}</ref> Though the system was initially very successful, it eventually lost much of its market share to Sony's [[PlayStation]]. 1UP.com attributed this decline to Nintendo's use of cartridges and the design of the [[Nintendo 64 controller]], which were reportedly implemented by Shigeru Miyamoto for ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="1up1"/> The game also set many precedents for 3D platformers to follow.<ref name="1up1"/><ref name="GWR08-2">{{cite book| last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= Craig Glenday| title= Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008| series= [[Guinness World Records]]| date= [[2008-03-11]]| publisher= Guinness| language= English|isbn= 978-1-904994-21-3| pages= 108–110| chapter= Record Breaking Games: Platform Games}}</ref> GameDaily listed the game as one of the "Most Influential Video Games" and stated it "defined the 3-D platform experience, influencing numerous designers to create their own, original offerings".<ref>{{cite web| title = Most Influential Video Games| url = http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/most-influential-video-games/168/?page=12| publisher = GameDaily| accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> ''[[GamesTM]]'' noted many game companies, including Nintendo, have tried to develop a platform game to match up to ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="gamesTM-63">{{citation| last= gamesTM Staff| first=| publication-date= November 2007| title=Super Mario Galaxy Review| periodical=[[gamesTM]]| publication-place= | publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]| issue=63| pages=129}}</ref> ''Super Mario 64'' was notable for its sense of freedom and [[linearity (computer and video games)|non-linearity]]. A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design was an inspiration for other game designers. For example, [[Martin Hollis]], who produced and directed ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'', says "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from ''Super Mario 64''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoonami.com/briefing/2004-09-02.php | title=The Making of GoldenEye 007 | publisher=[[Zoonami]]| date=2004-09-02 | accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref>

''Super Mario 64'' was the first game to have a "free" camera that could be controlled independently of the character.<ref name="GWR08-2"/> Most 3D games at the time used a [[first-person shooter|first-person]] perspective, or a camera that was fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level. To create freedom of exploration, and more fluid control in a 3D world, the designers created a dynamic system in which the [[professional video camera|video camera]] was operated by the in-game character [[List of Mario series enemies#Lakitu|Lakitu]].<ref name="instructions"/> ''Nintendo Power'' stated the camera-control scheme was what transitioned platform games into the 3D era.<ref name="WiiHandbook08">{{citation| title = Everything Old-School is New Again| issue = Winter Special 2008| periodical = [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher = [[Future Publishing]]| date = Winter 2008| pages = 42}}</ref> ''Edge'' stated the game changed "gamers' expectations of 3D movement forever".<ref name="Edge177"/> The camera system would become the standard for 3D platform games in the future.<ref name="NP88"/> The Nintendo 64's analog stick allowed for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital [[D-pad]]s of other consoles, and ''Super Mario 64'' used this in a way that was unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. ''Super Mario 64''{{'}}s controls were fully analog, and interpreted a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allowed for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs.<ref>{{Citation| date= June 1996| title= N64 Exclusive| periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]] |issue= 85| pages= 16–17}}</ref>

===Rumors===
Because of the game's popularity, rumors about glitches and secrets spread rapidly after its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64/Glitches|title=Super Mario 64 glitches at StrategyWiki|accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> The most common rumor is that Mario's brother [[Luigi]] is an unlockable character in the game. This rumor was fueled by some blurry text in the castle courtyard that supposedly read "L is real 2401". This caused rampant fan speculation that Luigi was playable. IGN received so many questions and supposed methods to unlock Luigi that the staff offered a US$100 bounty to anyone who could prove that Luigi was in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060383p1.html | title = In Search of Luigi| publisher=[[IGN]]| author = IGN Staff| date = [[1996-11-13]]| accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref> The number of false codes submitted to IGN dropped dramatically, and no successful method emerged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060392p1.html| title=Luigi Still Missing| publisher=[[IGN]]| author = IGN Staff| date = [[1996-11-20]]| accessdate = 2007-10-11}}</ref>

Nintendo has consistently denied Luigi's playability, and never commented on the meaning of "L is real 2401" except for the [[April Fools' Day]] 1998 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]''. In this issue, the "April News Briefs" section said that the cryptic phrase would be discussed on page 128, but the magazine only had 106 pages. The section also featured a facetious article entitled "Luigi 64", commenting humorously on the rumor.<ref name="npapr98">{{Citation| date= April 1998| title= April News Briefs| periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 107| pages= 80–81}}</ref> Luigi did however become playable in ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''.

===Sequels and remakes===
[[Image:SuperMario64ShindouEditiontitle.jpg|thumb|Super Mario 64 Rumble Pack version Title Screen.]]
''Super Mario 64'' was first re-released in Japan on [[July 18]], [[1997]] as {{nihongo|''Super Mario 64 Rumble Pak Support Version''|スーパーマリオ64 振動パック対応バージョン|Sūpā Mario Rokujūyon Shindō Pakku Taiō Bājon}}.

''[[Super Mario 64 2]]'' was planned for the [[Nintendo 64DD]], but was cancelled due to the failure of that peripheral, as well as a lack of progress in development.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/726/726761p1.html|title=Miyamoto Opens the Vault|publisher=[[IGN]]|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop| date=2006-08-21| accessdate = 2007-10-22}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] built on ''Super Mario 64'''s core gameplay by adding a water pump device and add-on nozzles, similar to the Caps.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=415| title = The Making of The Game Super Mario Sunshine| publisher = [[N-Sider]]| work = Nintendo Online Magazine | date = August 2002| accessdate = 2007-10-22}}</ref> The next 3D ''Mario'' platformer, ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', was released for the Wii in November 2007 and featured similar open ended gameplay.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/player/27584.html|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=2007-11-07|title=Super Mario Galaxy Video Review| accessdate = 2007-12-07}}</ref>

An [[video game remake|enhanced remake]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] called ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' was available for the launch of the Nintendo DS in 2004. [[Yoshi]], Luigi, and [[Wario]] were added as additional playable characters, and the game featured slightly altered graphics, additional stars and courses, [[touchscreen]] mini-games, and a few minor [[multiplayer game|multiplayer]] modes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/dssupermario4x4/review.html|title=Super Mario 64 DS Review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|last=Gerstmann|first=Jeff|date=2004-11-19|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> ''Super Mario 64'' can be downloaded on Wii's Virtual Console service, with a price of 1000 Wii Points.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733464p1.html | title=IGN's Nintendo Wii FAQ | last=Casamassina|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Casamassina | publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-09-19| pages=5 | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> This release adds compatibility with the [[Nintendo GameCube#Controller|Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Wii Remote#Classic Controller|Classic]] controllers, and enhances the display.<ref name="GS-WiiReview"/>
