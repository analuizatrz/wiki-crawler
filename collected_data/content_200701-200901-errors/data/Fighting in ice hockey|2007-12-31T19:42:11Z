Fighting is an established aspect of [[ice hockey]] in [[North America]], with a long history involving many levels of [[amateur sports|amateur]] and [[Professional sports|professional]] play and including some notable individual fights.<ref name="Bernstein_3">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=3}}</ref> Although a definite source of criticism, it is a considerable draw for the sport, and some fans attend games primarily to see fights.<ref name="Bernstein_36">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=36}}</ref> Fighting is usually performed by one or more [[enforcer (hockey)|enforcers]] on a given hockey team<ref name="Bernstein_xix">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=xix}}</ref> and is governed by a complex system of unwritten rules that players, [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]], [[Official (ice hockey)|officials]], and the media refer to as "the code".<ref name="Bernstein_xxi">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=xxi}}</ref><ref name="Morrison">{{Harvnb|Morrison|2007}}.</ref> Some fights are spontaneous, while others are premeditated by the participants.<ref name="Bernstein_31">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=31}}</ref> While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] on players who engage in fights. Unique to North American professional team sport, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting<ref name="Bernstein_31"/> but major European and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|collegiate hockey leagues]] do.<ref name="NCAA">{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|p=61}}</ref> Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.

Physical play in hockey, consisting of allowed techniques such as [[Checking (ice hockey)|checking]] and disallowed techniques such as [[elbowing]], [[Penalty (ice hockey)#List of penalties|high sticking]], and [[Penalty (ice hockey)#List of penalties|cross-checking]], is inextricably linked to fighting.<ref name="Bernstein_4">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=4}}</ref> Broadly speaking, fighting exists in organized ice hockey to help deter overly rough play, to allow teams to protect their star players, and to create a sense of solidarity among teammates.<ref name="Bernstein_xxi"/> 
It is possible for players to become notable solely for their fighting ability. These players are known as "enforcers".
The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing, with most players, administrators, and fans favoring condoned [[Bare-knuckle boxing|fisticuffs]]. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or "heavyweights") knocking each other out, administrators are not considering eliminating fighting from the game, since most players consider it essential.<ref name="McIntyre">{{Harvnb|McIntyre|2007}}</ref> Additionally, the majority of fans oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games.<ref name="Barrie Examiner">{{Harvnb|Barrie Examiner|2007}}</ref> However, considerable opposition to fighting exists and efforts to eliminate it continue.

Fighting has been a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in popularity in 19th century [[Canada]].<ref name="Bernstein_3"/> There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game, the most common of which being that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control.<ref name="Bernstein_3"/> The implementation of some features, such as the [[Hockey rink|blue lines]] in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play.  Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone.  Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play.  The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.<ref name="Bernstein_4"/>

In 1922, the NHL introduced Rule 56 which formally regulated fighting, or "[[Bare-knuckle boxing|fisticuffs]]" as it was called in the official NHL rulebook. Rather than ejecting players from the game, as was the practice in amateur and collegiate hockey, players would be given a [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Types of penalties|five-minute major penalty]]. Rule 56 and its language also filtered down to the minor professional and junior leagues in North America.<ref name="Bernstein_4"/> Promoters such as [[George Lewis Rickard|Tex Rickard]] of [[Madison Square Garden]], who also promoted [[boxing]] events, saw financial opportunities in hockey fights and devised [[marketing]] campaigns around the rivalries between various team enforcers.<ref name="Bernstein_5">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=5}}</ref>

In the current NHL rulebook, the archaic reference to 'fisticuffs' has been removed; fighting is now governed under Rule 47 in the [http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf NHL rulebook]. Referees are given considerable latitude in determining what exactly constitutes a fight and what penalties are applicable to the participants. Significant modifications from the original rule involve penalties which can be assessed to a fight participant deemed to have instigated the fight and additional penalties resulting from instigating a fight while wearing a face-shield.

Though fighting was rarer from the 1920s through the early 1960s, it was more brutal than it is today.  Star players were also known to fight for themselves since fewer professional teams existed and competition was fierce for roster spots.  Therefore, enforcers did not typically make professional teams.  However, with the NHL expansion in the late 1960s and the emergence of skilled players like [[Wayne Gretzky]], enforcers became more common. The average number of fights per game rose above 1.0 during the 1980s.<ref name="Morrison"/> Many teams signed enforcers such as [[Dave Semenko]], [[Marty McSorley]], and [[Stu Grimson]] to protect and fight for smaller offensive players such as Gretzky, [[Paul Kariya]], and [[Teemu Selänne]].<ref name="Bernstein_33">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=33}}</ref>

Since the 1970s, three rules have curtailed the number and scope of fights in the NHL. In 1977, the league created the "Third Man In" rule which attempts to eliminate the [[bench-clearing brawl]] by providing for the ejection of the first player that joins a fight already in progress.<ref name="NHL_Rulebook_56">{{Harvnb|NHL_Rulebook_56|2007}}</ref> Another rule automatically suspends the first player from each team that leaves the bench to join a fight when it is not their shift.<ref name="NHL_Rulebook_72">{{Harvnb|NHL_Rulebook_72|2007}}</ref> As of the 2006–07 season, the "Instigator" rule, which adds an additional two-minute minor penalty to the player who starts a fight,<ref name="NHL_Rulebook_56"/> has contributed to the decline of fighting in the NHL. As of the 2006–07 season, the average is just over .61 fights per game.<ref name="Morrison"/>

== Rules and penalties ==
<!-- [[Image:Frölunda Västerås U18 Fight(2).jpg|thumb|right|A fight during a [[Frölunda HC]] &ndash; [[VIK Västerås HK]] game]] -->
Fighting is illegal in the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues, where a five-minute major penalty is given. What separates these leagues from other hockey leagues and nearly all other sports is that they do not eject players simply for participating in a fight. However, fighting is punishable by ejection in the Peewee, College and European leagues, Olympic competition, and in women's hockey at any level. 

The rulebooks of the NHL and other professional leagues contain specific rules for fighting. These rules state that at the initiation of a fight, both players must drop their sticks so as not to use them as a weapon. Players must also "drop" or shake off their protective gloves in order to fight bare-knuckled (essentially, "throwing down the [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]"), as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves would increase the effect of landed blows. Players must also heed a referee warning to end a fight once the opponents have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty and the possibility of fines and suspension from future games.<ref name="NHL_Rulebook_56"/>

In many leagues, referees will permit a fight between two players to run its course until one or both players end up on the ice.  Referees will actively try to break up fights involving more than two participants or multiple fights.

=== North American professional leagues ===
In the NHL, [[American Hockey League]], [[ECHL]], [[Central Hockey League|CHL]], [[International Hockey League (2007-)|International Hockey League]], and other notable minor leagues, officials punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase "five for fighting"). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries to leave the bench to join a fight, and is also automatically ejected for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, or wrapping tape around one's hands), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties or participates in three fights in a single game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.<ref name="Bernstein_4"/><ref name="NHL_Rulebook_72"/>

A player who commits three major penalties, including fighting, during a game is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes.<ref name="Bernstein_4"/>

In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.<ref name="NHL_Rulebook_72"/>

=== European, Collegiate, and Olympic ===
In Division I & III [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] hockey, the fighters are given a Game Disqualification, which is an ejection from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications during the course of a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from the game and then suspended for his team's next two games. This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.

Fighting is prohibited in [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympic ice hockey]]<ref name="Rodrigues">{{Harvnb|Rodrigues|2006}}</ref> and in European professional hockey leagues.<ref name="Brownlee">{{Harvnb|Brownlee|2007}}</ref> The international rules (by [[IIHF]]) specify in the rule 528 – ''Fisticuffs or Roughing''<ref name="IIHF_528">{{Harvnb|IIHF|2006|p=73}}</ref> the following penalties (among others):
* Match penalty (the player is ejected from the game and another player serves 5 minutes on the penalty bench) for a player who starts fisticuffs. <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:2005 UCLA vs USC fight.jpg|thumb|right|A fight in a collegiate game between UCLA and USC.]] -->
* Minor penalty (2 minutes) for a player who retaliates with a blow or attempted blow.
* Game misconduct penalty (ejection from the game) in addition to any other penalties for any player who is the first to intervene in a fight which is already in progress.
* Double minor penalty (4 minutes), major penalty + game misconduct penalty (5 minutes and ejection from the game), or match penalty (at the discretion of the referee) for a player who continues the fighting after being told by the referee or a linesman to stop.
* Misconduct penalty (cannot play for 10 minutes; the second misconduct penalty in one game means automatic ejection) for a player who intentionally takes off his gloves in a fight.

== Enforcers ==
{{main|Enforcer (hockey)}}
The role of "enforcer" on a hockey team is unofficial but crucial to the game.<ref name="Bernstein_xix"/> Enforcers occasionally play regular shifts like other players, but their primary role is deterring opposing players from rough play.  Coaches often send enforcers out when opposing enforcers are on the ice or any time when it is necessary to check excessively physical play by the opposing team.<ref name="Bernstein_34"/>
Historical players who have made a name for themselves within the sport by frequently engaging in fights include [[Red Horner]], [[Lou Fontinato]], [[John Ferguson, Sr.|John Ferguson]], [[Dave Schultz (ice hockey)|Dave Schultz]], and [[Tiger Williams]]; modern-day players include [[Tony Twist]], [[Marty McSorley]], [[Rob Ray]], [[Tie Domi]], [[Kelly Chase]], [[Georges Laraque]], [[Ken Baumgartner]], [[Donald Brashear]], [[Joe Kocur]] and [[Bob Probert]].<ref name="Allen_x">{{Harvnb|Allen|1999|p=x}}</ref> Enforcers, particularly those with questionable playing skills, can be colloquially referred to as goons.

== Causes ==
There are many reasons for fights during a hockey game. Some reasons are related to game play, such as retaliation, momentum-building, intimidation, deterrence, attempting to draw "reaction penalties", and protecting star players.  There are also some personal reasons such as retribution for past incidents, bad blood between players, and simple job security for enforcers.<ref name="Bernstein_34">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=34}}</ref>

=== Game-related reasons ===
[[Image:hockeyfight.JPG|thumb|right|A large fight in an [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]] hockey game between the [[Sudbury Wolves]] and [[Ottawa 67s]]]] 
Of the many reasons for fighting, the foremost is for retaliation.<ref name="Bernstein_34"/> When players engage in play that members of the opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue.  On rare occasions, the fight may be between the assailant and the victim or between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, but most of the time the fight is between any two opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games.<ref name="Bernstein_34"/> Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a [[Powerplay|power play]] due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.<ref name="Bernstein_35">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=35}}</ref>

Enforcers sometimes start fights to build game momentum and provide a psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition.<ref name="Bernstein_36"/> This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often gets the home crowd into the game as well. For that reason, it can also be a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.<ref name="Bernstein_38">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=38}}</ref>

Intimidation is an important element of a hockey game<ref name="Bernstein_xix"/> and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players.<ref name="Bernstein_41">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=41}}</ref> For example, in the late 1950s, [[Gordie Howe]] helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career.<ref>{{Harvnb|Legends of Hockey|2007}}</ref> Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwartz|2007}}</ref> After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players.<ref name="Bernstein_42">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=42}}</ref> Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines.  Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.<ref name="McIntyre"/>

For teams that face each other frequently, players may fight just to send the message to the opposing players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games.<ref name="Bernstein_46">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=46}}</ref> Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights near the end of the game when they have nothing to lose.<ref name="Bernstein_47">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=47}}</ref> Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a "reaction penalty", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.<ref name="Bernstein_48">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=48}}</ref>

Another reason is the protection of star players. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Semenko, McSorley and others, and [[Brett Hull]], who was protected by Chase and others.<ref name="Bernstein_53">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=53}}</ref>  The [[National Hockey League|NHL]] averaged twice as many fights during Gretzky's prime with the [[Edmonton Oilers]] than it did during the 1970s; some sources credit Gretzky with being a major cause in the statistical rise.<ref name="Bernstein_51">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=51}}</ref>

=== Personal reasons ===
Many young enforcers need to establish their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs.<ref name="Bernstein_50">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=50}}</ref>  Due to the [[Farm team|farm systems]] that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who get a chance to play at the level above their current one (for example, an [[American Hockey League]] player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team.<ref name="Botterill">{{Harvnb|Botterill|2004}}</ref>

There are also times when players and even entire teams carry on personal rivalries that have little to do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason.<ref name="Bernstein_55">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=55}}</ref> An infamous rivalry that produced many fights was between the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Colorado Avalanche]] during the 1990s.<ref name="Dater_Feud">{{Harvnb|Dater|2006}}</ref>

==Efforts to ban fighting==
Criticism of fighting in ice hockey typically arises after acts of violence committed during fights are singled out in the media.  For example, on [[March 21]], [[2007]], [[Colton Orr]] of the [[New York Rangers]] fought with [[Todd Fedoruk]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and ended up knocking him [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].

Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight earlier in the season. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban.<ref name="Dater">{{Harvnb|Dater|2007}}</ref><ref name="Orr">{{Harvnb|Associated Press|2007}}</ref> Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue;<ref name="Lebrun">{{Harvnb|Lebrun|2007}}</ref> however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey.<ref name="Dater"/> Some league administrators, such as NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey)|Colin Campbell]], have been circulating and considering the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk-Orr fight.<ref name="Naylor">{{Harvnb|Naylor|2007}}</ref>

Some sports journalists have been articulating the idea with increasing frequency during the 2006–07 NHL season that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike,<ref name="Wilson">{{Harvnb|Wilson|2007}}</ref> is a "knee-jerk" reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game,<ref name="Jenkinson">{{Harvnb|Jenkinson|2007}}</ref> and that it is simply a waste of time.<ref name="Gough">{{Harvnb|Gough|2007}}</ref> Opponents of fighting cite that international and college hockey, which both harshly penalize fighting with suspensions, lack the incidents or "stick work" violence proponents claim to fear, and question what it is about North American professional ice hockey players &mdash; unique to major professional team sport &mdash; that renders them incapable of controlling themselves on the ice without fighting.<ref name="Klein">{{Harvnb|Klein|1986}}</ref>

Community members often become involved in the debate over banning fighting.  In December 2006, a [[school board]] trustee in [[London, Ontario]] attended a [[London Knights]] game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it.  This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the [[Ontario Hockey League]], where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators.<ref name="Rodrigues"/> On the advice of its [[Medical Health Officer]], the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pollett|2007}}</ref>

== Etiquette ==
<!-- [[Image:VandenBussche Barth.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[New Mexico Scorpions|New Mexico Scorpion]] Ryan VandenBussche fights with Chris Barth]] -->
There are several informal rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously.<ref name="Bernstein_56">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=56}}</ref> The most important aspect of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.<ref name="Bernstein_57">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=57}}</ref>

Enforcers typically only fight each other, with only the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight.<ref name="Bernstein_60">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=60}}</ref>  Enforcers spend time researching the techniques and weaknesses of other enforcers, and many carry on long-standing rivalries.<ref name="Bernstein_61">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=61}}</ref> There is a high degree of respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory.<ref name="Bernstein_100">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=100}}</ref> This is also known as granting a "free pass".<ref name="Bernstein_65">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=65}}</ref>

Long-standing rivalries result in numerous rematches, especially if one of the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is one of the reasons that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents.<ref name="Bernstein_69">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=69}}</ref> On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.<ref name="Bernstein_70">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=70}}</ref>

Another important aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks,<ref name="Bernstein_74">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=74}}</ref> not pulling the opposing fighter's jersey over his head, and not assaulting referees or linesmen.<ref name="Bernstein_73">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=73}}</ref> Finally, whatever the outcome of the fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans.<ref name="Bernstein_76">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=76}}</ref>

== Tactics ==
[[Image:Sabres Ice Dogs fight.jpg|250px|right|thumbnail|"Line Brawl" in [[SIJHL]] Jr. "A" game between [[Fort Frances Jr. Sabres]] and [[Dryden Ice Dogs]].]]
Fighting tactics are governed by several actual rules, and enforcers also adopt informal tactics particular to their style and personality. 

One tactic adopted by players is known as "going for it", in which the player puts his head down and just throws as many punches as he can, as fast as he can.  In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead.  Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.<ref name="Bernstein_62">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=62}}</ref>  Enforcers such as [[Darren McCarty]] advocate letting the opposing enforcer get a few punches in before putting in maximum effort, and assert that fighting is as much about knowing how to take a punch as it is about delivering punches.<ref name="Spence">{{Harvnb|Spence|2003}}</ref>

Other examples include Gordie Howe's tactic of holding the sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement.  Bob Probert, of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]], was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight.  Some consider long-time enforcer [[Rob Ray]] to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with tie-down straps that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to.  This is commonly referred to as the "Rob Ray Rule".<ref name="Bernstein_63">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=63}}</ref>
<!--

Please cite this: In contrast to fighting on solid ground, some of the force of punches landed in hockey fights is dissipated in the sliding of a players' skates on the ice. Boxing trainers stress the importance of strong legs and firmly planted feet so that maximum force can be delivered into a punch, and this potential is largely lost in the ice-based punch. For this reason, most of the damage inflicted in hockey fighting consists of bruises and lacerations, rather than the major injuries incurred by punches successfully landed in other venues.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

== Notable fights and brawls==
Some fights have attracted significant media attention due to injuries sustained by one or both participants and other factors.
* [[Maurice Richard|Maurice "Rocket" Richard]] knocked out enforcer [[Bob Dill]] twice in one game.  Dill had been hired by the New York Rangers specifically to rough up Richard.<ref name="Fisher">{{Harvnb|Fisher|2007}}</ref>
*[[World Hockey Association]] [[Birmingham Bulls]] enforcer [[Dave Hanson (ice hockey)|Dave Hanson]], known for his 11-year professional career and role in the movie ''[[Slap Shot (film)|Slap Shot]]'', fought [[Hockey Hall of Fame|hall of famer]] [[Bobby Hull]] of the [[Winnipeg Jets]] and in the process got Hull's wig caught in his knuckles. The incident landed Hanson in the news, and irate Winnipeg fans attempted to assault him on his way out of the arena.<ref name="Bernstein_77">{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=77}}</ref>
* [[April 20]], [[1984]] - A second-round playoffs matchup between the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]] became a team melee at the end of the second period, after many smaller scaled battles had occurred throughout the game. The teams erupted into battle again before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties and misconducts. A total of 250 penalty minutes and 10 game misconducts were handed out. This game prompted referee [[Bruce Hood]] to retire from the NHL once the playoffs ended.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lemieux|2003}}</ref>
* [[January 4]], [[1987]] - A [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] game between [[Canada]] and the [[Soviet Union]]  was the scene of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it.  The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. The incident caused both teams to be ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and both teams were also barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.<ref name="CBC">{{Harvnb|CBC|1987}}</ref> A book by Gare Joyce was written regarding the event.<ref name="Joyce">{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006}}</ref>
* [[March 26]], [[1997]], [[Red Wings-Avalanche brawl 1997|Bloody Wednesday]] - The Avalanche and the Red Wings engaged in nine fights, including bouts between Darren McCarty and [[Claude Lemieux]] and [[Goaltender|goalies]] [[Patrick Roy]] and [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]]. Lemieux, once ranked by [[ESPN]] as the NHL's most hated player, did not drop his gloves and instead bent down to his knees, and covered his head with his gloves to protect himself &mdash; a maneuver known as "turtling".<ref name="Neumann">{{Harvnb|Neumann|2007}}</ref>
* [[February 9]], [[2001]] - A game between the [[Nottingham Panthers]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] saw "one of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink." when Sheffield enforcer [[Dennis Vial]] crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden. Panthers enforcer [[Barry Nieckar]] subsquently fought with Vial which eventually escalated into a 36 man bench clearance brawl. Referee Moray Hanson was left with little option but to delay the game for 45 minutes while tempers cooled. Eight players were ejected from the game following the incident. A total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period, a British record for a single period.<ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 2001 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author = CBC | title = British league suspends Canadian hockey brawlers | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/14/brawlers010214.html | accessdate = 2007-12-24 | publisher = cbc.ca | date = 2001 }}</ref>
* [[March 5]], [[2004]] - A Philadelphia Flyers &ndash; [[Ottawa Senators]] game resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie [[Robert Esche]] and Senators goalie [[Patrick Lalime]]. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes.<ref name="Maaddi">{{Harvnb|Maaddi|2004}}</ref>
* [[February 22]], [[2007]] - Every player on the ice in a [[Buffalo Sabres]] and Ottawa Senators game, including goalies [[Martin Biron]] and [[Ray Emery]] fought following an unpenalized hit and injury to Sabres captain [[Chris Drury]]. More than 100 penalty minutes were distributed<ref name="Associated Pressl">{{Harvnb|Associated Press|2007}}</ref> Sabres coach [[Lindy Ruff]] was fined $10,000 by the NHL. He admitted to sending out a line of enforcers against Ottawa's skilled players and instructing them to "Go out and run 'em."<ref name="Canadian Press">{{Harvnb|Canadian Press|2007}}</ref> Ruff also went over the glass and admonished Sens coach [[Bryan Murray (ice hockey)|Bryan Murray]], where (former enforcer) [[Rob Ray]]'s [[MSG Network]] microphone picked up the Buffalo coach yelling to his counterpart, "Don't go after my fucking captain!"

* Fighting is a popular component of [[Don Cherry (ice hockey)|Don Cherry]]'s ''Rock 'em Sock 'em Hockey'' video-highlight series. Cherry has made 19 editions of the series which has sold more than a million videos.<ref name="Maclean's">{{Harvnb|Maclean's|}}</ref>
* The [[Battle of the Hockey Enforcers]] involved [[Link Gaetz]] and featured just fights on ice but with no actual hockey played. The City of [[Prince George, British Columbia]] tried but failed to cancel the 2005 sporting event at the city-owned arena.<ref name="Joyce, Greg">{{Harvnb|Joyce|2005}}</ref>
* In 2007, [[Derek Boogaard]] of the [[Minnesota Wild]] started hockey fighting camps for children, complete with T-shirts splattered with pretend blood. Boogaard argued that the focus was on teaching players how to protect themselves while critics argued that it contradicted efforts to renew youth interest in joining leagues.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blount|2007}}</ref>
