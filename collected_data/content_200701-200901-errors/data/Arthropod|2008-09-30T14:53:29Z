'''Arthropods''' are [[animal]]s belonging to the [[Scientific classification|Phylum]] '''Arthropoda''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:ἄρθρον|ἄρθρον]] ''arthron'', "[[joint]]", and [[wikt:ποδός|ποδός]] ''podos'' "[[foot]]", which together mean "jointed feet") and include the [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, crustaceans and others. Arthropods are characterized by the possession of a jointed limbs and of [[cuticle]]s which are mainly made of α-[[chitin]]; [[crustacea]]ns' cuticles are also [[biomineralization| biomineralized]] with [[calcium carbonate]]. The cuticle is so rigid that it would inhibit growth, and arthropods replace it periodically by [[molt]]ing. Arthropods' [[body plan]] of repeated [[Segment (biology)|segment]]s, each with a pair of [[appendage]]s, is so versatile that they have been compared to [[Swiss Army knives]], and has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology) |ecological guild]]s in most environments; they have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living species. In fact they are one of only two groups that are very successful in dry environments – the other is [[amniote]]s. They range in size from microscopic [[plankton]] up to forms a few [[metre]]s long.

Although arthropods are [[coelomate]]s, their main internal cavity is a [[hemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy) | organ]]s and though which their [[blood]] circulates – they have [[Circulatory_system#Open_circulatory_system | open circulatory system]]s. Like their exteriors, arthropods' internal organs are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] are "ladder-like", with paired [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Dorsal_and_ventral | ventral]] [[nerve cord]]s running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of these segments' ganglia and encircle the [[esophagus]]. Arthropods' [[respiratory system | respiratory]] and [[excretion | excretory]] systems vary, depending almost as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong. Arthropods' vision relies on various combinations of [[compound]] eyes and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information; but [[spider]]s' main eyes are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. They also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many [[seta]]e (bristles) that project through their cuticles.

Their methods of reproduction and development are similarly diverse. All terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage of the ground, rather by direct injection. Aquatic species use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Almost all lay eggs, but [[scorpion]]s give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mothers. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and [[caterpillar]]s that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from zero to prolonged, as in scorpions.

The versatility of arthropods' modular body plan has made it difficult for [[zoologist]]s and [[paleontologist]]s to classify them and work out their evolutionary ancestry, which dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. From the late 1950s to late 1970s it was widely though that arthropods were [[polyphyletic]], in other words there was no single arthropod ancestor. Now, however, they are generally regarded as [[monophyletic]]. Traditionally it was thought that arthropods' closest evolutionary relatives were [[annelid]] worms, as both groups have segmented bodies. It is now generally thought that arthropods belong to the [[superphylum]] [[Ecdysozoa]] ("animals that molt"), while annelids belong to another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]]. The relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated.

Estimating the total number of living species is extremely difficult because it often depends on a series of assumptions to scale up to the whole world from counts at specific locations. However a study in 1992 estimated that there were 500,000 species in Costa Rica alone, of which 365,000 were arthropods.<ref name="Thompson1994CoevolutionaryProcess" />

The [[embryo]]s of all arthropods are segmented, built from a series of repeated modules. The last common ancestor of living arthropods probably consisted of a series of undifferentiated segments, each with a pair of appendages that functioned as limbs.

The original structure of arthropod appendages was probably [[biramous]], with the upper branch acting as a [[gill]] while the lower branch was used for walking.

They contain an inner zone ([[procuticle]]), which is made of protein and chitin and is responsible for the strength of the exoskeleton. The outer zone ([[epicuticle]]) lies on the surface of the procuticle. It is non-chitinous and is a complex of [[proteins]] and [[lipids]]. It provides the moisture proofing and protection to the procuticle. The exoskeleton takes the form of plates called ''[[sclerite]]s'' on the segments, plus rings on the appendages that divide them into segments separated by joints. This is in fact what gives arthropods their name — jointed feet — and separates them from their relatives, the [[Onychophora]] and [[Tardigrada]], also called [[Lobopoda]] (and which is sometimes included in a group called [[Panarthropoda]] that also includes arthropods). The exoskeletons of arthropods strengthen them against attack by predators and are impermeable to water. In order to grow, an arthropod must shed its old exoskeleton and secrete a new one. This process, [[ecdysis]], is expensive in terms of energy, and during the molting period, an arthropod is vulnerable.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} -->

The exoskeletons of most aquatic [[crustacean]]s are [[biomineralization| biomineralized]] with [[calcium carbonate]] extracted from the water. Some terrestrial crustaceans have developed means of storing the mineral, to deal with the unavailability of dissolved calcium carbonate.<ref>{{cite book

The cuticle can have [[seta]]e (bristles) growing from special cells in the epidermis. Setae are as varied in form and function as appendages, for example: they are often used as sensors to detect air or water currents, or contact with objects; aquatic arthropods use [[feather]]-like setae to increase the surface area of swimming appendages and to [[filter feeding | filter]] food particles out of water; aquatic insects, which are air-breathers, use thick [[felt]]-like coats of setae to trap air, extending the time they can spend under water; heavy, rigid setae serve  as defensive spines.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518" />

Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, some still use [[hydraulic]] pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors<ref>{{cite book

===Molting===
The exoskeleton cannot stretch and thus restricts growth. Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by [[molt]]ing, in other words shedding the old exoskelton after growing a new one which is not yet hardened. Molting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524">{{cite book

}}</ref>

In the initial phase of molting , the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases [[molting fluid]], a mixture of [[enzyme]]s that digests the [[endocuticle]] and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the [[epidermis]] has secreted a new [[epicuticle]] to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking a large quantity of water or air,  and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials. <ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524" />

Because arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and and of being attacked by predators. Molting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524" />

Arthropods' bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory and excretory systems have repeated components.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518" /> Arthopods come from a lineage of animals that have a [[coelom]], in other words a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. However arthropods' strong segmented limbs eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]] which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence arthropods' coelom is reduced to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a [[hemocoel]], a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which [[blood]] flows.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528">{{cite book

Arthropods have open [[circulatory system]]s - although most have a few short, open-ended [[artery | arteries]]. In chelicerates and crustaceans the blood carries [[oxygen]] to the tissues, while [[hexapod]]s use a separate system of [[Invertebrate trachea | trachea]]e. Many crustaceans but few chelicerates and [[tracheata | tracheate]]s use [[respiratory pigment]]s to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is [[copper]]-based [[hemocyanin]]: this is is used by many crustaceans and a few [[centipede]]s. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based [[hemoglobin]], the respiratory pigment used by [[vertebrate]]s. As with other invertebrates and unlike among vertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in [[Blood cell | corpuscles]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528" />

The heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Elastic ligaments or small muscles connect the heart to the body wall and expand sections that are not being squeezed by the the heart muscle. Along the heart runs a series of paired [[Ostium | ostia]], non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528" />

Arthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many archnids have [[book lung]]s. Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and [[arachnid]]s.<ref>{{cite book

Living arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segent the cords form a pair of [[ganglia]] from which [[sensory nerve | sensory]] and [[motor nerve | motor]] nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic "ladder-like" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the [[esophagus]]. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head - a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of subesophageal ganglia, under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the segmental ganglia are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front "super-segment").<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532">{{cite book

There are two different types of arthropod excretory system. In aquatic arthropod the end-product of biochemical reactions that [[metabolism | metabolise]] [[nitrogen]] is [[ammonia]], which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills. All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for crustaceans' relative lack of success as land animals.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530">{{cite book

| publisher=Brooks / Cole | edition=7 | isbn=0030259827 | date=2004 | pages=529-530 
}}</ref>  Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is [[uric acid]], which can be excreted as dry material; [[Malphigian tubules]] filter the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the homecoel, and dump these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as [[feces]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530" /> Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called [[nephridia]] ("little [[kidney]]s"), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530" /> 

===Senses===
Arthropods stiff [[cuticle]]s would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly [[seta]]e respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[smell]], often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of [[membrane]]s that function as [[eardrum]]s, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to [[auditory ossicle]]s. The [[Antenna (biology)| antenna]]e of most [[hexapod]]s include sensor packages that monitor [[humidity]], moisture and temperature. <ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537">{{cite book

<!--

Most arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-cup [[ocelli]] ("little eyes"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However the main eyes of [[spider]]s are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" /> and those of [[jumping spider]]s can rotate to track prey.<ref>{{cite book

Compound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent [[ommatidia]], columns that are usually  [[hexagon]]al in [[cross-section]]. Each ommatidium is an independent sensor, with its own light-sensitive cells and often with its own [[lens]] and [[cornea]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" /> Compound eyes have a wide field of view, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the [[polarization]] of light.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> On the other hand the relatively large size of ommatidia makes the images rather coarse, and compound eyes are shorter-sighted than those of birds and mammals – although this is not a severe disadvantage, as objects and events within {{convert|20|cm|in}} are most important to most arthropods.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" /> Several arthropods have color vision, and that of some insects has been studied in detail - for example bees' ommatidia contain receptors for both green and [[ultra-violet]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" />

Most arthropods lack balance and [[acceleration]] sensors and rely on their eyes to  tell them which way is up. The self-righting behavior of [[cockroach]]es is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure. However many [[malacostracan]] [[crustacean]]s have [[statocyst]]s, which provide the same sort of information as the balance and motion sensors of the vertebrate [[inner ear]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" />

Arthropods' [[proprioceptor]]s, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints, are well understood. On the other hand little is known about what other internal sensors Arthropods may have.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" />

==Reproduction and development==
[[Image:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|150px|right|thumb|''Compsobuthus werneri'' female with young (white)]]
A few arthropods, such as [[barnacle]]s, are [[hermaphroditic]], in other words can function as both [[sex]]es. However individuals of most species remain of one sex all their lives. Aquatic arthropods may breed by [[external fertilization]], as for example [[frog]]s do, or by [[internal fertilization]], where the [[ovum | ova]] remain in the female's body and the [[sperm]] must must somehow be inserted. All known terrestrial arthropods use internal fertilization, as unprotected sperm and ova would not survive long in these environments. In a few cases the sperm transfer is direct from the male's [[penis]] to the female's [[oviduct]], but it is more often indirect. Some crustaceans and spiders use modified appendages to transfer the sperm to the female. On the other hand many male terrestrial arthropods produce [[spermatophore]]s, water-proof packets of sperm, and then the females take these into their bodies. A few such species rely on females to find spermatophores that have already been deposited on the ground, but in most cases males only deposit spermatophores when complex [[courtship]] rituals look likely be successful.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P537To539">{{cite book

Newly-born arthropods have similarly diverse forms. Insects alone cover the range of extremes: some hatch as apparently miniature adults ([[direct development]]), although in some cases, such as [[silverfish]], the hatchlings do not feed and may be helpless until after their first molt; many insects hatch as grubs or [[caterpillar]]s which do not have segmented limbs or hardened cuticles, and [[metamorphosis | metamorphose]] into adult forms by entering an inactive phase in which the larval tissues are broken down and re-used to build the adult body;<ref>{{cite journal

==Evolution ==
[[Image:31-Velvet Worm.JPG|thumb|left|The [[velvet worm|velvet worm (Onychophora)]] is closely related to Arthropods<ref name="Budd1996" />]]
From the late 1950s to the late 1970s Sidnie Manon and others argued that arthropods were [[polyphyletic]], in other words they do not share a common ancestor ''that was itself an arthropod''. Instead they proposed that three separate groups of "arthropods" evolved separately from worm-like ancestors: the [[chelicerate]]s, including [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s; the [[crustacean]]s; and the [[uniramia]], consisting of [[onychophoran]]s, [[myriapod]]s and [[hexapod]]s – these arguments usually bypassed [[trilobite]]s, whose evolutionary relationships were unclear. Proponents of polyphly argued that: the similarities between these groups are the results of [[convergent evolution]], as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented [[exoskeleton]]s; the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; there were significant differences in the construction of their [[compound eyes]]; it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; crustaceans have [[biramous]] limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have [[uniramous]] limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.<ref>{{cite book

</div>Relationships of [[Ecdysozoa]] to each other and to [[annelid]]s, etc.<ref name="TelfordBourlatEtAl2008EvolutionOfEcdysozoa" /></div>Traditionally the [[Annelida]] have been considered the closest relatives of the Panarthropoda, since both groups have segmented bodies; the combination of these groups was labelled [[Articulata]]. There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as [[nematode]]s, [[priapulid]]s and [[tardigrade]]s, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups. However in the 1990s [[molecular phylogenetics]] analyses that compared sequences of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a [[superphylum]] labelled [[Ecdysozoa]] ("animals that molt"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of these animals' anatomy and development, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with [[mollusc]]s and [[brachiopod]]s.  If the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or has been inherited from a much older ancestor, and has been subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.<ref>{{cite journal

# '''[[Crustacean]]s''' are primarily aquatic (a notable exception being [[woodlouse|woodlice]]) and are characterised by having [[Arthropod leg#Biramous and uniramous|biramous]] appendages. They include [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, [[barnacle]]s, [[crayfish]], [[shrimp]] and many others.

Aside from these major groups, there are also a number of fossil forms, mostly from the Early [[Cambrian]], which are difficult to place, either from lack of obvious affinity to any of the main groups or from clear affinity to several of them. ''[[Marrella]]'' was the first one to be recognized as significantly different from the well-known groups.<ref name="Whittington1971Marrella" />

The [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of the arthropods has been an area of considerable interest and dispute. The validity of many of the arthropod groups suggested by earlier authors is being questioned by recent studies; these include [[Mandibulata]], [[Uniramia]] and [[Atelocerata]]. The most recent studies tend to suggest a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] Crustacea with different hexapod groups nested within it.<ref name="Hassanin"/><ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |title=The position of crustaceans within Arthropoda — Evidence from nine molecular loci and morphology |author=Giribet, G., S.
