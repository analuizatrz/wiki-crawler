==History==

The Mark Messier Leadership Award works quite differently compared to most other trophies in the [[NHL]]. During the season, five players in the NHL will be honored with monthly awards. The NHL will assist in the selection and qualification of potential recipients with the final decision made by Mark Messier. At the end of the regular season, one player is chosen as the Leader of the Year. The "Leader Of The Year" will have their name permanently engraved on the Mark Messier Leadership Award. The award was named after the Mark Messier, a longtime player in the NHL. Messier is, to date, the only person to be the captain of two different teams that won the [[Stanley Cup]].
