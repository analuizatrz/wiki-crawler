'''Dubstep''' is a [[genre]] of [[electronic dance music]] which has its roots in [[London]]'s early 2000s [[UK garage]] scene.  The genre's name was coined by Ammunition Promotions.<ref name="wire279" />   Musically, dubstep is distinguished by its dark mood, sparse rhythms, and emphasis on [[bass (musical term)|bass]]. Dubstep started to spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006, with many [[blog]]s and [[internet forum|forum]]s devoted to the genre appearing on the [[Internet]]. Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' and online publications such as [[Pitchfork Media]].

Interest in dubstep grew further after [[BBC Radio 1]] [[Disk jockey#Radio disk jockeys|DJ]] [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] began championing the genre, devoting a show to it entitled "Dubstep Warz", in January 2006.<ref name="teleg"/><ref name="Time1">{{cite web | author= O'Connell, Sharon | title=  Dubstep | work=  [[Time Out London]] | url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2083/3.html | date= [[4 October]] [[2006]] | |accessmonthday=[[21 June]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref><ref name="Pitch1">{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39704-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= [[16 November]] [[2006]] | |accessmonthday=[[21 June]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref> By October 2006, the genre was being covered in the UK national press, where the [[Daily Telegraph]] wrote of "the latest development in British dance music... yet another sound stemming from London's garage scene, a bass-heavy instrumental form rather confusingly known as Dubstep."<ref name="teleg"/>

{{sample box end}}Dubstep's early roots are in the more experimental releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of [[dub reggae]] into the [[South London]]-based [[UK garage#2-step|2-step]] subgenre. These experiments often ended up on the B-side of a [[white label]] or commercial garage release.<ref name="wire279">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/current/index.php |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |issue=279 |title=The Primer: Dubstep}}</ref><ref name="teleg">{{cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=[[2006-10-14]] |last = de Wilde |first=Gervase |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/10/14/bmdubstep14.xml |title=Put a bit of dub in your step: a new form of dance music from Croydon is ready to conquer the world}}</ref><ref name="plasticman">{{cite web|title= Interview: Plasticman|work= Riddim.ca |url=http://www.riddim.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=49&Itemid=39 |author=Pearsall |date=[[2005-06-18]]}}</ref> Like another, more vocal garage hybrid, [[Grime (music)|grime]], the genre's feel is often dark; tracks frequently use a [[minor key]] and often feature [[dissonant]] harmonies such as the [[diminished chord]]. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of [[sample (music)|samples]], the fact it is a largely [[instrumental music|instrumental]] genre, a propulsive, sparse rhythm,<ref name="cbc">[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/dub_style.html "South London calling" from CBC.ca website] Matthew McKinnon, January 30 2007</ref> and an almost omnipresent [[subbass]].  Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from [[Basic Channel]] to classical music to heavy metal.<ref name = "Pitch5" /><ref name="cbc" /><ref name="RA101" />

===Rhythm===
Dubstep rhythms are usually [[syncopation|syncopated]], and often [[swung note|shuffled]] or incorporating [[tuplet|triplets]]. The tempo is nearly always in the range of 138-142[[beats per minute|bpm]].<ref name="cbc">.</ref>
Dubstep rhythms typically do not follow the [[four-to-the-floor]] pattern common to many other styles of electronic dance music, but instead tend to skip beats and repeat sets of two bars rather than single bars. Often, a track's percussion will follow a pattern which when heard alone will appear to be playing at half the tempo of the track; the double-time feel is instead achieved by other elements, usually the bassline. An excellent example of this tension generated by the conflicting tempi  is [[Skream]]'s ''Rutten'', which features a very sparse rhythm almost entirely composed of [[kick drum]], [[snare drum]], and a sparse [[hi-hat]], with a distinctly [[half time (music)|half time]] implied 69bpm tempo. The track is instead propelled by a constant subbass following a [[four to the floor]] 138bpm pattern.

In an ''Invisible Jukebox'' interview with ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', dubstep artist and label owner [[Kode9]] commented on a DJ Mark One track, observing that listeners "have internalized the double-time rhythm" and the "track is so empty it makes [the listener] nervous, and you almost fill in the double time yourself, physically, to compensate".<ref name="Wire269">''Invisible Jukebox'', [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] no. 269, July 2006</ref>

===Bass drops and rewinds===
Many dubstep tracks incorporate one or more "bass drops," a characteristic inherited from [[drum and bass]].  Typically, the percussion will pause, often reducing the track to silence, and then resume with more intensity, accompanied by a dominant subbass (often passing [[portamento]] through an entire octave, as in the audio example).

Rewinds (also known as "reloads")<ref name="Nice1">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Interview with Joe Nice | date=[[2006-08-15]] | publisher= | url =http://www.getdarker.com/?id=5&fid=7&tid=53 | work =GetDarker | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | language = }}</ref> are another technique used by dubstep [[disc jockey|DJ]]s.  If a song seems to be especially popular, the DJ will 'spin back' the record by hand without lifting the stylus, and play the track in question again. Rewinds are also an important live element in many of dubstep's precursors; the technique originates in dub reggae [[soundsystem]]s, and is also used at UK garage and jungle nights.<ref name="Clark4">{{cite news | first=Martin | last=Clark | coauthors= | title=The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | date=[[2006-07-14]] | publisher= | url =http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/37340-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | work =Pitchfork Media | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | language = }}</ref>

===Structure===
[[Image:Mala_live.jpg|thumb|right|Mala of Digital Mystikz]]
Early dubstep releases inherited a [[song structure (popular music)|structure]] similar to those used in drum and bass and UK garage, typically comprising an [[introduction (music)|intro]], a main section (often incorporating a bass drop), a [[bridge (music)|midsection]], a second main section similar to the first (often with another drop), and an [[outro]]. 

This rather rigid format has evolved in recent times, unlike in [[Grime (music)|grime]], where the focus tends to be on providing a musical framework for [[Microphone Controller|MC]]s to [[rap]] over. As a result, some grime DJs, such as [[Plastician]], have begun playing more dubstep,<ref name="Pitch5">{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/43074-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= [[23 May]] [[2007]] | |accessmonthday=[[14 July]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref> and some grime MCs, such as [[JME (rapper)|JME]] and [[Durrty Goodz]], have released tracks with a dubstep sound or MCed directly over dubstep beats.  Coki and Mala of [[Digital Mystikz]] have experimented with abrupt, 16-bar intros and have produced tracks with dub vocalists,<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?id=20781 |title=Digital Mystikz - Haunted / Anti-War Dub |accessdate=2007-10-26 |work=Boomkat }}</ref> and dubstep artist and label co-owner [[Skull Disco|Sam Shackleton]] has mentioned in interview that his latest, unreleased productions entirely lack the traditional bass drop, and fall outside the traditional dubstep tempo altogether, typically having a tempo around the 100bpm mark.<ref name="wire281">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/current/index.php |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |issue=281 |title=Rave from the grave: Skull Disco}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins of the sound: 1999-2002===
The sound of dubstep originally came out of productions by [[El-B]]<ref name="wire279" />, [[Oris Jay]]<ref name="RA101" />, [[Steve Gurley]]<ref name="wire279" />(who all feature on [[Tempa]]'s ''Roots of Dubstep'' compilation) and [[Zed Bias]]<ref name="Mugan">Mugan, Chris.

Producers including D1, Skream and [[Benga (artist)|Benga]] make regular appearances.<ref name="djmag">.</ref>

Another crucial element in the early development of dubstep was the Big Apple Records record shop in [[Croydon]].<ref name="Time1" /> Key artists such as Hatcha and later Skream worked in the shop (which initially sold garage and drum and bass, but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area),<ref name="wire279" /> while Digital Mystikz were frequent visitors.  El-B, Zed Bias, Horsepower, and a young [[Loefah]] regularly visited the shop as well.<ref name="Time1" /> The shop and its record label have since closed down<ref name="Mugan"/> and reopened under the name Mixing Records.

===Origins of the scene: 2003-2005===
Throughout [[2003]] Rinse FM and through his sets at Forward>>,<ref name="Time1" /> DJ Hatcha pioneered a new direction for dubstep, one that established the scene as a new sound.<ref name="Pitch3" /> Playing sets cut to 10" one-off reggae-style [[dubplate]]s, he drew exclusively from a pool of new South London producers - first [[Benga (artist)|Benga]] and Skream,<ref name="Pitch3" /> then also Digital Mystikz and Loefah - to begin a dark, clipped and minimal new direction in dubstep.<ref name='Pitch6/05'> {{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10330-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep |title=Column: The Month in Grime / Dubstep |accessdate=2007-07-18 |last=Clark |first=Martin |date=2005-06-22 |work=Pitchfork Media }}</ref> Digital Mystikz followed by bringing an expanded palate of sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.<ref name="Pitch2">{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10331-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= [[20 July]] [[2006]] | |accessmonthday=[[4 July]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref>
[[Image:Skream_live.jpg|thumb|right|Dubstep producer Skream, one of the most widely known names in the scene]]

The south London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki) and Loefah soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, [[dub music|dub]] values, and appreciation of [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] bass weight to the dubstep scene.<ref name="Mugan" /> After releasing 12"s on Big Apple, they founded DMZ Records, which has released thirteen 12"s to date.

The evening that queues at DMZ exceeded the capacity of the venue, prompting an immediate move to a larger capacity venue upstairs, has been described as a pivotal point in dubstep's history.<ref name="RA101" /><ref>{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10337-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= [[8 March]] [[2006]] | |accessmonthday=[[10 July]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref>

In 2004, [[Rephlex]] (assisted by Ammunition) put together two compilations that included dubstep tracks, named ''Grime'' and ''Grime 2''.  The first featured Plasticman, Mark One and Slaughter Mob,<ref>http://www.cyclicdefrost.com/review.php?review=568</ref> with Kode 9, Loefah and Digital Mystikz appearing on the second.<ref>http://www.cyclicdefrost.com/review.php?review=724</ref>  These compilations helped to raise awareness of dubstep at a time when the [[Grime (music)|grime]] sound was drawing more attention,<ref name="Mugan" /> and Digital Mystikz and Loefah's presence on the second release contributed to the success of their DMZ club night.<ref>{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10333-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= [[11 September]] [[2005]] | |accessmonthday=[[17 July]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref> Soon afterwards, the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' commented on "a whole new sound", at a time when both genres were becoming popular, stating that "grime" and "dubstep" were two names for the same style, which was also known as "sublow", "8-bar" and "eskibeat".<ref name="IOS">{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2004-02-22]] |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040222/ai_n12752133 |last=Braddock |first=Kevin |title = Partners in Grime}}</ref>  In the summer of 2005, Forward>> brought grime DJs to the fore of the line up.<ref name='Clark5'>{{cite news | first=Clark | last=Martin | coauthors= | title=The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | date=[[2005-06-22]] | publisher= | url =http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10330-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | work =Pitchfork Media | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | language = }}</ref>
