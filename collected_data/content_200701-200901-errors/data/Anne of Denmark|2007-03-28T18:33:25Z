== Life ==
Anne was a daughter of [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway]] and [[Sofie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (d. 1631)|Sophia of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. She was born in 1574 at [[Skanderborg|Skanderborg Castle]], [[Denmark]]. The dates of her birth and death are variously recorded, those above being the ones engraved on her coffin.  In August [[1589]], she was married, by [[proxy]], to James, the young king of [[Scotland]], and their actual wedding ceremony took place in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], on [[November 23]] of that year. Anne was brought to Scotland and crowned queen on [[May 17]], [[1590]], at [[Holyrood Abbey]].  

Although James and Anne were very close at the beginning of their marriage, they gradually drifted apart. Though she had been brought up a [[Lutheran]], she converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] in the mid 1590s. This made her unpopular among the people of [[Presbyterian]] Scotland (and later, of [[Anglican]] England).

Following her husband's accession to the English throne in [[1603]], she was crowned with him on [[July 25]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]. By this time, she was the mother of three living children ([[Henry Frederick Stuart|Henry]], [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles]]), but also suffered several miscarriages and stillbirths, and had another four children who died in infancy. Anne's participation in life at court is well recorded. Their second son succeeded James as King Charles I. Her daughter [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] was the grandmother of [[George I of England|King George I of England]].

Anne of Denmark died at [[Hampton Court Palace]] aged 44 and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].
