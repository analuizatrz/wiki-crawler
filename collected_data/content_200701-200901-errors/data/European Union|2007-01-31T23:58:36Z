The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a [[supranationalism|supranational]] and [[intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] [[political union|union]] of 27  [[democracy|democratic]] [[European Union member states|member states]] in [[Europe]]. The European Union was established under that name in 1992 by the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Many aspects of the Union existed before then through a series of predecessor relationships, dating back to 1951.<ref name="panorama">"[http://europa.eu/abc/panorama/index_en.htm Panorama of the European Union]", Europa. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> 

The European Union is the largest political and economic entity on the European continent, with around 500 million people and an estimated GDP of US$13.4 trillion.  The Union has a [[single market]] consisting of a [[customs union]], a currency called the [[euro]] — adopted by 13 member states, a [[Common Agricultural Policy]], a common trade policy,<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=916768 EU and US Perspectives on China’s Compliance with Transparency], SSRN, by [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=629289 Paolo Farah], Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> and a [[Common Fisheries Policy]].<ref>[http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm Activities of the EU — Internal market], Europa.

==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
[[Image:RobetSchuman.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Robert Schuman]]]]
The EU has evolved from a western European trade body into the supranational and intergovernmental body that it is today. After the [[Second World War]], an impetus grew in western Europe for institutional forms of cooperation between states, driven by the determination to rebuild Europe and eliminate the possibility of another [[World War]]. Eastern Europe, on the other hand, was largely within the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[sphere of influence]], and only in the 1990's did the EU see central and eastern European states as potential members.

In [[1946]] [[Winston Churchill]] called for a "United States of Europe" (though without the inclusion of the UK).<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=65 Winston Churchill], www.winstonchurchill.org .Accessed January 25, 2007</ref>  On [[May 9]] [[1950]], the French foreign minister [[Robert Schuman]] presented a proposal for the joint management of France's and West Germany's coal and steel industries. The proposal, known as the "[[Schuman Declaration]]", envisaged the scheme as "the first concrete step towards a European federation" <ref>[http://europa.eu.int/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm]</ref>.  It is considered to be the beginning of the creation of what is now the European Union, and led to the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] by [[Germany|(West) Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[Benelux]] countries. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed in 1951.<ref>[http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm History of the European Union], Europa. Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> [[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The founding nations signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]

The first full customs union - the ''European Economic Community'' (the Common Market) - was established by the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 and implemented on [[1 January]] [[1958]]. This later changed to the ''European Community'', which is now the "first pillar" of the European Union created by the [[Maastricht treaty]].  

On [[29 October]] [[2004]], EU member state heads of government and state [[signature|signed]] the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]]. This was later ratified by 17 member states. However, in most cases ratification was based on parliamentary action, rather than popular vote, and the process faltered on [[29 May]] [[2005]] when French voters rejected the constitution 55% to 45%. [[French referendum on the European Constitution|The French rejection]] was followed three days later by a [[Dutch referendum on the European Constitution|Dutch]] one, in which 62% of voters refused the constitution as well.

==Geography==
[[Image:OffeneGrenzeNiederndorf-Oberaudorf.jpg|thumb|200px|A typical "Schengen border" near [[Kufstein]]: The traffic island marks the spot where a control post once stood, but was removed in 2000.]]
The territory of the European Union is formed by the territory of its member states, and expands with the accession of new members: it is not in itself a geographical unit. It covers an area of 4,336,790 [[square kilometre]]s (1,674,444&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]). Extending northeast to Finland, northwest to Ireland and southeast from Cyprus to Portugal in the southwest it represents the [[List of countries by area|seventh largest territory in the world by area]].

The EU is not coterminous with Europe: significant parts of the continent (e.g. [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], European [[Russia]]) have chosen to remain outside of the EU.

The member states of the EU have [[countries bordering the European Union|land borders]] with 21 other nations and several overseas territories and dependencies remain nationally associated with particular countries, for example the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Azores]], [[French Guiana]] and [[Madeira]].

The climate is predominantly influenced by temperate zones and are categorized by maritime areas in coastal regions and temperate/continental climate in eastern member states. The constant Gulf Stream stabilises the temperate seasons. Temperatures range from northern Scandinavian averages of -13°C in winter to +15°C, to Mediterranean Malta (average +12°C in winter to +25°C in summer).

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}
Political issues currently facing the EU cover its membership, structure, procedures and policies. They include the status and future of the [[European Constitution|constitutional treaty]]; [[enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] to the south and east; problems of financial probity and [[democratic deficit|democratic accountability]]; relative economic viability; revision of the rules of the [[Stability and Growth Pact]]; and the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].

The [[Financial Perspective]] for 2007–2013 was defined in 2005 when EU members agreed to fix the common budget to 1.045% of the [[European]] [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/misc/87677.pdf Financial Perspective 2007–2013]}}, Council of the European Union, [[17 December]] [[2005]]. Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] agreed to review the [[UK rebate|British rebate]], negotiated by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1984. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] declared this increase in the budget will permit Europe to "finance common policies" such as the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] or the [[Sixth Framework Programme|Research and Technological Development Policy]]. France's demand to lower the [[value added tax|VAT]] in catering was refused.<ref>"[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/30/business/vat.php Poles block EU deal on lower VAT]", ''[[The Times|Times Online]]'', [[31 January]] [[2006]].

==Three pillars==
{{main|Three pillars of the European Union}}
The 'pillar' structure created by the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] moved the older policies and activities into the 'first pillar, labeled the 'European Communities'. The more controversial new policy areas - foreign policy, security and defence, asylum and immigration, and judicial co-operation - were moved into two new 'pillars'.
===European Economic Community===
{{main|European Community}}
The most prominent policy goal of the European Union is the development and maintenance of an effective [[single market]]. Significant efforts have been made to create harmonised standards designed to bring economic benefits through creating larger, more efficient markets. Since the Treaty of Rome, policies have implemented [[free trade]] of goods and services among member states, and continue to do so. This policy goal was further extended to three of the four [[EFTA]] states by the [[European Economic Area]], EEA. Common [[EU competition law]] restricts anti-competitive activities of companies (through antitrust law and merger control) and member states (through the State Aids regime). The EU promotes free movement of [[financial capital|capital]] between member states (and other EEA states). The members have a common system of indirect [[taxation]], the [[VAT]], as well as common customs duties and excises on various products. They have a common external [[customs (tax)|customs]] tariff, and a common position in international trade negotiations.  Other single-market policies include energy market policy and the [[European Common Aviation Area]]. The introduction of the [[Euro]], not yet adopted by all member states, created the [[Eurozone]], a single currency area including 13 member states with more than 300 million people.
[[Image:Euro_banknotes.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[Euro]] is adopted by 13 countries]]
A second major goal has been the free movement of persons. Citizens of member states can live and work anywhere within the EU with their spouses and children, provided they can support themselves. This has been extended to the other EEA states and Switzerland.

In terms of funding, the two major policies are the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (with the [[Common Fisheries Policy]]) and the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|structural and cohesion funds]], which improve infrastructure and assist disadvantaged regions. Together they are known as the '''cohesion policies.''' The EU also has funds for emergency financial aid, for instance after natural disasters. The funding extends to programmes in candidate countries and other [[Eastern Europe]]an countries, as well as aid to many developing countries, through programmes such as [[Phare]], [[TACIS]], [[Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession|ISPA]]. The EU also funds research and technological development, through four-year [[Seventh Framework Programme|Framework Programmes]] for Research and Technological Development.

In a more political sense, the EU attempts to create - with much controversy - a sense of European citizenship and European political life. That includes freedom for citizens of the EU to vote and to stand as candidates in local government and [[European Parliament]] elections in any member state.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope/nav/en/citizens/citizenship/citizenship/index.html European citizenship], Europa. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> The [[European Parliament]] is now attempting to create pan-European political parties, and almost all members have joined at least a federation of national political parties.

===Common Foreign & Security Policy===
{{Main|Common Foreign and Security Policy|European Security and Defence Policy}}
[[Image:Condisolana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Javier Solana]], the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative for the CFSP]] (l.) and [[Condoleezza Rice]]]]
Defence and security are traditionally matters of national sovereignty. 
EU policies in this area were established as the second of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] in the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The ''Common Foreign and Security Policy'' or CFSP were further defined and broadened in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of 1997. It superseded the [[European Political Cooperation]]. The CFSP acknowledges [[NATO]] being responsible for territorial defence of Europe and "peace-making". In 1999 the [[European Council]] took over responsibilities for the implementation  of peace-keeping missions ([[EUFOR]] in Bosnia Herzegovina, Congo) and policing of treaties.  The supervision is coordinated by the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], [[Javier Solana]].

The [[European Security and Defence Policy]] is an element of the  CFSP and stipulated the framing for policies that could deal with humanitarian and rescue tasks, and tasks of combat forces. It includes the creation of a 60,000-member [[European Rapid Reaction Force]] for [[peacekeeping]] purposes, an EU [[military]] staff, a [[European Defence Agency]] and an EU [[satellite]] centre (for intelligence purposes).

===Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters===
{{Main|Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters}}
The third of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] of the European Union is focusing on cooperation in criminal matters, including sharing of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] (through [[Europol]] and the [[Schengen Information System]]), agreement on common definition of [[crime|criminal offences]] and expedited [[extradition]] procedures.
It is the EU instrument of [[law]] enforcement and combating [[racism]]. 

It was created as the ''Justice and Home Affairs'' pillar in the [[Treaty of Maastricht]]; subsequently the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] transferred the areas of illegal [[immigration]], [[visa (document)|visas]], [[refugee|asylum]], and judicial co-operation to the integrated first ([[European Community]]) pillar.   The term ''Justice and Home Affairs'' now covers these integrated fields as well as the intergovernmental third pillar.

==Institutions and bodies==
[[Image:José Manuel Durão Barroso.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The [[President of the European Commission]], [[José Manuel Barroso]]]]

From [[1958]], the Commissions of the EEC and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) had their seats in Brussels.

The member states reached agreement on a single permanent seat for the Community institutions, European officials were distributed between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, leading, in particular, to a considerable increase in overheads. Brussels was chosen as the seat of the Single Commission and the Council of Ministers. In practical terms, this meant that most European officials were employed there. 

Luxembourg sought compensation for the loss of the High Authority and the Special Council of Ministers of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), both of which were relocated to Brussels. However, Luxembourg became the seat for the new European Investment Bank (EIB) and was given the assurance that certain meetings of the Council of Ministers would be held there, in April, June and September. 
[[Image:Angela Merkel Joh.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]] of the [[European Council]] is currently held by Germany ([[Angela Merkel]], Chancellor)]]
The Court of Justice, the Central Statistical Office, the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, the Advisory Committee and the financial services of the ECSC and the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly also remained in Luxembourg. Meanwhile, France refused to renounce its claim for Strasbourg as seat of the Parliamentary Assembly. An expensive and inconvenient compromise was reached whereby Parliament’s Members met in plenary session in Strasbourg but meetings of parliamentary committees were held in Brussels. Certain plenary meetings were also held in Luxembourg, which was also the seat of the Secretariat of the European Parliament. 

The EU has no official capital and its institutions are divided between several cities:
{{-}}
[[Image:Eurotower in Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Frankfurt]] is the seat of the [[European Central Bank]]]]
* [[Brussels]] — seat of the [[European Commission]] (staff of about 23,000) and the [[Council of Ministers]]. It is also the venue of the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] (785 members) committee meetings and mini-sessions and (since 2004) the host city for all [[European Council]] summits.
* [[Strasbourg]] — seat of the [[European Parliament]] and venue of its twelve week-long plenary sessions each year. Strasbourg is also the seat of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which are not bodies of the EU.
* [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] — seat of the [[European Court of Justice]] (incorporating the [[Court of First Instance]]), the [[European Court of Auditors]], the [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]] and the [[European Investment Bank]].
* [[Frankfurt]] — seat of the [[European Central Bank]] (Composing the [[European System of Central Banks]])
* The [[European Council]], which is a regular meeting of the 27 head of member states and the [[European Commission president]] is sometimes also listed as an institution, although since it lacks its own staff, budget and the legal powers held by the above 5 institutions, it is better described as a "quasi-institution".
[[Image:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]]]]
There are also two [[Advisory bodies to the European Union|advisory committees]] to the institutions; [[Committee of the Regions]], advising on regional issues and the [[Economic and Social Committee]], advising on economic and social policy (principally relations between workers and employers).

A number (currently 32) of more specialised [[agencies of the European Union]], usually set up by [[secondary legislation]], which exist to implement particular policies. Examples are the [[EUROPOL]] (the European Police Office), the [[European Environment Agency]], the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] or the [[Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market]], the [[Political and Security Committee]], established in the context of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], monitoring and advising on international issues of global security.

==Law==
{{main|European Union law}}
[[Image:ECoJ.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[European Court of Justice]]]]
The EU constitutional structures include [[supranationalism|supranational]], [[intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]], and [[confederation|confederal]] elements. The EU members have transferred considerable [[sovereignty]] to it, more than that of any other non-sovereign [[international organisation#List of Regional Organisations|regional organisation]]. However, in legal terms the member states remain the ''masters of the Treaties'', which means the Union does not have the power to transfer additional powers from states onto itself without their agreement through further international treaties. Because of this unique structure classify the European Union can be considered as a ''[[sui generis]]'' entity.

European Union law is the first and only example of a [[supranationalism|supranational]] legal framework. According to the [[European Court of Justice]], in one of its earliest cases, it constitutes "a new legal order of international law".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML Van Gend en Loos v. Nederlanse Administratie Der Belastingen], EU-LEX, Accessed January 25, 2007
</ref> Sovereign [[nation states]], by becoming EU members, pool their authority for the mutual social and economic benefit of their peoples. The principle of [[subsidiarity]] means that laws are passed at the regional level where they are more effective when member states take action by themselves.

The two main treaties which form the basis of EU law are the Treaty of the European Community, or the [[Treaty of Rome]] from 1957, and the Treaty of the European Union, or the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The Treaty of Rome is the so called 'first pillar' of the EU. The "European Community" refers to the competence of the EU to act in the social and economic arena. The Maastricht treaty formed the new European Union, and added two further "pillars". These are a common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. In both these fields a consensus among member states is needed to act. 

EU law covers a range as broad as many member states themselves<ref>see Article 3 TEU for a list</ref>. Where a conflict arises between EU law and the law of a member state, EU law takes precedence, so that the law of a member state must be disapplied.<ref>in general, see C 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585, 593; in the U.K. see, [[Factortame case|''Factortame Ltd. v Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'']]; in Germany see ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 Oct. 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265); in Italy see ''Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; in France see, Raoul George Nicolo [1990] 1 CMLR 173</ref> Both the provisions of the Treaties, and EU regulations are said to have "[[direct effect]]" horizontally. This means private citizens can rely on the rights granted to them (and the duties created for them) against one another. For instance, an air hostess may sue her aeroplane company employer for sexual discrimination.<ref>under Art. 141 TEC, C-43/75 ''Defrenne v. Sabena'' [1976] ECR 455</ref> The other main legal instrument of the EU, "directives", have direct effect, but only "vertically". Private citizens may not sue one another on the basis of an EU directive, since these are meant to be addressed to the member state. Directives allow some choice for member states in the way they translate a directive into an [[act of Parliament]], or [[statutory instrument]]. Once this has happened citizens may rely on the law that has been implemented. They may only sue the government "vertically" for failing to implement a directive correctly. An example of a directive is the [[Product liability]] Directive,<ref>85/374/EEC</ref> which makes companies liable for dangerous and defective products that harm consumers.

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of the European Union}}
[[Image:G8 2006 leaders 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|EU leaders regularly participate at the [[G8]] summits - [[Matti Vanhanen|Vanhanen]] & [[José Manuel Durão Barroso|Barroso]]]]
Supporters of the European Union argue that the growth of the EU is a force for [[peace]] and [[democracy]]. They point out that the wars which were a periodic feature of the history of Western Europe have ceased since the formation of the European Economic Community (which later became the EU) in the [[1950s]].

Others contend that peace in Europe since [[World War II]] is the product of other causes, such as the moderating influence of the [[U.S.]] and [[NATO]], the need for a unified response to the threat from the [[Soviet Union]], the need for reconstruction after World War II, and a collective temporary tiring of waging war, and that the dictatorships cited came to an end for entirely different reasons.

In more recent times, the European Union has been extending its influence to the east. It has accepted several new members that were previously behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. It is hoped that in a similar fashion to the entry of Spain, Portugal and Greece in the [[1980s]], membership for these states will help cement economic and political stability.
[[Image:Peter Mandelson.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Peter Mandelson]], [[European Commissioner for Trade|Commissioner of Trade]], represented the EU in the latest [[Doha round|WTO negociation round]]]]
The [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] states of [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] are members of the [[European Economic Area]] which allows them to participate in most aspects of the EU single market without acceding to the EU. [[Switzerland]], the fourth EFTA state, rejected EEA membership in a referendum; however, it has established close ties to the EU by means of various bilateral treaties.

The European Union also represents its 27 member states in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) through its Trade Commissioner [[Peter Mandelson]]. The latest [[Doha round|WTO negociation round]] has currently stalled, in part due to the EU's refusal to curtail the agricultural subsidies it distributes through the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] without similar action by other developped countries.

The European Union's status as a superpower is still widely discussed. Lately, such a status is starting to be acknowledged by bodies as diverse as the United States' [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html European Union], The World Factbook. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>  <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/ CIA World Factbook — What's new], The World Factbook.

==Enlargement==
{{main|Enlargement of the European Union|European Union membership criteria}} 
Since starting with the six states of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in [[1952]], there are now 27 [[European Union member states|member states]] in the EU. There have been six enlargements, with the largest occurring on [[May 1]], [[2004]], when 10 states joined, and the most recent on [[January 1]], [[2007]], when [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] joined. In order to join the European Union, a state needs to fulfill the economic and political conditions generally known as the [[Copenhagen criteria]] (after the [[Copenhagen]] summit in June [[1993]]). That basically requires a secular, democratic government, rule of law and corresponding freedoms and institutions. According to the [[Treaty on European Union|EU Treaty]], each current member state and also the [[European Parliament]] have to agree to any enlargement.

[[Image:EUenl.gif|thumb|right|200px|EU enlargement 1952–2007]]
'''[[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey is an official candidate]]''' to join the European Union; Turkish European ambitions date back to 1963 Ankara Agreements. Turkey started preliminary negotiations on [[3 October]] [[2005]]. However, analysts believe [[2015]] is the earliest date the country can join the union because of the large number of economic and social reforms it has to complete, and because the [[2007]]–[[2013|13]] budget takes no account of the considerable costs Turkey's accession will involve.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4107919.stm Q&A: Turkey's EU entry talks]", [[BBC News Online]], [[4 October]] [[2005]]. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> The [[Cyprus dispute]] and Turkey's geographic setting are open questions, as only 3% of its territory lies on Europe. However, the [[Copenhagen criteria#Geographic criteria|Copenhagen criteria]] do not impose strict geographic conditions. There are also worries about [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s view about the "European Identity", as in a cultural, continent-based Christianity, historically opposed by the Ottoman Empire, especially since he was designated as Pope.<ref>Magister, Sandro"[http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=19629&eng=y Europe is Christian, but Turkey's Crescent Moon Shines in its Skies]", Chiesa Espress, [[15 October]] [[2004]].</ref>However, he expressed greater support for Turkey's admission following his late-November visit to the country in 2006. Lately, there have been reports on growing differences between the EU and the Turkish government,<ref>"[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8142969 Pulling the rug out from under?]", [[The Economist]], Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> including a discontent on the side of the Turkish because they feel as though they are capitulating to the demands of the EU while receiving nothing for their efforts. 

'''[[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia is an official candidate]]''' country to join and started accession negotiations in October 2005. In June 2006, the EU officials projected that the accession of Croatia would likely happen in 2010. The closure of negotiations for all chapters of the ''[[acquis communautaire]]'' is expected in 2008 or 2009, while signing the Accession treaty would happen in the year after.

'''[[Accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union|The Republic of Macedonia]]''' is the latest country to be given official candidate status, [[as of 2005|as of December 2005]].<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/comm/enlargement/report_2005/pdf/package_v/com_562_final_en_opinion_fyrom.pdf  EU application assessment of Macedonia], Europa-Enlargement. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> There has been controversy however with [[Greece]] over use of [[Macedonia (terminology)|the name Macedonia ]] for the country and its relations with Bulgaria. [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]] are officially recognised as potential candidates.

==Economy==
[[Image:655px-European_Union_GDP_per_capita.png|thumb|right|180px|GDP (PPP) per capita 2006]]
{{main|Economy of the European Union}}
Considered as a single entity, the European Union has the largest economy in the world. With a [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|GDP]] of 13,400,000 million USD (2005) using [[Purchasing power parity]] (PPP). The EU economy has grown at around 2% per annum so far this century. In 2006, it is estimated 3.5 million jobs were created in the Eurozone. [[Germany]], the largest economy in the EU, grew 2.5% in 2006 and is expected to grow at around 2.5% in 2007. The EU's rate of growth is expected to increase — growth for 2007 is expected to be at 2.7% — especially as new member states are poorer than the EU average, and have the capacity to grow at a higher rate.

EU member states have agreed a programme called the [[Lisbon Strategy]] which aims at making "the EU the world's most dynamic and competitive economy" by 2010.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/et_2010_en.html The Education and Training Contribution to the Lisbon Strategy], European Commission. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> The strategy documents do not indicate how relative success or failure will be measured.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of the European Union}}
The population of the European Union is the population of its [[Member states of the European Union|member states]], and expands with each accession. It also changes through the four [[demography|demographic]] factors of births, deaths, immigration (to the EU) and emigration (from the EU). Averages such as [[life expectancy]] and [[fertility rate]] shift with each new accession. Current  total EU population is approximately 493 million inhabitants [[as of 2007|as of January 2007]] making it the [[List of countries by population|third largest geopolitical entity by population]]. Expected short-term accessions (Croatia) will not substantially increase EU population, expected to remain at around 500 million. Growth in the short term is expected to come from net migration, since deaths will probably outnumber births from around [[2010]]. After [[2025]], this negative [[natural increase]] will probably exceed net immigration, and (discounting new accessions) population is expected to decline gradually.<ref name="EU25populationprojection">{{PDFlink|[http://intranet.icea.es/pensiones/documentacion/Proy_demog_2004_2050.pdf EU25 population projection]}}, Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

===Largest cities===
{{main|Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits}}
The European Union is home to 16 cities with populations over one million inhabitants, counted in its city proper. Cities of notable size comprising large urban areas are [[Barcelona]], [[Milan]],  [[Rotterdam]] and [[Athens]]. Densely populated regions without historic city cores but encompassing large metropolitan areas are [[Rhine-Ruhr]], [[Randstad]], [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Area]] and the [[Upper Silesian Industry Area]].<ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996,45323734&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&screen=welcomeref&open=/&product=EU_MASTER_urban_audit&depth=2 Indicators for larger urban zones 1999 - 2003], Eurostat.

===Religion===
The EU has significant religious diversity, mirroring its diverse history and culture. A nominal majority of the population professes [[Christianity]], predominantly [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Despite this, not all EU nations have Christian majorities (in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]], for example, a majority has no religious affiliation).

The recent influx of immigrants to the affluent EU nations has brought in various religions of their native homelands, including [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Baha'i faith|the Baha'i faith]] and [[Sikhism]]. [[Judaism]] has had a long history in Europe and has coexisted with the native populations for centuries, despite centuries of discrimination against Jewish people and several attendant periods of persecution or genocide by European rulers. As the Christian churches have historically wielded much power in Europe, reaction to this has allowed [[secularism]] to plant deep roots on European soil which has contributed to the rise in [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]].

==Education and science==
{{main|Education in the European Union}}
[[Image:GalileoPS.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Galileo positioning system]] has been initiated by the EU and [[European Space Agency|ESA]]]]
The [[European Commission]] initiated the [[ERASMUS programme]] for [[higher education]].
It was established in 1987 and forms a major part of the EU [[Socrates programme|Socrates II programme]]. Its name is an abbreviation of "European Region Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students" and has been inspired by the life of [[Desiderius Erasmus]]. It was incorporated into the [[Socrates programme]] when that programme was established in 1995. The Socrates programme ended in 1999 and was replaced with the Socrates II programme in 2000.

The aim of ERASMUS is to encourage and support [[academic mobility]] of [[higher education]] students and teachers within the European Union, the [[European Economic Area]] countries of [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] as well as the candidate country [[Turkey]]. 2,199 [[higher education]] institutions are participating in ERASMUS across the 31 countries involved in the [[Socrates programme]]. 1.4 million students have already taken part.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Table 8: Actual Number of ERASMUS Students by Country of Home institution 1987/88-2004/05 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/socrates/erasmus/statisti/table8.pdf}} {{PDFlink}} Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

Member states of the EU are, along with other European nations and several international NGOs, signatories to  the [[Bologna process]].  This is an attempt to create a [[European higher education area]], by making [[academic degree]] standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout [[Europe]]. It is named after the place it was proposed, the [[University of Bologna]] with the signing, in [[1999]], of the [[Bologna declaration]] by ministers of education from 29 European countries in the Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Governmental meetings have been held in [[Prague]] ([[2001]]), [[Berlin]] ([[2003]]) and [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] ([[2005]]); the next meeting will take place in [[London]] in Spring 2007.

The [[Galileo positioning system]] (or simply 'Galileo'), is a proposed [[Global Navigation Satellite System]], to be built by the European Union and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), a non-EU organisation.
The current project plan has the system as operational by 2010. Several other nations are joining the
project co financing the development such as China, Israel, India, Marocco or South Korea.

==Cultural policies==
{{main|Cultural policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:Sibiuphoto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two cities are the [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2007 ([[Sibiu]])]]
The member states have been traditionally reluctant to lose control of cultural policy, given the central role of culture in [[national identity]]. Cultural cooperation  ''between'' member states has become a community competency since its inclusion in [[1992]] in the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Actions taken in the cultural area by the European Union include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme, the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme, the [[European Cultural Month]] event, the [[Media Plus]] programme, experimental actions and the awarding of various grants.

[[Image:Luxembourg0080.JPG|thumb|left|200px| The cities are designated by the EU for a period of one year ([[Luxembourg]])]]

The European Union gave grants to 233 cultural projects in 2004 and launched a webportal dedicated to Europe and Culture, responding to the [[European Council]]'s expressed desire to see the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means."

===Sports===
{{main|Sport policies of the European Union}}
The European Union launched an anti-doping convention. Still it plays a minor and mostly indirect policy role in sport, because (a) sport is normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union and (b) sport is in general organized  internally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally. The European Union does not have specific sport policies. The role of the EU could increase, if (for example) the [[European Constitution]] were to be ratified.

==Languages==
{{main|Languages of the European Union}}
The majority of the official languages  belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]]. Three dominant subfamilies can be separated to Germanic, Italic, and Slavic languages
(strictly used in linguistic terms). Germanic languages are widely spoken in central and northern EU including Danish, Dutch, English, German, and Swedish. Italic or Romance languages are spoken in western and southern EU regions and include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish. They are mainly influenced by Latin vocabulary and grammar. The Slavic languages are to be found in the eastern regions  
of the EU and include Bulgarian (written in [[Cyrillic]]) ,Czech, Polish, Slovak, and Slovene. The Baltic languages Latvian and Lithuanian as well as the Greek language are of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin. The Finno-Ugric language family include Estonian, Finnish, and 
Hungarian while Maltese is the only Semitic language in the EU, but all using the Latin alphabet.

Immigration to the member states led to diversely spreaded ethnic communities. Mostly to be found in urban areas and major cities, first and second generation of immigrants preserve their native tongue. The majority are descendants from the Indian subcontinent, the former Soviet Union or of Arabic and Turkish origin. Second or third languages taught in school are in the majority of cases English, German, French and Spanish.

==Identity and values==
The various cultural traditions of the EU member states are influenced by multiple elements such as language, religious heritage, geopolitical location, neighbor states, economic status, climate, and ethnicity.
The identification towards these traditions are strongly bounded on local, regional, and foremost national level and to some extent global level. Shared experiences and collective memories are influenced by Greek democracy, mythology and drama, Roman law, judeo-christian heritage, Latin script, middle age, humanism, reformation, Age of discovery, colonialism, enlightenment, modernism, and globalisation. The degrees and perspectives on these phenomenas are differing, depending on various factors. Ongoing rivalries and warfare over centuries in all regions led to contrary interpretations on historic incidents and remain so today.

Attitudes and values are also depending on status, level of education or ancestry which are not necessarily nationally bounded. Experiences like the first and second world war, political ideologies, the cold war and western pop culture have shaped the 20th century of EU countries and are also interpreted from different angles. Current and future similarities and attitudes are dominated by the global interdependencies of the EU countries. 

Shared interests of the member states are mainly of economical, political, social and security nature. They are driven by global competition, partnership/ rivalry towards USA and Russia, emerging China, situation in Middle East, environmental issues, and energy safety. Shared activities and lifestyles among the EU peoples are western literature, TV, movie and music, Internet, lowcost-travel, student exchange, international cuisine (in major cities), shopping and global consumer products, and spectator sports such as soccer and Formula One.

==Infrastructure and energy==
[[Image:DanishWindTurbines.jpg|thumb|right|290px|The  EU is one of the leading regions in [[Research and development|R & D]] of [[renewable energy]] (Offshore wind farm near [[Copenhagen]])]]
The EU has a policy to improve cross-border infrastructure, see [[Trans-European Networks]].

The European Union has legislated in the area of energy policy for many years, and evolved out of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] on October 27, [[2005]] in [[London]].

The EU is currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], making it the world's leading importer of these fuels.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/ 'Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe], www.msnbc.msn.com . Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>
