{{Nihongo|'''''Fist of the North Star'''''|北斗の拳|Hokuto no Ken|lit. "Fist of the [[Big Dipper]]"}} is a [[manga]] series that was originally serialized from [[1983]] to [[1988]] in the [[Japan]]ese ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'', created by [[Tetsuo Hara]] and [[Buronson]]. The manga spans 245 chapters that were originally reprinted in 27 collected volumes ([[tankōbon]]) under the ''Jump Comics'' imprint and later reprint editions.

Set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post apocalyptic]] world where the Earth is barren and the strong survive by preying on the weak, the series follows the journey of [[Kenshiro]], the successor of [[Hokuto Shinken]] (北斗神拳, "Big DipperDivine Fist")<ref name=hokutoshinken>While the name Hokuto Shinken literally means ''Big Dipper God Fist'', the standard translation for the fighting style is the same as its English title, Fist of the North Star. It is also referred as the ''Sacred Martial Arts of the Great Bear'' in Viz Media edition and as ''God Fist of the North Star'' in the Gutsoon! edition.</ref>, a secret martial arts style that allows its practitioner to destroy an opponent's body from within by striking into vital [[pressure point]]s, often resulting in a violent and gruesome death (as the series was notorious for). Kenshiro uses his skills to protect the weak and innocent against the numerous villains that threaten their survival.

''Fist of the North Star'' is often considered by many to be a precursor to various [[martial arts]]-themed manga series. Like many popular manga series, it has been adapted into several [[anime]] versions, as well merchandise such as action figures and [[video games]]. As of 2007, it is the seventh best-selling manga of all time that was serialized in the ''Weekly Shonen Jump'' in Japan.[http://comipress.com/article/2007/05/06/1923] In a poll conducted by [[TV Asahi]] in 2005, the ''Fist of the North Star'' anime series ranked 25 in a list of Top 100 Anime series. [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-23/tv-asahi-top-100-anime] In a second poll in 2006, it ranked No. 89.[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-10-13/japan's-favorite-tv-anime] In a celebrity version of the poll, it ranked No. 15.

The title ''Fist of the North Star'' is somewhat of a [[mistranslation]] of the Japanese original, ''Hokuto no Ken'', as ''Hokuto'' refers not to the [[Polaris|North Star]] [[Polaris]], but to the [[Big Dipper]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], which is known in Japan as Hokuto Shichisei (北斗七星, ''Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper''). In Japan, the actual North Star is known as Hokkyokusei (北極星, ''North Pole Star'') or Tenteisei (天帝星, ''Imperial Star''). Nevertheless, ''Fist of the North Star'' is the official English title of the series, even in Japan, and the term ''Hokuto'' is usually translated as "North Star" in the official localizations of the series.

==Publication history==
===Pilot version===
The original [[one shot]] version of ''Hokuto no Ken'', published in the April [[1983]] edition of ''Fresh Jump'', was set in a contemporary setting and told the story of a teenager by the name of {{nihongo|Kasumi Kenshirō|霞 拳四郎}}, the successor of the "''[[Hokuto Shinken]]''", a deadly [[martial arts]] style which kills or cripples opponents internally by striking [[pressure point]]s. Kenshiro's main adversaries in this incarnation of the story were a rival martial arts school known as the {{nihongo|Taizanji Kenpo|泰山寺拳法|Taishan Temple Martial Arts}}, which secretly controlled the [[Japanese government]] and were responsible for the death of Kenshiro's girlfriend, Yuki, who was a witness in one of the organization's crime. 

''Hokuto no Ken'' was the most popular title in that issue according to the reader [[survey]] and Tetsuo Hara was commissioned to do a sequel. The second one-shot, simply titled ''Hokuto no Ken II'',  was published in the June 1983 edition of ''Fresh Jump''. Both pilots were reprinted in the second [[tankōbon]] of Tetsuo Hara's short lived [[motorcross]] manga series, ''Tetsuo no Don Quixote''

===Serialization===
[[Image:Shonen Jump 092683.jpg|thumb|left|''Weekly Shonen Jump'', Issue #41 from 1983.]]
When ''Hokuto no Ken'' was picked up to become a weekly series, manga writer {{nihongo|Yoshiyuki Okamura|岡村善行|Okamura Yoshiyuki}} (under the pen name of {{nihongo|[[Buronson]]|武論尊}}) was assigned by the editors of ''Shonen Jump'' to work with Hara as a writer for the series. The storyline was completely revamped, with contemporary setting being discarded in favor of a ''[[Mad Max]]''-like post apocalypse world. Taizanji Kenpo are no longer the main antagonists and Kenshiro, originally a young teenager, was now an adult with seven scars on his chest.

The first serialized chapter, "A Cry from the Heart", serves to establish the basic premise and setting of the manga, which shows how Kenshiro meets his two sidekicks, Bat, a young thief, and Lin, an orphaned girl whom Kenshiro heals (although she does not become a permanent part of the cast until a few chapters later). The manga's first major story arc, which spans the subsequent nine chapters, revolves around a mysterious gang that terrorizes innocent villagers, which is led by a man simply known as "King". After defeating one of King's top men, the gang declares an all-out war against Kenshiro. Eventually Kenshiro infiltrates King's stronghold, the city of Southern Cross, and learns that King is none other than his former friend Shin of the ''Nanto Seiken'' (南斗聖拳, ''Sacred Fist of the South Dipper'') fighting style, who was responsible for the seven scars on Ken's chest and the kidnapping of his [[fiancee]] Yuria. Kenshiro defeats Shin in combat, only to learn that Yuria has committed suicide while in Shin's captivity.

The focus then shifts into Kenshiro fighting against one-off villains such as the GOLAN commandos, Jackal and his bike gang, and the Fang Clan (牙一族, ''Kiba Ichizoku''). Eventually we learn of the existence of Kenshiro's three adoptive brothers, who were also trained in Hokuto Shinken. A recurring [[antagonist]] is introduced in the form of [[Raoh]], the eldest of the four Hokuto brothers, a conqueror who goes by the name of ''Ken'Õ'' (拳王, ''King of the Fist''). The other two brothers introduced were Toki, a pacifist who uses his Hokuto Shinken knowledge primarily to heal, and Jagi, a petty thug who was quickly killed off and forgotten shortly after he was introduced. A [[subplot]] is also introduced revolving around the ''Nanto Roku Seiken'' («n¤æ¤»¸t®±, ''Six Sacred Fists of the South Dipper''), the six grand masters of the main ''Nanto Seiken'' branches (which includes the already deceased Shin). Following the deaths of five of the Nanto Roku Seiken and Toki, the Last Nanto General is introduced to the story. The battle between Kenshiro and Raoh becomes a race to see who claims the Last Nanto General, who is revealed to be Yuria, having survived in secrecy after her earlier suicide attempt. The battle reaches its conclusion in Chapter 136.

''Hokuto no Ken'' was originally intended to have a three-year run, but due to its popularity, the editors of ''Shonen Jump'' forced Hara and Buronson to renew their contract for two additional years. According Buronson, he did not planned the manga ahead of Raoh's demise and wrote much of the later storyline as it went along during serialization (Buronson also admitted that he does not remember much of what he wrote for ''Hokuto no Ken'' after Raoh's demise). The narrative jumps an unspecified amount of years in Chapter 137, where Bat and Lin, Kenshiro's former sidekicks, are now young adults and leader of the rebel Hokuto Army. The first story arc following the time jump, the Imperial Capital arc (Chapters 137-159), deals with the Hokuto Army's battle against the Imperial Capital's regime. Kenshiro returns to aid his former sidekicks in their battle and fights against the ''Gento Kōken'' (元斗皇拳, ''The Imperial Fist of the Original Dipper'') masters, who are being ordered by the governor-general Jakǒ to fight against Kenshiro and the Hokuto Army. Eventually it is revealed that Jakǒ is holding the Heavenly Empress hostage. The empress is revealed to be Lin's twin sister, Lui, who were separated at birth.

The end of the Imperial Capital arc eventually leads to the Land of Asura arc (Chapters 160-210), which revolves around Kenshiro's mission to save Lin, who's been taken to the foreign land and is held captive by the Demons of Asura. The Land of Asura (修羅の国, ''Shura no Kuni'') is revealed to be the birthplace of Kenshiro, Raoh and Toki, as well as the Hokuto Shinken style itself. Another Hokuto style is also revealed in the form of ''Hokuto Ryǔken'' (北斗琉拳, ''[[Lapis]] Fist of the Northern Dipper''), whose primary successors are none other than Kenshiro's and Raoh's respective lost brothers, Hyou and Kaioh, the new antagonists.

The story arcs (chapters 211-236) following the Asura arc centers around Kenshiro's tutelage of Raoh's orphaned son, Ryu, as they help to liberate Ryu's home village, dissolve a potentional civil war and expose a false deity. The final chapters (237-245) revolves around a love triangle between Kenshiro, Bat and Lin, as Bolge, a villain from Kenshiro's past, returns to get his revenge

===Later works===
After the manga ended its run, Tetsuo Hara and Buronson wrote a novel based on the manga titled {{nihongo|''Cursed City''|呪縛の街|Jubaku no Machi}}, published by Jump Books in Japan in [[1996]]. It was adapted into a three-part [[OVA]] series titled {{nihongo|''New Fist of the North Star''|新・北斗の拳|Shin Hokuto no Ken}} in [[2003]]. The story is set a few years after the conclusion of the manga, but only features Kenshiro as a returning character (however Ryu and Toki make a short cameo appearance ).

In [[2001]], Tetsuo Hara and Buronson began working on a ''Fist of the North Star'' prequel titled {{nihongo|''[[Fist of the Blue Sky]]''|蒼天の拳|Souten no Ken}}, which is currently being serialized in  ''Weekly Comics Bunch''. Set during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in [[1935]], the story stars [[Hokuto Shinken]] predecessor and Kenshiro's namesake, Kenshiro Kasumi.

[[2006]] saw the publication of several manga side-stories based on ''Fist of the North Star'', which were released in conjunction with the release of the movie {{nihongo|''Legend of Raoh: Chapter of Martyred Love''|ラオウ伝 殉愛の書|Rao Den Jun'ai no Sho}}. Each focused on a major character from the series.  These are as followed.

* {{nihongo|''Raoh's Side-Story: The Conqueror of the Heavens''|ラオウ外伝 天の覇王 |Raō Gaiden - Ten no Haō}} by [[Youkow Osada]]. A series that was serialized in ''[http://www.comicbunch.com/comic_info/tenno_haou/index.html Weekly Comics Bunch]'' featuring characters from the ''Raoh Den'' film. 42 chapters had been published and collected in four volumes (with a fifth volume currently scheduled for the future).

* {{nihongo|''Yuria's Side Story: The Merciful Mother Star''|ユリア外伝 慈母の星|Yuria Gaiden - Jibo no Sei}} by [[Ayumi Kasai|Akimi Kasai]]. A three-part series serialized at ''Big Comics Superior'' from [[March 10]] to [[April 14]], [[2006]]. ''Big Comics Superior'' published six subsequent chapters from [[March 9]] to [[June 8]], [[2007]].

* {{nihongo|''Rei's Side-Story: The Magnificent Avenger''|レイ外伝 華麗なる復讐者|Rei Gaiden - Kareinaru Fukushūsha}}, a one-shot story by [[Mie Nekoi|Yasuyuki Nekoi]], published in the [[March 22]], [[2006]] issue of ''Comics Bunch Special''. A sequel was published in the [[December 8th]], [[2006]] issue. It has been picked up for serialization and retitled {{nihongo|''Rei's Side-Story: The Hungry Wolf Saga''|レイ外伝 ー餓狼編ー|Rei Gaiden - Garō Hen}}. The serialized version begun on the April 27, 2007 issue of ''Weekly Comic Bunch''.[http://www.comicbunch.com/magazine_info/index.html]

* {{nihongo|''Ryūken's Side-Story: Judgement Day''|リュウケン外伝－JUDGEMENT DAY－|Ryūken Gaiden JUDGEMENT DAY}}, a one shot story by [[Shin-ichi Hiromoto|Hiromoto Sin-Ichi]], published in the [[December 8th]] issue of Comic Bunch.

==English versions==
[[Image:FotNS Master Ed 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Fist of the North Star: Master Edition Vol. 1'', published by Gutsoon.]]
Two separate attempts were made to translate the original ''Fist of the North Star'' manga into the English market, although neither were completed. The first attempt by [[VIZ Media]] (back then known as VIZ Communications) began in [[1989]], in which the first sixteen chapters (the introductory chapter, along with King and Golan story arcs) were published in eight monthly [[prestige format]] installments and released under the ''VIZ Select Comics'' imprint. The publication promoted the North American release of the second ''[[Fist of the North Star (NES)|Hokuto no Ken]]'' video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. VIZ resumed publication of the series from [[1995]] to [[1997]], publishing three subsequent mini-series (covering the Jackal, Fang Clan and Jagi arcs) in monthly comic book-sized installments (each issue adapting a chapter and a half of the original manga, for a total of 28 chapters in 18 issues) . All 28 issues were reprinted in four collected volumes (''Fist of the North Star'', ''Night of the Jackal'', ''Southern Cross'' and ''Blood Brothers'').

In [[2003]], Gutsoon! Entertainment begin publishing the manga as a series of graphic novels under the ''Master Edition'' imprint, with each volume corresponding to the original ''Jump Comics'' volumes. These Master Editions retain the original right-to-left ordering and Japanese sound effects, but features new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] coloring that were not in the original serialized chapters and a different translation from the VIZ version. Nine volumes were published from [[2003]] to [[2004]] before Gutsoon folded. The cover of the tenth volume was released, but the book itself never published.

==Japanese collected volumes==
The original collected volumes or ''[[tankōbon]]'' of ''Hokuto no Ken'' were originally published under [[Shueisha]]'s ''Jump Comics'' (as with most ''Shonen Jump'' titles) and spans 27 volumes. During the [[1990's]], Shueisha reprinted ''Hokuto no Ken'' in 15 hardcover ''aizoban'' editions, as well as 15 corresponding economy-sized ''bunko'' editions. Most recently, it has republished in 31 ''Bunch World'' editions, 12 ''Tokuma Favorite Comics'' editions, 24 ''Raijin Collection'' editions and 14 ''Kanzeban'' editions. The ''Kazenban'' edition, published by [[Shogakukan]] under the ''Big Comics Selection'' imprint, features the original colored pages from the ''Weekly Shonen Jump'' serialization. It has also been released in 27 [[download|pay-to-download]] [[e-book]] editions by ''eBook Japan''. Coamix published the ''Master Edition'' of ''Hokuto no Ken'' in Japan, but ceased publication at volume 4, following the cancellation of its U.S. counterpart.

The following are the titles of the original ''Jump Comics'' volumes and a rough English translation of each title.

==Adaptations==
===TV series===
[[Image:Hokuto anime.jpg|thumb|right|TV's ''Hokuto no Ken'' title card.]]
[[Image:Hokuto2 anime.jpg|thumb|right|''Hokuto no Ken 2'' title card.]]
Like many popular manga titles in Japan, ''Hokuto no Ken'' was adaptated into a weekly anime series by [[Toei Animation]]. The original ''Hokuto no Ken'' anime series aired on [[Fuji Television]] from [[October 4]], [[1984]] to [[March 5]], [[1987]] and was given the foretitle of ''Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu'' (世紀末救世主伝説, ''Legend of the Century's End Savior'') following episode 22. It was immediately followed by a sequel series, titled ''Hokuto no Ken 2'', which aired from [[March 13]], [[1987]] to [[February 18]], [[1988]]. A combined total of 152 episodes were produced for the two series. It was later rerun in Japan on the [[satellite television]] network [[Animax]].

The violence was toned down considerably from the original manga, with many of the gore being discolored via desaturation, and scenes where children die would be rewritten so that Kenshiro would save the child at the last minute. Like many manga-based anime series, [[Filler (media)|filler]] material were added to prevent the series from getting ahead of the manga. 

The original ''Hokuto no Ken'' anime series covers the manga storyline from the beginning up to the Hokuto Shinken successorship dispute storyline and is divided into four main story arcs, each spanning a certain portion of the original manga. The first arc is the one which deviates the most from the manga. It covers the introductory chapter with Zeed up to the battle agaisnt Devil Rebirth and Jackal, but changes the order of events in order to pad out Shin's role as the ultimate villain for the first 22 episodes by leaving the final fight between Ken and Shin for last.

''Hokuto no Ken 2'' follows the manga after the several years jump following Ken's final battle with Raoh. It centers around Kenshiro's adventure with the now-adult Bat and Lin and spans the latter half of the manga. It ends the story with the final battle with Kaioh, omitting the later storylines following it.

** The Imperial Capital arc (天帝編, ''Tentei Hen'') - Episodes 110-122
** The Land of [[Ashura]] arc (修羅の国編, ''Shura no Kuni Hen'') - Episodes 123-152

The first 36 episodes were licensed to [[Manga Entertainment]] and released in English dubbed and subtitled formats on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. The original VHS release contains three episodes per tape (12 volumes in all), whereas the later DVD release contains 7-8 episodes per disc (five volumes in total). The dubbed version of the show featured all new background and theme music. It aired on [[Showtime Beyond]] in the US and on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United Kingdom)|Sci-Fi Channel]] in the UK.

The entire series has been collected on DVD in Japan, in a boxed collection titled ''Hokuto no Ken: Super Premium Box'' and in 26 individually released discs containing 5-6 episodes per volume. A three volume DVD series, the ''Kyūkyoku Retsuden'' series, contains highlight episodes of the show.

===1986 animated movie===
[[Image:FotNS02.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A promotional illustration of the ''Fist of the North Star'' animated movie.]]
The original ''Fist of the North Star'' animated film by [[Toei Animation]] premiered in Japan on [[March 8]], [[1986]], during the publication of the Last Nanto General arc of the manga and between the airings of episode #66 and #67 of the anime series (during the Souther arc). The movie was intended to be a big-screen treatment of the manga, and avoid the watering-down of violence that came with the TV series. The English-dubbed version was released on VHS in North America by [[Streamline Pictures]] in [[1991]].

In a notable deviation from the series, the film finds time to begin with a detailed peek at the Earth as it was before and during the fabled nuclear devastation. Starting with a calm, surreal look at various points of mother nature, a brief on-screen message then informs the audience of the imminent calamity, followed by unsettling scenes of human life consumed in flame.

The film follows the anime and manga from Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin to the first battle with Raoh, although certain liberties were taken to tell the story in a condensed form. Toki, the second of the four Hokuto Brothers, is never seen or mentioned. Out of the six Nanto Stars, only Shin, Rei and Yuria appear. While Yuria's Nanto heritage is mentioned thorought the movie in the Japanese version, her role as the Last Nanto General is downplayed. Mamiya, Rei's love interest, is never seen, partly because Yuria is the heroine in her place. 

Raoh serves as the main antagonist, with Jagi and Shin as the other two major villains. Many other villains from the manga such as the Colonel and Jackal only make cameo appearances as minor henchmen with some of the notable fight scenes involving Zeed, Heart, the Fang King and Uighur.

There were two endings produced for the film. The original theatrical ending in Japan showed Raoh emerging victorious over Kenshiro, but sparing his life, leaving him to protect Lin. An alternate ending was produced that was closer to the manga which shows the fight ending in a draw, which was ending featured in the VHS and Laserdisc release of the film in Japan. The English dub version by Streamline Pictures is based on the theatrical version and thus features the original ending. Many Western fans believe that the "draw ending" was the original ending, but this is a common misconception due to the fact that the original ending where Raoh wins is not featured in any of the official home video releases in Japan.

===The live-action movie===
[[Image:Fistmoviejap.jpg|thumb|90px|right|The Live-Action Movie (Toei)]]
Arguably the black sheep of the franchise, this 1995 film created by American director [[Tony Randel]] and starring [[Gary Daniels]] has a mixed reception among fandom. Some are acceptant of it, while detracting voices cite poor production values, too many deviations in this original script co-written by [[Peter Atkins]] & Wynne McLaughlin, and an inherent inability to capture the narrative quality of the anime and manga versions. The Japanese version, renamed ''Hokuto no Ken: Fist of the North Star'' (北斗の拳～フィスト・オブ・ザ・ノーススター～), was released in [[VHS]] the same year by Toei Video. Two editions were available, a subtitled one (字幕) and another one (吹替) dubbed by the '80s TV series' original cast. A ''Behind the Scenes of Hokuto no Ken: Fist of the North Star'' (ビハインド・シーン・オブ北斗の拳～フィスト・オブ・ザ・ノーススター～ ) documentary VHS was released two weeks before the movie itself by Toei Japan. The Japanese DVD edition released in 2004 contains both English and Japanese audio tracks but not the documentary.

===''New Fist of the North Star''===
''New Fist of the North Star'' (新・北斗の拳, ''Shin Hokuto no Ken'') is a three-part [[OVA]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]] that was originally released in [[2003]] and [[2004]] in Japan. It is based on an original ''Hokuto no Ken'' novel written by Buronson and Hara titled ''Jubaku no Machi'' (呪縛の街, "The Cursed City"), whom the first episode of the trilogy draws its title from. It was fully licensed and released in English by [[ADV Films]]. [[Akira Kamiya]], who had voiced Kenshiro in all previous anime incarnations, was replaced by [[Takehito Koyasu]] for this new OVA series. Celebrity voices were also employed, with musician [[Gackt]] (who also performs the opening and ending themes of the OVA) as the antagonist Seiji. It was the last animated incarnation of ''Hokuto no Ken'' produced by Toei.

Set sometime after the end of ''Hokuto no Ken 2'' and the original manga, a man named Sanga has constructed a fortified zone called The Last Land. While Sanga's men go out and seek water through violent means, they encounter Kenshiro who desires to end their reign of terror.

{{Trivia|date=June 2007}}
*In an issue of [[City Hunter]], Ryo Saeba morphed into Kenshiro when he boasted how good he was in voice impersonation. He sampled Kenshiro's catchphrase ''Omae wa mō shindeiru'' (おまえはもう死んでいる), meaning "You are already dead", which he usually says before a villain's head is about to explode. It was explained that [[Akira Kamiya]], a very famous seiyuu in Japan, did Kenshiro's and Ryo Saeba's voices in their respective animes.

*In the ninth episode of [[School Rumble]], [[Kenji Harima]] tells a story similar to the first season of Fist of the North Star, where he fashions himself as Kenshiro and fights an array of wildly dressed muscular minions in a post-apocalyptic desert world in an attempt to save his love, who is taken captive by his archrival who lives in a castle and dresses similar to Shin.  

*In the eighth episode of [[Great Teacher Onizuka]], Onizuka impersonates Kenshiro with the same Big Dipper shaped scars drawn on with a marker on his bare chest, the name Kenshiro in kanji on his forehead, and swollen veins drawn on his face.  He mentions to a group of bikers that he is saving Yuria from them, and counters their attacks with a series of rapid fire punches while imitating Kenshiro's trademark yells. 

*An episode of [[Mahoromatic]] features a female character claiming to grow more powerful with the more clothing she removes, referring to the technique as "Fist of the Nude Star".

*In the fourth episode of [[Magical Shopping Arcade]], Sasshi becomes Kenshiro after finishing his training, complete with the Big Dipper on his chest. However when he is hugged by Mune Mune, his head erupts and he returns to normal.

*[[Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo]] makes regular references to this series. Every character who fights has at least one "Shinken" technique, most notably the title character's "Hanage Shinken", or "Fist of the Nose Hair", a reference to Kenshirou's "Hokuto Shinken". However, shinken is spelled differently.

*In [[Project A-Ko]], B-Ko's underling Mari is basically Kenshiro in pigtails and a school uniform.

*In [[Air Gear]], after the main hero Ikki had eaten poisonous mushrooms due to a misunderstanding, he dons a headband with the name Daigoin Jaki, after Kenshiro's brother Jagi.

*[[Jūken Sentai Gekiranger]] has numerous references to Kenshiro's Hokuto Hyakuretsu Ken technique.  In episode 15, Gekiyellow is also able to do a variation of the Hokuto Zankai Ken by inserting her thumbs into the opponent's head with a similar yet non-lethal result.

* The 23rd episode of [[Excel Saga]] contained a sqeuence involving Excel fighting muscular bandits in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. She strikes one brutally, quotes Kenshiro's famous catchphrase, and his head appears to explode in rivers of blood - but, in fact, he has been super-deformed into a [[chibi]] [[catgirl]].

* In the 3rd episode of [[Hellsing (OVA)|Hellsing Ultimate]], the Major can be heard singing the first few lines of one fo the opening themes to the the Fist of the Northstar anime as they prepare to make war on England.
