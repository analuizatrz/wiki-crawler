The '''charismatic movement''' began with the adoption of certain beliefs typical of those held by [[Pentecostal]] Christians &mdash; specifically what are known as the biblical [[charism]]s or [[spiritual gift]]s: [[glossolalia]] (speaking in tongues), [[prophesying]], supernatural healing, etc. &mdash; by those within mainstream [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches. Many charismatic Christians went on to form separate churches and denominations.  The writings of [[John William Fletcher|John Fletcher]] were influential in beginning this movement, which was sparked by the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in California, which took place in 1906.  Though charismatic theology finds its roots in the [[Holiness Movement|Wesleyan-Holiness]] tradition, charismatics can now be found within numerous theological movements and in multiple denominations.    

'''Charismatic''' is an umbrella term used to describe those [[Christianity|Christians]] who believe that the manifestations of the [[Holy Spirit]] seen in the first century Christian Church, such as [[faith healing]], [[miracle]]s, [[prophecy]], and [[glossolalia]] (speaking in other tongues or languages), are available to contemporary Christians and ought to be experienced and practiced today. The word ''charismatic'' is derived from the Greek word ''χαρις'' (meaning a grace or a gift) which is the term used in the [[Bible]] to describe a wide range of supernatural experiences (especially in [[1 Corinthians]] 12-14).

Often confused with [[Pentecostalism]] (which inspired it {{Fact|date=June 2007}}), charismatic Christianity tends to differ in key aspects: most charismatics reject the preeminence given by Pentecostalism to [[glossolalia]], reject what they consider to be [[legalism (theology)|legalism]] sometimes associated with Pentecostalism, and often stay in their existing denominations such as [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal|Roman Catholic Charismatics]].

Because of the continual cross-over between Pentecostalism and the modern charismatic movement, it is increasingly difficult to speak of charismatics and Pentecostals as being part of separate movements. Yet because neither movement is [[monolithic]], it is inaccurate to speak of them as being one movement. The difference is primarily one of origins.  Beliefs of the two groups are very similar; each movement, however, is unique in its historical beginnings.  Having been conceived in unique contexts, the difference may secondarily be described in terms of contrasting church cultures evidenced through each movement's manners and customs (i.e., worship styles, preaching styles, altar ministry methods).  Until a more acceptable broad nomenclature is used, it needs to be understood that both movements share a great deal in common, and yet can sometimes be clearly differentiated.

==History==
===Beginnings 1950-1975===
While it is difficult to locate the place and time that charismatic Christianity began to influence the mainstream churches, [[Dennis Bennett]], an American Episcopalian, is often cited as the movement's seminal influence. Bennett was the Rector at St Mark's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Church in [[Van Nuys]] California when he announced to the congregation in 1960 that he had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Soon after this he was ministering in [[Vancouver]] where he ran many workshops and seminars about the work of the Holy Spirit.[http://www3.telus.net/st_simons/arm12.htm] This influenced tens of thousands of Anglicans world-wide and also began a renewal movement within the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.

In the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] there was a renewed interest in the supernatural "gifts of the Spirit" in mainstream churches such as the Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, Anglican, and Catholic churches. The [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] was focused in individuals like [[Kevin Ranaghan]] and others at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]]. [[Dennis Bennett]] was Ranaghan's counterpart in the Episcopal Church. Meanwhile, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Colin Urquhart]], [[Michael Harper]], [[David Watson]] and others were in the vanguard of similar developments. The Roman Catholic Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, began hosting charismatic revivals in 1977, which coincided with Jimmy Carter's election and the "born from above" or "born again" explosion.

In both the UK and [[New Zealand]] there was significant overlap between ex-[[Brethren]] charismatics and those of mainstream churches. Brethren men such as [[Campbell McAlpine]] and [[Arthur Wallis]] visited [[New Zealand]] for the renowned [[Massey University|Massey]] conference in [[1964]].  This was attended by several Anglicans including, the Rev. Ray Muller who went on to invite [[Dennis Bennett]] to New Zealand in [[1966]], and played a leading role in developing and promoting the ''Life in the Spirit'' seminars. Other leaders in the New Zealand movement included Baptist Wyn Fountain and Auckland Anglican [[Ken Prebble]].<ref>Lineham, Peter (1982), Tongues Must Cease.</ref><ref>Knowles, Brett (1999), New Life: The New Life Churches of New Zealand: 1942-1979</ref>

The charismatic renewal movement in the Eastern Orthodox Church never exerted the influence that it did in other mainstream churches. Individual priests, such as Fr. [[Eusebius Stephanou]] of the Greek Orthodox Orthodox Archdiocese of North America, founder of the Brotherhood of St. Symeon the New Theologian, Fr. [[Athanasius Emmert]] of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese and Fr. [[Boris Zabrodsky]] of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] in America, founder of the Service Committee for Orthodox Spiritual Renewal (SCOSR) which published "[[Theosis]]" Newsletter, were some of the more prominent leaders of the charismatic renewal in Orthodoxy.

On an international level, [[David du Plessis]] along with a host of others (including [[Lutheran]] and even [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] ministers) promoted the movement. The latter did not last long with their denominations, either volunteering to leave or being asked to do so. But in the Episcopal and Catholic churches priests were permitted to continue on in their parishes, provided they did not allow these concerns to create major divisions within their congregations.

===Change 1975-2000===
While there are many charismatics within established denominations, many have left or have been forced out and have joined either more progressive Pentecostal churches or formed their own churches or denominations. The [[house church]] movement in the UK and the [[Vineyard movement]] in the USA are examples of a formal charismatic structure. The [[Hillsong Church]] in Australia is an example of a Pentecostal church that has embraced charismatic belief and practices, which has, in turn, influenced the Australian [[Assemblies of God]] denomination. In New Zealand, the pre-eminent Pentecostal movement has been the [[New Life Churches]], although other local and international Pentecostal denominations are also well established.

Since the mid 1980s, the charismatic movement has made some notable changes in its theology and emphases. This process has been termed ''[[Third Wave of the Holy Spirit|The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit]]'' and has been typified by the ministry of [[C. Peter Wagner]], [[Word of faith|Word-faith Theology]] and the [[Toronto blessing]] phenomenon. Some opponents of the charismatic movement have noted that these recent trends have been influenced heavily by the [[Latter Rain Movement]] of the [[1950s]] within the [[Pentecostal]] churches &mdash; a movement that was officially declared [[heresy]] by [[Assemblies of God|The Assemblies of God]] at the time.

There appears to be a great deal of evidence which shows that, since 1975, the charismatic movement has been influenced by the [[Latter Rain Movement]] and its influential teachers (such as [[William M. Branham]]). This can be explained by the desire of charismatic Christians to enter into fellowship with those within the Christian church who have experienced similar forms of [[Religious ecstasy]]. As a result of this, charismatics came into contact with both mainstream Pentecostalism as well as the [[Latter Rain Movement]]. It appears that modern-day charismatics and Pentecostals are far more united in experience and theology because both movements have adopted elements of Latter Rain teachings.

==Charismatics: a world perspective==
As noted earlier, Pentecostal and charismatic are often used interchangeably.  With that in mind, according to ''Christianity Today'', Pentecostalism is "a vibrant faith among the poor; it reaches into the daily lives of believers, offering not only hope but a new way of living." [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html].  In addition, according to a 1999 U.N. report, "Pentecostal churches have been the most successful at recruiting its members from the poorest of the poor."  [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html] Also, according to Christianity Today, in Brazilian churches, where Pentecostal Christians are often very poor, "Preachers constantly ask parishioners to give what seem like laughable sums of money; these people tithe 20, 30, and sometimes as much as 50 percent of their income." [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html]  Christianity Today also noted that 
Brazilian Pentecostals talk of Jesus as someone real and close to them and doing things for them including providing food and shelter. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html]  In addition, according to Christianity Today, "Scholars have long branded Pentecostalism an eminently 'otherworldly' religion, focused more on things above than the mundane below. To many that seems like a foregone conclusion, given the movement's emphasis on charismatic experiences, intense religiosity, and ascetic tendencies. Even highly respected Pentecostal scholars argue this point." [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html]

==Charismatic movement and Pentecostalism==

The charismatic movement shares many similarities with [[Pentecostalism]], and the stages of the latter seem to have been a prerequisite for the further developing of the said topic. The influence of Pentecostalism upon the charismatic movement cannot be denied. Both acknowledge the power of the [[Holy Spirit]]. [[Faith healing]] has major acceptance among adherents of both faiths, and both are known for their fiery services. Even still, many differences will allow a person to discern a charismatic from a Pentecostal, though some consider themselves both.

Pentecostals developed their own denomination, but charismatics tend to remain in their respective established churches or religious bodies. Charismatics have been susceptible to criticism that exceeds that of Pentecostalism, but criticism of both is widespread in comparison to other religious movements. Pentecostalism also developed significantly earlier than the charismatic Movement.

== Catholicism ==
:''Main article: [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]]''

Charismatic Christians are not exclusive to any single denomination, and indeed, charismatic theology is not even uniquely [[Protestant]]. There is a burgeoning charismatic movement within the [[Catholic Church]], and [[Pope John Paul II]] was reputed to have had a charismatic priest as his personal pastor.

In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, the movement became particularly popular in the Filipino and Hispanic communities of the United States, and in the Philippines itself. Traveling priests and lay people associated with the movement often visit parishes and sing what are known as charismatic masses. It is thought to be the second largest distinct sub-movement within Roman Catholicism, along with [[Traditional Catholicism]]. It presents a difficult situation for many Church authorities, who, as always, must be careful to admit innovation only where it is clear the innovation is consistent with the [[Bible]] and the teachings of the Church.

== Criticism of the movement ==
With the rise in popularity and influence of the charismatic movement, a number of criticisms have arisen from Christians who are outside the movement. [[Cessationism|Cessationists]] (popular amongst [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Fundamentalists]] and [[Southern Baptists]]) believe that the spiritual gifts that charismatics experience are no longer available to the church, and argue that these experiences are demonic and/or psychological in nature.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} The Southern Baptist Organization in a recent controversial move actually voted to forbid the practice of glossolalia among their members.<ref>The SBC published the a contoversial paper after a November 2005 meeting to address the issue of glossalalia within their ranks, with a particular focus on new mission candidates. [http://www.sbc.net/redirect.asp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eimb%2Eorg%2Fcore%2Fstory%2Easp%3FstoryID%3D3834%26LanguageID%3D1709&key=glossolalia&title=Policy+on+tongues+and+prayer+language+%2D+International+Mission+Board%2C+SBC&ndx=SBC%2C+IMB%2C+NAMB%2C+ANNUITY%2C+LIFEWAY%2C+WMU%2C+ERLC%2C+SEMINARIES]</ref>

Critics sometimes use the word in a derisive manner and generally believe and teach that charismatics are everything from shallow to dangerous &mdash; even demon possessed, although this latter charge is increasingly rare as charismatic and Pentecostal groups become more established in the religious landscape.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

Criticism of the movement from outside of the Christian church partly stems from the alleged indoctrination of children at a young age.  This issue is highlighted in the documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]''.
