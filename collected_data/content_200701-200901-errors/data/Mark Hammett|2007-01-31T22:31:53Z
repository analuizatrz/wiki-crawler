'''Mark Garry Hammett''' (born [[13 July]] [[1972]] in [[Christchurch]]) is a [[rugby union]] [[coach]] and former [[New Zealand]] rugby union player. Hammett played provincial rugby for [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]], as a [[Rugby union positions#2. Hooker|hooker]], between 1992 and 2002. When the [[Crusaders]] franchise was formed for the [[Super 12]] in 1996, Hammett was contracted, becoming a founding player. He continued to play for the Crusaders until 2003; winning four championships in the process. He first played for the [[All Blacks]] in 1999, and played until his retirement following the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. Hammett represented Canterbury 76 times, the Crusaders 81 times, and the All Blacks 30 times (including 29 [[Test match|Tests]]). After retiring from playing, he began coaching, and worked as forwards advisor for both the Crusaders and Canterbury in 2006. He was appointed to succeed Vern Cotter as assistant coach at the Crusaders for the 2007 season.
