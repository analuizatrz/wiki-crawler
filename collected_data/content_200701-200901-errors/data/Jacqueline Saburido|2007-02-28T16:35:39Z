'''Jacqueline Saburido''' (b. [[December 20]], [[1978]]) is a [[drunk driving]] accident survivor.

==About Jacqueline==

The only child of Rosalia and Amadeo, 20 year old Jacqui Saburido had lived in [[Caracas, Venezuela]] all her life. Living with her father after her parents divorce, Jacqui began studying engineering in the hope of taking over the family airconditioning business.
In 1999, Jacqui was struggling in college and decided to take a break. She took a trip to Texas to study English.

==The accident==

On [[September 19]], [[1999]], Jacqui attended a birthday party. She and her friends Laura Guerrero, Johan Daal and Johanna Gil, accepted a ride home from a classmate,  Natalia Chpytchak Bennett. [[Reginald Stephey]], an 18-year-old [[high school]] student, was on his way home after drinking beer with friends. On the outskirts of [[Austin, Texas]], Stephey's 1996 [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] veered into Natalia's 1990 [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight]] Regency carrying Saburido and the others. Laura and Natalia were killed instantly. Johanna and Johan were injured but not seriously. Jacqui's legs were pinned by the crumpled dashboard.

The car caught [[fire]]. Two paramedics, John McIntosh and Bryan Fitzpatrick, happened to be driving past when Reggie flagged them down. The flames were leaping several feet up into the air as they arrived. McIntosh put out the fire with his extinguisher and the two men set about removing everyone from the vehicle.

But Jacqui was trapped, and the fire returned. McIntosh and Fitzpatrick were forced back, and Jacqui was left to burn for around 45 seconds as the flames engulfed the vehicle. A firetruck arrived and put out the fire, Jacqui was cut from the car and airlifted to the burns unit in Galveston.

She was burned over 60% of her body, mainly third degree but in some places fourth and fifth degree burns. Doctors gave her no chance of survival, but decided to "throw everything they had at her."  Miraculously, Jacqui managed to pull through against all odds. Due to the severity of her burns, all of her fingers had to be [[amputate]]d. She lost her hair, her ears, her nose, her lips, her eyelids and much of her vision. She has had more than 50 operations since the crash, including cornea transplants which have allowed her to see again.

==Aftermath==

In June 2001 Reginald Stephey was convicted on two counts of [[vehicular homicide|intoxicated manslaughter]]. He was sentenced to two concurrent seven-year prison sentences and fined $20,000. An appeal was refused.

Bravely, Jacqui decided to use her tragedy to help others. She allowed graphic post-accident photographs of herself to be used in the media (posters, TV commercials, and internet chain mail) to illustrate a possible outcome of a drunk driving accident. She is most well known for a commercial in which she holds a pre-accident photo of herself in front of the camera, which she lowers to reveal her disfigured face and says "This is me, after being hit by a drunk driver."

Jacqui appeared on the [[Oprah Winfrey]] Show on [[November 17]], [[2003]]. She was also interviewed on the Australian 60 Minutes on [[March 14]], [[2004]], and featured in a Discovery Health documentary on face transplants. Jacqui continues to inspire millions with her bravery, her positive outlook, and her tireless campaign to educate people on drunk driving. Oprah said that Jacqui was the one person she had met who defined inner beauty.

Jacqui is currently living in Venezuela after years in the US getting treatments for her injuries. Her mother Rosalia has just been diagnosed with cancer.
