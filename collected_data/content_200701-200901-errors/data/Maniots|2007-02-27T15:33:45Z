The '''Maniots''' (or '''Maniates'''; Greek: '''Μανιάτες''') are the Greek inhabitants of the [[Mani Peninsula]] (the middle leg of the Peloponnese) located in the southern [[Peloponnese]] in the Greek [[Laconia|prefecture of Laconia]] and [[Messinia|prefecture of Messinia]]. They were also formerly known as '''Mainotes''' in [[English language|English]] and the peninsula as ''Maina''. Etymologically, the name "Maniot" means "one who comes from Mani". Geographically, the peninsula itself is an extension of the [[Taygetus]] mountain range. The Maniots deem themselves an ancient Greek people who descend from the [[Lacedaemonian]]s ([[Sparta]]ns). Throughout history, the Maniots were known by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practiced [[blood feud]]s. 

As early as [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, the Maniots were also known to have conducted acts of [[piracy]]. This being a result of the people of Mani lacking raw materials and resources, as well as not possessing sufficient capital for overseas trade. For the most part, the Maniots lived in fortified villages (and "house-towers") where they defended their lands against the Ottomans and even against the armies of [[William II Villehardouin]].

===Mycenaean Mani===

[[Homer]]'s "[[Catalogue of ships]]" in the ''[[Iliad]]'' mentions the cities of Mani: Messi (Mezapos), Oetylus (Oitylo), Kardamili (or Skardamoula), Gerenia, Teuthone (Kotronas) and Las (Passavas).<ref name="Homer 2.581">[[#Homer|Homer]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+2.581]</ref> Under the Mycenaeans, Mani flourished.<ref name="Kassis7">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 7</ref> At Cape [[Tenaro]], a temple dedicated to the ancient Greek god of light was built. It was of such importance that it rivalled Delphi which was then a temple dedicated to [[Poseidon]].<ref name="Kassis7">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 7</ref> Later however, the temple of Tenaro became dedicated to Posiedon and the one at Delphi to Apollo. According to other legends, there is a cave near Tenaro that leads to [[Hades]].<ref name="Kassis7">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 7</ref> Mani also featured in other mythological tales as [[Helen of Troy]] and [[Paris]] sent their first night together on the island of [[Cranae]], off the coast of Gytheio.<ref name="Kassis7">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 7</ref>

In the [[12th century BC]], the Dorians invaded [[Laconia]].<ref name="Saitas13">Saitas, ''Mani", 13</ref> The Dorians originally settled at [[Sparta]], but they soon started to expand their territory and by around 800 BC they had taken over Mani and the rest of the Laconia.<ref name="Saitas13">Saitas, ''Mani", 13</ref> Mani's inhabitants were given the social caste of [[Perioeci]].<ref name="Saitas13">Saitas, ''Mani", 13</ref> During that time, the [[Phoenicia]]ns came to Mani and were thought to have established a colony at [[Gythium]].<ref name="Fermor"> Fermor.

===Classical Mani===

During the Spartan domination of Mani, Tenaro became an important gathering place for mercenaries who wanted to be hired.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos20">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 20</ref> Gythium became a major port under the Spartans as it was only 27 kilometres away from Sparta. In 455 BC, during the [[First Peloponnesian War]], it was besieged and captured by the Athenian [[admiral]], [[Tolmides]] along with 50 triremes and 4,000 hoplites.<ref name="Fermor"> Fermor.

===Hellenistic Mani===

During the Hellenistic period of Greece, Mani remained under Spartan control. The Macedonians under the command of [[Philip V of Macedon]] invaded Mani and Laconia in 219 BC-218 BC, but unsuccessfully besieged the cities of Gythium, [[Passavas|Las]] and [[Skoutari (Laconia), Greece|Asine]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos20">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 20</ref> When [[Nabis]], took over the Spartan throne in 207 BC, he began some reforms. Amongst them was to make Gythium into a major port and naval arsenal.<ref name="Green302">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 302</ref> In 195 BC, during the [[Roman-Spartan War]], the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Achean League]] with assistance from a combined Pergamese and Rhodian captured Gythium after a lengthy siege.<ref name="Livy 34.29">[[#Livy|Livy]] [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy34.html 34.29]</ref>

The allies went on to besiege Sparta and force Nabis to surrender.

==Roman Mani==

The Maniots lived in peace until 146 BC. That year the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]] resulted in the destruction of [[Corinth]] by the forces of [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]] and the annexation of the [[Achaean League]] by the [[Roman Republic]].<ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref> The Romans conquered the Peloponnese, but the Koinon was allowed to retain its independence.<ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref>

The Maniots suffered from pirate raids by Cretan and [[Cilicia|Cilicians]] who plundered Mani and pillaged the temple of [[Poseidon]].<ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref> The Maniots were delivered from the pirates when [[Pompey the Great]] defeated them. Most probably in gratitude, the Maniots supplied Pompey with archers in his battles against [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's civil war]] (49 BC - 45 BC).<ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref>

During the [[Civil war between Antony and Octavian]] (32 BC - 30 BC), the Maniots and Laconians assisted [[Augustus]] by sending him men to join his navy. Augustus defeated [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] ([[September 2]], [[31 BC]]) and in gratitude, he officially recognized the Koinon and visited [[Psamathous]] and it became a semi-independent state.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref><ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref> This signified the beginning of the Golden Age of the Koinon.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref>

Mani flourished under the Romans. The Koinon consisted of 24 cities (later 18), of which Gythium remained the prominent. However, some parts of Mani remained under the also semi-independent Sparta, the most notable being Asine and Karymili.<ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref> The Mani became the center of the purple dye, which was popular in [[Rome]] as well as being well known for it's rose antique marble and [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]].<ref name="Fermor"> Fermor. ''Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponesse.'', 302 </ref> Las is recorded to have been a comfortable city with Roman baths and a gymnasium.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos49">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 49</ref> 

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias the geographer]] left us a description of the town as it existed during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (reigned 161 - 180). The agora, the Acropolis, the island of Cranae (Marathonisi) where Paris celebrated his nuptials with Helen of Troy, the Migonium or precinct of [[Aphrodite]] Migonitis (occupied by the modern town), and the hill Larysium (Koumaro) rising above it. Nowadays, the most noteworthy remains of the theatre and the buildings partially submerged by the sea all belong to the Roman period.<ref>[[#Pausanias|Pausanias]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+3.21.8 3.21.8]</ref>

The Koinon remained semi-independent until the provincial reforms of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] in 297 AD.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref> With the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasion]] affecting the [[Roman Empire]], Mani became a haven for refugees.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos49">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 49</ref> In 375 AD, the massive earthquake in the area took its toll on Gythium which was severely devastated.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref>

==Medieval Mani==
[[Image:ByzantineEmpire717AD2lightpurple.PNG|thumb|right|400px|A map of the Byzantine Empire showing Mani and the eastern Peloponnese as part of the Empire (the rest of the Peloponnese was occupied by Avars), ''c.'' 717]]

===From Theodosius I to the Avar invasion===

On [[January 17]], [[395]], [[Theodosius I]] who had managed to unite the [[Roman Empire]] under his control died. His eldest son [[Arcadius]] succeeded him in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] while his younger son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] received the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The Roman Empire had split for the last time and Mani became part of the Eastern or [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref>

Between 395 and 397, [[Alaric I]] and his [[Visigoths]] plundered the [[Peloponnese]] and destroyed what was left of Gythium.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref> Alaric captured the most famous cities, [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]], and [[Sparta]], selling many of their inhabitants into slavery. He was at last defeated by [[Stilicho]] and then crossed the [[Gulf of Corinth]] towards the north. 

In 468, [[Genseric]] of the [[Vandals]], trying to conquer Mani, with the purpose of using it as a base to raid the Peloponnese and then conquer the Peloponnese.<ref name="Fermor120">Fermor, ''Mani:Travels into the Southern Peloponnese", 120</ref> Genseric tried to land his fleet at [[Kenipolis]] but as his army disembarked the inhabitants of the town attacked the Vandlas and made them retreat after they suffered heavy casualties.<ref name="Fermor120">Fermor, ''Mani:Travels into the Southern Peloponnese", 120</ref>

Byzantine general [[Belisarius]] on the way to his campaign against the Vandals, stopped at Kenipolis to get supplies, honor the Kenipolians, for their victory and to recruit some soldiers.<ref name="Kassis19">Kassis, "Mani's History", 19</ref> In 590, the [[Eurasian Avars]], a barbarian tribe attacked and occupied most of western Peloponnese.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref>

===During the Macedonian dynasty===

Eastern Roman Emperor [[Constantine VII]] (reigned 945 - 959) wrote the [[De Administrando Imperio]], between 948 and 952. It served as an internal and foreign policy manual to be used by his son and successor, [[Romanus II]].  Included in this manual was a description of Mani and its inhabitants:

{{cquote|''Be it known that the inhabitants of [[Megali Maini|Castle Maina]] are not from the race of aforesaid [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] but from the older Romaioi, who up to the present time are termed Hellenes by the local inhabitants on account of their being in olden times idolaters and worshippers of idols like the ancient Greeks, and who were baptized and became Christians in the reign if the glorious [[Basil I|Basil]]. The place in which they live is waterless and inaccessible, but has olives from which they gain some consolation.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref>}} 

The area inhabited by the Maniates was first called by the name "Maina" and was associated with the castle of [[Tigani]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref> The Maniots during that time were deemed [[paganism|pagan]] "Hellenes" or practitioners of pagan Greek culture (see [[Names of the Greeks]]) and were only [[Christianization|Christianized]] fully in the [[9th century]] AD, though some church ruins from the [[4th century]] AD indicate that [[Christianity]] was practiced by some Maniots in the region at an earlier time.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref> The Maniots were the last inhabitants of Greece to openly follow the pagan [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] religion. This can be explained by the mountainous nature of Mani's terrain, which enabled them to escape the attempts of the Eastern Roman Empire to Christianize Greece by force.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref>

===Under the Principality of Achaea===

During the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1201 - 1204), the Crusaders captured [[Constantinople]]. The Eastern Roman Empire was in effect partitioned between several Greek and Latin successor states, notably including (from west to east) the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos23">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 23</ref> These four produced rival lines of emperors, struggling for control over each other and the rest of the semi-independent states emerging in the area. 

[[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I Villehardouin]] defeated the Peloponnesian Greeks at the [[Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros]] (1205) and made the Peloponnese in the [[Principality of Achaea]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos23">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 23</ref> In 1210, Mani was given to Baron [[Jean de Neuilly]] as [[Hereditary Marshal]] and he built the castle of [[Passavas]] on the ruins of Las.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos23">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 23</ref><ref name="Kassis23">Kassis, "Mani's History", 23</ref> The castle occupied a significant position as it control the important pass from Gythium to [[Oitylo]] as well as containing the Maniots to Mani.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos23">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 23</ref>

The Maniots, however, were not easily contained and they were not the only threat to the Frankish occupation of the Peloponnese. The [[Melengi]], a [[Slavic]] tribe in the [[Taygetus]] [[mountain range]], raided Laconia from the west and the [[Tsakonians]] also resisted the Franks.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> In 1249, the new prince, [[William II of Villehardouin]], acted against the raiders. He used the newly captured fortress of [[Monemvasia]] to keep the Tsakones at bay and he built the castle at [[Mystras]] in the Tayegatus mountains over looking Sparta to contain the Melingi.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> To stop the Maniot raids, he built the castle of [[Megali Maini]] which is most probably [[Tigani]]. It is described as ''at a fearful cliff with a headland above''.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref>

A Latin bishop was appointed for Mani during the 1250s.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> In 1259, he was defeated and was captured during the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] by the renewed Byzantine Empire under the leadership of Nicaea.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref>

===Under the Despotate of Morea===

[[Image:ShepherdByzempire1265.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing the Byzantine Empire in 1265.]]

On [[July 25]], [[1261]], the Byzantines under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] recaptured Constantinople. Prince William was set free on the condition that he had to surrender the fortresses of Megali Maina, Mystras and Monemvasia, as well as surrender hostages including Lady Maragret, Baroness of Passavas.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref>

With the Franks gone from Laconia, the Maniots lived in peace under the [[Despotate of Morea]], whose successive [[Despotes]] governed the province. Mani seemed to have been dominated by the Nikliani family who were refugees.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref>{{cref|Social Castes of Mani}} However, the peace end when the Ottoman Turks started their attacks on the Peloponnese.

==Ottoman times==

[[Image:Ottoman.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Map of the Ottoman Empire.]]

===15th century===
After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to [[Mehmed II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] on [[May 29]],  [[1453]], the Maniots persisted in maintaining their autonomy.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> In May 1460, Sultan Mehmed II occupied the entire Peloponnese. The Despotate of Moreas was under two brothers of [[Constantine XI]] who had died defending Constantinople.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> However neither [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] nor [[Thomas Palaiologos]] chose to follow his example. They did not defend the Peloponnese. Instead, Thomas fled to [[Italy]] while Demetrious sought refuge with Mehmed himself.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> [[Helena Palaiologina]], a daughter of Demetrios and Theodora Asanina was given in marriage to Mehmed II. 
	
Kladas, a Greek from Laconia, was granted lordship over [[Elos]] and Varvounia, in 1461, by Mehmed who hoped he would defend Laconia from the Maniots.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> During that time, Mani's population grew a lot because of all the refugees that come from other areas of Greece.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref>{{cref|Population of Mani}} In 1463, Kladas turned against the Ottomans and joined the Venetians. Kladas lead the Maniots against the Ottomans with Venetian help until 1479 when the Venetians made peace with the Ottomans and gave the Ottoman's the right to rule 'Brazzo di Maina.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> Kladas refused to accept the conditions so the Venetians put a price on his head.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref>

After the end of the Turco-Venetian War, the Venetians left the Maniots to fend for themselves. Many of the Greeks who had revolted alongside the Venetians were massacred by the Ottomans, but many of them fled to find refuge in Mani. The Maniots continued to resist and Mehmed sent an army of 2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry against Mani under the command of Ale Boumico. <ref name="Kassis28">Kassis, "Mani's History", 28</ref> The Venetians trying to gain favour with the Porte handed over some Maniot rebels.<ref name="Kassis29">Kassis, "Mani's History", 29</ref> The Ottomans reached Oitylo before Kladas and the Maniots attacked the them and massacred them.

A month later, a larger force under the command of [[Ahmed Bey]] invaded Mani and drove Kladas to [[Porto Kagio]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html |title=Turkokratia: Kladas Revolt

===16th century===

From 1500 to 1570, Mani kept its autonomy with out any invasion from the Ottomans.<ref name="Kassis29">Kassis, "Mani's History", 29</ref> The Ottomans were busy with driving the Venetians out of the Peloponnese and succeeded in 1540, when they conquered Monemvasia and [[Nauplio]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 25</ref> The Ottomans under [[Selim II]], getting ready to invade the Venetian island of [[Cyprus]], built a fortress in Mani, at Porto Kaigo, and their also garrisoned Passavas.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 25</ref> The aim of this was to cut off the Venetian's communication lines and to keep the Maniots at bay.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 25</ref> Alarmed the Maniots called upon Venetian assistance and the Venetian navy in combination with the Maniot army captured the castle.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 25</ref>

===17th century===

In 1603, the Maniot approached [[Pope Clement VIII]], who had recently taken the [[crusade|cross]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref> Clement died two years later and the Maniots began to seek a new champion and they centerd their attention on the King of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref> They said to him to land his army at Porto Kaiyo and the Maniots would join him with 15,000 armed men as well as 80,000 other Peloponnesians.<ref name="Kassis29">Kassis, "Mani's History", 29</ref> The Maniots also sent envoys to some major powers of the Mediterranean, like the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Ancien Régime in France|Kingdom of France]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and once again [[Spain]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref> These states were interested and sent several expeditionary forces to Mani, but they all failed to achieve anything with the exception of a Spanish expedition that sacked Passavas.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref>

In 1645, the [[Turkish-Venetian War]] or "Cretan War" began. The Republic of Venice was attempting to defend [[Crete]], one of their provinces since 1204, from an attempt to expand the Ottoman Empire, initially under [[Ibrahim I]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref> The Maniots supported the Venetians by offering them ships.

==Modern Mani==
===Early 19th century===

In [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1803)|1803]], the Ottomans deposed of Koumoundourakis because he was not capable of subduing Zanetbey who was still receiving weapons from the French at his castle at [[Cranae]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 31</ref> The Ottomans replaced him with Antony or Antonbey, Zanetbey's cousin.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 31</ref> The Turkish fleet under the command of the [[admiral]], [[Seremet]].<ref name="Kassis37">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 37</ref> The Ottoman fleet was not able to captured Cranae and they were soon forced to retreat.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 31</ref>

The society called the [[Filiki Eteria]] ("Company of Friends") sent their representatives Perrevos and Chrisospathis to organize the Maniots.<ref name="Paroulakis40">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 40</ref> On [[March 17]], [[1821]], 12,000 Maniots gathered in the church of Taxiarchs (Archangels) of Areopoli and declared war against the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 58</ref> The flag of the revolution was white with a blue cross in the center. On top of the flag there was a sign: "[[Victory or death]]".<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref> The Maniots were responsible for writing "Victory" and not "Freedom" on their banner since Mani was always free.<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref> On the bottom of the flag lied an ancient inscription: "With the shield or on the shield."<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref>

On the [[21 March]], an army of 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petros Mavromichalis, [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] and [[Papaflessas]] marched towards [[Kalamata]].<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref> On the [[23 March]], they captured the city.<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref> From Kalamata, Mavromichalis wrote letters to the states of [[Europe]], informing them of what the Greeks were doing.<ref name="Paroulakis58">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 58</ref> The Messenian  Senate was also held there. Kolokotronis wanted to attack Tripolis and thus captured the main Turkish city in the Peloponnese.<ref name="Paroulakis58">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 58</ref> However, Mavromichalis wanted to capture the smaller towns first and then take Tripolis.<ref name="Paroulakis58">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 58</ref> The Senate agreed with Mavromichalis and the Maniots attacked the Turks of Messenia and Laconia.<ref name="Paroulakis58">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 58</ref> 

Kolokotronis convinced that he was correct, moved into [[Arcadia]] with 300 Maniots. When he entered Arcadia his band of 300 fought a Turkish force of 1,300 men and defeated them.<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref> On the [[28 April]], a few thousand Maniot soldiers under the command of Mavromichalis' sons joined Kolokotronis' camp outside Tripolis. On the [[12 September]] of that year, the Turkish capital in the Peloponnese fell. On the [[4 July]] that year, Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis was killed near the [[Suli|Souliote]] fortress of [[Kaiapha]].

[[Mahmud II]] became desperate and in 1824 he called on his [[Viceroy]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] to aid him.<ref name="Paroulakis113">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 113</ref> Ali promised to aid him in return for cession of the island of [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] as well as making his eldest son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]], Pasha of the [[Peloponnese]].<ref name="Paroulakis113">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 113</ref> Ali accepted the offer and sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries which caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son [[Panos Kolokotronis|Panos]] was killed and his nephew [[Nikitaras]] forced to flee.<ref name="Paroulakis113">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 113</ref> 

Ibrahim made good use of this turmoil and landed with his army at [[Methoni]]. Ibrahim soon had re-captured all the Peloponnese except for [[Nauplio]] and Mani. When he tried to capture Nauplio, he was repelled by [[Dimitrios Ypsilantis]] and [[Konstantinos Mavromichalis]], Petros' brother. <ref name="Paroulakis125">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 125</ref> Ibrahim then decided to head for Mani.

Ibrahim sent an envoy to the Maniot demanding that they surrender or else he would ravage their land.<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref> Instead of surrendering the Maniots gave him a Maniotic reply saying:

''From the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We received your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and wait for you.''<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref>

Enraged by the reply, Ibrahim commanding an army of 7,000 men attacked Mani on the [[21 June]], [[1826]].<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref> He was stopped at the walls of [[Almiro]] and [[Vergas_Mani|Vergas]] which ran for around 500 meters.<ref name="Saitis12">Saitis, ''Mani", 12</ref> Defending the walls were 2,000 Maniots under the command of Illias Mavromichalis and 500 Greek refugees.<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref><ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> As Ibrahim launched his infantry and cavalry against the Maniot position, he also made two of his ships, including the one he was on, to attack the Maniot fortifactions from the sea with their artillery.<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref> The Egyptian army attacked the Maniot position eight times and they were thrown back.<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref> The fighting continued for a few more days before the Egyptians retreated when rumors that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 came true.<ref name="Barrow21">Barrow, ''The Mani", 21</ref> The Maniots pursued the Egyptians all the way to Kalamata before returning to Vergas.<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref> This battle was costly for Ibrahim not only because he suffered 2,500 casualties but also it ruined his plan to invade Mani from the north.<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref>

While Ibrahim was launching his attack on the Maniot position at Vergas, he decided to launch a small fleet and attack [[Areopolis]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> This plan is described by Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos as ''excellent'' because of the fact that it would catch Areopolis scarcely defend and by capturing Areopolis, Ibrahim could cut off the Maniots communication lines and control the mountains passes that led to [[Gytheio]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> It would also allow the Egyptian to attack the Maniot at Vergas from the rear.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref>

On the [[24 June]], he sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 to land at the Bay of Diros and to capture Areopolis.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> As the Egyptians land on the beach, the alarms bells rang.<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref> Soon 300 women and old men who had been harvesting the crops gathered.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> Armed only with their scythes and cudgels, they charged at the Egyptians.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> The Egyptians had not been expecting any resistance were surprised by this sudden attack and were forced to retreat to a fortified position on the beach were they could receive support from the ships.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> Soon 300 Maniots arrived from other towns and the Egyptians were forced to either swim to the ships or be slain by the Maniots.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> His defeat was costly for Ibrahim not only did he loose 1,000 men but his plan to invade conquer Mani were ruined.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos63">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 63</ref> Later on the women of Diro were dubbed the 'Amazons of Diro'.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos63">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 63</ref>

Ibrahim annoyed by his defeats at Vergas and Diro plundered the Peloponnese for a month before turning his attention back to Mani.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> He sent an army of 6,000 Arabs to advance it to the Taygetus and sweep down and captured Gytheio and Laconian Mani.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> In command of the army was a Greek from Vordonia, [[Bosinas]].<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> As he advanced towards Polytsaravo he was stopped by Theodoros Stathakos, who together with his family of thirteen people was waiting in their tower.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> Bosinas tried to make him surrender and give up his and Theodoros feigning to surrender allowed Bosinas to come towards the tower to collect them but once Bosinas was within range of their guns they killed him.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> In retaliation his army, shot at the tower with their cannons and blew it up.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref>

The Egyptians then proceeded towards the town of Polytsaravos and reached it on [[28 August]].<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> The inhabitants of the town had sent the women and children to take refuge in the mountains before improving the fortifications they had there.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> The inhabitants of the town were reinforced by other Maniots and soon the defenders numbered 2,500 men.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> The Egyptians had trouble advancing to Polytsaravos because of the fact that it was surrounded by rocky ground which was situated on high ground.<ref name="Barrow102">Barrow, ''The Mani", 102</ref> As soon as the Arabs arrived the Maniots sallied from the fortifications and attacked the Arabs.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> The Arabs retreated from Polytsaravos after sustaining 400 casualties while the Maniots only suffered nine.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> This was the last invasion of Mani by the Egyptians or the Ottomans as the Peloponnese, Central Greece and some of the island were liberated in 1828 after the naval forces [[Bourbon Restoration]] France under [[Henri de Rigny]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under [[Edward Codrington]], and the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Login Geiden]] defeated Ibrahim at the [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] in 1827.

===Republic and Regency===

[[Image:Otto_of_Greece.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[King Otto]], the first King of Greece.]]

In 1831, [[Ioannis Capodistrias]] became governor of Greece.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> Capodistrias quarreled with the Mavromichalis because the Maniots refused to pay taxes to the government.<ref name="Paroulakis165">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 165</ref> Capodistrias requested that [[Tzanis Mavromichalis|Tzanis]], Petros' brother go to [[Nauplio]], then capital of Greece and negotiate.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref> As soon as Tzanis arrived he was arrested and imprisoned. Capodistrias then sent soldiers to Mani and had Petros arrested, imprisoned and charged with [[high treason]].<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref> His brother Konstantinos, the defender of Nauplio and Petros' son, [[Georgios Mavromichalis]], were put under house arrest in the capital.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref>

On [[27 September]] ([[Julian calendar]])/[[October 9]] ([[Gregorian calendar]]) [[1831]], Capodistrias went to attend a church service at the [[Church of St Spyridon]].<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref> He noticed that Konstantinos and Georgios were waiting at the church doors.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref> As he passed them he briefly stopped before proceeding into the church. As he was about to step into the church, Konstantinos fired his gun and the bullet hit Capodistrias at the back of the head while at the same time Georgios stabbed him through the heart.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref> Capodistrias collapsed into his attendants arms. Capodistrias' one armed bodyguard shot Konstantinos as he has running. Konstantinos was hit by several more bullets before he died.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref> His body was then dragged by an angry mob who thrown it into the sea.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref> Georgios was captured and executed on the island of [[Bourzi]], a little off the shore of Nauplio while his father looked on.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref>

In 1833, [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]], a son of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, became King of Greece after he was appointed by the [[Great Powers]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 58</ref> Since he was underage he had a Council of Regency headed by [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]] governing the country for him.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 58</ref> One of the Council's first acts was to try and subdue the unruly Maniots and pull down their towers while another was to free Petros and Tzanis from their prisons.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos35">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 35</ref> The council sent an army of Bavarians to Messa Mani with the goal of taming Mani.<ref name="Kassis43">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 43</ref> They made it to Areopoli but during the night, the Maniots surrounded and captured them, forcing them to leave Mani.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref>

On [[14 May]], [[1834]], four companies of Bavarians troops assisted by four cannons laid siege to the town of [[Petrovouni]].<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> 800 Maniots from the surrounding towns attacked the Bavarians.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> The Bavarians were massacred as most of them were either slain by the Maniots or fell into a ravine near the town while escaping.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> Later that year, an army of 6,000 men with five cannons under the command of General [[Schmaltz]] assisted by five squadrons of royalist-Maniots once again besieged Petrovouni.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> When news of an army of 1,000 Maniots was approaching, they retreated to Gytheio.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref>

The Council decided that they could not subdue the Maniots by force, so they decided to sent a diplomat, [[Max Feder]], with the intentions of subduing Mani.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> He went to different Maniot family and offered them position if they supported the king.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> Many of the achamnomeri and some megalogenites were convinced by his offers and agreed.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> However, several of the older families and the poorer anchamnomeri rejected the offer because the former did not want to be dependent on a king and the latter because they did not want governors with superior rights.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> In [[Kitta]], this division caused blood shed when the king's supporters started fighting the other group under the command of [[Giorgaros Skylakakis]].<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> Feder soon arrived with his new allies and blew up Skylakakis and all his allies in his towers. Thus was Mani finally subdued.<ref name="Kassis45">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 45</ref>

===Late 19th century===

During Otto's rule, plenty of blood was spilt in Mani because of the [[vendetta]]s which had plagued it for centuries.<ref name="Kassis45">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 45</ref> The vendettas continued until 1870, when the last Maniot vendetta took a regular army with artillery to stop.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos36">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 36</ref>

In 1841, [[Crete]] revolted against the Ottomans. The Maniots who are described as ''cousins'' of the Cretans rushed to Crete to support their ''cousins''.<ref name="Kassis45">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 45</ref> The Cretans together with the Maniots forced the Turks into their fortress were they besieged them. A combined Ottoman-English fleet managed to subdue the Cretans and make the Maniots go back to Mani. In 1866, a new revolution sparked in Crete and 2,000 Maniots under the command of [[Petropoulakis]] went and assisted their ''cousins''.<ref name="Kassis45">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 45</ref> However, the Cretans were defeated and the Maniots were again forced to retreat to Mani.<ref name="Kassis45">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 45</ref>

===20th century===

At the start of the 20th century, Greece was involved with the [[Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Macedonian Struggle]], military conflicts against the [[VMRO|Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and the Turkish forces in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupied [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Many volunteers from Mani took part in the war.<ref name="Kassis46">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 46</ref> The Maniots also took part in the series of wars that followed including the [[Balkan Wars]], [[World War I]] and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]].<ref name="Kassis46">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 46</ref>

During [[World War II]], the Maniot contributed a lot to the [[Hellenic Army]].<ref name="Kassis46">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 46</ref> Amongst the Greek leaders during the [[Battle of Greece]], was a Maniot, Colonel [[Konstantinos Davakis]].<ref name="Kassis46">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 46</ref> Davakis in command of the Pindus Detachment, defeated the Italians at the [[Battle of Pindus]] ([[28 October]] - [[13 November]], [[1940]]) despite the Italians having better machinery and weapons.

Later, the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]] defeated the [[Regia Marina]] of Italy in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] ([[27 March]] - [[29 March]], [[1941]]) on Cape [[Tenaro]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 141</ref>

However, [[Nazi Germany]] attacked Greece in order to support the Italians. They were allied and both were among the [[Axis powers of World War II]]. The Greeks were forced to retreat and soon Mani received its forgotten role as center of refugees.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 141</ref> In April 1941, the British started evacuating their troops from Porto Kagio.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 141</ref> By the end of that month, Mani and the rest of Greece, were in Italian and German hands, at the beginning of the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 141</ref>

The Germans and Italians were forced out of Greece in 1944 but as soon as they left the [[Greek Civil War]] began. The armies of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], [[ELAS]] and [[DSE]] fought against the Hellenic Army and the royalists.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos38">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 38</ref> Mani never recovered from both wars and soon the younger people of Mani left for [[Athens]], the [[United States]] and [[Australia]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos39">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 39</ref>

Now Mani is divided into two [[nomos]], [[Laconia]] and [[Messenia]]. Mani has around 18,000 inhabitants with the most important and populous town being [[Gytheio]]. Mani's main source of income is tourism. The most famous of the tourist attractions are the [[Caves of Diro]], which are two caves that have underwater rivers flowing through them.

===Dances===

An other part of Maniot culture as well as other parts of Greece is dancing. Two dances come from Mani: Palio Maniatiko (Greek:Old Maniot) and the Modern Maniatiko. The Palio Maniatiko is only found in Mani and it is described as an ancient dance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mani.org.au/dancegroup/dgDanceTypes.asp |title=Types of Dances

===Piracy===

Part of the Maniot culture was [[piracy]]. The Maniots were famed and feared pirates and the Maniot pirate ships dominated the Maniot coastline.<ref name="Barrow16">Barrow, ''The Mani", 16</ref> The Maniots became pirates because of the fact that Mani was not a very fertile land and the Maniots did not have many natural resources.<ref name="Barrow16">Barrow, ''The Mani", 16</ref> The Maniots considered piracy as a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor and it became their main sources of income.<ref name="Barrow16">Barrow, ''The Mani", 16</ref> The pirate raids were not stopped by the local priests of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] who in fact blessed the ships before they left and sometimes accompanied them on raids. Most of the Maniots pirates came from Messa Mani.<ref name="Barrow17>Barrow, ''The Mani", 17</ref> The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans but the Maniots also targeted ships of from the powerful European countries.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 38</ref>

===Superstition===

The Maniots are also a very superstitious people.<ref name="Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani", 18</ref> The Maniots mainly believed in [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[demon]]s, [[vampire]]s and [[ghost]]s.<ref name="Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani", 18</ref> When [[Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon]] was touring Mani in 1839, he found a fresh egg by the side of the road and offered it to a Maniot soldier who escorted him, who declined the offer claiming that if a [[hag]] had enchanted it he would have to marry her.<ref name="Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani", 18</ref> The Maniots thought that certain areas were haunted by demons.<ref name="Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani", 18</ref>

===Vendettas===

Another important aspect of Maniot culture were the [[vendetta]]s which frequently plagued it. Usually the decision to start a vendetta was made at a family gathering at cold blood. The main aim of a vendetta was usually to wipe out the other family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta

Some vendettas went on for months and sometimes years. In vendettas the families could have a truce or ''treva'', if one family needed to attend a religious ceremony or when it was time to harvest the crops. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta

=Ethnology=

The inhabitants of Mani consider themselves as direct descendants of the ancient Spartans.<ref name="Hall, Hellander, Simcock and Willet263">,Hall, Hellander, Simcock and Willet ''Lonely Planet: Greece", 263</ref> After the Romans took over Laconia, many of the citizens that were loyal to the laws of [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]], decided to flee to the mountains of Mani rather than be in Achean or later Roman service.<ref name="Hall, Hellander, Simcock and Willet263">,Hall, Hellander, Simcock and Willet ''Lonely Planet: Greece", 263</ref> Even though it seems highly unlike, Kassis claims that Maniots rarely mated with non-Maniots until the 20th century.<ref name="Kassis20">,Kassis ''Mani's History", 20</ref>

Mani began it's role as a refuge during the 4th century AD when the [[barbarian invasions]] started in Europe. When the Avars and Slavs invaded the Peloponnese invaded the Peloponnese, they failed to infiltrate Mani which caused many refugees from the rest of the Peloponnese to flee to Mani.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref> Constantine Porphyrogenitus states in his book that the Maniots were not conquered or intermixed the Slavs in his book by stating: ''Be it known that the inhabitants of Castle Maina are not from the race of aforesaid Slavs but from the older Romaioi, who up to the present time are termed Hellenes...''<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref>

There were recording of interbreeding between Maniots and non-Maniots in the medieval period. When the Nikliani came to Mani, they married native Maniots and some blend in with the natives.<ref name="Kassis24>,Kassis ''Mani's History", 24</ref> With the Ottoman invasion of the Byzantine Empire, Mani received a mass influx of immigrant that soon founded whole non-Maniot towns.

Even though the Maniots claim they are direct descendants from the Spartans, it is highly doubtful that they are as with the mass influx of refugees over the centuries, the Maniots would have been forced to breed with the refugees.<ref name="Kassis20">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 20</ref>

{{cnote|Social castes of Mani|In the second Byzantine occupation of Mani, there were four social castes, the Nikliani, the Megalogenites, the Achamnomeri and the Fameyi. The Nikliani were the inhabitants of the town of Nikli before it was sacked by the Byzantine emperor, [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]]. Kyriakos Kassis claims that the Nikliani were a family<ref name="Kassis24">Kassis, "Mani's History", 24</ref> while Patrick Leigh Fermor claims they were the inhabitants of Nykli.<ref name="Fermor86">Fermor, ''Mani: Travels into the Southern Peloponnese", 86</ref> The Nykliani were wealthy, upper class people who started the building of pyrgoi in Mani<ref name="Kassis24">Kassis, "Mani's History", 24</ref>. 


The Megalogenites (Greek:Big Births), were refugees from other parts of Greece who were from wealthy and reknown families like the Commenoi, Palaeologoi, Medici and others.<ref name="Kassis24">Kassis, "Mani's History", 24</ref> They mostly ignored the Nikliani's laws or tried to live in harmony with them.<ref name="Kassis24">Kassis, "Mani's History", 24</ref> The Megalogenites also started building towers like the ones built by the Nikliani.<ref name="Kassis24">Kassis, "Mani's History", 24</ref>


The Achamnormeri were the third Maniot class and was the middle class.<ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref> It did not have as many rights as the first two class. They had the right to build only one storey towers and they were not allowed to build it out of limestone or marble.<ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref> They owned most of the fields and had a right to a portion of common property like quail, salt and fish.<ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref> They also had the freedom of movement and means of production. If during the night, they managed to raise a tower larger than one of their neighbors they were considered more powerful.<ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref>


The last caste were the Fameyi who were serfs. <ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref>They had not property and they sometimes confused by modern historians as Achamnormeri.<ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref> They were low quantity and they could be emancipated and became Achamnormeri.<ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref>

{{cnote|Population of Mani|In 1453, Mani's population grew drasticly as a lot of refugees arrived from other parts of Greece, after the [[Fall of Constantinople]].<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref> Around that time towns like Skoutari were founded by people who had escaped from Constaninople.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos54">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 54</ref> Kassis tells us that the population of Mani at that time was between 40,000 and 80,000.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref>

Count Chateau-Reneau says that at the begining of the 17th century there were 700 cities and many villages in Mani which is thought to be an exaggerated number.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref> In 1700, 14,773 people were recorded in the census despite the constant migrations in Mani.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref> In 1805, Colonel William Leake records that there were 30,000 people living in Mani.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref> Twelve years later, K. Koumas writes in his geography's that Mani had 100,000 inhabitants which was a wildly exaggerated number.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref> In 1820, Anagnostras composition for the [[Philiki Eteria]] says that Mani had 8,000 fighting men.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref> Kassis comes to the conclusion that Mani had around 45,000 inhabitants in 1820.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref>

{{cnote|Refugees|As a result of the many revolts against the Ottoman Empire, the Maniots welcomed new Greek refugees from various areas including [[Asia Minor]], and especially Crete when the Turks acquired the island from the Venetians in 1669.<ref name="Fermor150">Fermor, ''Mani: Travels into the Southern Peloponnese", 150</ref> The Cretan refugees settled in Mani and created villages with Cretan names that enriched the Maniot dialect with Cretan words and idioms.<ref name="Fermor150">Fermor, ''Mani: Travels into the Southern Peloponnese", 150</ref>

The mass migration of refugees caused new problems in Mani. The limited area of good arable land led to many local wars between families, clans, and different villages. The era of [[vendetta]] began in Mani and it seemed that only a new Ottoman invasion could save the country from a civil war. Many Maniot people began to serve as mercenaries in the army of the [[Doge of Venice]] while some others became pirates to fulfill their patriotic duties. In fact, the Ottoman fleet near [[Chania]], Crete was destroyed by Maniot pirates.<ref name="Kassis32">Kassis, "Mani's History", 32</ref>}}

{{cnote|Immigration from Mani|Between 1600 and 1700, there were mass exodus of Maniots leaving Mani for European countries. In 1570, some Maniots immigrated to [[Voltera]].<ref name="Kassis27">Kassis, "Mani's History", 27</ref> As seen above the 700 Stephanopoulos' migrated to Corcisa as well as the Iatrini, (who latinized name happened to be Medici) who went to live in Tuscany after gaining [[Ferdinand Medici]]'s promission.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos27">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 27</ref> There still towers in Tuscany that look the Maniot ones.<ref name="Kassis28">Kassis, "Mani's History", 28</ref> The Duke of Genoa wanted some Maniots to colonize the western Italian coast as to protect it from pirates and the poeration ended in success.<ref name="Kassis28">Kassis, "Mani's History", 28</ref> There are mentions of a lot of Maniots in Naples and T. Asanis Palaeologus building a church there.<ref name="Kassis28">Kassis, "Mani's History", 28</ref> There are also tombs of Palaeologi in [[Cornwell]], [[England]] as well as one in [[Westminister]] of a Palaeologus who fought with [[Oliver Cromwell]].<ref name="Kassis28">Kassis, "Mani's History", 28</ref> [[Charles V]], the [[King of Spain]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] had distinguished army corp name the ''Mainoti''.<ref name="Kassis28">Kassis, "Mani's History", 28</ref>
