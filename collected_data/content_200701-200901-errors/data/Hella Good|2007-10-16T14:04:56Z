==Background and writing==
No Doubt decided to work with [[hip hop production]] duo The Neptunes as a sort of "cultural collision".<ref>Grant, Kieran.

Having toured in the Bay Area, Stefani borrowed the term to describe her mood.<ref name="video">"Hella Good".  ''[[Making the Video]]''.  [[MTV]].

The song's music video was directed by [[Mark Romanek]].  Not following any plot, the video depicts the band as a group of [[punk rock]]ers [[squatting]] in an abandoned ship.

There are also sequences of people riding on [[personal water craft]]s, Stefani performing on a coiled rope, people playing ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]'', and Stefani broadcasting on a [[pirate radio]] station.<ref name="video"/>

Romanek came up with the video's concept it and e-mailed it to the band.  He based it off of a black-and-white Italian ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' fashion shoot from the mid 1990s which featured models on waverunners.  The video was then filmed over three days in March 2002 in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]].
