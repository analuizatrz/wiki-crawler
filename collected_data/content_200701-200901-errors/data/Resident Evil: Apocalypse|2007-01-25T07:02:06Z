'''''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''''' (formerly titled '''''Resident Evil: Nemesis''''') is a science-fiction action film, the [[sequel]] to the [[2002]] film ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]''. The film is written by [[Paul W. S. Anderson|Paul Anderson]] and is directed by [[Alexander Witt]]. The film, which stars [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Oded Fehr]], [[Sienna Guillory]] and [[Mike Epps]], was released in [[North America]] on [[September 10]], [[2004]] and [[October 21]], [[2004]] in [[Australia]]. The film grossed [[USD|$]]51,201,453 domestically and $129,394,835 worldwide.<ref name="boxofficemojo">http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=residentevilapocalypse.htm</ref> A third movie in the [[tetralogy]] is set for release on [[September 7]], [[2007]] titled ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]''.

Unlike the first film, which was an original story that only borrowed elements from the games, ''Apocalypse'' is loosely based on the third game in the series, ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', and borrows some of its characters.


==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}

=== Re-opening of The Hive ===
[[Image:Trailer 09.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Re-opening of [[The Hive (Resident Evil)|The Hive]].]]
At the end of the [[Resident Evil (film)|first movie]], a [[Biological hazard|biohazard]] team re-opens [[The Hive (Resident Evil)|The Hive]], a secret research facility developed by the [[Umbrella Corporation]] containing its biological research projects, including those for [[biological warfare]]. The team is overrun by monstrous creatures and zombies. This forces Umbrella to quickly evacuate their important personnel and families from the city above, fearing that the city will be overrun by the creatures. During this evacuation [[Angela Ashford]], daughter of prominent Umbrella scientist [[Dr. Charles Ashford]], is stranded in the city after her evacuation vehicle was involved in a car accident. The carnage reaches the streets of the metropolis of [[Raccoon City]] thirteen hours later. An agent for a SWAT team, called the S.T.A.R.S., [[Jill Valentine]] ([[Sienna Guillory]]), heads to the Raccoon City Police Department, which she finds swarming with zombies, whom the police officers are trying to restrain, assuming they are merely insane murderers.

=== Evacuation ===
During the evacuation, Umbrella screens the people for contamination before they are allowed to leave the city. When the infection reaches the screening point, Umbrella executive [[Major Timothy Cain]] shuts the gates, thus trapping many people in the city with the zombies and authorises his troops to use deadly force to disperse the enraged trapped crowd.

[[Image:Raccooncityresapoc.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Raccoon City]] prior to the [[T-Virus]] outbreak (also the skyline of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]).]]
Meanwhile, [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] ([[Milla Jovovich]]), a former Umbrella Security Operative, wakes up inside an Umbrella lab in the deserted Raccoon City hospital to find destruction and chaos in the streets. Jill teams up with fellow cop [[Peyton Wells]] and news reporter [[Terri Morales]] to try and find another way out. After being trapped in a church by infected creatures they are rescued by Alice and group together in order to find a way out.

=== City of the Dead ===
Dr. Ashford remains in the camp outside Raccoon City to try and track down his daughter. He offers Alice and her team a way out if they can get his daughter out safely. Ashford reveals that Umbrella plans to "sanitize" the city with a nuclear device at sunrise, as a way of hiding their biological warfare experiments.

[[Carlos Oliveria]] ([[Oded Fehr]]), a [[mercenary|hired gun]] for Umbrella, is abandoned by Umbrella deep inside Raccoon City. Carlos and other survivors from Umbrella's mercenary team also get a call from Ashford proposing the same deal offered to Alice's team. S.T.A.R.S. team agents fight off a huge bio-weapon, engineered by Umbrella, a nine-foot tall humanoid called the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]]. Umbrella orders Nemesis to kill all of the S.T.A.R.S. team members, an order he promptly follows. After Jill's colleague Payton is killed by Nemesis, Alice decides to take on the creature. Jill and Terri pick up another survivor, [[L.J. (Resident Evil)|L.J.]], and together they proceed to search the school for Angela. Subsequently, Terri is killed by zombie children.

=== An Escape Route ===
Carlos (who is the only one of his team to survive) meets up with Angela, Alice, Jill and L.J.. Alice explains how the T-Virus creates zombies as a horrific side effect but she has been enhanced by being infected as part of Umbrella's experiments, and reveals the existence of the antidote. Ashford directs them to a helicopter at the City Hall and states that they will need to take it by force. They proceed to the location and quickly find themselves surrounded by Umbrella guards. Cain has discovered that Dr. Ashford has been helping the survivors and has also taken him prisoner. Shooting Dr. Ashford, Cain forces Alice to fight Nemesis as an experiment or he will kill the other prisoners. Alice impales Nemesis - only to come to realize it was her friend, [[Matt Addison]] ([[Eric Mabius]]). The Nemesis turns on Umbrella's forces and helps the survivors to retake the helicopter but is destroyed in the battle. The survivors (Alice, Jill, Carlos, Angie, and L.J.) push Cain out of the helicopter as it takes off, and he is attacked by the zombies swarming the City Hall, including the resurrected Dr. Ashford.

=== Revival/Extinction ===
As predicted, a nuclear missile explodes in Raccoon city to "sanitise" the area. The shockwave causes the helicopter to crash in the [[Arklay Mountains]], where an Umbrella team later finds Alice's dead body.

[[Image:Alice rebirth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alice is revived after her death by Umbrella.]]
Several weeks later, Alice is revived in a lab. She fights her way out, discovering her new powers, including, perhaps, telekinesis.  Jill and Carlos, masquerading as Umbrella operatives, whisk Alice away.  At the security gate, [[Dr. Sam Isaacs]] informs his assistant to activate "Program Alice". Alice's eyes flash the Umbrella corporate logo as she leaves the Umbrella facility. The film ends with panning out of Alice's eye and into the [[exosphere]] revealing a satellite with the Umbrella logo on it.

==Critics' response==
The film was well received at the Box Office, earning just under $300,000,000.

''Apocalypse'' did however receive negative reactions from the critics. The film appears only 40% fresh on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (22 out of 112 reviews are counted fresh).<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_apocalypse/</ref> Tim Cogshell from the ''Box Office Magazine'' stated that ''Apocalypse'' is ''"superior to the original film."'' Robert Dominguez, from ''[[New York Daily News]]'' stated that the film ''"should please the target audience."'' Walter Chaw from ''Film Freak Central'' states that ''Apocalypse'' is ''"An excellent sequel to an excellent film."''

The films success has spawned 2 sequels, one currently in production titled ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction|Extinction]]'' and an untitled fourth installment.{{fact}} The film has also received a weighted average<ref>http://www.imdb.com/ratings_explained</ref> rating of 5.7/10 on [[Internet Movie Database|IMDB]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318627/ratings</ref>

Film critic Victoria Alexander (from FilmsInReview.com) said “If you like tough chicks killing zombies, RE:A is for you,” although she nonetheless noted that “Screenwriter Paul W.S. Anderson doesn’t bog down the film with philosophical subtext or explain the zombies,” which she acknowledges are probably not “questions ...suitable for the demographics targeted.” .. Alice is in a class of female action heroes all her own.<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_apocalypse/</ref>

Critic Sean Axmaker gave the film a grade of C+, and said that the director’s “ headlong pace that favors action over spectacle... helps distract from all but the most contrived and absurd turns of Anderson's slapdash script.” Critic Dragan Antulovbigger gave the film 5/10. He noted the more spectacular setting (made possible by the bigger budget than the initial film), “deadlier weapons...[an] increased number of explosions[, and an] increased bodycount.” He said that despite the “shallowness of the content” there was “interesting production design and energetic direction.”<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>

Reviewer Roger Ebert gave the film one half of a star, calling it an “utterly meaningless waste of time”, “a dead zone, a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects.”  Chris Alexander of Rue Morgue Magazine said that “RE2 is a dreary, incoherent mess of a movie, failing on almost every conceivable level and having the dubious distinction of rendering hordes of shambling, screaming cannibalistic zombies boring.” Alexander stated that the director “Witt can’t stage an action sequence,” said that the lead actress “looks bored,” called the score “useless” and said that the “effects are more like defects.”<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>

Film critic Rob Blackwelder called  "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" “inept, unoriginal, [and] asinine”, and stated that it is “on the Worst of 2004 list.” Blackwelder criticized the film as a
a “braindead disaster” with “pathetic” “leaden mindlessness,” with “impossibly stupid and nonsensical plot defects.” He stated that the film was “...overflowing with off-the-shelf action-hack staples” and “tiresome stereotypes,” and directed with a lack of “narrative or cinematic sense.”<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>

Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central, who gave the film 1/2 stars out of four), criticized the “shoddiness of the make-up” and the lack of “critical biographical/geographical details.” He states that the editing seems like it was “ edited with a weed whacker.” Chaw notes that “an entire sequence” was “lifted whole from La Femme Nikita.” While Chaw admits to loving genre films, he states that films like this “lowe[r] the conversation even lower than it already is.” In all, Chaw says “no artistry[–] it ain't good.” Reviewer Anthony Del Valle calls the film “yawn of the dead,” and laments “how little the writer develops the idea, and how the director turns his back on every opportunity to creatively exploit the situation.<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>

==Production==
[[Image:Resident evil city hall.jpg|thumb|right|Filming at Toronto City Hall.]]
''Apocalypse'' was [[greenlit]] in [[2002]] when the first [[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil film]] was a success at the [[box office]]. The film was produced by Constantin Film, Davis Film and Impact Pictures, mostly on location in [[Canada]]. The film entered [[pre-production ]] stages in mid [[2003]] and began [[principal photography]] on [[August 6]], [[2003]] and ended on [[October 23]], [[2003]]. The majority of the movie was filmed in Ontario, Canada; Toronto's City Hall was used as [[Raccoon City]] Hall, and [[Exhibition Place]] (namely the National Trade Centre) was used as Umbrella's worldwide headquarters.

=== Filming Locations ===
* [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]
* [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]
* [[Toronto City Hall|City Hall]], [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada
* [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Ontario, Canada
* [[Hamilton Cemetery]], Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
* [[Prince Edward Viaduct]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada
* [[Bloor Collegiate Institute]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada
* [[Northern Secondary School]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada

===Box Office Figures and Ratings===
The film grossed[[United States dollar|$]]23,036,273 on its opening weekend ([[September 10]]-[[September 12|12]] [[2004]]). The film gained $51,201,453 domestically and $129,394,835  worldwide.<ref name="boxofficemojo"/> 

The film's classifications were as follows: US = R;Britain = 15; Canada = 14A; Germany = 18; Australia = M; New_Zealand = R-13; Singapore = NC-16; Brazil = 16; Denmark = 15; Finland = K-15; France = 12; Hong_Kong = IIB ;Malaysia = 18SG; Mexico = B-15; Norway = 15; Portugal = 12; Peru = 14; Argentina = 13;Greece = 15+; and Venezuela = B-12.

===Regenerate===
[[Image:Resident2 02.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Regenerate.]]   
The ''Regenerate'' "commercial" was a teaser trailer for the second ''Resident Evil'' movie, and can be seen in the movie on a [[TV]] screen in the female scientist's house. It is reminiscent of the [[Olay]] product ''Regenerist'' advertisements.    

'''[[Regenerate (Resident Evil)|Regenerate]]''' ''(2003)'' is a skin care product (and registered trademark) of the Umbrella Corporation (motto: Our business is life itself), using the T-Virus to reanimate dead cells and make you more youthful looking. Some side effects may occur (dying... but not staying dead). 

The [[teaser trailer ]] is available from Sony Pictures in both RealMedia<ref>http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/video/trailer/trailer_low.ram</ref> and Windows Media formats.<ref>http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/video/trailer/trailer_low.asx</ref>

===Miscellaneous Information===
{{toomuchtrivia}}
*It is believed that Major Cain was inspired by the character of [[Max (24 Character)|Max]], from the second season of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] hit drama ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', also portrayed by [[Thomas Kretschmann]]{{fact}}. 
* The film's director [[Alexander Witt]] has a cameo in the film as the sniper on top of Raccoon City Hall.
*[[Ben Moody]], former lead guitarist of the alternative rock band [[Evanescence]], makes a brief cameo appearance as a zombie in the film, which is mentioned in the DVD audio commentary.  
* [[Paul W.S. Anderson]] wrote and directed the first ''Resident Evil'' movie but only wrote the screenplay for ''Apocalypse'', passing the director's chair to [[Alexander Witt]] so he could direct ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.
* Just as in the first movie, actors playing zombies were trained at a zombie "[[boot camp]]." Actors were coached to act as zen-zombies (a creature that relentlessly follows its target) and ''liquid'' zombies. Anderson and other crew members were tempted to make the zombies move faster but decided that it would be breaking with a fundamental element of the games.
*The word "zombie" is never mentioned, following the example of the first movie.
* The Nemesis was an actor in a suit, Matthew G. Taylor, with only  special-effects applied to certain parts of the characters body (such as the eye of the creature). Despite Taylor being 2.01 metres in height he was still considered too short, to hide this the character wears large boots and in many scenes the Nemesis was stretched to appear taller.
* The same dog-team was used in the second film for the zombie-dogs as in the first. The look of the [[Dobermann|dog]]s was achieved through a combination of make-up and computer-effects. 
* The monsters "lickers" completely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] in the sequel, though the use of an animatronic model was considered. Unlike in the first film the development of the lickers began at an early stage of production so that the creatures would be fully ready when it was time to shoot the scenes in the church. 
* Two more sequels are planned: ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 4 (film)|Resident Evil 4]]''.
* The movie cost $11 million more than the original ''Resident Evil''
* A longer cut of the movie exists in Germany available to buy on DVD. This version reinstates most of the deleted scenes that were on the DVD. It is unknown if this is planned to be released in the rest of Europe and the US.
* An ad similar to the Regenerate can be seen in ending credits. The ad states that the film is "a product of the Umbrella Corporation." It ends with "Some Side Effects may occur."

[[Image:Arklaymountainsfromapocalypse.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Arklay Mountains]] overlooking [[Raccoon City]].]]
====Introduction Scenes====
* ''Apocalypse'' re-enacts certain scenes from the games (particularly the intro scenes):
:* The car crash scene that leaves Angela Asford stuck in Raccoon City is reminiscent to the intro of ''Resident Evil 2.''
:* The scene where Alice runs through the building with an Umbrella helicopter firing at her, up to the point where she drops her gun, falls, re-grabs it and fires, is reminiscent to the intro scene of ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica]]'' in which [[Claire Redfield]] acts accordingly.
:* The scene in which [[Raccoon City]] is being overrun by zombies, and the police and [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]] mercenaries are fighting back, up to the point in which a zombie reflects off a fallen police helmet, is reminiscent to the intro scene of ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.'' The launching of the missile to complete sanitation is also a scene similar to that of one in the game.

====[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]====
* The crash site of the helicopter is located in the [[Arklay Forrest]] near the Arklay Mountains, where the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series first began.
* In the abandoned church and school, Jill moves and points the gun the exact same way she does in the game.
* Terri's death is identical to Joseph's death (''RE1'' remake) which is also recorded, though the latter was mauled by the zombie dogs, not children.
* A white goddess statue can be seen in the church. Artwork of goddesses has a large role within the puzzles in the ''Resident Evil'' series.
*On the ''Arklay Overpass'', Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' is, of course, an adaptation of a series of "sick games" and the fixed camera perspective in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective.

====[[Resident Evil 2]]====
* Alice's visit to the gun shop at the start of ''Apocalypse'' is a reference to ''Resident Evil 2'', where one of the leading characters takes shelter in a gun shop.
* The character Angela Ashford may be a concept borrowed from [[Sherry Birkin]], as they are both children, dressed in school uniforms, in need of rescue. Both of their fathers are also researchers working for Umbrella. The Ashford name, however, comes from the founders of Umbrella revealed in ''Resident Evil : Code Veronica''.

====[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]====
* Jill wears the same outfit from ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]''.
* Like his video game counterpart, Nemesis only speaks one word ("S.T.A.R.S."). Unlike his video game counterpart, he only speaks this line once whereas in the game, Nemesis speaks this line during every encounter.
* The graveyard scene is a reference to the ''Resident Evil Remake'', ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', and ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica'', where zombies also pop out of their graves.
* The scene in which a zombie's head is reflected in a Raccoon City Police Department Motorcycle helmet, is a reference to a similar scene in this game's opening cut scene.
* The nuclear weapon approach and explosion is a shot-for-shot recreation of the equivalent scene in the videogame's finale.

==Game and Movie Differences==
{{spoilers}}
{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|- bgcolor="#CCCCCC"
! Movie !! Games
|- 
| Jill was suspended from [[S.T.A.R.S.]] after events unknown. They are never explained. It is explained in the novelization that Jill was suspended due to her report on zombies in the forest.
| Jill resigns from S.T.A.R.S. after all attempts to expose the events at the mansion are ignored or blocked by [[Raccoon Police Department|R.P.D.]] Chief Brian Irons (who subsequently disbanded the unit), on [[William Birkin]]'s payroll. She resigns to investigate [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]]'s doings in [[Raccoon City]] full time.
|- 
| [[Raccoon City]] is nuked by Umbrella in an effort to cover up the outbreak. With [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]]'s marketing and economic muscle, they are able to manipulate the media into reporting that a "nuclear power plant melted down and destroyed the entire city" (despite the impossibility of a meltdown causing a nuclear explosion).
|The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] orders a nuclear missile strike on Raccoon City after a group of Tyrants defeated elements of the armed forces in a battle near an abandoned factory on the outskirts of the town (the aftermath of this battle can be seen in ''Resident Evil 3''). Despite the political maneuvering of Umbrella, who wanted to study the effects of the city-wide infection, the strike is initiated. Later on in ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', it is known that the US government suspended the activities of Umbrella.
|-
|The [[T-Virus]] can be used for medical applications. It helped Angie to walk.
|The only application of the T-Virus is to create bioweapons. There is no positive effect of the T-Virus and it has only been used for [[biological weapon]]ry.
|-
|Lickers are created by injecting the T-Virus directly into living tissue. When they taste fresh blood, they mutate.
|Lickers are created when people infected by the T-Virus are exposed to a second dose. These creatures are accidental and were created due to the circumstances of the outbreak. They do not mutate after tasting blood. According to the novels from SD Perry, William and Annette Birkin created the Re3 (licker), as stated when Annette waited in the surveillance room waiting for her mutated husband to enter the detonation zone. 
|-
|[[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] is killed after defending Alice from gunfire.
|Nemesis is killed after being dodged by Jill for a majority of the outbreak. After a series of battles, the Nemesis is reduced to a nebulous blob finally put to rest by two shots from the "Paracelsus Sword" weapon, a fixed magnetic coil gun brought in by US armed forces to fight off a squad of Tyrants.
|-
|Nemesis does not have tentacles, but does have a Gatling Gun and Rocket Launcher.
|Nemesis uses his T-Virus infected tentacles to attack enemies as well as a Rocket Launcher. S.T.A.R.S. member [[Brad Vickers]] was killed with his tentacles, and later resumed animation as a zombie (only to be killed by either [[Leon S. Kennedy]] or [[Claire Redfield]]).
|-
|The outbreak in Raccoon occurred as a result of Umbrella researchers re-opening the Hive, a research facility packed to the gills with dangerous viral monsters. The city is infected within hours.
|The outbreak occurs as a combination of monsters left over from the mansion incident and an assassination attempt on William Birkin for his G-Virus sample. As the assassin escaped with his work, he injects himself with the G-Virus and wreaks havoc. In the process, the T-Virus is spilled and the rodent population in the sewer are infected, slowly spreading the virus to the citizens. The city is infected in less than a week.
|-
|The T-Virus is said to cause uncontrolled mutation.
|The G-Virus is the only virus that mutates uncontrollably and it cannot be passed by bites, but according to Anette Birkin (William Birkin's wife) "it is able to revitalize cellular functions". It requires direct inoculation or embryos implanted on a genetically compatible host. However in ''Resident Evil 2'' the T-Virus is described as "a mutagenic toxin", and even though most of its victims turn into zombies, other creatures such as the lickers, the Tyrant and (possibly) Nemesis, giant spiders, mutated sharks, and oversized lampreys are products of infection. No positive effects of the T-virus have been observed in the games.
|-
|The Umbrella Corporation publicly flaunts their wealth and power. They funded the construction of Raccoon City and have great power worldwide.
|The Umbrella Corporation is a powerful company, yet they deal mostly in secret. Though their contributions have led to the development of Raccoon City, they do not flaunt their international power openly. To the public, they've known as a simple medical/health corporation, akin to [[Pfizer]].
|-
|Nemesis was created as part of the "Nemesis Program", a project to create the ultimate bioweapon. It was created in [[the USA|America]]. It was unleashed by Umbrella within Raccoon City to test its abilities such as wiping out S.T.A.R.S.
|The Nemesis was an experimental bio-weapon created by the European branch by implanting a new kind of parasitic  organism into an ordinary mass-produced [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]. In the first game it is revealed that the real reason for S.T.A.R.S involvement in the mansion incident was Albert Wesker's intention to test the bioweapons against "realistic targets" (armed, trained paramilitaries/military personnel). Nemesis takes time to train and perfect, since they are programmed to hunt specific targets. In ''Resident Evil 3'', its mission was to hunt down and kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. due to their involvement in the "Mansion Incident."
|-
|Jill, [[Carlos Oliveira|Carlos]], Angie, and L.J. free Alice from Umbrella headquarters after the Raccoon City nuking.
|Jill and Carlos escape from Raccoon (with or without Barry's help, depending on the ending). Where they head is unknown, but it seems they still intend to meet up with [[Chris Redfield]] in [[Europe]].
|-
|Nicholai was a heroic, somewhat naive mercenary, eventually killed by two [[zombie]] dogs in the movie.
|[[Nicholai Ginovaef|Nicholai]] is a double crossing, secret Umbrella agent, who is either killed by Nemesis, escapes in a helicopter or is shot down in a helicopter by Jill depending on the player's choices throughout the game. 
|-
|Nemesis is computer-controlled and can be programmed with commands remotely from a laptop.
|Nemesis is autonomous, and follows his pre-set commands to wipe out S.T.A.R.S.
|-
|The S.T.A.R.S. team consists of at least 25 operatives during the Raccoon City incident. Members include [[Jill Valentine]], Peyton Wells, Commander Ryan Henderson and other unnamed characters. [[Chris Redfield|Chris]] and [[Barry Burton|Barry]] (and other character from the games besides Jill) are nowhere to be seen.
|The S.T.A.R.S. team first consists of 12 members (excluding pilot Kevin Dooley), divided into two separate teams which were [[S.T.A.R.S.#Alpha Team|Alpha]] and [[S.T.A.R.S.#Bravo Team|Bravo]]. During their [[investigation]]s of the Mansion incident, most of the team was killed off and reduced to 5 members when they escaped (without taking [[Albert Wesker|Wesker's]] revival into account). During the events of ''Resident Evil 3'', however, Brad Vickers, the pilot of Alpha Team, is killed by Nemesis in front of the R.P.D. Precinct.  S.T.A.R.S. was disbanded by Chief Irons after the Arklay Mountain incident and the armed elite officers fighting the zombies were actually members of the newly created [[Raccoon Police Department#Select Police Force|Select Police Force]].

The film's DVD release in [[Germany]] has an exclusive "Extended Edition", that reinstates most of the Deleted Scenes from the DVD and also, but not limited to. 

=== Extended Scenes===
* An extended scene before Jill, Peyton and Terri enter the church, Terri whispers to Jill "What's going on? They were shooting on people. Innocent people, why didn't you do something? You are the police aren't you?" Jill ignores her, the scene continues as normal, but audio is a bit different in places.

* A shot that was in the trailer where the camera spins around a gargoyle on top of the church, and a flash of lightning reveals a Licker, thrashing its tongue around.

* A shot of Alice pulling a shard of glass out of her leg after Jill demands "Who the fuck are you?" and limping away.

* After L.J. runs over the undead, he sees 2 topless prostitutes, and crashes his car. In the Extended Version, L.J. says something along the lines of "You're still looking good, baby. I'll still spend 5 dollars on you!" before crashing. This scene was in the [[novelization]] by [[Keith R.A. DeCandido]].

* After L.J. drops his guns before the Nemesis, he shouts abuse at him and dances whilst clicking his fingers and singing. Some of these shots are in the outtakes reel. 

* Finally, an exchange between Jill and Alice when they are walking past the phone boxes, where Alice asks "What are you staring at?" Jill responds "I'm not sure, what made you want to work for Umbrella?" from a wide angle, Alice says "A girls' gotta make a living." Jill laughs.  This scene is featured in the deleted scenes for the U.S. version of the DVD.
