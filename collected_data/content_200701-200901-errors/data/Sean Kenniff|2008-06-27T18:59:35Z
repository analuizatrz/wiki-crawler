'''Dr. Sean Kenniff''' (born [[27 November]] [[1969]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] who appeared on the first series of the television show ''Survivor'' (later called ''[[Survivor: Borneo]]''), filmed and broadcast in [[2000]]. 

Kenniff was born in [[Massapequa, New York]]; his father was a [[firefighter]]. He graduated from [[Massapequa High School]] and received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in biology at [[Binghamton University]] in [[1991]]. He received an M.D. at [[New York Medical College]] in [[1995]], and did a three year residency followed by a year as Chief Resident in [[neurology]] at [[Long Island Jewish Medical Center]], which is affiliated with [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]].

He was the twelfth of sixteen contestants to be eliminated and was dubbed "The Alphabet Killer" for his famous "Alphabet Voting" strategy, in which he cast his votes based on the order of contestants' names in the alphabet.[http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?article=article3691.art&page=2] He later claimed that he chose the system as a way to vote off members of the opposing Pagong tribe, (whose names were all earlier alphabetically than his own tribe) while appearing to do so in a non-deliberate manner.

He has said that he wants to be a writer; after appearing on ''Survivor'' he has made acting appearances on ''[[The Guiding Light]]'' and has appeared as a medical [[correspondent]] on various [[news]] programs. He currently is on the news staff of the television station [[WFOR-TV]], a [[CBS]] affiliate in [[Miami, Florida]]. He is also a [[radio syndication|syndicated]] radio columnist for [[Winstar]] Radio (his "Survivor Minute" is heard on 200 stations worldwide), and he contributes a weekly health column to the [[Miami Herald]].
