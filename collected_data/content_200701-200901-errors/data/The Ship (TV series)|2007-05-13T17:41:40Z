'''''The Ship''''' is a documentary film of a 21st-century voluntary crew on a six-week journey from the east coast of [[Australia]] to [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] aboard a replica of [[Captain James Cook]]'s Endeavour. The 55 men and women on board - among them the director, producer & cameraman [[Chris Terrill]] - came from several different countries and nationalities. The crew traced Cook's footsteps from one historical landmark to another. All of the volunteers lived and worked as 18th century sailors, but were not required to wear period costumes. "The Ship" had some modern conveniences: a satellite phone for emergencies, and a flush toilet in the lower deck for use while sailing in the Great Barrier Reef.

In October, 2002, the History Channel in conjunction with the BBC aired its "history adventure reality series". It consisted of 6 episodes with each episode running approximately 60 minutes.
