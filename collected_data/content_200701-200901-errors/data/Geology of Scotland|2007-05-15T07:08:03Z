[[Scotland]] has an incomparable variety of [[geology]] for a country of its size. It is also the origin of many significant discoveries and important figures in the development of the science.

The oldest rocks of Scotland are the [[Lewisian gneiss]]es, which were laid down in the [[Precambrian]] period, up to 3,000 Ma ([[Mega-annum]]) ago. They are among the oldest rocks in the world. During the Precambrian, the [[Torridonian sandstone]]s and the [[Moine]] were also laid down. Further [[sedimentary]] deposits were formed through the [[Cambrian]] period, some of which [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] into the [[Dalradian]] series. The area which would become Scotland was at this time close to the south pole.

During the [[Silurian]] period (439-409 Ma), the area which became Scotland was part of the continent of [[Laurentia]]. Across the [[Iapetus Ocean|Iapetus]] ocean to the south, was the continent of [[Baltica]]. The two continents gradually collided, joining Scotland to the area which would become England and Europe. This event is known as the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian Orogeny]], and the [[Highland Boundary Fault]] marks this stitching together of continents. Silurian rocks form the [[Southern Uplands]] of Scotland, which was pushed up from the sea bed during the collision. The highlands were also pushed up as a result of this collision, and may have been as high as the modern day [[Alps]] at this time. The [[Old Red Sandstone]]s were laid down in low lying areas during this period. [[Volcano|Volcanic activity]] occurred across Scotland as a result of the collision of the [[tectonic plate]]s, with [[volcano]]es in southern Scotland, and [[magma chamber]]s in the north, which today form the [[granite]] mountains such as the [[Cairngorms]].

During the [[Carboniferous]] period (363-290 Ma), Scotland lay close to the equator. Several changes in sea level occurred during this time. The [[coal]] deposits of [[Lanarkshire]], and further sedimentary deposits, date from this time. More volcanic activity formed [[Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh|Arthur's Seat]] in [[Edinburgh]], among other hills. By the [[Triassic]], Scotland was a desert, the origin of large [[sandstone]]  outcrops of the south west. Although large deposits of [[Cretaceous]] rocks would have been laid down over Scotland, these have not survived erosion, as have the [[chalk]]s of England. 

By the [[Tertiary]] period, the tectonic plates were again moving, separating into modern day [[North America]] and Europe with the creation of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The split occurred to the west of Scotland, leaving a chain of former volcanic sites through the [[Hebrides]], including [[Isle of Skye|Skye]] and [[St Kilda, Scotland|St. Kilda]]. This was the last period of rock formation in Scotland. Since then, several [[ice age]]s have shaped the land through glacial erosion, creating [[Glaciated valley|u-shaped valley]]s and depositing [[boulder clay]]s. About half of the [[coastline]] of Scotland consists of [[Machair (geography)|Machair]] [[habitat]],<ref>[http://www.wildlifehebrides.com/environment/machair/ Machair Profile]</ref>  a low lying dune pasture land formed as the sea level dropped leaving a raised beach. In the present day, Scotland continues to move slowly north.
