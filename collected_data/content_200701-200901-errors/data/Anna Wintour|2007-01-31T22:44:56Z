'''Anna Wintour''' (born [[November 3]], [[1949]]) is the [[Editing|Editor]]-in-Chief of the [[U.S.]] edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', a position she has held since 1988. 

==Family==

Her father, [[Charles Vere Wintour]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], was a former editor of The ''[[Evening Standard]]''. Her mother was Wintour's first wife, Eleanor ("Nonie") Trego Baker, the daughter of a [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law professor]], whom he [[marriage|married]] in 1940 and [[divorce]]d in 1979. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna (Gilkyson) Baker, a [[Philadelphia]] socialite.<ref name="Oppenheimer2">Oppenheimer, Jerry;''Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor In Chief'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 2005, ISBN 0-3123-231-07, 2</ref> Her stepmother is Audrey Slaughter, a magazine editor who founded such British publications as ''Honey'' and ''Petticoat''.

Wintour had four siblings, three of whom survive: James Charles, the [[managing director]] of [[Gravesham]] Borough Council<ref name="Gravesham">Gravesham Borough Council; 20 August 2004; [http://www.gravesham.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1173 Council’s Top Job is Filled]; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref>; Nora Hilary Wintour, who is the deputy general secretary of [[Public Services International]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]][http://www.world-psi.org/TemplateEn.cfm?Section=PSI_staff&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=13041]; [[Patrick Wintour|Patrick Walter]], who started as labour correspondent at ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1983 and rose to become the political editor for both it and the ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2006,<ref name="Patrick Wintour"> [http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardiancontacts/page/0,,326716,00.html Patrick Wintour, chief political correspondent]; ''[[The Guardian]]''; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref> Her eldest brother, Gerald Jackson Wintour, died as a child in 1951 when he was struck by a car.<ref name="Oppenheimer28">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', 28</ref>

Her [[aunt]] Cordelia Wintour married [[Eric James, Baron James of Rusholme|Sir Eric James]], who was granted a [[life peer]]age as Baron James of [[Rusholme]].

==Early life==

The young Wintour was educated at [[North London Collegiate School]], where she frequently rebelled against the [[dress code]] by wearing her [[skirt]]s so that the [[hem]] was higher than allowed.<ref name="Oppenheimer15">Oppenheimer, ''op.cit.'', 15</ref>. At the age of 14 she began wearing her hair in the [[bob cut|bob]] that has since become her trademark. As London began to [[Swinging London|swing]], she became a dedicated follower of fashion, in the form of [[Cathy McGowan]]'s television show, and her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market. In her later teens, she began dating [[gossip columnist]] [[Nigel Dempster]] and became a fixture on the London club circuit with him.<ref name="Oppenheimer36-37">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', 36-37.</ref>

==Career==
[[Image:Anna Wintour by David Shankbone edited-1.jpg|thumb|Wintour, behind [[André Leon Talley]], center]]
At 16, Anna dropped out of North London Collegiate. Wintour chose not to go to college but instead entered a training program at [[Harrods]]. At her parents' behest, she also took some fashion classes at a nearby school, but soon dropped out, telling her friend Vivienne Lasky that "you either know fashion or you don't".<ref name="Oppenheimer51">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', 51.</ref> At Harrod's, she continued dating well-connected older men, in this case Peter Gitterman, the stepson of [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] conductor [[Georg Solti]].

She entered the field of fashion journalism in 1970 when ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' merged with ''Queen'' to become, for a time, ''Harper's & Queen''. There, she discovered model [[Annabel Hodin]], a former North London classmate, and used the connections she had built up to secure locations for some striking, innovative shoots.<ref name="Oppenheimer81">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', 81.</ref> One recreated the works of [[Renoir]] and [[Manet]] using models in [[go-go boots]].<ref name="Met bio">[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; January 12, 1999; [http://www.metmuseum.org/Press_Room/full_release.asp?prid={44C504B8-C28F-11D3-936E-00902786BF44} Anna Wintour elected honorary trustee]; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref> After a short stint at a small magazine named ''[[Savvy]]'',<ref name="Larson">Larson, Christina; April 2005; [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0504.larson2.html From Venus To Minerva]; ''[[Washington Monthly]]''; retrieved December 11, 2006.</ref> Wintour would move on to become a junior fashion editor at [[Harper's Bazaar]] in New York in 1975,<ref name="Met bio" /> where she lasted less than a year before being fired.{{citation needed}} Anna went on to become editor in charge of fashion at ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]''.<ref name="Larson" /> According to Jerry Oppenheimer's biography ''Front Row'', she would later omit mention of the magazine in her career because of its connections to ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. After three years, she moved on to become fashion editor of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.<ref name="Met bio" /> 

She became editor of ''British Vogue'' in [[1986]] and ''[[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]]'' the following year. At the former, she told her father's old paper, the ''Evening Standard'', she wanted to reach "a new kind of woman out there. She's interested in business and money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how." <ref name="Larson" /> 

At the latter, she was so fond of putting couture in photo spreads that industry wags began to refer to the magazine as ''House & Garment''.<ref name="Slate">Fortini, Amanda; February 10, 2005; [http://www.slate.com/id/2113278/ Defending ''Vogue'''s evil genius]; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref>  She managed to turn around and increase circulation of ''British Vogue'' but her couture photo spreads turned off [[Subscription business model|subscribers]] to ''House & Garden'' such that it would eventually close down after she left (later, it would be revived by its parent company,[[Conde Nast]]). 

She was expected to do the same at American ''Vogue'', when she took over in 1988. It had, under her predecessor [[Grace Mirabella]], become more focused on lifestyles as a whole and less on fashion.<ref name="Slate" /> Industry insiders worried that it was losing ground to the upstart ''[[ELLE]]''<ref name="Slate" />, which had been introduced to America from France in 1985.<ref name="Larson" /> Wintour made her mark early on with a shift in the cover pictures. Whereas Mirabella had preferred tight [[Head shot|headshots]] of well-known models, Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, in [[natural light]], instead of the [[studio]], echoing what Vreeland had done years earlier.<ref name="Larson" /> She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with the high fashion — the first issue she was in charge of, in November of that year, featured a young [[Israel]]i model in a $50 pair of faded [[jeans]] and a bejeweled [[T-shirt]] by [[Christian Lacroix]] worth 200 times that (200 x $50 = $10,000). Eight months later, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a [[terrycloth]] [[bathrobe]] and apparently without [[makeup]].<ref name="Slate" /> She also made a point of seeing to it that photographers, [[makeup]] artists and [[hairstylist]]s got as much credit for the images as the models.<ref name="Larson" />

Under her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under [[Diana Vreeland]]. The September 2004 issue boasted a record 832 pages, the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time.<ref name="Slate" /> She has also overseen the introduction of three spinoff titles: ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', ''[[Vogue Living]]'' and ''[[Men's Vogue]]''.  Her accomplishment at expanding the brand [[Vogue]] earned her the coveted title of "Editor of the Year," by the industry trade magazine AdAge.  

Anna Wintour, through the years, has become one of the most powerful women in fashion, setting trends and anointing new designers - [[The Guardian]] has called her the "unofficial mayoress" of [[New York City]].<ref name="Unofficial mayoress">Pilkington, Ed; 5 December 2006; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1964329,00.html Central Bark]; ''The Guardian''; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref>  At the same time, Wintour is an avid champion of the fashion industry. She has played a great part in the success stories of the designers [[John Galliano]] (of [[Christian Dior]]) and [[Michael Kors]], and her protégée at ''Vogue'', [[Plum Sykes]], became a successful [[novel]]ist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.

Her salary is reported to be $5 million a year and she also receives generous perks including a $50,000 clothes budget, a [[chauffeur]] and a suite at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] whilst attending Paris Fashion Week.{{fact}}

==Personal life==



===Marriages and children===

She [[marriage|married]] child psychiatrist [[David Shaffer]] in 1984<ref name="Larson" /> and has two children by him, Charles (Charlie) and Katherine (known as Bee). The couple [[divorce]]d in 1999; [[tabloid]] newspapers and gossip columnists speculated that it was an affair with [[millionaire]] [[investor]] [[Shelby Bryan]] that ended the marriage, but Wintour has refused to comment.{{fact}}

===Philanthropy=== 

Despite her infamous icy facade, Wintour is also a noted [[philanthropist]]. She serves as a [[trustee]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.<ref name="Met bio" /> Wintour began the CFDA/Vogue Fund in order to encourage, support and mentor unknown fashion designers. She has also raised over $10 million for [[AIDS]] charities since 1990, by organizing various high profile benefits.<ref name="Met bio" />

==Criticism==

While her success at turning ''Vogue'' around and her support of the fashion industry and charity work are universally acknowledged, many observers have also criticized Wintour. Most criticism tends to center on accounts of her personality. She has often been described as a [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] who routinely makes impossible, arbitrary demands of those who work for or under her and treats them unkindly ... "kitchen scissors at work", in the words of one commentator.<ref name="Slate" /> She reportedly once made a junior staffer look through a photographer's [[garbage|trash]] to find a picture he had refused to give her.<ref name="Larson" /> In 2003, her former assistant, [[Lauren Weisberger]], published the [[bestseller|bestselling]] ''[[roman à clef]]'' ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', whose [[antagonist]] [[Miranda Priestly]] was widely believed to be based on Wintour. 

She is also believed to exert great control over her public image. When she took over as ''Vogue'' editor, gossip columnist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] reported rumors that she had gotten the job by having an [[affair]] with Conde Nast [[chairman]] [[Si Newhouse]]. Wintour was reportedly furious and made her anger the subject of one of her first staff meetings.<ref name="Larson" />

In 2005, Wintour was the subject of an unauthorized [[biography]] by [[Jerry Oppenheimer]], ''Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor In Chief'', that drew on many unnamed sources, often with grudges, to paint a similar portrait of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but directed others not to cooperate.<ref name="Oppenheimerxi">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', xi</ref>

That image has lent support to accusations that she has imposed a similarly [[elitism|elitist]] aesthetic on the magazine, making demands that even prominent subjects change their image before being featured in its pages. The [[animal rights]] group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) made her a central target of its anti-[[fur clothing|fur]] campaign.

Critics of Wintour's management style also point to a May 11, 2004 ruling by a New York court in a case brought against Wintour and Shaffer by the state [[Workers' Compensation]] Board. It sought to recover $140,000 in costs it had incurred when a former employee of the couple who had been injured on the job turned out not to have had the necessary [[insurance]] coverage. Wintour and Shaffer repeatedly failed to make payment, forcing the suit. The two were ordered to pay $104,403; an additional $32,639 was levied against Wintour herself.<ref name="TSG">Bastone, William; May 18, 2004; [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0518043anna1.html Wintour In $140,000 Worker's Comp Default]; ''[[The Smoking Gun]]''; retrieved December 10, 2006.</ref>

===''The Devil Wears Prada''===

Weisberger's novel is told in the voice of Andrea "Andy" Sachs, a young woman fresh from college with literary ambitions who knows little about fashion when she starts a year at ''Runway'' magazine, working as the junior assistant to legendary editor [[Miranda Priestly]], who among her [[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)#Realism|other similarities]] to Wintour is British, has two young children and serves on the Met's board. Priestly is depicted as a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their failures to do so.<ref name="novel cite">Weisberger, Lauren; ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', Broadway Books, New York 2003, ISBN 0-7679-1476-7, 145</ref> Similar charges have long been made about Wintour herself by (usually unnamed) former employees. Prior to its publication, Wintour told the ''[[New York Times]]'', "I always enjoy a great piece of fiction. I haven't decided whether I am going to read it or not."<ref name="Times quote">Carr, David; February 17, 2003; [http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/17/business/media/17MAG.html?8hpib=&pagewanted=all&position=top Anna Wintour Steps Toward Fashion's New Democracy]; ''[[The New York Times]]''; retrieved December 10, 2006.</ref>

While it has been suggested that the setting and Priestly were based on ''Vogue'' and Wintour, Weisberger denies this, and even gives Wintour herself a cameo appearance near the end of the book. Yet it is almost universally believed that the book's success was due to the real-life angle. Neither ''Vogue'' nor any other Conde Nast publications, nor many other popular women's magazines, reviewed Weisberger's book. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed the book, and it identified Wintour as Weisberger's onetime superior and ''Vogue'' as her place of employment. Conde Nast publication ''[[The New Yorker]]'' also identified Wintour and ''Vogue'' in their review of the film [http://www.newyorker.com/critics/cinema/articles/060710crci_cinema].

During production of the movie in 2005, Wintour was reportedly pressuring prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, not to make [[cameo appearance]]s in the movie lest they be banished from the magazine's pages, at least temporarily.<ref name="Radar">{{cite web|url=http://www.radarmagazine.com/fresh-intelligence/2005/11/09/index.php#report_004079|title=The Devil You Know, On Line One|accessdate=2006-07-01|work=Fresh Intelligence|date=2005-11-09}}</ref> She denied it through a spokesperson who said she was interested in anything that "supports fashion". But, while many designers are mentioned in the film, only one, [[Valentino Garavani]], actually appeared as himself.<ref name="Radar" />

In mid-2006, [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|the film version]] was released to great commercial success. Wintour attended the [[premiere]] wearing [[Prada]]. In the film, actress [[Meryl Streep]] plays a Priestly different enough from the book's to receive critical praise as an entirely original (and more sympathetic) character (although Streep's office in the film bears some striking similarities to Wintour's<ref name="office photos">See photos of both at [http://www.oficinadeestilo.com.br/blog/wp-content/office.jpg this page], retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref>). Streep denies that her portrayal was based on Wintour, whom the actress says she only met at the first benefit screening of the film. She stated she had no interest in doing a documentary on the ''Vogue'' editor, preferring to draw her inspiration from an amalgam of überbosses she had met over the years. Later that year, in an interview with [[Barbara Walters]] which aired the same day the film's [[DVD]] was released, Wintour said she found the film "really entertaining" and praised it for making fashion "entertaining and glamorous and interesting.... I was one hundred percent behind it".<ref name="Barbara Walters">Walters, Barbara; December 12, 2006; [http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2716887&page=3 Anna Wintour: Always in Vogue]; "The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006"; retrieved from abcnews.go.com December 18, 2006.</ref>

While Wintour may have borne no malice toward the film and those involved in it, the same may not be true regarding Weisberger. When ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' [[gossip columnist]] [[Lloyd Grove]] reported shortly before the film's release that the author was having enough trouble with her third novel (after disappointing sales of her second, ''Everyone Worth Knowing'') that her editor suggested she completely start over, there was enough [[bitterness]] left that Wintour's spokesman Patrick O'Connell suggested she "should get a job as someone else's assistant."<ref name="Lloyd Grove">Grove, Lloyd; May 2, 2006; [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/413881p-349908c.html Author goes from Prada to nada]; ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]''; retrieved May 2, 2006.</ref>
[[Image:PETA anti-Anna Wintour pic.jpg|240px|left|thumb|Anti-Wintour image created and distributed by PETA to protest her continued promotion of fur in fashion.]]

===PETA campaign===

She has often been the target of various [[animal rights]] organizations such as [[PETA]] who are angered by her use of fur in Vogue, her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid advertisements from animal rights organizations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads. She is routinely assaulted by activists over this matter. 

In Paris in [[October 2005]], she was hit with a [[tofu]] pie while waiting to get into the [[Chloé]] show.<ref name="USA Today">[[Associated Press]]; October 2005; [http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-10-10-vogue-wintour_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA Anti-fur demonstrators hit 'Vogue' editor with a pie in Paris] ''[[USA Today]]''; retrieved December 8, 2006.</ref> She herself said she has been physically attacked so many times she's "lost count."{{fact}} She and ''Vogue'''s publisher Bob Galotti once retaliated for a protest outside the Conde Nast offices during the company's annual [[Christmas]] party by sending down a plate of steaming, freshly cooked [[roast beef]].<ref name="Page Six">Johnson, Richard; December 19, 1997; [http://www.voguesucks.com/artwint6.gif Vogue fights PETA beef with beef]; [[Page Six]], ''[[The New York Post]]''; retrieved from voguesucks.com December 8, 2006.</ref>

===Elitism===

Some critics have charged that instead of models, celebrities are becoming the face of ''Vogue''.{{fact}} Indeed, a wide range of prominent women have graced the front cover of Vogue during Wintour's tenure, from Oscar-winning actresses ([[Nicole Kidman]], [[Charlize Theron]], and [[Angelina Jolie]]) to celebrities ([[Melania Trump]] and [[Kate Winslet]]) and politicians ([[Hillary Clinton]]).

According to insiders, however, she has not been content to let celebrities appear on the cover, but has demanded they bow to her standards as well. [[Oprah Winfrey]] was reportedly told she would not be photographed for the cover until she lost weight, and Clinton would not appear until she stopped wearing navy blue [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s as much as she had been.<ref name="Slate" />.  Another writer for the magazine complained that Wintour excluded ordinary working women, many of whom are regular subscribers, from the pages. "She's obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader," the writer says." "We once had a piece about [[breast cancer]] which started with an [[flight attendant|airline stewardess]], but she wouldn't have a stewardess in the magazine so we had to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who'd had cancer."<ref name="Slate" />

===Responses===

Wintour has rarely, if ever, personally responded to criticisms of her, as most critics have been her employees or others with something to gain by remaining in her favor. But there have been a few defenses from other quarters. Amanda Fortini at ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' said she was just fine with Wintour's elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion and, ultimately, good for the magazine's readers:
{{quote|In a sea of women's glossies that purport to be about fashion but publish earnest articles chronicling the author's quest for self-actualization, ''Vogue'' stands apart. The voluminous fashion pages are arty, original, and sophisticated, shot by talented photographers like [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Irving Penn]], and [[Steven Meisel]]. Most of us read ''Vogue'' not with the intention of buying the wildly expensive clothes, but because doing so educates our eye and hones our taste, similar to the way eating gourmet food refines the [[palate]]. This is a pleasure enabled by Wintour's ruthless aesthetic, her refusal to participate in the democratizing tendency of most of her competitors. To deny her that privilege is to deny her readers the privilege of fantasy in the form of beautifully photographed [[Paris]] couture.<ref name="Slate" />}}

Responses to horror stories about her treatment of employees have frequently been met with charges of [[sexism]], that similar behavior from a male boss would seem unremarkable. "Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts", said the ''New York Times'' in a piece about Wintour shortly after the film's release.<ref name="Times Wintour film piece">Carr, David; July 10, 2006; "[http://plainsfeminist.blogspot.com/2006/07/devil-you-say.html The Devil Wears Teflon]"; ''The New York Times'', retrieved from plainsfeminist.blogspot.com December 10, 2006.</ref> Wintour has been likened to [[Martha Stewart]] and fellow Condé Nast editor [[Tina Brown]], both of whom also have been described as overbearing and abusive to those who work for them.

Some of her defenders have even seen her as [[feminism|feminist]] whose changes to ''Vogue'' have actually in a small way reflected, acknowledged and reinforced advances in the status of women. In a nominal review of Oppenheimer's book in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', [[managing editor]] Christina Larson notes that ''Vogue'', unlike many other women's magazines, doesn't play to its readership's sense of inadequacy:
{{quote|Unlike its glossy peers on the newsstand, it isn't loaded with tips to flatten your [[Human abdomen|abs]], flaunt your [[cleavage]], or squeeze into your thin jeans by Friday; it assumes you need no help mastering love moves no man can resist. It doesn't purport to solve problems, to help you feel less guilty. Instead, it reminds women to take satisfaction, parading all manner of fineries (clothes, furniture, travel destinations) that a successful woman might buy, or at least admire. While it surely exists to sell ads — which it does remarkably well — it does so primarily by exploiting ambition, not insecurity.<ref name="Larson" />}}
She contrasts Vreeland's Vogue with Wintour's by noting how the former treated female beauty as something innate, whereas Wintour showed how it could be created. "She shifted ''Vogue'''s focus from the cult of beauty to the cult of the creation of beauty ... Beyond whisking models off their pedestals, the concept that grace is a construction, and not merely a gift, allows that it can be enjoyed longer, well past the age of 40 or 50".<ref name="Larson" /> To her, the focus on celebrities is a welcome development as it means that women are making the cover of ''Vogue'' at least in part for what they have accomplished, not just how they look. "Wintour's ''Vogue'' allows women to imagine a world, increasingly an attainable one, in which the pursuit of beauty reinforces rather than overshadows female authority", she concludes.<ref name="Larson" />

Even ''The Devil Wears Prada'' is not without some admiration for Wintour/Priestly. Weisberger, through Andy, notes that she does manage the difficult task of making all the major editorial decisions in a major fashion magazine every month all by herself<ref name="novel cite1">Weisberger, ''op. cit.'', 208.</ref> and that she does have genuine class and style.<ref name="novel cite2">Weisberger, ''op. cit.'', 271-21.</ref>

==In popular culture==

*[[Edna Mode]], in the [[2004 in film|2004]] hit [[animation|animated]] film ''[[The Incredibles]]'', was believed to have been at least partially inspired by Wintour, due to the similar bob haircut.

*The HBO series ''[[Tracey Takes On]]'', starring [[Tracey Ullman]], also featured a similar Anna Wintour character.

*''[[Ugly Betty]]'''s character Fey Sommers shares some characteristics as Wintour, such as the bob and sunglasses.

* In his autobiographical comedy "How to Make Enemies and Alienate People", British journalist Toby Young nicknames Anna Wintour as "Nuclear Wintour" for her icy demeanour and alleged mood swings.

==  AEIF Documentary: the VOGUE September Issue ==

A&E [[IndieFilms]] and [[R.J. Cutler]] are to shoot a feature-length documentary chronicling the making of Vogue's September issue. Cutler had approached Wintour in 2004 and will direct the untitled pic which will be shot over eight months as Wintour prepares the fall fashion issue, known in the industry as the "fashion bible". The project is produced by [[AEIF]], the cable group's theatrical division.  The documentary will not be a straightforward profile of Wintour but rather a behind-the-scenes look at Vogue. AEIF plans to have the pic completed in 2008 in time to take out on the festival circuit.
