The '''Bennie Railplane''' was an early form of [[monorail]], invented by [[George Bennie]] (1891&ndash;1957), which moved along an overhead rail by way of [[propeller]]s. A prototype ran over a 130-[[yard]] line at [[Milngavie]] near [[Glasgow]] in the 1930s, but Bennie was never able to secure funding for further development and went bankrupt in [[1937]]. The line was demolished for scrap in the 1950s.
