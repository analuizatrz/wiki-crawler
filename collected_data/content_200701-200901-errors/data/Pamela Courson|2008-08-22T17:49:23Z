'''Pamela Susan Courson''' ([[December 22]], [[1946]] - [[April 25]], [[1974]]) was known as the long-term companion of [[Jim Morrison]], vocalist of [[The Doors]]. After the deaths of Morrison and Courson, her parents petitioned an out-of-state court to declare that the couple had a [[Common-law marriage|common law marriage]].

==Biography==
===Early life and involvement with Morrison===
Courson was born in [[Weed, California]]. She was described as a reclusive young girl from a family that didn't mix with the neighbors very much. She did well in school until junior high, when records show that her family was contacted about truancy. Courson hated high school, and her grades declined when she was sixteen. She did not return to [[Orange High School]] for her senior year, instead attending [[Capistrano High School]]. That spring, she left for Los Angeles, where she and a friend got an apartment. It has been rumored (and denied) that [[Neil Young]] wrote the song "Cinnamon Girl" about her.

One biography states that she and Morrison met at a nightclub on the [[Sunset Strip]] in 1965, while Courson was an art student at [[Los Angeles City College]]. In his 1998 [[memoir]], ''Light My Fire: My Life with the Doors'', former keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] stated that Courson and a friend saw the band during their stint at the [[London Fog]], a lesser-known nightclub, and that she was initially courted by [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]] of the Californian band [[Love (band)|Love]], who brought The Doors to the attention of [[Elektra Records]] boss Jack Holzman.

Morrison called Courson his "cosmic mate" and dedicated his self-published books of poetry to her, as well as songs such as "Love Street".{{Fact|date=June 2008}} Their relationship was tumultuous, with repeated sexual excursions by both partners. In an interview for the book ''Rock Wives'', [[Patricia Kennealy]] said of Courson: "I really did like her. She was nice. She wasn't an incredibly towering intellect, but she seemed very sweet and very pretty, very California".{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

Courson briefly operated Themis, a fashion boutique that Morrison bought for her.  Her death certificate lists her occupation as "women’s apparel."

===Deaths of Morrison and Courson===
On [[03 July]] [[1971]], Morrison was found dead by Courson in the bathtub of an apartment they were sharing in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. The official coroner's report listed his cause of death as [[heart failure]], although an [[autopsy]] was not performed. Questions persist over the actual cause of death. As per the stipulation in his will, which stated that he was "an unmarried person", Courson inherited his entire fortune. Lawsuits against the estate would tie up her quest for inheritance for the next two years. Courson did not remain in contact with the remaining Doors members after she received her share of Morrison's royalties. 

After Morrison's death, Courson became a recluse, using [[heroin]] and showing signs of [[mental illness|mental instability]]. On [[25 April]] [[1974]], Courson died of a heroin [[overdose]], on the living-room couch at the Los Angeles apartment she shared with two male friends. A neighbor said she had talked about looking forward to seeing Jim again soon. Her parents intended that she be buried next to Morrison at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, and they listed this location as the place of burial on her death certificate, but due to legal complications with transporting the body to France, her [[remains]] were buried at Fairhaven Memorial Park in [[Santa Ana, California]], under the name "Pamela Susan Morrison". After her death, her parents—Columbus and Penny Courson—inherited Morrison's fortune, but their executorship of the estate was later contested by Morrison's parents.

===Estate controversy===
In his will, made in Los Angeles County on [[12 February]] [[1969]], Morrison left his entire estate to Courson, also naming her co-executor with his attorney, Max Fink. 

When Courson died, a battle ensued between Morrison's and Courson's parents over who had legal claim to Morrison's estate. On his death, his property became Courson's; on her death, her property passed to her next heirs at law, her parents. Morrison's parents contested the will under which Courson and subsequently her parents had inherited their son’s property.

To bolster their positions, Courson’s parents presented a document that they claimed she had acquired in [[Colorado]], apparently an application for a declaration that she and Morrison had contracted a common-law marriage under the laws of that state. The ability to contract a common-law marriage was abolished in California in 1896, but the state's conflict-of-laws rules provided for recognition of common-law marriages lawfully contracted in foreign jurisdictions—and Colorado was one of the 11 U.S. jurisdictions that still recognized common-law marriage. As long as a common-law marriage was lawfully contracted under Colorado law, it was recognized as a marriage under California law.

Whatever the circumstances of the unsigned document and the court case, and controversy surrounding it, the California [[probate]] court decided that Courson and Morrison had a common-law marriage under the laws of Colorado. The effect of the court ruling was to close probate of Morrison's and Courson's estates and to reinforce the Courson family's hold on the inheritance.

==Fictional portrayals==
Courson was portrayed by [[Meg Ryan]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film, ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]''.
