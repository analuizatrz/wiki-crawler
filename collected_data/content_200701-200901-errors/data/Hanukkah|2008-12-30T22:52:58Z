'''Hanukkah''' ({{lang-he|חנוכה}}, {{IPA-all|'χanuka}}, alt. '''Chanukah'''), also known as the '''Festival of Lights''', is an eight-day [[Jewish holiday]] commemorating the rededication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] at the time of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] of the [[2nd century BCE]]. Hanukkah is observed for eight nights, starting on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] according to the [[Hebrew calendar]], and may occur from late November to late December on the [[Gregorian calendar]].

<!-- This paragraph is mostly duplicated below, but it seems to belong here in a summarised form -->
The festival is observed by the kindling of the lights of a special [[candelabrum]], the nine-branched ''[[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Menorah]]'' or ''Hanukiah'', one light on each night of the holiday, progressing to eight on the final night. An extra light called a ''[[Shamash#Shamash in Judaism|shamash]]'' ([[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]]: "guard" or "servant") is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher or lower than the others. The purpose of the extra light is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the [[Talmud]] (Tracate Shabbat 21b&ndash;23a), against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah story. (The shamash is used to light the other lights.) As such, if one were to read from the lights—something prohibited—then it's not clear whether the light one's reading from was from the Hanukkah lights or the shamash light. So the shamash acts as a safeguard from accidental transgression.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

Hanukkah is mentioned in the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] or [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha books]] of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]]. 1 Maccabees states: "For eight days they celebrated the rededication of the [[Altar#In the Hebrew Bible|altar]]. Then [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] and his brothers and the entire congregation of Israel decreed that the days of the rededication...should be observed... every year... for eight days. (1 Mac. 4:56-59)" According to 2 Maccabees, "the Jews celebrated joyfully for eight days as on the [[Sukkot|feast of Booths]]." -->

==Origins of the holiday==
"Hanukkah", from the Hebrew word for "dedication" or "consecration", marks the re-dedication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] after its desecration by the forces of [[Antiochus IV]] and commemorates the "miracle of the container of oil". According to the [[Talmud]], at the re-dedication following the victory of the [[Maccabees]] over the [[Seleucid Empire]], there was only enough consecrated [[olive oil]] to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days, which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate fresh olive oil.

Hanukkah is also mentioned in the [[deuterocanonical books]] of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]]. 1 Maccabees states: "For eight days they celebrated the rededication of the [[Altar#In the Hebrew Bible|altar]]. Then [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] and his brothers and the entire congregation of Israel decreed that the days of the rededication... should be observed... every year... for eight days. (1 Mac. 4:56&ndash;59)" According to 2 Maccabees, "the Jews celebrated joyfully for eight days as on the [[Sukkot|feast of Booths]]."

The martyrdom of Hannah and her seven sons has also been linked to Hanukkah. According to the Talmudic story<ref>Talmud Gittin 57b tells a story of a woman and her seven sons killed by "Caesar". The name "Hannah" is not stated.</ref> and [[2 Maccabees]], a Jewish woman named Hannah and her seven sons were tortured and executed by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus]] for refusing to worship an idol, which would have been a violation of [[613 Mitzvot|Jewish law]].

===Name===
The name "Hanukkah" derives from the Hebrew verb "חנך", meaning "to dedicate". On Hanukkah, the Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.<ref>See also [[Maharsha]] on [[Talmud]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 21b</ref> 

In the Jewish tradition, many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=11|title=Origin of the Name Chanukah|first=Nosson|last=Scherman|publisher=ArtScroll}}</ref> 
* The name can be broken down into "חנו", from the Hebrew word for encampment, and the Hebrew letters כ"ה, which stand for the 25th day of Kislev, the day on which the holiday begins: Hence, the Jews sat in their camp, that is, they rested fighting, on the 25th day of Kislev.<ref>[[Nissim of Gerona|Ran]] on [[Isaac Alfasi|Rif]] 9b</ref>
* Hanukkah is also the Hebrew [[acronym]] for "ח' נרות והלכה כבית הלל" meaning "eight candles as determined by [[Hillel the Elder|House of Hillel]]" This is a reference to the disagreement between two rabbinical schools of thought&ndash;Hillel and the [[Shammai|House of Shammai]]&ndash;on the proper way to light Hanukkah candles. Shammai said that eight candles should be lit from the start, and reduced by one candle every night, whereas Hillel argued in favor of starting with one candle and lighting an additional one every night. Jewish law adopted the position of Hillel.

== Historical sources ==
=== Mishna ===
{{see also2|[[Mishna#Omissions|Mishna Omissions]]}}

The story of Hanukkah, along with its laws and customs, is entirely missing from the [[Mishna]] outside of a single passing reference, ([[Megillah_(Talmud)|Megillah 3:6]]).<ref>A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice By Isaac Klein p.227</ref> [[Nissim Ben Jacob|Rav Nissim Gaon]] postulates in his Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud that information on the holiday is commonplace to the point that Rabbinical explanation is unnecessary. Reuvain Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, authors could not have included discussion of Hanukkah as the Roman occupiers would not have tolerated the overt nationalism inherent in the story.

=== In the Talmud ===
The miracle of Hanukkah is described in the [[Talmud]]. The [[Gemara]], in tractate ''Shabbat 2'' focuses on [[Shabbat]] candles and moves to Hanukkah candles and says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still [[seal (device)|seal]]ed by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, and miraculously, that oil burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready). <ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/shabbat2.html</ref>

The Talmud presents three options:
# The law requires only one light each night per household,
# A better practice is to light one light each night for each member of the household
# The most preferred practise is to vary the number of lights each night.
There was a dispute among the sages over how the last option was to be performed: either display eight lamps on the first night of the festival, and reduce the number on each successive night; or begin with one lamp the first night, increasing the number till the eighth night. The followers of [[Shammai]] favored the former custom; the followers of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] advocated the latter. As is the case in most such disputes, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] followed Hillel. Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door or in the window closest to the street. [[Rashi]], in a note to ''Shabbat 21b,'' says their purpose is to publicize the miracle.

===In the Septuagint and other sources===
The story of Hanukkah is alluded to in the book of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]] of the [[Septuagint]] but Hanukkah is not specially mentioned; rather, a story similar in character, and obviously older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees 1:18 ''et seq'' according to which the relighting of the altar fire by [[Nehemiah]] was due to a miracle which occurred on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabeus.

The Books of Maccabees are not part of the [[Tanakh]] ([[Hebrew Bible]]), but are part of [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] historical and religious material preserved in the [[Septuagint]]. The Tanakh ends with the consequences following the events of [[Purim]], and had already been codified many centuries earlier by the [[Great Assembly|Men of the Great Assembly]] (''Anshei Knesset HaGedolah'').

Another source is the [[Megillat Antiochus]]. This work (also known as "Megillat HaHasmonaim", or "Megillat Hanukkah") is in both [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the Hebrew version is a literal translation from the Aramaic original. Recent scholarship dates it to somewhere between the 2nd and 5th Centuries, probably in the 2nd Century,<ref>{{cite web|first=Benjamin|last=Zvieli|title=The Scroll of Antiochus|url= http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/miketz/zev.html| accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref> with the Hebrew dating to the seventh century.<ref name = "pvgsyw"> [http://customerservant.com/2006/12/16/the-scroll-of-the-hasmoneans/ The Scroll Of The Hasmoneans] </ref> It was published for the first time in [[Mantua]] in 1557. [[Saadia Gaon]], who translated it into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the 9th Century, ascribed it to the Maccabees themselves, disputed by some, since it gives dates as so many years before the destruction of the second temple in 70 CE.<ref> [http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/miketz/zev.html The Scroll of Antiochus] </ref> The Hebrew text with an English translation can be found in the [[Siddur]] of [[Philip Birnbaum]].

== The story ==
{{see also|Hasmonean}}
Around 200 [[BCE]] Jews lived as an autonomous people in the [[Land of Israel]], also referred to as [[Judea]], which at that time was controlled by the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] [[Seleucid dynasty|king of Syria]]. The Jewish people paid taxes to Syria and accepted its legal authority, and they were free to follow their own faith, maintain their own jobs, and engage in trade.

=== Traditional view ===
By 175 BCE [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] ascended to the Seleucid throne. At first little changed, but under his reign, the Temple in [[Jerusalem]] was looted, Jews were massacred, and [[Judaism]] was effectively outlawed. In 167 BCE Antiochus ordered an altar to [[Zeus]] erected in the Temple. As was the normal practice of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenic religion]] when sacrificing to the [[Greek gods]], [[pig]]s were sacrificed on the altar to Zeus.

Antiochus' actions proved to be a major miscalculation as they provoked a large-scale revolt. [[Mattathias]], a [[Kohen|Jewish priest]], and his five sons Jochanan, [[Simon Maccabaeus|Simeon]], [[Eleazar Maccabeus|Eleazar]], [[Jonathan Maccabaeus|Jonathan]], and [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] led a rebellion against Antiochus. Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi ("Judah the Hammer"). By 166 BCE Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 165 BCE the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated.
The festival of Hanukkah was instituted by [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]] and his brothers to celebrate this event.<ref>[http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/1MA/1MA4.HTM#59 1 Macc. iv. 59]</ref> After recovering Jerusalem and the Temple, Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made. According to the Talmud, olive oil was needed for the menorah in the Temple, which was required to burn throughout the night every night. But there was only enough oil to burn for one day, yet miraculously, it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of oil for the menorah. An eight day festival was declared by the Jewish sages to commemorate this miracle.

[[Image:Hanukkah2.jpg|thumb|right|Hanukkah lamp unearthed near [[Jerusalem]], c. 1900.]]
The version of the story in 1 Maccabees, on the other hand, states that an eight day celebration of songs and sacrifices was proclaimed upon rededication of the altar, and makes no mention of the miracle of the oil.<ref>[http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/1MA/1MA4.HTM#36 1 Macc. iv. 36]</ref> A number of historians believe that the reason for the eight day celebration was that the first Hanukkah was in effect a belated celebration of the festivals of [[Sukkot]] and [[Shemini Atzeret]].<ref>[http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/2MA/2MA10.HTM#6 Macc. x. 6] and [http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/2MA/2MA1.HTM#9 i. 9]</ref> During the war the Jews were not able to celebrate Sukkot/Shemini Atzeret properly; the combined festivals also last eight days, and the Sukkot festivities featured the lighting of lamps in the Temple (Suk.v. 2-4). The historian [[Josephus]]<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+12.287]
''Jewish Antiquities'' xii. 7, § 7, #323</ref> mentions the eight-day festival and its customs, but does not tell us the origin of the eight day lighting custom. Given that his audience was Hellenized Romans, perhaps his silence on the origin of the eight-day custom is due to its miraculous nature. In any event, he does report that lights were kindled in the household and the popular name of the festival was, therefore the "Festival of Lights" ("And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights").

It has also been noted that the number eight has special significance in Jewish theology, as representing transcendence and the Jewish People's special role in human history. Seven is the number of days of creation, that is, of completion of the material cosmos, and also of the classical planets. Eight, being one step beyond seven, represents the Infinite. Hence, the Eighth Day of the Assembly festival, mentioned above, is according to Jewish Law a festival for Jews only (unlike Sukkot, when all peoples were welcome in Jerusalem). Similarly, the rite of [[brit milah]] (circumcision), which brings a Jewish male into God's Covenant, is performed on the eighth day. Hence, Hanukkah's eight days (in celebration of monotheistic morality's victory over Hellenistic humanism) have great symbolic importance for practicing Jews.

=== Modern perception ===
Most modern scholars argue that the king was in fact intervening in an internal [[civil war]] between the traditionalist Jews in the country and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite book |title= Jewish Literacy: The Most Important Things to Know about the Jewish Religion, Its People, and Its History|last=Telushkin |first=Joseph |year= 1991|publisher= W.

Schultz:

<blockquote>
Modern scholarship on the other hand considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppresion than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp.<ref>{{cite book |title=Judaism and the Gentile Faiths: Comparative Studies in Religion |last=Schultz |first=Joseph P. |year= 1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |isbn= 0838617077|page= 155|quote=Modern scholarship on the other hand considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppresion than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the jewish camp}}</ref>
</blockquote>

These competed violently over who would be the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like [[Onias III|Onias]] contesting with hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]]. <ref>{{cite book |title= A Survey of the New Testament|last=Gundry |first=Robert H. |year=2003 |publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0310238250|page= 9}}</ref> In particular Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.<ref>{{cite book |title= Judaic Religion in the Second Temple Period: Belief and Practice from the Exile to Yavneh|last= Grabbe|first=Lester L. |year= 2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415212502 |page= 59}}</ref> Other authors point to possible socio/economic in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war. <ref>{{cite book |title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible |last=Freedman |first= David Noel|coauthors=Allen C. Myers, Astrid B. Beck|year=2000 |publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0802824005 |page= 837}}</ref>

What begun in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenizing Jews]] in their conflict with the traditionalists.
<ref>{{cite book |title=A Survey of Israel's History |last=Wood |first=Leon James |year= 1986|publisher= Zondervan|isbn= 031034770X|page=357 }}</ref> As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned the traditional religion of a whole people.<ref>Tchrikover, Victor. ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews''.</ref>

==Hanukkah rituals==
[[Image:Hanukkah1.jpg|thumb|right|Various menorot used for Hanukkah. 12th through 19th century, CE]]

Hanukkah is celebrated by a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the 8-day holiday. Some are family-based and others are communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals. Hanukkah is not a "Sabbath-like" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath]], as specified in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]''<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 670:1</ref> People go to work as usual, but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although, in Israel, schools close for the whole week of Hanukkah. Many families exchange gifts each night, and fried foods are eaten.

===Kindling the Hanukkah lights===
:{{seealso|Chanukkiyah}}
The primary ritual, according to [[Halakha|Jewish law and custom]], is to light a single light each night for eight nights. As a universally practiced "beautification" of the [[mitzvah]], the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 671:2</ref> An extra light called a ''shamash'', meaning ''guard'' or ''servant'' is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher or lower than the others. The purpose of the extra light is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud (Tracate Shabbat 21b&ndash;23a), against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah story. This differs from [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] candles which are meant to be used for illumination. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the ''shamash'' candle would be available and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some light the ''shamash'' candle first and then use it to light the others.<ref name = "lonorw">''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 673:1</ref> So all together, including the ''shamash'', two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the ''shamash'').

[[Image:Tiffany glasswork Hanukkah menora02.jpg|thumb|A modern [[Lead came and copper foil glasswork|Tiffany]] Hanukkah menorah]]
The lights can be candles or oil lamps.<ref name = "lonorw"/> Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room. Most Jewish homes have a special [[candelabrum]] or oil lamp holder for Hanukkah, which holds eight lights plus the additional ''shamash'' light.

The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the "lighting of the house within", but rather for the "illumination of the house without," so that passers-by should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle. Accordingly lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazim to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardim light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of [[Anti-Semitism|anti-semitic persecution]] were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in [[Iran|Persia]] under the rule of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups, light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the ''[[mezuzah]]'', so that when one passes through the door he is surrounded by the holiness of ''mitzvoth''.

[[Image:Maurice Ascalon Menorah Pal-Bell.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze [[Pal-Bell]] oil-burning Hanukkah menorah from Israel circa 1948, by [[Maurice Ascalon]].]]

===Time of lighting===
Hanukkah lights should burn for at least one half hour after it gets dark. The custom of the [[Vilna Gaon]] observed by many residents of Jerusalem as the custom of the city, is to light at sundown, although most Hassidim light later, even in Jerusalem. Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later, because they fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights. Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour, so on most days this requirement can be met by lighting the candles when it is dark outside. Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on the [[Shabbat]] itself, the candles must be lit before sunset. However, they must remain lit until the regular time&ndash;thirty minutes after nightfall&ndash;and inexpensive Hanukkah candles do not burn long enough to meet the requirement. A simple solution is to use longer candles, or the traditional oil lamps. In keeping with the above-stated prohibition, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first, followed by the Shabbat candles which signify its onset.

=== Blessings over the candles ===
[[Image:Skulen2.JPG|thumb|Grand Rabbi [[Israel Abraham Portugal]] of [[Skulen (Hasidic dynasty)|Skulen]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]] lighting Hanukkah lights]]
Typically three blessings (''Brachot'' singular ''Brachah'') are recited during this eight-day festival. On the first night of Hanukkah, Jews recite all three blessings; on all subsequent nights, they recite only the first two.<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 676:1-2</ref> The blessings are said before or after the candles are lit depending on tradition. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle, lamp, or electric) is lit on the right side of the Menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first candle and so on, proceeding from right to left over the eight nights. On each night, the leftmost candle is lit first, and lighting proceeds from left to right.

For the full text of the blessings, see [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Hanukkah|List of Jewish prayers and blessings: Hanukkah]].

==== ''Hanerot Halalu'' ====
During or after the lights are kindled the hymn ''Hanerot Halalu'' is recited. There are several differing versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 676:4</ref>

|-
|}

==== ''Maoz Tzur'' ====
{{main|Ma'oz Tzur}}
Each night after the lighting of the candles, while remaining within sight of the candles, Ashkenazim (and, in recent decades, some Sephardim and Mizrahim in Western countries) usually sing the hymn ''Ma'oz Tzur'' written in Medieval [[Germany]]. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in [[Jewish history]], and praises God for survival despite these tragedies ([[the exodus]] from Egypt, the [[Babylonian captivity]], the miracle of the holiday of [[Purim]], and the [[Hasmonean]] victory).

====Other customs====
After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing various other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Various Hasidic and Sefardic traditions have additional prayers that are recited both before and after lighting the Hanukkah lights. This includes the recitation of many Psalms, most notably Psalms 30, 67, and 91 (many Hasidim recite Psalm 91 seven times after lighting the lamps, as was taught by the [[Baal Shem Tov]]), as well as other prayers and hymns, each congregation according to its own custom. In North America it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time.

=== Additions to the daily prayers ===
{{quote box|align=left|width=45%|quote="We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name."|source=Translation of ''Al ha-Nissim''}}
An addition is made to the "''hoda'ah''" (thanksgiving) benediction in the [[Amidah]], called ''Al ha-Nissim'' ("On/about the Miracles").<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 682:1</ref> This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.

The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the ''[[Hallel]]'' Psalms are sung during each morning service and the ''[[Tachanun]]'' penitential prayers are omitted. The Torah is read every day in the [[synagogue]], the first day beginning from [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4.

Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbaths]] (Saturdays). The weekly [[Parsha|Torah portion]] for the first Sabbath is almost always ''[[Miketz]]'', telling of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s dream and his enslavement in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The ''[[Haftarah]]'' reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 2:14&ndash;4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the ''Haftarah'' reading is from [[I Kings]] 7:40&ndash;50.

The Hanukkah ''menorah'' is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings. The menorah is not lit on the Sabbath, but rather prior to the beginning of the Sabbath at night and not at all during the day.

During the [[Middle Ages]] "[[Megillat Antiochus]]" was read in the [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] [[synagogues]] on Hanukkah just as the [[Book of Esther]] is read on [[Purim]]. It still forms part of the liturgy of the [[Yemenite Jews]].<ref name = "pvgsyw"/>

=== ''Zot Hanukkah'' ===
The last day of Hanukkah is known as ''Zot Hanukkah'', from the verse read on this day in the synagogue (Numbers 7:84, ''Zot Chanukat Hamizbe'ach'', "This was the dedication of the altar"). According to the teachings of [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]], this day is the final "seal" of the High Holiday season of [[Yom Kippur]], and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other ''Gmar chatimah tovah'' ("may you be sealed totally for good"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.

==Judith and Holofernes==
[[Image:Cristofano Allori 002.jpg|thumb|left|''Judith with the head of Holofernes'' by Cristofano Allori]]

The eating of dairy foods, especially cheese, on Hanukkah is a minor custom that has its roots in the story of Judith. The [[deuterocanonical]] book of [[Judith]] (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the [[Tanach]], records that, [[Holofernes]], an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews is cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the [[Judith and Holofernes|beheading of Holofernes by Judith]] has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened, and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.

There is a longstanding Jewish tradition that Judith was the daughter of Yochanan the [[Kohen Gadol]] (and consequently a sister of Mattathias the Hasmonean and an aunt of Judah the Maccabee). In the [[Rema]]'s gloss on the [[Shulchan Aruch]] he writes “''There are authorities (Kol Bo and the [[Nissim of Gerona|RaN]]) who say that one should eat cheese on Hanukkah, because the miracle was performed with milk that Judith fed the enemy.''”<ref>''[[Rema]] on [[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 670:2</ref> The [[Chofetz Chaim]] there adds in his [[Mishna Berurah]] on the words “'''''that Judith fed''''',” “''She was the daughter of Yochanan, the Kohen Gadol. There was a decree that every espoused bride should submit to the dignitary first before the consummation of her marriage. She fed cheese to the head of the oppressors in order to intoxicate him and cut his head and they all fled.''”<ref>''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' 670:2:10</ref>

Generally women are exempt in Jewish law from time bound positive commandments, however the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles “''for they too were involved in the miracle.''”<ref>Babylonian Talmud: Shabbat 23a</ref> This account of Judith’s involvement with the events of Chanukah serves to explain the requirement of women to participate in the rituals of Hanukkah and the origins of the custom of eating dairy during the holiday.

==Interaction with modernity and with other traditions==
The classical rabbis downplayed the military and nationalistic dimensions of Hanukkah, and some even interpreted the emphasis upon the story of the miracle oil as a diversion away from the struggle with empires that had led to the disastrous downfall of Jerusalem to the Romans. With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, these themes were rapidly reconsidered. In modern Israel, Hanukkah was transformed into a celebration of military strength, a kind of antidote to what was perceived as the idea of the powerless [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jew]] that the Zionists felt that the Jews in the State of Israel needed to psychologically overcome.

In North America especially, Hanukkah gained increased importance with many Jewish families in the latter half of the twentieth century, including large numbers of [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]], who wanted a Jewish alternative to the [[Christmas]] celebrations that often overlap with Hanukkah. Though it was traditional to give "gelt" or money coins to children during Hanukkah, in many families this has changed into gifts in order to prevent Jewish children from feeling left out of the Christmas gift giving.

While Hanukkah traditionally speaking is only a minor Jewish holiday, as indicated by the lack of restrictions on work other than a few minutes after lighting the candles, Hanukkah has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.

===Green Hanukkah===
Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's "miracle of the oil", emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.<ref>[http://www.shalomctr.org/node/1315 Shalom Center on Hannukah and the environment]</ref><ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1195546797524&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Jerusalem Post: Green Hanukkia' campaign sparks ire]</ref><ref>[http://www.coejl.org/climatechange/CFLceremony.php Coalition on Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL): Green Hannukah ceremony]</ref>

==Hanukkah music==
{{main|Hanukkah music}}
There are several songs associated with the festival of Hanukkah. The most well known in English-speaking countries include "Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel" and "Chanukah, Oh Chanukah". In Israel, Hanukkah has become something of a national holiday. A large number of songs have been written on Hanukkah themes, perhaps more so than for any other Jewish holiday. Some of the most well known are "''Hanukkiah Li Yesh''" ("I Have a Hanukkah Menora"), "''Kad Katan''" ("A Small Jug"), "''S'vivon Sov Sov Sov''" ("Dreidel, Spin and Spin"), ''Haneirot Halolu''" ("These Candles which we light"), "''Mi Yimalel''" (Who can Retell") and "''Ner Li, Ner Li''" ("I have a Candle").

==Hanukkah foods==
[[Image:sufganiyah.jpeg|thumb|right|Sufganiyot with jelly]]
There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably [[olive oil]]), as the original miracle of the Hanukkah menorah involved the discovery of a small flask of pure olive oil used by the Jewish High Priest, the [[Kohen Gadol]]. This small batch of olive oil was only supposed to last one day, and instead it lasted eight. 

Accordingly, [[potato pancakes]], known as [[latkes]] in [[Yiddish]], are traditionally associated with Hanukkah, especially among [[Ashkenazi]] families, as they are prepared by frying in oil. Similarly, many [[Sephardic]], [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish]] and [[Israeli]] families have the custom of eating all kinds of jam-filled [[doughnut]]s ({{lang-yi|פאנטשקעס ''[[Pączki|pontshkes]]''}}), ([[bimuelos]], or [[sufganiyah|sufganiyot]]) which are [[Frying|deep-fried]] in oil. 

There is also a tradition of eating dairy products on Hannukah that is recorded in rabbinic literature. This custom is seen as a commemoration of the involvement of Judith and thus women in the events of Hannukah (see [[Hanukkah#Judith_and_Holofernes|Judith and Holofernes]] above).

==Hanukkah games==
===Dreidel===
{{main|Dreidel}}
[[Image:Dreidel 001.jpg|thumb|right|Dreidel]]
The ''dreidel'', or ''sevivon'' in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with on Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter. These letters are an acronym for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם ('''''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''aya '''S'''ham'', "A great miracle happened there"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beit Hamikdash]].
* נ ''([[Nun (letter)|Nun]])''
* ג ''([[Gimel (letter)|Gimel]])''
* ה ''([[He (letter)|Hey]])''
* ש ''([[Shin (letter)|Shin]])''

In [[Israel|Eretz Yisroel]], the fourth side of most dreidels is inscribed with the letter פ ''([[Pe (letter)|Pe]])'', rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה ('''''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''aya '''P'''o'', "A great miracle happened here"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel. Some stores in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] neighbourhoods may sell the traditional ''Shin'' dreidels.

Some Jewish commentators ascribe symbolic significance to the markings on the dreidel. One commentary, for example, connects the four letters with the four exiles to which the nation of Israel was historically subject: Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome.<ref>[http://www.ohr.org.il/yhiy/article.php/1309 Ohr Somayach :: Chanukah :: The Secret of the Dreidel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After lighting the Hanukkah menorah, it is customary in many homes to play the dreidel game: Each player starts out with 10 or 15 coins (real or of chocolate), nuts, raisins, candies or other markers, and places one marker in the "pot." The first player spins the dreidel, and depending on which side the dreidel falls on, either wins a marker from the pot or gives up part of his stash. The code (based on a [[Yiddish Language|Yiddish]] version of the game) is as follows:
* Nun&ndash;''nisht'', "nothing"&ndash;nothing happens and the next player spins
* Gimel&ndash;''gants'', "all"&ndash;the player takes the entire pot
* Hey&ndash;''halb'', "half"&ndash;the player takes half of the pot, rounding up if there is an odd number
* Shin&ndash;''shtel ayn'', "put in"&ndash;the player puts one marker in the pot

Another version differs:
* Nun&ndash;''nim'', "take"&ndash;the player takes one from the pot
* Gimel&ndash;''gib'', "give"&ndash;the player puts one in the pot
* Hey&ndash;''halb'', "half"&ndash;the player takes half of the pot, rounding up if there is an odd number
* Shin&ndash;''shtil'', "still" (as in "stillness")&ndash;nothing happens and the next player spins

The game may last until one person has won everything.

Some say the dreidel game is played to commemorate a game devised by the Jews to camouflage the fact that they were [[Torah study|studying Torah]], which was outlawed by Greeks. The Jews would gather in caves to study, posting a lookout to alert the group to the presence of Greek soldiers. If soldiers were spotted, the Jews would hide their scrolls and spin tops, so the Greeks thought they were gambling, not learning.

===Hanukkah ''gelt''===
Hanukkah ''gelt'' ([[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] for "money") is often distributed to children to enhance their enjoyment of the holiday. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or other relatives may give larger sums as an official Hanukkah gift. In Israel, Hanukkah ''gelt'' is known as ''dmei Hanukkah''. Many Hasidic [[Rebbe]]s distribute coins to those who visit them during Hanukkah. Hasidic Jews consider this to be an auspicious blessing from the Rebbe, and a ''[[segulah]]'' for success.

Rabbi Abraham P. Bloch has written that “''The tradition of giving money (Chanukah gelt) to children is of long standing. The custom had its origin in the seventeenth-century practice of Polish Jewry to give money to their small children for distribution to their teachers. In time, as children demanded their due, money was also given to children to keep for themselves. Teen-age boys soon came in for their share. According to [[Magen Avraham]] (18th cent.), it was the custom for poor yeshiva students to visit homes of Jewish benefactors who dispensed Chanukah money (Orach Chaim 670). The rabbis approved of the custom of giving money on Chanukah because it publicized the story of the miracle of the oil.''”<ref>The Biblical and Historical Background of Jewish Customs and Ceremonies by Abraham P. Bloch. Published by KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 1980. Pp. 277.</ref> 

Twentieth-century [[United States|American]] [[chocolatier]]s picked up on the gift/coin concept by creating [[chocolate money|chocolate ''gelt'']].

==Alternative spellings based on transliterating Hebrew letters==
[[Image:Hanukkah.png|right|thumb|Spelling variations are due to transliteration of Hebrew ''Chet Nun Vav Kaf Hey'']]
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word Hanukkah is written '''{{lang|he|חנֻכה}}''' or '''{{lang|he|חנוכה}}'''. It is most commonly transliterated to English as ''Chanukah'' or ''Hanukkah'', the latter because the sound represented by "CH" ([{{IPA|/χ/}}], similar to the [[Scots language|Scottish]] pronunciation of "[[loch]]") essentially does not exist in the modern English language. Furthermore, the letter "[[heth]]" ('''{{lang|he|ח}}'''), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew ([[voiceless uvular fricative]]) than in classical Hebrew ([[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is [[geminate]] in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling "Hanukkah"; while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no geminate and velar Ḥeth leads to the spelling "Chanukah".

===Common variants===
* Hanukkah (in North America and Australia, also common in UK)
* Chanukah (in the UK, also common in North America)

===YIVO variant===
* Khanike ([[YIVO]] standard [[transliteration]] from the Yiddish and/or Ashkenazic [[pronunciation]] of the Hebrew)

==When Hanukkah occurs==
{{further|[[Jewish holidays 2000-2050]]}}

The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the [[Hebrew calendar]]. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of [[Kislev]] and concludes on the 2nd or 3rd day of [[Tevet]] (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset, whereas the [[Gregorian calendar]] begins the day at midnight. So, the first day of Hanukkah actually begins at sunset of the day immediately before the date noted on Gregorian calendars.

===Hanukkah according to the Gregorian calendar===
Hanukkah begins at sundown on the evening before the date shown.
