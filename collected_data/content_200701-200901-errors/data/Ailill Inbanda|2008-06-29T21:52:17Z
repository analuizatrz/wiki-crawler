'''Ailill Inbanda''' mac Eógain (died 549)<ref>all dates per ''The Chronology of the Irish Annals'', Daniel P. McCarthy</ref> was a king of [[Connacht]] from the [[Ui Fiachrach]] branch of the [[Connachta]]. He was the son and successor of [[Eógan Bél]]<ref>Francis J.Byrne, ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'',Table 18</ref> who was slain by the northern [[Ui Neill]] in 542. His nickname Inbanda means "womanish" or effeminate.

His father's feud with the northern Ui Neill continued. He himself was slain at the Battle of Cúl Conaire in Cera, ([[County Mayo]]) along with his brother Áed Fortobol ("the strong") by Fergus and Domnall of the [[Cenél nEógain]], sons of [[Muirchertach mac Ercae]]. However Byrne believes this is a misinterpretation and that he was slain by his Fir Chera cousins of the Ui Fiachrach who were descended from a Macc Ercae as it was in their territory this battle was fought.<ref>Byrne, pg.244</ref>
