==Story==
''Sangokushi Online'' is set in the warring and chaotic times of the end of the Eastern Han dynasty in ancient China.
Power struggles among ambitious men were everywhere but particularly there were three men who have successfully rallied 
sufficient abled talents, enough to build the empire of their own. The player will join this triangular conquest of power by taking one of the three sides, in hope for the unification of [[China]]!

===World Setting===
[[Image:RTKOChengdu.png|thumb|left|Chengdu - A fortress city that is soothingly serene with bamboo planted within and yet strategically shielded by mountains all around]]
In ''Sangokushi Online'', the world of the virtual Three Kingdoms of ancient China is divided into five main regions, namely [[Jingzhou]], [[Sili]], [[Yizhou]], [[Yuzhou]] and [[Yangzhou]]. There are also five major village and cities, namely the Shuijing Village (a village that is named after a wise old recluse who is also known as [[Sima Hui]]), [[Chang'an]], [[Chengdu]], [[Xuchang]] and [[Jianye]]. The Shuijing Village, which is situated in [[Jingzhou]] is an activity hub for the beginning players between Level 1 and 10, while [[Chang'an]], which is found in [[Sili]] is the ideal place for players of Level 11 to Level 20. [[Chengdu]] is the stronghold of [[Liu Bei]] and it is located in [[Yizhou]]. [[Xuchang]] ([[Cao Cao]]'s stronghold) and [[Jianye]] ([[Sun Quan]]'s stronghold) are located in [[Yuzhou]] and [[Yangzhou]] respectively. The five regions are also peppered with dungeons of oriental mythological creatures and other minor villages. A sixth region, featuring the dry and barren desert region of northern China, known as [[Liangzhou]] has also been added in the Aug 2008 update<ref>Aug & Sep 2008 Major Update Part I [http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sol/developer/ryosyu/ryosyu1.htm]</ref>. While most places are accessible on foot, players can also move around by other modes of transportation, such as zoning by horse or boat.


==Gameplay==
The player will control a character [[avatar]] within a persistent game world and engage in activities such as exploring the landscape of ancient [[China]], fighting bandits and mythical creatures, running errands, quests or political assignment missions, learning combat and production skills, and interacting with both [[NPCs]] and fellow players. In return for engaging in such activities, the player will be rewarded for their effort with money and items. Unlike most [[MMORPGs]], player will be rewarded skill experience for using their skills which allows them to advance their skills further. Currently, players can level up the characters from Level 1 to 50<ref>Aug & Sep 2008 Major Update Part II [http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sol/developer/ryosyu/ryosyu2.htm]</ref>. Players also choose to join [[clans]] (known as [[guilds]] in most [[MMORPGs]]). Like other [[MMORPGs]], short term groups such parties and raids can  be formed to explore the different territories and [[instances]]. As players take side in one of the 3 forces, the [[Wu]] Force, the [[Shu]] Force and the [[Wei]] Force (which is led by the powerful warlords, [[Sun Quan]], [[Liu Bei]] and [[Cao Cao]] respectively), they will be able to take part in large scale ([[PvP]] & [[PvE]]) wars, with as many as 500 players on each side. At the end of each war session, players will be rewarded with rankings according to their performance during the war.
