'''"My Musical"''' is a five-time [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated musical episode of the [[United States|American]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''.  It follows Patti Miller (guest star [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]], of ''[[Avenue Q]]'' fame), a woman who mysteriously starts hearing everyone's speech as singing. The episode was written by [[Deb Fordham]], who also wrote most of the lyrics. The episode's music was composed by Fordham, ''Scrubs''‘ resident composer Jan Stevens, [[The Blanks (band)|The Worthless Peons]]' Paul Perry, [[Tony Award]]-winning Broadway composer Doug Besterman, and the ''Avenue Q'' writing team of [[Jeff Marx]] and [[Robert Lopez]]. The episode was directed by Will Mackenzie.

"My Musical" is the 123rd episode of the show, and was originally aired Episode 6 of Season 6 on [[January 18]], [[2007]].

== Plot ==
In the style of a traditional musical, this episode follows a two-[[act (theatre)|act]] structure<ref name="blog1">{{cite video |people= [[Deb Fordham]], [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]] |year= 2007 |date= January 13 |title= Scrubs Blog: My Musical - Part 1 |url= http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/01/13/scrubs-blog-my-musical-part-1/ |format= mov |publisher= Quick Stop Entertainment |accessdate= 2007-07-06}}</ref> – with the acts separated by a [[commercial break]] instead of an [[intermission]]. However, in the style of a traditional ''Scrubs'' episode, this is preceded by a [[cold open]]. 

=== Cold open ===
[[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D.]] and [[Elliot Reid|Elliot]] are in the park, when a woman, Patti Miller (D'Abruzzo), abruptly falls unconscious. As she returns to consciousness, she sees Elliot, J.D., and a worried group of onlookers singing to her ("All Right"). When she tries to respond, she sings too. In reality, no one is actually singing; Ms. Miller is hallucinating. She drifts out of consciousness, and wakes up being wheeled out an ambulance in the parking lot of [[Sacred Heart Hospital]], with all the hospital employees singing to her, "[[My_Musical#Welcome_to_Sacred_Heart|Welcome to Sacred Heart]]," led by [[Bob Kelso|Kelso]].

=== Act One ===
[[Doctor Cox|Dr. Cox]] tells J.D. he believes Ms. Miller is suffering from a psychological problem (as opposed to a neurological one), and tells him to run some tests and "turf her to [[Psychiatric hospital|psych]]."  [[Christopher Turk|Turk]] and J.D. approach Ms. Miller for a stool sample, explaining that "[[My_Musical#Everything_Comes_Down_to_Poo|Everything Comes Down to Poo]]."

[[Carla Espinosa|Carla]] has brought Isabella to the hospital, and everyone is cooing over the new baby, when Elliot comes in and announces happily that she just bought a new house. Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with Elliot. Carla has decided to take one year [[parental leave]], and [[Laverne Roberts|Laverne]], [[Ted Buckland|Ted]], and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's [[My_Musical#Gonna_Miss_You,_Carla|help]]. Carla begins to realize that she does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.

Ms. Miller stops Dr. Cox in the hall to insist that she is not crazy, when they are interrupted by J.D. Cox breaks into a rapid-fire [[My_Musical#The_Rant_Song|delivery]] of the litany of things J.D. does that annoys him, with some help from [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]]. Dr. Cox tells Ms. Miller that if she can get J.D. to leave him alone, she'll get the tests she wants. Ms. Miller yells at J.D., and an impressed Dr. Cox agree to schedule a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]].

Elliot and Carla worry about the difficult conversations they have to have with J.D. and Turk, respectively ("Options"). In the Act One [[My_Musical#When_the _Truth_Comes_Out|finale]], all the plotlines come together. Dr. Kelso offers Carla her job back, but she worries how to tell Turk. Elliot worries how to tell J.D. he's not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a gigantic [[aneurysm]] in her [[temporal lobe]]. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller before the act break.

=== Act Two ===
Carla and Elliot decide to confront Turk and J.D. Carla thinks that Turk and J.D. will help each other through the respective problems, but Elliot believes that guys cannot be open about their feelings. Quite the contrary, Turk and J.D. sing about their "[[My_Musical#Guy_Love|Guy Love]]."  Elliot breaks the news to J.D., who walks out of the room, refusing to talk to her. Carla tells Turk she wants to return to work. Turk responds by saying, "I always thought family was the most important thing to Puerto Ricans." She becomes angry, because she's [[My_Musical#For_the_Last_Time,_I'm_Dominican|Dominican]]. Turk tries to explain himself, and finally, agrees to support her decision. Elliot catches up with J.D., feeling awful, and offers to let him move in. He declines, and tells her they'll be "[[My_Musical#Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen|Friends Forever]]."

[[Image:ScrubsMyMusicalStephanieD'Abruzzo.png|thumb|right|200px|Ms. Miller, with shaved head, being prepared for surgery.]]
Ms. Miller interrupts them, afraid about her upcoming surgery, and asks, "[[My_Musical#Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen|What's Going to Happen?]]" The staff of Sacred Heart reassure her that she will be fine, which J.D. qualifies with "we hope," as she goes under [[anesthesia]].

When she awakes, she finds that the surgery was a success. She no longer hears singing. J.D. reflects in voiceover that after having made a choice, we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she misses her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music.

== Production details ==
It had long been a dream in the ''Scrubs'' writers' room to do a musical episode. ''Scrubs'' creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]] is a self-confessed musical theatre "nerd," as are many of the writers.<ref name="timeout">{{cite news |last= Lyons |first= Margaret |date= 2007-01-18 |title= The Best Medicine | publisher=TimeOut Chicago |url= http://www.timeout.com/chicago/Details.do?page=1&xyurl=xyl://TOCWebArticles1/99/time_in/the_best_medicine.xml |accessdate= 2007-01-24 }}</ref> In addition, many of the cast members have had backgrounds in musical theatre. According to Lawrence, "I knew that Donald [Faison] and Judy [Reyes] were Broadway-style singers and dancers. I knew Sarah [Chalke] could dance, because she danced when she was young. I knew Zach [Braff] loved musical theater. I had actually seen Ken Jenkins in ''[[Big River (musical)|Big River]]'' on Broadway when I was a kid. Neil Flynn and John McGinley were the last two guys to admit that they'd done a lot of musicals and stuff, but being actors, they had. Johnny C. knew how to do a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] number, and Neil had a big [[baritone]] voice."<ref name="tvguide">{{cite news |first=Angel |last=Cohn |title=Why You Must 'Tune' In to Tonight's Scrubs Musical! |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/tune-tonight-scrubs/070118-02 |publisher=TV Guide |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>

''Scrubs'' had previously dabbled in the musical genre, including a ''[[West Side Story]]'' parody in the episode "[[My Way or the Highway]]," and a Broadway-style finale in "[[My Philosophy]]." However, Lawrence had long been unwilling to do full musical episode, because of difficulties making it "organic to the show,"<ref name="tvguide"/> and because of the amount of work that would inevitably be involved.<ref name="timeout"/> Finally, at the end of Season 5, with Season 6 looking like it would probably be the last season; Lawrence told the writers that if they were ever going to do a musical episode, it should be in Season 6.<ref name="blog1"/>

Long-time ''Scrubs'' writer Deb Fordham took the challenge, and contacted the show's medical consultant, Jonathan Doris, who provided her with several case studies,<ref name="podcast">{{cite podcast | url = http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/podcast/nbc_scr_podcast_606_20070118.mp3 | title = My Musical: Commentary. | website = NBC | host = [[Sarah Chalke]] and [[Deb Fordham]] | date = January 18, 2007 | accessdate = 01-24 | accessyear = 2007 }}</ref> one of which ("[http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/inside.asp?AID=1173&UID= Musical hallucinations associated with seizures originating from an intracranial aneurysm]," published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings) became the basis for Ms. Miller's condition.<ref name="timeout"/> Unlike most episodes, which were products of the entire writers' room, "My Musical" was written almost entirely by Fordham - including most of the lyrics, even though Fordham had never written lyrics.<ref name="blog1"/>

The music, however, was not written by Fordham, but rather by several composers, including Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), ''Scrubs'' composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, each of whom helped write and arrange several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and [[Robert Lopez]], the writers of hit Broadway musical ''Avenue Q''. Marx and Lopez's involvement came at the suggestion of Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if it would be possible to get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode.<ref name="blog1"/> Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of [[musical genre]] suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in the same room.<ref name="blog1"/>

Intriguingly, the casting of Stephanie D'Abruzzo was done entirely independently of her starring role in ''Avenue Q''. Fordham wrote the part of Ms. Miller with D'Abruzzo in mind after seeing her in the off-Broadway show ''[[I Love You Because]]'', after D'Abruzzo had left ''Avenue Q''.<ref name="playbilldiva">{{cite news |first= Andrew |last= Gans |title= Chatting with Stephanie D'Abruzzo Plus Spring Awakening on CD |url= http://www.playbill.com/news/article/104837.html |work= Diva Talk |publisher = Playbill |date= 2007-01-12 |accessdate= 2007-07-08}}</ref> It another coincidence, D'Abruzzo had long been a fan of the show, and was overjoyed to have the chance to be on it.<ref name="blog2">{{cite video |people= [[Deb Fordham]], [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]] |year= 2007 |date= January 19 |title= Scrubs Blog: My Musical - Part 2 |url= http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/01/19/scrubs-blog-my-musical-part-2/ |format= mov |publisher= Quick Stop Entertainment |accessdate= 2007-07-06}}</ref>

Will Mackenzie was suggested by Fordham to direct the episode, because of his Broadway experience as Cornelius Hackle in ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' during the show's original Broadway run, opposite [[Carol Channing]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=85130 |title=   	
Will Mackenzie credits on Broadway |accessdate= 2007-07-07 |work= Internet Broadway Database}}</ref><ref name="podcast"/>

The filming of the episode was, as expected, a long process. Prior to the episode, the cast underwent a full week of rehearsals, something never before done for a ''Scrubs'' episode.<ref name="blog1"/> A group of eight core dancers were brought in for the dance numbers, while over fifty dancers were involved in the "Welcome To Sacred Heart" scene. There are some notable cameos in the episode, including episode composer Jeff Marx as a pharmacist in "Gonna Miss You, Carla;" occasional ''Scrubs'' musical contributor [[Keren DeBerg]] as an extra in "Are You Okay?"; and Broadway actress [[Karen Ziemba]] (a friend of Mackenzie's) as the neurologist.<ref name="podcast"/> Further complicating matters was the fact that Judy Reyes had recently fractured her pelvis,<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Scrubs' Star Injured in Fall|url= http://www.etonline.com/tv/news/37249/ |publisher= ETonline.com| date= 09-25-2006 |accessdate= 2007-07-06}}</ref> and so had to film all her scenes sitting down, and not dancing.<ref name="podcast"/> The bald cap D'Abruzzo wore during the end of the episode took four hours to put on, and she described it as very uncomfortable.<ref name="blog2"/>

== Musical numbers ==
[[Image:ScrubsMyMusicalWelcomeToSacredHeart.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Filming "Welcome to Sacred Heart"]]
The show features ten musical numbers, whose titles appear in the closing credits: "All Right," "Welcome to Sacred Heart," "Everything Comes Down to Poo," "Gonna Miss You, Carla," "The Rant Song," "Options," "When the Truth Comes Out," "Guy Love," "For the Last Time, I'm Dominican," and "Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen." <!--POSTING LYRICS TO THE MUSICAL EPISODE ARE COPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS.  PLEASE DO NOT DO SO.  A SITE THAT TRANSCRIBED THE LYRICS IS ALREADY IN THE EXTERNAL LINKS.  THANK YOU!-->

=== Welcome to Sacred Heart === 
"Welcome to Sacred Heart" was composed by Fordham, Marx, Lopez, and Besterman<ref name="podcast"/><ref name="playbill">{{cite news |first= Andrew |last= Gans |title= "Scrubs" Musical Episode, with Q's D'Abruzzo, Premieres Jan. 18 |url= http://www.playbill.com/news/article/104964.html |publisher= Playbill |date= 2007-01-18 |accessdate= 2007-07-07}}</ref> Fordham considers "Welcome To Sacred Heart" to be Dr. Kelso's song; Kelso (and especially Ken Jenkins' performance of Kelso) being Sacred Heart's [[Jerry Orbach]]/[[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]]-type showman, as in "[[Lullaby of Broadway (song)|Lullaby of Broadway]]" from ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]''.<ref name="blog1"/> "Be Our Guest" from ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was also cited as an influence.<ref name="blog1"/> Filming the sequence involved over fifty extras<ref name="podcast"/> and [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top shot kaleidoscopic choreography - which was achieved with a crane-mounted camera.<ref name="podcast"/> Dr. Cox [[jump rope|jumps rope]] during this scene because actor John C. McGinley cannot dance.

=== Everything Comes Down to Poo ===
"Everything Comes Down to Poo" was composed by Fordham, Marx, Lopez, and Besterman.<ref name="podcast"/><ref name="playbill"/>  The inspiration for the song came when one of the show's medical advisors, Jonathan Doris, shared his observation with Fordham that stool samples seemed to be asked for at hospitals no matter what was being diagnosed. The number was the latter of two music videos released by NBC on [[YouTube]] in advance of the episode's airdate - the other video being "Guy Love."<ref name="variety">{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Levine |title='Scrubs' tunes get YouTube preview |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956338.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |publisher=Variety |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> The videos have since been removed from YouTube, but are still available on [http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/video/index.shtml NBC's official ''Scrubs'' site].

The song's lyrics underwent many changes, in order to find the right level of vulgarity. The initial version was much more "genteel," while later versions included references to 'turtleheads' and other slang for [[feces]];<ref name="podcast"/> as was the line "It may sound gross, it may sound crass, but we need to see what comes out of your ass;" which was changed to "It may sound gross, you might say shush, but we need to see what comes out of your tush."<ref name="blog3">{{cite video |people= [[Jeff Marx]] |year= 2006 |date= November 3 |title= Scrubs Blog: Jeff Marx Musical Interview |url= http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2006/11/03/scrubs-blog-jeff-marx-talks-musical-scrubs/ |format= mov |publisher= Quick Stop Entertainment |accessdate= 2007-07-07}}</ref>

=== Gonna Miss You, Carla ===
"Gonna Miss You, Carla" was composed by Fordham and Perry (who sings during the song, as a member of The Worthless Peons).<ref name="podcast"/> D'Abruzzo has called this her favorite song in the episode.<ref name="blog2"/> Carla sits throughout the song because of Reyes' fractured pelvis.

=== The Rant Song ===
"The Rant Song" was composed by Fordham and Perry. The song is a Gilbert and Sullivan-style [[patter song]], in order to complement Dr. Cox's normal rapid-fire rants. Bill Lawrence has mentioned "[[Major-General's Song]]" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' as a specific influence. "We were mortified because ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip|Studio 60]]'' did [a 'Modern Major General' spoof] first.  But theirs isn't funny."<ref name="timeout"/> Fordham has described D'Abruzzo's section in this song as the episode's "[[Patti LuPone]] moment." <ref name="podcast"/> Fordham had long been a Patti LuPone fan (which is the reason D'Abruzzo's character was named Patti Miller).<ref>{{cite news |first= Michael |last= Portantiere |title=Scrubbing Up |url= http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm/story/9857 |publisher= Theatre Mania |date= 2007-01-13 |accessdate= 2007-07-08}}</ref>

Janitor's section in this song ("It all started with a penny in the door") refers to an incident in ''Scrubs''' pilot, "[[My First Day]]," when he became convinced J.D. had broken a door by wedging a penny in it. This incident was the beginning of the J.D.-Janitor antagonism.

=== When the Truth Comes Out ===
"When the Truth Comes Out" was composed by Fordham, Marx, and Lopez.<ref name="podcast"/> Unlike the other songs in the episode, this song was always intended as a direct parody of a single song: "[[One Day More (song)|One Day More]]" from ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]''. It also serves the same dramatic purpose as "One Day More": it is a showstopper finale to Act One that reprises all previous songs, summarizes Act One's events, and teases the events to come in Act Two.<ref name="blog1"/>  Carla does not march during this song, except for a few "painful steps" in this sequence, due to Reyes' aforementioned fractured pelvis. When Carla is seen from the back, she is portrayed by a double.<ref name="podcast"/>

=== Guy Love ===
"Guy Love" was composed by Fordham and Perry.<ref name="podcast"/> It was a late addition to the episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, "All the modern musicals like ''[[Jekyll & Hyde (musical)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'' have these really overwrought love songs, so we really wanted to have one between J.D. and Turk."<ref name="timeout"/> It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and he gave her the [[hook (music)|hook]], "It's guy love, between two guys." The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She emailed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, "and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, she sent me a list of 30 [moments],"  including Turk performing an [[appendicectomy]] on J.D. in "[[My Day Off]]."<ref name="podcast"/>  

"Guy Love" was the first of two music videos released by NBC on YouTube in advance of the episode's airdate - the other video being "Everything Comes Down To Poo."<ref name="variety"/> The videos have since been removed from YouTube, but are still available on [http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/video/index.shtml NBC's official ''Scrubs'' site]. In addition, the night before "My Musical" aired, actors Zach Braff and Donald Faison appeared as the musical guests on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'' to sing "Guy Love." The song also appeared later on ''Scrubs'', in "[[My Road to Nowhere]]", as Turk's cell phone [[ringtone]] for J.D. This is an apparent contradiction, considering that all the songs in this episode are merely Ms. Miller's hallucinations.

=== For the Last Time, I'm Dominican ===
"For the Last Time, I'm Dominican" was composed by Fordham, Perry, and Stevens.<ref name="podcast"/> Fordham knew she wanted to write a [[Latin American music|Latin-themed]] number for Carla, but could not decide on a style; so she "literally was on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] listening to every Latin style of music [she] could think of," before settling on a [[tango (dance)|tango]].<ref name="podcast"/> The sequence was filmed two months after [[principal photography]], to give Judy Reyes' pelvis enough time to heal for her to be able to tango.<ref name="podcast"/>

Every question Carla asks during the first verse has been answered in other episodes of the show. She grew up in [[Chicago]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Own Personal Jesus |episodelink=My Own Personal Jesus |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2001-12-11 |season=1 |number=11}}</ref> she was in medicine eight years before meeting Turk,<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Own American Girl |episodelink=My Own American Girl |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2003-10-02 |season=3 |number=1}}</ref> and their wedding song was [[The Beatles]]' "[[Eight Days a Week (song)|Eight Days a Week]]."<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Best Friend's Wedding |episodelink=My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs) |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2004-05-04 |season=3 |number=22}}</ref> As well, Turk has in several past episodes called Carla Puerto Rican, and in "[[My Last Chance (Scrubs)|My Last Chance]]," she angrily responded, "For the last time, Turk, I'm Dominican!"

=== Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen ===
[[Image:ScrubsMyMusicalFriendsForever.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Filming "Friends Forever"]]
"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen" was composed by Fordham, Marx and Lopez.<ref name="podcast"/> "Friends Forever" is a parody of [[1950s]]-style musical numbers in general, and "We Go Together" from ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in particular. However, this was not the original plan. According to Fordham, "I was really shocked when I got the demo back, because I had never envisioned a '50s number. I did mention 'We Go Together,' just as an example of I wanted a cheesy, fun, happy ending kind of a thing."<ref name="podcast"/> 

The song "What's Going to Happen" resembles several of the more "serious" numbers from ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]''.<ref name="timeout"/> Fordham has called Ms. Miller's solo in "What's Going to Happen" the easiest part of the episode for her to write.<ref name="blog1"/>

== Reception ==
The episode was received very well by critics and audiences alike. Many described initial misgivings that the musical concept would make the episode seem gimmicky,<ref name="IGN">{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Iverson |title=Scrubs: 'My Musical' Review |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/756/756780p1.html |publisher=IGN |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> but these fears were, for the most part, put to rest by the fact that the episode was "logically insane;"<ref name="IGN"/> the singing came about organically (through the brain aneurysm), and, despite the singing, the episode felt like it fit into the ''Scrubs'' continuity. Many noted that the songs fit the characters (like Dr. Cox's "Rant Song"), and that story arcs actually advanced in the episode (Carla returning to the hospital, and J.D. and Elliot no longer living together).<ref name="timeout"/><ref name="IGN"/><ref name="postg">{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Owen |title=Tuned In: 'Scrubs' sings love song to Broadway |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07017/754245-237.stm |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> On the other hand, others thought the music felt forced.<ref name="2guys">{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Wilkerson |title=Scrubs: My Musical |url=http://2guystalking.com/2gttrb/?p=103 |publisher=2GuysTalking |date=2007-01-20 |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Inevitably, almost all reviews, both positive and negative, compared the episode to ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''‘s musical episode, "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy episode)|Once More, with Feeling]]."<ref name="tvguide"/><ref name="IGN"/><ref name="2guys"/><ref name="postg"/> This comparison was also made by Bill Lawrence, who credits ''Buffy'' for inspiring ''Scrubs''‘ propensity for 'big' episodes (such as this one, the [[Multiple-camera setup|multi-camera]] "[[My Life in Four Cameras]]", and the ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' parody "[[My Way Home]]").<ref name="tvguide"/> The singing abilities of the cast (McGinley and Chalke in particular) came under some fire, but most critics agreed that most were competent, and anything beyond that simply did not matter.<ref name="zap2it">{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Porter |title=The Tease: Musical 'Scrubs' |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2007/01/the_tease_music.html |publisher=Zap2It |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref><ref name="IGN"/><ref name="tvguide"/><ref name="NYT">{{cite news |first=Ginia |last=Bellafante |title=Scrubs: Here Comes Rhymin’ Kelso and the Dancin’ ‘Scrubs’ Gang |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/arts/television/18bell.html?ex=1184126400&en=879560ebc2a83f14&ei=5070 |publisher=New York Times |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Reyes and Faison were the only members of the cast (besides the Broadway star D'Abruzzo) to receive praise for their singing abilities. In general, the final assessments were positive. The episode was called "the show's best episode thus far this season,"<ref name="zap2it"/> "worth all the hype,"<ref name="IGN"/> and "a heck of a lot of fun."<ref name="postg"/> Fans of the show also reacted positively, giving the episode, as of July 2007, a 9.0 on [[TV.com]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Scrubs: My Musical |publisher=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/scrubs/my-musical/episode/897936/summary.html |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> and a 9.3 on the [[Internet Movie Database]].<ref>{{cite web |title="Scrubs" My Musical (2007) |publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0937129/ |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

The episode also received praise from those who worked on it. D'Abruzzo described the experience of being on ''Scrubs'' as a "really great experience," and called the crew "one of the friendliest crews I've ever worked with."<ref name="blog2"/> Marx and Lopez, who had previously had misgivings about working in Hollywood, loved working on the show.<ref name="blog3"/> And Chalke described the episode as a unifying experience for the struggling show, mentioning that, for the first time in six years, the entire cast and crew met up to watch the episode together.<ref name="podcast"/>

At the 2007 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, the episode "My Musical" was nominated for five awards in four categories: [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series]] (Will Mackenzie), Outstanding Original Music And Lyrics ("Everything Comes Down to Poo" and "Guy Love"), Outstanding Music Direction (Jan Stevens), and Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Comedy Or Drama Series (half-hour) And Animation (Joe Foglia, Peter J.

These are ''Scrubs''‘ only nominations this year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/2007pt/nominations.php?action=search_db |title=Primetime Emmys Complete 2007 Nominations List |accessdate=2007-07-19 |work=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences}}</ref> The award winners will be announced [[September 16]], [[2007]].
