The '''international schools at Skagerak''' are a group of private schools located in [[Sandefjord]], [[Norway]]. They comprise a [[kindergarten]] (2005), [[primary school]], [[middle school]] (both 2000), and a [[high school]] (1991).  Together, they promote mutual [[respect]], [[intercultural]] [[awareness]] and international-mindedness through the [[International Baccalaureate]] programmes: the Diploma, Middle Years and Primary Years programmes. The PYP was authorized in June 2006 and the Middle School is a candidate for MYP authorization in June 2007.

The Kindergarten is located in Solvangveien, the Primary School in Kjellbergveien, and the Middle and High Schools in Framnesveien, housed in the old [[Framnæs shipyard]] mechanical workshop and facilities.

The Skagerak schools were founded with the goal of providing a high level of education and quality teaching with respect to each individual student. The schools’ population is made up of a mix of Norwegian students, those who have lived overseas, and students with a variety of other nationalities. Although English is the language of instruction, students are, or become, [[bilingual]] and a number of additional languages are offered in the middle and high schools. Teachers at Skagerak come from many different countries.   Although relatively small, Skagerak offers students a varied [[curriculum]] with opportunities such as outdoor education, cultural trips, service, performing arts and sport.
