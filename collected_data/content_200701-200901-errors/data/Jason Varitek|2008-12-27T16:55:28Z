'''Jason Andrew Varitek''' ({{pronEng|ˈvɛɹɨˌtɛk}}, born April 11, 1972 in {{city-state|Rochester|Michigan}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[baseball]] player who is currently a free agent. After being traded as a minor league prospect by the [[Seattle Mariners]], Varitek has played his entire major league career for the [[Boston Red Sox]]. A three-time all-star and [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Award winner]] at [[catcher]], Varitek was an integral part of the [[2004 World Series]] and [[2007 World Series]] Championship teams. In December 2004 he was named the [[Major League Baseball Team Captains|captain]] of the Red Sox, only their third captain since 1923.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/12/24/sox_have_deal_to_keep_varitek/ Boston.com - Sox re-sign Varitek, name him captain]</ref> He is a [[switch-hitter]]. His nicknames include "The Captain" and "'Tek" (his chest protector has the monogram "TEK" on its collar).<ref>[http://static.flickr.com/68/161681622_d8fb50196e.jpg?v=0]</ref>

Varitek is one of only two players in the history of the sport to have played in the World Championship game of the [[Little League World Series]], in the National Championship game of the [[College World Series]], and in the Major League [[World Series]] ([[Ed Vosberg]] is the other). Varitek stands alone as the only baseball player in history to have played in the three aforementioned World Series along with playing on the [[Baseball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Olympic Baseball]] team, and in the [[World Baseball Classic]]. As well, his [[Lake Brantley High School]] baseball team won the Florida State Championship his senior year in 1990 and was named the number one high school baseball team in the nation by a USA Today poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jason-varitek.com/biography.htm|title=Jason Varitek biography}}</ref> Varitek has caught an MLB record four [[no-hitter]]s.

==Little League career==
[[Image:Variteklittleleagueworldseries.jpg|thumb|left|Jason Varitek in the [[Little League World Series]], 1984]]
Varitek was born in {{city-state|Rochester|Michigan}}. He played in the [[1984 Little League World Series]], leading his {{city-state|Altamonte Springs|Florida}} team to victory in the United States Championship bracket in a 4-2 victory over [[Southport, Indiana]]. His team then fell in the [[Little League World Series#Little League World Series champions|world championship game]] to the international champion from [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], by a score of 6-2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/littleleague/|title=Sporting News History of LLWS}}</ref> Varitek played [[shortstop]], [[third base]], and [[catcher]] in his three LLWS games, performing well defensively, but was hitless going 0 for 7 with two walks and a run scored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/media/jasonvsjason.asp|title=Jason vs. Jason: LLB World Series Participants Square Off in MLB World Series}}</ref>

==High school and college==
While in high school, Varitek was a third baseman and catcher for the [[Lake Brantley High School]] baseball team in Altamonte Springs, FL. The Patriots' usual catcher was Jerry Thurston, himself a pro prospect. In 1990, the Patriots won the state championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhsaa.org/records/rec_ba.pdf|title=History of Florida State Champions|format=PDF}}</ref> He was also a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team and won the [[Dick Howser Trophy]] for National Collegiate Player of the Year. He was also named Baseball America's 1993 College Player of the Year; he appeared in 3 games for the U.S. team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.

Varitek attended [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], where he helped lead the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets baseball|Yellow Jackets baseball team]] to the 1994 [[College World Series]] championships, along with teammates [[Nomar Garciaparra]] and [[Jay Payton]]. He graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in management and is the only Tech baseball player to have his number (33) retired.

==Early professional career==
Varitek played two summers in the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]] with the [[Hyannis Mets]]. In {{by|1993}}, he hit .371 while winning both the league batting championship and MVP. He was drafted 21st overall in the first round by the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1993,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jason-varitek.com/articles/insidebaseball.htm|title=Inside Baseball at the College World Series}}</ref> but opted to return for his senior year of college. Following graduation, Varitek signed with agent [[Scott Boras]] and was drafted by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in the first round of the {{by|1994}} amateur draft, with the 14th pick overall.<ref name="six">{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/111402aaa.html|title=Varitek, Garciaparra Inducted Into Cape Cod Baseball Hall of Fame}}</ref> A pioneer of the loopholes in the draft process, Varitek signed with the [[St. Paul Saints]] in the independent [[Northern League (baseball)|Northern League]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jason-varitek.com/articles/varitekseatleagree.htm|title=Varitek, Seattle finally agree; MLB averts lawsuit}}</ref> before agreeing to terms with the Mariners, and consequently did not enter the Mariners' [[minor league]] system until {{by|1995}}. When he finally did join the franchise, Varitek was sent to the AA affiliate [[Port City Roosters]] where he first met [[pitcher]] and longtime teammate [[Derek Lowe]]. He was traded with Lowe to the Red Sox during the {{by|1997}} season, in return for [[relief pitcher|reliever]] [[Heathcliff Slocumb]], often cited as one of the best trades in the Red Sox's favor in recent history.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

==Major league career==
===1998 rookie year - 2001===
Varitek was called up for a single game on [[September 24]], 1997, collecting a single in his only at bat. The next season, Varitek split time with incumbent catcher [[Scott Hatteberg]] playing in 86 games.<ref name="bbr">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml|title=Baseball Reference}}</ref> Varitek showed signs of things to come in the {{by|1998}} season and with a strong [[spring training]] following the season, Varitek ensured himself the starting role. {{by|1999}} was a breakout year for the young catcher; he played 144 games in that season while hitting for a .269 average, with 20 [[home runs]], and 76 [[RBI]]s.<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref>Varitek went 5-21 with 3 RBI in the [[1999 American League Division Series|1999 ALDS]] against the [[Cleveland Indians.<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref> and 4-20 with 1 RBI in the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] against the [[New York Yankees]]..<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref> Varitek looked forward to building on his success from the year before, but in {{by|2000}} he did not show the same potential and had a disappointing offensive output. He hit just .248 with only 10 home runs and 65 RBI.<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref> Prior to the {{by|2001}} season, Varitek signed a 3 year $14.9 million contract with the Red Sox, and off to a hot start before he was sidelined for the season with a broken left elbow after he dove to catch a foul ball on [[June 7]]. The play went on to be a top [[Web gem|Web Gem]] for the month of July in 2001. Varitek finished the season with a .293 average, 7 home runs, and 25 RBI in just 51 games played.<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref>

===2002 and 2003===
Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup fulltime in the {{by|2002}} season. The return did not go smoothly, however, as Varitek struggled to find himself at the plate. Despite not reaching his full offensive potential,<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref> pitchers and coaches alike began to notice how much Varitek's preparation and knowledge of the game was helping the pitchers. His study habits and extra hours of work with pitchers would soon become his defining attribute and make him a household name around the league. Varitek and the Red Sox entered the {{by|2003}} season with a renewed fire to reach the playoffs after missing in the previous three years. Varitek instantly became a leader in the clubhouse which management tried to portray as working class, featuring new faces such as [[Kevin Millar]], [[David Ortiz]], [[Bill Mueller]], and [[Todd Walker]] along with original players [[Trot Nixon]] and [[Lou Merloni]]. 2003 was Varitek's best year to date and earned his first all-star selection after the fans voted him on with the [[All-Star Final Vote]]. He was hitting .296 with 15 HRs and 51 RBIs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/news/mlb_news.jspymd=20030709&content_id=417344&vkey=allstar2003&fext=.jsp|title=2003 Varitek, Jenkins are All-Stars}}</ref> going into the all-star break and finished the season off with a solid .273 average, 25 HRs and 85 RBIs,<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref> all career highs. Varitek also led the Red Sox to a [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball Wild Card|Wild Card]] berth and their first playoff appearance since 1999.

===2004 and the World Series===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:WorldSeriesRing.jpg|thumb|A 2004 Boston Red Sox World Series Ring. Ring courtesy of Red Sox Vice-Chairman [[Les Otten]]]] -->
In {{by|2004}}, Varitek compiled a career-high .296 [[batting average]] with 18 [[home run]]s and 73 [[Run batted in|RBI]]. During a nationally televised game on [[July 24]], 2004, Varitek shoved his glove into the face of Yankees' Alex Rodriguez to protect [[Bronson Arroyo]], causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodriguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11-10 come from behind victory. It is also sometimes regarded as the turning point in the Red Sox season, as they posted MLB's best record after the melee. The Red Sox culminated the season with their first [[World Series]] championship in 86 years. Having played in this World Series, Varitek became the second player to have played in the Little League World Series, College World Series, and Major League World Series. At the end of the year, Varitek became a [[free agent]] and signed a 4-year, $40-million contract with the Red Sox.

===Free agency and promotion to Captain===
After Varitek's re-signing, the Red Sox appointed him to be the third team captain since {{by|1923}}, after [[Carl Yastrzemski]] ({{by|1969}}-{{by|1983|83}}) and [[Jim Rice]] ({{by|1986}}-{{by|1989|89}}). There are currently only two other captains in Major League Baseball: [[Derek Jeter]] of the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Paul Konerko]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]].

According to Red Sox fans, Varitek is valued as a catcher for his ability to work with pitchers, using scouting reports and video footage to plan each game. He also won his first [[Gold Glove Award]], his first [[Silver Slugger]], and his second All-Star selection in {{by|2005}}.

In {{by|2006}}, Varitek represented the United States in the [[World Baseball Classic]]. He made the most of his playing time, hitting a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam home run]] against Team Canada allowing [[USA Baseball|Team USA]] to narrow an 8&ndash;2 lead down to 8&ndash;6. Team Canada, however, kept the lead in the [[upset]] victory.

On [[July 18]], 2006, Varitek played his 991st game at catcher for the [[Boston Red Sox]], breaking [[Carlton Fisk]]'s club record. That game was a home game vs. [[Kansas City Royals|Kansas City]], during which Varitek's achievement was recognized before the top of the 5th inning (after the game was official and couldn't be cancelled due to weather). Varitek received a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at [[Fenway Park]] for a few moments before play began. On [[July 31]], 2006, Varitek was injured rounding the bases in a 9&ndash;8 victory over the Cleveland Indians (his 1000th career game as catcher), but said he believed the initial injury to the knee occurred while he was blocking home plate to make the tag against the Angels [[Mike Napoli]] on [[July 29]], 2006. He had surgery on [[August 3]], 2006 to repair torn cartilage in his left knee. Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup on [[September 4]], following a short rehabilitation assignment in Pawtucket.

On [[September 19]], 2006, Jason was honored during a pre-game ceremony as the first Red Sox catcher to catch 1,000 games. The Red Sox Captain was presented with a special award by Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk, who held the Boston club record with 990 career games caught before Varitek surpassed that total on [[July 18]] versus Kansas City. The Sox backstop caught his 1000th game on [[July 31]] and by the evening of the ceremony had appeared in 1,009 games behind the plate.
That same night, Jason also received the 2006 Red Sox Heart and Hustle Award from the local chapter of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, which is presented to a player exemplifying the values, tradition, and spirit of the game of baseball.

In 2007, Varitek and the Red Sox returned to the World Series once again, winning for the second time in four years. During the season, Varitek enjoyed a couple of personal highlights, reaching his 1000th career hit. On May 19, 2008, he caught [[Jon Lester]]'s no-hitter, giving him a Major League record of having caught four separate no-hitters in his career. 

In honor of being captain, Jason released Captain Cabernet, a charity wine with proceeds benefiting Pitching In For Kids and Children's Hospital Boston.[http://www.charitywines.com/varitek.html][http://www.pitchinginforkids.org/charity_wine.php]

At the end of the 2008 season, Varitek opted for free agency. Reports in the Boston Globe suggest that his agent, [[Scott Boras]], is using New York Yankee catcher [[Jorge Posada]]'s four-year, $52.4 million deal as a benchmark for negotiations.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/thebuzz/ | title=Boras sees Posada's 4-year, $52m deal as benchmark | date=2008-11-05 | accessdate=2008-11-05|author=|publisher=[[Boston Globe]]}}</ref>
