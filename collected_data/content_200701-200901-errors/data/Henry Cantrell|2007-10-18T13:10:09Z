'''Henry Cantrell''' (baptized [[17 September]] [[1684]] at St Oswald's, [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]], [[Derbyshire]], probably died [[1773]]) was a high-church [[Church of England]] [[clergyman]] and religious controversialist.

==Education==
The son of Simon Cantrell (1658–1744), he was educated at [[Derby School]] (where a relation, the Rev. Thomas Cantrell, 1649-1698, was headmaster)<ref>B. Tacchella, ed., The Derby School register, 1570–1901 (1902), p. 8</ref> and [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]. He matriculated at Cambridge in 1701, graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1705 and [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1710<ref>J. Venn and J. A.

==Career summary==
Cantrell was ordained a [[priest]] at [[Lichfield]] in 1709. In 1712, the corporation of [[Derby]] gave him the vicarage of St Alkmund, Derby<ref name="dnb"/>, a living he kept for more than sixty stormy years, until his death at the age of eighty-nine. 

Cantrell had a quarrelsome nature, and even before his induction as Vicar of St Alkmund's parish he fell out with its vestry, insisting on exercising his right to appoint one of the two churchwardens for the parish<ref>Vestry book, St Alkmund's parish, Derby, 1698–1783, Derbyshire Record Office, accession D916A/PV 1/1</ref><ref name="dnb"/>. Within months of his appointment, he was preaching against non-conformity, claiming that:

{{cquote|Dissenting teachers have no authority to baptize, and consequently that children... sprinkled by 'em, ought to be baptiz'd by an Episcopal minister.<ref>St Alkmund's register, 5 Nov 1712</ref>}} 

He refused to bury children baptized by dissenters, which led to a furious controversy in Derby. In any event, Cantrell's bishop refused to support his stance.<ref name="dnb"/> 

One of Cantrell's best-known works was a scholarly dissertation denying the claim by the [[Presbyterian]] minister Ferdinando Shaw that [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had been baptized only by a Presbyterian and never by an [[Anglicanism|Episcopal]] minister.<ref name="dnb"/> 

Cantrell was often embattled in defending his clerical rights, including the right to plant trees in the churchyard, to control the contents of the parish register, and so forth, generally claiming the matter in hand was about an important principle and part of a wider defence of clerical rights.<ref name="dnb"/> In 1729, he defeated the Corporation of Derby (the patrons of his living) in a legal battle over the parish's small tithes, which the Corporation had taken away from him for insulting the Mayor of Derby. <ref>[[British Library]], MS Stowe 119, folio 76v</ref>

When his battles led to the forced sale of much of his library, he was offered the vicarage of [[Brecon]] through the influence of [[Henry Sacheverell|Dr Henry Sacheverell]], but declined it.<ref name="dnb"/> 

When Cantrell granted a licence for the secret marriage of Annabella Wilmot of [[Osmaston]], Derbyshire, this led to the Ecclesiastical Courts Bill 1733.<ref name="dnb"/> 

Doubt has been cast on the claim in William Hutton's ''History of Derby'' (1791) that at the time of the [[Jacobite rising]] in [[1745]] Cantrell was a Jacobite and drank the health of the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]].<ref name="dnb"/><ref name="hutton">''A History of Derby'' by William Hutton (1791)</ref><ref>L. Eardley-Smith, Derby and the forty-five (1933), p. 14</ref>

==Family==
Cantrell first wife, Constance, was born in 1695 or 1696 and died on 24 May 1725. Their eldest surviving son became the Rev. William Cantrell (1716–1787), Rector of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]] and [[Normanton, Derby City|Normanton]], Derbyshire. On 2 August 1732, Henry Cantrell married secondly Jane Cradock, a daughter of Joseph Cradock, Rector of [[Markfield]], [[Leicestershire]].<ref name="dnb"/>
