'''Eggheads''' is a [[BBC]] [[quiz]] [[game show]] presented by [[Dermot Murnaghan]].
The Eggheads are a team, made up of five British quiz champions who compete against a new panel of challengers each episode. 

==Quiz champions==
The quiz champions who compete on the show are:
*[[Kevin Ashman]]: winner of ''[[British Quiz Championship]]'', ''European Quiz Championship'', ''[[World Quizzing Championships]]'', ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[Brain of Britain]]'' and ''[[Mind Sports Olympiad]]''. 
*[[CJ De Mooi]]: winner of ''[[BrainTeaser]]'', ''[[100% (game show)|100%]]'' and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' as well as having been [[Mensa International|Mensa]] chess champion.
*[[Daphne Fowler]]: winner of ''Fifteen to One'', ''Brain of Britain'' and ''[[Going for Gold]]''.
*[[Christopher Hughes]]: winner of ''Mastermind'', ''[[International Mastermind]]'' and former ''Brain of Britain''.
*[[Judith Keppel]]: first British winner of one million pounds on ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK)#Million pound winners|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''

==Format==
There are four main rounds, in which the challengers are given a category, and choose one of their players to play against an Egghead of their choice, and they choose whether or not to go first — all aspects designed to give the challengers an advantage. They are asked three [[multiple choice]] questions each; if these result in a tie, non-multiple choice questions are asked in pairs, in a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] fashion. Possible categories for these rounds include Arts and Books, Entertainment, Food and Drink, History, Geography, Politics, Science and Sport. The contestants don't know the categories or their order in advance, but are guaranteed that at least one of Entertainment or Sport will come up.

After the main rounds the final takes place, in which the losing players from the main round are not allowed to compete and a dominant team could thus have a 5–1 advantage. All remaining players are allowed to confer and the category is always General Knowledge.

Should the challengers win, they receive £1,000 plus a further £1,000 for each day the Eggheads had previously gone undefeated. Defeat usually leads Murnaghan to ask "Congratulations Eggheads, can anyone beat you?" The Eggheads have a tendency to show off somewhat, often giving extra information or using obscure cross-references to come to their answers. 

==History==
The show has been running for six series, represented by the same five Eggheads. The first team to defeat the Eggheads was the ''Unicorn Inn'' from [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], who won the thirteenth edition on 26 November 2003 in a sudden death tie break.

Following the show broadcast on [[26 September]] [[2006]], the Eggheads had won the last 36 games, which is a record for the team. On the [[27 September]], [[2006]] broadcast, the Eggheads lost, and the challenging team (''Second Class'', a group of [[postman|postmen]] from the [[Outer Hebrides]]) won £37,000 &mdash; the highest prize on the show so far.

The show, which is made by [[12 Yard|12 Yard Productions]], is often repeated in an early-evening slot on [[BBC Two]]. Other repeats of the series can be seen on digital channel [[Challenge]].
