'''Tony Warriner''' wrote his first video game, ''Obsidian'' for [[Amstrad]] CPC, in 1986. The game was published by [[Artic Computing]] and received strong reviews. After leaving Artic, Tony had a spell at Cascade Games and then Bytronic, writing air traffic control software. In 1990 Tony and [[Charles Cecil]], who he had met at Artic Computing, founded [[Revolution Software]] together with David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. 

Tony wrote the ''[[Virtual Theatre]]'' engine for the Revolution’s first release ''[[Lure of the Temptress]]'' which was published by [[Virgin Interactive]] on [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] in 1992. The engine was developed for Revolution’s second release ''[[Beneath a Steel Sky]]'', published by Virgin in 1994.

As the team size increased, Tony took on a role straddling design and programming for Revolution’s ''[[Broken Sword]]'' series of games. 

Currently Tony spends part of his time working with Revolution, and part of his time on his own projects.
