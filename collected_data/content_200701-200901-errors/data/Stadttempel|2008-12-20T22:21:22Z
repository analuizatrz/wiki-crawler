The '''Stadttempel''' ([[English language|en]]: City-Temple or City-Synagogue) is the main [[synagogue]] of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It is located in the 1st [[Districts of Vienna|District]] ([[Innere Stadt]]), at Seitenstettengasse 4.

The synagogue was constructed from 1825 to 1826 by the Viennese architect [[Joseph Kornhäusel]] in elegant [[Biedermeier]] style. The luxurious ''Stadttempel'' was fitted into the block of houses and hidden from plain view from the street. This went back to an edict issued by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] that only Catholic places of worship were allowed to have a direct means of entry from the street. This situation actually saved the synagogue from total destruction during the ''[[Reichskristallnacht]]'' in November 1938, as the [[Nazism|Nazis]] were afraid that the whole block could go up in flames. The other 93 synagogues and [[Jewish]] prayer-houses of Vienna were badly damaged or destroyed. 


In the [[1981 Vienna synagogue attack]] two people were murdered and thirty injured when [[Palestinian]] [[Arab]] [[terrorist]]s attacked the synagogue with machine guns and hand grenades. 

Today the synagogue is the main temple for the Viennese Jewish Community of about 7,000 members.

In August 1949 the coffins of Theodor Herzl and his parents were displayed at the synagogue, prior to their transfer for burial in Israel.
