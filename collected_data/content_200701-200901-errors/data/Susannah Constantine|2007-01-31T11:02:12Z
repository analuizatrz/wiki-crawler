'''Susannah Constantine''' (born [[8 January]] [[1961]] in [[London]]) is an [[England|English]] [[television presenter]] and fashion journalist. She was best-known as the co-host, along with [[Trinny Woodall]], on the [[BBC]] style series ''[[What Not to Wear]]''. 

==Career==

Constantine is best know as a fashion guru. She teamed up in [[1994]] with Woodall, to write ''Ready to Wear'', a weekly style guide for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' which ran successfully for seven years. Constantine and Woodall were also co-founders of [[Ready2shop.com]], a [[dot-com]] fashion advice business that ceased trading after running out of funding in November [[2000]]. 

Constantine was well-know for co-hosting ''What not to Wear'' with Trinny Woodall, where they reformed people's images and style. They hosted the show from [[2001]] to [[2006]] and together the pair were sometimes known for their tactile behaviour. In 2003, Constantine and Woodall did a spin-off show; ''What Not to Wear on the Red Carpet'' in which they reformed [[Jo Brand]] and [[Sophie Raworth]]. Together, they have also written several style books as spin-offs from the series, some of which  includ ''What Not to Wear'' and ''What You Wear Can Change Your Life''. Their fashion books have been number one bestsellers in Britain and the United States and have been translated throughout the world. [http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=6606]

Constantine also voiced a robot version of herself in the popular [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. In the episode ''[[Bad Wolf]]'' in [[2005]], Trine-e and Zu-Zana were two robots acting out a deadly futuristic version of ''What not to Wear''. For charity, Woodall and Constantine have together appeared on ''[[Comic Relief]]: Red Nose NIght Live 05'' and on [[Children in Need]] in 2004. They have both appeared on ''[[Parkinson]]'' a couple of times.

Constantine and Woodall have defected from the BBC to [[ITV]] where they started their new show, ''[[Trinny and Susannah Undress]]'' on [[3 October]], 2006. Since then, ''What Not to Wear'' on [[BBC One]] has been hosted by [[Lisa Butcher]] and [[Mica Paris]]. In the same year, Constantine and Woodall launched their own underwear range; "Trinny and Susannah Magic Knickers" which are designed using elastic, to flatten the [[tummy]] and [[buttocks]] and [[thighs]], so that the areas appear slimmer.
