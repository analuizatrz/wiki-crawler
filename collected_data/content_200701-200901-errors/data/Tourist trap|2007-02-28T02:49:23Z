'''Tourist trap''' is a phrase for any [[establishment]] or set of establishments that have been created to attract [[travelers]] or [[tourists]] and provide products for the tourist to purchase.<ref>{{cite book

There is some ambiguity in the definition of the phrase as it relates to size, activities, cost of products, and legitimacy. Some operators prefer to call them "family-oriented tourist attractions".<ref>{{cite news

==Goods and Activities==
Tourist traps provide an opportunity to separate a consumer from their [[money]] and are oriented primarily towards non-native or non-local consumers. Because the tourist is on her or his way to a particular attraction, the tourist trap will either offer a distinctly contrary experience or an allied experience.  They will offer up "unique" natural or artificial features (the "World's Largest Ball of Twine" or "[[Silver Springs]]") that can only be had at the particular stop, and will then offer up conveniences or activities to entertain and capitalize upon the stopped tourist.

===Goods===
Typically goods available for purchase will include [[souvenirs]] and [[curiosities]] embossed with the name of the establishment and or local points of interest.  Additional products may include the normal range of items found in a [[Gift shop]].    

===Activities===
Activities at Tourist traps vary greatly based in part on the surrounding [[economy]] and [[infrastructure]].  In some areas like [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], [[Flush toilet]]s may be a sufficient draw to entice tourist to stop.  In other locations like [[Anaheim, California]] more robust activates are required to draw a tourist to a specific activity over a [[competitor]]s activity.  Other activities may include, [[thematic restaurant]]s, [[arcade game]]s, [[wax museum]]s, [[collection]]s of unique artifacts, and so on.

===Mule Rides=== 
[[Ralph H. Cameron]] <ref>{{cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000066 | title= Cameron, Ralph Henry, (1863 -1953); Biographical Directory of the United States Congress}}</ref> a former resident of [[Maine]], traveled west with his brothers around [[1880]].  Arriving in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] where they took up [[Sheep#Domestication|sheep herding]].  Ralph visited the nearby [[Grand Canyon]] and realizing its potential as a tourist trap began acquiring properties.  Before the [[Grand Canyon]] became a [[National Monument]] in 1906 the Cameron’s and accomplices had secured over 100 claims including some of the most scenic.   They improved an old Indian trail that would become [[Bright Angel Trail]] and began charging tourists a dollar toll.   For an additional fee you could rent a [[mule]] to take you to the bottom of the canyon.  At the bottom of the Grand Canyon the trapped tourist would have an opportunity to be [[Sheep shearing|sheared]] again as they were given an opportunity to hire a mule to carry them back to the top!  Other opportunities to separate tourists from their dollars included charging for [[Outhouse|comfort stations]].  <ref> Horace M. Albright and Marian Albright Schenck: “Creating the National Park Service: The Missing Years, Page 265, University of Oklahoma Press, 1999, ISBN 0-8061-3155-1 http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/albright2/ </ref> In 1928 after a legal battle Coconino Country gained ownership of the profitable toll trail. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kaibab.org/misc/gc_misc.htm#c | title=Cameron, Ralph on Grand Canyon Explorer}}</ref>  It costs more than a dollar now but you can still rent a mule to take you down the canyon.  The web site <ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.onlinepages.net/canyonrides/ | title=Canyon Trail Rides “The Only Ride in the National Parks”}}</ref> does not list the cost for the ride down or back up.

==Natural features==
When a significant natural curiosity is present, such as a geyser or a waterfall, the tourist trap will seek to highlight an allied or similar curiosity.  Therefore, in an area near [[Niagara Falls]], the [[Grand Canyon]], [[Old Faithful]], etc., tourist traps might be organized around "Little Falls" or "Painted Rock" or "Hot Springs."  These traps do not strive to compete with the tourism attraction as much as draw surplus commerce on the way to and from the attraction.  These parasitic tourist traps are in contrast to those which take advantage of the monotony and lack of attractions between conventional destination points.

==Size== 
[[Image:Fremont Street 1986.jpg|150px|right|Found on Wikicommons]]
Tourist traps range significantly in size, from a single tree <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tunneltree.com/redwood/hum-scot/eternal/eternal.html |title=The Eternal Tree House in Redcrest on the Redwood Highway}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tunneltree.com/tunneltree/tunneltree.html | title=Drive thru "The Stump" at the Redwood Shop near [[Pepperwood, Calif]]}}</ref> to the city of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].   There may be valid arguments to include traps that are bigger or smaller than these as well.

==Stop and Shop==

[[Image:05 Summer trip 04 Da Yoopers Tourist Trap Cropped.JPG|500px|thumbnail|center|"Da Yoopers Tourist Trap" Notice the 4x4 1957 chevy sedan and HUGE chain saw, there is also what is probably the worlds largest working rifle (mounted on a truck), it is all about getting you to stop and look, then shop.]]
A few establishments take pride in the term and embody it into their names, such as "Da Yoopers Tourist Trap" <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dayoopers.com/thetrap.html | title=Da Yoopers Tourist Trap}}</ref> in [[Michigan]]’s [[Upper Peninsula]], and "The TOURIST TRAP" <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shoptouristtrap.com | title=The TOURIST TRAP}}</ref> at [[Deep Creek Lake, Maryland]].  Other establishments like The "Trees of Mystery" <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.treesofmystery.net | title=Trees of Mystery}}</ref> in [[Klamath, California]] avoid the phrase.  If the term is embraced or not, regardless of the price of products, the two things that all tourist stops have in common are [[restroom]]s and items for sale with the name the establishment or other nearby [[points of interest]].

==Negative Impacts==
Current news articles point out that attracting a [[high volume]] of tourists can have negative impacts.  An article in The Washington Post “The True Meaning of the Tourist Trap” <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58323-2005Jan8.html | title=Article in The Washington Post “The True Meaning of the Tourist Trap”}}</ref> discuses the impact of the December 26, 2004 tsunami on the tourist themselves.  The New York Times in an article on November 1, 2006 <ref>{{cite web | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9B04EEDE1539F934A1575AC0A96E958260   | title=New York Times in an article Nov 1, 2006, Impacts of 33 million tourist}}</ref> discuses the impact of 33 million tourists a year on the city of New York.  Eco-tourism as outlined in an April 19, 2006 article in the Guardian <ref>{{ cite web | url=http://travel.guardian.co.uk/ecotourism/story/0,,1756634,00.html | title=Guardian April 19, 2006, Article on Eco-Tourism}}</ref> describes the potential to impact fragile environments.

==Popular culture references==
These kinds of attractions find their way into popular culture. A few examples, in addition to the [[Charles Ogden (children's writer)|Charles Ogden]] book and the [[Tourist Trap|horror film]] mentioned elsewhere on this page:
*In an episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which the four main players are driving to California, they see a sign advertising a Praline Pecans shop hundreds of miles away. As they approach its location, the signs appear with greater frequency, and their interest grows, only to learn that the store is out of business.
*In his 1978 novelty song, ''[[King Tut (song)|King Tut]]'', comedian [[Steve Martin]] referenced the traveling exhibit of ancient Egyptian artifacts, and mourned the loss of the Egyptian king who, he said, "gave his life for tourism."
*In the 1983 film ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', Ellen Griswold ridicules her husband, Clark, for being distracted trying to find attractions such as "the world's largest ball of twine" on their way to their actual destination, the fictional amusement park called "Wally World".
*The [[Adventure Game]] [[Sam and Max Hit the Road]] largely takes place at a series of tourist traps across the United States.
