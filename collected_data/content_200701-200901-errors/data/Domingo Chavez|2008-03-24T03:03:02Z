'''Domingo "Ding" Chavez''' is a [[fictional character]] described as a "passionate Latino" by American author [[Tom Clancy]] and appearing in many of his [[novel]]s and [[video game]]s. 

==History==
Born in the [[barrio]] of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], date of birth [[January 12]], 1968. Domingo was first recruited to be a member of a secret [[CIA]]-run anti-drug operation in Colombia in ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'', while he was still a sergeant in the [[U.S. Army]]. He first met [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]] during this novel and has worked with him since. He has at least two advanced degrees and is fluent in English, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, and Persian: in ''[[Debt of Honor]],'' he is under cover as a [[Russia]]n reporter. He is married to John Clark's daughter, Patricia, and they have a child, John Conor Chavez. He, along with Clark, rescued a [[Japan]]ese [[politics|politician]] who was former prime minister (and later re-elected) in ''[[Debt of Honor]]''. Soon after the events in the Japanese conflict, Domingo worked again with John Clark in implementing "Plan Blue" (recruitment of law enforcement officers as intelligence officers) during ''Executive Orders,'' some inside [[Iran]]. Clark and Chavez lead multiple operations for President Ryan in this novel, some inside [[Iran]]. He later was recruited into and became a team leader (with the rank of major) in the multinational counterterrorist organization [[Rainbow Six (computer game)#Team Rainbow|RAINBOW]] in ''[[Rainbow Six (novel)|Rainbow Six]]'', which defeated several terrorist groups and prevented a [[bioterrorism]] plague. He later became "Rainbow Six" himself in the later [[Rainbow Six]] video games, such as [[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas]]. The position was formerly held by his father-in-law, John Clark.

==Career==
Ding was formerly part of the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, [[U.S. 7th Infantry Division]], which had the [[motto]], "Ninja! We own the night." In ''Clear and Present Danger'', he carries ninja [[Shuriken|throwing stars]] (as a lucky charm).  Before his operation in Colombia, he says "We (ninjas) own the night", before he "kills" an "enemy" jungle-warfare instructor.

Domingo is known to possess at least 3 [[Intelligence Star]]s; one issued at the beginning of ''[[Debt of Honor]]'' after a successful operation in East Africa, one issued for John Clark and Domingo during the Japanese conflict (see ''[[Debt of Honor]]'' for the conflict; notice of issue in ''[[Executive Orders]]'') as well as one for his ongoing operations carried out in ''[[Executive Orders]]'' (noted during ''[[Rainbow Six]]'' as [[Golovko]] reviews his file 'thought to possess no less than 2 [[Intelligence Star]]s'). These awards—generally given for valor in [[black operation]]s that officially "never happened"—are awarded secretly, and no medals or ribbons are worn: their existence is [[classified]].
