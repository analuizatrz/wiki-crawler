'''Kaziranga National Park''' ([[Assamese]]: কাজিৰঙা ৰাষ্ট্ৰীয় উদ্যান, [[IAST]]: kājirangā jātiya uddyāna, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{Audio|Kaziranga-pronounce.ogg|/kaziɹɔŋa ɹastɹijɔ udːjan/}}) is an [[India]]n [[National park of India|national park]] and a [[World Heritage Site]] in [[Golaghat district|Golaghat]] and [[Nagaon district]]s of [[Assam]], [[India]]. Two-thirds of the world's [[one-horned rhinoceros|Great One-horned Rhinoceros]]es live in the park.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6564337.stm |work=BBC News |title=Assam rhino poaching 'spirals' |author=Bhaumik, Subir |date=[[17 April]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> Kaziranga has the highest density of [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s among [[protected area]]s in the World and was declared a [[Tiger Reserve]] in 2006. The park has large breeding populations of [[Asian Elephant|Elephant]], [[Asiatic Water Buffalo|Water Buffalo]] and [[Swamp Deer]]. Kaziranga is recognized as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[Birdlife International]] for conservation of avifaunal species. The park has achieved notable progress in [[wildlife conservation]] with respect to other protected areas in [[India]].

Kaziranga is a vast stretch of tall [[elephant grass]], [[marshland]] and dense [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]] crisscrossed by four main rivers — [[Brahmaputra river|Brahmaputra]], [[River Diphlu|Diphlu]], [[River Mora Diphlu|Mora Diphlu]] and [[River Mora Dhansiri|Mora Dhansiri]] and has numerous [[beel|small water bodies]]. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, documentaries and songs. The park celebrated its centenary in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a [[reserve forest]]. 

Kaziranga is one of the largest tracts of protected land in the sub-Himalayan belt, and due to its high species diversity and presence of high-visibility species, has been described as a "[[biodiversity hotspot]]".<ref>{{cite news

Local legend tells about a village girl named Ranga and a young man named Kazi from [[Karbi Anglong District|Karbi Anglong]] who fell in love. Their parents would not give consent to the affair, so the couple continued to meet each other in the forest. One day, they went into the forest and never returned. Since that day, the people call the forest Kaziranga.<ref>{{cite web | title = Kaziranga National Park-Myth and Mysteries | publisher = Kaziranga National Park Authorities | url= http://www.kaziranga100.com/Myth.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-23 }} </ref>

Based on [[Landsat]] data for 1986, coverage by different vegetation is as follows: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%.<ref  name="kushwaha">Kushwaha, S.& Unni, M.

Grasslands dominate the western reaches of the park which are typically at a lower altitude than the eastern end, with tall elephant grass on the higher ground while the short grasses cover the lower grounds surrounding the bheels or flood created ponds.<ref name = "un"/> Annual flooding, grazing by herbivores  and [[controlled burn]]ing maintains and fertilizes the grasslands and reeds.

Numerous [[forb]]s are present along with the grasses. Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees —- dominant species include ''[[Careya arborea]], [[Phyllanthus emblica|Emblica officinalis]]'', the [[cotton]] tree or ''[[Bombax ceiba]]'' (in savanna woodlands), and ''[[Dillenia]] indica'' (in inundated grasslands).<ref name = "un"/> 

Impenetrable evergreen forests, near Kanchanjhuri, Panbari and Tamulipathar blocks, contain trees such as ''[[Aphanamixis polystachya]], [[Talauma]] hodgsonii, Dillenia indica, [[Garcinia]] tinctoria, [[Ficus]] rumphii, [[Cinnamomum]] bejolghota'', and species of [[Syzygium]]. Tropical semi-evergreen forests are present near Baguri, Bimali and Haldibari. Common trees and shrubs are ''[[Albizia]] procera, [[Duabanga]] grandiflora, [[Lagerstroemia speciosa]], [[Crateva]] unilocularis, [[Sterculia]] urens, [[Grewia]] serrulata, [[Mallotus (plant)|Mallotus]] philippensis, [[Bridelia]] retusa, [[Aphania]] rubra, [[Leea]] indica'' and ''Leea umbraculifera''.<ref> Jain, S.K. and Sastry, A.R.K.

The Kaziranga National Park has been granted the maximum protection under Indian law for the conservation of wildlife. Twelve acts including the ''Assam Forest Regulation of 1891'' and the ''Biodiversity Conservation Act of 2002'' are in effect for wildlife protection of the park.<ref name="unsummary"/> Poaching, particularly rhinoceroses for its horn, has been a major concern for the authorities. Between 1980 and 2005, 567 rhinoceroses were hunted by poachers.<ref name="unescotech"/> Preventive measures such as maintenance of existing and construction of new anti-poaching camps, patrolling, intelligence gathering and control over the use of firearms around the park have reduced numbers.<ref name="kazihero">{{cite web| title = Kaziranga National Park-Heroes of Kaziranga | publisher = Kaziranga National Park Authorities| url=  http://www.kaziranga100.com/The%20Heroes.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-23 }}</ref><ref name=telegraph070424>{{cite news

[[Image:Kazi fire.jpg|thumb|Controlled burning of grass in Kaziranga]]
Perennial flooding and heavy rains have resulted in the death of wild animals and damage to the conservation infrastructures.<ref name="unescoreport"/> To escape the water-logged areas, many animals migrate to elevated regions outside the park boundaries where they are susceptible to hunting, hit by speeding vehicles, or by reprisals by villagers for damaging crops.<ref name="kazi100"/> To mitigate the losses, the authorities have increased patrols, purchased additional speedboats for patrol, and created artificial highlands for shelter.<ref name="kazi100"/> Several corridors have been set up for the safe crossing of animals across National Highway–37 which skirts around the southern boundary of the park.<ref name="highway">Bonal, BS & Chowdhury, S (2004), ''Evaluation of barrier effect of National Highway37 on the wildlife of Kaziranga National Park and suggested strategies and planning for providing passage: A feasibility report to the Ministry of Environment & Forests'', Government of India.</ref> To prevent the spreading of diseases and maintaining the genetic distinctness of the wild species, systematic steps such as immunization of livestock in surrounding villages, and the fencing the sensitive areas of the park susceptible to encroachment by local cattle are undertaken periodically.<ref name="kazi100"/>

Water pollution by way of run-offs from pesticides from tea gardens, and a petroleum refinery at [[Numaligarh]] are posing a hazard to the ecology of the region.<ref name="unescotech"/> Invasive species such as [[Mimosa]] and wild rose have posed a threat to the native plants in the region. To control growth and irradiation of invasive species, research on biological methods for controlling the weeds, manual uprooting and weeding before seed settling are carried out at regular intervals.<ref name="kazi100"/> Grassland management techniques like [[controlled burning]] are effected annually to avoid [[forest fire]]s.<ref name="un"/>
