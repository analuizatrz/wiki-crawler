'''"Ulysses"''' is a poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] (1809–1892), the noted [[Victorian era|Victorian]] poet, published in 1842. In the poem, Ulysses describes his discontent and restlessness after returning to his kingdom; he yearns to explore again, despite his long-desired reunion with his wife [[Penelope]] and his son [[Telemachus]].

Many authors, such as [[Dante]] and [[Shakespeare]], have written about Ulysses since the character first appeared in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' (c. 800–600 [[Anno Domini|BC]]). Tennyson's Ulysses resembles [[Dante]]'s, who is condemned to hell for his zealous pursuit of knowledge at others' expense. 

For most of the poem's history, an affirmative reading of its themes prevailed; the heroic, resolute Ulysses was admired for his determination "to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield".<ref>Pettigrew, 28.</ref> This, the poem's last line, has become a popular quotation. Scholars have since offered more nuanced interpretations of the poem, arguing, for example, that the poem contains important [[irony|ironies]].

"Ulysses"'s seventy lines of [[blank verse]] are presented as a [[dramatic monologue]]; the poem's forceful and unadorned language expresses Ulysses' conflicting moods in [[iambic pentameter]]. The use of [[spondee]]s and [[pyrrhic]]s interrupts the insistent [[meter (poetry)|meter]], and the many [[enjambment|enjambed]] lines in the monologue hint at Ulysses' restlessness.

As the poem begins, Ulysses ([[Odysseus]] in Greek<ref>The word "Ulysses" (more correctly "Ulixes") is the Latin form of the Greek "[[Odysseus]]", source of the word "odyssey".</ref>) has returned to his kingdom of Ithaca after fighting in the Trojan War and his long, eventful journey home. Ulysses describes his lack of contentment with domestic life, including his alienation from the "savage race" that he governs. The narrator seems to carefully choose his tone to reinforce his sophistication and rank.<ref>Campbell, 132.</ref> Ulysses contrasts his restlessness and boredom with his heroic past. He values experience and the knowledge gained from it, and asserts the dullness of "pausing". He contemplates his age and eventual death—"Life piled on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains". The king next speaks of his son Telemachus, inheritor of the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks Telemachus will be an adequate king, he has little empathy for his son—"He works his work, I mine"—and the necessary methods of governing—"by slow prudence" and "through soft degrees". In the final verse, Ulysses turns his attention to his mariners and calls on them to join him on another quest.

Tennyson completed the poem by [[October 20]], [[1833]],<ref>Tennyson, A. T., & Day, A. (1991), 360.</ref> but it was not published until 1842 in his second collection of ''Poems''. Unlike many of Tennyson's other important poems, "Ulysses" was not revised after its publication.<!--Cressman--> It has, however, been printed with both three and four paragraphs. With three paragraphs, the poem is divided at lines 33 and 44; with four, the five-line introduction becomes its own movement. Tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs, a structure that affects the analysis of Ulysses' narration. In the four-movement version, the first and third are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior [[monologue]]s, respectively.<ref>Pettigrew, 41.</ref>

== Interpretations ==

=== Autobiographical elements ===

Tennyson penned "Ulysses" after the death of his close Cambridge friend, [[Arthur Henry Hallam]] (1811–1833), a friendship he considered glamorous and glorious. The two friends had spent much time discussing the nature of poetry and truth and writing verse together. Together they traveled to [[southern France]], the [[Pyrenees]], and Germany. Many thought that Hallam, a gifted young poet, was destined for greatness, perhaps as a statesman.<ref>Hughes, 197.</ref> 

When he heard on [[October 1]], [[1833]] of his friend's death, Tennyson was living in [[Somersby, Lincolnshire|Somersby]], [[Lincolnshire]], in close quarters with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to move home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson's friends became increasingly concerned about his mental and physical health during this time. The family had little income, and two of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. As Tennyson's outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam's death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, [[Emilia Tennyson|Emily]], who had lost her fiance.

The emotional gulf between the state of his domestic affairs and the loss of his special friendship informs the reading of "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity.<ref>Hughes.</ref> At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror Tennyson's, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by traveling again. Tennyson said that the poem "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life".<ref>Quoted in Tennyson, A. T., & Roberts, A. (2000), 567.</ref>  It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth.<ref>Hughes, 199.</ref> "There is more about myself in ''Ulysses'', which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of [Hallam's] loss upon me than many poems in ''In Memoriam''."<ref>Quoted in Hughes, 195.</ref> Tennyson memorialized Hallam in another of his most highly regarded poems, ''[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]'', completed seventeen years later.

Yet W. W. Robson and others have found stylistic incongruities between the poem and poet: "Tennyson, the responsible social being, the admirably serious and 'committed' individual, is uttering strenuous sentiments in the accent of Tennyson the most un-strenuous, lonely and poignant of poets."<ref>Robson, W. W. (1960). "The Dilemma of Tennyson". In Killham (1960), 159.</ref>

=== Literary context ===
 
[[Image:Blake Dante Hell XXVI Ulisses.jpg|thumb|150px|One of [[William Blake|William Blake's]] watercolors illustrating [[Dante|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]''; here, [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and [[Diomedes]] are condemned to hell.]]

Many poets wrote about Ulysses, among them Homer, [[Euripides]], [[Horace]], [[Dante]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Alexander Pope]].  Tennyson's poem is considered the first modern account of Ulysses.<ref>Stanford, 202.</ref> In the twentieth century, [[James Joyce|James Joyce's]] novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and [[Ezra Pound|Ezra Pound's]] poem ''[[The Cantos]]'' invoked the character.

Classics scholar [[W. B. Stanford]] surveyed Ulysses in literature and found that Tennyson adopts  aspects of the character from many sources.<ref>Stanford, 202.</ref> Homer's ''Odyssey'' provides the narrative background, but Tennyson's Ulysses is not the lover of public affairs of Homer's poems. Rather, Dante's "Ulisse" from the ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' is Tennyson's main source for the character.<ref>Pettigrew, 31.</ref> Dante tells the story of Ulisse in the ''Inferno'''s 26th [[canto]], where he is condemned to the eighth circle of hell for using his gift of reason for evil. To Dante, Ulysses, with his "zeal…/T'explore the world", is an evil counselor<!--"counselor"? odd diction. :yup, seen repeatedly--> who lusts for adventure at the expense of his family and his duties in Ithaca.<ref>Rowlinson (1994), 241.</ref> Tennyson projects this "zeal" into Ulysses' unquenched desire for knowledge:<ref>Schwarz, 39.</ref> <!--According to the legend recounted in the ''Inferno'', Ulysses perishes at sea before returning to Ithaca. In the Homeric narrative, Ulysses' travels end in Ithaca, him having lost his mariners at sea—which puts the two narratives in contradiction.-->  
<poem>
     And this gray spirit yearning in desire
     To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
     Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
</poem>

Critics have noted the influence of Shakespeare in two passages. In the early movement, the savage race "that hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me" echoes [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet's]] [[soliloquy]]: "What is a man, / If his chief good and market of his time / Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more."<ref>IV, iv. 32 ff., quoted in Bush, Douglas (Jan 1943). "Tennyson's 'Ulysses' and 'Hamlet'." ''The Modern Language Review'', 38(1), 38.</ref> Tennyson's "How dull it is pause, to make an end, / to rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use!" recalls Shakespeare's Ulysses in ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'':<ref>''Troilus and Cressida'', Act III, Scene III, quoted in Stanford, 203.</ref>

<poem>
                  perserverance, my dear lord,
     Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
     Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail,
     In monumental mockery.
</poem>

The decisive influence of Dante is asserted with the arrival of the last movement, according to Stanford.  Ulysses turns his attention from himself and speaks of ports, broad seas, and his mariners. Calling his men to join him on one last adventure, he recalls the last words of Dante's character.<!--which ought to be inserted here--> The strains of discontent and weakness in old age remain throughout the poem, but Tennyson leaves Ulysses to "strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield", recalling the Dantesque infernal desire for knowledge. <!-- ok too big a statement: This modern Ulysses looks toward a new age of scientific optimism and colonialism.<ref>Stanford, 204.</ref> -->

According to critic Matthew Rowlinson, "Ulysses" is an argument for continuation of narrative in a textual tradition, and a "meditation on the ground of that continuity".<ref>Rowlinson (1994), 122.</ref> The narrator asserts the inseparability of Ulysses, the person, with his name. Ulysses says, "I am become a name…I am a part of all that I have met" in successive sentences and in parallel clauses. He speaks in the fictional time of Homer’s Ulysses, but his claim is also that of Tennyson’s text, existing in another temporal order, and therefore refers to his fame ''extending from'' the Homeric and other works about him.

=== Ulysses as narrator ===

The degree to which Tennyson identifies with Ulysses is one of the great debates among scholars of the poem.<ref>Hughes.</ref> If Tennyson endorses the speaker, the speech may be read without [[irony]]; if the poet departs from this identification, alternative readings present themselves. Tennyson discouraged an autobiographical interpretation of his monologues,<ref>Campbell, 130.</ref> but critics have examined "Ulysses" for signs of its author. Until the early twentieth century, readers reacted to the poem sympathetically. The meaning of the poem was increasingly debated as Tennyson's stature rose.<ref>Hughes, 200.</ref> 

Key to the straightforward reading of "Ulysses" is the biographical context of the poem.  Such a reading takes into account Tennyson's statements about writing the poem, and considers that he would not undermine Ulysses' determination with irony when he needed a similar stalwartness to face life after Hallam's death.<ref>Hughes, 194.</ref>

After Paull F. Baum argued in 1948 that Ulysses recalls [[Milton|Milton's]] Satan in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'',<ref>Baum, P. F. (1948). ''Tennyson sixty years after.'' Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press. Cited in Hughes (1979).</ref> the ironic interpretation became dominant. Ulysses' apparent disdain for those around him is one facet of the ironic perspective. Ulysses declares that he is "matched with an aged wife"; indicates his weariness in governing a "savage race"; and suggests his philosophical distance from his son Telemachus. A stronger<!--"stronger"? stronger than what? diction could be more precise--> reading of the third movement finds it a condescending tribute to Telemachus and a rejection of his "slow prudence". However, the adjectives used to describe Telemachus—"blameless", "discerning", and "decent"—are words with positive connotations in other of Tennyson's poetry and within the classical tradition.<ref>Hughes, 194.</ref> 

E. J. Chiasson argued in 1954 that Tennyson was affirming the need for religious faith by showing how Ulysses' unfaithfulness led to his neglect of kingdom and family. He found the poem "intractable" in Tennyson's canon—its interpretation being something of a sport—but the poem resolves itself when its "method of indirection" is understood. Ulysses is scornful—like Tennyson's [[Tithonus]] and the mariners of "[[The Lotos-Eaters]]"—and he illustrates Tennyson's conviction that "disregarding religious sanctions and 'submitting all things to desire' leads to either a [[wikt:sybaritic|sybaritic]] or a brutal repudiation of responsibility and 'life'."<ref>E. J. Chiasson, "Tennyson's 'Ulysses'—A Re-Interpretation". In Killham (1960), 164–173.</ref>

Other ironic readings have connected Ulysses to [[Byronic hero]]es such as [[Childe Harold]], or found him longing for withdrawal, even death, in the form of his proposed quest. In the Homeric narrative, Ulysses' mariners, whom he calls on—"Come, my friends, / 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world"—are dead, a fact that encourages psychological readings.

=== The dramatic monologue ===

Scholars disagree about how "Ulysses" functions as a [[dramatic monologue]]; it is not necessarily clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a [[soliloquy]] to a public address as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first two movements, then turn to an audience as he introduces his son, then relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners.<ref>Hughes, 201.</ref> In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first two movements is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the third paragraph about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a "revised version [of the first movement fit] for public consumption".<ref>Pettigrew, 41.</ref>

The sense of passivity found in "Ulysses" opposes the archetype of Ulysses as adventurer. [[T. S. Eliot]] opined that "Tennyson could not tell a story at all". To him, Dante's treatment of Ulysses is exciting, while Tennyson's piece is "an [[elegiac]] mood".<ref>T. S. Eliot, "In Memoriam". In Killham (1960), 210.</ref> "Ulysses" is not a narrative of action; the hero's goal is vague, and by the poem's famous last line, it is not clear for what he is "striving", or to what he refuses to "yield". According to Herbert Tucker, Tennyson’s characters "move" through time and space to be moved inwardly. To Ulysses, experience is "somewhere out there", "an arch wherethrough / Gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades / Forever and forever when I move."<ref>Tucker, 11.</ref> The senses of desire and vague movement in "Ulysses" reinforce the [[etymological]] connection between "passion" and "passivity".

==Legacy and references in culture==

=== Canonization ===

The contemporary reviews of Tennyson's 1842 volume of ''Poems'' were positive and found no hint of irony in it. That year, author [[John Sterling (author)|John Sterling]] (a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]] along with Tennyson) wrote of "Ulysses", "There is in this work a delightful epic tone, and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble."<ref>Quoted in Storch, 282.</ref> Renowned Scottish writer [[Thomas Carlyle]] appreciated the poem, but goaded Tennyson to apply Ulysses' convictions to his own life. [[Richard Holt Hutton]]<!--tell the reader who this is in a phrase--> summarized "Ulysses" as "[Tennyson's] friendly picture of the insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when under the control of a luminous reason and a self-controlled will."<ref>Quoted in Storch, 283.</ref> 

R. F. Storch examined how Victorian culture shaped the era's response to the poem's two conflicting themes of domestic servitude and individualism. He concluded that the Victorian era's moral sensibility "moved along other lines", such that Ulysses' rejection of family and society did not produce a moral conflict for the reader.<ref>Storch (1971).</ref>

"Ulysses" was well-received, but its inclusion within the Tennyson canon was not immediate. Reviewing the history of its publication in anthologies, Rowlinson (1992) observed that "Ulysses" was not usually among the poems Tennyson selected for his public readership. In teaching anthologies, however, the poem was<!--"is" as well?--> usually included. The prominence of "Ulysses" in Tennyson's canon is a result of two trends: the rise of formal [[Literary criticism|English poetry studies]] in the late nineteenth century and the Victorian effort to articulate an English culture that could be exported.<ref>Rowlinson (1992).</ref>  Though "Ulysses" offers no overt imperialism, some of Tennyson's later poetry argues for the value of Britain's colonies, for example, his epilogue to ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' (1873).<ref>Rowlinson (1992), 268.</ref>

The twentieth century brought with it a skepticism of the narratorial voice and a willingness to explore meaning beyond the [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]]. Still, "Ulysses" remains a much-admired poem.<ref>Pettigrew, 27.</ref> Professor of literature [[Basil Willey]] commented in 1956, "In 'Ulysses' the sense that he must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively, through the classical story, and not subjectively as his own experience. He comes here as near perfection in the grand manner as he ever did; the poem is flawless in tone from beginning to end; spare, grave, free from excessive decoration, and full of firmly controlled feeling."<ref>Quoted in Storch, 283.</ref> 

=== In poetry ===

In a 1929 essay, [[T. S. Eliot]] called "Ulysses" a "perfect poem",<ref>T. S. Eliot (1950). ''Selected essays, 1917-1932.'' New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 210. ISBN 0151803870.</ref> while noting that Tennyson's achievement is the result of "forcing".<!--forcing what? it's poetry, read into it as you will!--> An analogue of Ulysses is found in Eliot's "[[Gerontion]]" (1920).<ref>Fulweiler, 170.</ref> Both poems are narrated by an aged man contemplating life's end.  Comparing "Ulysses"' introductory lines, Eliot's comment on Ulysses is ironic:

<poem>
     Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.
     The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,
     Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.

                 I am an old man,	 
     A dull head among windy places. (12–16)
</poem>

Italian poet [[Giovanni Pascoli]] (1855-1912) stated that his long lyric poem ''L'ultimo viaggio'' was an attempt to reconcile the portrayals of Ulysses in Dante and Tennyson with the prophecy that Ulysses would die "a mild death off the sea."<ref>Stanford, 205.</ref> Ulysses leaves Ithaca to retrace his epic voyage rather than begin another.  [[Arturo Graf]] (1848–1913), a contemporary of Pascoli, wrote "L'ultimo viaggio di Ulisse" with the more familiar echo of Dante's heroic character.

=== Other references ===

Many readers have accepted the acclaimed last lines of the poem as inspirational, despite other interpretations which question Ulysses' bravery:

<poem>
     One equal temper of heroic hearts,
     Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
     To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
</poem>

Antarctic explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and his party died on their return voyage from the South Pole in 1912. A cross memorializing them on [[Observation Hill (McMurdo Station)|Observation Hill]] is inscribed with "Ulysses"' last line. In the series finale of the television sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', entitled "[[Goodnight, Seattle]]", psychiatrist [[Frasier Crane]] quotes the end of the poem in his farewell speech.
