'''Texada Island''' is the largest island in the [[Strait of Georgia]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Its northern tip is located about {{convert|8|km|mi}} southwest of the city of [[Powell River, British Columbia|Powell River]] in the [[Powell River Regional District, British Columbia|Powell River Regional District]] on the [[Sunshine Coast]]. A former mining and logging area, the island still has a few quarries and old logging roads. It is the largest of the Northern [[Gulf Islands]] at some {{convert|50|km|mi}} in length and {{convert|10|km|mi}} in width. It sits beside [[Lasqueti Island|Lasqueti]], [[Jedediah Island|Jedediah]], [[Harwood Island (British Columbia)|Harwood]] and [[Nelson Island (British Columbia)|Nelson Islands]]. [[Hernando Island|Hernando]] and [[Savary Island|Savary Islands]] complete the mini-archipelago.

==History==
Texada was named by the Spanish naval explorer [[José María Narváez]] for [[Felix de Tejada]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[rear-admiral]]<ref>{{BCGNIS|15098|Texada Island}}</ref> during the 1791 expedition of [[Francisco de Eliza]]. Narváez gave the name ''Isla de Texada'' to what is now called [[Lasqueti Island]], and ''Islas de San Felix'' to Texada Island. The maps made by Eliza and [[Juan Carrasco (explorer)|Juan Carrasco]] in late 1791 moved the name "Texada" to the present Texada Island.<ref>{{cite book |last= McDowell |first= Jim |title= José Narváez: The Forgotten Explorer |year= 1998 |publisher= The Arthur H. Clark Company |location= Spokane, Washington |isbn= 0-87062-265-X |pages= pp. 58-59}}</ref> A century later the north end of the island became a fishing outport. For a few years, humpback whales were flensed on the beach, giving the place the epitaph of Blubber Bay. Grey Whales migrating from California to Alaska pass by Texada Island. Twelve [[basking sharks]] were slaughtered as sport in Blubber Bay in 1947.

According to legend, Native [[Sliammon]] people did not inhabit Texada, as they fear the island will sink into the strait. They did use the island to fish and clam.

In 1876, a whaler called Harry Trim discovered iron ore, and mining began in earnest.Iron mines were explored and floated in 1876, with Premier [[Amor de Cosmos]] being involved in a land and mine scandal. The iron was used off and on--some going into Seattle built battleships, the [[USS Oregon (BB-3)|USS ''Oregon'']], for the [[Great White Fleet]]; gold mining was also important. 

Copper was discovered at Van Anda about 1898, with the Copper Queen mine and the Cornell mine started. A smelter, tramway and town was constructed. The community was named after [[Van Anda Blewett]], son of American mining capitalist Edward [[Blewett, Washington|Blewett]], (who in turn named a town with the surname in Washington State). [[J. D. Rockefeller]] invested in the iron mines, though he quickly sold having lost money on a [[Monte Cristo, Washington]] venture near [[Everett]]. The iron mines were picked up by the famed [[Union Iron Works]] of San Francisco. Canadian investors Sir [[William Mackenzie]] and [[Donald Mann]] also speculated in the Van Anda mines. Farms, orchards, logging and a sawmill were set up on Texada at this time as well. By the turn of the century, the copper boom was in full swing but the mines only yielded for a few years. Van Anda hosted an opera house and a [[Chinatown]]. A series of fires demolished the Van Anda townsite -- the last in 1917.  Sail races were run from Vancouver to Van Anda about this time too.

However, by 1910, Pacific Lime Company and BC Cement had set up limestone quarrying operations at Blubber Bay and Marble Bay. For almost a century, limestone quarrying continued. Much of the product was shipped to [[Seattle]], [[Oregon]] or California. [[Railways]], cableways and concentration plants were built for the mines, as was the [[arbutus]]-shaded company town of Blubber Bay. [[Limestone]] pits were dug all around the north section of the island so that it more resembles a slice of [[Swiss cheese]] than a land mass. Lime kilns for sintering quicklime were raised around the northern end of the island.
One survives at Marble Bay, and the name is given to Lime Kiln Bay. Other mines included an [[iron ore]] mine near Gillies Bay run by [[Kaiser Aluminum]] which shipped ore to Japan and Germany after 1945.

Coastal ferries connected the island with the nearby cities of [[Vancouver]] and [[Nanaimo]]. The [[Union Steamship Company]] ''[[Cheslakee]]'' capsized off Van Anda with a loss of life in 1913. While the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] maintained a mission boat for the coast based from Van Anda, and the Rev. G. Pringle noted "that for many years his wife kept an oil burning lamp in his window as the only beacon to guide navigators of boats big or small into the rocky bay. I have been through the [Great] War, but some of my experiences afloat, or ashore, in storm or fog, along this coast, tried me as much, so for as a strain on my nerves was concerned, as those wretched days of Lens or [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]."  The head of the Mission, John Antle, preached for a while in [[Roslyn, Washington]], very near Blewett, so the connections are many. A floating hospital was built by Columbia Coast Mission Boats and moored at Van Anda, until its need was greater in [[Knight Inlet]] and was moved.

During [[prohibition|U.S. prohibition]], the island was a supply point for illegal alcohol into the [[United States]], with a famous illegal distillery operating on the east shore. The remains of the [[hooch]] boiler can be seen on the beach. Blubber Bay quarries were the scene of a vicious strike in 1938.

Logging and [[cement]] production continue to this day. Incidentally, the tug ''[[Manson (tugboat)|Manson]]'' sank off Texada Island with loss of all hands.

==Today== 
A regular [[BC Ferries|ferry]] service links [[Powell River, British Columbia|Powell River]] and the main ferry terminal at [[Blubber Bay, British Columbia|Blubber Bay]]. 
Interestingly, the first ferry to the island, after the discontinued Union steamships run, was the Atrevida, late of [[October Ferry to Gabriola]] fame.The island also has two stores, a library, bank, gas station, hotel, bed and breakfasts, newly-built restaurant, a museum and a post office. Located near Gillies Bay, Texada Island also has a 3000' paved runway CYGB for private aircraft and scheduled services. Texada Island is used in a computer flight simulator
program (Link Below). There are many parks, forests, lakes, beaches and mountains to explore. There are rare fossils, abundant plant life and a variety of wildlife. South Texada Island Provincial Park and Shelter Point Park are two wonderful areas. If travelling to the south end, lookout for hillbuggies, or homegrown [[soapbox car]]s.

Texada possesses a wonderful combination of light and soil conditions for market agriculture. Large vegetables
have been known to grow on the island.  Today, the island caters mainly to weekending tourists seeking an escape from the city.
A [[Jazz]] festival and a [[sandcastle]] contest are held in the summer. 

A [[BC Hydro]] [[powerline]] that was built in 1982 runs east-west across the middle of the Island, linking two sections of underwater transmission line that deliver power to Vancouver Island. A [[Terasen Gas]] natural gas pipeline, built in 1989, runs from south to north, where it splits, providing gas to Powell River and Vancouver Island. The island still produces 5 million tons of limestone a year. The island is 300.45 km² (116 sq mi) in land area and had a population of 1,129 in the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 census]].

==LNG Controversy== 
In 2007, [http://www.westpaclng.com/ Westpac LNG] announced that it intended to build a [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) receiving terminal, and a gas-fired electricity generation project, at Kiddie Point on the north end of Texada. Controversy surrounding the project ramped up quickly: the year also witnessed the re-introduction of [http://www.texadaactionnow.org Texada Action Now] by Texada residents, and the formation of the [http://www.texadalng.com Alliance to Stop LNG], comprising a large number of conservation, environmental, community and labour groups around the Georgia Basin.
