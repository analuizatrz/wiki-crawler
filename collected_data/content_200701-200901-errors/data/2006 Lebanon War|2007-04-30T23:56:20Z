The conflict started on [[12 July]] [[2006]], and continued until a [[United Nations]]-brokered ceasefire went into effect on [[14 August]] [[2006]], though it formally ended on [[8 September]] [[2006]] when Israel lifted their naval blockade of Lebanon.

The conflict began after Hezbollah fired [[Katyusha|Katyusha rockets]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] at Israeli border villages, diverting attention from another Hezbollah unit that crossed the border, kidnapping two Israeli soldiers and killing three others. Israeli troops attempted to rescue the abducted soldiers but were unsuccessful, losing five more in the attempt. Another five soldiers and five civilians were wounded in the attacks. Israel responded with massive [[airstrike]]s and [[artillery]] fire on targets in Lebanon,<ref name="amos_haaretz" /> which damaged Lebanese [[civilian infrastructure]], including Beirut's [[Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport|Rafic Hariri International Airport]] which Israel said Hezbollah used to import weapons, an air and naval [[blockade]],<ref>{{cite web

== Background ==
{{main|Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
Prior to the conflict, Lebanon had long failed to control militancy within its borders, and Israel had a history of using force in Lebanon in response to militant attacks. The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) had committed cross-border attacks from [[southern Lebanon]] into Israel as far back as 1968, and the area became a significant base following the arrival of the PLO leadership and its [[Fatah]] brigade after their 1971 [[Black September in Jordan|expulsion from Jordan]]. This situation exacerbated [[Demographics of Lebanon|demographic tensions]] over the Lebanese [[National Pact]] which divided governmental powers among religious groups, leading in part to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975-1990). Concurrently, Syria began a [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|29 year military occupation]]. Israel's [[Operation Litani|1978 invasion of Lebanon]] failed to stem the Palestinian attacks, but [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]] again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO.<ref name="Encarta: PLO">{{cite web

Combat with Hezbollah weakened Israeli resolve and led to a collapse of the SLA and an early Israeli withdrawal in 2000 to their side of the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|UN designated border]]. Citing Israeli control of the disputed [[Shebaa farms]] region and the incarceration of [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel]], Hezbollah continued cross border attacks, and successfully used the tactic of abducting soldiers from Israel as leverage for a [[Israeli MIA prisoner exchanges|prisoner exchange]] in [[2004]],<ref name="Institute for Palestinian Studies">{{cite web

At around 9:00 AM local time (06:00 [[UTC]]) on [[12 July]] [[2006]], Hezbollah launched [[Feint|diversionary]] rocket attacks toward Israeli military positions near the coast and near the border village of [[Zar'it]]<ref name=unreport>{{cite news | title= Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for the period from 21 January 2006 to 18 July 2006 | date=July 21 2006 | publisher=[[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] | url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.NSF/fd807e46661e3689852570d00069e918/87e2508779d8ec83852571b6004c761f}}</ref> as well as on the Israeli town of [[Shlomi]] and other villages.<ref>{{cite news | title= Day-by-day: Lebanon crisis - week one

Hezbollah named the attack "[[Zar'it-Shtula incident|Operation Truthful Promise]]" after leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]]'s public pledges over the prior year and a half to abduct Israeli soldiers and swap them for convicted murderer [[Samir Kuntar]], convicted spy [[Nasim Nisr]], alleged terrorist [[Yahya Skaf]] whom Hezbollah claims was arrested in Israel (Israel denies this), and [[Ali Faratan]], who is being held for reasons unknown.<ref name=nasrallah>{{cite web

The UN observer reportedly wrote that previous Israeli bombing near the post had not been deliberate targeting, but rather due to "tactical necessity," military jargon which retired Canadian Major General [[Lewis MacKenzie]] later interpreted as indicating that Israeli strikes were aimed at Hezbollah targets extremely close to the post.

{{seealso|Siniora Plan|Foreign relations of Lebanon}}

While Israel initially held the Lebanese government responsible for the Hezbollah attacks due to Lebanon's failure to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559|Resolution 1559]] and disarm Hezbollah, Lebanon disavowed the raids, stating that the government of Lebanon did not condone them, and that Israel had its own history of disregarding inconvenient UN resolutions.<ref name=Lebanon2 />

=== Intentional attacks on civilians ===
{{main|Targeting of civilian areas in the 2006 Lebanon War}}

One of the most controversial aspects of the conflict has been the high number of civilian deaths. The exact number of civilian deaths and the responsibility for them is hotly disputed.

Amnesty International called on Hezbollah to end its attacks on civilians, and for Israel to end its attacks against both civilians and civilian objects.<ref>Amnesty International (July 13, 2006).

On [[24 July]] [[2006]], U.N. humanitarian chief [[Jan Egeland]] said Israel's response violated international humanitarian law, but also criticized Hezbollah for knowingly putting civilians in harm's way by "cowardly blending...among women and children".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,205352,00.html|title=U.N.

In response to some of this criticism, Israel has stated that it did, wherever possible, attempt to distinguish between protected persons and combatants, but that due to Hezbollah militants being in civilian clothing this was not always possible.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

=== Intentional attacks on civilian objects ===
{{main|Targeting of civilian areas in the 2006 Lebanon War}}

Direct attacks on civilian objects are prohibited under international humanitarian law.<ref name="AI_dmg"/> The [[United Nations Development Program]] The [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) initially estimated about 35,000 homes and businesses in Lebanon were destroyed by Israel in the conflict, while a quarter of the country's road bridges or overpasses were damaged. Jean Fabre, a UNDP spokesman, estimated that overall economic losses for Lebanon from the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah totaled "at least $15 billion, if not more."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=3&article_id=74944|title=War wiped out 15 years of Lebanese recovery - UNDP|publisher=Dailystar| accessdate = 2006-08-24

Amnesty International published a report identifying evidence of the destruction of entire civilian neighbourhoods and villages by Israeli forces, attacks on bridges with no strategic value, and attacks on civilian infrastructure indispensable to the survival of the civilian population.<ref name="AI_evidence">{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE020182006|title=Israel-Lebanon Evidence indicates deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure|date=[[2006-08-23]]|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]}}</ref> It stated that "the widespread destruction of apartments, houses, electricity and water services, roads, bridges, factories and ports, in addition to several statements by Israeli officials, suggests a policy of punishing both the Lebanese government and the civilian population," and called for an international investigation of violations of international humanitarian law by both sides in the conflict.<ref name="AI_dmg" />

Israel defends itself from such allegations on the grounds that Hezbollah's use of roads and bridges for military purposes made them legitimate targets.<ref name="AI_dmg" /> Amnesty International identifies Hezbollah as "a guerrilla group based among the civilian population," and notes the challenges faced when fighting them, including "identifying and destroying weapons located in civilian houses while minimizing harm to civilians."<ref name=AI_proportion>

Terms for a ceasefire had been drawn and revised several times over the course of the conflict, yet successful agreement between the two sides took several weeks.

Despite Lebanon's call for support for a ceasefire, the United States and the United Kingdom, hoping to have Hezbollah wiped out, hampered the ceasefire process. [[John Bolton]] confirmed that the US and UK, with support from several Arab leaders, delayed the ceasefire process. Outsider efforts to interfere with a ceasefire only ended when it became apparent Hezbollah would not be easily defeated.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bolton admits Lebanon truce block|Date=[[2007-03-22]]|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6479377.stm}}</ref>

On [[11 August]] [[2006]] the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved [[UN Security Council Resolution 1701]], in an effort to end the hostilities. It was accepted by the Lebanese government and Hezbollah on [[12 August]] [[2006]], and by the Israeli government on [[13 August]] [[2006]].

On [[21 August]], a group of demobilized Israel reserve soldiers and parents of soldiers killed in the fighting started [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest|a movement]] calling for the resignation of Ehud Olmert and the establishment of a state commission of [[Public inquiry|inquiry]]. They set up a protest tent opposite the Knesset and grew to over 2,000 supporters by [[25 August]],<ref name="Yoman">[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=31&ar=yoman "Yoman"], ''[[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]'', [[25 August]] [[2006]] {{he icon}}</ref> including the influential [[Movement for Quality Government in Israel|Movement for Quality Government]].<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3295083,00.html "Hundreds support protesting reservists"], ''[[Ynetnews]]'', [[24 August]] [[2006]]</ref><ref name="Yoman"/> On [[28 August]], Olmert [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest#Prospects for a state commission|announced]] that there would be no independent state or governmental commission of inquiry, but two internal inspection probes, one to investigate the political echelon and one to examine IDF, and likely a third commission to examine the Home Front, to be announced at a later date. These would have a more limited mandate and less authority than a single inquiry commission headed by a retired judge.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/755787.html "Olmert: An inquiry commission will not be formed, we do not have the luxury to submerge in investigating the past"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', [[28 August]] [[2006]] {{he icon}}</ref> The political and military committees were to be headed by former director of [[Mossad]] [[Nahum Admoni]] and former [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]] [[Amnon Lipkin-Shahak]], respectively.

On [[12 September]], former defense minister [[Moshe Arens]] spoke of "the defeat of Israel" in calling for a state committee of inquiry. He said that Israel had lost "to a very small group of people, 5000 Hezbollah fighters, which should have been no match at all for the IDF," and stated that the conflict could have "some very fateful consequences for the future."

On [[18 July]] [[2006]] Hezbollah Press Officer Hussein Nabulsi took CNN's [[Nic Robertson]] on an exclusive tour of southern Beirut. Robertson noted that despite his minder's anxiety about explosions in the area, it was clear that Hezbollah had sophisticated media relations and were in control of the situation. Hezbollah designated the places that they went to, and the journalists "certainly didn't have time to go into the houses or lift up the rubble to see what was underneath."

* On [[1 December]] [[2006]], U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted a report to the Security Council president maintaining "there were no serious incidents or confrontations" since the cease-fire in August 2006. He did, however, note that peacekeepers reported air violations by Israel "almost on a daily basis," which Israel maintained were a security measure related to continuing Syrian and Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, and evidence of the presence of unauthorized armed personnel, assets, and weapons in Lebanon. In one case, a UNIFIL demining team was challenged by two Hezbollah members in combat uniforms armed with [[AK-47|AK-47 rifles]]. UNIFIL notified the Lebanese army, who arrested three suspects the next day. There were also "13 instances where UNIFIL came across unauthorized arms or related material in its area of operation", including the discovery of 17 katyusha rockets and several improvised explosive devices in [[Rachaiya El-Foukhar]], and the discovery of a weapons cache containing seven missiles, three rocket launchers, and a substantial amount of ammunition in the area of [[Bourhoz]].<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/02/news/UN_GEN_UN_Lebanon_Peacekeepers.php Annan: Israel's actions compromise efforts to stabilize the Israeli-Lebanon border]</ref><ref name="ynet_annan_report">Ynet News ([[2 December]] [[2006]]).

* On [[1 February]] 2007, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told the Winongrad Commission, formed to inquire into the Israeli-Lebanese war, that the attack was planned four months in advance based upon an earlier target list drawn up by former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
