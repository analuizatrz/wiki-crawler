'''PECOTA''', an acronym for '''P'''layer '''E'''mpirical '''C'''omparison and '''O'''ptimization '''T'''est '''A'''lgorithm, is a [[sabermetric]] system for predicting [[Major League Baseball]] player performance.<ref>The acronym was actually based on the name of journeyman major league player [[Bill Pecota]],[http://www.baseball-reference.com/p/pecotbi01.shtml] who with a lifetime [[batting average]] of .249 is perhaps representative of the typical PECOTA entry.  Beginning in 2000, the [[Cleveland Indians]] developed a proprietary analytical database called [http://www.cleveland.com/gameplan/index.ssf?/gameplan/more/part2.html ''DiamondView''] to evaluate scouting information gathered by the team; this system later incorporated player performance indicators and financial indicators, for purposes of evaluating and projecting the performance of all major league players.  In 2007, the [[Houston Astros]] organization created their own system and named it ''PANKOVITS,'' an acronym in honor of former utility player Jim Pankovits that stands for '''P'''layer '''A'''nalysis with '''N'''eutral '''K'''nowledge of '''O'''ffensively '''V'''ital '''I'''nformation '''T'''racking '''S'''tatistics. Neither the player projections nor the underlying methodology of these forecasting systems have been made public.</ref> It was invented by [[Nate Silver]] in 2002-2003 and introduced to the public in the book ''Baseball Prospectus 2003''.<ref>Nate Silver, "Introducing PECOTA," in Gary Huckabay, Chris Kahrl, Dave Pease ''et al.'', Eds., ''Baseball Prospectus 2003'' (Dulles, VA: Brassey's  Publishers, 2003): 507-514.</ref>  It shares the name of former [[Kansas City Royals]] player [[Bill Pecota]]. 

One of several widely publicized [[statistical]] systems of forecasts of player performance, PECOTA player forecasts are marketed by [[Baseball Prospectus]] (BP) as a [[fantasy baseball]] product.  Since 2003, annual PECOTA forecasts have been published both in the ''Baseball Prospectus'' annual books and, in more detailed form, on the [http://www.baseballprospectus.com BaseballProspectus.com] subscription-based website.<ref>Illustrative PECOTA estimates and "cards" are available for inspection by nonsubscribers here: http://www.baseballprospectus.com/pecota/.</ref> PECOTA forecasts a player's performance in all of the major categories used in typical fantasy baseball games; it also forecasts production in advanced sabermetric categories developed by Baseball Prospectus (e.g., [[VORP]] and [[Equivalent average|EqA]]).  In addition, PECOTA forecasts several summary diagnostics such as breakout rates, improve rates, and attrition rates, as well as the market values of the players.  The logic and methodology underlying PECOTA have been described in several publications, but the detailed formulas are [[proprietary]] and have not been shared with the baseball research community.

==Methodology==

Silver has described the inspiration for his approach as follows:
<blockquote>The basic idea behind PECOTA is really a fusion of two different things – [[Bill James|James's]] work on similarity scores and Gary Huckabay's work on Vlad, [Baseball Prospectus's] previous projection system, which tried to assign players to a number of different career paths.<ref>Gary Huckabay, "6-4-3: Reasonable Person Standard," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=1581 BaseballProspectus.com, August 2, 2002].</ref> I think Gary used something like thirteen or fifteen separate career paths, and all that PECOTA is really doing is carrying that to the logical extreme, where there is essentially a separate career path for every player in major league history. The comparability scores are the mechanism by which it picks and chooses from among those career paths.<ref>Rich Lederer, "An Unfiltered Interview with Nate Silver," [http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2007/02/an_unfiltered_i.php ''Baseball Analysts'', February 12, 2007.]</ref></blockquote>

===Comparable players===
PECOTA relies on fitting a given player's past performance statistics to the performance of "comparable" Major League ballplayers by means of [[similarity score]]s. As is described in the Baseball Prospectus website's glossary:<ref>http://baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?mode=viewstat&stat=38</ref>

<blockquote>PECOTA compares each player against a database of roughly 20,000 major league batter seasons since World War II. In addition, it also draws upon a database of roughly 15,000 translated minor league seasons (1997-2006) for players that spent most of their previous season in the minor leagues. . . . PECOTA considers four broad categories of attributes in determining a hitter's comparability:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. Production metrics – such as batting average, isolated power, and unintentional walk rate for hitters, or strikeout rate and groundball rate for pitchers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Usage metrics, including career length and plate appearances or innings pitched.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Phenotypic attributes, including handedness, height, weight, career length (for major leaguers), and minor league level (for prospects).</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. Fielding Position (for hitters) or starting/relief role (for pitchers). . . .  In most cases, the database is large enough to provide a meaningfully large set of appropriate comparables. When it isn't, the program is designed to 'cheat' by expanding its tolerance for dissimilar players until a reasonable sample size is reached.</blockquote> 

Although drawing on the underlying concept of [[Bill James]]' similarity scores, PECOTA calculates these scores in a distinct way that leads to a very different set of "comparables" than James' method.<ref>  This difference is explained and illustrated in Nate Silver, "Introducing PECOTA," ''Baseball Prospectus 2003,'' cited above.</ref>  Furthermore, Silver describes the following distinct feature: <blockquote>The PECOTA similarity scores are based primarily on looking at a three-year window of a pitcher’s performance. Thus, we might look at what a pitcher did from ages 35-37, and compare that against the most similar age 35-37 performances, after adjusting for parks, league effects, and a whole host of other things.  This is different from the similarity scores you might see at [http://www.baseball-reference.com/ baseball-reference.com] or in other places, which attempt to evaluate the totality of a player’s career up to a given age."<ref>http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=136.  Also see Baseball Prospectus' glossary entry for [http://baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?mode=viewstat&stat=38 "Comparable Players"].</ref></blockquote>
Once a set of "comparables" is determined for each player, his future performance forecast is based on the historical performance of his "comparables." For example, a 26 year-old's forecast performance in the coming season will be based on how the most comparable Major League 26 year-olds performed in their subsequent season.

Separate sets of predictions are developed for hitters and pitchers.

===Peripheral statistics===
PECOTA also relies a lot on the use of peripheral statistics to forecast a given player's future performance. For example, drawing on the insights coming out of the use of [[DIPS|defense-independent pitching statistics]], PECOTA forecasts a pitcher's future performance in a given area by using information about his past performance in other areas.<ref>See [[Peripheral ERA|PERA]] for an example of the use of peripheral statistics to estimate a performance.</ref> As baseball analyst and journalist [[Alan Schwarz]] writes, "Silver . . . designed a sophisticated variance algorithm that has examined every big-league pitcher's statistics since 1946 to determine which numbers best forecast effectiveness, specifically [[earned run average]]. His findings are counterintuitive to most fans. 'When you try to predict future E.R.A.'s with past E.R.A.'s, you're making a mistake,' Silver said.  Silver found that the most predictive statistics, by a considerable margin, are a pitcher's strikeout rate and walk rate. Home runs allowed, lefty-righty breakdowns and other data tell less about a pitcher's future."<ref>[[Alan Schwarz]], "Numbers Suggest Mets Are Gambling on Zambrano," ''New York Times'', August 22, 2004.</ref>

===Probability distributions===
Instead of focusing on making [[Point estimation|point estimates]] of a player's future performance (such as batting average, home runs, and strike-outs), PECOTA relies on the historical performance of the given player's "comparables" to produce a [[probability distribution]] of the given player's predicted performance during the next five years.  [[Alan Schwarz]] has emphasized this feature of PECOTA:  "What separates Pecota from the gaggle of projection systems that outsiders have developed over many decades is how it recognizes, even flaunts, the uncertainty of predicting a player's skills. Rather than generate one line of expected statistics, Pecota presents seven – some optimistic, some pessimistic – each with its own confidence level. The system greatly resembles the forecasting of hurricane paths: players can go in many directions, so preparing for just one is foolish."<ref>[[Alan Schwarz]], "Predicting Futures in Baseball, and the Downside of Damon," ''New York Times'', November 13, 2005.</ref> Silver has written,<blockquote> This procedure requires us to become comfortable with probabilistic thinking.  While a majority of players of a certain type may progress a certain way – say, peak early – there will always be exceptions. Moreover, the comparable players may not always perform in accordance with their true level of ability.  They will sometimes appear to exceed it in any given season, and other times fall short, because of the sample size problems that we described earlier.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PECOTA accounts for these sorts of factors by creating not a single forecast point, as other systems do, but rather a range of possible outcomes that the player could expect to achieve at different levels of probability. Instead of telling you that it's going to rain, we tell you that there's an 80% chance of rain, because 80% of the time that these atmospheric conditions have emerged on Tuesday, it has rained on Wednesday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Surely, this approach is more complicated than the standard method of applying an age adjustment based on the 'average' course of development of all players throughout history. However, it is also leaps and bounds more representative of reality, and more accurate to boot.<ref>Nate Silver, "Baseball Prospectus Basics: The Science of Forecasting," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2659 BaseballProspectus.com, March 11,2004].</ref></blockquote>

===Team effort===
Although Silver is the creator and steward of PECOTA, he acknowledges that PECOTA forecasts are a team product:  "I might be `the PECOTA guy,' but it very much is a team effort," he says of the BP staff. "We all do it. It's my baby, but it takes a village to run a PECOTA."<ref>William Hageman, "Baseball By the Numbers," ''Chicago Tribune'', January 4, 2006.</ref>  For example, PECOTA draws on [[Clay Davenport]]'s translations (the so-called Davenport Translations or DT's) of minor league and international baseball statistics to estimate the major league equivalent performance of each player.<ref>See Clay Davenport, "DT's vs. MLEs — A Validation Study," [http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=49 BaseballProspectus.com, January 30, 1998]; Clay Davenport, "Winter and Fall League Translations: Just How Good Are These Leagues, Anyway?," [http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2528 BaseballProspectus.com, January 27, 2004]; and Clay Davenport, "Over There! A Second Review of Translating Japanese Statistics, and Translating the Mexican League," ''Baseball Prospectus 2004'' (New York: Workman, 2004): 585-590.</ref>  In this way, PECOTA is able to make projections for more than 1,600 players each year, including many players with little or no prior major league experience.

==Alternative forecasting systems==
Most of the other popular forecasting systems do not use a "comparable players" approach.  Instead most rely on direct projections from a player's past performance to his future performance, typically by using as a baseline a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] of a player's performance in his previous three years.  Like PECOTA, many of those systems also adjust the projections for aging, [[Batting Park Factor|park effects]] and [[regression toward the mean]].  Like PECOTA, they may also adjust for the competitive difficulty of each of the two major leagues.<ref>PECOTA's aging adjustment is implicit in the path of "future" performance of the set of historical "comparable" players.</ref> The systems differ from one another, however, in the types and intensities of age adjustments, regression-effect estimates, park adjustments, and league-difficulty adjustments that they may make as well as in whether they use similarity scores.<ref>Among the current major alternative statistically-based projection systems are [[Tom Tango]]'s Marcel projections (available and documented for 2007 at [http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/weve-got-the-2007-marcels/ The Hardball Times]); [[Diamond Mind Baseball]], also described in an [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/preview07/news/story?id=2820932 [[ESPN.com]] article] on 2007 team projections; Ron Shandler's [http://www.baseballhq.com/ Baseball HQ] and his annual book, ''Baseball Forecaster'';  [[The Hardball Times]] pre-season forecasts, inaugurated with the 2007 season; [http://lanaheimangelfan.blogspot.com/ Chone Smith's] "Chone Projections," reported on the website of [http://fangraphs.com Fangraphs.com]; [http://www.baseballinfosolutions.com/bjh_07_regular.html Baseball Info Solutions – BIS]; and Dan Szymborski's [http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/oracle/discussion/2007_zips_projection_disk_build_2/ "ZiPS"] Projections.</ref>  PECOTA also makes projections for many more players than do other systems, because PECOTA relies on adjusted minor league statistics as well as major league statistics and tries to make projections for all of the players on major league [[Major League Baseball transactions#25-man and 40-man roster|expanded rosters]] (40 players per team) as well as other [[Prospect (sports)|prospects]].

==Updates and revisions==
First introduced in 2003,<ref>Nate Silver, "Introducing PECOTA," ''Baseball Prospectus 2003'', cited previously.</ref> PECOTA projections are produced each year and published both in the ''Baseball Prospectus'' annual monographs and on the [http://www.baseballprospectus.com BaseballProspectus.com] website.  PECOTA has undergone several improvements since 2003.  The 2006 version introduced metrics for the market [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] of players based on the predicted performance levels.  The 2007 version introduced adjustments for league effects, to account for differences in the competitive environment of the two major leagues.<ref>"Baseball Prospectus Chat: Nate Silver," [http://baseballprospectus.com/chat/chat.php?chatId=253 BaseballProspectus.com, January 19, 2007].</ref> The 2008 update is said to try to take into account differences in players' performance during the first and second halves of the previous season<ref>"Chat: Nate Silver," [http://baseballprospectus.com/chat/chat.php?chatId=376 Baseball Prospectus.com, October 17, 2007].</ref> as well as platoon splits (how well a player performed against hitters or pitchers who were left- or right-handed).<ref>Nate Silver, "A Quick Note on Platoon Splits," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=669 BaseballProspectus.com, November 9, 2007].</ref> It is also said to take into account baserunning.<ref>Nate Silver, "Is Baserunning a Skill?" [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=683 BaseballProspectus.com, November 29, 2007].</ref>

==Accuracy==
Although Baseball Prospectus promotes PECOTA commercially as "deadly accurate," all projection systems are subject to considerable uncertainty.  Nonetheless, the test of PECOTA is its ability to make accurate [[Forecasting|forecasts]] in comparison with alternative forecasting methods.  A comparison for the 2006 season shows that PECOTA outperformed several other forecasting systems in predicting hitting ([[On-base plus slugging|OPS]]) and performed nearly as well as the best of the other systems in predicting pitching ([[Earned run average|ERA]]).<ref>Dan Szymborski, "2006 Projections," [http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/newsstand/discussion/2006_projection_results/ BaseballThinkFactory.com, December 14, 2006].</ref>

Although designed primarily for predicting ''individual'' player performance, PECOTA has been applied also to predicting ''team'' performance.  For this purpose, projected team [[depth chart]]s are established with projected playing times for each team member, drawing on the expert advice of the Baseball Prospectus staff. The number of runs a team will score and allow during the coming season is estimated based on the playing times and PECOTA's predicted individual performance of each player, using a "Marginal Lineup Value" algorithm created by David Tate and further developed by [[Keith Woolner]].<ref>[[Keith Woolner]], "Marginal Lineup Value," [http://www.stathead.com/bbeng/woolner/mlvdesc.htm StatHead.com].</ref>  A team's expected wins is based on applying an improved version of Bill James' [[Pythagorean expectation|Pythagorean Formula]] to the estimated number of runs scored and allowed by the roster of players under the given playing-time assumptions.<ref>On the Pythagenport formula, see [[Clay Davenport]] and [[Keith Woolner]], "Revisiting the Pythagorean Theorem: Putting Bill James' Pythagorean Theorem To the Test," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=342 BaseballProspectus.com, June 30, 1999] as well as the Baseball Prospectus glossary entry for "Pythagenport"[http://baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?mode=viewstat&stat=136].  On the construction of the depth charts for each team and the application of PECOTA to estimating team wins, see Nate Silver, "PECOTA Projects the American League," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=3836 BaseballProspectus.com, March 21, 2005]; and Nate Silver, "PECOTA Breaks Hearts," [http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=4917 BaseballProspectus.com, March 29, 2006].</ref> 

PECOTA has been used in preseason forecasts of how many wins teams will attain and in mid-season simulations of the number of wins each team will attain and its odds of reaching the playoffs.<ref>See Clay Davenport, "Playoff Odds Report: The Addition of PECOTA," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5036 BaseballProspectus.com, May 3, 2006] and [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/statistics/ps_oddspec.php Baseball Prospectus Statistics].</ref> In 2006, PECOTA's preseason forecasts compared favorably to other forecasting systems (including [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] betting line odds) in predicting the number of wins teams would earn during the season.<ref>Nate Silver, "Projection Reflection," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5609 ''BaseballProspectus.com'', October 11, 2006].</ref>
