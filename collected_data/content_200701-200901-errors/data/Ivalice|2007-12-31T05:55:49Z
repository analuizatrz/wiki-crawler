{{Final Fantasy locations}}
{{nihongo|'''Ivalice'''|イヴァリース|Ivarīsu}} is a fictional location in the ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' and ''[[Vagrant Story]]'' universes. The world was conceived by [[Yasumi Matsuno]] when he joined [[Square Co., Ltd.]] (now [[Square Enix|Square Enix Co., Ltd.]]) in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], and has since been expanded upon by several games, with more yet due with the ''Ivalice Alliance'' series. Ivalice is described as a complex world with a very long history, and the stories of ''Vagrant Story'', ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', and ''Final Fantasy XII'' are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map.<ref name="matsunoqa">{{cite web | url=http://www.ffworld.com/?rub=ff12&page=interview_jp-mai04 | title=Interview - Yasumi Matsuno | year=2004 | author=FFWorld Staff | work=www.ffworld.com}}</ref> 

Though described often as a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'', in which Ivalice was created parallel to the 'real' world. The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region,<ref name="ivalice"> Ivalice (Sage Knowledge 29 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> and a smaller [[kingdom]], both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice is also used to refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say "the world of [[medieval Europe]]."

==Concept and creation==
Ivalice has been featured in several ''Final Fantasy'' games, as well as in ''[[Vagrant Story]]'' to a lesser extent. This fictional world was created by [[Yasumi Matsuno]] with its own identity; a medieval-like world where magic and machine exist together; with usual elements of ''Final Fantasy''; such as Chocobos, Crystals and magic spells, blended into its setting.

''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' features the kingdom of Ivalice, neighboring the kingdom of Romanda in the northwest, separated by Larner Channel sea, and the kingdom of Ordalia at the east. Only Humans populate the area, and even though magic is prominent, airships have ceased to exist following a mysterious catastrophe. The worldview is similar to medieval England, with the Glabados Church a prominent religious entity.

In ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'', the protagonist lives in a town named St. Ivalice, an area mirroring the modern world located at a four-seasoned region. Following the characters' discovery of the book called the Gran Grimoire, St. Ivalice was transformed into the kingdom of Ivalice, mirroring a ''Final Fantasy'' game.<ref>'''Mewt''': I love Final Fantasy, that's my favorite.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics Advance |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=GameBoy Advance |language=English}}</ref> The game is confirmed to be ''Final Fantasy XII'' due to existence of the races that inhabit the game; Bangaa, Moogle, Viera and Nu Mou.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Omega | pages=146 | publisher=Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-7575-1821-8}}</ref> 

In ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', Ivalice covers three continents, Ordalia, Valendia and Kerwon. The demography consists of the known races: Humes, Bangaa, Viera, Seeq and Moogles, and other  minority races. Civilization is advanced in this world where the use of magical stone called magicite is extensive in everyday life, airships are a prominent transportation and multi-story buildings cover the cityscape.

Executive producer [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] explained that the aim of the ''Ivalice Alliance'' is to "spread the word about the world of Ivalice", and to bring more players into the franchise, with new titles not restricted to the standard role-playing game genre but also [[tactical role-playing game|tactical games]] and games similar to ''Vagrant Story''.<ref name="FFTA2 Interview">{{cite web | url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/789/789038p1.html | title=Interview: Final Fantasy Tactics A2 | accessdate=2007-07-13 | author=Craig Harris |date=2007-05-16 | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref> ''Revenant Wings'' director [[Motomu Toriyama]] noted that with the large and original team that worked on ''Final Fantasy XII'', Ivalice became more Square Enix's world than that of the former Quest team, and that the ''Ivalice Alliance'' world is thus slightly more influenced by ''Final Fantasy XII'' than the earlier Ivalice titles.<ref name="1UP Interview">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3159538 | title=Interviews on Final Fantasy's Nintendo DS, Wii Assault| accessdate=2007-07-13 | author=James Mielke |date=2007-05-15 | work=[[1UP.com]] | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref>

===Timeline===
[[Image:Ivalice-time.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The timeline of ''Final Fantasy XII'' as compared to ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.]]
The timeline of Ivalice as presented in the games was left quite vague, and formerly other official sources had said little on the matter. A few venerable sources have made their own conclusion on the timeline of Ivalice.<ref name=GameSpot>{{cite web | author=Matthew Rorie|date=2006-09-23| title=TGS 06: ''Final Fantasy XII'' Q&A| work=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/news.html?sid=6158485 | accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=7630629&publicUserId=5624991| title=''Final Fantasy XII'' Review | year=2006-11-17| author=Roger, Christian | accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The official timeline, however, was eventually given in the ''Final Fantasy XII'' [[Ultimania]] Omega, and placed the events of ''Final Fantasy XII'' before those of ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.

There is no direct mention of Ivalice in ''[[Vagrant Story]]''. However, several references are made; the Kingdom of Valendia, the setting for ''Vagrant Story'', shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in ''Final Fantasy XII''. The Kiltia religion, featured in ''Final Fantasy XII'', was the religion of the [[ghost town]] Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Alazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the Lion War (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in ''Final Fantasy Tactics''), is used at the beginning of the game,<ref>{{cite web | author=Barhaven | accessdate=2007-07-21 | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061006025039/barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/VSScript/vsscript01.html | title=''Vagrant Story'' script - Duke Bardorba’s Manor}}</ref> and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story.<ref>{{cite web | author=Barhaven | accessdate=2007-07-21 | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061006025039/barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/vsodd.html | title=''FFT References'' section}}</ref> This would seem to place ''Vagrant Story'' latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.

Some confusion still persists, particularly due to the facts surrounding Saint Ajora, who was executed 1200 years prior to the events of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'',<ref name="ajora">Born around twelve centuries ago in Bervenia of Lesalia.  Raised in Milodos.  Spoke of the arrival of a kingdom of a higher source, as feelings of anitpathy grew from Father Fara.  Executed as a traitor by the Holy Empire of Yudora.  Soon after, the capital of the Church of Fara became submerged under the sea by an extraordinary natural phenomenon.  Those disciples of Ajora believed this was his miracle.  As these stories spread, the Glabados Church became what it is today. {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy Tactics]] |developer=[[Square]] |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> yet in the Clan Primer of ''Final Fantasy XII'' is said to have separated from the Light of Kiltia religion shortly after its foundation, already two thousand years old.<ref name="magickpot"> The Light of Kilita (Sage Knowledge 7 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary <br>"The Light of Kiltia - Religion begun by the prophet Kiltia over two millennia ago.

After embarking on a pilgrimage to proselytize and deliver the word of the vision he had seen to the people, Kiltia came to Mt Bur-Omisace, and from there his teachings spread. The Light of Kiltia, as his teachings were called, continued even after his death, until they covered all Ivalice. Though the followers and churches of Kiltia are spread far and wide, they do not interfere in affairs of state or governance. Though at one point the church held considerable influence, they willingly discarded that power, fearing oppression. Ever since, the church officials with the rank of celebrant or higher have been forbidden from participating in statecraft. In addition, Mt. Bur-Omisace maintains a mutual non-incursion policy with the surrounding territories. Several years after Kiltia's founding, Saint Ajora began a new teaching, claiming that Faram alone was the one true god, the popularity of this new sect further lessening the power of the Light."<br> {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-10 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> While no gender is specified in the North American release of ''Final Fantasy XII'', in both the Japanese Clan Primer and the Ultimania timeline, Ajora is referred to as 聖女アジョラ, ''Holy Woman Ajora'', while Ajora of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' is male.<ref name="ajora" /><ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Omega | pages=146 | publisher=Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-7575-1821-8}}</ref> 

The appearance of some special characters in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' may have further added to the confusion of the era the game takes place in. However, these characters were added into the game to give a sense of surprise and enjoyment to the player but so as to not disturb other future or past events in the history of Ivalice. [[Cloud Strife]], [[Balthier]], and [[Luso]] make cameo appearances that have a small or otherwise insignificant impact in ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', and these characters originate from, respectively, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift]]''. They either have originated from the past or the future of Ivalice's history, depending on the select character.

==Geography==
===''Final Fantasy Tactics''===
[[Image:FFTIvalice.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.]]
The events of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' are set in the kingdom of Ivalice, which borders Ordalia in the east and the insular nation of Romanda in the north-west, from which it is separated by the Larner Channel. The kingdom forms a [[peninsula]] and is composed of seven provinces which were individual kingdoms before their unification: Gallione, Lionel, Lesalia, Fovoham, Limberry, Zeltennia and Murond.<ref>{{cite video game | title=[[Final Fantasy Tactics]] | developer=[[Square Co.|Square]] | publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=1998-01-28 | platform=[[PlayStation]] | level=Germonik Scriptures | quote=Long before Ivalice was united, it was divided into 7 small kingdoms.

The insular province of Murond is home to the Glabados Church and is ruled separately from the royal government.<ref>{{cite video game | title=[[Final Fantasy Tactics]] | developer=[[Square Co.|Square]] | publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=1998-01-28 | platform=[[PlayStation]] | level=World map | quote='''Murond Holy Place''' - Murond base, strongest of the Glabados churches.

=== ''Vagrant Story'' ===
[[Image:LeaMonde.jpg|thumb|right|Leá Monde]]
''Vagrant Story'' is set in the ruins of the city of Leá Monde. The kingdom of Valendia is also heavily mentioned, and a few of its locations are featured in the prologue and the ending sequence. In contrast to the other Ivalice games, magic is rare, being suppressed by religious doctrine.<ref>{{cite video game | title=[[Vagrant Story]] | developer=[[Square Co.|Square]] | publisher=Square |date=2000-05-15 | platform=[[PlayStation]] | level=Wine Cellar, Wine Guild Hall | quote='''Goodwin''': And procure the miracles of Leà Monde!

===''Final Fantasy XII''===
[[Image:Ivalice (FF12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The explorable section of Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy XII''. This map focuses solely on a small area centered on the Galtean Peninsula. Ivalice proper extends beyond its confines.<ref name="memoirs" />]]
The continents in Ivalice are presently home to three nations: Rozarria, Archadia and Dalmasca. There was once the Kingdom of Nabradia and the Republic of Landis in Valendia, now either destroyed or assimilated into the Archadian Empire. Strategically located between the rival neighboring empires of Archadia and Rozarria, Dalmasca's position as a neutral buffer region between the two countries is eliminated when it is invaded by Archadia. With the fall of Landis and Nabradia and its reduction to an occupied territory under Archadian rule, Dalmasca is set to play a central role in the still-heated dispute between its neighbors, which is escalating once more.

The events of ''Final Fantasy XII'' are focused on the area around the Galtean [[Peninsula]], itself located in the larger Ivalice region.<ref name="ivalice" /><ref name="memoirs">Memoirs of Marquis Halim Ondore IV {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> This area of Ivalice is diverse in both geography and climate,<ref name="ivalice" /> ranging from the hilly, clement [[grassland]]s of southern Valendia<ref name="valendia"> Valendia (Sage Knowledge 31 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> to the [[desert]]s of Dalmasca.<ref name="desert"> Ordalia (Sage Knowledge 30 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> In Kerwon, south of Dalmasca, the lands are arid at lower altitudes, though the higher elevations are the only places in the region known to receive snow.<ref name="kerwon"> Kerwon (Sage Knowledge 32 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> The north of Kerwon is heavily forested, home to the dense Golmore Jungle, within which lies the magical Feywood.<ref name="feywood"> The Feywood (Sage Knowledge 73 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref><ref name="golmore"> Golmore Jungle (Sage Knowledge 72 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

These various micro-climates are influenced by the magical phenomenon known as Mist, an unstable substance with the ability to cause great variation over small areas.<ref name="mist"> Mist (Sage Knowledge 09 of 78) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Due to the influence of Mist, several areas of Ivalice are 'jagd', areas in which Mist-laden winds and [[magicite]]-rich soil interfere with airship mechanisms. As such, jagds tend to be harsh, lawless frontiers, uncontrolled by any nation.<ref name="jagd"> Jagd (Sage Knowledge 38 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Physically, the peninsula area resembles [[Europe]] in the east, with the landmasses of Valendia, Ordalia and Kerwon surrounding a central body of water (the Naldoan Sea) on three sides. To the west, Valendia and Kerwon curve away from Ordalia, creating the Galtean Peninsula.

Mist is responsible for the existence of 'magicite', stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that are installed into a component known as 'glossair rings' that give flight to the vehicles, whether small-sized bikes or large airships, and memstones that function much like [[recording]] devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its cost-efficiency, led to it replacing [[electricity]] and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice.

Nethicite, another type of magicite, works by absorbing Mist, thus nullifying the effects of magic and storing vast amounts of power. Nethicite can be described as either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or [[man-made]]). Deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, the ultimate source of which is the Sun-Cryst. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice.

===''Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings'' ===
[[Image:RWLemures.JPG|thumb|right|The ''Purvama'' Lemurés]]
A few locations in the Ivalice of ''Final Fantasy XII'' return in ''Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings'', along with a new setting: Lemurés. A legendary ''Purvama'' (Floating Continent) raised into the skies by the god Feolthanos long ago, this land is ruled by three “Sacred Crystals” called Auraliths, which erected a barrier to shield the Purvama from the rest of the world. In time, the “Legend of the Floating Land” became an ambition for Sky Pirates who seek the island for Auracite, pieces of Auralith able to allow one to summon entities called Yahri. The ruins of Lemurés are where the [[Ivalice#Demography|Aegyl]] reside.
But as Vaan and gang soon learned, the sealing of Lemurés was the work of the Occuria, whom Feolthanos defied prior to using the Auralith to become a god-like being.

==Demography==
The populations seen in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' and ''[[Vagrant Story]]'' are essentially human. The other intelligent races who appear are hostile or monster-like, such as [[Monsters of Final Fantasy#Other monsters|Goblins]] or [[Ogre]]s. Friendly intelligent races appear in later games set in Ivalice, where the human race is called Humes.

It's also worth noting that monsters and the like are thought not to exist by the general populace in ''Vagrant Story'', with the monsters in the isolated Leá Monde all stemming from the Dark. The races are sorted by appearance and then according to the alphabetical order.

===''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance''===
Ivalice as featured in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' is populated by four main intelligent races in addition to Humes; all of them also reappearing in ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''.

The {{nihongo|Bangaa|バンガ|Banga}} are a [[reptilian]] race living almost twice as long as Humes. Being a very socially and cognitively advanced race, they hate being called "[[lizards]]" as this is regarded as an offensive slur. Bangaa in ''Final Fantasy XII'' are often considered to be the most integrated of all races into Hume society, and are the race most friendly with the latter, as exemplified with [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Migelo|Migelo]]. Bangaa possess great agility and strength, and acute senses of hearing and smell, making them excellent hunters and fighters. However, their eyesight is so poor that some wear blindfolds as part of their clothing. Their magical abilities are generally poor due to problems their unique mouth gives them when chanting magic spells. To make up for this, some Bangaa have developed exclusive high level spells for the race to use.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy XII Scenario Ultimania | pages=90 | publisher=Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-7575-1696-7}}</ref>

The {{nihongo|[[Moogles]]|モーグリ|Mōguri}} are a resourceful race known to be skillful in mechanics and engineering; they were the first pioneers of airship construction. They have longer, rabbit-like ears and tend to have more beige or gray fur.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy XII Scenario Ultimania | pages=89 | publisher=Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-7575-1696-7}}</ref> In ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', the player is guided through the world of Ivalice by the moogles Montblanc and Nono. In ''Final Fantasy XII'', these two characters return albeit with different roles. Although Moogles were featured in ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' only as summoned creatures, their race is mentioned in the backtstory as having once lived in the Sweegy Woods.

[[Image:FF12NuMou.jpg|100px|left|thumb|A Nu Mou from ''Final Fantasy XII'']]
The {{nihongo|Nu Mou|ン・モゥ|N Mou}}　are a dog-like race. They are short and hunched; half the size of an adult Hume, are adept in magic and can speak with monsters. The Nu Mou's lifespan is three times longer than that of a Hume. Two Nu Mou, [[Characters of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance#Babus Swain|Babus Swain]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance#Ezel Berbier|Ezel Berbier]], appear as optional playable characters in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance''. All of the races have an infinite number of possible playable characters, but these two are the only Nu Mou with special sprites. In ''Final Fantasy XII'', most of the Nu Mou appear as acolytes of the Kiltia religion, found mainly in Mt. Bur-Omisace.<ref name="ulp92">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy XII Scenario Ultimania | pages=92 | publisher=Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-7575-1696-7}}</ref>

[[Image:Viera archer.jpg|100px|right|thumb|A Viera from ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'']]
The {{nihongo|Viera|ヴィエラ|Viera}} are a rabbit-like race that can live three times as long as a Hume, and divided into two subraces: The light-skinned Veena and dark-skinned Rava. The Viera have rabbit or deer-like features, most notably their long ears. Their feet are shaped in such a way that in order to stand they must wear high heels. Their slender forms heighten their senses and speed, and although their defense is low, Viera agility and finesse are unmatched by other race. In ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', Vieras have blue-white or purple-white hair, with only a few having hair that is pure white, which is considered to be a blessing. Viera can listen to the surrounding nature and sense Mist, and can sometimes go berserk from feeling an overwhelmingly vast quantity of active Mist. In ''Final Fantasy XII'', they live in hidden villages deep within the vast forests of Ivalice. The Viera believe themselves to be intimately tied to the "Wood", a part of the forests themselves, and are rarely involved in matters outside the wood. A Viera that moves out of the forest, like [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Fran|Fran]], is considered an outcast and dead to her people. Mixed breeds of Veena and Rava Viera have accustomed themselves to coexist within Hume society, dyeing their white hair. Regarding the lack of males seen, it is found that males and females live separately, only meeting when there is a need for it.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy XII Scenario Ultimania | pages=88 | publisher=Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-7575-1696-7}}</ref>

===''Final Fantasy XII''===
''Final Fantasy XII'' introduces several other races to Ivalice, with varying importance in the plot of the game.

The {{nihongo|Baknamy|バクナムス|Bakunamusu}} are a green-skinned humanoid race. Their bodies are relatively small in stature; even as an adult, their height is only the size of a child [[Races of Final Fantasy#Hume|Hume]]. After the kingdom of Nabradia ceased to exist, they designated the Necrohol of Nabudis as their stronghold. The Baknamy are sensitive to the air that they breathe, and living where the air is polluted due to the city's destruction forces them to wear gas masks. The poorer and less fortunate Baknamy commit crimes to earn a living, targeting adventurers and travelers, causing Humes to view them as a despicable race.<ref name="ulp93">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy XII Scenario Ultimania | pages=93 | publisher=Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-7575-1696-7}}</ref>

The {{nihongo|Garif|ガリフ|Garifu}}　of ''Final Fantasy XII'' are depicted as large, thick-furred appreciators of nature and the arts of war, but disliking unnecessary violence. They have high smelling and hearing senses, which make them able hunters. The Garif prefer to adorn themselves with natural ornaments of animal bones and stones over crafted objects, with the exception of a traditional mask which is worn from birth to death. Their villages are sparsely located in the Bancour Region, and each is governed by a council led by a [[patriarchy|High Elder]]. Relations with other races are peaceful but rare. Garif merchants are known to trade with the nomads of Giza Plains and the Dalmascans, exchanging items such as Bancour spices. In ancient times, the Occuria granted the Garif nethicite, however the Garif's dislike for violence hindered them from using its power.<ref name="ulp92" />

The {{nihongo|Helgas|ヘルガス|Herugasu}} are a long-living, highly intelligent race. Helgas are white-haired, tall, thin, and have long limbs. They can communicate telepathically while asleep, and also probe into the dreams of others.

The {{nihongo|Urutan-Yensa|ウルタン＝エンサ|Urutan-Ensa}} are the "Lords and Masters of the Great Sea", a name bestowed befitting their presence in the Yensa Sandsea and mastery in taming the Yensa fish for travel. Evolved from crustaceans, their bodies are thin and entirely covered by layers of clothing, which the game's Bestiary states is either to hide their ugly bodies or to keep themselves protected from the sun. The Urutan-Yensa divided into separate tribes ruled by a queen able to speak the Hume language, and are strictly territorial, attacking anyone who enters their lands. Urutan-Yensa are particularly proud and attached to honor so much that requesting the aid of others outside their race results in a death penalty. They sometimes exile tribe members that show unusual aggressive and violent nature, known as the Urutan-Exile.<ref name="ulp93" />

===''Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings''===
The {{nihongo|Aegyl|エグル|Eguru}} is a winged, humanlike race appearing in ''[[Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings]]''. These wings count as both a blessing (able to fly in the air) and a curse (resulting in a lifespan of 40 years). The Aegyl dwell in the ruins of the Lemurés. They are a people without emotion and thus have no true conflict amongst themselves, but there are a few who tend to go against the will of their people; such as [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Llyud|Llyud]]. But overtime, as Auraliths were being destroyed, the Aegyl regained their emotions and some only rage on the Sky Pirates who terrorized them. Their race departed from Ivalice when Lemurés crumbled.

The {{nihongo|Feol Viera|フォル・ヴィエラ|Foru Viera}} is a sub-race of the Viera, characterized by light blond hair and shorter ears than standard Viera. They are the descendants of the Aegyl chief Feolthanos who fell in love with a full-blood Viera. The Feol were from birth treated as exhiles by their full blood kin, cast out of the Wood to take refuge at Roda Volcano, where none dare enter. Since they have no wings, Feolthanos left the airship Galbana and the Auracite in the hopes that one day they come to him. He inheritence was recieved by Mydia/Judge of Wings, whom he later used to decimate all that remained of his progeny.

===''Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift''===

==Religion==
Prior to the events of ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', the Fara church dominated the kingdom of Ivalice.<ref name="fara">Germonik Scriptures {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=1998-01-28 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> The life of Ajora saw Fara replaced with the new Glabados church which, by the time of the game, is the one major religion of the kingdom. Glabados is [[monotheistic]] and intensely political, underscoring much of Ivalice history. Followers of Glabados use the word Farlem ("Faram" in the original Japanese version of the game) to affirm their prayers.<ref name="Farlem">'''Priest''': With the Father's blessing, you shall return to Earth.

In ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', the Iocus priesthood of the kingdom of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, although they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde.<ref name="vagrantultimania">{{Cite book | year=2000 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Vagrant Story Ultimania | pages=? | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Co. | id=ISBN ISBN4-925075-75-6}}</ref><ref name="rood">{{cite web | author=Barhaven | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061006025039/barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/vsodd.html| title=''Roods'' section | accessyear=2007-07-21}}</ref> Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia,<ref name="vagrantultimania" /> and bore the rood on her back.<ref name= "rood" /> The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic,<ref name="blackarts">'''Sackheim''': Rubbish!

In ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', the Light of Kiltia, a [[polytheistic]] religion, is the dominant church in Ivalice, having influence in the political affairs of the region around the Galtean Peninsula.<ref name="kiltiapolitics">'''Larsa:''' With the blessing of His Grace the Gran Kiltias Anastasis, you may rightly wear your crown, and declare the restoration of the Kingdom of Dalmasca. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Despite this, the church maintains an apolitical stance, with its most high-ranking officials banned from participating in political affairs altogether.<ref name="kiltia"> The Light of Kiltia (Sage Knowledge 7 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> At its head is the Gran Kiltias, being the Helgas Anastasis at the time of ''Final Fantasy XII'', until his death during the events of the story.

In ''[[Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings]]'', Feolthanos established a [[personality cult]] over Lemurés, labeling himself to his people as a god. Though Lemurés still had a sense of peace and paradise, in spite of Yahri attacks, it was a false paradise due to the Aurcite draining the Aegyl of their anima as part of Feolthanos' plan to destory Ivalice as revenge against the Occurians.

==Mythology==
<!--
A section in which to address magic, nethicite, the Occuria &C., in the manner of the Spira article. Should mention the Dark from Vagrant Story too.
-->
Within ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', legends revolve around the [[Zodiac]] Brave Story, which deals with twelve knights who used the power of Zodiac Stones - magical stones engraved with symbols of the twelve Zodiac constellations - to fight against a demon summoned by an ambitious king to control Ivalice. This myth was twisted by the Glabados Church, as explained in the game's backstory, by including St. Ajora as the leader of the Zodiac Braves.

The Lucavi, conceptually based in part on a wish granting devil from feudal era mythology named Lucavi,{{Fact|date=December 2007}} are demons linked to the twelve Zodiac Stones who seek to gain control of Ivalice by resurrecting their defeated leader, the Bloody Angel Altima. Any person who holds a Zodiac Stone may make a contract with the Lucavian demon associated with it, and in doing so, become one with that demon. During the events of the game, the Lucavi manipulate the Glabados Church into controlling the War of the Lions to ensure enough bloodshed for Altima's resurrection. A thirteenth Lucavi, associated with the sun constellation [[Ophiuchus]], can also be found in a side-quest. Some of the Lucavi reappear as [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning magic|Totema]] in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'', while a sub-boss, Gukko, becomes a "Rukavi" before his final encounter with the party, with an appearance similar to that of a vampire-type enemy.

''Vagrant Story''' centers around the '''Dark''', a formless, invisible entity. In places where the Dark runs strongest, those who died will have their corpses controlled by the dark, becoming the [[zombie|undead]].<ref>'''Guildenstern''': The Dark is formless and invisible. It invades the body like a plague, an unseen visitor. Yet those it taints become...undying. {{cite video game|title=Vagrant Story |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2000-05-15 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>. The Dark exists within a person as negative energy that unleashes the individual's latent power.<ref>'''Hardin''': We all possess energy, Inquisitor. But it is a negative energy. An energy that should not exist. Yet it does, and it awakens the sleeping power... / '''Merlose''': The "Dark"? {{cite video game|title=Vagrant Story |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2000-05-15 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Throughout the story, many individuals crave the powers of the Dark, which centers around the abandoned city of Leá Monde. Another mythological aspect of ''Vagrant Story'' is the Kiltia, an ancient cult which builts itself upon the Dark and ancient sorcery, and of which the Müllenkamp sect is stemmed from. It can be seen that most rituals and summoning performed in the game involved ancient Kildean magic.<ref name="ankildea" />

''Final Fantasy XII'' also introduces the '''Occuria''', immortal beings who have no visible faces, only a pair of glowing yellow eyes seen under their floating shell-like armor, surrounded by an aquamarine aura. The Occuria can become selectively invisible, and are also capable of possession, shape-shifting and image projection. Referred to by some as gods, but unknown to the main religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a central role in the history of Ivalice, controlling all major events, such as the rise of the Dynast-King Raithwall. Though peace fostered in Ivalice in the four-hundred year rule after Raithwall, the Occurian Venat, apparently disgusted with its kind's manupilations, rebelled and gave the secret of Nethicite to the Archadia's Dr. Cid and Vayne to overthrow the Occuria and make mankind the masters of their own fate. The events of the game eventually provoke the end the "Age of Stones"; the Occuria's control over Ivalice. In ''Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings'', Occuria were revealed to had played a part in the sealing of the Purvama Lemurés long ago, which by present time became a land of legend that many Sky Pirates sought for its Auracite.

''Revenant Wings'' also introduced beings known as the '''Yarhi'''. Also known as '''Espers''' to those on Ivalice, they are powerful entities created from anima, spiritual energy. Through certain elements, such as Auracite or Mist, the Yarhi can assume physical form until they are defeated in battle. They are summoned by the wielders of Auracite and obeys their every command. Fourteen such Yarhi appeared in ''Final Fantasy XII''; the first thirteen being the Lucavi from ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' reappear as Espers referred as the "Scions of darkness", magical beings created by Occuria with great strength and intelligence. Led by Ultima, they eventually rebelled for various reasons and engaged themselves in a war dubbed the Thousand Year War against the gods; but they were eventually defeated. Consequently, the gods bound their existence with the Glyph of the Beast, trapping them within the Mist. Any who controls the Glyph in turn controls the Scion, allowing them to operate as summoned creatures. The Fourteenth is the legendary swordman Gilgamesh, who collects the swords of those he defeats in battle. While most fight, few like Cu Sith and the Sahaguin Namingway offer aid in other ways.

==Reception and criticism==
{{Expand|date=December 2007}}
<!--
reception and criticism section; how has Ivalice been received by reviewers? do they enjoy the vast landscapes of XII, and the diverse regions of Tactics?)
-->
The Ivalice of ''Final Fantasy XII'' is regarded as the Japanese version of the [[Star Wars]] galaxy by a Gamespot reviewer. Even with the established fantasy setting, the airships and air battles gives the world a science-fiction feel. Adding to the "galaxy far, far away" mood is the mingling of different races within large cities and the political unrest between the rebellion and the Empire. Because the characters majorly traverse on foot, the world of ''Final Fantasy XII'' feels vast, and reviewers enjoyed sightseeing because of the impressive visuals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/review.html?mode=gsreview| title=Final Fantasy XII Review| author=Kasavin, Greg| year=2006-10-31 | accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>
