==Song==

'''''The Ordertaker''''' is a single by [[Philippines|Filipino]] Novelty Rock band Parokya ni Edgar.  It features Kamikazee.  It is a spoof of "[[Chop Suey!]]" and "[[Toxicity (song)|Toxicity]]" by System of a Down.  The melody is almost identical to that of Chop Suey!.  The song tells of a man who cannot order at a restaurant because he has no menu, and proceeds to list all of the different foods he would like to eat.  

==Video==

The video showed the two bands spoofing several wrestlers.  This is the music video sequel to Picha Pie in which Chito Miranda wears the same outfit from the last music video while Vinci Montaner is missing in action (he's in the wanted print ad).
