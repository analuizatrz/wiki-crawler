'''Mustafa Denizli''' (born [[November 10]], [[1949]] in [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]]) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] former [[football (soccer)|football]] player and an international [[coach (sports)|coach]].

==Playing career==
He spent 17 years with his hometown club [[Altay SK]] in İzmir, gaining a reputation as one of the best left-sided forwards in the [[Turkish Premier Super League|league]]. In [[1980]], he became topscorer with 12 goals. Denizli transferred then in [[1983]] to [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]], but retired at the end of the season [[1983]]-[[1984]] from active sport. During his playing time, he was capped 10 times for the [[Turkish national football team|national team]].

==Managerial career==
He started his next career as the assistant coach to [[Germany|German]] [[Jupp Derwall]] and served three years in this position at Galatasaray. In [[1987]], he took over his master’s position as coach. For the same season, Denizli was appointed head coach of the Turkish national football team. In the season [[1988]]-[[1989]], he reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League]] with Galatasaray, but the road to the final was blocked by [[Steaua Bucuresti]].

For the season [[1989]]-[[1990]], Denizli signed a contract with the German second league side [[Alemannia Aachen]]. Denizli had installed a new type of attacking football for the German club but he left from this club due to [[Alemannia Aachen]] was faced with relegation to third league. Returned back to Turkey after one season, he was responsible for Galatasaray again. The team won [[Turkish Football Cup|Turkish Cup]] under his management in [[1991]]-[[1992]] and played in the quarter finals of the [[Cup Winners Cup]]. From [[1992]] to [[1995]], he coached Kocaelispor and then he was appointed the second time head coach for the national team, he served until [[2000]]. At the [[2000 European Football Championship]], Turkey played quarter finals with him, first time ever in the country’s history. 

In [[2000]], [[Fenerbahçe]] offered him a position, and at the end of the season [[2000]]-[[2001]], Fenerbahçe won the league championship title after 5 years again. Denizli is the first Turkish coach of Fenerbahçe ever to win the league championship, but he enjoyed a rather poor [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] run with defeats against [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Bayer Leverkusen]]. In 2002 the [[Nigerian national football team]] wanted to sign Denizli for their [[2002 Fifa World Cup|2002 World Cup]] campaign but due to several problems it was canceld. He then transferred to Vestel Manisaspor. 

In [[2004]], Denizli received several offers from [[Japan]] and [[South-Korea]], but he chose to use his knowledge for [[Iran]] to coach the [[Iran's Premier Football League|premier league]] champion [[Pas Tehran]]. Denizli made a run for the league title but became only second in the league. There were rumours that Denizli would be the coach of the [[Iran national football team]] to lead it to a successful [[2006 Fifa World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. He also reached the quarterfinals of the [[AFC Champions League]] with Pas, where he was knocked out 4-4 on aggregate by [[Al Ain FC|Al Ain]]. Denizli said he was going to leave Pas and headback for Turkey, although he had an option to sign a contract in [[Dubai]]. It was said that Mustafa Denizli would take over the Iranian national team after [[Branko Ivankovic]] failed to make an impression on the world stage, but the [[Iran]]ian [[Amir Ghalenoei]] was chosen over him. In August 2006, Denizli was hired as the manager of the Iranian club, [[Persepolis F.C.]], after [[Arie Haan]] was fired. He resigned on [[June 3]], [[2007]] after an unsuccesful season with [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] in which he failed in the [[Hazfi Cup]] with an embarrassing 4-1 defeat to [[Sepahan F.C.|Sepahan]] and more importantly the [[Iran's Premier Football League|IPL]] in which his immensely talented team only managed a 3rd place finish.

Denizli has recently announced he is very interested in becoming Iran National football team manager, providing he can reach agreements with the IRIFF.[http://www.iranproleague.net/news/Morenews.cfm?News=3573]
