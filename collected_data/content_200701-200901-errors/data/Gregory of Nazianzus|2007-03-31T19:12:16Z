Saint '''Gregory of Nazianzus''' ([[329]] - [[January 25]], [[389]]), also known as Saint '''Gregory the Theologian''' or '''Gregory Nazianzen''' was a [[4th century]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishop]] of [[List of Constantinople patriarchs|Constantinople]]. He was the son of Gregory and Nonna. He is honored as a [[saint]] by the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]] and as a [[Doctor of the Church]].  He is also a highly-regarded saint in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

==Education==
He first studied at home with his uncle [[Saint Amphylokhios]]. Later he studied in [[Nazianzus]] (where his father Gregory was bishop), [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]] [[Cappadocia]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Athens]]. While at Athens, he developed a close friendship with Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] and also made the acquaintance of Julian, the later emperor who would become known as [[Julian the Apostate]]. Upon finishing his education, he also taught rhetoric in Athens for a short time.

==Service==
In [[361]], Gregory returned to Nazianzus and was ordained a presbyter (elder or priest). He spent some time in the wilderness with Basil practicing asceticism, but later returned to care for the Christian parishes in Nazianzus. Basil later made him Bishop of Sasima. In [[378]], the Antioch Council asked Gregory to come to Constantinople as archbishop, as the preceding archbishop had recently died. With the consent of Basil, he agreed. At the time, there were many [[Arianism|Arians]] and [[Apollinarianism|Apollinarians]] in the city, both of which heresies were soon to be denounced in [[381]] at the second [[Ecumenical Council]]. But in [[379]], the night before Easter, a mob of armed heretics burst into Gregory's church during worship services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop.

==Theology and other works==

In his theology, Gregory advocated the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], including the full divinity of both [[Jesus]] and the [[Holy Spirit]]. He emphasized that Jesus did not cease to be God when he became a man, nor did he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature. Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul.  He also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the [[Old Testament]] but much clearer since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at the feast of Pentecost. Gregory of Nazianzus is given the title 'Gregory the Theologian' by Eastern Orthodoxy, a title he shares with [[John the Apostle]], also known as John the Theologian. He is widely quoted by Eastern Orthodox theologians and highly regarded as a defender of the Christian faith.

Apart from the several theological discourses, Gregory is also one of the most important early Christian man of letters, a very accomplished orator, perhaps one of the greatest of his time, and also a very prolific poet, having written several poems with theological and moral matter and some with biographical content, about himself and about his friends.

One of the famous patristic quotes of Gregory Nazianzen that have some bearing on the "controversial" First and Second Vatican Councils' doctrines of papal and conciliar infallibility [the first of which was responsible for the schism between the Roman Catholics and the Old Catholics and which remains perhaps the single most important ecumenical barrier to reunion between the Roman Catholic and Anglican Communions] is: <blockquote>I am of a mind to shun every assemblage of Bishops...for I have never seen any good come of a Council not remedy of evil but addition thereof...there are contentions and strivings...beyond description.</blockquote>

==Death==
Following his death, Saint Gregory's body was buried at Nazianzus. His relics were transferred to [[Constantinople]] in 950, into the church of the Holy Apostles. Part of the relics were taken from Constantinople by [[Crusade]]rs during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in [[1204]] and ended up in [[Rome]]. On [[27 November]] [[2004]], those relics were returned (along with the relics of [[John Chrysostom]]) to [[Istanbul]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] (though the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] retained a small portion of the relics). The relics are now enshrined in the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Patriarchal]] Cathedral of St. George in the [[Fanar]].
