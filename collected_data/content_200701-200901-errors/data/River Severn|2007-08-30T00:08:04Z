:''For other rivers named "Severn", see [[Severn River]].''
The '''River Severn''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Afon [[Hafren]]'', [[Latin|Latin]]: ''Sabrina'') is the longest [[United Kingdom|British]] [[river]], at {{convert|220|mi|km|0}}.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/england/sevenwonders/west/severn-river/| title=The River Severn Facts| author=BBC| accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> It rises at an altitude of {{convert|2001|ft|m|0}} on [[Plynlimon]] near [[Llanidloes]], in the [[Cambrian Mountains]], [[Mid Wales]], and it passes through a number of English counties, with the [[county town|county towns]] of [[Shrewsbury]], [[Worcester]], and [[Gloucester]] located on its banks. With an average discharge of 107&nbsp;m³/s at [[Apperley]], [[Gloucestershire]], the Severn is [[England]]'s greatest river in terms of water flow, and is considered one of the ten major rivers of the [[United Kingdom]].

The river becomes the [[River Severn#Severn estuary|Severn estuary]] after the Second Severn Crossing near [[Aust]], [[Gloucestershire]]. The river then discharges into the [[Bristol Channel]] which in turn  discharges into the [[Celtic Sea]] and the wider [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The Severn's drainage basin area is 11,420 square kilometres (4,409 mi²), excluding the [[River Wye]] and [[River Avon, Bristol|Bristol Avon]] which flow into the Bristol Channel. The major tributaries to the Severn are the [[River Vyrnwy|Vyrnwy]], [[River Teme|Teme]], [[Upper Avon|Warwickshire Avon]] and [[River Stour|Stour]].

==Mythology==
[[Image:SevernSource06.JPG|thumb|right|The source of the River Severn in the Winter of 2006.]]
According to some sources, the name "Severn" is derived from the name Sabrina or ([[Hafren]]), based on the mythical story of the drowning of a nymph in the river.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.geocities.com/andymorrall/sabrina.htm| title=The Legend of Sabrina| author=Andy Morrall| accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> Sabrina is also the goddess of the River Severn in [[Insular Brythonic mythology|Brythonic mythology]]. The story of Sabrina is featured in [[John Milton|Milton]]'s [[Comus (John Milton)|''Comus'']].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/sabrina.htm| author=Liam Rogers| title=Sabrina and the River Severn| accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> There is a statue of 'Sabrina' in the Dingle Gardens at the [[The Quarry|Quarry]], [[Shrewsbury]].

As the Severn becomes tidal the associated deity changes to Noadu, who (Romanized as [[Nodens]]) is represented mounted on a [[seahorse]], riding on the crest of the Severn [[tidal bore | bore]].<ref>Clucas, P. (1985) ''Britain - The Landscape Below''. Guildford: Colour Library Books. ISBN 0-86283-174-1</ref>

==Tributary rivers==
The [[River Stour, Worcestershire|River Stour]] rises in the north of Worcestershire in the [[Clent Hills]], near St Kenelm's Church at Frankley.  It flows north into the adjacent [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] at [[Halesowen]]. It then flows westwards through [[Cradley Heath]] and [[Stourbridge]] where it leaves the [[Black Country]].  It is joined by the Smestow Brook at Prestwood before it winds around southwards to [[Kinver]], and then flows back into Worcestershire.  It then passes through [[Wolverley]], [[Kidderminster]] and [[Wilden]] to its [[confluence]] with the Severn at [[Stourport-on-Severn]].

The [[River Vyrnwy]], which begins at [[Lake Vyrnwy]], flows eastwards through [[Powys]] before entering England and joining the Severn at [[Melverley]], [[Shropshire]]. The [[Rea Brook]] flows north from its source in the [[Shropshire Hills]] and joins the Severn at [[Shrewsbury]]. The [[River Tern]], after flowing south from [[Market Drayton]] and being joined by the [[River Roden]], meets the Severn at [[Attingham Park]]. 

The [[River Teme]] flows eastwards from its source in [[Mid Wales]], straddling the border between [[Shropshire]] and [[Herefordshire]], it is joined by the [[River Onny]], [[River Corve]] and [[River Rea, Shropshire|River Rea]] before it finally joins the Severn slightly downstream of [[Worcester, England|Worcester]].

One of the several rivers named Avon, in this case the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|Warwickshire Avon]], flows west through [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], [[Warwick]] and [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. It is then joined by its tributary the [[River Arrow (Worcestershire)|River Arrow]], before finally  joining the Severn at [[Tewkesbury]], [[Gloucestershire]]. 

The port of [[Bristol]] is located at the mouth of the Severn, where another [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] flows into it through the [[Avon Gorge]]. 

The [[River Wye]], from its source in [[Plynlimon]], [[Wales]], flows generally southeast through the Welsh towns of [[Rhayader]] and [[Builth Wells]]. It then enters [[Herefordshire]], and flows through [[Hereford]], and is shortly afterwards joined by the [[River Lugg]], before flowing south into the Severn slightly upstream of the [[Bristol Avon]]. It then forms the boundary between England, specifically the [[Forest of Dean]], and [[Wales]], with the town of [[Chepstow]] at the confluence, giving an important strategic position in yesteryear and was the main road into South Wales, before the two bridges were built. 

The [[River Usk]] flows into the Severn estuary just south of [[Newport]].

==Major settlements==
Below is a list of major [[town]]s and cities that the Severn flows through (from [[north]] to [[south]]):
*Through '''[[Powys]]''':
** [[Newtown]]
** [[Welshpool]]
*Through '''[[Shropshire]]'''

** [[Ironbridge]]
** [[Bridgnorth]]

==Transport==
===Bridges===
{{main|Crossings of the River Severn}}
[[Image:Porthill Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Porthill Bridge]] in [[Shrewsbury]], [[Shropshire]].]]
[[image:Severn_Aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Severn crossing|Severn bridges]] crossing near the mouth of the '''River Severn''']]

The Severn is bridged at many places, and many of these bridges are notable in their own right, with several designed and built by the engineer [[Thomas Telford]]. There also is the very famous [[Ironbridge]] at [[Coalbrookdale]], which is the first ever Iron Bridge in the world.

The two bridges of the [[Severn crossing]] carrying roads (opened in 1966 and 1996) link [[Wales]] with the southern counties of [[England]] and are among the most important in Britain. 
*[[Severn Bridge]] &mdash; opened in 1966 carrying the [[M48 motorway|M48]]
*[[Second Severn Crossing]] &mdash; opened in 1996 carrying the [[M4 motorway|M4]] [[motorway]]

Previous to the construction of the first bridge in 1966, the channel was crossed by the [[Aust Ferry]].

===Rail===
The [[Severn Tunnel]], situated near the [[Second Severn Crossing]] road bridge, carries the [[Great Western Main Line]] under the channel.

Cars could also be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between [[Severn Tunnel Junction railway station|Severn Tunnel Junction]] and [[Pilning railway station|Pilning]]. The vehicles were loaded onto open flat bed carriages and pulled by a small [[Tank locomotive#Pannier tank|pannier tank locomotive]] although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle with a sheet as sparks often flew when the [[steam locomotive]] tackled the grade leading to the tunnel exit. A rail coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings in the early 1950s.

===Disasters===
There have been many [[disasters on the Severn]], making it Britain's most dangerous river. It has claimed many lives (figures vary depending on how it is recorded, circa 300 people), especially during the 20th century.{{fact|date=July 2007}}

===Locks===
There are locks on the lower Severn to enable sea going boats to reach as far as [[Stourport]]. The most northerly lock is at Lincombe, about a mile downstream from Stourport.

===Associated canals===
The [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]], the [[Worcester and Birmingham Canal]], and the [[Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal]] all join the Severn at [[Stourport-on-Severn|Stourport]], [[Worcester]] and [[Gloucester]] respectively. The [[Droitwich Canal|Droitwich Barge Canal]] used to join the Severn at [[Hawford]], near to the [[River Salwarpe]] and it hoped that a new link to the Severn via the Salwarpe will be re-established in the future.

===Paddle steamers===
The main operator of pleasure craft and particularly [[paddle steamer]]s on the river from the mid-1800's to the late 1970's were [[P and A Campbell]] of [[Bristol]], but also included the [[Barry Railway Company]]. There were also three ferries operating between Aust and Chepstow these were called the Severn King, Severn Queen and Severn Princess. The Severn Princess is [[2006|currently]] undergoing restoration after being found in Ireland full of fertiliser, after dragging her back with her sinking twice on the way it is hoped that at some time in the near future she will be fully operational again. The Severn King and Queen were scrapped not long after their decommission following the completion of the First Severn Bridge.

In Worcester, the Worcester River Cruises have boat trips up and down the river operating the boats The Pride of the Midlands and The Earl Grosvenor. After 2008 there are plans for another boat, The Severn Travellor, to be refurbished and relaunched for trips.

==Severn estuary==
The River Severn extends down to the [[Second Severn Crossing]]. The estuary begins at this point and stretches to a line from [[Lavernock Point]] (south of [[Cardiff]]) to [[Sand Point, Somerset|Sand Point]] near [[Weston-super-Mare]]. West of this line is the [[Bristol Channel]]. In the Severn estuary (or the [[Bristol Channel]] in the last two cases, depending where the boundary is drawn) are the rocky islands called [[Denny Island]], [[Steep Holm]] and [[Flat Holm]].

==Severn bore==
A curious phenomenon associated with the lower reaches of the Severn is the [[tidal bore]].  The '''Severn bore''' forms somewhat upstream of the Port of [[Sharpness]], which is also the Southern terminus of the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]]. 

The river's [[estuary]], which empties into the [[Bristol Channel]], has the second largest [[tidal range]] in the world &mdash; about {{convert|15|m|ft|0}},<ref>{{cite web | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/4927744.stm | title= Backing for Severn barrage power | date= [[22 April]] [[2006]] | work= [[BBC News]] | accessdate= 2007-08-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2005/07/04/bristolchannel_feature.shtml | title= Coast: Bristol Channel | work= BBC | accessdate= 2007-08-27 }}</ref>
exceeded only by the [[Bay of Fundy]] in [[Canada]] &mdash; and during the highest tides, the rising water is funnelled up the estuary into a wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current. The largest bores occur in spring, but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. A timetable and prediction of bore heights can be found on the Environment Agency website (see External links section below). Being the onset of the flood tide it is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed. The Severn Bore is a natural example of a self-reinforcing solitary wave or [[soliton]]. 

[[River surfing]] enthusiasts even attempt to surf along on the wave, which can be {{convert|2|m|ft|0}}. In March 2006, an ''unofficial'' record surf was achieved, for the longest-ever 'surf', by Steve King, a railway engineer from [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]]. Despite the media acceptance of the record <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.severnsolutions.co.uk/twblog/archive/2006/04/17/severnborerecord| author=Tom Wright| title=Severn Bore World Surfing Record| accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref> the exact distance of the ride was never verified and the record was later rejected by both the British Surfing Association and ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. (Note that the Gloucester Harbour Trustees, as competent harbour authority for this part of the river, explicitly advise against this pastime.)

==Tidal Power==
{{main|Severn Barrage}}
A huge tidal range and high level of surrounding industry and population have long made the Severn estuary and [[Bristol Channel]] a focus for [[tidal power|tidal energy]] schemes and ideas. Plans for a [[Severn Barrage]] &mdash; running 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;miles) across the Bristol Channel from [[Lavernock Point]] near to and south west of [[Cardiff]] to [[Brean Down]] near and just south west of [[Weston-super-Mare]] in [[Somerset]] &mdash; would generate a massive 8640&nbsp;MW when the tide flows, and have been discussed for several decades now.  The power generated, coming from a lake of {{convert|185|sqmi|sqkm|0}} and {{convert|14|m|ft|0}} potential energy depth, would be equivalent to 12 nuclear power stations. Tidal power only runs for some 10 hours a day, but by using the enclosed lake as a reservoir of potential energy more hours of operation could be achieved. Other energy sources, such as wind and solar power, also create electricity at times that do not always match when it is needed. Excess power could be stored by pumping water uphill, as is already done at a variety of other installations in the UK. 

The UK Government shelved the plans in the late 1980s due largely to cost issues and local environmental concerns. However, this was before recent huge rises in the price of energy, and before [[Global Warming]] had started to be taken seriously. In April 2006 the [[Welsh Assembly]] approved the idea of utilising the tidal power, but the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|RSPB]] has raised serious concerns about the effect on the mud flats, that have European Environmental protection status, and the UK government Energy Review published later in the year did not endorse the scheme. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/4927744.stm| title=Backing for Severn barrage power| author=BBC News| date=21 April 2006|accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref>

Because global warming and nuclear power station waste and decommissioning have such vast environmental effects, the small environmental impact of the Severn Barrage is an overall reduction in impact{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Further work is required to decrease the environmental impact of the project, although there are many people living in Somerset and Wales that think the project will ruin the picturesque surroundings that so many people have enjoyed, so there is increased anger at the proposal{{Fact|date=March 2007}} to build a barrage across the river.

==Industry==
A six-mile stretch of the [[Severn valley]] in [[Shropshire]], known as the [[Ironbridge|Ironbridge Gorge]],  was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1986.  Its historic importance is due to its role as the centre of the [[iron]] industry in the early stages of the [[Industrial Revolution]].  Ironbridge gets its name from the bridge across the Severn, built in 1779, which was the first cast-iron bridge ever constructed.

==Wildlife==
The sides of the estuary are also important feeding grounds for [[wader]]s, notably at the [[Bridgwater Bay]] [[National Nature Reserves in England|National Nature Reserve]] and the [[WWT Slimbridge|Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust]].
