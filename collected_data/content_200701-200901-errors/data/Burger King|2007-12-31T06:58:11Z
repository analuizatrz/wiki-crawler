The [[Burger King products|Burger King menu]] has evolved from a simple offering of burgers, fries, sodas and milkshakes in 1954 to a larger, more diverse set of offerings that includes several variations of [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[salad]]s and [[breakfast]].

===History===
Burger King's first restaurant, originally called '''Insta Burger King''', was opened on [[December 4]], [[1954]] in a suburb of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]] by James McLamore and David Edgerton who were both alumni of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]]. McLamore had visited the original McDonald's hamburger stand belonging to [[Dick and Mac McDonald]] in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[California]]; sensing potential in their innovative [[assembly line]]-based production system, he decided to create a version of his own. By 1959, BK had grown to five regional stores in and around the metropolitan Miami area. About this time, McLamore and Edgerton decided to expand BK nationally by using a franchising system that had become a popular method for expansion due to its low capital cost for the parent company. They formed Burger King Corporation as the parent and began selling territorial franchise licenses to private owners across the US.<ref name="answers">{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/burger-king |title=History of Burger King Corporation |author=[http://www.fundinguniverse.com FundingUniverse.com] |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> 
[[Image:Burgerkingrestaurant.jpg|thumb|right|A Burger King restaurant in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[California]]]]
In 1967, after eight years of private operation, the [[Pillsbury Company]] acquired Burger King and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, BK had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States. While BK began its foray in to locations outside of the [[continental United States]] in 1963 with a store in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], it did not have a large international presence. This situation changed shortly after the acquisition when Pillsbury opened its first international restaurant in [[Canada]] in 1969. Other international locations followed soon after: [[Oceania]] in 1971 with Hungry Jack's and in [[Europe]] in 1975 with a restaurant in [[Madrid, Spain]]. Beginning in 1982, BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several [[East Asian]] countries, including [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and [[Korea]].<ref name="answers"/> Due to high competition, many of the Japanese locations closed by the end of 2001. BK reentered the Japanese market in mid-2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/news/story.phtml?id=5523 |title=Burger King back in Japan after 6 years |author=Yuri Kageyama |publisher=QSR Magazine |date=[[2007-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref> BK's [[Central American|Central]] and [[South American]] operations began in [[Mexico]] in the late 1970s.<ref name="answers"/> 

Since the time that Pillsbury bought Burger King, BK has been the object of a series of failed and successful acquisitions and divestitures. In 1973, Chart House, owner of 350 BK restaurants at the time and one of BK's largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100 million ([[USD]]). When Chart House's bid failed, its owners, Billy and Jimmy Trotter, suggested that Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective Burger King holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company, an offer Pillsbury also declined. After the failed attempts to acquire BK, the relationship with Chart House and the Trotters began to sour; in 1979 BK successfully sued Chart House for improperly acquiring locations in Boston and Houston.<ref name="answers"/> In 1984, Pillsbury purchased Chart House's successor DiversiFoods for $390 million ([[USD]]) after a separate, independent $525 million DiversiFoods management-backed [[leveraged buy-out]] of the company failed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v19/ai_3930610 |title=How Pillsbury 'stole' DiversiFoods for just $390 million |author=Rick Telberg |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=[[1985-09-09]] |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02EFDA1238F931A25751C1A962948260 |title=DiversiFoods Net |publisher=New York Times |date=[[1984-12-12]] |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref>

In 1989, under the ownership of Grand Met, Burger King acquired many locations of its major [[UK]] rival [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] when the parent company bought the Wimpy's brand from its previous owner [[United Biscuits]] and re-branded them as Burger King, giving it an even greater presence in that country. While other "Wimpy" locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence they once did.<ref name="answers"/> In 1997, Grand Metropolitan merged with [[Guinness]] to form a company called [[Diageo]]. Diageo maintained ownership of BKC until 2001 when Diageo decided to focus solely on their beverage products and divest itself of the chain.

By the time of the sale, Burger King's revenues and market share had declined significantly, Burger King had fallen to a near tie for second place with rival [[Wendy's]] in the US market for hamburger chain restaurants.<ref name="slate">{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2102906/ |title=What's wrong with Burger King |author=Daniel Gross |publisher=Slate.com |date=[[2004-06-24]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> For many years leading into the early 2000s Burger King and its various owners plus many of its larger franchises closed many under-performing stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE123EF93BA35752C0A96E948260 |title=Pillsbury  restaurants cutbacks set |author=Calvin Sims |publisher=The New York Times |date=1988-01-08 |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> Several of its largest franchises entered bankruptcy due to the issues surrounding the performance of the brand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_33_23/ai_77757921 |title=Franchisee of Burger Chain Files Chap. 11 |author =Anthony Palazzo |publisher=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=[[2001-08-21]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E7D6153BF936A35751C1A9649C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Fast%20Food%20Industry |title=Big Burger King Franchise chain files for bankruptcy |author= |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[2002-12-05]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref>

==Hungry Jack's==
[[Image:Hungry Jack's logo.png|120px|thumb|right|Hungry Jack's current logo.]]
{{Main|Hungry Jack's}}

'''Hungry Jack's''' (sometimes colloquially abbreviated to HJ's) is the exclusive Australian franchisee of Burger King Corporation. Its parent company is Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Competitive Foods Australia, a privately held company owned by [[Jack Cowin]].

The Hungry Jack's branding results from a small [[takeaway]] shop in [[Queensland]] having registered the Australian trademark for the name ''Burger King''. Thus, BK was forced to change the name when it decided to open stores in the country - the only time this has happened in its corporate history. ''Hungry Jack'' was the name of a Pillsbury product, the then-parent of Burger King, being used in the US to market [[pancake]] (flapjack) mixture, and Cowin presumably chose that branding as a reflection of his own name. The first Hungry Jack's, with the [[possessive apostrophe]] "''s''", opened in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1971.<ref name="bkcau>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4275422-1.html |title=Burger King Re-flags Australian Stores |author=Restaurant Business News |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=[[2003-05-30]] |accessdate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> 

Claiming that Hungry Jack's had violated the conditions of the 1991 renewed franchise agreement in regard to the expansion of the chain, Burger King Corporation, in partnership with [[Royal Dutch Shell]], began to open its own stores in Australia in 1996. In a counter-claim that BKC had breached the conditions of their franchise agreement, Cowin sued and won.<ref name="zesb">{{cite web |url=http://www.zarcolaw.com/CM/News/news26.asp |title=Burger King Hit With Whopper ($44.6 Million) Of A Judgment |author=Alina Matas |publisher=Zargo Einhorn Salkowski & Brito.

TPF subsequently renamed the remaining BK locations to Hungry Jack's, operating them that way for four more years when it chose to exit Australia and sell its operations to Cowin's company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2003/05/26/daily36.html |title=In Australia, Burger King to become 'Hungry Jack's' |publisher=South Florida Business Journal, |date=[[2003-05-30]] |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> 

Hungry Jack's currently owns and operates or sub-licenses over 300 restaurants in Australia. No Australian restaurants now operate under the Burger King name.

==Controversies, disputes and legal issues==
As with other [[multi-national corporation]]s, Burger King has had its share of controversies and legal issues over the course of its existence. Issues have included trademark disputes, controversies with animal rights groups, health issues, packaging issues and labor laws. Many of these issues have helped Burker King grow as a socially responsible corporation, while others may have hurt them in some markets.

===Trademark disputes===
As the company grew, it encountered several issues in regard to [[trademarks]], the most famous two incidents occurred with the similarly named [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)|Burger King]] in [[Mattoon, Illinois]] and now defunct take-out (take-away) Burger King restaurant in Queensland, Australia.

The Mattoon trademark dispute is probably the most important of the disputes because of the effect it had setting [[legal precedent]] in regard to the [[Lanham Act]] in the US under the case ''Burger King of Florida, Inc. v. Hoots (1968)''.<ref name="kiley-decision">{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uconn.edu/homes/swilf/ip/cases/burger.htm |title=''Burger King of Florida, Inc. v.

}}</ref> Gene and Betty Hoots owned an [[ice cream]] shop in the city of Mattoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop next to the original location. In keeping with the name of the ice cream shop, ''Frigid Queen'', they named their burger stand ''Burger King'' and registered their [[trademark]] with the [[state of Illinois]] in 1959.<ref name="hoots">{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A2686 |title=The burger king and queen of Mattoon |author=John Jermaine |publisher=the Illinois Times |date=[[2003-11-20]] |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> 

Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening locations in Illinois in 1961, and by 1967 had over twenty locations in areas in the state. The Hootses, claiming that their trademark gave them exclusive rights to the name in Illinois sued BK in the state, and later federal, courts. The decision of the federal court was that the BKC federal trademark, received in 1963, took precedence over the Hootses' state trademark; The Hootses were granted exclusive rights to the Burger King trade mark in 20 mile (32 km) of their original location in Mattoon.<ref name="hoots"/><ref>The court cited numerous examples where the federal law explicitly gave federal trademarks stronger weight than other kinds.  See, for example, {{USC|15|1127}}: "The intent of this chapter is ... to protect registered marks used in such commerce from interference by State, or territorial legislation."</ref>

{{details|Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)}}

When Burger King decided to expand its operations into [[Australia]], it found that its business name was already [[trademark]]ed by a man running a small takeaway food shop in [[Queensland]]. As a result, Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, [[Jack Cowin]], with a list of possible alternative names that the Australian Burger King restaurants could be branded as. The names were derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury. Cowin selected the "Hungry Jack" brand name, one of Pillsbury's US [[pancake]] mixture products, and slightly changing the name to a [[possessive form]] by adding an [[apostrophe#Possessive apostrophe|apostrophe]] '[[s]]' thus forming the new name '''Hungry Jack's'''. Accordingly, the first Australian franchise of the Burger King Corporation, established in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1971, was branded as Hungry Jack's.<ref name="bkcau>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4275422-1.html |title=Burger King Re-flags Australian Stores |author=Restaurant Business News |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=[[2003-05-30]] |accessdate=2007-09-29 }}</ref>

Like many of its competitors, BK has also been targeted by various animal welfare groups, such as [[PETA]], over the treatment of the animals it uses in manufacture of its ingredients. In a concession to these groups, BK will be switching suppliers for several of its raw animal products, e.g., eggs and pork-based products, to those who use cage-free production methods.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2987450 |title=Burger King Offers Cage-Free Food. |author=AP Wire |publisher=Associated Press |date=[[2007-03-28]] |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> 

Several groups have argued that BK has contributed to the western [[obesity]] epidemic by introducing products that contain large amounts of [[fat]], [[trans-fat]] and calories. In recent years, BK has begun introducing several large, over-sized products including its European [[BK XXL]] line, [[Enormous Omelet Sandwich]] line and the [[BK Stacker]] line. These products, and others like them, have brought international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats.<ref name="komo">{{cite web |url=http://www.komoradio.com/news/archive/4191016.html |title=Burger King Launches Line Of Jumbo High-Rise Burgers |author=Herb Weisbaum |publisher=KOMO Radio ([[Seattle, WA]]) |date=[[2006-07-06]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref><ref name="usat">{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2005-03-27-burger-king_x.htm | title=Burger King to offer whopper of a breakfast sandwich |author=Bruce Horovitz |publisher=USA TODAY |date=[[2005-05-03]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref><ref name="sr">{{cite web |url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/blogs/healthbeat/archive.asp?postID=761 |title=Word of the day: Meat'Normous |publisher=the Spokesman Review ([[Spokane, WA]]) |author=Heather Lalley |date=[[2005-09-06]] |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> Many groups, including the [[American Heart Association]], the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] and the [[Spain|Spanish]] government, have accused BK and [[McDonald's#Criticism|other fast food restaurant chains]] of failing to provide healthier alternatives and contribution the ongoing obesity epidemic in the West.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070517/burgerking_transfat_070517/20070517?hub=Health |title=Burger King responds to trans-fat cooking oil suit |author=AP Wire |publisher=CTV |date=[[2007-05-17]] |accessdate=2007-09-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/16/ap/health/mainD8LE8I081.shtml |title=Spain Nixes Burger King Ad |author=AP Wire |publisher=CBS News |date=[[2006-11-16]] |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> 

In a partial response, Burger King announced that it was joining [[Better Business Bureau|The Council of Better Business Bureaus]] Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative. The program is a voluntary self-regulation program designed to shift advertising messages aimed at children so that they encourage healthier eating habits and lifestyles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbbb.org/initiative/index.asp |title=Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative |author= |publisher=The Council of Better Business Bureaus |date= |accessdate=2007-10-04 }}</ref> In a press statement, BKC announced that it will be taking the following steps in regard to its children's advertising:

<blockquote>In addition, Burger King Corp. will:

====Islam====
An issue of a religious nature arose in the UK when BK introduced a new prepackaged ice cream product; the label of the product included a silhouette of the ice cream that when rotated on its side bore a resemblance to the [[Islamic]] inscription for [[Allah|God]]. Several local Muslim groups pointed out the issue of the possible interpretation and Burger King voluntarily recalled the product and reissued it with a new label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1951292005 |title=Burger King recalls 'sacrilegious' desserts |author=John Innes |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=[[2005-09-07]] |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> Another issue that arose with the Islamic community was over an [[Israel]]i franchise opening stores in [[Israeli-occupied territories|the Occupied territories]]. When the Israeli BK franchisee Rikamor, Ltd. opened a store in the [[West Bank]] settlement of [[Ma'aleh Adumim]], many Islamic groups argued that BKC licensing of the store helped legitimize the settlement. BKC quickly pulled the franchise license for that location and had the store shuttered saying that Rikamor, Ltd. had violated its contract by opening the location in the West Bank. Several American-based Jewish groups issued statements that denounced the decision as kowtowing to threats of boycotts by Islamic groups. In a statement issued by BK Corporation, Burger King stated that it "made this decision purely on a commercial basis and in the best interests of thousands of people who depend on the Burger King reputation for their livelihood."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/11939/edition_id/230/format/html/displaystory.html |title=Dumping West Bank store puts Burger King in a pickle |author=Julia Goldman |publisher=The Jewish News Weekly |date=[[1999-09-01]] |accessdate=2007-10-01 }}</ref>

====Labor====
Labor issues and disputes have arisen in various parts of the world, primarily over wages. In South Florida, the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]], (CIW) has organized protests against Burger King and other [[fast food restaurant|QSR]] chains in response to the dismissal of the group's demands for increased pay raise of 1Â¢ per pound for tomato pickers in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070929/NEWS01/70929017/1075 |title= Burger King protest plays out in SFM |author=Jacob Ogles |publisher=[[The News-Press]] |date=[[2007-09-27]] |accessdate=2007-10-02}}</ref> Burger King's response was that while it is a larger purchaser, BKC is not responsible for the pay rates of the workers of its suppliers as wages disputes are the province of the said producer. BKC also offered employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships through its Have it Your Way Foundation for family members of CIW workers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/content/news/detail.aspx?id=899 |title=Burger King Corporation Issues "Penny per Pound" Statement |author=BKC press release |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date=[[2007-02-05]] |accessdate=2007-10-04 }}</ref>

==Charitable contributions and services==
Burger King has several of its own in-house national [[charitable organization]]s and programs. The first is the Have It Your Way Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit, [[501(c)(3)]] corporation with multiple focuses on hunger alleviation, disease prevention and community education through scholarship programs at colleges in the US. The other charitable organization is the McLamore Foundation, also a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation that provides scholarships to students in the US and its territories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/community/hiywfoundation.aspx |title=the HIYW foundation |author= |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date= |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/community/mclamore.aspx |title=the McLamore Foundation |author= |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date= |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> Additionally, there is an optional literacy program that partners individual restaurants with community schools in the US.

On the local level, BK supports several regional charitable organizations covering several various causes. In the [[Boston, MA|Boston]] region, BK has affiliated itself with the [[Boston Red Sox]] [[Jimmy Fund]], a charity that supports juvenile [[cancer]] research at the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] in Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmyfund.org/cor/special/burger/default.html |title=Burger King A Chance for Kids |author= |publisher=The Jimmy Fund |date=[[2007-07-01]] |accessdate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> In the [[Pittsburgh, PA|Pittsburgh]] region it contributes to the Burger King Cancer Caring Center, a support organization for the patients, families and friends of cancer patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancercaring.org/aboutbkccc.html |title=Burger King Cancer Caring Center |author= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> 

==Products==
{{main|Burger King products}}
When the company began, its menu consisted predominantly of [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[soft drink]]s, and [[dessert]]s. Beginning with the [[Whopper]] sandwich in 1957, BK has expanded the breadth of its menu by adding various non-beef items like [[chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[vegetarian]] offerings such as [[salads]] and meatless [[sandwiches]]; a [[breakfast]] menu; and non-[[soft drink]] beverages such as [[Icee]]s, [[juices]] and [[bottled water]]s. Additionally, as the company expanded both inside and outside the US, it introduced [[Globalization|localized versions]] of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK will occasionally introduce limited time offers (LTO) of special versions of its products or bring out completely new products intended for either long or short term sales. Not all these products and services have been successful, in 1994 Burger King introduced limited [[table service]] and special [[dinner]] platters; the concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.<ref name="nyt1">{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50F14F83E550C7B8EDDA10894DF494D81 |title=As Business Gets Lean, a Big King Dares Big Mac |author=Glenn Collins |publisher=New York Times |date=[[1997-08-28]] |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> 

In 1957, BK added its signature item, the [[Whopper]]. This quarter pound [[hamburger]] was created by Burger King founders [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]] as a way to differentiate BK from other burger outlets at the time. The sandwich became famous enough that BK eventually adopted the motto "Home of the Whopper."

By 1979, BK had significantly expanded the breadth of its menu with many non-hamburger sandwiches including chicken, fish, desserts and breakfast products. Like all QSR outlets, BK has also modified its core menu with variants on its sandwiches, LTO products and items that cater to specific dietary needs. In 1985, BK again expanded its menu offerings by adding new products such as [[French toast]] sticks, the [[Croissan'Wich]] and [[BK Chicken Tenders]]. BK has also modified some of its core menu products, adding variations on products like the Whopper so that there are many "standard" sizes and varieties.

In 1997 Burger King launched their new french fry line, which featured a clear coating made from a potato-based starch to 7,400 U.S. locations. Burger King also rolled out a large U.S. advertising campaign to advertise the new french fries. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets. These new french fries are still in use.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n51_v31/ai_20105790 | title=Burger King attacks McD with french-fry launch |author=Mark Hamstra |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News|date=[[1997-12-22]] |accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> 

In 1998, US BK added a 99Â¢ ([[USD]]) Great Tastes menu to better compete with QSR competitor, [[Wendy's]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/prnewswire/access/27375113.html?dids=27375113:27375113&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+16%2C+1998&author=&pub=PR+Newswire&desc=Burger+King+Debuts+New+99+Cent+'Great+Tastes'+Menu&pqatl=google |title=Burger King Debuts New 99Â¢ 'Great Tastes' Menu |author=AP Wire |publisher=[[The Kansas City Star]] |date=[[1998-03-17]] |accessdate=2007-10-09 }}</ref> This value menu featured seven products: Whopper Jr., 5 piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium sized french fries, medium soft drink, medium onion rings and small shake. In 2002, BK renamed it the 99Â¢ ([[USD]]) Value Menu revamped it to include a grilled sourdough burger, a bacon cheeseburger, small sized french fries and onion rings, small sized soft drinks, childs size shakes, chili, tacos, 5 piece Chicken Tenders, baked potatoes and a side garden salad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2002/09/09/daily63.html |title=Burger King promotes new menu |author= |publisher=South Florida Business Journal |date=[[2002-09-12]] |accessdate=2007-10-09 }}</ref> Many of the items have since been discontinued, modified or relegated to a regional menu option.<ref name="usrng">{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/Nutrition/PDFs/regional_menu.pdf |format=PDF| title=US Regional Menu Nutritional Brochure |author=BKC publication |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date=July 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> In 2006, the Value menu was again renamed, to the BK Value Menu, with products ranging from 99Â¢ to $1.50 ([[USD]]).

As part of its 2003 reorganization, BK introduced several new products to its menu, including several new or revamped chicken products, a new salad line and its BK Joe brand of coffee. Some of the new products, including its [[Enormous Omelet Sandwich]] line and the [[BK Stacker]] line, brought negative attention due the large portion size, amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats.<ref name="usat"/><ref name="sr"/><ref name="komo"/> 

As with other fast food companies, BK has recently begun introducing products that feature higher quality ingredients like whole chicken breast, Angus beef, natural [[cheese]]s such as [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] and [[Pepperjack|pepper jack]], and other menu fare that attempts to appeal to a more adult palate and demographic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_35_38/ai_n6189447 |title= Chains beef up with Black Angus |author=The Gale Group |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=[[2004-08-04]] |accessdate=2007-07-16 }}</ref><ref name="bk-clickz">{{cite web |url=http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3404771 |title=Burger King's Back With New Buzz |author=Kevin Newcomb  |publisher=ClickZ.com |date=[[2004-10-07]] |accessdate=2007-06-10 }}</ref> Again, not all these products have met corporate sales expectations.<ref name="BK-BBlum">{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2004-03-21-burgerking_x.htm |title=Burger King zaps menu, image |author=Bruce Horovitz |publisher=USA Today |date=[[2004-03-22]] |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref>

BK has had history of hits and misses in regard to its [[Burger King advertising|advertising]]: During the 1970s, BK introduced a memorable jingle, several well known and parodied [[slogans]] such as ''Have it your way '' and ''It takes two hands to hold a Whopper''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shephyken.blogspot.com/2006/05/hold-pickles-hold-lettuce-special.html |title=Customer service and more |author=Shep Hyken |date=[[2006-05-26]] |accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/content/corporation/history.html |title=Marketing and Advertising History |author=BKC publication |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date=[[2007-03-12]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> Starting in the early 1980s and running through approximately 2002, BK engaged a series of [[Advertising agency|ad agencies]] that produced many less than memorable slogans and programs, including its biggest advertising flop ''[[Where's Herb?]]''.<ref name="time"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/40104/ten_fast_food_fiascos.html |title=Ten Fast Food Fiascoes |author=Jason Rip |publisher=Associated Content |date=[[2006-06-19]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v20/ai_4083228 |title=Herb falls flat, but Wendy's breaks another winner |author=Mark Schoifet |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=[[1986-01-01]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> The 1990s saw a highly successful [[product tie-in|tie-in]] campaign with [[Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] animated films, including the [[Academy Award]] nominated [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty & the Beast]] and Academy Award winning [[Toy Story]].<ref name="answers"/>

The famous Burger King "bun halves" logo made its debut in 1969 and endured well into the 1990s. As its name implies, it was meant to resemble a [[hamburger]]: the logo had two orange semi-circular "buns" surrounding the name, which was the "meat" of the logo. In 1994 BK updated the logo with a graphical tightening, replacing the aging "bulging" font with a smoother font with rounded edges. In addition, all secondary signing, such as roof and directional signs, was also updated with new rounded font.

In 1999, BK again revised its logo. The new Burger King logo is a stylized version of the original "bun halves" logo. BK changed the color of the restaurant's name from orange to red lettering, while leaving them sandwiched between two yellow bun halves. The new logo also tilts the bun halves and the [[font]] on an [[Coordinate axis|axis]], has a smaller "bun" motif and wraps the burger with a blue crescent whipping around the buns giving it a more [[circular]] appearance. Most restaurants did not acquire newer signs with the new logo, menus, and drive-thru ordering speakers until 2001. Again all secondary signage was updated with the new logo and type face, and all sign posts were repainted to match the blue coloring of the new crescent from their original black.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr4-14bk.html |title=Burger King Shares Extensive Transformation Plans |author=BKC press release |publisher=BizJornals on Bison.com |date=[[1999-04-14]] |accessdate=2007-10-09 }}</ref>

The Hungry Jack's logo is based on the original Burger King "bun halves" design. HJ currently uses an updated version of the "bun halves" logo, featuring the smoother font used in the revised Burger King logo from 1994. Currently, the only region that BK uses non-Latin text is the Middle East. In those Arabic speaking countries the logo is reversed and uses Arabic characters; otherwise the logo is a mirror of the "blue crescent" logo used in the west.

Burger King has a longstanding presence at [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] installations worldwide, dating back to the 1980s under a contract with [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]].
