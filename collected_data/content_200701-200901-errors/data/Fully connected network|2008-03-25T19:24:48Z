A '''fully connected network''' is a [[mesh network]] in which each of the [[node (networking)|node]]s is connected to each other. A fully connected network doesn't need to use [[switching]] nor [[broadcasting (networks)|broadcasting]]. However, its major disadvantage is that the number of connections grows quadratically with the number of nodes, per formula

:<math>c= \frac{n^2-n}{2}.\, </math>

and so it is extremely impractical for large networks. A two-node network, one of the most common network types, is technically a fully connected network.
