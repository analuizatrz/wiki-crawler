The '''Lumière University Lyon 2''' ({{lang-fr|Université Lumière Lyon 2}}) is a French university, based in Lyon. It is part of the Academy of Lyon. A total of 27,500 students are studying there for a three-to-eight year degree.

==History==

At the end of the 18th century: Lyon didn't have a University. Education was still linked with religious [[congregations]] and influenced by the town's commercial, scientific and industrial requirements.

*1835 and 1838 : Creation of the Faculties of Science and Humanities. 

*1874 and 1875 : Creation of the Faculties of Medicine and Law.

*1896 : All these faculties were combined to form the University of Lyon. The same year, the historical buildings on the left bank of the Rhone were finished, initially dedicated to the faculties of medicine and science, then to the faculties of law and humanities. University of Lyon 2 is now established in part of these buildings.

*December 1969 : University Lyon 2 was created as a result of the [[Edgar Faure]] law of 1968, according to which each university must be a legally independent establishment. It comprised law, humanities and social sciences.
The number of students soon rose significantly. In such a demographic context, the University was extended in Bron, where a new campus was built during the 70's, its original features included a modular organisation, a street within the university and a landscaped environment. For some years now, it is a part of a developing area called Porte des [[Alpes]].

*1987 : University Lyon 2 was renamed University Lumière Lyon 2. The logo was created by the Art and Design School of Lyon reflecting the University's new ambitions: offering optimal access to the foundations of culture, promoting initiatives and opening itself to the world.

*Today : University Lumière Lyon 2 extends over two main sites :
- Berges du Rhône', the historic site in the centre of Lyon on the left bank of the Rhone, the head office of the University;
- Porte des Alpes', on the south-eastern outskirts of Lyon, in Bron and Saint-Priest which houses the teaching and research premises and the buildings of the polytechnic institute (IUT Lumière) as well as cultural and sports activities.
