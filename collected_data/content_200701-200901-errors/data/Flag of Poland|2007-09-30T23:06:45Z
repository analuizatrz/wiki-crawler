The '''[[national colors]] of [[Poland]]''' are [[white]] and [[red]]. If displayed horizontally, the white is on top, if vertically &ndash; on the left. The colors, which are of [[heraldry|heraldic]] origin and have a history dating back to [[1831]], are one of three constitutional symbols of the Republic of Poland, along with the coat of arms, the [[coat of arms of Poland|White Eagle]], and the national anthem, ''[[Mazurek Dąbrowskiego]]''. The '''Polish flag''' is a rectangular piece of cloth in the national colors, with or without the Polish coat of arms on the white stripe. Polish [[Flag Day]] is celebrated on May 2.

=== Legal sources ===
The colors and flags of the Republic of Poland are described in two legal documents: the [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland]] of 1997,<ref name=const>{{pl icon}} [http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/polski/kon1.htm ''Konstytucja Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej''] <nowiki>[</nowiki>{{en icon}} [http://bib.sejm.gov.pl/tek/txt/kpol/eng/kon1.html ''Constitution of the Republic of Poland'']<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Dz.U. 78.483.1997</ref> and the Coat of Arms, Colors and Anthem of the Republic of Poland, and State Seals Act (''Ustawa o godle, barwach i hymnie Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz o pieczęciach państwowych'') of 1980 with subsequent amendments<ref name=act>{{pl icon}} [http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/du/2005/2000.htm ''Ustawa o godle, barwach i hymnie Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz o pieczęciach państwowych''] <nowiki>[</nowiki>''Coat of Arms, Colors and Anthem of the Republic of Poland, and State Seals Act''<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Dz.U. 05.235.2000</ref> (henceforth referred to as "the Coat of Arms Act"). 

The legislation concerning the national symbols is far from perfect. The Coat of Arms Act has been amended a number of times and refers extensively to executive ordinances, some of which have never been issued. Moreover, the Act contains many errors, ommissions and inconsitencies which make the law confusing, open to various interpretations and often not followed in practice.<ref name=nik> {{pl icon}} Najwyższa Izba Kontroli, ''[http://bip.nik.gov.pl/pl/bip/wyniki_kontroli_wstep/inform2005/2005076/px_2005076.pdf Informacja o wynikach kontroli używania symboli państwowych przez organy administracji publicznej]'' <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[The Supreme Chamber of Control of Poland|Supreme Chamber of Control]], ''Information about the results of the control of state symbols usage by organs of public administration''<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Warsaw, April 2005</ref>

[[Image:Barwy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej.svg|left|thumb|Horizontal and vertical display of the colors of the Republic of Poland]]
=== National colors ===
According to Chapter I, Article 28, paragraph 2 of the Constitution:

{{quote|Colors of the Republic of Poland are white and red.<ref name=const />}}

Further specifications can be found in the Coat of Arms Act. According to Article 4 of the Act:

{{quote|Colors of the Republic of Poland are white and red in two horizontal, parallel stripes of equal width, of which the top one is white and the bottom one is red.<ref name=act />}}

The same article further specifies that if the colors are displayed vertically, the white stripe is placed on the left from the onlooker's viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal and vertical alignment, as well as coordinates of both colors in the [[Lab color space|CIE 1976]] color space.

=== Variants of the national flag ===
The Constitution constains no mention of a national flag. It is defined by the Coat of Arms Act which specifies two variants of the national flag: the '''national flag of the Republic of Poland''' (''flaga państwowa Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'') and the '''national flag with coat of arms of the Republic of Poland''' (''flaga państwowa z godłem Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej''). Both flags are defined in Article 6 of the act as follows:

[[Image:Polish flag construction sheet.PNG|right|thumb|An unofficial construction sheet of the flag with coat of arms, based on the specifications in Polish law]]

{{quote|
#The state flag of the Republic of Poland is a rectangular piece of cloth in the colors of the Republic of Poland hoisted on a flagpole.'' 
#The state flag of the Republic of Poland is also the flag specified in paragraph 1, with the coat of arms of the Republic of Poland placed in the middle of the white stripe.<ref name=act />}}

The fly to host ratio for both flags is 8:5. For the latter flag, the ratio between the [[inescutcheon]] of the cost of arms and the hoist is 2:5. Images of both variations of the flag can be found in attachment no. 3 to the Coat of Arms Act. 

Applying the rules of English heraldry and [[vexillology]], the above descriptions may be rendered into the following [[blazon]]s:

#''Per fess [[Argent]] and [[Gules]].''
#''Per fess Argent and Gules, in chief an inescutcheon of the Arms of Poland.''

== Usage ==
=== Respect for the flag ===
Polish law says that treating the national symbols, including the flag, "with reverence and respect" is the "right and obligation" of every Polish citizen and all state organs, institutions and organizations.<ref name=act /> Public disrespect, destruction or violent removal of the flag is considered a crime punishable by "a [[fine]], limitation of freedom <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Penal labour|penal servitude]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> or up to one year of deprivation of freedom <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[prison|imprisonment]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>".<ref name=penal>{{pl icon}} [http://isip.sejm.gov.pl/servlet/Search?todo=file&id=WDU19970880553&type=3&name=D19970553Lj.pdf ''Kodeks karny''] <nowiki>[</nowiki>''Penal code''<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Dz.U. 88.553.1997</ref> Official statistics show that crimes against national symbols are rare: 43 such crimes in 2003 and 96 in 2004 were less than 0.001% of all crimes registered in Poland in those years.<ref name=nik />

=== Who may and who is required to fly the flag ===
According to the Coat of Arms Act, 

{{quote|Everyone has the right to use the colors of the Republic of Poland, particularly in order to underline the significance of celebrations, holidays and other events}}

as long as it is done in a respectful manner.<ref name=act /> This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. Unauthorized use of national symbols was illegal and flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year.<ref name=nik /> This restriction and kind of state monopoly on the use of national symbols during the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Communist regime]] made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government. It became customary &ndash; and still is &ndash; for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on [[Strike action|strike]]. This is why the Polish flag, as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule, is part of the [[Solidarity]] trade union [[Solidarity logo|logo]].<ref>[[Małgorzata Niezabitowska]], ''Discovering America'', ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'', January 1988, p. 48</ref>

[[Image:Sejm RP.jpg|thumb|right|Polish flag flying atop the Sejm.]]

==== Flag without coat of arms ====
Organs that are required by law to fly the national flag without coat of arms on or in front of their official buildings are:
* the [[Sejm]] (lower house of parliament);
* the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] (upper house of parliament);
* the [[President of the Republic of Poland|President of the Republic]];
* the [[Council of Ministers of Poland|Council of Ministers]] (government) and the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|President of the Council of Ministers]] (Prime Minister);
* local legislatures &ndash; only during their sessions;
* other state and local government organs &ndash; only on national holidays.
Additionally, the national flag without coat of arms is used as an [[ensign]] for [[inland navigation]].<ref name=act />

==== Flag with coat of arms ====
While the ban on using the flag without coat of arms has been lifted, the use of the state flag with coat of arms is still legally restricted. This flag should be only flown:
* on or in front of Polish [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]], [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] and other representative offices and missions abroad, as well as by Polish ambassadors and consuls on their residences and vehicles;
* at civilian [[airport]]s and [[heliport]]s;
* on civilian [[airplane]]s &ndash; only during international flights;
* on buildings of [[seaport]] authorities;
* as a [[Civil ensign|merchant (civil) ensign]].<ref name=act />
In practice, however, this restriction is often ignored and the two flags &ndash; with and without coat of arms &ndash; are treated as interchangeable.<ref name=nik /> The variant with the coat of arms is particularly often used by the [[Polonia]], or Polish diaspora outside Poland, especially in the [[United States]].<ref name=prez>

=== Flag flying days ===
[[Image:Flag of Poland.jpg|thumb|left|A Polish flag fluttering in the wind]]

State and local government organs are legally required, and other institutions and organizations as well as all citizens are encouraged to fly the Polish flag on the following days:
* [[May 1]] &ndash; State Holiday ([[May Day]]);
* [[May 2]] &ndash; Polish [[Flag Day]];
* [[May 3]] &ndash; [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution]] Day;
* [[November 11]] &ndash; Independence Day.

'''Polish Flag Day''' (formally: Flag of the Republic of Poland Day, ''Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'') was first observed on May 2, 2004. It was established in order to educate the Polish people about the history and significance of national symbols. The choice of date was mostly due to practical reasons: since May 2 is already a day between two mandatory flag flying days, it allows for the flag to be flown continuously for three consecutive days. Polish diaspora outside Poland and the Polish Senate also observe [[Polonia]] Day on May 2, which was another reason why the Polish Flag Day has been established on that date. Unlike May Day and Constitution Day, it is not a [[Holiday#Public holidays|public holiday]], although making a bridge, i.e. taking a day off on that day is common practice (see [[Holidays in Poland]]).

[[Image:Benedykt 0041.jpg|right|thumb|Polish (white and red), papal (yellow and white) and Marian or municipal (white and blue) flags in [[Kraków]]'s [[Rynek Główny|Grand Square]] during [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s visit to Poland on [[May 27]] [[2006]].]]

Other days when the Polish flag is often flown on official buildings include:
* [[May 5]] and [[May 9]] &ndash; [[European symbols#Europe Day|Europe Days]] (together with the [[European flag]]);
* [[August 15]] &ndash; [[Polish Armed Forces]] Day (mostly on military premises and at [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|tombs of the Unknown Soldier]])
* [[September 27]] &ndash; [[Polish Secret State|Polish Underground State]] Day.

The flag is also popularly flown during imporant sporting events, such as the [[FIFA World Cup]], if Polish athletes are participating; and during an official visit of a particularly important person, especially a [[pope]], in Poland. During a pope's visit, the national flag is usually flown together with yellow and white [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] flags, and white and blue [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Marian]] flags. It is not common to fly the national flag on personal occasions, such as birthdays or weddings.

According to polls, about one out of three Poles say they own a Polish flag, and about one out of four fly it on national holidays. Such public display of patriotism is much more common in western Poland, especially in [[Greater Poland]], than in other parts of the country.<ref name=nik />

== Flag protocol ==
Apart from the obligation to treat the flag with due respect, Polish law does not offer a detailed flag protocol. Some orgazanization and public institutions, such as the Heraldic and Vexillological Institute<ref name=ihw>{{pl icon}} {{cite web
  | title = Protokół flagowy &ndash; Jak postępować z flagami
  | publisher = Instytut Heraldyczno-Weksylologiczny
  | date = [[11 July]] [[2005]]
  | url = http://www.pl.info.pl/IHW_WWW/index.php?act=view&ktg=32&idt=125
  | accessdate = 2007-09-30 }}</ref> 
and the [[Supreme Chamber of Control of the Republic of Poland|Supreme Chamber of Control]]<ref name=nik /> have proposed flag protocols for the Polish flag, based on custom, flag protocols of other countries such as [[Flag of India|India]] and the [[Flag of the United States|United States]], and common sense. These protocols, however, are not legally binding. 

=== Standards of respect ===
* The flag should never be dipped to any person or thing.<ref name=ihw />
* The flag should never have placed on it any mark, letter, word, number or drawing of any kind.<ref name=nik /><ref name=ihw />
* The flag should never touch the ground, floor or water beneath it.<ref name=nik /><ref name=ihw />
* The flag should be secured from being torn off or falling to the ground. It should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind.<ref name=nik /><ref name=ihw />
* The flag should never be dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, the flag should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors<ref name=nik /> and then, burning.<ref name=ihw />

=== Correct display ===
* A single specimen of the flag on or in front of a public office building serves a informative role &ndash; it indicates the building's official role. Multiple flags serve a decorative role and should only be used to mark special occasions, such as national holidays.<ref name=nik />
* The flag should be raised before 8 a.m. and lowered at sunset. If it is flown at night, it should be illuminated.<ref name=nik />
* During a ceremonial raising of the flag, the [[Mazurek Dąbrowskiego|national anthem]] is played. Timing of the raising should match the duration of the anthem.<ref name=ihw /> Civilians pay respect by standing in a dignified manner; additionally, men uncover they heads. Members of uniformed services stand at attention. If their uniform includes headgear, they also perform the [[two-finger salute]]. Standard-bearers dip their banners to the flag.<ref name=act />
* In [[Polish heraldry]], the [[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] (color) of the charge has priority in relation to the tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Ealge, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms.
* If the flag drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.<ref name=ihw />
* If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left side when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers.<ref name=ihw />

=== With other flags ===
[[Image:Polish, Lesser Poland and EU flags.jpg|thumb|right|Example of indoor display of the flag of Poland (center) togeher with other flags: that of the [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]] (left) and the [[European flag]] (right)]]
* When flown with other flags, each flag must be displayed from a separate pole of the same height.<ref name=nik />
* The Polish flag should be raised first and lowered last.<ref name=nik />
* The Polish flag should be always placed in the most honorable position.<ref name=nik />
** If the total number of flags is even, the Polish flag should be placed to its right of the other flags.<ref name=ihw />
** If the total numer of flags is odd, the Polish flag should be placed in the middle. Alternatively, two Polish flag may be placed, one at each end of the row of flags.<ref name=ihw />
* The order of precedence for flags is as follows:<ref name=ihw />
** flag of Poland,
** national flags of other countries (in alphabetical order),
** [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]] flags,
** [[powiat|county]] flags,
** [[gmina|commune]] flags,
** [[European flag]],
** flags of domestic oragnizations,
** flags of international organizations,
** public services flags,
** corporate flags,
** other flags.

=== National mourning ===
The President of the Republic may announce a period of [[National day of mourning|national mourning]]. During that time Polish flags are flown at [[half-staff]].<ref name=act /> If a flag is flown from a wooden pole rather than a staff or mast, a black ribbon is attached to the pole as a sign of mourning or a black flag is flown to its left from the national flag.<ref name=nik />

== History ==
=== Royal banner ===
[[Image:Great Chorąży of the Polish Crown.jpg|thumb|right|Stanisław Sobieski, Great Standard Bearer of the Polish Crown, carrying King [[Sigismund III of Poland|Sigismund III's]] double-swallow-tailed royal banner consisting of red and white stripes emblazoned with a coat of arms combining the heraldic symbols of [[Kingdom of Poland|Poland]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and the [[House of Vasa]] (ca. 1605)]] 
{{main|Banner of Poland}}
The earliest [[vexilloid]]s (flag-like objects) used in Poland were known as ''stanice'' and probably resembled the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[vexillum]]'', that is a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal crosspiece attached to a wooden pole or [[spear]]. They served as both religious and military symbols as early as 10th century CE. With Poland's conversion to Christianity in 966, the ''stanice'' were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones. The royal [[banner of arms]] dates back to the the reign of [[Boleslaus II of Poland|Boleslaus the Generous]] (1076-1079), but it was during the reign of King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Ladislaus the Elbow-High]] (1320–1333) that a red cloth emblazoned with the White Eagle of the arms of Poland was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of royal authority used at coronations and in battles.<ref name=znamier>{{pl icon}} {{cite book

In the times of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a banner of the Commonwealth was also used, combining the heraldic symbols of Poland and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with the [[Coat of arms of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|arms of the Commonwealth]] which combined the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania ([[Coat of arms of Lithuania|Pursuer]]). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white ([[Argent]]) [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] on a red ([[Gules]]) [[Field (heraldry)|field]], these two colors started to be used for the entire banner. During the 17th century, the banner was often divided into three or four horizontal, foten swallow-tailed, stripes of white and red.<ref name=znamier />

=== National cockade ===
[[Image:Grottger-pozegnanie fragm.jpg|thumb|left|A woman pinning a red-and-white [[cockade]] to a Polish insurgent's square-shaped ''[[rogatywka]]'' cap during the [[January Uprising]] of 1863-1864]]
In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used [[cockade]]s, or knots of colored ribbons pinned to the hat, to denote the nationality of their military. In Poland, until 1831, there was no consensus as to what the colors of the national cockade should be. Polish soldiers wore white, white-and-red, blue-and-red or blue-white-red cockades. 

The custom came to Poland from [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] during the reign of [[Augustus II of Poland|Augustus II]] (1697-1733), King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. During that time, the cockade worn by the Polish military had, like in Saxony, the form of a white silk ribbon with a knot in the middle. It was later replaced with a circular white cockade wrinkled toward the center, patterned after the cockade of the [[Kingdom of France]]. During the reign of [[Stanislaus II of Poland|Stanislaus Augustus]] (1764-1795), a white-and-red cockade came into use alongside the plain white one. In 1791, the Military Commission introduced a metal [[cross pattée]] as a more durable alternative to the cockade. However, many soldiers continued to either pin the cross to the cockade or wear the cockade without the cross. Polish military leaders and national heroes of the time, such as General [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] and Prince [[Józef Poniatowski]] pinned plain white "national" cockades to their hats.<ref name=znamier />

[[Image:Uchwała o kokardzie narodowej.jpg|thumb|right|National [[Cockade]] Act of [[7 February]] [[1831]]]]
The patriotic and staunchly [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] members of the [[Bar Confederation]] of 1768-1772 adopted [[crimson]] &ndash; the symbol of Polish ''[[szlachta]]'', or nobility &ndash; and blue &ndash; symbolizing [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] &ndash; as their colors. These, as well as white-and-red, were considered national colors during the [[Great Sejm]] of 1788-1792. White and red were first publicly used as national colors by civilians on [[3 May]] [[1792]] in [[Warsaw]], during a celebration of the first anniversary of the adoption of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution of 1791]]. Meanwhile, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] politicians wore the blue-white-red cockades of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legions]] created in 1791 in [[French client republic|French-controlled republics]] in [[Italy]], used either the French tricolor cockade or national cockades of the particular Italian republics in which they served. The military of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] (1807-1815) and the [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom of Poland]] (1815-1831) used the white cockade, which was also worn by the cadets who started the [[November Uprising]] against [[Russian Empire|Russian]] rule on [[29 November]] [[1830]].<ref name=znamier />

During the uprising, the Sejm realized the need for unified national insignia that could be used by the Polish military. On [[7 February]] [[1831]] it adopted white and red, the [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] (colors) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms, as the national cockade of Poland. The white-and-red cockade was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising, as well as by participants of the [[Kraków Uprising]] of 1846, Polish freedom fighters in the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] of 1848, and Polish insurgents during the [[January Uprising]] of 1863-1864. White and red colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule, as well as by people in other countries, such as France, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[German Confederation|Germany]] and [[Belgium]], as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause. The Sejm's decision was not, however, immediately accepted by all. Left-wing politicians of the time, such as [[Joachim Lelewel]], continued to regard the revolutionary blue, white and red as true national colors. Tricolor standards were used by some Polish guerilla units during the January Uprising.<ref name=znamier />

=== Twentieth century ===
[[Image:Opaska powstancza.jpg|thumb|left|A white-and-red [[brassard]] worn by a Polish insurgent during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of 1944. The acronym WP stands for ''Wojsko Polskie'', or [[Polish Armed Forces]].]]
White-and-red flags were first waved during a patriotic demonstration on [[3 May]] [[1916]] in Warsaw. The organizing committee advised participants about the correct alignment of the colors, that is with the white stripe above the red one. Still, many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on top. On [[1 August]] [[1919]], almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red bicolor as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red [[International maritime signal flags|maritime signal flag]] used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced a variant of the flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a [[civil ensign]] and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.<ref name=znamier />

Apart from changes in the legal specifications of the shades of the national colors (see the section below), the basic design of the Polish flag, including the 5:8 ratio, has remained unchanged to this day. The flag with coat of arms was only modified to adjust to the changes in the coat of arms itself. Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from [[Neoclassicism|Classicist]] to [[Baroque]] in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Communist rule]] from 1944 to 1990.

[[Image:Polish Flag Monte Cassino2.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish flag flying on the ruins of the [[Monte Cassino]] abbey on [[18 May]] [[1944]]]]
20th-century Polish insurgents wore white-and-red [[brassard]]s (armbands) which played a role similar to the cockade of the previous centuries. Such armbands were worn by Polish freedom fighters during the [[Greater Poland Uprising]] (1918-1919) and [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919-1921), as well as during the [[Second World War]] by the soldiers of the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] (AK) and [[Bataliony Chłopskie|Peasants' Battalions]] (BCh) &ndash; usually defaced with the acronyms of their formations.<ref name=znamier />

During the Second World War, Polish soldiers raised the Polish flag on several sites of their victories. On [[18 May]] [[1944]], after an Allied victory over the German forces in the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]], a patrol of the 12th Podolian Uhlan Regiment (part of the [[Polish 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division]]) raised a Polish flag on the ruins of the [[Monte Cassino]] abbey in Italy. On [[1 August]] [[1944]], the first day of the [[Warsaw Uprising]], a white-and-red flag was hoisted on the [[Prudential plc|Prudential]] building, Warsaw's tallest skyscraper of the time. During the liberation of Warsaw by Soviet forces and [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Polish People's Army]] on [[17 January]] [[1945]], Polish flags were raised on the [[Belweder|Belvedere]] palace and the ruins of the [[Warsaw Main Rail Station|Main Railway Station]]. On [[2 May]] [[1945]], after the [[Battle in Berlin|capture of Berlin]], soldiers of the 7th Battery, 3rd Division, 1st Light Artillery Regiment planted Polish flags on the [[Berlin Victory Column]].<ref name=znamier />

Polish flags were also used by anti-government demonstrators under the Communist rule. During the bloody riots of [[Poznań 1956 protests|1956 in Poznań]] and [[Polish 1970 protests|1970 in Gdańsk]], protesters carried flags that were blood-stained on the white stripe.<ref name=znamier />

Until 1927, the exact shades of the national colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended on what kind of red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland [[crimson]], due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested [[Polish cochineal]], although imported alternatives were also available: [[Kermes (dye)|kermes]] from the Mediterranean Basin (hence ''karmazyn'', the Polish name of the color) and Mexican [[cochineal]] after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that ''karmazyn'' became synonymous with a [[magnate]]. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the [[Nałęcz]] clan of [[Greater Poland]] were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King [[Premislaus II of Poland|Premislaus]] in 1296.<ref name=znamier /> In the first half of the 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]]. 

The National Cockade Act of 1831 did not specify the shade of red, for which it was criticized by Joachim Lelewel,<ref name=znamier /> nor did the Coat of Arms and National Colors Act of 1919. In 1921, the Ministry of Military Affairs issued a pamphlet with illustrations of the Polish flag and other national symbols which used the crimson shade of red.<ref>

The pamphlet was not, however, an official source of law and was published for informative purpose only. The shade of red was first legally specified by a presidential decree of [[13 December]] [[1928]] which stipulated that the official shade is [[vermillion]]. This specification was upheld by a decree of [[7 December]] [[1955]].<ref name=znamier /> The verbal prescription was replaced with coördinates in the [[Lab color space|CIE 1976 color space]] by the Coat of Arms Act of [[31 January]] [[1980]],<ref name=act /> bringing the resulting hue closer to crimson again.
