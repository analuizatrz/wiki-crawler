[[Image:Canada 2006 Federal Election seats.svg|thumb| The initial seat distribution of the 39th Canadian Parliament]]
[[Image:Harper,-Stephen-Jan-23-06.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen Harper]] is Prime Minister during the 39th Canadian Parliament.  He is seen here giving his victory speech after the 2006 federal election which ended thirteen years of Liberal rule.]]

The '''39th Canadian Parliament''' is the current [[Parliament of Canada]], and has been in session since [[April 3]], [[2006]].<ref name="key dates">{{Cite web|author=Government of Canada|publisher=Library of Parliament| title=Key Dates for each Parliament| work=ParlInfo| accessdate=2007-11-04| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/compilations/parliament/KeyDates.aspx}}</ref>  The membership was set by the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] on [[January 23]], [[2006]], and it has changed only somewhat due to resignations and [[by-elections]].<ref name="key dates"/>  The longest it could run, barring war or national emergency, is until [[October 19]], [[2009]] due to Bill C-16, passed by this Parliament.  Historically, however, [[minority government]]s in Canada such as the current one have rarely lasted more than two years.

It is controlled by a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] minority, led by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] and the [[28th Canadian Ministry]], which assumed power on [[February 6]], [[2006]].<ref name="prime minister">{{Cite web|author=Government of Canada|publisher=Library of Parliament| title=Prime Minister of Canada: Biographical Information| work=ParlInfo| accessdate=2007-11-04| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/FederalGovernment/PrimeMinisters/Biographical.aspx}}</ref>  The [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]], led first by interim leader [[Bill Graham]], and currently by [[Stéphane Dion]].<ref name="opposition leader">{{Cite web| author=Government of Canada| title=Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons| date=2006-02-24| accessdate=2006-11-30| publisher=Library of Parliament| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/house/OppLeaderCareer.asp?Language=E&Hist=Y}}</ref>

The [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons|Speaker]] is Liberal [[Peter Milliken]].  Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on [[April 3]], [[2006]]. The Speaker only votes in a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus is effectively reduced by one.<ref name="house speakers"/>  This, along with the defection of [[Wajid Khan]] to the Conservatives enables the Conservatives to pass legislation with the cooperation of any one of the three [[opposition parties]]: [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[Bloc Québécois]], or [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP).

There have been two [[Parliamentary session|sessions]] of the 39th Parliament<ref name="sessions">{{Cite web|author=Government of Canada|publisher=Library of Parliament| title=Parliaments - Duration of Sessions| work=ParlInfo| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/compilations/parliament/Sessions.aspx|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref>

The party standings as elected and as of [[November 24]], [[2007]], are on the table below.  Since the election, four members of the House of Commons [[crossed the floor]] (two of whom had previously been forced to sit as an independent), one died, eight resigned, and five members have been elected in by-elections to fill vacancies (four vacancies remain to be filled).  In that same period, two senators have died, six have resigned (four of whom had reached the mandatory retirement age), and one has been appointed to fill a vacancy (twelve vacancies remain).  Step-by-step changes are listed in the [[39th Canadian Parliament#Members|Members]] section.  See [[List of Canadian federal electoral districts]] for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

==Major events==
===Floor-crossing===
Four members of parliament have [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] since the election: 

On [[February 6]], [[2006]], [[David Emerson]], elected as the Liberal [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Vancouver Kingsway]], crossed the floor to join Stephen Harper's cabinet as Minister of International Trade.<ref>{{cite web

On [[February 6]], [[2007]], [[Garth Turner]], elected as a Conservative MP for [[Halton (electoral district)|Halton]], moved to the Liberal caucus.  He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Tory caucus on [[October 18]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web

On [[June 26]], [[2007]], [[Joe Comuzzi]], elected as a Liberal MP for [[Thunder Bay&mdash;Superior North]], moved to the Conservative caucus.  He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Liberal caucus on [[March 21]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news |authorlink=CTV News |author=CTV.ca News Staff |title=Harper makes it official: Comuzzi joins Tory fold |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070626/Joe_Comuzzi_07626/20070626?hub=Canada |publisher=CTV.ca |date=2007-06-26 |accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref>

On [[23 November]], [[2007]], Wajid Khan announced that he would withdraw from the Conservative caucus and sit as an Independent MP.

===Liberal leadership===
During the election campaign, the Liberal leader was then Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]].   After the election results were announced, Liberal leader [[Paul Martin]] announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into the next election. On [[February 1]], the Liberal Party Caucus chose [[Bill Graham (politician)|Bill Graham]] as [[parliamentary leader]], meaning he served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] until the election of [[Stéphane Dion]] as Liberal leader at the next Liberal Party leadership convention, held [[December 2]] through [[December 3]].

Some political observers had questioned whether Martin would have led the Liberals into an election had the Harper minority fallen in the first few months of the 39th Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jane |last=Taber |authorlink=Jane Taber |title=Martin hands caucus reins to Graham |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060202.LIBERALS02/TPStory/?query= |format=fee required |publisher=globeandmail.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2007-11-04 }}</ref>  In 1979,  [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s Liberals lost to [[Joe Clark]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] who only won a minority on [[May 22]] of that year. The Clark minority was defeated less than seven months after on a [[motion of no confidence|confidence vote]] over the budget, which was much earlier than most observers had expected the government to fall. Trudeau had announced his resignation as leader of the Liberals on [[November 21]], [[1979]]; however in light of the collapse of the government on [[December 13]], [[1979]], and the Liberal Party's not having chosen a replacement as leader, Trudeau was persuaded to change his mind, and he led the party into the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 election]] winning a [[majority government]]. Unlike Martin, Trudeau did not appoint an [[interim leader]] or withdraw from the day-to-day leadership of the party after announcing he would resign. 

On [[March 18]], [[2006]] Martin officially tendered his resignation as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-12-02 }}</ref> This move was widely seen as a move by Martin to stop any talk of him leading the party into the next election.

===Five priorities===
Prime Minister Harper has said he will move forward with his top five priorities from the campaign.  At least four of these will require legislative action: the passage of a ''[[Federal Accountability Act]]'' in response to the [[sponsorship scandal]]; combating crime by creating more police officers and setting longer [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentences]]; lowering the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods & Services Tax]] to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6.  On [[December 6]], [[2006]], another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling "on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages."  The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled.<ref>{{cite news |first=Gloria |last=Galloway |title=Same-sex marriage file closed for good, PM says |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061208.SAMESEX08/TPStory/?query=%22same-sex+marriage%22 |format=fee required |publisher=globeandmail.com |date=2006-08-12 |accessdate=2007-11-04 }}</ref> (See [[Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage]] for more information.)

===Resignations and By-elections===

On [[September 20]], [[2006]] Liberal MP [[Joe Fontana]] ([[London North Centre]]) resigned to run in the London mayoralty election. Fontana was replaced in the riding by Liberal [[Glen Pearson]] after a by-election on [[November 27]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web

Liberal MP [[Jean Lapierre]] declared on [[January 11]], [[2007]] that he would resign from the Liberal Party at the end of the month to pursue a career in television. This took place on [[January 28]], leaving the [[Outremont (federal electoral district)|Outremont]] district vacant. On [[July 28]], Prime Minister Stephen Harper called [[by-elections]] for this and two other Quebec ridings, which were held on [[September 17]], [[2007]]. Newcomer NDP candidate [[Thomas Mulcair]] won this riding over star Liberal candidate Jocelyn Coulon, only the second-ever time Outremont has not been won by a Liberal candidate. Mulcair was previously a Provincial Liberal Cabinet Minister in Quebec.<ref>{{cite web| title =Federal NDP recruits former Quebec Liberal minister| publisher =  CBC 2007| date =Tuesday, September 18, 2007| url =http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2007/04/20/mulcair-ndp.html| accessdate = 2007-12-02 }}</ref>

On [[21 February]] [[2007]], [[Yvan Loubier]] (representing [[Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot]] for the [[Bloc Québécois]]) resigned in order to run in the [[Quebec general election, 2007]]. Loubier was replaced in a by-election on September 17, 2007, by newcomer Bloc candidate [[Ève-Mary Thaï Thi Lac]].<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Bill Graham Chile 2003.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Graham]] acted as interim leader of the official opposition until the Liberal leadership convention, after which he resigned his seat.]]
One day later, on [[February 22]], veteran Liberal MP and former [[Liberal Party of Canada]] interim leader [[Bill Graham]] announced that he would not seek reelection in the [[40th Canadian federal election|next federal election]]. On [[June 19]] [[2007]], Graham announced he would be resigning his [[Toronto Centre]] seat effective [[July 2]], [[2007]], to allow former [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] Premier and Liberal Party leadership candidate [[Bob Rae]] to run in the riding.<ref>{{cite web

On March 8, 2007, Liberal MP [[Jim Peterson]] announced that he would not be a candidate in the next federal election. Former Liberal Party leadership candidate [[Martha Hall Findlay]] was appointed as the Liberal candidate in his [[Willowdale (electoral district)|Willowdale]] riding.  On [[June 20]], [[2007]], Peterson followed Bill Graham's lead and announced his resignation from the House of Commons, effective [[July 12]]. Both Bill Graham and Jim Peterson resigned their seats early in the hope that Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] would be compelled to add those vacant seats to the scheduled September 17, 2007 by-elections in [[Quebec]].<ref>{{Cite news |author=Toronto Star |title=Peterson quits early in hopes of forcing byelection |publisher=thestar.ca |date= June 20, 2007 |accessdate=2006-07-06 |url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/227587}}</ref> On July 23, the Tory government announced that it would delay the Ontario by-elections so as not to overlap with the impending [[Ontario general election, 2007]] scheduled for [[October 10]], [[2007]].<ref>{{Cite news |author=The Globe and Mail |title=Tories to delay by-elections |publisher=globeandmail.com |date= July 23, 2007 |accessdate=2006-07-27 |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070723.BYELXN23/TPStory/TPNational/Ontario/}}</ref>

Also in March 2007, Bloc Québécois MP and former BQ House Leader [[Michel Gauthier]] announced that he would not run in the next federal election. He resigned his seat of [[Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean]] on [[July 29]], [[2007]].

On [[July 11]], [[2007]], Liberal MP [[Gary Merasty]] announced he would resign his [[Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River]] seat, due to "family considerations", effective [[August 31]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=Gary Merasty Steps Down as Member of Parliament for Desnethé-Missinippi-Churchill |publisher=Liberal Party of Canada |date=2007-07-11 |url=http://www.liberal.ca/story_12970_e.aspx |accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref>

==Major bills and motions==
Important business of the 39th Parliament includes the following [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] and [[Motion (democracy)|motions]].  Note that not all of these bills have yet become law.  Motions (excepting those which pass bills) have no effect in law.  A complete list of bills of the 39th Parliament is on the Parliament's website, divided into bills from the [http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&Session=14 1st] and [http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&Session=15 2nd] sessions.  On the site, the bills are divided into government bills, [[private member's bill]]s, and [[private bill]]s for both the House and the Senate.

===Acts passed by 39th Parliament===
=====Federal Accountability Act=====
Bill C-2, the [[Federal Accountability Act]] (officially ''"An Act providing for conflict of interest rules, restrictions on election financing and measures respecting administrative transparency, oversight and accountability"''), received [[royal assent]] in the Senate on [[December 12]], [[2006]], and is now becoming law.  The act plans to reduce the opportunity to exert influence with money by banning corporate, union, and large personal political donations; create a five-year lobbying ban on former ministers, their aides, and senior public servants; provide protection for whistleblowers; and enhancing the power for the Auditor General to follow the money spent by the government.

=====Extending the Afghan War until 2009=====
[[Image:Canadian soldiers afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian soldiers in [[Afghanistan]].]]
A motion in the House to extend Canada's [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|mission in Afghanistan]] by two years was successful.  Canada's presence in [[Afghanistan]] will now last until early 2009.

After several months of debates, and consideration of the subject-matter by a special committee, the bill was read a second time on [[February 20]], [[2007]].  At the same time, it was referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration.  It was then delayed so that the Supreme Court of Canada could rule with respect to its constitutionality.  It had been suggested that the Liberal Senate would modify the bill to extend the terms to twelve years so that a prime minister would not control the entire Senate after two parliaments.  The bill did not pass by the end of the 1st session of parliament.
