A '''mermaid''' (from the [[Middle English]] ''mere'' in the obsolete sense 'sea'(as in ''[[maritime]]'',the Latin [[mare]], "sea") + ''maid(en)'') is a [[legendary creature|legendary]] aquatic creature with the head and torso of human female and the tail of a fish. The male version of a mermaid is called a [[merman]]; the gender-neutral plural is ''merfolk''. Various cultures throughout the world have similar figures.  Much like [[Sirens]], mermaids in stories would sometimes sing to sailors and enchant them, distracting them from their work and causing them to walk off the deck or cause shipwrecks. Other stories would have them squeeze the life out of drowning men while trying to rescue them. They are also said to take them down to their underwater kingdoms. In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' it is said that they forget that humans cannot breathe underwater, while others say they drown men out of spite.[[Image:Waterhouse_a_mermaid.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A Mermaid'' by [[John William Waterhouse]].]] 

The [[Siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]] are sometimes portrayed in later [[folklore]] as mermaid-like; in fact, some languages use the same word for both creatures. Other related types of [[mythology|mythical]] or [[legend]]ary creature are [[water fairies]] (e.g. various [[Nymph|water nymphs]]) and [[selkie]]s, animals that can change from one block into another type of any form of creature.

==Legend and myth==
[[Image:John Collier - The Land Baby.jpg|300px|thumb|left|''The Land Baby'', by [[John Collier (artist)| John Collier]](1899)]]
Legends of these half-human, half-fish humanoids have circulated for millennia, even as far back as 5,000 B.C.[http://www.americanmonsters.com/monsters/aquatic/index.php?detail=article&idarticle=24] 
It has been widely suggested or implied that [[manatee]]s or [[dugong]]s could be behind the myth of the mermaid. An example supporting this theory would be that [[Christopher Columbus]] had logged that he had seen mermaids on his journey to the new world, but thought they would be more attractive. These large aquatic [[mammal]]s are notable for the way in which they carry their young, cradled in their arms much as a human would carry a baby. It is possible that sailors seeing these unfamiliar beasts for the first time, would assume that they had in fact stumbled across some sort of [[humanoid]] species, and consequently spread their accounts of the sightings through their homelands on their return from voyages. It has even been posited that the traditional image of a mermaid with long flowing hair could be attributed to manatees breaking the ocean surface underneath patches of [[seaweed]], and giving the unfamiliar observer the impression of having long hair. Sightings from first-hand witnesses generally describe mermaids who do not talk at all, who have green, black, brown, and blonde hair and who have a bottom half of a fish, they are also said to be sighted when Scuba Diving, rarely seen in rivers.[http://www.newanimal.org/merfolk.htm]

=== Ancient Near East ===

Tales of mermaids are nearly universal. The first known mermaid [[folklore|stories]] appeared in [[Assyria]], ca. [[1000s BCE|1000 BCE]]. [[Atargatis]], the mother of Assyrian queen [[Semiramis]], was a goddess who loved a mortal shepherd and in the process killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake to take the form of a fish, but the waters would not conceal her divine nature. Thereafter, she took the form of a mermaid &mdash; human above the waist, fish below &mdash; though the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as being a fish with a human head and legs, similar to the [[Babylonia]]n [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]]. The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo, where she was often [[wiktionary:conflate|conflated]] with [[Aphrodite]].

Prior to 546 BCE, the Milesian philosopher [[Anaximander]] proposed that mankind had sprung from an aquatic species of animal. He thought that man with his extended [[infancy]] could not have survived, originally, in the manner he does presently. This idea does not appear to have survived Anaximander's death.

A popular Greek legend has [[Alexander the Great]]'s sister, [[Thessalonice of Macedon|Thessalonike]], turn into a mermaid after her death.<ref> {{PDFlink|[http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf Teacher's Guide]|246&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 252547 bytes -->}}</ref> She lived, it was said, in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and when sailors would encounter her, she would ask them only one question: ''"Is Alexander the king alive?"'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Ζει ο βασιλιάς Αλέξανδρος;''), to which the correct answer would be ''"He lives and still rules"'' (Greek: ''Ζει και βασιλεύει''). Any other answer would spur her into a rage, where she transformed into a [[Gorgon]] and meant doom for the ship and every sailor onboard.

[[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] in [[Syria]] (2nd century CE) in ''De Dea Syria'' ("Concerning the Syrian Goddess") wrote of the Syrian temples he had visited:
:"Among them - Now that is the traditional story among them concerning the temple. But other men swear that Semiramis of [[Babylonia]], whose deeds are many in Asia, also founded this site, and not for Hera [[Atargatis]] but for her own Mother, whose name was [[Atargatis|Derketo]]"
:"I saw the likeness of Derketo in [[Phoenicia]], a strange marvel. It is woman for half its length, but the other half, from thighs to feet, stretched out in a fish's tail. But the image in [[Jerusalem|the Holy City]] is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fishes to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls, they do not eat the dove, for she is holy so they believe. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and [[Semiramis]], the first because Derketo has the shape of a fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a [[dove]]. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the [[Egyptians]], some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo."<ref>Lucian of Samosata, ''De Dea Syria'' Part 2, Chapter 14</ref>

===Arabian Nights===

The [[Arabian Nights]] include several tales featuring "Sea People". Unlike the depiction in other mythologies, these are anatomically identical to land-bound humans, differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater. They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, the children of such unions inheriting the ability to live underwater. See [http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Dixon/dixon01_01.htm The King of Persia and the Princess of The Sea].)

ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>

Mermaids could also swim up rivers to freshwater lakes.  One day, in a lake near his house, the Laird of Lorntie saw, as he thought, a woman drowning, and went to aid her; a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed after that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.<ref>K.

One freshwater mermaid-like creature from European folklore is [[Melusine]], who is sometimes depicted with two fish tails, and other times with the lower body of a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]].  It is said in [[Japan]] that eating the flesh of a mermaid can grant unaging [[immortality]]. In some [[European]] legends mermaids are said to grant wishes.

Also, some people claim they have seen dead or living mermaids in places like [[Scotland]], [[Malaysia]] and [[British Columbia]]. Two most recent Canadian sightings took place in the [[Straight of Georgia]]. [http://www.tourismvictoria.com/Content/EN/747.asp], 
[http://www.folklore.bc.ca/Folkexamples.htm]

It is rumored amongst some of the "Cape Coloured" communities of South Africa that mermaids are found in the Little Karoo. Some older Cape Coloureds claim to have seen mermaids in fresh water pools during their childhood. Whilst the Little Karoo is a very dry area, pre-hisotically it formed a part of an ocean which is substantiated by evidence such as fossiled shells in the area. The story of mermaids has been orally passed down through an unknown number of generations. It is thought that some local bushman rock art depicted at approximately 11 rock art sites around the Little Karoo illustrates the existence of mermaids. Other explanations are that the rock paintings illustrate a bird called a swallow with the figure of a human head. This illustration represents the outer body experience of spiritual men during spiritual ceremonies undertaken to conjure up rain. Since the Cape Coloured community stems from a mixture of white settlers and local indigenous tribes such as the Khoi and San, it is thought that the story of mermaids was brought with the white settlers and misinterpreted is this rock art.

===Literature===

Mermaids are one of the most famous creatures of [[popular culture]], and are depicted regularly in literature and film. This is likely due to the influence of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairytale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ([[1836]]), which has been translated into many languages.  Andersen's portrayal, immortalized with a famous bronze sculpture in [[Copenhagen]] harbour, has arguably become the standard and has influenced most modern Western depictions of mermaids since it was published.  The story has been retold in other films and television programs, and regularly features in collections of fairytales.  It has been adapted into various media, the most famous of which is the [[1989]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|movie of the same name]].

[[L. Frank Baum]] (creator of [[Land of Oz|Oz]]) wrote a novel about merfolk, ''[[The Sea Fairies]]''.  Later, in ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'', the same characters are rescued from danger by the mermaids.

[[T.S. Eliot]], in "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]", uses the metaphor of mermaids to emphasis Prufock's plight:
<blockquote>
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. <br>
I do not think that they will sing to me. 
</blockquote>

Mermaids appear in the [[Peter Pan]] novel and in adaptations of it (such as the film ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'') and the [[Harry Potter]] series, specifically in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.

Many mermaids appear in works of fantasy fiction, including [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Merman's Children''.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Mermaids" p 639 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

One of the stories embedded in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s [[The Goblin Tower]], as being told by the book's story-telling protagonist Jorian, is about a human king who fell in love with a mermaid. The story tells with hilarious detail of the couple's difficult efforts to physically consummate their love, which nearly ends in disaster (he nearly drowns in trying to have sex underwater, and she is nearly killed by his bodyguards in revenge). In the end, the king marries a human woman, though keeping a platonic friendship with the mermaid. 

In the [[comic book]] series, ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', in issue #4 (July 1959), the 4-page story "I Love a Mermaid!" presented a sailor falling in love with a mermaid named Alethea. By story's end, the sailor turned out to be a lost merman who found his true home with Alethea at his side. 

The [[comic book]] [[superhero]] ''[[Superman]]'' had a romantic love interest with a mermaid named [[Lori Lemaris]]. The name Lori Lemaris was probably drawn from [[Lorelei]] rock in the [[Rhine]] added to ''maris'', from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning ocean. One may also note that she has the initials L.L. the same as several of Superman's other love interests like [[Lois Lane]] and [[Lana Lang]]

In the fourth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry encounters a community of Merfolk living beneath the surface of the Hogwarts grounds lake.  The lake would appear to be a saltwater lake, since a Giant Squid lives in it as well.  In this novel, Merfolk are regarded as being comprised of both male and female individuals.  They are portrayed as having green hair and skin, and yellow, mossy teeth.  The Merfolk observe his attempt at the second Task, which is to rescue the thing he holds most dear from the merfolk.  That 'thing' is, in fact, his best friend Ron Weasely.  When it becomes clear that one of the other Champions is not going to come to rescue her similarly bound younger sister, he takes her as well and brings them to the surface of the lake.  While the Merfolk are portrayed as being rather wild and menacing, they are ultimately accommodating and fair, telling Professor Dumbledore of Harry's bravery in their lake.  Similar to other humanoid magical creatures in the Harry Potter universe, they do not wield or understand magic themselves.  

''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]'', a novel by [[Alice Hoffman]], is about two 13 year old girls who discover a sassy teenage mermaid.  The novel was popular among teen and preteen girls.  The novel was made in to a film released in [[2006]] by Twentieth Century Fox and starred [[Sara Paxton]], [[Emma Roberts]] and [[JoJo]].

In the book "The Tail of Emily Windsnap", Emily takes a swimming class and discovers her tail. She goes out looking for her dad and convinces King Neptune that humans and merfolk can live together. 

As with many other mythological creatures, mermaids appear in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' games (see [[Merfolk (Dungeons & Dragons)]]).

[[J.K. Rowling]] wrote a special book for Comic Relief entitled "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" which contains information on magical creatures in the Harry Potter world including mermaids. They are described as having three different species such as [[Sirens]], [[Selkies]] and [[Merrow]]s. The [[Selkies]] are the ones that appear in the fourth book.

In ''Talk Dirty To Me Part III'', the mermaid was played by the then-underaged [[Traci Lords]].  This version of the film was pulled from shelves once Lords' true age became public and replaced with an edited version, which subbed in scenes reshot with [[Lisa DeLeeuw]] in the mermaid role.  The edited version is called ''The New Talk Dirty To Me Part III'' and is the only version of the movie currently available.  

* In ''Talk Dirty To Me IV'', [[Taija Rae]] played a mermaid in a costume that was far inferior to those of the previous film.  In ''TDTM III'', the mermaid costumes were fair representations of mermaid's tails; they were skintight and reached as high as the actresses' waists.  Rae's mermaid costume in ''TDTM IV'' was quite bulky, covered her breasts, and appeared to be fashioned from leaves, plastic daisies, and foam rubber scales.

=== Music ===
Mermaids have long been associated with [[music]], and much like that of [[Orpheus]], the power of their singing voices had the ability to enthrall.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}
Along with their legendary vanity, the hair-combing and mirrors, the association of mermaids with music is coupled with another association of a vocal nature: they are said to be able to confer verbal eloquence, much like the Muses of the ancient [[Greek myths]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

===Hoaxes===
In the [[19th century]], [[P. T. Barnum]] displayed in his museum a [[taxidermy|taxidermal]] hoax called the ''[[Fiji mermaid|Feejee [''sic''] Mermaid]].'' Others have perpetrated similar hoaxes, which are usually [[papier-mâché]] fabrications or parts of deceased creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together for the appearance of a grotesque mermaid. In the wake of the [[2004 tsunami]], pictures of Fiji "mermaids" were passed around on the internet as something that had washed up amid the devastation, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.<ref>http://www.snopes.com/photos/tsunami/mermaid.asp</ref>

===Other===
In the [[Submarine Voyage]] ride at [[Disneyland]], from 1959 until the ride's closure in 1998, female cast members clad in modest bikini tops and mermaid tails would sunbathe on a rock. They brushed their hair for long periods of time, waved at guests, and so on.

==Artwork==
Perhaps one of the most famous mermaid paintings in the world was created by [[John William Waterhouse]], painted from 1895 to 1905, entitled ''A Mermaid'', (see the top of this article). An example of late British Academy style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place as a member of the [[Royal Academy]]), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s. It is currently in the collection of [[Lord Lloyd-Webber|Andrew Lloyd Weber]].

===Heraldry===
[[Image:POL Warszawa COA 1.svg|thumb|right|100px|Coat of arms of Warsaw]]
In [[heraldry]], the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror, and blazoned as a 'mermaid in her vanity.' Merfolk were used to symbolize eloquence in speech.

A shield and sword-wielding mermaid (''[[Siren|Syrenka]]'') is on the official [[Coat of arms of Warsaw]], the capital of [[Poland]].  The city of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] also uses a mermaid as a symbol, and a civic art project with variously decorated mermaid sculptures has been displayed all over the municipal area.

The personal coat of arms of [[Michaëlle Jean]], Canada's [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], features two [[Simbi]], mermaid-like spirits from [[Haiti]]an [[vodun]], as [[supporters]].

The [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee]] [[logo]] is not a mermaid, but a [[mixoparthenos]], a creature with a maiden's torso ending in two snake tails.

==Sirenomelia==
[[Sirenomelia]], also called "mermaid syndrome", is a rare [[congenital]] [[disease|disorder]] in which a child is born with his or her legs fused together and the [[Sex organ|genitalia]] reduced. This condition is about as rare as [[conjoined twins]] and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of [[kidney]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] complications. Two survivors are known to be alive today, after receiving operations to separate their legs.

==Symbolism==
According to [[Dorothy Dinnerstein]]’s book, ''The Mermaid and the Minotaur'', human-animal hybrids such as the minotaur and the mermaid convey the emergent understanding of the ancients that human beings were both one with and different from animals and that, as such, humans' "nature is internally inconsistent, that our continuities with, and our differences from, the earth's other animals are mysterious and profound; and in these continuities, and these differences, lie both a sense of strangeness on earth and the possible key to a way of feeling at home here".<ref name=Dinnerstein>
