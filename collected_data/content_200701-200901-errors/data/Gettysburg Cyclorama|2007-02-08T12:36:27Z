The '''Gettysburg National Military Park Cyclorama Center''' in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], is the home of the "[[Battle of Gettysburg]]" [[Cyclorama]], a 360 degree circular oil-on-canvas painting that depicts "[[Pickett's Charge]]," the climactic [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attack on the [[Union Army|Union]] center on [[July 3]], [[1863]]. Completed and exhibited in 1884, it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States.

The culmination of the battle was captured on canvas by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux, a professional cyclorama painter and artist. Philippoteaux was not present at Gettysburg, but came to the United States in 1879 when he was hired by a group of entrepreneurs to paint this monumental work. Philippoteaux came to Gettysburg in 1882 armed with a sketchbook, pencils, pens, and a simple guide book to help him locate the site of the climactic charge. The artist spent several weeks on the battlefield, observing details of the terrain and making hundreds of sketches. Philippoteaux was also lucky enough to interview a number of veterans of the battle, who helped with suggestions on how to depict the chaos of battle. Philippoteaux included himself in the painting, wearing the uniform of a Union [[colonel]].

The phenomenal work took over a year and one-half to complete. The "Cyclorama of the Battle of Gettysburg" opened to the public in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in 1884, complete with a three-dimensional earthen foreground littered with the relics of battle, stone walls, shattered trees, and broken fences. It proved so popular that Philippoteaux painted three other Pickett's Charge cycloramas, all similar in overall design to the original. A second one was painted in 1888 and placed on display in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] for several decades before being moved to Gettysburg in 1912. The cyclorama opened for public exhibition just in time for the 1913 Anniversary celebration of the Battle of Gettysburg in a specially constructed building on Baltimore Street, where it remained for approximately forty years. Purchased by the National Park Service in the late 1940s, the cyclorama in the early 1960s underwent a massive restoration project that required hours of hand labor to repair water damaged portions of the painting and two large sections faded by years of direct sunlight. The project was completed in time for the dedication the painting new home, the new park visitor center later that year (now the Cyclorama Center, designed by architect [[Richard Neutra]]). The cyclorama is 359 feet long, 27 feet high, and weighs an estimated 3 tons.

The original Gettysburg cyclorama is held at [[Wake Forest University]] after being donated to the school by its previous owner. It needs major repairs and is not on public display. The other two copies have not survived. One, originally displayed in [[Denver, Colorado]], was cut up and the canvas given to [[Shoshone]] Indians for use as tent coverings shortly after the turn of 20th Century. The fate of the other painting is unknown.

The Gettysburg Cyclorama closed in November 2005 to under go a projected nine million dollar rehabilitation project that began in 2003. Conservation specialists will repair unstable sections of the canvas and restore original details lost in the numerous repair and preservation attempts. Eventually it will be hung in its own unique viewing auditorium with a restored skyline and foreground, in the new National Park Service Visitor Center and Museum at [[Gettysburg National Military Park]], scheduled to open in late 2007.
