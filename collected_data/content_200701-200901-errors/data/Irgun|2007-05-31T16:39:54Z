'''Irgun''' ({{lang-he|ארגון}}), shorthand for '''Ha'Irgun Ha'Tsvai Ha'Leumi B'Eretz Yisrael''' ({{lang|he|הארגון הצבאי הלאומי בארץ ישראל}}, also spelled '''Ha'Irgun Ha'Zvai Ha'Leumi'''), Hebrew for "National Military Organization in the Land of Israel", was a clandestine militant [[Zionism|Zionist]] group that operated in [[Palestine (mandate)|Palestine]] from 1931 to 1948.  In Israel, this group is commonly referred to as '''Etzel''' ({{lang|he|אצ"ל}}), an acronym of the Hebrew initials. For secrecy reasons, in the time in which the Irgun operated, often people referred to the Irgun as (Haganah Bet) {{lang|he|הגנה ב}}, (Haganah Ha'leumit) {{lang|he|ההגנה הלאומית}} or {{lang|he|המעמד}} (Ha'ma'amad). Based on the premises formulated by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] that "every [[Jew]] had the right to enter [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]]; only active retaliation would deter the [[Arab]]s and the [[United Kingdom|British]]; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state", <ref>Howard Sachar: ''A History of the State of Israel'', pps 265-266</ref> the group made retaliation against Arab attacks a central part of their initial efforts as the armed expression of the nascent ideology of [[Revisionist Zionism]], it was a political predecessor movement to Israel's [[right-wing]] ''[[Herut]]'' (or "Freedom") party, which led to today's [[Likud]] party.

==Nature of the Movement==
[[Image:Zeev Jabotinsky.jpg|thumb|Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Formulated the movement's ideology and ''Supreme Leader'' of the Irgun]]
Members of the Irgun came mostly from [[Betar|Beitar]] and from the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Party]] both in Palestine and abroad. The Revisionist Movement made up a popular backing for the underground organization. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], founder of Revisionist Zionism, was the commander of the organization until he died. He formulated the general realm of operation, regarding ''[[Havlagah|Restraint]]'' and the end thereof, and was the inspiration for the organization overall. An additional major source of idealogical inspiration was the poetry of [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]]. The symbol of the organization, with the motto רק כך (Only Thus), alongside a hand holding a rifle in the foreground of all of mandatory Palestine (both sides of the [[Jordan River]]), symbolized the striving for Hebrew independence over the entire land of Israel, to be achieved only by the power of Hebrew weapons.

The number of members of the Irgun varied from a few hundred to a few thousand. Most of its members were people who accepted the organization's command, under which they carried out various operations and filled positions, largely in contrast to British law. Most of them were "ordinary" people, who held regular jobs, and only a few dozens worked full time in the Irgun.

The Irgun disagreed with the policy of the [[Yishuv]] and with the [[World Zionist Organization]], both with regards to strategy, basic ideology and with regards to PR and military tactics, such as use of force for Zionist ends, attitude towards the Arabs during the riots and relations with the British mandatory government. Therefore the Irgun tended to ignore the decisions made by the Zionist leadership and the Yishuv's institutions. This fact caused the elected bodies not to recognize the independent organization, and during most of the time of its existence the organization was seen as irresponsible, and its actions thus worthy of thwarting. Therefore the Irgun accompanied its armed operations with public relations campaigns, in order to convince the public of the Irgun's way and the problems with the official political leadership of the Yishuv. The Irgun put out numerous advertisement, an underground newspaper and even ran the first independent Hebrew radion station - [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]].

===Structure, command, insignia===
As an underground organization, members did not normally call it by its name, rather used other names. In the first years of its existence it was known primarily as "ההגנה הלאומית" (the National Haganah), and also by names such as "Irgun Bet", "Haganah Bet", the "Parallel Organization" and the "Rightwing Organization". Later on it was most widely known as "המעמד" (the Stand). The anthem adopted by the Irgun was "Anonymous Soldiers",<ref>http://www.betar.org.il/music/songs/hayalim.htm {{he icon}}, http://www.betar.org.il/music/songs/musicfiles/Khaialim_Almonim.mp3</ref> written by [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] who was at the time a commander in the Irgun. Later on Stern defected from the Irgun and founded [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], and the song became the anthem of the Lehi. The Irgun's new anthem then became  the third verse of the "Beitar Song", by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.

In August 1933 a "Supervisory Committee" for the Irgun was established, which included representatives from most of the Zionist political parties. The members of this committee were Meir Grossman (of the Hebrew State Party), [[Meir Bar-Ilan|Rabbi Meir Bar Ilan]] (of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Party]], either Immanuel Neumann or Yehoshua Supersky (of the [[General Zionists]]) and [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] or Eliyahu Ben Horin (of [[Hatzohar]]). The committee was in charge of the Irgun until 1937, when the movement split yet again. From that point on, the Irgun was under Jabotinsky's command. After his death ties were formed between the Irgun and the [[New Zionist Organization]]. These ties were broken in 1944 when the Irgun declared war on the British government.

Within the Irgun, [[Avraham Tehomi]] was the first to serve as "Head of the Headquarters" or "Chief Commander". Alongside Tehomi served the "Headquarters". When the movement expanded, districts were laid out within the movement. A local Irgun unit was called a "Branch". A "Brigade" in the Irgun was made up of three sections. A section was made up of two groups, at the head of each was a "Group Head", and a deputy. Later on various newer units were established, who answered to a "Center" or 
"Staff"). Ranks were put into use later on and were (in ascending order) Deputy, Group Head, Sergeant (for a Section), Sergeant A (Brigade), First Sergeant (Battalion); officer ranks were "Gundar" (District of Unit Commander) and First Gundar (Senior Commander). A rank of Major was awarded to the Irgun commander [[Yaakov Meridor]] and a rank of Major General ([[Aluf]]) to [[David Raziel]]. Until his death in 1940, Jabotinsky was known as the "Military Commander of the Etzel" or the "Supreme Commander".

The military nature of the organization manifested itself in two ways. First, was the execution of strict drill exercises, carrying out of ceremonies at different times, and strict attention given to discipline, formal ceremonies and military relationships between the various ranks. Another way the military nature was apparent was the organized training regime. The Irgun trained with handguns and submachine guns, hand grenade throwing, and combined attacks on targets. The Irgun put out professional publications on combat doctrine, weaponry, leadership, drill exercises, etc. Among these publications were the 240 page book "The Gun" by David Raziel and Avraham (Yair) Stern, and the 284 page book "The Compiled and Expanded Guide to Drill Exercises" by David Raziel. Up until the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab Revolt of 1936-1939]] the Haganah also made use of these guidebooks (afterwards the Haganah published its own military literature).

Until [[World War II]] the Irgun was able to arm itself by weapons purchased in Europe, primarily Italy and Poland, and smuggled to Palestine. The Irgun also established workshops that manufactured spare parts and attachments for the weapons. Also manufactured were land mines and simple hand grenades. Another way in which the Irgun armed itself was "Confiscations" - smuggling stolen weapons from the British police and military.

== Founding, development and key events ==
===Founding===
The Irgun's first steps were in the aftermath of the [[1929 Palestine riots|Riots of 1929]]. In the [[Jerusalem]] branch of the [[Haganah]] there were feelings of disappointment and internal unrest towards the leadership of the movements and the [[Histadrut]] (at that time the organization running the Haganah). These feelings were a result of the view that the Haganah had failed after ten years of existence in the face of murders, violence, property vandalism and Jewish abandonment of settlements and neighborhoods in light of outlaws' violence and local Arab gangs towards Jews. Likewise, critics of the leadership spoke out against alleged failures in the amount of weapons, readiness of the movement and its policy of restraint and not fighting back. On April 10, 1931, commanders and equipment managers announced that they refuse to return weapons to the Haganah that had been issued to them earlier, prior to the Nebi Musa holiday. These weapons were later returned by the commander of the Jerusalem branch, Abraham Tehomi, aka "Gideon". However, the commanders who decided to rebel against the leadership of the Haganah relayed a message regarding their resignations to the [[Vaad Leumi]], and thus this schism created a new independent movement.

At the helm of the new underground movement stood Abraham Tehomi, alongside other founding members who were all senior commanders in the Haganah, members of the Young Labor Party and of the Histadrut. Also among them was Eliyahu Ben Horin, an activist in the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Party]]. This group was known as the "Odessan Gang", because they previously had been members of the ''Haganah Ha'Atzmit'' of Jewish Odessa. The new movement was named ''Irgun Tsvai Leumi'', ("National Military Organization") in order to emphasize its active nature in contrast to the Haganah. Moreover, the organization was founded with the desire to become a true military organization and not just a militia as the Haganah was at the time.

In the autumn of that year the Jerusalem group merged with other armed groups affiliated with [[Betar|Beitar]]. The Beitar groups' center of activity was in [[Tel Aviv]], and they began their activity in 1928 with the establishment of "Officers and Instructors School of Beitar". Students at this institutions had broken away from the Haganah earlier, for political reasons, and the new group called itself the "National Defense", הגנה הלאומית. During the riots of 1929 Beitar youth participated in the defense of Tel Aviv neighborhoods under the command of Yermiyahu Halperin, at the behest of the Tel Aviv city hall. After the riots the Tel Avivian group expanded, and was known as "The Right Wing Organization".

After the Tel Aviv expansion another branch was established in [[Haifa]]. Towards the end of 1932 the Haganah branch of Safed also defected and joined the Irgun. Additionally, many members of the [[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] sports association. At that time the movement's underground newsletter, ''Ha'Metsudah'' (the Tower) also began publication, expressing the active trend of the movement. The Irgun also increased its numbers by expanding draft regiments of Beitar - groups of volunteers, committed to two years of security and pioneer activities. These regiments were based in places that from which stemmed new Irgun strongholds in the many places, including the settlements of [[Yesod HaMa'ala]], [[Mishmar Ha'Yarden]], [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]], [[Metula]] and [[Nahariya]] in the north; in the center - [[Hadera]], [[Binyamina]], [[Herzliya]], [[Netanya]] and [[Kfar Sava]], and south of there - [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Rehovot]] and [[Ness Ziona]]. Later on regiments were also active in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] ("the Kotel Brigades") among others. Primary training centers were based in [[Ramat Gan]], Qastina (by [[Kiryat Mal'akhi]] of today) and other places.

===Under Tehomi's command===
[[Image:Tehomi.jpg|thumb|Avraham Tehomi, The First Commander of the Irgun]]
From 1936 to 1939 there was a relative calm in Palestine. In 1933 there some signs of unrest, seen by the incitement of the local Arab leadership to act against the government. The strong British response put down the disturbances quickly, and the peace was kept. During that time the Irgun operated in a similar manner to the Haganah and was a guarding organization. The two organizations cooperated in ways such as coordination of posts and even intelligence sharing.

In protest against, and with the aim of ending Jewish immigration to Palestine, the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Great Arab Revolt of 1936-1939]] broke out on April 19, 1936. The riots took the form of attacks by Arab rioters ambushing main roads, bombing of roads and settlements as well as property and agriculture vandalism. In the beginning, the Irgun and the Haganah generally maintained a policy of restraint, apart from a few instances. Some expressed resentment at this policy, leading up internal unrest in the two organizations. The Irgun tended a bit more to retaliate, and sometimes Irgun members patrolled areas beyond their positions in order to encounter attackers ahead of time. However, there were differences of opinion regarding what to do in the Haganah, as well. Due to the joining of many [[Beitar]] Youth members, Jabotinsky (founder of Beitar) had a great deal of influence over Irgun policy. Nevertheless, Jabotinsky was of the opinion that for moral reasons violent retaliation was not to be undertaken.

During the first stage of the Revolt, from April 1936 until October of that year, 80 Jews were killed, 369 were injured, 19 schools were attacked, nine orphanages and three old-age homes. 380 attacks on trains and buses were carried out, and approximately 4,000 acres of agricultural land were destroyed. These actions were carried out by armed Arab gangs who were joined by Syrian and Iraqi reinforcements. The Supreme Arab Committee, led by [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni|Haj Amin al-Husayni]], who directed these riots, also declared a general strike on labor and trade. In the beginning of October 1936 gang activity declined due to the intervention of the British Army.

In November 1936 the [[Peel Commission]] was sent to inquire regarding the breakout of the riots and propose a solution to end the Revolt. In early 1937 there were still some in the [[Yishuv]] who felt the commission would recommend a partition of the land west of the [[Jordan River]], thus creating a Jewish state on part of the land. The Irgun leadership, as well as the "Supervisory Committee" held similar beliefs, as did some members of the Haganah and the [[Jewish Agency]]. This belief strengthened the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]] and led to the position that there was no room for defense institutions in the future Jewish state. Tehomi was quoted as saying: "We stand before great events: a Jewish state and a Jewish army. There is a need for a single military force". This position intensified the differences of opinion regarding the policy of restraint, both within the Irgun and within the political camp aligned with the organization. The leadership committee of the Irgun supported a merge with the Haganah. On April 24, 1937 a referendum was held among Irgun members regarding its continued independent existence. David Raziel and Avraham (Yair) Stern came out publicly in support for the continued existence of the Irgun:
:''"The Irgun has been placed... before a decision to make, whether to submit to the authority of the government and the Jewish Agency or to prepare for a double sacrifice and endangerment. Some of our friends do not have appropriate willingness for this difficult position, and have submitted to the Jewish Agency and has left the battle... all of the attempts... to unite with the leftist organization have failed, because the Left entered into negotiations not on the basis of unification of forces, but the submission of one such force to the other..."''<ref>Yosef Kister, ''The Etzel'', (Hebrew) pp. 38</ref>

===The first split===
In April 1937 the Irgun split after the referendum. Approxmiately 1,500-2,000 people, about half of the Irgun's membership, including the senior command staff, regional committee members, along with most of the Irgun's weapons, returned to the [[Haganah]], which at that time was under the Jewish Agency's leadership. In their opinion, in order to remove the Haganah from the Jewish Agency's leadership to the national institutions necessitated their return. Furthermore, they no longer saw significant ideological differences between the movements. Those who remained in the Irgun were primarily young activists, mostly laypeople, who sided with the independent existence of the Irgun. In fact, most of those who remained were originally Beitar people. Moshe Rosenberg estimated that approximately 1,800 members remained. In theory, the Irgun remain an organization not aligned with a political party, but in reality the supervisory committee was disbanded and the Irgun's continued ideological path was outlined according Ze'ev Jabotinsky's school of thought and his decisions, until the movement eventually became Revisionist Zionism's military arm. One of the major changes in policy by Jabotinsky's was the end of the policy [[Havlagah|restraint]].

On April 27, 1937 the Irgun founded a new headquarters, staffed by Moshe Rosenberg at the head, [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] as secretary, David Raziel as head of the Jerusalem branch, Hanoch Kalai as commander of Haifa and Aharon Haichman as commander of Tel Aviv. On the 20th of [[Tammuz (month)|Tammuz]], (June 29) the day of [[Theodor Herzl|Theodor Herzl's]] death, a ceremony was held in honor of the reorganization of the underground movement. For secrecy purposes the ceremony was held at a construction site in Tel Aviv.

Ze'ev Jabotinsky placed Col. Robert Bitker at the head of the Irgun. Bitker had previously served a Beitar commissioner in China and had military experience. A few months later, probably due to total incompatibility with the position, Jabotinsky replaced Bitker with Moshe Rosenberg. When the [[Peel Commission]] report was published a few months later, the Revisionist camp decided not to accept the commission's recommendations. Moreover, the organizations of Beitar, [[Hatzohar]] and the Irgun began to increase their efforts to bring Jews to the land of Israel, illegally. This [[Aliyah]] was known as the עליית אף על פי "Af Al Pi (Nevertheless) Aliyah". As opposed to this position, the Jewish Agency began acting on behalf of the Zionist interest on the political front, and continued the policy of restraint. From this point onwards the differences between the Haganah and the Irgun were much more prominent.

===Illegal Aliyah===
[[Image:Parita22839.jpg|thumb|The ship ''Parita'' unloading immigrants at the beach in Tel Aviv]]
According to Jabotinsky's "Evacuation Plan", which called for millions of European Jews to be brought to Palestine at once, the Irgun helped the [[Aliyah Bet|illegal immigration]] of European Jews to the land of Israel. This was named by Jabotinsky the "National Sport". The most significant part of this illegal immigration prior to [[World War II]] was carried out by the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] camp, largely because the [[Yishuv]] institutions and the Jewish Agency shied away from such an expensive illegal project, as well as the belief that Britain would in the future allow widespread Jewish immigration. 

The Irgun joined forces with [[Hatzohar]] and [[Betar|Beitar]] in September 1937, when it assisted with the Aliyah of a convoy of 54 Beitar members at Tantura Beach (near [[Haifa]]). The Irgun was responsible for discreetly bringing the [[Olim]] to the beaches, and dispersing them among the various Jewish settlements. The Irgun also began participating in the organizing of the immigration enterprise and undertook the process of accompanying the ships. This began with the ship ''Draga'' that arrived at the shores of land of Israel in September 1938. In August of the same year, an agreement was made between Ari Jabotinsky (the son of Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the Beitar representative and [[Hillel Kook]], the Irgun representative, regarding the coordination of the immigration (also known as [[Haapala]]). This agreement was also made in the "Paris Convention" in February 1939, at which also were present [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] and [[David Raziel]]. Afterwards, the "Aliyah Center" was founded, made up of representatives of Hatzohar, Beitar, and the Irgun, thereby making the Irgun a full participant in the organization and execution process. 

The difficult conditions on the ships demanded a high level of discipline. The people on board the ships were often split into units, led by commanders. In addition to having daily roll call and the distribution of food and water (usually very little of both), organized talks were held to provide information regarding the actual arrival in Palestine. One of the largest ships was the ''Sakaria'', with 2,300 [[Olim]], who at the time made up 0.5% of the Jewish population in Palestine. The first vessel arrived on [[April 13]], [[1937]], and the last on [[February 13]], [[1940]]. All told, about 18,000 Jews reached Palestine with the help of the Revisionist organizations and private initiatives of other Revisionists. Most were not caught by the British.

===End of restraint===
[[Image:David raziel.jpg|thumb|David Raziel, commander of the Irgun]]
Irgun members continued to defend settlements, but at the same time began counter-attacks, thus ending the policy of restraint. These attacks were intended to instill fear in the Arab side, in order to cause the Arabs to wish for peace and quiet. In March 1938, David Raziel wrote in the underground newspaper "By the Sword" a constitutive article for the Irgun overall, in which he coined the term '''"Active Defense"''':
:''"The actions of the Haganah alone will never be a true victory. If the goal of the war is to break the will of the enemy - and this cannot be attained without destroying his spirit - clearly we cannot be satisfied with solely defensive operations... Such a method of defense, that allows the enemy to attack at will, to reorganize and attack again... and does not intend to remove the enemy's ability to attack a second time - is called passive defense, and ends in downfall and destruction... whoever does not wish to be beaten has no choice by to attack. The fighting side, that does not intend to oppress but to save its liberty and honor, he too has only one way available - the way of attack. Defensiveness by way out offensiveness, in order to deprive the enemy the option of attacking, is called ''active defense''."''

The first operations begain around April 1936, and by the end of World War II, more than 250 Arabs were killed. The trend of activities was an attempt to respond "[[an eye for an eye]]" in the form of violent operations against Arab violence, and oftentimes to design the form of retaliation or its location to correspond to the attack that prevoked it. A number of examples:
*After an Arab shooting at "Carmel" school in Tel Aviv, which resulted in the death of Jewish child, Irgun members attacked an Arab neighborhood near [[Kerem Hatemanim]] in Tel Aviv, killing one Arab man and injured another.
*On August 17, the Irgun responded to shootings by Arabs from the [[Jaffa]]-[[Jerusalem]] train towards Jews that were waiting by the train block on Herzl St. in Tel Aviv. The same day, when a Jewish child was injured by the shooting, Irgun members attacked a train on the same route, killing one Arab and injuring five.
During 1936 Irgun members carried out approximately ten retaliatory operations.

Throughout 1937 the Irgun continued this line of operation.
*On March 6, a Jew praying the Sabbath prayers at the [[Western Wall]] was shot by a local Arab. A few hours later the Irgun  shot at an Arab in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Rechavia.
*On June 29, a band of Arabs attacked an [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus on the Jerusalem - Tel Aviv road, killing one Jew. The following day, two Jews were also killed near [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Karkur]]. A few hours later, the Irgun carried out a number of operations.
**An Arab bus making its way from [[Lifta]] was attacked in Jerusalem.
**In two other locations in Jerusalem, Arabs were shot as well.
**In Tel Aviv, a hand grenade was thrown at an Arab coffee shop on Carmel St., injuring many of the patrons.
**Irgun members also injured an Arab on Reines St. in Tel Aviv.
**On September 5, the Irgun responded to the murder of a rabbi on his way home from prayer in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] by throwing explosives at an Arab bus that had left Lifta, injuring two female passengers and a British police officer.

A more complete list can be found [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|here]].

At that time, however, these acts were not yet a part of a formulated policy of the Irgun.<ref>"Tagar u'Magen (Jabotinsky and the Etzel)" {{he icon}}, Jabtotinsky Publishing, pp. 28</ref> Not all of the aforementioned operations received a commander's approval, and Jabotinsky was not in favor of such actions at the time. Jabotinsky still hoped to establish a Jewish force out in the open that would not have to operate underground. However, the failure, in its eyes, of the [[Peel Commission]] and the renewal of violence on the part of the Arabs caused the Irgun to rethink its official policy.

===Increase in operations===
November 14, 1937 was a watershed in Irgun activity. It was on this day that the Irgun increased its reprisals. Following an increase in attacks aimed at Jews, including the killing of five [[kibbutz]] members near [[Kiryat Anavim]] (today Ma'aleh Ha'Chamisha Kibbutz), the Irgun started a series of attacks in various places in Jerusalem, killing five Arabs. A number of operations were also undertaken in [[Haifa]] (shooting at the Arab-populated Wadi Nisnas neighborhood) and in [[Herzliya]]. This day is known as the day the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]] ended, or as "Black Sunday". This is when the organization fully changed its policy, with the approval of Jabotinsky and Headquarters to the policy of "active defense" regarding actions for which the Irgun took responsibility.<ref>"The Birth of an Underground Organization", Yehuda Lapidot, pp. 62 {{he icon}}</ref>

The British responded with the arrest of Beitar and Hatzohar members for suspecting they were members of the Irgun. The military courts were allowed to act under "Time of Emergency Regulations" and even sentence people to death. In this manner Yehezkel Altman, a guard in a Beitar battalion in the Nahalat Yizchak neighborhood of Tel Aviv, shot at an Arab bus, without his commanders' knowledge. Altman thus was acting in response to a shooting at Jewish vehicles on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road the day before. He turned himself in later and was sentenced to death, a sentence which was later commuted to a life sentence.

Despite the arrests, Irgun members continued fighting. Jabotinsky lended his moral support to these activities. In a later to Moshe Rosenberg from March 18, 1938 he wrote:
:''"Tell them: from afar I collect and save, as precious treasures, news items about your lives. I know of the obstacles that have not impeded your spirit; and I know of your actions as well. I am overjoyed that I have been blessed with such students."''

The Irgun continued activities such as these, however under Rosenberg's orders they were greatly curtailed. Furthermore, in fear of the British making good on their threat to sentence someone to death if found carrying a weapon, all operations were suspended for eight months. However, opposition to this policy gradually increased over time. On April 21, 1938, in response to the murder of six Jews, which included the rape and dismemberment of a woman, Beitar members from the [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]] Brigade went on a reprisal mission, without the consent of their commanders, as described by historian [[Avi Shlaim]].
:''On 21 April 1938, after several weeks of planning, he and two of his colleagues from the Irgun (Etzel) ambushed an Arab bus at a bend on a mountain road near Safad. They had a hand-grenade, a gun and a pistol. Their plan was to destroy the engine so that the bus would fall off the side of the road and all the passengers would be killed. When the bus approached, they fired at it (not in the air, as Mailer has it) but the grenade lobbed by Ben Yosef did not detonate. The bus with its screaming and terrified passengers drove on.''<ref>{{cite web

Although the incident ended without casualties, the three were caught, and one of them - [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] was sentenced to death. Demonstrations around the country, as well as pressure from institutions and people such as [[Haim Weizman|Dr. Chaim Weizmann]] and the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandatory Palestine]], [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]] did not change his sentence. In Shlomo Ben-Yosef's writings in Hebrew were later found: "I am going to die and I am not sorry at all. Why? Because I am going to die for our country. Shlomo Ben-Yosef." On June 29, 1938 he was executed, and was the first of [[Olei Hagardom]]. The Irgun revered him after his death and was seen as an example by many.

In light of this, and due to the anger in the Irgun leadership over the decision to adopt a policy of restraint until that point, Jabotinsky relieved Rosenberg of his post and appointed [[David Raziel]] in his stead. Raziel would prove to be the most prominent of Irgun commanders until [[Menachem Begin]]. Jabotinsky likewise instructed the Irgun to end their policy of restraint, and the Irgun carried out armed offensive operations until the end of the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab Revolt]]. The Irgun carried out such operations against Arab villages and the Arab population in approximately 40 different times. A number of examples:
*After a Jewish father and son were killed in the Old City of Jerusalem, Irgun members, on June 6, 1938 threw an explosive from the roof of a nearby house, killing two Arabs and injuring four.
*The Irgun planted [[land mine]]s in a number of Arab [[Souk|markets]], primarily in places identified by the Irgun as activity centers of armed Arab gangs.
**An explosive detonated in the Arab [[souk]] in Jerusalem on July 15, killing ten local Arabs.
**In similar circumstances, 70 Arabs were killed from a land mine planted in the Arab souk in Haifa.

This action brought the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] to discuss the disturbances in Palestine. On February 23, 1939 the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Malcolm MacDonald]] revealed the British intention to cancel the [[British Mandate of Palestine|mandate over Palestine]] and establish a state that would preserve the Arabs' rights. This caused a wave of riots and attacks by Arabs against Jews. The Irgun responded four days later with a series of attacks on Arab buses and other sites. The British used military forces against the Arab rioters and in the last period of the "revolt" the Arab community in Palestine deteriorated into a state of internal gang wars.

====During the same period====
In reality, the armed operations against Arabs were the actions of small groups, or even individual Irgun members. Most of the Irgun dealt at the time with protection and defense of settlements. The Irgun at the time was made up of Beitar youth (from its branches or from its work brigades), Hazohar members and the National Workers Union, youth belonging to the [[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] youth group, members of the religious youth group "Alliance of the Hasmoneans" and students from the national unions ''Yavneh'', ''Yodfat'' and ''Elal''. In certain places, including settlements in [[Samaria]], the [[Sharon plain|Sharon]] and southern [[Judea]] these were the primary defensive forces. In some areas Irgun forces cooperated with [[Haganah]] members. One place the Haganah helped establish was Tel Zur (now known as [[Even-Yehuda]]), a [[Tower and stockade|Tower and Stockade]] settlement belonging to the Beitar movement.

At the same time, the Irgun established itself in Europe, as well. The Irgun established underground cells that participated in organizing Aliyah convoys. The cells were made up almost entirely of Beitar members, and their primary activity was military training in preparation for immigration to Palestine. Ties formed with the Polish authorities brought about courses  in which Irgun commanders were trained by Polish officers in advanced military issues such as [[guerrilla warfare]], [[Tactic (method)|tactics]] and placing [[land mine]]s. [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] was notable among the cell organizers in Europe. In 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the underground. The transfer of handguns, rifles, explosives and ammunition stopped with the outbreak of World War II. Another field in which the Irgun operated was the training of pilots, so they could serve in the [[Air Force]] in the future war for independence, in the flight school in [[Lod]].

Towards the end of 1938 there was progress towards certain amount of ideological similarity between the Irgun and the Haganah. Many rid themselves of the illusion that a Jewish state would be soon exist on that divided land. The Haganah founded פו"מ, a special operations unit, (pronounced ''poom''), which carried out armed operations in response to, and in order to prevent Arab violence. There operations continued until 1939. Furthermore, the opposition within the [[Yishuv]] to [[Aliyah Bet|illegal immigration]] significantly lessened, and the Haganah began to bring Jews to Palestine using rented ships, as the Irgun had done in the past.

===First operations against the British===
The publishing of [[MacDonald White Paper]] in May 1939 brought with it new edicts that adversely affected the continued development of the Jewish community. Chief among these was the prohibition on selling land to Jews and minuscule quotas for the immigration of Jews. The entire Yishuv was furious at the contents of the White Paper. There were demonstrations held against the White Paper and it was known as the "Treacherous Paper" because it was seen as the by the Jews ultimate betrayal of the British, and in their desire to establish a Jewish homeland in the land of Israel. The Irgun began sabotaging British facilities such as electricity facilities, radio and telephone lines. In addition the Irgun started publicly distributing news items about its activity and its goals. This was done in street announcements, newspapers, as well as the underground radio station [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]]. The British on their part made numerous arrests of [[Betar|Beitar]] and [[Hatzohar]] members, some of whom were tortured in order to obtain information about the Irgun. The Irgun warned that such activity would result in their response, and on August 26, 1939 the Irgun published a death sentence against Ralph Krans, a British police officer who served as head of the Jewish Department in their secret police and himself tortured a number of youths who were underground members. Krans and another British officer in the secret police were killed from a hidden mine explosion by the Irgun. The British increased their efforts against the Irgun and as a part of these efforts [[David Raziel]], commander of the Irgun was arrested on May 19. On August 31 the British police arrested members of the Irgun headquarters during a meeting of theirs. And on [[September 1]], [[1939]] World War II broke out.

===During World War II===
After the war broke out [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] and the [[New Zionist Organization]] voiced their support for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]. In mid-September 1939 David Raziel was moved from his place of detention in [[Tzrifin]] which, among other events, caused the Irgun to announce a cessation of its activities against the British so as to hinder Britain's effort to fight "the Hebrew's greatest enemy in the world - German [[Nazism]]". This announcement ended with the hope that after the war a Hebrew state would be founded "within the historical borders of the liberated homeland". After this announcement Irgun, Beitar and Hatzohar members, including David Raziel and the Irgun leadership, were gradually released from arrest. The Irgun did not rule out joining the British Army and Irgun members did enlist to various army units.<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgun.html</ref>

There were instances of Beitar members enlisted in the British military smuggling British weapons to the Irgun. Irgun members participated in the war against the Nazis and served in the [[Jewish Brigade]]. Irgun members also assisted the British forces with intelligence in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], as well as [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. An Irgun unit also operated in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. David Raziel later gave his life in such an operation in the service of Britain.

During the [[Holocaust]] Beitar members revolted numerous times against the [[Nazis]] in occupied Europe. The largest of these revolts was during the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] where an armed underground organization fought, comprised of Beitar, Hatzohar and Polish Irgun cell members, known as ''[[Jewish Military Union|Żydowski Związek Wojskowy]]'', Polish for Jewish Military Union. From 1939 onwards, an Irgun delegation in the [[United States]], worked for the creation of a Hebrew army, to fight alongside the Allied Forces, to be made up of Jewish refugees and Jews from Palestine. This delegation earned the support of many public officials, yet was never established according to the proposed model. In July 1943 the "Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People in Europe" and until the end of the war it worked to rescue the Jews of Europe from the Nazis and to garner public support. However it took until January 1944 until President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] established the [[War Refugee Board]], which did achieve some success in saving Jews in Europe.

===The second split===
[[Image:AvStern.jpg|thumb|Avraham (Yair) Stern]]
Throughout this entire period the British continued enforcing the [[MacDonald White Paper]], the ban on the sale of land to Jews, as well the complete cessation of legal Jewish immigration alongside the increase in enforcement against illegal immigration.

Within the ranks of the Irgun this created much disappointment and unrest, at the center of which was disagreement with the leadership of the [[New Zionist Organization]], David Raziel and the Irgun Headquarters. On June 18, 1939 Avraham (Yair) Stern and others of the leadership were released from prison and an open rift was created between them the Irgun and [[Hatzohar]] leadership. The controversial issues were the submission of the underground movement to public political leadership and the issue of fighting the British. When Raziel was released from prison he announced his resignation to Headquarters. To his chagrin independent operations of senior members of the Irgun were carried out and even some commanders who doubted Raziel's loyalty. In this stead, Stern was elected to lead. Beitar and Hatzohar members resented this appointment because it was seen as undermining Jabotinsky's authority. Stern, in the past, founded the secret Irgun cells in Poland without Jabotinsky's knowledge, in opposition to his opinion. Furthermore, Stern was in favor of removing the Irgun from the authority of New Zionist Organization. The leadership of the New Zionist Organization urged Raziel to return to the command of the Irgun, and he finally consented. Jabotinsky wrote letters to David Raziel and to Avraham (Yair) Stern which were distributed in the branches of the Irgun. He wrote to Raziel:
:''"...I call upon you: Let nothing disturb our unity. Listen to the commissioner (Raizel), whom I trust, and promise me that you and [[Betar|Beitar]], the greatest of my life's achievements, will stand strong and united and allow me to continue with the hope for victory in the war to realize our old [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] dream..."''

Stern was sent a telegram with an order to obey Raziel, who was reappointed. However, these events did not prevent the splitting of the organization. Suspicion and distrust were rampant among the members. Out of the Irgun a new organization was created on July 17, 1940<ref>http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac05.htm</ref>, which was first named "The National Military Organization in Israel" (as opposed to the "National Military Organization in '''the Land of''' Israel") and later on changed its name to [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], an acronym for '''Lohamei Herut Israel''', "Fighters for the Freedom of Israel", (לח"י - לוחמי חירות ישראל). Jabotinsky died in [[New York]], on August 4, 1940, from a heartstroke while visiting an armed Jewish self-defense camp run by [[Betar|Beitar]] facilities, yet this did not prevent the break off of Lehi.

The primary difference between the Irgun and the newly formed organization was its intention to fight the British in Palestine, regardless of their war against Germany. Later on additional operational and ideological differences developed that contradicted some of the Irgun's guiding principles. For example the Lehi supported the exchange of population with regards to the local Arabs. The Irgun, on the other hand, acted according the Revisionist school of thought that said "There he shall quench his thirst with plenty and happiness, the son of Arab, son of Nazareth (i.e. Christian) and my son". Moreover, the Irgun's fight against the British was only intended to expel them from the area, and the option of future diplomatic ties with Britain was not discounted. The Lehi, however, declared total war against imperialism and the empire. Also unlike Irgun fighters, Lehi fighters would travel with their weapon on them at all times. One more striking difference was the fact that the Irgun directed its struggle with the British against its centers of government and its facilities, and sometimes warned the British about impending explosions. This, compared with the Lehi that at times directed its struggle at personal attacks and assassinations of leadership, military, and police figures.

The split hurt the Irgun from both an organizational and a morale point of view. As their spiritual leader, Jabotinsky's death in August 1940 also added to this feeling. The mourning, compounded with the split in the organization, brought about a mass abandonment of members. The British secret police took advantage of this weakness to gather intelligence and arrest Irgun activists. The new Irgun leadership, which included Meridor, Yerachmiel Ha'Levi, Moshe Segal and others used the forced recess in activity to rebuild the injured organization. This period was also marked by more cooperation between the Irgun and the Jewish Agency, however [[David Ben Gurion|Ben Gurion's]] uncompromising demand that Irgun accept the Jewish Agency's command foiled any further cooperation.

In both the Irgun and the Haganah more and more voices were being heard opposing any sort of cooperation with the British. Nevertheless, an Irgun operation carried out in the service of Britain was aimed at sabotaging pro-Nazi forces in [[Iraq]], including the assassination of [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]]. Among others, David Raziel and [[Yaakov Meridor]] participated. On April 20, 1941, during a [[Luftwaffe|German]] aerial bombing of Habbaniya Airport near [[Baghdad]], David Raziel, commander of the Irgun, was killed before the operation was completed.

As mentioned, the mandatory authorities did loosen at all regarding the new rules set out in the [[MacDonald White Paper]]. This included the sending back of the "Atlantic" ship back to Europe, with all of 1,584 passengers on board, the accidental sinking of the "[[Patria disaster|Patria]]" other tragedies, and the [[Soviet]] sinking of the "[[Struma (ship)|Struma]]" in February 1942, after having being deported by the British from Palestine.

Towards late 1943 a joint Haganah - Irgun initiative was brought up, to form a single fighting body, unaligned with any political party, by the name of עם לוחם (''Fighting Nation'').<ref>http://www.palmach.org.il/show_item.asp?levelId=38612&itemId=5199&itemType=0 {{he icon}}</ref><ref>http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/1146</ref> The body's first plan was to kidnap the High Commissioner of [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]], who was at the time [[Harold MacMichael|Sir Harold MacMichael]] and deport him to [[Cyprus]]. However the Haganah leaked the joint organizing with the Irgun and the plan for a new body was thwarted by the underground movements before it got off the ground. Nevertheless, at this stage the Irgun ceased its cooperation with the British. As [[List of notable Irgun members|Eliyahu Lankin]] tells in his book: "Immediately following the failure of ''Fighting Nation'' practical discussions began in the Irgun Headquarters regarding a declaration of war."

===Revolt===
In 1941 [[Menachem Begin]] was arrived in Palestine as a soldier in the Polish army-in-exile,<ref>http://www.ibiblio.org/sullivan/bios/MenachemBegin-Bio.html</ref> known as [[Anders Army|"Anders Army"]], which was commanded by [[Władysław Anders]]. His arrival created newfound expectations with the Irgun and [[Betar|Beitar]]. Begin was had served as head of the Beitar movement in Poland,<ref>http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/begin-bio.html</ref> and was a respected leader. [[Yaakov Meridor]], then the commander of the Irgun, raised the idea of appointing Begin to the post. In late 1943, when Begin accepted the position, a new leadership was formed. Meridor became Begin's deputy, and other members of the board were Aryeh Ben Eliezer, Eliyahu Lankin, and Shlomo Lev Ami.<ref name="etzel06">http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac06.htm</ref>

On February 1, 1944 the Irgun put out posters all around the country, proclaiming a revolt against the British mandatory government. The posters said, among other things:

It started by saying that all of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movements stood by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] and over 25,000 Jews had enlisted in the British military. The hope to establish a Jewish army had died. Throughout the war the Arabs of the [[Middle East]] were on [[Germany|Germany's]] side. European Jewry was trapped and was being destroyed, yet Britain, on its part, did not allow any rescue missions. This part of the document ends with the following words:
:''"[[MacDonald White Paper|The White Paper]] is still in effect. It is enforced, despite the betrayal of the Arabs and the loyalty of the Jews; despite the mass enlisting to the British Army; despite the [[ceasefire]] and the quiet in The Land of Israel; despite the massacre of masses of the Jewish people in Europe...''

:''The facts are simple and horrible as one. Over the last four years of [[World War II|the war]] we have [[Holocaust|lost millions]] of the  best of our people; millions more are in danger of eradication. And The Land of Israel is closed off and quarantined because the British rule it, realizing the White Paper, and strives for the destruction of our people's last hope."

The Irgun then declares that, on its part, the ceasefire is over and there is now war against the British. The Irgun demands the transfer of rule over the land to a Jewish government, which must implement ten clauses. Among them are the mass evacuation of Jews from Europe, signing treaties with any state that recognizes the Jewish state's soveriegnty, including Britain, granting social justice to the state's residents, and full equality to the Arab population.

The proclamation ends with: "The Gods of Israel, God of Hosts, will be at our side. There is no retreat. Liberty or death. ... The fighting youth will not recoil in the face of sacrifices and suffering, blood and torment. They will not surrender, so long as our days of old are not renewed, so long as our nation is not ensured a homeland, liberty, honor, bread, justice and law."''

The Irgun began this campaign rather weakly - the organization was only about 1,000 people strong, out of which only approximately 200 fighters. Weapons were also sparse. The Irgun underwent a reorganization and was redivided in different brigades: '''Combat Corps''' - the Irgun's primary fighting force, '''The Sea''' - the Irgun's special operations unit, Delek (דלק, gasoline) - intelligence, HATAM (חת"מ, stands for Revolutionary Publicity Corps) - in charge of publicity, and HAT (ח"ת, stands for Planning Division). The Irgun became more secretive and its commanders assumed new identities and homes. Begin, for example, assummed a Rabbi's identity ("Yisrael Sasover"), and was sometimes known as "Ben Ze'ev" or "Dr. Kenigshopper".

===Struggle against the British===
The Irgun began attacking the British symbols of government, in an attempt to harm the regime's operation as well as its reputation. The Irgun made a rule for itself - no individual terror and an attempt to avoid causalties.<ref name="etzel06"/> The first attack was on February 12, 1944 at the government immigration offices, a symbol of the immigration laws. The attacks went smoothly and ended with no causalities, as they were on a Saturday night, when the buildings were empty, in the three largest cities: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. On February 27 the income tax offices<ref>"The chief instrument for the exploitation of the Hebrew worker and citizen by the government of betrayal."</ref> in the same cities were blown up, also on a Saturday night. Prior warnings were put up near the buildings and again the operation went smoothly.<ref name="etzel06"/> On March 23 the national headquarters building of the British police, in the [[Migrash Harusim|Russian Compound]] in Jerusalem was attacked, and part of it was blown up. These attacks in the first few months were sharply condemned by the organized leadership of the Yishuv and by the Jewish Agency, who saw them as dangerous provocations.

At the same time the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] also renewed its attacks against the British.<ref>[http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/120/Chapter+Eight+The+Struggle+for+the+Establishment+of+the+State+of+Israel.htm Chapter Eight: The Struggle for the Establishment of the State of Israel]</ref> The Irgun continued to attack police stations and headquarters, and [[Tegart fort|Tegart Fort]], a fortified police station (today the location of [[Latrun]]). One relatively complex operation was overtaking of the governmental radio station in [[Ramallah]], on May 17, 1944.

One symbolic act by the Irgun happened before [[Yom Kippur]] of 1944. They plastered notices around town, warning that no British officers should come to the [[Western Wall]] on Yom Kippur, and for the first time since the mandate began no British police officers were there to prevent the Jews from the traditional [[Shofar]] blowing at the end of the fast.<ref>http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/history/hayom/2a-2.htm {{he icon}}</ref> After the fast that year the Irgun attacked four police stations in Arabs settlements. In order to obtain weapons, the Irgun carried out "confiscation" operations - they took over British weapon centers and smuggle weapons to Irgun hiding places. During this phase of activity the Irgun also cut all of its official ties with the [[New Zionist Organization]], so as not to tie their fate in the underground organization.

Menachem Begin in his [[memoir]] ''The Revolt'':
:''"History and experience taught us that if we are able to destroy the prestige of the British in Palestine, the regime will break. Since we found the enslaving government's weak point, we did not let go of it"''.<ref>{{cite book

===Underground exiles===
[[Image:GoleyAfrica.jpg|thumb|Exiles to Africa in a Camp in [[Sembel]], 1946. The sign says "If I Forget Thee, O Jerusalem, Let My Right Hand Wither"]]
In October 1944 the British began expelling hundreds of arrested Irgun and Lehi members to detention camps in Africa. 251 detainees from [[Latrun]] were flown on thirteen planes, on October 19 to a camp in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]]. Eleven additional transports were made. Throughout the period of their detention, the detainees often initiated rebellions and hunger strikes. Many escape attempts were made until July 1948 when the exiled were returned to Israel. Many of these attempts were successful, but only mildly. While there were numerous successes in escaping the camp itself, but only nine men actually succeeded in making it all the way back and continue their activity in the underground movements. One noted such success was [[Yaakov Meridor|Yaakov Meridor's]], who escaped '''nine''' time until he managed to reach Europe in April 1948. These tribulations were the subject of his book ''Long is the Path to Freedom: Chronicles of one of the Exiles''.

===Hunting Season===
On November 6, 1944 the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi's]] [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne#Assassination|assassination]] of [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], British Deputy Resident Minister of State in [[Cairo]] by [[Eliyahu Hakim]] and [[Eliyahu Bet-Zuri]]. This act raised concerns within the Yishuv from the British regime's reaction to the underground's violent acts against them. Therefore the Jewish Agency decided on starting a '''Hunting Season'''<ref>http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac07.htm</ref><ref>http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/history/lapidot/8.htm</ref>, known as the ''saison'', (from the [[French language|French]] "la saison de chasse"). During the Hunting Season people suspected of belonging to or supporting the Irgun or the Lehi were removed schools, work places and the ''Klalit'' [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]]. Most of the people who partook in these activities were members of the Haganah and the [[Palmach]]. The carried out surveillance, kidnapping, investigation of Irgun and Lehi members and either turned them over to the British, or provided details regarding their whereabouts. Among those turned over where members of the Irgun headquarters - [[Yaakov Meridor]], Shlomo Lev Ami, and Eliyahu Lankin.

From the very start of these acitivies the Irgun leadership demanded all levels of the movement act with complete restraint. Although this policy had many opponents, Menachem Begin put his full weight behind it, in order to prevent a [[civil war]]<ref>http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/ezrachut/begin/44_10-2.htm {{he icon}}</ref>:
:''"Whatever shall be, our soldiers shall not use their weapons against Jewish opponents... not even to prevent the highest price of sacrifice, not even to prevent liquidation."''

The Hunting Season managed to paralyze the Irgun's activity for a few months, but not destroy the organization. The Irgun's recuperation was noticeable when ot began to renew its cooperation with the Lehi in May 1945, when it carried out sabotage operations of oil pipelines, telephone lines and railroad bridges. All in all, over 1000 members of the Irgun and Lechi were arrested and interred in British camps during the ''Saison''. All in all, over 1000 members of the Irgun and Lechi were arrested and interred in British camps during the ''Saison''. Eventually the Hunting Season died out, and there was even talk of cooperation with the [[Haganah]] leading to the formation of [[The Jewish Resistance Movement]].

===The Jewish Resistance Movement===
{{main|The Jewish Resistance Movement}}
[[Image:King david hotel bombing.jpg|thumb|The King David Hotel After the Bombing]]
Towards the end of July 1945 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] party in Britain rose to power. The Yishuv leadership had high hopes that this would change the anti-Zionist policy that the British maintained at the time. However, these hopes were quickly laid to rest after the government limited [[Aliyah]] with the intent that the population of western Palestine (west of the [[Jordan River]]) would not be more than one third of the total. This, along with the stepping up of arrests and their pursuit of underground members and [[Aliyah Bet|illegal immigration]] led to the formation of the [[The Jewish Resistance Movement|Jewish Resistance Movement]], which consolidated the armed resistance to the British of the Irgun, Lehi, and the Haganah. For ten months the Irgun and the Lehi cooperated and they carried out nineteen attacks and defense operations. The Haganah and the Palmach carried out ten such operations. Furthermore, the Haganah assisted in bringing over 13,000 illegal immigrants.

Tension between the underground movements and the British increased with the increase in operations. On April 23, 1945 an operation undertaken by the Irgun in [[Tegart fort|Tegart Fort]] went badly and gunfights broke out. One Irgun member was killed and his body was later hanged on the fort's fence. Another fighter, Yizchak Bilu, was killed as well in a distraction attempt - an explosive fell out of his hand, and he lept onto it in order to save his comrades, who were also carrying explosives. Also in the operation Dov Gruner was caught. He stood trial and was sentenced to be executed by hanging, and he refused to sign a pardon request.<ref>http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac14.htm</ref> He was later hanged on April 16, 1947<ref>[[Olei Hagardom]]</ref>

British policy towards the Yishuv worsened, at the height of which was [[Operation Agatha]]. They turned down the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry|Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry's]] recommendation to bring 100,000 Jews to Palestine at once.  As a result of the finding of documents tying the Jewish Agency to The Jewish Resistance Movement the Irgun was asked to speed up the plans for the [[King David Hotel bombing]];<ref>Jabotinsky Institute Archives (k-4 1/11/5)</ref> which was where the documents were located, the base for the British Secretariat, the military command, and a branch of the Criminal Investigation Division (police). On July 22 the Irgun bombed the King David Hotel. The Irgun later said that a warning sent out ahead of time was never taken seriously.<ref>Menachem Begin, ''The Revolt''. 1951, pp. 221</ref> According to [[Shmuel Katz]], in his book ''Days of Fire'', "The Haganah radio later broadcast a report that on receiving the warning Sir John Shaw, the Chief Secretary of the British administration, had said: "I give orders here. I don't take orders from Jews", and that he had insisted that nobody leave the building. The bombing killed 91 people. The Jewish Agency and the Haganah shied away from taking responsibility for the attack and condemned it sharply. One of the dead was Jewish and Etzel sympathizer Yulius Jacobs. Menachem Begin reportedly was very saddened and upset. He was angry that the British did not evacuate and so there were casualties, which was against the Irgun's policy.<ref>Katz, Shmuel. ''Days of Fire''. Karni Press, 1966, p.196-197.{{he icon}} </ref>

===Independent struggle against the British===
The [[King David Hotel bombing]] and the arrest of Jewish Agency and other Yishuv leaders as part of [[Operation Agatha]] caused the Haganah to cease their armed resistance activity against the British. Yishuv and Jewish Agency leaders were released from prison at [[Tegart fort|Tegart Fort]]. From then until the end of the British mandate the resistance was led by the Irgun and Lehi. In early September 1946 the Irgun renewed its attacks, against railroads, communication lines, and bridges. One prominent operation was the attack on the train station in Jerusalem, in which [[Meir Feinstein]] was arrested and later executed. According to the Irgun these sort of operations were legitimate, since the trains et al. primarily served the British, for redeployment of their forces. For a while the British stopped train traffic at night. The Irgun also publicized warnings, in three languages, not to use specific trains in danger of being attacked. The Irgun also re-established many representative offices internationally, and by 1948 operated in 23 states. In these countries the Irgun sometimes acted against the local British representatives or led public relations campaigns against Britain. On [[October 31]] [[1946]], in response to the British barring entry of Jews from Palestine, the Irgun blew up the British embassy in [[Rome]].<ref>J. Bowyer Bell, ''Terror out of Zion'' (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1977). pp.181</ref>

In December 1946 a sentence of 18 years and 18 beatings was handed down a young Irgun member. The Irgun made good on a threat they made and after the detainee was beaten, Irgun members kidnapped British officers and beat them in public. The operation, known as the "Night of the Beatings" brought an end to the British punishing Jews with beatings. The British, taking these acts seriously, moved many British families in Palestine into the confines of military bases, and some moved home.

On [[February 14]] [[1947]] [[Ernest Bevin]] announced that the Jews and Arabs would not be able to agree on any British proposed solution for the land, and therefore the issue must be brought to the [[United Nations]] for a final decision. The Yishuv thought of the idea to transfer the issue to the UN as a British attempt to save time until a UN inquiry commission would be established, and its ideas discussed, all the while the Yishuv would weaken. [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet|Foundation for Immigration B]] increased the number of ships which, in fact, saved the lives of European Jews. The British still strictly enforced the policy of immigration and illegal immigrants were placed in detention camps in [[Cyprus]], which only increased the anger of the Jewish community towards the mandatory government.

The Irgun stepped up its activity and from [[February 19]] until [[March 3]] it attacked 18 British military camps, convoy routes, vehicles, and other facilities. The most notable of these attacks was the destruction of the Goldschmidt House Officers Club in Jerusalem, which was in a heavily guarded compound.<ref>http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac12.htm</ref> Seventeen officers were killed in the attack. As a result, a curfew was imposed over much of the country, enforced by approximately 20,000 British soldiers. On [[March 3]] the leader of the opposition in the [[British House of Commons]] asked [[Winston Churchill]] if the size of the military force in Palestine was four times the size in India, at the price of £40,000,000 per 100,000 soldier a year - what's the point of continuing the bloodshed? Some of the British press also supported a British exit from Palestine. During the martial conditions imposed by the British, the Lehi and the Irgun carried out 68 operations, many against military targets, including ''Camp Schneller'' in Jerusalem, by breaking through the outer fortifications. This attack, which succeeded in overcoming the manifold British security measures, created an media uproar, and the curfew was canceled four days later.

On [[April 16]] [[1947]] Dov Gruner, Yehiel Drezner, Eliezer Kashani, and Mordechai El'kachi were hanged, while singing [[Hatikvah]]. On [[April 21]] [[Meir Feinstein]] and Lehi member [[Moshe Barazani]] blew themselves up, using a hand grenade, hours before their scheduled hanging. And on [[May 4]] one of the Irgun's largest operations took place - the raid of the prison in the citadel in [[Acre]]. The operation was carried out by 23 men, along with the help of the Irgun and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] prisoners inside the prison. The raid allowed 41 underground members to escape, although some were caught outside of the prison, and some were killed in the escape. Along with the underground movement members, many Arab criminals also escaped. The operation resonated all over the world. Three of the attackers - Meir Nakar, Avshalom Haviv, and Yaakov Weiss - were caught and sentenced to death.

After the three's death sentence was final the Irgun tried to save them by kidnapping [[hostage]]s - two British sergeants, in the streets of [[Netanya]]. British forces closed off and combed the area in search of the two, but did not find them. On [[July 29]] [[1947]] in the afternoon Meir Nakar, Avshalom Haviv, and Yaakov Weiss were hanged. Approximately thirteen hours later the sergeants' death sentence was read before them, and Sergeants Mervyn Paice and Clifford Martin were hanged in a forest south of Netanya. This action caused a great in Britain and was condemned both there and by leaders of the Yishuv. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887512,00.html Eye for an Eye for an Eye, Time Magazine.

This episode, along with the [[King David Hotel bombing]], and the beating of the British officers is thought to be one of the deciding factors in the British final choice to leave Palestine. The [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)]] was also influenced by these actions. At the same time another incident was developing - the events of the ship [[Exodus]]. The 4,500 Holocaust survivors on board were not allowed to enter Palestine. UNSCOP also covered the events. Some of its members were even present at Haifa port when the emigrants were forcefully removed from their ship onto the deportation ships, and later commented that this strong image helped them press for an immediate solution for Jewish immigration and the question of Palestine.

Two weeks later, the British House of Commons convened for a special to discuss the events in Palestine, and concluded that the British soldiers must be evacuated as soon as possible.

===War of Independence===
{{main|1948 Arab-Israeli War}}
UNSCOP's conclusion was a unanimous decision to end the British mandate and majority opinion to divide the area west of the [[Jordan River]] between a Jewish state and an Arab state. During the UN's deliberations regarding the committee's recommendations the Irgun avoided initiating any attacks, so as not to influence the UN negatively on the idea of a Jewish state. On [[November 29]] the [[UN General Assembly]] voted in favor of ending the mandate and [[1947 UN Partition Plan|establishing two states]] on the land. That very same day the Irgun and the Lehi renewed their attacks on British targets. Then next day the local Arabs began attacking the Jewish community, thus beginning the first stage of the [[Israeli War of Independence]]. The first attacks on Jews were in Jewish neighborhoods of [[Jerusalem]], in and around [[Jaffa]], [[Bat Yam]], [[Holon]], and Ha'Tikvah neighborhood in [[Tel Aviv]].

In the autumn of 1947 the Irgun membership was approximately 4,000 people. The goal of the organization at that point was the conquest of the land between the Jordan River and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] for the sake of the future Jewish state and preventing the [[Arab Legion]] from destroying the Jewish community. The Irgun became a nearly entirely above ground organization, and established military bases in [[Ramat Gan]] and [[Petach Tikvah]]. Additionally, it recruited openly thus significantly increasing in size. During the war the Irgun fought alongside the Lehi and the Haganah in the front against the Arab attacks. At first the Haganah maintained a defensive policy, as it had until then, but after the [[Convoy of 35]] incident it completely abandoned its policy of restraint: "Distinguishing between individuals is longer possible, for now - it is a war, and the even the innocent shall not be absolved."<ref>Netanel Lorech, Events of the War of Independence, Massada Publishing, 1958. pp. 85 {{he icon}}</ref>

The Irgun also began carrying out reprisal missions, as it had under [[David Raziel|Raziel's]] command. At the same time though, it published announcements calling on the Arabs to lay down their weapons and maintain a ceasefire:
:''"The National Military Organization has warned you, if the murderous attacks on Jewish civilians shall continue, its soldiers will penetrate your centers of activity and plague you. You have not heeded the warning. You continued to harm our brothers and murder them in wild cruelty. Therefore soldiers of the National Military Organization will go on the attack, as we have warned you.''

:''...However even in these frenzied time, when Arab and Jewish blood is spilled at the British enslaver, we hereby call upon you... to stop the attacks and create peace between us. We do not want a war with you. We are certain that neither do you want a war with us..."'' <ref>[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/ezrachut/begin/47_20-2.htm Petition of Our Arab Neighbors: Announcement in Arabic to the Arab Rioters {{he icon}}]</ref>

However the mutual attacks continued. The Irgun attacked the Arab villages of [[Tira]] near [[Haifa]], Yehudiya ('Abassiya) in the center, and [[Shuafat]] by Jerusalem. In Jerusalem Irgun members dropped an explosive device into a large group of unarmed Arabs who were waiting for a bus by [[Jaffa Gate]] in Jerusalem, killing many. The Irgun also attacked in the Wadi Rushmiya neighborhood in Haifa and Abu Kabir in [[Jaffa]]. On [[December 29]] Irgun units arrived by boat to the Jaffa shore and a gunfight between them and Arab gangs ensued. The [[December 30|following day]] seven Arabs were killed, and dozens injured, near the refineries in Haifa. In response, Arabs workers [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre|attacked Jews in the area]], killing 41. This sparked a Haganah response in [[Balad al-Shaykh raid|Balad al-Sheykh]]. The Irgun's goal in the fighting was to move the battles from Jewish populated areas to Arab populated areas. On [[January 1]] [[1948]] the Irgun attacked again in Jaffa, its men entering the city dressed as British; later in the month it attacked in [[Beit Nabala]], a base for many Arab fighters. 

In February the Irgun attacked traffic near Yehudiya ('Abassiya), Yazur, and [[Ramle]]. Irgun fighters participated in fights against Arab militants in Ramle and [[Qalqilyah]]. In March the Irgun attacked the village of Qaqun (near [[Tulkarem]]), which had many Arab militants among its residents. Such was also [[Deir Yassin]], west of Jerusalem, a village that was a mid-point for Arab forces moving towards the village of [[Al-Qastal]], and was also a starting point for Arab militants in raids against Jews in the western neighborhoods of Jerusalem. On [[April 9]] approximately 120 Irgun and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] members began an operation to capture the village. The battle that ensued
got out of hand, resulting in five Irgun members dead and 40 injured. Regarding casualties on the Arab side, approximately 100 were killed, reports of a [[Deir Yassin massacre|massacre]] spread, and to this day there is great controversy regarding the accurate events of that day. Some also say that this incident was an event that accelerated the Arab exodus from Palestine.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/israel_at_50/profiles/81305.stm</ref>Four days later, on April 13, the Arabs launched a strike on a medical convoy traveling to [[Hadassah medical convoy massacre|Hadassah Hospital]]. Around 77 doctors, nurses, and other Jewish civilians were massacred.

The Irgun cooperated with the [[Haganah]] in the conquest of [[Haifa]]. At the regional commander's request, on [[April 21]] the Irgun took over an Arab post above Hadar Ha'Carmel as well as the Arab neighborhood of Wadi Nisnas, adjacent to the Lower City.

The Irgun acted independently in the conquest of [[Jaffa]] (an Arab city according to the U.N. partition plan). On [[April 25]] Irgun units, about 600 strong, left the Irgun base in [[Ramat Gan]] towards Arab Jaffa. Difficult battles ensued, and the Irgun faced resistance from the Arabs as well as the British.<ref>http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac18.htm</ref> Under Amichai "Gidi" Faglin's command, the Irgun's chief operations officer, the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya, which threatened the city of [[Tel Aviv]]. Afterwards the force continued to the sea, towards the area of the port, and using mortars, shelled the southern neighborhoods. These actions caused many Arab residents to flee the city, and 30 Irgun members were killed in the flight. The British demanded the evacuation of the newly conquered city, however the Irgun had previously agreed with the Haganah that British pressure would not lead to withdrawal from Jaffa and that custody of captured areas would be turned over to the Haganah. The city ultimately fell on [[May 13]] after Haganah forces entered the city and took control of the rest of the city, from the south - part of the ''Hametz Operation'' which included the conquest of a number of villages in the area. The battles in Jaffa were a great victory for the Irgun. This operation was the largest in the history of the organization, which took place in highly built up area that had many militants in shooting positions. During the battles explosives were used in order to break into homes and continue forging a way though them. Furthermore, this was the first occasion in which the Irgun had directly fought British forces, reinforced with armor and heavy weaponry. The city began these battles with a population estimated at 55,000, which shrank to some 4,100 Arab residents by the end of major hostilities. Since the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya on its own, causing the flight of many of Jaffa's residents, the Irgun took credit for the conquest of Jaffa.

===Additional information===

While the strategy, tactics, and operational methods of the organization changed through the years, its primary goals were to:

* Provide a non-Socialist alternative to the leading Zionist organizations;
* Eliminate or reduce the threat of Arab attacks on Jewish targets by assured and harsh retaliation for such attacks;
* Bring to an end the British mandatory rule

The group went through several phases in its short lifespan, not listed above:

* In 1948, the group was formally dissolved and its members integrated into the newly formed [[Israeli Defense Forces]]. This integration largely coincided with the sinking of the [[Altalena Affair|Altalena]], a ship with fighters Irgun had recruited and arms Irgun had acquired for the Israeli forces.

== Views about Irgun ==

Views about the Irgun have been as disparate as any other political topic in Israel society.  Leaders within the mainstream [[Jewish Agency]], [[Haganah]], [[Histadrut]], as well as British authorities, routinely condemned (publicly at least; privately the Haganah kept a dialogue with the dissident groups) Irgun operations as [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and branded it an illegal organization<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/72/a5211172.shtml ww2peopleswar]</ref> as a result of the group's attacks on [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|civilian targets]].
