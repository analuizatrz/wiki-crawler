'''Dubstep''' is a genre of music which has its roots in the [[UK garage]] scene in London in the early [[2000s]]. The first reference to dubstep in the UK national press as a genre, or sub-genre came early in 2004. [[The Independent on Sunday]] commented on a 'whole new sound', that it said was being called by five names: ''"The music that's emerging is so new, inventive and atomised, it doesn't have one name but five. 'Eightbar', 'sublow', 'dubstep', 'eski' and, most prominently, 'grime', are all being touted as descriptors of a uniquely British music that descends from the garage sound that launched [[Ms. Dynamite]], [[Mis-Teeq]] and [[So Solid Crew]]."''<ref name="IOS">{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2004-02-22]] |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040222/ai_n12752133 |last=Braddock |first=Kevin |title = Partners in Grime}}</ref>  By April 2005, the Dubstep club night ''Forward>>'' was being listed in the national press.<ref name="times-forward">{{cite news |work=[[The Times]] |date=[[2005-04-09]] |title=Forward; Hit or Hype |first=Alex |last = MacPherson }}</ref>

In late 2005 and early 2006, dubstep as a genre steadily became more notable, and expanded beyond small, provincial scenes thanks to coverage in [[music magazine]]s such as ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', as well as [[the internet]]. Interest in dubstep grew after [[BBC Radio 1]] [[Disk jockey#Radio disk jockeys|DJ]] [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] championed the genre, devoting a show to the genre entitled "Dubstep Warz" in January 2006<ref name="teleg"/><ref name="Time1">{{cite web | author= O'Connell, Sharon | title=  Dubstep | work=  [[Time Out London]] | url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2083/3.html | date= [[4 October]] [[2006]] | |accessmonthday=[[21 June]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref><ref name="Pitch1">{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39704-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= [[16 November]] [[2006]] | |accessmonthday=[[21 June]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref>, and later releasing [[Warrior Dubz]], a [[compilation album]]. By October 2006, the genre was notable enough to be covered by the [[Daily Telegraph]]; it described dubstep as ''"the latest development in British dance music... yet another sound stemming from London's garage scene, a bass-heavy instrumental form rather confusingly known as Dubstep."''<ref name="teleg"/>. 


==Characteristics==
Dubstep was originally a genre influenced largely by the [[South London]]-based [[UK garage#2-step|2-step]], itself a variant of UK Garage<ref name="teleg">{{cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=[[2006-10-14]] |last = de Wilde |first=Gervase |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/10/14/bmdubstep14.xml |title=Put a bit of dub in your step: a new form of dance music from Croydon is ready to conquer the world}}</ref>  as well as [[dub reggae]];<ref name="plasticman">{{cite web|title= Interview: Plasticman|work= Riddim.ca |url=http://www.riddim.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=49&Itemid=39 |author=Pearsall |date=[[2005-06-18]]}}</ref>. Like another, more vocal garage hybrid, [[grime]], the genre typically uses dark, [[minor key]] sounds, but the major distinguishing elements of dubstep are an almost omnipresent [[subbass]], use of [[sample (music)|samples]], the fact it is largely [[instrumental music|instrumental]], and a characteristic propulsive, sparse rhythm.

===The Dubstep Rhythm===

[[Image:Dubsamplescore.jpg|thumb|center|Musical score of the above recording (click to enlarge)]]
{{sample box end}}The origins of the archetypal dubstep drum pattern are varied, encapsulating elements of all the above genres. Dubstep rhythms are usually [[syncopation|syncopated]], and often [[swung note|shuffled]] or incorporating [[tuplet|triplets]]. The tempo is nearly always in the range of 138-142[[beats per minute|bpm]].<ref name="cbc">[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/dub_style.html "South London calling" from CBC.ca website] Matthew McKinnon, January 30 2007</ref> 

Dubstep rhythms typically do not follow a [[four-to-the-floor]] pattern similar to many other styles of electronic dance music, but instead tend to miss out beats and repeat sets of two bars rather than single bars. Often, the rhythm will follow a pattern which when played alone will appear to be playing at half the tempo of the track, but the double-time feel is achieved by other elements, usually the bassline.

==History==
===Origins of the sound: 1999-2002===
The sound originally came out of productions by [[El-B]]<ref name="wire279">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/current/index.php |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |issue=279 |title=The Primer: Dubstep}}</ref> (as part of both Groove Chronicles with Noodles and then the Ghost camp), [[Horsepower Productions]]<ref name="wire279" />, [[Oris Jay]]<ref name="Res1">http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature-read.aspx?id=822</ref>, [[Steve Gurley]]<ref name="wire279" />(who all feature on [[Tempa]]'s ''Roots of Dubstep'' compilation) and [[Zed Bias]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}} in [[1999]]-[[2000]].

The term 'dubstep' was coined by Forward>>, a club run by [[Ammunition Promotions]]<ref name="wire279" /><ref name="cyclic">http://www.cyclicdefrost.com/article.php?article=93</ref> and first used on an [[XLR8R]] magazine cover that featured [[Horsepower Productions]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. It gained full acceptance with the Dubstep Allstars Vol 1 CD ([[Tempa]]) mixed by DJ [[Hatcha]]. Since [[2001]], Ammunition have been responsible for a raft of labels such as Tempa, Soulja, Road, Vehicle, Shelflife, Texture, Stealth People, Bingo and more - though to date only Soulja, Bingo, Road and Tempa remain active.[[Image:MixingRecords-Croydon.jpg|thumb|right|The Mixing Records record shop, formerly Big Apple Records, in Croydon]]

''Forward>>'' was originally held at the Velvet Rooms in London's [[Soho]] and now running every Friday at Plastic People in [[Shoreditch]], [[East London, England|east London]].<ref name="cbc">.</ref> Founded in 2001, this club was critical in the development of dubstep, providing the first venue devoted to the sound and an environment in which producers could premier new music. Forward>> also ran a radio show on east London pirate station [[Rinse FM]], hosted by producer/DJ [[Kode9]], owner of the pioneering [[Hyperdub]] label. The original ''Forward>>'' residents included Hatcha, Youngsta, Kode9, Zed Bias, Oris Jay, [[Slaughter Mob]], Jay Da Flex, [[Slimzee]] and others, plus regular guests. The line up of residents has changed over the years to now include Youngsta, Hatcha, Geeneus and [[Plastician]], with Crazy D as MC/host. Producers including D1, [[Skream]] and [[Benga (artist)|Benga]] make regular appearances.

Another crucial element in the development of dubstep was the [[Big Apple Records]] [[record shop]] in [[Croydon]] (now [[Mixing Records]]). Key artists such as [[Hatcha]], and later [[Skream]] worked in the shop (which initially sold [[UK garage|garage]] and [[drum and bass]], but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area) <ref name="wire279" />, whilst [[Digital Mystikz]] were frequent visitors.  El-B, Zed Bias, Horsepower, and a young Loefah regularly visited the shop as well.<ref name="Time1" />

===Origins of the scene: 2003-2005===
Throughout [[2003]] on Rinse FM and through his sets at ''Forward>>'', DJ Hatcha began pioneering a new direction for dubstep, one that was to finally establish the scene as a new sound. Playing sets cut to 10" one-off reggae-style [[dubplate]]s, he drew exclusively from a pool of new South London producers - first [[Benga (artist)|Benga]] and [[Skream]], then also [[Digital Mystikz]] and [[Loefah]] - to pioneer a dark, clipped and minimal new direction in dubstep. The addition of Digital Mystikz to Hatcha sets brought with them an expanded palate of sounds and influences, most prominently reggae and dub, but also strange mystical melodies.
[[Image:Skream1.jpg|thumb|right|Skream]]
Another key turning point for the scene was the two misnamed 'Grime' compilations put together by  [[Rephlex]] in 2004 (assisted by Ammunition). Featuring Plasticman, Mark One and Slaughter Mob on the first volume, and Kode 9, Loefah and Digital Mystikz on the second, it introduced the different flavours to the global [[electronic music]] audience, the repercussions of which can be seen in current productions and club nights. 

The south London collective [[Digital Mystikz]] (Mala and Coki) and Loefah soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, [[dub music|dub]] values, and appreciation of [[Drum n bass|jungle]] bass weight to the dubstep scene - and with it a new lease on life. After 12"s on Big Apple, they began [[DMZ Records|DMZ]] label, which has released eleven 12"s to date. They also began their night DMZ, held every two months in Brixton, a part of London steeped in [[reggae]] history. DMZ has showcased new dubstep talent such as Skream, Kode 9, Benga, Pinch, DJ Youngsta, Hijak, JoeNice and [[Vex'd]]. The evening that queues at DMZ exceeded the capacity of the venue, prompting a move to a larger capacity venue upstairs has been called a pivotal point in the popularity of dubstep by [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] magazine {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Dubstep nights possessing [[sound systems]] of comparable power to DMZ include Subloaded, [[Bristol]]'s dubstep night promoted by DJ Pinch and the Context crew, along with the monthly SubDub/Exodus night at the [[Leeds West Indian Centre]] on the [[Iration Steppas]] Sound System.

Around this time, ''Forward>>'' were also incubating several other strains of dark garage hybrids, so much so that in the early days of the club the coming together of the three strains was referred to as the "''Forward>>'' sound". One style of early grime, then called '8bar', was played here by DJs like Slimzee (then of Pay As U Go, now part of Rinse FM). This style allowed producers like Croydon's Plasticman (now known as [[Plastician]]) and Manchester's Mark One to come through with their own takes on the grime sound. Breakbeat garage ( a darker, breakier sound, see below) was pioneered here. The summer of 2005 saw ''Forward>>'' bring grime DJs to the fore of the line up with [[Roll Deep]], [[Jammer (rapper)|Jammer]], Geeneus, Newham Generals performing with their respective MCs. 

''Forward>>'' also attracted the attention of Rinse FM DJs, who around 2003 opened up their schedule to dubstep DJs during a time when the traditional garage scene had turned its back on the sound. Rinse FM strengthened the connection between dubstep and its urban London surroundings, while also allowing the scene to incubate new ideas.

===Growth of the scene: 2006-present===

[[2006 in music|2006]] saw interest grow in the sound. Building on the success of [[Skream]]'s [[2005 in music|2005]] grimey anthem 'Midnight Request Line,' the hype around the DMZ night and support from online forums and bloggers, the scene gained prominence after [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] gathered the cream of the scene together for one show, entitled 'Dubstep Warz', (later releasing the [[compilation album]] '[[Warrior Dubz]]'). The effect was to create a massive new audience for the scene, both in the UK and worldwide, after years of underground hard graft.<ref name="cbc">.</ref> A successful year for the genre culminated in [[Burial (musician)|Burial]]'s self-titled album appearing in many critics' "Best of..." lists for the year, notably [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire Magazine]]'s Best Album of 2006. Ammunition also released the first retrospective compilation of the 2000-2004 era of dubstep called "The Roots of Dubstep," co-compiled by Ammunition and Blackdown on the [[Tempa]] Label.[[Image:Mala(dmystikz).jpg|thumb|right|Mala of Digital Mystikz]]

In [[2006 in Music|2006]] dubstep producers are increasingly absorbing [[dub]] [[reggae]] sonic aesthetics - sub bass, reverb and delay - to forge a distinct path away from associate genres like drum & bass, house and breaks. Using different rhythmic patterns like the 2-step and halfstep beat patterns (yet deployed in the same tempo range) dubstep can create senses of differing momentum within the same DJ set. At best, [[dub]] [[reggae]] sonic aesthetics also allow a broad range of new musical influences to be introduced.

Dubstep has been recently receiving substantial international attention, with the help of ambassadors such as Baltimore DJ [[Joe Nice]] and [[Matt Carl]] from Canada.<ref name="cbc">.</ref>  Mary Anne Hobbs curated a Dubstep showcase at 2007's [[Sónar]] festival in Barcelona.<ref name="RA101">Sande, Kiran. [http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature-read.aspx?id=822 "Dubstep 101"]. [[Resident Advisor]]. June 7, 2007</ref> 

[[Digital Mystikz]], Random Trio and [[Kode 9]] were all featured on the soundtrack for the [[2006 in Music|2006]] sci-fi film [[Children of Men]].

Techno artists and DJs are now assimilating dubstep into their sets and productions.<ref name="RA101" /> Renowned wonky [[techno]] [[Record producer|producer]] [[Neil Landstrumm]] is currently touring his 'Ravestep' set, and [[minimal techno]] DJ/producer [[Ricardo Villalobos]] has produced a (typically long and slowly evolving) remix of [[Shackleton (musician)|Shackleton]]'s ''Blood on my hands''.<ref name="RA101" />
