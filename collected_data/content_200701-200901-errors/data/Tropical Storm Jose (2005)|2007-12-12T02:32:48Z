'''Tropical Storm Jose''' was a short-lived [[tropical storm]] which made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in central [[Mexico]] during August 2005. Jose was the tenth named storm of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] and the fourth of six [[tropical cyclones]] (three hurricanes and three tropical storms) to make landfall in Mexico in that year.

Tropical Storm Jose formed in the [[Bay of Campeche]] on [[August 22]] and made landfall in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]] the next day. It retained tropical characteristics for less than one day before dissipating, but still brought heavy levels of rainfall to the region. Mudslides caused by the rainfall killed eight people, six of those directly, and caused $45 million (2005 [[US dollars|USD]]) in damage.<ref name="Mexican Damages">{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Teorema Ambiental|title=Estiman daños en Veracruz por 500 millones de pesos |accessdate=May 24|accessyear=2006|language=Spanish|url=http://www.teorema.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=44&id_art=184}}</ref> <!--The source gives total in Mexican pesos-->

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Jose 2005 track.png}}
On [[August 17]] a [[tropical wave]], probably the same wave from which [[List of storms in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Depression Ten|Tropical Depression Ten]] had developed from earlier in the month, began to [[tropical cyclogenesis|organize]] in the central [[Caribbean]]. [[Atmospheric convection|Convection]] gradually increased as it moved towards the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], but the system did not develop beyond a tropical wave. The system weakened as it crossed the peninsula, and when it entered the [[Bay of Campeche]] on [[August 21]] it had hardly any convection remaining. However, early in the morning of [[August 22]], convection rapidly increased under highly favorable upper-level conditions, and the system became Tropical Depression Eleven about 110&nbsp;miles (175&nbsp;km) east of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]].<ref name="JoseTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Jose|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 22|accessyear=2006|format=PDF|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL112005_Jose.pdf}}</ref>

The depression rapidly intensified as it moved to the west, becoming Tropical Storm Jose just six hours later. The [[Tropical cyclone forecast model|global model guidance]] initially failed to resolve the storm's track well, with some models indicating that it would stall offshore.<ref name="NHC-disc2">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Depression Eleven, 5 p.m. EDT, August 22 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 22|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al112005.discus.002.shtml}}</ref> Jose continued to strengthen as it moved towards the coast and made landfall in the state of [[Veracruz]] early on [[August 23]] with winds reaching a peak of 60&nbsp;mph (90&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="JoseTCR"/> As Jose made its landfall an [[eyewall|eye]] was beginning to form, although the storm was still well short of [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 1|hurricane intensity]].<ref name="NHC-disc5">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Jose, 5 a.m. EDT, August 23 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 22|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al112005.discus.005.shtml}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Jose quickly weakened after [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] and dissipated that afternoon in the mountains of central Mexico only 24&nbsp;hours after forming.<ref name="JoseTCR"/>

==Preparations==
As Tropical Storm Jose formed so close to shore there was a lead time of less than 9 hours on the [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] for the [[Veracruz]] coastline. The area covered by the warning issued on [[September 22]] was extended southwards as Jose intensified, before being canceled soon after landfall on [[September 23]]. The advisories issued by the [[National Hurricane Center]] emphasized that rainfall from Jose was the primary threat.<ref name="JoseTCR"/>

Tropical Storm Jose was responsible for damaging [[Crop (agriculture)|crops]], [[highways]] and [[homes]]; flooding districts in several cities in the state of [[Veracruz]], and the evacuation of 80,000&nbsp;people to [[shelters]]. The government of that state estimated the damages caused by the storm to be approximately $45&nbsp;million (2005 [[US dollars|USD]]). Approximately 120&nbsp;municipalities were affected by the torrential rain, but the majority of the damage was concentrated to eight of them: [[Martínez de la Torre]], [[Misantla]], [[Nautla]], [[San Rafael]], [[Vega de la Torre]], [[Actopan, Veracruz|Actopan]], [[Cardel]] and [[Úrsulo Galván]]. Damage to the highway infrastructure was estimated at $33 million (2005 USD).<ref name="Mexican Damages"/>

It was also reported that the storm damaged at least 16,000&nbsp;homes and about 250&nbsp;[[square kilometer]]s (60&nbsp;thousand [[acres]]) of land used for [[cattle]]. In addition over 420&nbsp;square kilometers (103 thousand acres) of various crops, including [[sugar]] cane, [[corn]] and [[banana]]s, were flooded. Many boats were also lost as a result of Jose. 90&nbsp;active medical brigades were sent to the region to reduce the risk of [[infection]]s amongst the affected population.<ref name="Mexican Damages"/>

Jose was responsible for six direct casualties. One of these deaths was the result of a mud slide that killed a man was in [[Xalapa, Veracruz]]. The other five deaths were also due to mudslides in [[Oaxaca]].<ref name="JoseTCR"/>

==Naming and records==
When Tropical Storm Jose formed on [[August 22]], it was the earliest date for the formation of the tenth tropical storm in an Atlantic hurricane season, beating the previous record held by Tropical Storm Jerry of the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]] by 1 day. This was also the third time the name "Jose" had been used to name a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic. As Tropical Storm Jose did not have a major impact, the name was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season.
