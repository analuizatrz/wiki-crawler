'''''Amanita phalloides''''', also known as the '''death cap''', is one of numerous species of [[mushroom]]s in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. It has an infamous reputation for being one of the most toxic of all fungi, and responsible for the majority of deaths from mushroom poisoning.<ref name ="benjamin95">{{cite journal |author=Benjamin DR |title=Amatoxin syndrome |pages=198–214}} in: {{cite book |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas — a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians |publisher=New York: WH Freeman and Company |year=1995}}</ref> Its dangerousness is heightened by its similarity to some widely eaten species. Its [[scientific name]] ''phalloides'' means [[phallus]]-shaped.

Its principal toxic constituent is [[alpha-amanitin]], which damages the liver and kidneys, often fatally. The other main agent identified, [[phalloidin]], is now not thought to be active in poisoning but proving fruitful in biochemical research.

Widely distributed across the [[Europe]], the death cap has been accidentally introduced into [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[North America]].

==Description and classification==
The death cap has a large and distinctive [[fungus|fungal]] fruiting body or [[Fruiting body|basidiocarp]], usually with a [[pileus]] (cap) from 5 to 15&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (2–6&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) across, initially rounded and hemispherical but flattening with age. Easily peeled, the cap surface can be olive green or brown with a green to smooth yellow tinge, and is often paler after rain. There is a partial veil, white fine [[lamella]]e (gills), and a white 4 to 18&nbsp;cm long and 1 to 3&nbsp;cm-thick [[stipe]] with an [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]] and a swollen volva (base), and jagged edges which stand out from the stalk. As the volva, which may be hidden by leaf litter, is a distinctive and diagnostic feature it is important to remove some debris to check for one.<ref>{{cite book | author = Jordan P, Wheeler S. | year = 2001 | title = The Ultimate Mushroom Book | publisher = London: Hermes House}}</ref> Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg, covered by a universal veil, which then breaks leaving the volva as a remnant. Like other ''Amanita'', the spore print is white.

''Amanita phalloides'' is the [[type species]] of ''Amanita'' section ''Phalloideae'', a group that contains all of the deadly [[amatoxin]]-containing ''Amanita'' species, including the [[destroying angels]]. 

Other similar species include ''A. subjunquillea'' in eastern [[Asia]] and ''A. arocheae'' with a range extending from Andean [[Colombia]] to central [[Mexico]] (at least). All these fungi are [[mycorrhizal]].

===Similarity to edible species===
[[Asia]]n immigrants in North America, Europe, and Australia have often mistaken the death cap for the [[edible mushroom|edible]] [[paddy straw mushroom]] (''[[Volvariella volvacea]]'')<ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Trim GM, ''et. al.'' |year=1999 |title=Poisoning by ''Amanita phalloides'' ("deathcap") mushrooms in the Australian Capital Territory |journal=[[Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume=171 |pages=247–249}}</ref> or the edible Asian "false death caps" (such as ''[http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/mangchiu.html Amanita manginiana]'') {{Fact|date=February 2007}} due to their similarity in appearance. This is a leading cause of mushroom poisoning in the [[United States]]. Novices may also mistake death caps for other edible ''Amanita'' species such as ''[[Amanita lanei]]'', and for this reason, some authorities recommend avoiding all ''Amanita'' species for the table.<ref>Kuo M. (2005). [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita.html "The Genus Amanita"]. ''MushroomExpert.com''.</ref> Because of its resemblance to edible mushrooms, it is considered especially dangerous; the Finnish name ''kavalakärpässieni'' ("devious [[Amanita muscaria|fly mushroom]]") is very apt.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Distribution and habitat==
The death cap is found primarily and originally in [[Europe]] but now is also in [[North America]], southeastern [[Australia]],<ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Reid DA. |year=1980 |title=A monograph of the Australian species of ''Amanita'' Pers. ex Hook (Fungi) |journal=[[Australian Journal of Botany]] Supplementary Series|volume=8 |pages=1–96}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Cole FM. |year=1993 |title=''Amanita phalloides'' in Victoria |journal=Medical Journal of Australia |volume=158 |pages=849–850}}</ref> [[South America]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].  ''Amanita phalloides'' appears to be spreading worldwide, and has been conveyed to new countries with the importation of exotic hardwoods and conifers. In the early decades of the 20th century, Charles Horton Peck had identified ''A. phalloides'' in North America. However in 1918, these were re-identified as the similar ''[[Amanita brunnescens]]'' by G. F. Atkinson of [[Cornell University]].<ref name = "Litten75">{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Litten W. |year=1975 |title=The most poisonous mushrooms |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=232 |issue=3 |pages=90–101}}</ref> However in the last thirty years it has become clear that ''A. phalloides'' does occur in the United States and appears to have been introduced from [[Europe]], with populations on the west and east coast.

It is [[ectomycorrhizally]] associated with a number of tree species. In Europe, it can associate with a large number of [[hardwood]] and [[conifer]] species, including [[oak]], [[beech]], [[chestnut]], [[Aesculus|horse-chestnut]], [[birch]], [[filbert]], [[hornbeam]], [[pine]], and [[spruce]].<ref name=tulloss>Tulloss RE. (2006). [http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/phalloid.html ''Amanita phalloides''  (Fr.:Fr.) Link] (webpage).</ref> In other areas, ''A. phalloides'' may also be associated with these trees, or may be associated with some of these trees, but not others. In coastal California, for example, ''A. phalloides'' is associated with [[coast live oak]], but not the various coastal pine species, such as [[Monterey pine]].<ref>Arora D. (1986). ''Mushrooms demystified''. Berkeley, CA: Ten Speed Press.</ref> ''A. phalloides'' may also be associated with [[Tsuga|hemlock]], ''[[Eucalyptus]]'', or ''[[Leptospermum]]'' in areas where those trees occur.<ref name=tulloss> </ref>

==Toxicity==
[[Image:Death Cap Mushroom.jpg|thumb|left|Warning sign in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].]]
Death caps have been reported to taste pleasant.<ref name="Clel76">{{cite book | author= Cleland JB. | year =1976| title = Toadstools and mushrooms and other larger fungi of South Australia | publisher = South Australian Government Printer |pages = 326}}</ref><ref name = "Litten75"/> This, coupled with the delay in symptoms is particularly dangerous. These do not occur for eight to twelve hours, sometimes 24 hours, during which time irreparable damage may be occurring. Initially, symptoms are [[gastrointestinal]] in nature and include [[Biliary colic|colicky]] abdominal pain, watery [[diarrhea]], and [[vomiting]], which may lead to [[dehydration]]. These resolve two to three days post ingestion before a more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement - [[jaundice]], diarrhea, [[delirium]], [[seizures]] and [[coma]] due to [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and [[liver failure]] may supervene.<ref>{{cite book | author = North P.| year = 1967 | title = Poisonous plants and fungi in colour | publisher = London: Blandford Press & Pharmacological Society of Great Britain }}</ref> [[Renal failure]] is often present but does not generally occur until after the liver involvement.  Death generally occurs about seven to ten days post ingestion. Up to the mid-20th century, the mortality rate was around sixty to seventy percent, but this has greatly improved with advances in medical care to around ten to fifteen percent.<ref name ="benjamin95"/>

As the common name suggests, it is highly poisonous, and is responsible for the majority of fatal [[mushroom poisoning]]s worldwide. It is estimated that 30&nbsp;[[gram]]s (half of a cap) of this mushroom is enough to kill a human.<ref name ="benjamin95">{{cite journal |author=Benjamin DR |title=Amatoxin syndrome |pages=198–214}} in: {{cite book |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas — a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians |publisher=New York: WH Freeman and Company |year=1995}}</ref> Not surprisingly, it has been the subject of intensive research into its biochemistry for many decades.<ref name = "Litten75"/>

It is now known to contain two types of toxins, both bicyclic, or two-ringed, [[peptide]]s,  spread throughout the mushroom [[Thallus (tissue)|thallus]]: the [[amatoxin]]s ([[amanitin]], [[amanin (organic compound)|amanin]], [[amanullin]]) and the [[phallotoxin]]s ([[phalloidin]], [[phalloin]], [[phallisin]], [[phallicidin]]). 
 
The amatoxins consist of at least five compounds with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings. Isolated in 1941 by [[Heinrich Otto Wieland|Heinrich O. Wieland]] and Rudolf Hallermayer of the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|University of Munich]],<ref name = "Litten75"/> [[alpha-amanitin]] is the toxin most responsible for the deadly effects of the death cap. 

The phallotoxins consist of at six compounds with a similar structure, that of seven amino-acid rings.  Phalloidin had been isolated in 1937 by [[Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen|Feodor Lynen]], Heinrich Wieland's student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though highly toxic to liver cells ''in vitro'', it has since been found to have little input into the death cap's toxicity as it is not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, it is found in the edible and sought after [[Blusher]] (''Amanita rubescens'').<ref name = "Litten75"/>

The poison particularly affects the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Treatment is mainly supportive ([[gastric lavage]], [[activated carbon]], [[Fluid replacement|fluid resuscitation]]), though serious cases may require an [[Liver transplantation|orthotopic liver transplant]].<ref>Klein AS, ''et al.'' (1989). ''Amanita'' poisoning: treatment and the role of liver transplantation. ''[[American Journal of Medicine]]'' '''86''':187–93.</ref><ref>Pinson CW, ''et al.'' (1990). Liver transplantation for severe ''Amanita phalloides'' mushroom poisoning. ''[[American Journal of Surgery]]'' '''159''':493–9.</ref> This is a vexed issue in itself as the treatment has a significant mortality and long-term implications for the potential patient.

High dose continuous intravenous [[Penicillin#Benzylpenicillin .28penicillin G.29|penicillin G]] is of benefit though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with [[cephalosporin]] show promise.<ref name ="benjamin95"/><ref>Neftel K, ''et al.'' (1988). Are cephalosporins more active than penicillin G in poisoning with the deadly ''Amanita''? ''Schweiz Med Wochenschr''. '''118'''(2):49–51. </ref>

There is some evidence that intravenous [[silibinin]], an extract from the [[blessed milk thistle]] (''Silybum marianum''), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of deathcap poisoning by offering protection to undamaged hepatic tissue.<ref>Carducci R, ''et al.'' (1996). Silibinin and acute poisoning with ''Amanita phalloides'' ''Minerva Anestesiologia'' '''62'''(5):187–93 (''in Italian'') ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=8937042&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum abstract])</ref>

Though survival rates have improved, there is increasing evidence that up to half of those who do recover show signs of permanent liver damage.<ref name ="benjamin95">{{cite journal |author=Benjamin DR |title=Amatoxin syndrome |pages=198–214}} in: {{cite book |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas — a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians |publisher=New York: WH Freeman and Company |year=1995}}</ref>

==Notable victims==
It has been speculated that the early demise of several historical figures was caused by poisonings by ''Amanita phalloides'' or [[destroying angel]] amanitas, either accidentally or as an [[assassination]] by poisoning. Alleged victims of this kind of poisoning include the Roman Emperor [[Claudius]], [[Pope Clement VII]], Tsaritsa [[Natalia Naryshkina]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]].<ref name=wasson>Wasson RG. (1972). The death of Claudius, or mushrooms for murderers. ''Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University'' '''23'''(3):101–128.</ref>

[[R. Gordon Wasson]] <ref name=wasson> </ref> recounted the details of these deaths, noting whether they were likely to have been cased by ''Amanita'' poisoning or not. In the case of Clement VII, the illness that lead to his death lasted some five months, clearly inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning. Natalia Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms near the time of her death, however, it is unclear whether the mushrooms themselves were poisonous or whether she simply succumbed to [[food poisoning]].

Charles VI became ill with indigestion after eating a dish of sauteed mushrooms, leading to an illness from which he died ten days later; symptomology that is consistent with amatoxin poisoning. Charles' death lead to the [[War of Austrian Succession]], leading [[Voltaire]] to note, "a pot of mushrooms changed the history of Europe."

The case of the death of Claudius is more complex. It is known that Claudius was very fond of ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'' and many later sources have attributed his death to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. However, ancient authors such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]] are unanimous about the fact that poison was added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish being prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculates that the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of [[colocynth]] being administered later in his illness.<ref name=wasson> </ref>
