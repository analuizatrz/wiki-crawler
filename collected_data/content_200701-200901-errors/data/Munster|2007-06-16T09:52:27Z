'''Munster''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''An Mhumhain'', {{IPA2|ənˈvuːnʲ}}) is the southernmost of the four [[provinces of Ireland]]. It comprises the counties of;
*[[County Clare|Clare]] ('''110,800''') 
*[[County Cork|Cork]],   ('''480,909''')
*[[County Kerry|Kerry]],  ('''139,616''')
*[[County Limerick|Limerick]], ('''183,863''') 
*[[County Tipperary|Tipperary]]  ('''149,050''')
*[[County Waterford|Waterford]].  ('''107,942''') 
The largest city in Munster is [[Cork (city)|Cork]].

The name is derived from the Celtic goddess, [[Muma]]. The province was once divided into six regions: Tuadh Mhuman (North Munster), Deas Mhuman (South Munster), Urh Mumhan (East Munster), Iar mumhan (West Munster), Ernaibh Muman (the Ernai tribe's portion of Munster), and Deisi Muman (the Deisi tribe's portion of Munster). Ultimately, these were all subsumed into the kingdoms of [[Thomond]] (North Munster), [[County Desmond|Desmond]] (South Munster), and [[Ormond (ancient Irish kingdom)|Ormond]] (East Munster), all of which were eventually subsumed by surrender and regrant as Earldoms in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. 
The names exist only indirectly today, particularly in the case of [[Thomond]]. The three [[crown (headgear)|crowns]] represent these three kingdoms.  This flag can easily be confused with the flag of [[Dublin]] which has three [[castle]]s in a similar pattern on a blue background; it also resembles the lesser [[coat-of-arms]] of [[Sweden]], the [[Three Crowns]].

In 1841 before the Great Famine, there were just under 3 million people living in the province of Munster, but the population had dropped devastatingly low due to mass emigration in the 1840's and continued emigration up until the 1980's.

For 30 days during the [[Irish Civil War]], the province of Munster broke away from the Irish Free State and established the [[Munster Republic]] in opposition to the acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The Munster Republic was short lived and subsequently crushed by heavily-armed [[Irish Free State]] forces.

[[Munster Rugby|Munster]] is also an [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] representative side which competes in the [[Celtic League (Rugby Union)|Celtic League]] and for the [[Heineken Cup]], winning in 2006.

==Cities==

[[Cork (city)|Cork]] is the largest city conurbation, which has a population of 190,384  (2006) and 380,000 within the Greater Cork Area.(See Cork Co. Council population report below)

Other important cities are [[Limerick]] 90,757 (2006) which also has over 100,000 people in the greater [[Limerick]] area and [[Waterford]] 49,213 (2006).

==Economy==

The province of Munster contributes 40 billion euro (US$52.57bn) to Irish GDP (25% of total Irish GDP) (2004) (greater than the [[GDP]] of Northern Ireland) (See "GDP stats" below).

The following are some of the more important employers in the region: AOL, Bausch & Lomb, Dell, Amazon, Motorola, Amgen, Pfizer, Analog Devices, Vistakon, Waterford Crystal, Apple Computer, Intel, Novartis, O2, Lufthansa Technik, Kerry Group, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Siemens, Sony. The largest employment hub in Munster is [[Metropolitan Cork]], with many large multinational firms located in the area. The second most important is the [[Shannon Free Zone]] with over 120 international firms based there employing over 7,500 people. 

The province is continuing to play an ever greater role in the bio-pharmaceutical industry and fighting off stiff competition from Switzerland and Singapore for inward investments in the bio-pharmaceutical area such as Amgen and Pfizer.
Munster is becoming increasingly important as one of Ireland's most important [[I.T.]] hubs outside of Dublin with such multinationals as Apple, Intel, Amazon and Dell locating their operations in the province.

==Irish Language==

The [[Irish language]] is spoken as a first language in [[Gaeltachtaí]] (Irish speaking areas);

* in West Kerry (''Corca Dhuibhne'')
* in South Kerry (''Uíbh Ráthach''). Here, the language died out in the 1950's.
* in West Cork (''Múscraí'')
* in south-west Cork (''Oileán Cléire'')
* in south-west Waterford (''Gaeltacht na Rinne'' or ''Gaeltacht na nDeise'')

Within the past thirty years, there has been a big increase in the amount of [[Gaelscoileanna]] (Irish language schools) outside of the [[Gaeltachtaí]]. Children learn Irish, and leave Irish, in the Gaelscoileanna. Despite being in vogue for over 30 years, these schools have failed to halt the decline of Gaelic.
