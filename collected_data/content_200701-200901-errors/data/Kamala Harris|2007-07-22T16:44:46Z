'''Kamala Devi Harris''' (born 1964 in [[Oakland, California]]) is the current [[District Attorney]] of [[San Francisco]]. She is the first woman district attorney in San Francisco, the first [[African American]] to serve as top prosecutor in [[California]], and the first [[Indian American]] to serve as district attorney in the [[United States]]. She was elected in December 2003 with over 56 percent of the votes in a run-off election against the two-term incumbent, [[Terence Hallinan]].

Harris is the daughter of an Indian American mother, [[breast cancer]] specialist Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated to the United States in 1960, and a [[Jamaican American]] father, [[Stanford University]] economics professor Donald Harris. Harris attended [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and received a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] in 1990.

A prosecutor, Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in [[Alameda County]] from 1990 to 1998. She then became the Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.  In 2000, City Attorney Louise Renne recruited her to join the City Attorney's office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division.  

In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005.  Californiaâ€™s largest legal newspaper, the Daily Journal, recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. She has served on the boards of several community organizations, and founded the Coalition to End the Exploitation of Kids (CEEK).  

In April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was gunned down in the Bayview district, Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing, a decision which triggered protests from police officers and some citizens.  Other citizens were very supportive of the decision.  Harris had made a campaign promise that she would not seek the death penalty if elected.  Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]] even threatened to intervene on behalf of the State of California to take the case out of Harris' jurisdiction.  In the end, he ruled that Harris had acted within her legal authority.
