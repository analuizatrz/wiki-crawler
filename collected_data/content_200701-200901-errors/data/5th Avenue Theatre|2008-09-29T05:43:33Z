The '''5th Avenue Theatre''' is a [[landmarks|landmark]] [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] located in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]], [[United States|USA]]. It has hosted a variety of [[theatre]] productions and [[motion pictures]] since it opened in 1926. It is operated as a venue for nationally touring [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and original shows by the [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] 5th Avenue Theatre Association. The theatre, located at 1308 Fifth Avenue in the historic [[Skinner Building]], has been listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1978.

The 2,130 seat theatre is the resident home to the 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company and employs over 600 actors, musicians, directors, choreographers, designers, technicians, stage hands, box office staff, and administrators, making it the largest theatre employer in the [[Puget Sound]] region. Unique in the region, the theatre company survives almost exclusively on gate receipts, without subsidy. 

Currently, the 5th's subscriber season programming includes 4 to 7 shows per year, a mix of national touring musicals, locally produced revivals of musical theatre classics, and premieres of bound-for-Broadway shows. The 5th Avenue Theatre has established a tradition of being a "testing ground" for new musicals before they make their debut on Broadway, launching hits such as ''[[Jekyll & Hyde (musical)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'', ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', and ''[[The Wedding Singer (musical)|The Wedding Singer]]''. The theatre also hosts a variety of special events, and offers a number of education and outreach programs to school-age children and adults reaching over 55,000 students, professional performers, and audiences each year.

[[Image:5th Ave Theater Entry (Seattle) 2007-08.jpg|thumb|right|Entry to theatre with decorative brackets above]]
Located in the Skinner Building, an historic office block ranging from five to eight stories with retail shops on the ground level, the theatre is surrounded on three sides, with its entry facing its [[namesake]] avenue. In addition to an [[auditorium]] with an original seating capacity of 3,000, the theatre contains a grand entry hall, and a [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] that once featured a [[tea room]] in addition to a [[waiting room]] and women's lounge.<ref name="Ventilation_ST_09-23-26">{{Citation |title= Opening of Fifth Avenue Theatre friday is big event: Comfort is first at new theatre |pages= p. 16 col. 5 |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |date= 1926-[[September 23|09-23]]}}</ref> 

The [[interior design]] of the 5th Avenue Theatre was modeled to reproduce some of the features of the most historic and well-known [[Beijing]] landmarks. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] artist [[Gustav Liljestrom]] executed the design based on his visit to [[China]] and the illustrated account of Ernst Boerschmann's travels there, ''Chinesische Architecktur'', published in 1925.<ref name="NRHPNomination">{{cite web |last= Seattle Office of Urban Conservation |authors= Florence K. Lentz |title= National Register of Historic Places Inventory -- Nomination Form |publisher= [[National Park Service]], [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]] |date= March 1978 |url= http://www.dahp.wa.gov/gis/pdfs/432.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2007-08-16 }}</ref>

The ornate historical [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] style of the theatre distinguishes itself from the [[Neo-Renaissance]] exterior of the Skinner Building. Only at the street entry under the [[marquee]] does the viewer get a preview of the interior design. Here, adorning the ceiling are [[plaster]] representations of wood [[bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s, [[beam (structure)|beam]]s, and carved [[relief]]s painted in a [[wikt:polychromatic|polychromatic]] scheme and decorated with stenciled dragons and flower patterns. Carved cloud shapes screen light fixtures to create an indirect lighting effect as the viewer approaches the wooden, brass knobbed entry doors. The original central free-standing [[box office]] was replaced by the current box office located to the side of the entry as part of a 1979 renovation.<ref name="NRHPNomination" /> The original [[Imperial guardian lions]] (''Ruì Shī''), commonly called foo dogs or foo lions, originally located outside the entry were moved inside as part of the 1979 renovation. 

[[Image:5th Ave Theater FooDog (Seattle) 2007-08.jpg|thumb|100px|left| Male Imperial guardian lion.]]The interior architecture of the theatre is an "excellent imitation of Chinese wooden temple construction".<ref name="NRHPNomination" /> The two story rectangular [[lobby]] features red, stenciled columns wrapped in plaster rising to a timbered roof structure of decoratively painted beams supporting a canopy of bamboo, also imitated in plaster. The original pair of guardian lions, both male, guard the [[stairway]] to a second level gallery that serves the theatre balcony. In addition to the Imperial guard lions, other original furnishings, light fixtures, and decoration remain intact.

The decorative details continue in the 2,130-seat auditorium, but the highlight and focal decorative feature is the octagonal [[Caisson (Asian architecture)|caisson]] from which a sculpted five-toed [[Imperial]] [[Chinese dragon]] springs. A large chandelier of glass hangs from the dragon's mouth, in reference to the Chinese symbol of a dragon disgorging flaming pearls.<ref name="Walters">{{cite book |last=Walters |first=Derek |title=Chinese Mythology |publisher=Diamond Books |date= 1995 |location= London |pages= 45 |isbn= 9780261666573 }}</ref> One claim puts the size of this caisson at twice the size of the model on which it was based in the throne room of the [[Hall of Supreme Harmony]] in the [[Forbidden City]].<ref name="historictheater" /> The opening night program spoke effusively of it:

[[Image:5th Ave Theater Caisson (Seattle) 2007-08.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Dragon and Pearl ceiling centerpiece.]]
{{quote|... Its most imposing feature is the great dome...its symbolic themes borrowed from Chinese legends, its motifs from Chinese poetry. Coiled within an azure sphere and surrounded by glowing hues of cloud red, emblematic of calamity and welfare; blue of rain; green symbolic of plaque; black of flood; and gold of prosperity--is the Great Dragon, guardian genius of the place, his presence shadowed and multiplied in varying forms throughout the structure. On the huge beams surrounding and supporting the dome are five-clawed dragons--the Emperor's emblem--spitting fire in pursuit of the Jewel, rendered in the shape of a disc emitting effulgent rays, and symbolic of Omnipotence.<ref name="NRHPNomination" />}}

The dragon [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] is repeated in the radial [[coffer]]s of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre. The Imperial dragon is accompanied by the symbol of the Empress, the [[Fenghuang|Chinese phoenix]] ''(Fèng huáng)'', sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese. This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but most prominently in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes. In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre. The highly decorated [[proscenium]] arch and [[safety curtain]] maintain the Chinese design influence.<ref name="NRHPNomination" />

Beyond the decorative features of the building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending [[orchestra pit]] and independent [[Wurlitzer]] organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below.<ref name="OrchestraPit_ST_09-23-26">{{Citation |title= Opening of Fifth Avenue Theatre friday is big event: Rising orchestra pit is feature of theatre |pages= p. 16 col. 1-4 |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |date= 1926-[[September 23|09-23]]}}</ref> The ventilation system had [[thermostat]]ic controls throughout the building, and allowed the air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.<ref name="Ventilation_ST_09-23-26" />

== History ==
=== Planning and construction ===
The president and general manager of Pacific Northwest Theatres, Inc., Harry C. Arthur, believed Seattle to be a place of growing importance in the motion picture industry in the mid-1920s, and consequently as the place to invest for the long term.<ref name="ST_09-04-26">{{Citation |title= Seattle's future is best in nation says theatre man |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |pages= p. 10 col. 1-2 |date= 1926-[[September 4|09-04]]}}</ref> Arthur's company absorbed a competing chain of 40 theatres by 1926, and sought further expansion. A large holder of the theatre company's stock and debt was C. D. Stimson who sat on the board of directors of both Pacific Northwest Theatres and the Metropolitan Building Company, developer of what became known as the [[Metropolitan Tract (Seattle)|Metropolitan Tract]]. Stimson promoted the establishment of a theatre district like that which had developed around a theatre he had built in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name="Kreisman_StimsonLegacy">{{cite book |last= Kreisman |first= Lawrence |title= The Stimson Legacy: Architecture in the Urban West |publisher= Willows Press/University of Washington Press |date= 1992 |location= Seattle |pages= 144-145 |isbn= 978-0-96-316300-4}}</ref> The planned Skinner Building with a theatre owned by Arthur's company would complete the Stimson development of the Metropolitan Tract.<ref name="ST_Complete_09-23-26">{{Citation |title= Metropolitan unit complete: Skinner Building ranks high |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |pages= p. 8 col. 1-2 |date= 1926-[[September 23|09-23]]}}</ref>

Gump Company of San Francisco.<ref name="Kreisman_StimsonLegacy" />

Construction began in October 1925 with construction taking 11 months<ref name="ST_Complete_09-23-26" /> and costing $1.5 million.<ref name="presskit">{{cite web |url= http://www.5thavenue.org/download/press-kit-2006-05-15.pdf |title= 5th Avenue Theatre Press Kit |publisher=The 5th Avenue Theatre |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref>

===Grand opening===
[[Image:5th Ave Theater Grand Opening (Seattle) 1926-09.jpg|thumb|right| Opening night.]]The theatre celebrated its grand opening on September 24, 1926 with an opening unit program that included both film and live [[vaudeville]] performances.<ref name="historylink1">{{cite web |first= Eric L. |last= Flom |url= http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3753|title=Fifth (5th) Avenue Theatre opens in Seattle amid gala celebration on September 24, 1926. |publisher= HistoryLink.org |date=2002-04-24 |accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> The opening program included the silent film ''Young April'', Fanchon and Marco's stage presentation ''The Night Club'', and Lipschultz and his Syncopated Soloists.<ref>{{cite news |title= Advertisement for Fifth Avenue Theatre |pages= 8, Col. 5-8 |publisher= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |date= 1926-[[September 23|09-23]]}}</ref> Oliver Wallace, a popular local musician and composer, returned from Portland, Oregon to be the accompanying organist for opening night.

}}</ref>

Opening night was also marked by festivities outside the theatre. Seven blocks of downtown Seattle around the theatre were closed to street car and automobile traffic. Lured by free street car, bus, and taxicab rides, thousands of people packed Fifth Avenue between Seneca Street and Pike Street, University and Union Streets. [[The Seattle Times]] reported:

{{quote|It is doubtful that any Friday night in Seattle's history saw more people circulating through all the downtown streets than were there last night. The density in the center of the activities was such that street cars were diverted...<ref name="Throng_ST_09-25-26">{{cite news |title= Throng sees theatre open |pages= 1 col. 3-5 |publisher= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |date= 1926-09-25
}}</ref>|[[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]]}}

In the street outside the theatre a street carnival took place. Living up to the moniker for the theater's marquee, “the Magic Sign of a Wonderful Time,” spotlights scanned the night sky, banks of [[Klieg light]]s illuminated the streets outside the theater, and flares were shot from the roofs of nearby buildings.<ref name="historylink2"/> Additionally, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment and, using giant screens to project the words, a sing-along was orchestrated on Fifth Avenue in front of the theatre. An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.<ref name="historylink1" />

=== Decline and restoration ===
Following the grand opening, the theatre served as a venue for vaudeville and film, and following the decline of vaudeville as a movie palace until the 1970s. With the economic [[recession]], the advent of [[history of television|television]], and movie complex development in the suburbs, crowds dwindled and the theatre struggled to stay open. It was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theater, an office building, or a shopping center.<ref name="historictheater">{{cite web |url= http://www.5thavenue.org/about/ourhistorictheater.aspx |title= Our Historic Theater |publisher= The 5th Avenue Theatre |accessdate= 2007-02-28}}</ref><ref name="historylink2">{{cite web |first= Eric L. |last= Flom |url= http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3750 |title= Fifth (5th) Avenue Theatre |publisher= HistoryLink.org |date=2002-04-21 |accessdate= 2007-03-24}}</ref><ref name="still"/><ref name="presskit"/> The city of Seattle was unable to protect the theatre as a designated landmark because of its unique position on the site of the original territorial university grounds owned by the state of Washington.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Kreisman |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=A20000117010259&date=2000-01-16 |title=Historic Times |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2000-01-16 |accessdate= 2008-03-16}}</ref>

In 1979, 43 business leaders formed the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre Association and underwrote a US$2.6 million loan to save the theatre.<ref name="founders">{{cite web |url=http://www.5thavenue.org/about/founders.aspx |title=Founders |publisher=The 5th Avenue Theatre |accessdate= 2007-02-28}}</ref> Among these was [[Ned Skinner]] of the Skinner shipbuilding family who was an active patron of the theatre.<ref name="historylink3">{{cite web |first=David |last=Wilma |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7195 |title=Skinner, Ned (1920-1988) and Kayla (1919-2004) |publisher=HistoryLink.org |date=2005-01-03 |accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> Architect Richard McCann oversaw the restoration efforts.<ref>{{cite web |first=Philbert |last=Gray |url=http://cinematreasures.org/news/17837_0_1_10_C10/ |title=Fox Riverside Theatre restoration begins with a cloud of dust |publisher=CinemaTreasures.org |date=2007-12-14 |accessdate=2008-03-28}}</ref>

Several changes were made during the renovation. The vertical marquee, which had marked the theatre's presence from 1926 to 1980, was removed,<ref name="marquee">{{cite web |first= Lee |last= Moriwaki |url= http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2539156&date=1997-05-14

However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. The renovation made it suitable again for live performances and filled Seattle's need for a touring Broadway musical venue. Renovation work was completed without federal, state, or local funds.<ref name="presskit"/>

June 16, 1980 marked the theatre’s rebirth and a new chapter in Seattle’s arts community. At the Grand Opening Gala for the renovated theatre, actress [[Helen Hayes]] christened the stage with a kiss and declared the 5th “a national treasure.” Beginning on July 3 the 5th presented ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', the first touring Broadway musical to appear at the theatre. The sold-out show ran for 10 weeks with a total of 77 performances.<ref name="chronology">{{cite web |url=http://www.5thavenue.org/about/musicalchronology.aspx |title=Musical Chronology |publisher=The 5th Avenue Theatre |accessdate= 2008-03-16}}</ref>

The 5th Avenue Theatre continues to thrive with the assistance of many generous donors and volunteers.<ref name="historictheater"/><ref name="still"/>

===Post-1980 history===
Since the renovation, the 5th Avenue Theatre has become one of Seattle's most established theatres. In 1989, The 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company was established as the resident non-profit theatre company.<ref name="founders" /> 

In 1997, the theatre applied for a city permit to put up a vertical marquee similar to the sign that was removed as part of the 1980 renovation. The proposed sign would spell out "5th Avenue" in vertical letters, with the word "Theatre" at the bottom in horizontal letters. Small lights would illuminate the sign. To date, the vertical sign has not returned, most likely due to the city height limit of 65 feet for downtown signs. The theater had applied for a variance because its proposed sign would rise 79 feet from street level.<ref name="marquee"/>

On February 28, 2001, the [[2001 Nisqually earthquake|Nisqually earthquake]] rocked the 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]''. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural damage from the quake.<ref name="presskit"/> Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces in the ceiling. Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior crevice in the ceiling eight stories up -- the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance.<ref name="earthquake">{{cite news |url=http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2002/08/05/daily32.html |title=5th Avenue Theatre renovation begins |publisher=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]] |date=2002-08-05 |accessdate=2008-03-29}}</ref> As part of the repair work, [[Turner Construction]] provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.<ref name="turnerconstruction">{{cite web |url=http://www.turnerconstruction.com/seattle/content.asp?d=1513&p=1382 |title=Skinner Building Seismic Upgrades |publisher=turnerconstruction.com |accessdate=2008-03-16}}</ref>

==Significance==
Preceding [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], [[California]], the 5th Avenue Theatre "has been called the largest and most authentic example of traditional Chinese timber architecture and decoration outside of Asia."<ref name="NRHPNomination" /> In addition, its association with architect [[Robert Reamer]], whose other notable works include the nationally known [[Old Faithful Inn]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]], as well as many important buildings in the [[Art Deco]] style add to its significance.<ref name="Ochsner_Architects" /> The Fifth Avenue Theatre was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1978.<ref name="NRHP_NRIS">{{cite web |title= National Register Information System (NRIS) |publisher= National Park Service |url= http://www.nr.nps.gov/ |accessdate= 2007-08-13}}</ref>

==The 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company==
===Genesis===
From the renovation in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as a venue for touring Broadway shows. As the [[United States]] went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for extended periods of time. However, the 5th remained open during these years with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.<ref name="chronology" /><ref name="showarchives" /><ref name="anniversary">{{cite news |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=fifthaved24&date=2005-05-24 |title=5th Avenue Theatre emits silver sparks |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2005-05-24 |accessdate= 2008-03-16}}</ref>

This situation forced the theatre to move beyond merely being a presenter of touring musicals. In 1989, the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre established a resident theatre company, dubbed The 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company, to produce musicals locally. Ever since the theatre company's establishment, the 5th's subscriber season programming has included 4 to 7 shows per year comprised of a mix of national touring musicals, locally produced revivals of musical theatre classics, and premieres of bound-for-Broadway shows. With 150 [[musical theater]] performances each fall-to-spring subscriber season which attract over 30,000 subscribers and average ticket sales of 300,000 tickets annually, the 5th ranks among the nation's largest musical theatre companies.<ref name="annualreport">{{cite web |url=http://www.5thavenue.org/download/5thAvenue_AnnualReport.pdf |title= 5th Avenue Theatre 2005-2006 Season Report To The Community |publisher=The 5th Avenue Theatre |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref><ref name="About Us"/><ref name="armstrong"/><ref name="earthquake"/>

===TUTS partnership===
Frank M. Young was the first executive director of the 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company. From 1989 to 1999 a collaborative partnership existed between the 5th and Houston's [[Theatre Under The Stars (Houston)|Theatre Under the Stars (TUTS)]] where Young also served as executive director.<ref name="young1">{{cite news |last=Berson |first=Misha |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2990908&date=1999-10-24 |title=The Time Is Right For Changes At 5Th Avenue |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=1999-10-24 |accessdate= 2008-03-28}}</ref><ref name="armstrong">{{cite news |last=Berson |first=Misha |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=4015174&date=2000-04-13 |title=New York director is hired for top job at 5th Avenue |publisher=[[Houston Business Journal]] |date=1996-12-13 |accessdate= 2008-03-28}}</ref><ref name="young2">{{cite news |last=Perin |first=Monica |url=http://seattle.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/1996/12/16/focus1.html |title=The Time Is Right For Changes At 5Th Avenue |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=1999-10-24 |accessdate= 2008-03-28}}</ref> This partnership produced 10 seasons of musical theater, including both national tours and self-produced musicals. On October 17, 1989 the first 5th Avenue/TUTS self-produced musical was presented: [[Mame]], starring [[Juliet Prowse]]. After premiering at the 5th in 1995, ''[[Jekyll & Hyde (musical)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'' became the first 5th Avenue Theatre production to open on Broadway in April 1997. The show was produced in cooperation with Houston's Alley Theatre and TUTS.<ref name="presskit"/>

In August of 2000 the 5th’s partnership with TUTS ended as David Armstrong joined the 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company as its first resident Producing Artistic Director launching a new era of collaboration with leading musical theater companies and producers across the country.<ref name="annualreport"/><ref name="armstrong"/>

===Broadway "testing ground"===
Since the creation of the 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company in 1989, the 5th Avenue Theatre has established a tradition of being a "testing ground" for new musicals before they make their debut on Broadway. Since 2000 the 5th has produced one pre-Broadway world premiere every 2 to 3 years. {{quote|We've become a very sought-after partner for developing Broadway musicals.<ref name="spotlight">{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Freeman |url=http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2006/01/23/focus6.html |title=National spotlight shines on Seattle stages |publisher=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]] |date=2006-01-20 |accessdate=2008-03-29}}</ref>|David Armstrong|''Producing Artistic Director''}}
Some of the more notable musicals shown to Seattle audiences at the 5th Avenue Theatre prior to their success on Broadway include: ''[[Jekyll & Hyde (musical)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'' in 1995 which was [[51st Tony Awards|nominated for 4 Tony Awards]], ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' in 2002 which won [[57th Tony Awards|8 Tony Awards]], and ''[[The Wedding Singer (musical)|The Wedding Singer]]'' in 2006 which had [[60th Tony Awards|4 Tony Award nominations]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/theater/168297_tf109.html |title=5th Avenue to launch 'Princesses' |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=2004-04-09 |accessdate= 2008-03-16}}</ref> The [[Hairspray (2007 film)|film adaptation of ''Hairspray'']] premiered at the 5th on July 16, 2007 (4 days prior to its nationwide release) as an acknowledgement of the 5th's role in the musical's success on Broadway.<ref>{{cite news |first=Patti |last=Payne |url=http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2007/07/23/tidbits2.html |title=Seattle welcomes 'Hairspray' the movie with a boisterous, bawdy premiere |publisher=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]] |date=2007-07-20 |accessdate= 2008-03-29}}</ref> The "testing ground" tradition continued in the 2008-2009 season with the pre-Broadway world premiere of ''[[Shrek (musical)|Shrek the musical]]''.<ref name="shrek1"/>

===Community outreach programs===
The theatre also hosts a variety of special events, and offers a number of education and outreach programs to school-age children and adults reaching over 55,000 students, professional performers, and audiences each year.<ref name="About Us">{{cite web |url= http://www.5thavenue.org/about/ |title= About Us|publisher=The 5th Avenue Theatre |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> One example of this is the 5th Avenue High School Musical Theatre Awards which evaluate and honor the performances of student actors and stage hands in [[Washington]] state high school productions.
