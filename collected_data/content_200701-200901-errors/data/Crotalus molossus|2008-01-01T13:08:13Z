'''''Crotalus molossus''''' is a [[venomous snake|venomous]] [[Crotalinae|pitviper]] [[species]] found in the southwestern [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. Four [[subspecies]] are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.<ref name="ITIS">{{ITIS|ID=174314|taxon=Crotalus molossus|year=2007|date=24 February}}</ref>

==Description==
[[Image:Crotalus molossus molossus CDC.png|left|thumb|240px|''C. m. molossus'']] This is a medium-sized species<ref name="C&L04"/> that averages 76-107 cm in length.<ref name="Con75">Conant R. 1975. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America. Second Edition. First published in 1958. Houghton Mifflin Company Boston. 429 pp. 48 plates. ISBN 0-395-19979-4. ISBN 0-395-19979-8 (pbk.).</ref> Large specimens are usually not much more than 100 cm, although lengths of 125.0 cm (Gloyd, 1940), 125.7 cm (Klauber, 1972) and 129.5 cm (Shaw & Campbell, 1974) have been reported.<ref name="C&L04"/> The females tend to be larger than the males.

They range in color from olive greens, to yellows, to browns, all the way to black. As their name implies, one of their most distinguishing features is that despite variations capable in body color, the tail scales are entirely black. Often these rattlesnakes have a black band that goes across their eyes and diagonally down to the corners of their mouth forming a sort of facial 'mask'.

Like other rattlesnakes, ''C. molossus'' has a rattle composed of [[keratin]] on the end of the tail. Each time the [[snake]] sheds its skin, a new segment is added to the rattle. They can shed their skin several times a year, and the rattle is fairly fragile and can be broken, so the length of a [[rattlesnake]]'s rattle is not an accurate measure of its age.

==Common names==
Black-tailed rattlesnake, green rattler,<ref name="C&L04"/> northern black-tailed rattlesnake, dog-faced rattlesnake, dog-headed rattlesnake, mountain diamondback.<ref name="W&W57"/>

==Geographic range==
Found in the southwestern [[United States]] in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]] and west and central [[Texas]], and [[Mexico]] as far south as [[Oaxaca]]. Also found in the [[Gulf of California]] on [[Isla San Esteban|San Estéban Island]] and [[Tiburón Island]]. The distribution reaches a maximum elevation of 2930 m. The [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] given is "Fort Webster, St. Rita del Cobre, N. Mex." (Fort Webster, Santa Rita del Cobre, Grant County, New Mexico, USA).<ref name="McD99"/>

==Conservation status==
This species is classified as Least Concern (LC) on the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]] (v3.1, 2001).<ref name="ICUN">{{Redlist species|no=64324|genus=Crotalus|species=molossus|date=13 September|year=2007}}</ref> Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The population trend is stable. Year assessed: 2007.<ref name="ICUN-31">{{Redlist CC2001|date=13 September|year=2007}}</ref>

==Behavior==
All [[rattlesnakes]] are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], their primary food sources being [[rodents]], other small [[mammals]], [[birds]], and small [[reptiles]]. The behavior of Northern black-tailed [[rattlesnakes]] varies over the course of a year. In the spring and fall they are primarily [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]]. In the summer they shift to a [[nocturnal]] behavior, to avoid the heat of summer. In the winter, they hibernate in dens created and abandoned by other animals, often with other species of [[snake]]. They are variable in their form of locomotion depending on what substrate the need to traverse and will actively change between sidewinding or rectilinear movement. Although they are able climbers and expert swimmers, ''C. molossus'' is primarily a terrestrial species and inhabits grasslands, desert areas, rocky and mountainous areas, as well as higher altitude forested habitats.

==Reproduction==
Breeding occurs in the spring when males follow the [[pheromone]] trails of the females. Copulation can sometimes last for hours and happen multiple times over a period of days. After mating, the male often stays near the female for several days to prevent any other males from mating with her. The female gives birth to live young in the summer months, and the babies only stay with the mother only until they wander off on their own, usually less than a day or two. Females are believed to breed every year, and can have litters as large as 10-12 young, but usually averages 4-6. Their lifespan averages 15-20 years.
