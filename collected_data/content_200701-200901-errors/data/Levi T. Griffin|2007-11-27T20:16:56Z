Griffin, born in [[Clinton, New York]], was named for his maternal grandfather, Levi Thomas of [[Utica, New York]]. He moved with his parents to [[Rochester, Michigan]] in the fall of 1847.

While studying for the [[bar (law)|bar]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], he was employed as a court deputy in the [[United States District Court for the District of Michigan|Federal District Court]] through the assistance of a fellow University of Michigan alumni, William A. Moore, who was then Assistant [[United States District Attorney]]. Griffin was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] in May 1858 and in November moved to [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], where he begin to practice in the office of prominent Western Michigan lawyer Lucius Patterson. After a fire destroyed the offices in April 1860, along with most of the records of [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]], Griffin returned to Detroit where he was employed in the law offices of Moore until January 1862, when they formed a partnership named "Moore and Griffin".

On [[February 24]], [[1864]], he was commissioned as [[Captain]], and on [[September 15]] was assigned as Acting Assistant [[Adjutant General]] of the [[Cavalry in the American Civil War|Second Cavalry Division]].
