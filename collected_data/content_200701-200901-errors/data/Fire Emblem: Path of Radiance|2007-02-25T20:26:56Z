{{nihongo|'''''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'''''|ファイアーエムブレム 蒼炎の軌跡|Faiā Emuburemu: Sōen no Kiseki}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[tactical role-playing game]] developed by [[Intelligent Systems|Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd.]] and published by [[Nintendo Co., Ltd.]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] [[video game console]]. The game was released on [[April 20]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] in [[Japan]], [[October 17]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] in [[North America]], [[November 15]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] in [[Europe]] and [[December 1]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] in [[Australia]]. It is the ninth ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series title, the third ''Fire Emblem'' series title to be released in [[North America]], and the first ''Fire Emblem'' series title to be rendered in a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]], [[cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] manner. It is also the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to be released for a home console in [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]].

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' is set on a fictional continent called [[Tellius]]. The storyline is all-new, and is completely unrelated to any of the previous ''Fire Emblem'' titles in the series. The protagonist, [[Ike (Fire Emblem)|Ike]], the son of [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Major non-playable characters|Greil]], begins the game as the newest member of his father's mercenary company, the Greil Mercenaries. The company operates within the borders of Crimea, a nation of humans (referred to as "beorc") that shares its southern border with Gallia, a nation of beast laguz, or humanoids capable of transforming into animals. A few chapters into the game, another neighboring beorc nation, Daein, invades Crimea, and soon after, Ike comes across an unconscious woman in a forest that turns out to be the Crimean princess, [[Elincia Ridell Crimea]]. Faced with the ruthless Daein assault, Greil leads the mercenaries out of Crimea and towards Gallia, but is mortally wounded by a Daein general known only as the Black Knight. These events mark the beginning of a long journey that will take Ike, Elincia, and the mercenaries across the continent and back in an effort to defeat Daein and restore Crimea's royalty to the throne.

Over the course of the game, Ike and his companions must overcome long-held racial tensions between the beorc and laguz in order to form an alliance against their true enemy, [[Ashnard]], king of Daein. In particular, Ike manages to reestablish relations between the beorc nation of Begnion and the few remaining members of the heron laguz clan, which was annihilated in an act of [[genocide]] during the [[Serenes Massacre]]. With this accomplishment, Ike is given command of a patchwork army that he leads into Daein and finally back to Crimea, where he confronts the Black Knight and ultimately King Ashnard himself. 

===The Fire Emblem===
In the Tellius universe, the Fire Emblem takes the form of a simple bronze medallion, also known as Lehran's Medallion, which holds the soul of an evil god whose energies disrupt the level of chaotic energy in a person. One such example was when [[Greil]] touched the medallion. It caused him to go mad and kill everyone in sight, including his wife. It was only when she took the medallion from his hand in her final moments that Greil regained his sanity. Greil cuts the tendons in his sword arm afterwards, thereby inhibiting his ability to wield Ragnell, to prevent causing any more damage. Only a person with the purest of spirits is capable of holding the medallion without losing his or her mind. Ike's mother and his younger sister, Mist, are two such people.

The medallion once belonged to the Heron clans that dwelled in the Serenes Forest next to Benigon. They were charged with protecting the medallion so that the evil god would not be released. However the Serenes Massacre forced Lillia, one of the Heron royal family, to flee with the medallion, only to be captured by Ashnard or someone working under him. Lillia was ordered to free the god, but Lillia instead befriended Elena, Ike's mother, and gave the medallion to her. Elena along with her husband Greil then fled Daein.

In the final chapter (of "Maniac" difficulty in the Japanese version and "Difficult" in the North American version), [[Ashnard]] uses the medallion after his initial defeat and gains godlike power, but is somehow able to remain sane. It may be that Ashnard's heart is so dark that he is able to channel the dark god's power from the medallion without losing his senses. Others say that it's because it was not possible for him to go more insane in the first place (hence his nickname "Mad" King Ashnard). {{endspoiler}}

==Gameplay mechanics==
In comparison with previous ''Fire Emblem'' games, there are some changes to the game basics, as some classes have been removed and some have been added. Some of the most intriguing changes are the laguz changelings, humanoid creatures that can transform into powerful animals when a certain meter fills up. There are three species (beasts, birds, and dragons) divided into three classes each, although not all of them are playable. Beast laguz are divided into cats, tigers, and lions; birds into ravens, hawks, and herons; and dragons are divided into red, white, and black. Another useful addition is the Shove command, which allows non-mounted characters with a high weight to push other characters one space over on the map grid. There is also a new weapon forging system which lets players create their own versions of basic weapons or magic tomes at a greater gold cost.

Like the previous ''Fire Emblem'' games, when a character falls, they cannot be used in battle ever again. Although some characters will not truly die if defeated (they will retreat and stay on the sideline for the rest of the game), others will never be seen again, possibly resulting in missed plot details and secrets left unrevealed. The characters are so well developed that some players end up reaching for the reset button very often in the later chapters.

This installment of the ''Fire Emblem'' series is the first released in the US where the player does not necessarily need any items to promote a character (where a player changes a character's class to a new and often exponentially more powerful one). While some of the ones for the Super Famicom also had this feature, none of the US-released GBA games did.

Skills, which have appeared in some ''Fire Emblem'' games, have different mechanics in this game. Each character has a gauge that allows for mastery of skills. By mastering a skill (done by using one of many skill scrolls found throughout the game) a certain amount of slots are taken up in the gauge, usually determined by how useful the skill is. The space of the gauge varies between classes and characters. Any unit can learn any skill, with two exceptions. 
*The skill is preassigned to a unit and there is no scroll item capable of teaching it to others. 
*The skill is an occult skill. Occult skills are gained by using an occult scroll on any unit. The actual skill gained is class specific -- most notably, Ike's Aether and Volke's Lethality. Occult skills can only be learned by promoted units.

Bonus Experience is a unique feature to the game. At the end of every chapter, certain factors such as enemies remaining and turns to clear a chapter add towards experience that can be awarded to any unit at the base of any chapter. This function can be helpful for units who are too weak to battle, or units that the player wishes to level up quickly. This system was inserted due to the lack of arenas in ''Path of Radiance'', an optional feature often used in other Fire Emblem games to train party members.

Additionally, this is the first Fire Emblem game released in America to feature a "Base screen" along with the "Battle Preparations" screen. Before the Base screen appears, Soren provides information on the previous battle, including the units gained, casualties, most used unit in the chapter, and Gold and Bonus Experience gained. The Base allows for easy management of units, buying and selling items and equipment, forging weapons, and the distribution of bonus experience and skills. Furthermore, support conversations, which were triggered during battle in previous games, are now played through the Base screen. The Base screen is also home to special "Info" conversations, chapter-specific conversations rated on a scale of one to three stars. One star typically denotes conversations that provide story background, two stars mark conversations that provide hints on how to proceed in the coming battle, and three stars indicate that the conversation may yield a special item or a new recruit.

Releases outside of Japan omit the extremely hard "Maniac" mode, replacing it with an "Easy" mode and a recalibrated "Difficult" mode that uses some elements of the Maniac difficulty.

==Graphics engine==
''Path of Radiance'' is the first ''Fire Emblem'' title to feature three-dimensional graphics on the battlefield, replacing two-dimensional sprite animations and landscapes with fully-rendered 3-D models. It is also the first game in the series to make use of [[Full Motion Video]] to present cinematic sequences at key points in the game. The FMV sequences were animated by [[Production I.G.]].

==Voice cast==
===Japanese language cast===
In the original Japanese version's FMV sequences of ''Path of Radiance'', Ike's Japanese [[seiyuu]] (voice actor) was [[Michihiko Hagi]], Mist was voiced by [[Atsuko Enomoto]], Elincia was voiced by [[Juri Takita]], Greil was voiced by [[Takashi Nagasako]] (seiyuu for [[Ganon]]dorf from the [[The Legend of Zelda series|''Legend of Zelda'' series]]) and The Black Knight was voiced by [[Junji Majima]]. Nagasako is also the narrator in the Japanese version of ''Path of Radiance''.
===English language cast===
In the English language version's FMV sequences, Ike's voice was provided by [[Jason Adkins]], Mist was voiced by [[Elsbeth Nathanson]], Elincia by [[Erica Evans]], Greil and the narrator by [[Stephen Weyte]] and the Black Knight by [[Mark Dias]].

==Musical score==
The ''Fire Emblem'' series' veteran music composer [[Yuka Tsujiyoko]] was actively involved in providing the musical score for ''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance''. ''Path of Radiance'' was also co-scored by [[Yoshito Hirano]], [[Saki Haruyama]], [[Naoko Mitome]], [[Atsushi Yoshida]] and [[Kaneko Teramae]] with vocals by [[Noriko Aoki]] and [[Masatsugu Igarashi]]. ''Path of Radiance'' is also the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to feature a theme song with vocals, "Life Returns," which is sung in the fictional language of the heron tribe.

==Reviews==
The game received mostly positive reviews after its release. Game Rankings, a website that provides video games with percentile scores based on the score average collected from a variety of review sources rated the game with an 86%.[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920189.asp]

The following is a sample of the positive review scores that ''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' received upon its release in North America:

*[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]: 8.0, 8.5, 8.0 out of 10
*[[Nintendo Power]]: 9.5/10
*[[GameSpot]]: 8.6 out of 10
*[[GamePro]]: 4.0 out of 5
*[[X-Play]]: 4 out of 5
*[[IGN]]: 8.7 out of 10
*[[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Games]]: 4 out of 5
*[[Game Informer]]: 9 out of 10
*[[JIVE Magazine|Jive Magazine]]: 5 out of 5 stars

==Trivia==
*Although Greil appears in the game's instruction manual in a picture accompanying the description of the "Hero" unit and in the prologue as a Hero "unit," he is never actually enabled as a playable character. There are rumors suggesting that he may become playable on the bonus maps should the player beat the game twenty times, but these rumors are untrue. But he does contain data in the game and, through cheating devices, can be made playable.
*It is possible to unlock some of the boss characters for use in the bonus trial maps by beating the game multiple times. In order, they are Oliver (3 times), Shiharam (5 times), Petrine (7 times), Bryce (10 times), and Ashnard (15 times).
*Many battle animations in ''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' are based on those in ''[[Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu]]''. "Side Battle," the musical score used on the trial maps, was also from Chapter 10 in that game.
*Song #30, "Vow," is a remade version of [[Fire Emblem (Game Boy Advance)|Fire Emblem]]'s Song #47, "A Knight's Oath."
*Song #63, "Life Returns" (the credits) is the first song in the Fire Emblem series to have lyrics, supposedly sung in the made-up language Galldr (the language of the Herons), but apparently it's all just backwards Japanese.[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/elaice/fe9/galldr.html]
*This is the first American released game where the units stay in their position after attacking instead of going back to the space they were occupying before they attacked.
*''[[Fire Emblem: The Goddess of Dawn]]'' for the [[Wii]] will be set in the same universe as ''Path of Radiance'', confirmed to be three years after Path of Radiance events{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. One of the earliest characters confirmed to appear in the game is Sothe, who appears to be several years older in early promotional artwork for the game.
