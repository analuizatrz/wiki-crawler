'''''The Amazing Spider-Man''''' is an [[American comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]], featuring the adventures of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]].

==Publication history==
[[Spider-Man]] first appeared in the [[comic book]] ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1962). The series was cancelled with that issue, but response to the character was so positive that a solo title, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', was launched with a March 1963 cover-date.

The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], and the pair produced 38 issues from 1963 to 1966. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero.

''The Amazing Spider-Man'' is the character's flagship series. Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced here, and it is where key events occur. The title was published continuously until 1998 when Marvel Comics relaunched it with a new issue #1 (Jan. 1999), but on Spider-Man's 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue #500 (Dec. 2003)

===The 1960s===
The initial years of the book, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man's nascent career with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored teenager Peter Parker. Parker balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance [[photographer]] for ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' (under the bombastic editor-publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]]) to help support himself and his frail [[Aunt May]]. At the same time, Parker dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Liz Allan (Marvel Comics)|Liz Allan]] at Midtown High School, while also embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, [[Betty Brant]].

By focusing on Parker's everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a [[protagonist]] and not a [[sidekick]]. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, [[Jack Kirby]], and Ditko's Spider-Man, slightly sinister yet affectionately cartoony,{{Fact|date=January 2008}} combined with the humor and pathos of Lee's writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.

Most of Spider-Man's key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue #1 (March 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson and his [[astronaut]] son [[John Jameson]], and the supervillain the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. It also included the hero's first encounter with the superhero team [[The Fantastic Four]]. Issue #2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of [[Vulture (comics)|The Vulture]] and the beginning of Parker's freelance [[photography]] career at the newspaper ''The Daily Bugle''.

The Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including [[Doctor Octopus]] in #3 (July 1963); the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and Betty Brant in #4 (Sept. 1963); the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] in #6 (Nov. 1963); [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] in #9 (March 1964); [[Mysterio]] in #13 (June 1964); the [[Green Goblin]] in #14 (July 1964); [[Kraven The Hunter]] in #15 (Aug. 1964); reporter [[Ned Leeds]] in #18 (Nov. 1964); the  [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]] in #20 (Jan. 1965); and the [[Molten Man]] in #28 (Sept. 1965), an issue that also featured Parker's graduation from high school

Parker began attending [[Empire State University]] in #31 (Dec. 1965), the issue which also featured the first appearances of friends and classmates [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Harry Osborn]]. Harry's father, [[Norman Osborn]] first appeared in #23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson's country club but is not named nor revealed as Harry's father until #37 (June 1966). Probably the most celebrated issue of the Lee-Ditko run{{Fact|date=January 2008}} is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc "If This Be My Destiny", and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery.

Although credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. However, a rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' [[Marveldatabase:Amazing Spider-Man 38|#38]] (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have been a source of controversy{{Fact|date=January 2008}} ever since.

In successor penciler [[John Romita Sr.]]'s first issue, #39 (Aug. 1966), archnemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero.  Romita's Spider-Man – more muscular and heroic-looking than Ditko's – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[managing editor]] [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]] in #52 (Sept. 1967) and [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], father of Parker's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], in #56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was Mary Jane Watson, who made her first full appearance in #42, (Nov. 1966), although she first appeared  in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since #15 (Aug. 1964).

Lee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker's world by improving Parker's relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures. The stories also became more topical, addressing issues such as [[civil rights]], [[racism]], [[prisoners' rights]], the [[Vietnam War]], and political elections.

Issue #50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], who would become a major force as well in the superhero series ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]''. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the [[Rhino]] in #41 (Oct. 1966), the [[Shocker (comics)|The Shocker]] in #46 (March 1967), the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] in #78 (Nov. 1969), and the Kingpin's son, [[Richard Fisk]], in #83 (April 1970).

===The 1970s===
Two spin-off series debuted in the 1970s: ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' in 1972, and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' in 1976. The flagship title's second decade took a grim turn with a story in #89-90 (Oct.-Nov. 1970) featuring the death of Captain [[George Stacy]]. This was also the first Spider-Man story to be penciled by [[Gil Kane]], who would alternate drawing duties with Romita for the next year-and-a-half and would draw several landmark issues.

One such story took place in the controversial issues #96-98 (May-July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the [[Comics Code Authority]] with this story, in which Parker's friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after tripping on [[LSD]]. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the US [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.

The "Six-Arm Saga" of #100-102 (Sept.-Nov. 1971) introduced [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]]. The second installment was the first ''Amazing Spider-Man'' story not written by co-creator Lee, with  [[Roy Thomas]] taking over writing the book for several months before Stan Lee returned to write #105-110 (Feb.-July 1972). Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics' publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old [[wunderkind]] [[Gerry Conway]], who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway's first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] in #113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler, although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.

The most memorable work of the Conway/Kane/Romita team was #121-122 (June-July 1973), which featured  the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of The Green Goblin in the story which shocked readers, "[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]" (#121).  Her demise and the Goblin's apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man. The aftermath of the story also deepened both the characterization of [[Mary Jane Watson]] and her relationship with Parker.

By late 1973, Gil Kane was succeeded by [[Ross Andru]], whose run lasted nearly 60 issues, from 1973 to 1978. Issue #129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the [[Punisher]], who would become one of Marvel Comics' principal and most widely recognized characters. The Conway-Andru era also featured the first appearances of the [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]] in #124-125 (Sept.-Oct 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #131 (April 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father's role as the Green Goblin in #135-137 (Aug.-Oct. 1974); and the original "[[Clone Saga]]", containing the introduction of [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man's clone]], in #147-149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975).

[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and Gil Kane produced the title's 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before [[Len Wein]] became writer for two-and-a-half years.During Wein's tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged, J. Jonah Jameson was introduced to his eventual second wife, Marla Madison, and Aunt May suffered a heart attack. Wein's last story on ''Amazing'' was a five-issue arc in #176-180 (Jan.-May 1978) featuring a third Green Goblin (Harry Osborn’s psychiatrist, Bart Hamilton). [[Marv Wolfman]], Marvel's editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer, and in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson (who refused, in the following issue). [[Keith Pollard]] succeeded Ross Andru as artist shortly afterward, and with Wolfman introduced the likable rogue the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979). As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade.

===The 1980s===

''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200 (Jan. 1980) featured the return and death of the [[Burglar (comics)|burglar]] who killed Spider-Man's Uncle Ben. Writer Marv Wolfman and penciler Keith Pollard both left the title by mid-year, succeeded by [[Dennis O'Neil]], a writer known for groundbreaking 1970s work at rival [[DC Comics]], and penciler [[John Romita, Jr.]]. [[Roger Stern]], who had written nearly 20 issues of sister title ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', took over ''Amazing'' in late 1981. During his two years on the title, Stern augmented the backgrounds of long-established Spider-Man villains, and with Romita Jr. created the mysterious supervillain the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] in #238-239 (March-April 1983). Fans engaged with the mystery of the Hobgoblin's secret identity, which continued throughout #244-245 and 249-251 (Sept.-Oct. 1983 & Feb.-April 1984).  One lasting change was the reintroduction of [[Mary Jane Watson]] as a much more serious, mature woman who becomes Peter's confidant after she reveals that she knows his secret identity.

By mid-1984, [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish the maturation in Parker and Watson's relationship, laying the foundation for the character's eventual wedding. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), with the first appearance of Spider-Man's black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years' worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]], in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in #258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a [[symbiote]]; and the introduction of the female mercenary [[Silver Sable]] in #265 (June 1985).

Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz were both removed from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' in 1986 by editor Owsley under acrimonious circumstances.<ref>[http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/adventures/frames/spidey.htm Digital Priest] (Owsley official site)</ref> A succession of artists including [[Alan Kupperberg]], [[John Romita, Jr.]], and [[Alex Saviuk]] penciled the book from 1987 to 1988; Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part "Gang War" story (#284-288) that DeFalco plotted. Former ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' writer [[Peter David]] scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed the late Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin (although this was [[retconned]] in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all).

[[David Michelinie]] took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290-292 (July-Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #21. Issue #298 (March 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star [[Todd McFarlane]], the first regular artist on ''Amazing Spider-Man'' since Frenz's departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man's look. His depiction – large-eyed, with wiry, contorted limbs, and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane's other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man's most wildly popular antagonists, the [[supervillain]] [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]]. Issue #299 (April 1988) featured Venom's first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue also featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.

Other notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315-317 (May-July 1989), with the return of Venom. After the editorial and creative turmoil that beset ''Amazing Spider-Man'' in 1987, the Michelinie/McFarlane team at the tail-end of the 1980s restored a sense of creative consistency and quality to the book, and set the tone for Spider-Man for the next decade.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

===The 1990s===
With a civilian life as a married man, the Spider-Man of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades. Following his 1988-1989 run on ''Amazing Spider-Man'', Todd McFarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]''. McFarlane's successor, [[Erik Larsen]], penciled the book from early 1990 to mid-1991. After issue #350, Larsen was succeeded by [[Mark Bagley]], who had won the 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest and was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs followed by a run on ''[[New Warriors]]'' in 1990. Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996, with his art forming the basis for most Spider-Man licensed merchandise of the decade and onward.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Issues #361-363 (April-June 1992) introduced [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], a second symbiote nemesis for Spider-Man. The series' 30th-anniversary issue, #365 (Aug. 1992), was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker's parents, long thought dead, reappearing alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors, who are killed in #388 (April 1994), scripter Michelinie's last issue. His 1987-1994 stint gave him the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee.

With #389, writer [[J.M. DeMatteis]], whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" story arc and a 1991-1993 run on ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, ''Amazing'' stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in #400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May &mdash; later revealed to have been faked. The "[[Clone Saga]]" culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers,{{Fact|date=February 2008}} and was later reversed in the "Revelations" story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.

The Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after #406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by ''The Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1-2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring [[Ben Reilly]]. The series picked up again with #407 (Jan. 1996), with [[Tom DeFalco]] returning as writer. Bagley completed his 5½-year run by September 1996. A succession of artists, including [[Ron Garney]], [[Steve Skroce]], [[Joe Bennett]], and [[Rafael Kayanan]], penciled the book until the final issue,  #441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).



[[Image:MJPARKER.jpg|left|thumb|Promotional art by [[J. Scott Campbell]] for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #51]]
===The reboot===
Marvel began ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' anew with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999). [[Howard Mackie]] wrote the first 29 issues. With #30 (June 2001), [[J. Michael Straczynski]] took over as writer.

Issue #30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume-two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', were given the dual numbering around this time. In October 2000, [[John Romita, Jr.]] succeeded [[John Byrne]] as artist. After vol. 2, #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted to its original numbering for #500 (Dec. 2003), with vol. 2, #1-58 considered #442-499 of the original run. [[Mike Deodato, Jr.]] penciled the book from mid-2004 until 2006.


===Civil War and aftermath===
As part of the 2006 ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' crossover story arc, which included ''The Amazing Spider-Man,'' Spider-Man initially works with Iron Man and the government to fulfill the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], capturing superheroes who refuse to reveal their identities and register with the government. On live television, he reveals his own true identity as Peter Parker, but eventually changes side and, alongside Captain America and others, becomes an opponent of registration.

Almost immediately after going fugitive along with Mary Jane and Aunt May, May is shot by an unnamed assassin hired to kill Parker. Seeking vengeance, Parker retrieves his long-unused black costume (last seen in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #19, July 2000, and ''Spider-Man'' #13, Aug. 1991) in order to send an intimidating message as he tracks down the assassin's employer, the imprisoned Kingpin, whom Spider-Man confronts and humiliates, giving a warning to leave his family alone.

===One More Day===
{{main|Spider-Man: One More Day}}
[[Image:ASM545COV 150.jpg|thumb|Promotional art by [[Joe Quesada]] for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545, the final issue of the Parkers' marriage]]
[[Spider-Man: One More Day|''One More Day'']] is a four-part, crossover story arc, written partially by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]], running through ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #544-545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), and ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24 (Nov. 2007) and ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. The [[demon]] [[Mephisto]] makes a [[Faustian bargain]] with Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson-Parker, offering to save Parker's dying [[Aunt May]] if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts.

===Brand New Day===
{{main|Spider-Man: Brand New Day}}
Following this, Marvel made ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' the company's sole Spider-Man title, upped its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurated the series with the "back to basics" story arc "Brand New Day", in which Parker now found himself in a reality where he and Watson had never married &mdash; neither having any memory of being married together &mdash; and with domino-effect differences in their immediate world. The four initial writer-penciler teams were  [[Dan Slott]] and [[Steve McNiven]]; [[Bob Gale]] and [[Phil Jiminez]]; [[Marc Guggenheim]] and [[Salvador Larroca]]; and [[Zeb Wells]] and [[Chris Bachalo]].
