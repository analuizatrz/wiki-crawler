In [[J. R. R. Tolkien's]] [[fiction]]al universe of [[Middle-earth]], the '''eagles''' are immense flying [[bird]]s that are [[sapient]], and can speak. These creatures have varied in size in films and visualisations. They are assumed to be similar to actual [[eagle]]s (and so to be an independent sentient species of the eagle/buzzard subfamily ''[[Buteoninae]]'' in the same way humans are of the great ape subfamily ''[[Homininae]]''), but much larger.  In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' the Lord of the Eagles, ''[[Thorondor]]'', is said to have a wingspan of 30 fathoms (55&nbsp;m).

The eagles are said in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' to have been "devised" by [[Manwë]] Súlimo, leader of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], and were often called '''Eagles of Manwë'''. They were sent from [[Valinor]] to Middle-earth to keep an eye on the exiled [[Noldor]], and on their foe the evil Vala [[Morgoth]].
 
For a time the Lord of the Eagles, ''[[Thorondor]]'', kept his eyries at the top of [[Thangorodrim]], the three mighty peaks that Morgoth raised from the Iron Mountains above the gates of Angband. While they lived there, Thorondor helped [[Fingon]] rescue [[Maedhros]]. Thorondor's folk later removed their eyries to the [[Crissaegrim]], part of the [[Echoriath]] or ''Encircling Mountains'' about [[Gondolin]]. There they were friends of [[Turgon]], and kept spies off the mountains.

Thorondor slashed Morgoth in the face after Morgoth's battle with [[Fingolfin]], and he carried Fingolfin's body to the Echoriath, where he was buried by Turgon.

The Eagles fought alongside the army of the Valar, [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] and Edain during the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the [[First Age]].

In the [[Second Age]], a pair of Eagles had an eyrie in the King's House in Armenelos the capital of Númenor until the Kings became hostile to the Valar. The Eagles also watched the peak of Mount [[Meneltarma]], and three Eagles would always appear when someone climbed to the summit.

In the [[Third Age]], Thorondor's descendants ''Gwaihir'' and ''Landroval'' lived in an eyrie to the east of the [[Misty Mountains]] in [[Wilderland]].

Before and during the [[War of the Ring]], Gwaihir rescued [[Gandalf]] the Grey from the top of [[Isengard]] and again from [[Zirakzigil]] and, with others of his people, rescued [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] from [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]] after the [[One Ring]] had been destroyed.

In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', no eagles are identified by name.  Only the title ''Lord of the Eagles'' distinguishes the eagle leader from other eagles in this story.  (The text adds that he was given the title ''King of All Birds'' at a later date.) Many readers assume that it was Gwaihir and Landroval who rescued [[Thorin Oakenshield]] and company from a band of [[Warg]]s and [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblin]]s, flying them to the river [[Anduin]], and later assisted in the [[Battle of Five Armies]] fought near [[Erebor]], the Lonely Mountain. However, in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' Gandalf says that Gwaihir has carried him twice before, while the proper count would be three times if Gwaihir and the ''Lord of the Eagles'' were the same individual.

Tolkien's painting of an eagle on a crag appears in some editions of ''The Hobbit''.  According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], the author based this picture on a painting by [[Archibald Thorburn]] of an immature [[Golden Eagle]], which Christopher found for him in ''The Birds of the British Isles'' by [[Thomas Coward|T. A. Coward]].  However, Tolkien's use of this model does not necessarily mean that his birds were ordinary Golden Eagles.  In some of his texts Tolkien speculated that these great Eagles were actually [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]] in bird-shape, as he felt it unlikely [[Ilúvatar]] would grant [[Fëa and hröa|fëa]] to animals. If this is true, then Roäc the Raven and the Thrush, who appear in ''The Hobbit'', might also be Maiar or other spirits in animal form.

In [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy]], these creatures were 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft) tall with a maximum [[wingspan]] of 23&nbsp;m (75&nbsp;ft)<!-- as said in the Red Book. -Is this "Red Book" a movie tie-in book?! Or is it the Weapons and Warfare book, which is worthless from a book perspective? -->.
