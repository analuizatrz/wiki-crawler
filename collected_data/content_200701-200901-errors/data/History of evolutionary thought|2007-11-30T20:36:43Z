'''Evolutionary thought''' has roots in antiquity as philosophical ideas known to the [[Greek philosophy|Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Indian philosophy|Indians]], [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Muslims]]. Until the 18th century, however, [[Western thought|Western]] biological thought was dominated by [[essentialism]], the idea that living forms are static and unchanging in time. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], evolutionary [[cosmology]] and the [[mechanical philosophy]] spread from the physical sciences to [[natural history]], and naturalists such as [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] focused on the variability of species.  The emergence of [[paleontology]] (and with it the notion of [[extinction]]), as well as the dramatic expansion of known species, helped undermine the traditional static view of nature.  The first full theory of evolution was proposed by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in the early 19th century; [[Lamarckism|Lamarck's theory]] was based on the idea that species had an innate drive that pushed them up the [[great chain of being]] and that the mechanism of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] helped them adapt to local conditions.  

The evolutionary theory often referred to as [[Darwinism]] was first publicly put forth by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and discussed in detail in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', published by Darwin in 1859.  Darwinism, which unlike Lamarck's theory proposed [[common descent]] and a branching [[tree of life]], was based on [[natural selection]], and synthesized a wide range of evidence from [[animal husbandry]], [[biogeography]], [[geology]], [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and [[embryology]]. The debate over ''Origin'' would play a key role in the displacement of [[natural theology]] by [[methodological naturalism]] in the life sciences, and raised profound questions about human nature and the place of humanity in the natural world.  

Darwin's work led to the rapid acceptance of [[evolution]], but his proposed mechanism of natural selection was not widely accepted until the early 20th century. Most biologists preferred inheritance of acquired characteristics (neo-Lamarckism), an innate drive for change ([[orthogenesis]]) , or sudden large mutations ([[saltationism]]), as forces driving evolution. This divergence of views was possible because the mechanisms of inheritance and variation were not understood. Progress in these areas occurred during the first two decades of the 20th century with the rediscovery of [[Mendelian genetics]] and [[T.H. Morgan]]'s discoveries about the nature of [[mutation]]. Although there was at first disagreement about what these developments might mean for evolutionary theory, the problem was resolved by the combination of the concept of natural selection with Mendelian genetics during the founding of the discipline of [[population genetics]] in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1930s and 1940s population genetics was integrated with various branches of biology to produce the unified theory of evolution known as the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]], which marked the reemergence of Darwinism as the central evolutionary theory.

Following the synthesis and the rise of [[evolutionary biology]] as a formal scientific discipline, evolutionary thought developed in several directions.  Studies of [[mutation]] and of genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to increasingly sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolutionary change.  Paleontology and [[comparative anatomy]] allowed increasingly detailed and far-reaching reconstructions of the [[history of life]].  Following the rise of [[molecular genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], the field of [[molecular evolution]] arose, based on "informational macromolecules" such as [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein sequence]]s.  [[Gene-centered view of evolution]] rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]]; these ideas sparked sustained debates over [[adaptationism]], the [[units of selection]], and the importance of [[genetic drift]].

In the late 20th century, widespread biological [[sequencing]] led to the reorganization of the tree of life into the modern [[three-domain system]], while the recognition of significant [[symbiogenesis]] and [[horizontal gene transfer]] introduced more complexity into evolutionary history.

===Greek thought===
====Plato and the theory of forms====
[[Plato]] (427/8-347/8 BC) was, in the words of biologist-historian [[Ernst Mayr]], "the great antihero of evolutionism."<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', p. 304</ref>  He established the philosophy of [[essentialism]] which states, objects observed in the real world are reflections of a limited number of essences or ''eide''. Variation is merely the manifestation of imperfect reflections of constant essences. Plato called this the [[theory of forms]]. In his ''Timaeus'', Plato set out the idea that God had created the [[cosmos]] and everything in it as, being good and hence "free from jealousy, he desired that all things  should be as like himself as they could be." God created all conceivable forms of life as "without them the universe will be  incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to  contain, if it is to be perfect". This idea, that all potential life forms are essential in a perfect creation, is called the [[plenitude principle]] and greatly influenced Christian thought.<ref name=oet>{{cite web  | last = Johnston  | first = Ian  | title =Section Three: The Origins of Evolutionary Theory  | work =. . .

====Aristotle and the ladder of life====
[[Aristotle]], (384—322 BC) was one of the most influential [[Greek philosophers]], and the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle did his research on natural history on the isle of [[Lesbos]]. His writings on biology have survived in the form of four books, usually known by their [[Latin]] names:<ref name="Singer_SHB">Singer, Charles ''A Short History of Biology'' 1931.</ref>

* de anima (on the essence of life)
* historia animalium (inquiries about animals)
* de generatione animalium (reproduction)
* de partibus animalium (anatomy)

These works contain some remarkable observations and interpretations by Aristotle, along with sundry myths and mistakes reflecting the uneven state of knowledge of his time. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on catfish, electric fish of the genus [[Torpedo_(genus)|Torpedo]], and angler-fish are exceptional, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]] [[molluscs]] [[Octopus]], [[Sepia|cuttlefish]] and the [[Argonauta argo|paper nautilus]]. His description of the hectocotyl arm (see [[cephalopod]]) was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until the nineteenth century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).<ref name="Singer_SHB"/> 

However, for [[Charles Singer]], "Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''"<ref name="Singer_SHB"/> [[Aristotle]]'s ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical "Ladder  of Life" (''scala naturae''), placing them according to complexity of structure and function, with organisms that showed greater vitality and ability to move described as "higher organisms".<ref name=oet/>

===Indian thought===
There are suggestions of an evolutionary approach in ancient [[Indian philosophy|Indian texts]], especially the [[Vedas]], where the incarnations of [[Vishnu]] reflects the theory of evolution,<ref>[http://www.hinduwebsite.com/evolution.asp Hinduism and evolution]</ref> as well as the writings of [[Patañjali]].

===Chinese thought===
Ideas on evolution were expressed by ancient [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese thinkers]]. For example, according to [[Joseph Needham]], [[Taoism]] explicitly denied the fixity of biological species.<ref> Needham, Ronan (1995) p.101</ref>

===Roman thought===
In the first century BC, the Roman Epicurist and atomist Titus [[Lucretius]] Carus (d. 50 BC) wrote the poem ''De rerum natura'' ([[On the Nature of Things]]) describing the development of the living earth in stages from atoms colliding in the void as swirls of dust, then early plants and animals springing from the early earth's substance, to a succession of animals including a series of progressively less brutish humans. The essence of Lucretius' ideas was naturalism and the avoidance of supernatural interventions or explanations.

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Great_Chain_of_Being_2.png|200 px|thumb|left|This drawing from ''Retorica Christiana'' written by Didacus Valdes in 1579 depcits the great chain of being.]]
===Christian thought and the great chain of being===
After a long period when classical learning was lost to the West, Christian authors combined Aristotle's classification system with Plato's ideas of the goodness of God and of all potential life forms being present in a perfect creation to organize inanimate, animate, and  spiritual beings in a huge interconnected [[great chain of being]]. Thus all could be placed in order from the "lowest" to the "highest," with Hell at the bottom and God at the top above an angelic hierarchy marked by the orbits of the planets, with mankind in an intermediate position and worms the lowest of the animals. As the universe was ultimately perfect, the Great Chain was also perfect. That meant that there were no empty links in the chain, and no link was represented by more than one species. This implied that if every link is occupied, and none are occupied twice, no species can ever move from one position to another, since to do so would leave one level empty and put two species on another. Thus, in Plato's perfect universe, species couldn't ever change and must remain fixed in accordance with the text of ''Genesis''. For humans to forget their position and behave like lower animals or aspire to a higher station was seen as sinful. Creatures on adjacent steps were expected to closely resemble each other, an idea expressed in the saying ''natura non facit saltum'' (nature does not make leaps) which [[Charles Darwin]] often quoted.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fancher|first=Lynn|title=Aristotle and the Great Chain|url=http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/fancher/Aristotl.htm|publisher=College of DuPage|accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref><ref name=oet/> This basic concept greatly influenced the thinking of centuries of [[Western civilization]], and still has an influence today. The great chain of being provided a classification system which was still the major organizing principle for biology in the  17th and 18th centuries, and was part of the [[teleological argument|argument from design]] presented by [[natural theology]].<ref name=oet/>

===Islamic thought===
:''Main article: [[Early Islamic philosophy#Evolution|Early Islamic philosophy - Evolution]]''

Whereas evolutionary ideas more or less died out in Europe after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], they continued to be propounded by [[Islamic science|scientists]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophers]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] during the [[Middle Ages]], where early theories on [[evolution]] and [[natural selection]] were widely taught in medieval [[Madrasah|Islamic schools]] at the time. According to [[al-Khazini]] in the 12th century, ideas on evolution were widespread among "common people" in the Islamic world at the time. The 19th century scientist, philosopher and historian [[John William Draper]] referred to the early Muslim theories on evolution as the "Mohammedan theory of evolution". The term "[[Mohammedan]]" was used to refer to [[Muslim]]s at the time. He compared the early Muslim theories to the modern [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] theory of evolution of his time, arguing that the former was developed "much farther than we are disposed to do, extending them even to [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] or [[mineral]] things.".<ref>Draper ''History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science'' pp. 154-155, 237</ref>

====Al-Jahiz and the struggle for existence====
The first Muslim biologist and philosopher to develop a theory of [[evolution]] was [[al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. He considered the effects of the environment on the likelihood of an animal to survive, and first described the [[The Origin of Species#Struggle for existence, and natural selection|struggle for existence]] and an early theory on [[natural selection]].<ref>Conway Zirkle (1941). Natural Selection before the "Origin of Species", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''84''' (1), p. 71-123.</ref><ref>Mehmet Bayrakdar (Third Quarter, 1983). "Al-Jahiz And the Rise of Biological Evolutionism", ''The Islamic Quarterly''. [[London]]. [http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/al-jahiz.php]</ref>

====Ibn Miskawayh and the Brethren of Purity====
[[Ibn Miskawayh]]'s ''al-Fawz al-Asghar'' and the [[Brethren of Purity]]'s ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'' (''The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa'') expressed evolutionary ideas on how species evolved from [[matter]], into [[vapor]], and then [[water]], then [[mineral]]s,  then [[plant]]s, then [[animal]]s, then [[ape]]s, and then [[human]]s.<ref>[[Muhammad Hamidullah]] and Afzal Iqbal (1993), ''The Emergence of Islam: Lectures on the Development of Islamic World-view, Intellectual Tradition and Polity'', p. 143-144. Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad.</ref><ref name=Hart>Eloise Hart, ''Pages of Medieval Mideastern History''. ([[cf.]] Isma'ili, Yezidi, Sufi, [http://www.ismaili.net/mirrors/Ikhwan_04/brotherpur.html The Brethren Of Purity], Ismaili Heritage Society)</ref>

====Other Muslim supporters====
The [[polymath]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] wrote a book in which he argued for [[evolutionism]] (although not natural selection), and numerous other Islamic scholars and scientists, such as [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], discussed and developed these ideas. Translated into [[Latin]], these works began to appear in the West after the [[Renaissance]] and appear to have had an impact on Western science.

== Modern period ==
===Early modern thought===
[[Image:BelonBirdSkel.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre Belon]] compared the skeletons of birds and humans in his ''Book of Birds'' (1555).]]
In [[17th century]] English the word ''evolution'' (from the Latin word "evolutio", meaning "unroll like a scroll") began to be used to refer to an orderly sequence of events, particularly one in which the outcome was somehow contained within it from the start. In [[1677]] Sir [[Matthew Hale]] used the term ''evolution'' in attacking the atheistic atomism of Democritus and Epicurus. Hale set out the atomist idea that vibrations and collisions of atoms in the void without divine intervention had formed "Primordial Seeds" (semina) which were the "immediate, primitive, productive Principles of Men, Animals, Birds and Fishes."<ref name="Goodrum2002">{{cite journal|last=Goodrum|first=|Matthew R.|title=Atomism, Atheism, and the Spontaneous Generation of Human Beings: The Debate over a Natural Origin of the First Humans in Seventeenth-Century Britain|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=63 No. 2|pages=207-224|date=April 2002}}</ref> He called this mechanism absurd because "it must have potentially at least the whole Systeme of Humane Nature, or at least that Ideal Principle or Configuration thereof, in the evolution whereof the complement and formation of the Humane Nature must consist. . . and all this drawn from a fortuitous coalition of senseless and dead Atoms."<ref name="Goodrum2002" /> Thus, among some ''[[evolutionism|evolutionist]]'' theories explored from [[1700]] to [[1850]], the earth, life, and universe developed without divine intervention. But most contemporary theories of evolution, including those developed by the German idealist philosophers [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Hegel]], held that evolution was a fundamentally spiritual process, with the entire course of natural and human evolution being "a self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute"<ref>Schelling, ''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800</ref>

Typically of these theorists, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in [[1714]] postulated "[[monad]]s" inside objects causing motion by internal forces, and maintained that "the 'germs' of all things have always existed . . . [and] contain within themselves an internal principle of development which drives them on through a vast series of metamorphoses" to become the geological formations, lifeforms, psychologies, and civilizations of the present. Leibniz clearly held that evolution proceeded on divine principles. In his ''De rerum originatione radicali'', 1697, he wrote that "A cumulative increase of the beauty and universal perfection of the works of God, a perpetual and unrestricted progress of the universe as a whole must be recognized, such that it advances to a higher state of cultivation."<ref> Lovejoy ''The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea'' p. 257</ref> Others including [[J. G. von Herder]] expressed similar ideas.<ref>Lovejoy pp. 183-184, 279-280, 369</ref> 

In his ''Venus Physique'' in [[1745]], and ''System of Nature'' in 1751, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] veered toward more materialistic ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations producing races and even new species. He also anticipated in general terms the idea of [[natural selection]].<ref> Bowler ''Evolution: The History of an Idea'' pp. 73-75</ref> 

Vague and general ideas of evolution continued to proliferate among the mid-eighteenth century philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. [[G. L. L. Buffon]] suggested that what most people referred to as species were just well-marked varieties. He thought that members of what were at the time considered to be the same genus, and which in terms of modern [[scientific classification]] would have been considered members of the same family, had all descended from a common ancestor. He believed that the common ancestor of each family had arisen through [[spontaneous generation]], and that environmental effects caused them to diverge into different species. Buffon's concept of evolution was strictly limited. He believed there were "internal moulds" that shaped the spontaneous generation of each family and that the families themselves were eternally distinct. Thus lions, tigers, leopards, pumas, and house cats could all share a common ancestor, but dogs and house cats could not.<ref>Bowler ''Evolution: The History of an Idea'' pp. 75-80</ref><ref>Larson Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory pp. 14-15</ref>  Although Darwin, in his foreword to the 6th edition of the ''[[Origin of Species]]'', credited [[Aristotle]] with foreshadowing the concept of [[natural selection]], he stated that "the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon".<ref> Darwin, Charles ''The Origin of Species'' p. 9</ref> 

The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in the [[Critique of Judgement]] ([[1792]]) presents what he refers to as “a daring venture of reason,” in which “one organic being [is] derived from another organic being, although from one which is specifically different; e.g., certain water-animals transform themselves gradually into marsh-animals and from these, after some generations, into land-animals.”<ref>Kant (1792) Section 80</ref>

Between [[1767]] and [[1792]] [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] included in his writings the concepts that man was derived from primates, and that creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals in response to their environment.  He also produced  research on the evolution of [[linguistics]], which was cited by Erasmus Darwin in his ''Temple of Nature'' in 1802.<ref> Darwin, Erasmus ''Temple of Nature'' p. 9</ref>. Jan-Andrew Henderson states that Monboddo was the first to articulate the theory of [[natural selection]].<ref> Henderson 2000</ref> 

Between [[1794]] and [[1796]] [[Erasmus Darwin]] wrote ''[[Zoönomia]]'' suggesting "that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament ... with the power of acquiring new parts"<ref>Darwin, Erasmus Zoonomania Vol I section XXXIX</ref> in response to stimuli, with each round of improvements being inherited by successive generations. In his ''Temple of Nature'' of [[1802]] he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in the mud to its modern diversity:

<blockquote>First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,<br />
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;<br />
These, as successive generations bloom,<br />
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume;<br />
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,<br />
And breathing realms of fin and feet and wing.<ref> Darwin, Erasmus ''Temple of Nature'' p. 15</ref><br /></blockquote>

===Early 19th century ===

====Emergence of paleontology and other developments in geology====
{{seealso|History of paleontology}}

In 1796 [[Georges Cuvier]] published his findings on the differences between living and [[fossil]] [[elephants]]. His analysis demonstrated that [[mammoths]] and [[mastodons]] were extinct species different from any living animal, effectively ending what had been a long running debate about whether a species could become extinct.<ref> Larson ''Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory'' p. 7</ref> [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] began the process of ordering [[rock strata]] by examining fossils in the layers while he worked on his geologic map of [[England]]. Independently, Georges Cuvier and [[Alexandre Brongniart]] published an influential study of the geologic history of the region around Paris in [[1811]], which was based on the [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] succession of layers of rock. This work helped establish the antiquity of the earth.<ref> Bowler p. 113</ref> Cuvier advocated [[catastrophism]] to explain the patterns of extinction and [[faunal succession]] revealed by the fossil record. Knowledge of the fossil record continued to advance rapidly in the first few decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s the outlines of the [[geologic timescale]] were becoming clear, and in 1841 [[John Phillips]] named three major eras based on the predominant fauna, the [[Paleozoic]] dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, [[Mesozoic]] the age of reptiles, and [[Cenozoic]] the age of mammals. Even conservative English geologists like [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[William Buckland]] accepted this progressive picture of the history of life, which, like Cuvier, they attributed to repeated catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation.<ref> Larson pp. 29-38</ref> Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other English geologists who were advocates [[natural theology]] made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode to the [[biblical flood]].<ref> Bowler pp. 115-116 </ref>

From 1830-1833 [[Charles Lyell]] published his multi-volume ''Principles of Geology'' which advocated a [[uniformitarianism (science)| uniformitarian]] theory of geology as an alternative to catastrophism. Lyell claimed that rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the earth could better be explained as the result of the same geologic forces that could be observed in the present day acting [[gradualism| gradually]] - but over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the consensus that the fossil record showed true progression), his concept of forces working gradually over an extended period to shape the earth, combined with the immense age of the earth assumed by his theories, would influence future evolutionary thinkers such as [[Charles Darwin]].<ref name="Bowler129-134"> Bowler pp. 129-134</ref>

====Lamarckism and the transmutation of species====
{{seealso|Lamarckism}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed in his ''Philosophie Zoologique'' of 1809 a theory of the transmutation of species. Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by [[spontaneous generation]]. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck also recognized that species were adapted to their environment. He explained this observation by saying that the same nervous fluid driving increasing complexity, also caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of that organ, just as muscles are affected by exercise. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that became closely associated with his name and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.<ref> Bowler pp. 86-94</ref><ref> Larson pp. 38-41</ref> 

A radical British school of comparative anatomy that included the surgeon [[Robert Knox]] and the [[anatomist]] [[Robert Edmund Grant| Robert Grant]] was closely in touch with Lamarck's school of French ''Transformationism'', which contained scientists such as [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. Grant developed Lamarck's and Erasmus Darwin's ideas of [[Transmutation of species|transmutation]] and [[evolutionism]], investigating [[homology (biology)|homology]] to prove [[common descent]]. As a young student [[Charles Darwin]] joined Grant in investigations of the life cycle of marine animals. He also studied geology under professor [[Robert Jameson]] who wrote an anonymous paper in [[1826]] praising "Mr. Lamarck" for explaining how the higher animals had "evolved" from the "simplest worms" – this was the first use of the word "evolved" in a modern sense. Jameson's course closed with lectures on the ''"Origin of the Species of Animals"''.<ref> Desmond and Moore ''Darwin:The Life of a Tormented Evolutionist'' p. 40</ref><ref name="Bowler120-129">Bowler pp. 120-129</ref>

The computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] published his unofficial ''Ninth [[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in [[1837]], putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required. In 1844 the Scottish publisher [[Robert Chambers]] anonymously published an influential, and extremely controversial book of popular science entitled ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for the origins of the solar system and life on earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals with current animals being branches off a main line that lead progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Robert Grant, but its implication that humans were just the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. Both conservatives like Adam Sedgwick, and radical materialists like [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], who disliked Chambers' implications of preordained progress, were able to find scientific inaccuracies in the book that they could disparage. However, the high profile of the public debate over ''Vestiges'', with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.<ref> Bowler pp. 134-138</ref><ref>Bowler and Morus ''Making Modern Science'' pp. 142-3</ref>

====Opposition to the transmutation of species====
Ideas about the transmutation of species were strongly associated with the radical materialism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and were greeted with hostility by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and [[Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by re-population, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his reputation as a leading scientist helped keep transmutational ideas out of the scientific mainstream for decades.<ref> Larson pp. 5-24</ref> 

In Britain, where the philosophy of [[natural theology]] remained influential, [[William Paley]] wrote the book ''Natural Theology'' with its famous [[watchmaker analogy]], at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]].<ref> Bowler pp. 103-104</ref> Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck and Grant, and Sedgwick wrote a famously harsh review of ''The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation''.<ref> Larson pp. 37-38</ref><ref> Bowler p. 138</ref> Although the geologist [[Charles Lyell]] opposed scriptural geology he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his ''Principles of Geology'' ([[1830]]-[[1833]]), criticized and dismissed Lamarck's theories of development. Instead, he advocated a form of progressive creation, in which each species had its "centre of creation" and was designed for this particular habitat, but would go extinct when this habitat changed.<ref name="Bowler129-134"/>

Another source of opposition to transmutation was a school of naturalists who were influenced by the German philosophers and naturalists associated with [[idealism]], such as [[Goethe]], [[Hegel]] and [[Lorenz Oken]]. Idealists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Richard Owen]] believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in [[embryology]], as well as in the fossil record: but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of "archetypes" in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as [[vertebrate]] limbs. Owen was concerned by the political implications of the ideas of transmutationists like Robert Grant, and he led a public campaign by conservatives that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. In his famous 1841 paper, which coined the term dinosaur for the giant reptiles discovered by Buckland and [[Gideon Mantell]], Owen argued that these reptiles contradicted the transmutational ideas of Lamarck because they were more sophisticated than the reptiles of the modern world. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, along with the controversy surrounding ''Vestiges'', would be major factors in his decision to delay publishing his ideas.<ref name="Bowler120-129"/><ref> Larson pp. 42-46</ref>

====Anticipations of Darwin's theory of natural selection====
Several writers anticipated aspects of Darwin's theory, and in the third edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' published in 1861 he named those he had learnt about in an introductory appendix, ''An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species'', which he added to in later editions.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1861|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F381&viewtype=text&pageseq=20 xiii]}}</ref>

In [[1813]], [[William Charles Wells]] read before the Royal Society essays assuming that there had been evolution of humans, and recognising the principle of [[natural selection]]. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were unaware of this work when they jointly published the theory in [[1858]], but Darwin later acknowledged that Wells had recognised the principle before them, writing that the paper "An Account of a White Female, part of whose Skin resembles that of a Negro" was published in 1818, and "he distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man, and to certain characters alone."<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1866|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F385&pageseq=21 xiv]]}}</ref> When Darwin was developing his theory, he was influenced by [[A.

[[Patrick Matthew]] wrote in the obscure book ''Naval Timber & Arboriculture'' that was published in [[1831]] of "continual balancing of life to circumstance. ... [The] progeny of the same parents, under great differences of circumstance, might, in several generations, even become distinct species, incapable of co-reproduction."<ref>{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Patrick|title=Nature's law of selection.

In the brief historical sketch that Darwin included in the 3rd addition he says "Unfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew very briefly in an Appendix to a work on a different subject ... He clearly saw, however, the full force of the principle of natural selection."<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1861|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F381&viewtype=text&pageseq=21 xiv]}}</ref>  

Although the pre-Darwinian writers invoked nearly every principle that Darwin or his successors have suggested, they seem to have failed to understand the implications of their own ideas. As an example, Matthew chose to relegate his idea on natural selection to the appendix of a work on an unrelated subject. More specifically, despite having enunciated the basic idea of natural selection, they either assumed that it was self-evidently true, or gave merely ''logical'' arguments for its importance and failed to provide any [[empirical]] data. In other words, the anticipations of Darwin were merely formal and verbal. As [[T. H. Huxley]] pointed out in his essay on the reception of the ''Origin of Species'':

<blockquote>
The suggestion that new species may result from the selective action of external conditions upon the variations from their specific type which individuals present and which we call spontaneous because we are ignorant of their causation is as wholly unknown to the historian of scientific ideas as it was to biological specialists before 1858. But that suggestion is the central idea of the ''Origin of Species'', and contains the quintessence of Darwinism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huxley|first=Thomas Henry|title=''The Reception of the Origin of Species'' |url=http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext00/oroos10.htm|publisher=Project Gutenberg|date=1895|accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref>

====Natural selection====
{{main|Inception of Darwin's theory|Development of Darwin's theory|Publication of Darwin's theory}}

The [[biogeography|biogeographical]] patterns Charles Darwin observed during [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the voyage of the Beagle]], in places such as the [[Galapagos islands]], caused him to doubt the fixity of species, and in [[1837]] Darwin started the first of a series of secret notebooks on [[Transmutation of species|transmutation]]. Darwin's observations lead him to view transmutation as a process of divergence and branching, rather than the ladder-like progression envisioned by Lamarck and others. In [[1838]] he read the new 6th edition of [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus']] ''Essay on the Principle of Population''. This book, combined with Darwin's knowledge on how breeders selected traits, led to the [[inception of Darwin's theory]] of [[natural selection]]. Concerned by the intense controversy raging over other transmutational ideas, Darwin would develop this idea in private for the next 20 years, sharing it only with a handful of friendly naturalists through correspondence.<ref> Bowler and Morus pp. 129-149</ref><ref> Larson pp. 55-71</ref>  

Unlike Darwin, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], influenced by the book ''Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation'', already believed that transmutation of species occurred when he began his career as a naturalist. By 1855 his biogeographical observations made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper that stated that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Once again it was consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that lead Wallace to conclusions very similar to the ones reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858 Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, wrote up his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint [[publication of Darwin's theory]] of natural selection with Wallace in July. Darwin also began work in earnest on ''The Origin of Species'', which he would publish in 1859.<ref> Bowler pp. 173-176</ref>

===1859-1930s: Darwin and after Darwin===
{{see also|reaction to Darwin's theory}}

While transmutation of species was accepted by a sizable number of scientists before [[1859]], it was the publication of Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' that fundamentally transformed the debate over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.<ref name="Larson79-111"> Larson pp. 79-111</ref> 

One of the first and most important naturalists to be convinced by ''Origin'' was the British anatomist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Lamarck and ''Vestiges'', Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the [[X-club]] to reform and professionalize science by displacing [[natural theology]] with [[methodological naturalism]], ending the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species.<ref name="Larson79-111"/> In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of [[Archaeopteryx]] in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence involved fossils that helped trace the [[evolution of the horse]] from its small five-toed ancestors.<ref> Larson pp. 139-40</ref> However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both [[August Weismann]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]] championed this idea: with Haeckel using evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain.<ref> Larson pp. 109-110 </ref>

Darwin's theory succeeded in profoundly shaking scientific opinion regarding the development of life and resulted in a small social revolution. However, this theory could not explain several critical components of the evolutionary process. Namely, Darwin was unable to explain the source of variation in traits within a species, and could not identify a mechanism that could pass traits faithfully from one generation to the next. Darwin's hypothesis of [[pangenesis]], while relying in part on the inheritance of acquired characteristics, proved to be useful for statistical models of evolution that were developed by his cousin [[Francis Galton]] and the "biometric" school of evolutionary thought. This idea was, however, of little use to biologists.

====Application of the theory to humans====
[[Image:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s frontispiece to ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' (1863).]]

Charles Darwin was aware of the severe reaction in some parts of the scientific community against the suggestion made in ''Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation'' that humans had arisen from animals by a process of transmutation. Therefore he almost completely ignored the topic of [[human evolution]] in ''The Origin of Species''. Despite this precaution, the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book's publication. For most of the first half of the 19th century the scientific community believed that, although geology had shown that the earth and life were very old, human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present. However, a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct animals. By the early 1860s, as summarized in Charles Lyell's 1863 book ''Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man'', it had become widely accepted that humans had existed during a prehistoric period - which stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history. This new view of human history was more compatible than the older one with an evolutionary origin for humanity. On the other hand, there was no fossil evidence of human evolution known at the time, since the only human fossils discovered prior to the very end of the 19th century were of anatomically modern humans, or of very similar [[Neanderthals]].<ref name="Bowler207-216"> Bowler pp. 207-216 </ref>

Therefore the debate that immediately followed the publication of ''The Origin of Species'' centered on the similarities and differences between humans and modern [[apes]]. Richard Owen vigorously defended the traditional classification, suggested by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] and Cuvier, that placed humans in a completely separate order from any of the other mammals. On the other hand, Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one very famous incident, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of [[gorillas]] lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book ''Evidence as to Man's place in Nature''. Another viewpoint was advocated by Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for some of the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.<ref name="Bowler207-216"/> 

In 1871 Darwin published ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'', which contained his views on human evolution. Darwin argued that the differences between the human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He believed that all the differences between humans and apes could be explained by a combination of the selective pressures resulting from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and [[sexual selection]]. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness would continue well into the 20th century.<ref name="Bowler207-216"/>

====Alternatives to natural selection - theistic evolution, orthogenesis, saltationism, and neo-Lamarckism====
[[Image:Titanothere Osborn.jpg|thumb|left|200px| This photo is from Henry Fairfield Osborn's 1918 book ''Origin and Evolution of Life'', and it shows models depicting the evolution of [[Titanothere]] horns over time, which Osborn claimed was an example of an orthogenic trend in evolution.]]
Evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles within a few years after the publication of ''Origin'', but the acceptance of [[natural selection]] as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. There were a variety of reasons for this. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to many naturalists because they felt it was immoral and left little room for [[teleology]] (purpose) or the concept of "progress" in the development of life. In addition, some felt that natural selection would be too slow, given the estimates of the age of the earth and sun (10-100 million years) being made by physicists such as [[Lord Kelvin]] at the time. Another objection was that natural selection could not work because at the time the models for inheritance involved blending of inherited characteristics. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century, were [[theistic evolution]], [[neo-Lamarckism]], [[orthogenesis]], and [[saltationism]].<ref name="Larson105-129"> Larson pp. 105-129</ref><ref name="Bowler196-250"> Bowler pp. 196-253</ref> 

Theistic evolution was the idea that a [[God]] intervened in the process of evolution to guide it in such a way that the living world could still be considered to be designed. Some of its advocates included [[Asa Gray]], [[George Jackson Mivart]], and the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyle]]. However, this idea rapidly fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of [[methodological naturalism]] and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive and a form of [[special pleading]]. By 1900 it had completely disappeared from mainstream scientific discussions, although it continued to be used as a way to reconcile religious belief with scientific discoveries among non-scientists.<ref name="Larson105-129"/><ref name="Bowler196-250"/>

The term Lamarckism was used for the idea that characteristics acquired during the course of an organism's life, such as changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular organ, could be inherited by the next generation. Although Wallace completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, Darwin had included it in the first edition of ''The Origin of Species'' as a possible supplemental mechanism of evolution. In the late 19th century the term [[neo-Lamarckism]] came to be associated with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], and the American paleontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. The idea of linear progress was also an important part of Haeckel's [[recapitulation theory]] of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history.<ref name="Larson105-129"/><ref name="Bowler196-250"/>  

Critics of neo-Lamarckism pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The experimental work of the German biologist [[August Weismann]] resulted in the [[germ plasm theory]] of inheritance. This led him to declare that this mechanism was flatly impossible, since the [[Weismann barrier]] would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.<ref name="Larson105-129"/><ref name="Bowler196-250"/> 

Orthogenesis or orthogenetic evolution was the [[hypothesis]] that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the [[19th century]], and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo Berg, and the American paleontologist [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. Orthogenesis was particularly popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual and constant unidirectional change.  Those who accepted this idea, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed). The orthogenesis hypothesis began to collapse when it became clear that it could not explain the patterns found by [[paleontology|paleontologists]] in the [[fossil record]], which were non-linear and contained many complications.  A few hung on to the orthogenesis hypothesis as late as the [[1950s]] by claiming that the processes of [[macroevolution]], the long term trends in evolution, were distinct from the processes of [[microevolution]].<ref name="Larson105-129"/><ref name="Bowler196-250"/>

Saltationism was the idea that new species arise as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was very popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo DeVries]], [[William Bateson]], and early in his career, [[T. H. Morgan]]. This later became the basis of the [[mutation theory]] of evolution.<ref name="Larson105-129"/><ref name="Bowler196-250"/>

====The Mendelian-biometrician debates and the nature of variation====
The rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the [[Mendelian]]s, who were focused on discrete variations and the laws of inheritance. They were led by [[William Bateson]] (who coined the word [[genetics]]) and [[Hugo de Vries]] (who coined the word [[mutation]]). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon]], followed in the tradition of [[Francis Galton]] - who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics because they felt that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in wild populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from environmental factors really could shift the range of variation in real world populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species.<ref name="Bowler256-273"> Bowler pp. 256-273</ref><ref name="Larson153-174"> Larson pp. 153-174</ref> 

When [[T. H. Morgan]] began experimenting with breeding the fruit fly [[Drosophila melanogaster]] he was a saltationist who hoped to demonstrate that a new species could be created in the lab by mutation alone. Instead, the work at his lab between 1910 and 1915 reconfirmed Mendelian genetics and provided solid experimental evidence linking it to chromosomal inheritance. It also demonstrated that most mutations had relatively small affects (such as a change in eye color), and that rather than creating a new species in a single step, they served to increase variation within the existing population.<ref name="Bowler256-273"/><ref name="Larson153-174"/>

===1920s-1940s: Population genetics and the modern evolutionary synthesis===
{{main|Modern evolutionary synthesis}}
[[Image:Biston.betularia.7200.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''Biston betularia f. typica'', the white-bodied [[peppered moth]].]]
[[Image:Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''Biston betularia f. carbonaria'', the black-bodied peppered moth.]]
Eventually, the Mendelian and biometrician models were reconciled and merged during the development of the discipline of [[population genetics]]. A key part of this development was the work of the British biologist and statistician [[R.A. Fisher]]. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book ''Genetical Theory of Natural Selection'' Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that [[natural selection]] could change [[gene frequencies]] in a population, driving evolution. In a series of papers starting in 1924 another British geneticist, [[J.B.S. Haldane]], applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the [[Peppered moth evolution|evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths]], and showed that natural selection worked at a faster rate than even Fisher had thought possible. The American biologist [[Sewall Wright]], who had a background in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, and the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations that exhibited [[genetic drift]]. In 1932 Wright inroduced the concept of an [[adaptive landscape]] and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small isolated sub-populations away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane, and Wright founded the discipline of [[population genetics]], which integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics.<ref name="Bowler325-339">Bowler pp. 325-339</ref><ref name="Larson221-243">Larson pp. 221-243</ref>     

In the first couple of decades of the 20th century most field naturalists continued to believe that Lamarckian and orthogenic mechanisms of evolution provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. However, as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] had been a postdoctoral worker in T. H. Morgan's lab and had been influenced by the work on genetic diversity done by [[Russian]] geneticists such as [[Sergei Chetverikov]]. He would help to bridge the divide between the population geneticists and the field biologists with his 1937 book ''Genetics and the origin of species''. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations, and showed that contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into more accessible form. [[Ernst Mayr]] was influenced by the work of the [[Germany|German]] biologist [[Bernhard Rensch]] on how local environmental factors influenced the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book ''Systematics and the Origin of Species'', which emphasized the importance of [[allopatric speciation]] in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for [[reproductive isolation]]. Mayr also formulated the [[biological species concept]] that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations. In the 1944 book ''Mode and Tempo in Evolution'' [[George Gaylord Simpson]] showed that the fossil record was consistent with the irregular non-directional pattern predicted by the developing evolutionary synthesis, and that the linear trends that earlier paleontologists had claimed supported orthogenesis and neo-Lamarckism did not hold up to closer examination. In 1950 [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] published ''[[Variation and Evolution in Plants]]'', which helped integrate [[botany]] into the synthesis. The emerging cross-discipline consensus on how evolution worked would be known as the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. It received its name from the book ''Evolution: the modern synthesis'' by [[Julian Huxley]].<ref name="Bowler325-339"/><ref name="Larson221-243"/><ref> Mayr and Provine (1998) pp. 33-34, 297-298, 416 </ref>

===1940s-1960s: Developments following from molecular biology===
{{main|History of molecular evolution}}

In the 1940s, following up on [[Griffith's experiment]] on [[transformation (genetics)|bacterial transformation]], [[Oswald Avery|Avery]], [[Colin MacLeod|MacLeod]] and [[Maclyn McCarty|McCarty]] definitively identified [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)]] as the [[transforming principle]] responsible for transmitting genetic information.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Avery O, MacLeod C, McCarty M |title=Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types.

Accessed 13 Feb 2007.</ref> These developments ignited the era of [[molecular biology]] and transformed the understanding of evolution into a molecular process: the mutation of segments of DNA.

During this era of [[molecular biology]], it also became clear that a major mechanism for variation within a population is [[mutagenesis|mutations]] of [[DNA]]. 
In the mid-1970s, [[Motoo Kimura]] formulated the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], firmly establishing the importance of [[genetic drift]] as a major mechanism of evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kimura M |title=Preponderance of synonymous changes as evidence for the neutral theory of molecular evolution |journal=Nature |volume=267 |issue=5608 |pages=275–6 |year=1977 |pmid=865622}}</ref> The theory sparked the "neutralist-selectionist" debate, partially solved by the development of [[Tomoko Ohta]]'s [[nearly neutral theory of evolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/246096a0| volume = 246| issue = 5428| pages = 96-98| last = Ohta| first = Tomoko| title = Slightly Deleterious Mutant Substitutions in Evolution| journal = Nature| date = 1973-11-09|}}</ref>

===Developments since the 1960s:===
====Gene centered view of evolution and other theoretic developments====
In the mid-1960s, [[George C. Williams]] strongly critiqued verbal explanations of adaptations couched in terms of "survival of the species" (essentially [[group selection]] arguments).  Such explanations were largely replaced by a [[gene-centered view of evolution]], epitomised by the [[kin selection]] arguments of [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[George R. Price]] and [[John Maynard Smith]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mayr E |title=The objects of selection |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/94/6/2091 |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=2091&ndash;94 |year=1997 |pmid=9122151}}</ref> Models of the period showed that [[group selection]] was severely limited in its strength, although these models have since been shown to be too limited and newer models do admit the possibility of significant multi-level selection.<ref name=Gould>{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Gulliver's further travels: the necessity and difficulty of a hierarchical theory of selection |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=9533127 |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=307&ndash;14 |year=1998 |pmid=9533127}}</ref>

In 1973 [[Leigh Van Valen]] proposed the term [[Red Queen]], which he took from ''[[Through the Looking Glass]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]], to describe a scenario where a species involved in one or more [[evolutionary arms race]]s would have to constantly change just to keep pace with the species it was [[co-evolving]] with. Hamilton, Williams and others suggested that this idea might help explain the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]], because the increased genetic diversity caused by sexual reproduction would help maintain resistence against rapidly evolving parasites. They felt this might explain why sexual reproduction was so common despite the tremendous cost from the gene-centric point of view of a system where only half of an organism's [[genome]] is passed on during reproduction.<ref> Larson p. 279</ref><ref> Bowler p. 358</ref> The gene-centric view has also led to an increased interest in Darwin's old idea of [[sexual selection]],<ref> Bowler pp. 358-359</ref> and  more recently in topics such as [[sexual conflict]] and [[intragenomic conflict]].

====Punctuated equilibrium====
One of the most prominent debates arising during this time period was over the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], a theory propounded by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] to account for the pattern of fossil species persisting phenotypically unchanged for long periods (what they termed ''stasis''), with relatively brief periods of phenotypic change during speciation.<ref name=pe1972>Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould, 1972.

====Sociobiology====
W. D. Hamilton's work on kin selection also contributed to the emergence of the discipline of [[sociobiology]]. [[Altruism]] has been a difficult problem for evolutionary theorists going all the way back to Darwin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sachs J |title=Cooperation within and among species |journal=J. Evol.

Wilson]] published the influential and highly controversial book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' which claimed evolutionary theory could help explain many aspects of animal, including human, behavior. Critics of sociobiology, including Stephen Jay Gould, and [[Richard Lewontin]], claimed that sociobiology greatly overstated the degree to which complex human behaviors could be determined by genetic factors. They also claimed that the theories of sociobiologists often reflected their own ideological biases. Despite these criticisms, work in sociobiology and the related discipline of [[evolutionary psychology]], including work on other aspects of the altruism problem, has continued.<ref> Larson pp. 270-278</ref><ref> Bowler pp. 359-361</ref>

====Advances in understanding evolutionary paths and processes====

====Microbiology and horizontal gene transfer====
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}

[[Microbiology]] has just recently developed into an evolutionary discipline. It was originally ignored due to the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst [[prokaryote]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gevers D, Cohan FM, Lawrence JG, ''et al'' |title=Opinion: Re-evaluating prokaryotic species |journal=Nat.

One particularly important outcome from studies on microbial evolution was the discovery in Japan of [[horizontal gene transfer]] in 1959.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ochiai K, Yamanaka T, Kimura K Sawada O |title=Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains |journal=Hihon Iji Shimpor |volume=1861 |pages=34 |year=1959}} (in Japanese)</ref> This transfer of genetic material between different species of bacteria has played a major role in the propagation of [[antibiotic resistance]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lateral gene transfer and the nature of bacterial innovation|url=http://www.stat.rice.edu/~mathbio/Ochman2000.pdf|publisher=Nature Vol 405, May 18 2000|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> More recently, as knowledge of [[genome]]s has continued to expand, it has been suggested that lateral transfer of genetic material has played an important role in the evolution of all organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de la Cruz F, Davies J |title=Horizontal gene transfer and the origin of species: lessons from bacteria |journal=Trends Microbiol. |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=128–33 |year=2000 |pmid=10707066}}</ref> Indeed, as part of the [[endosymbiotic theory]] for the origin of [[organelle]]s, horizontal gene transfer has been a critical step in the evolution of eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poole A, Penny D |title=Evaluating hypotheses for the origin of eukaryotes |journal=Bioessays |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=74–84 |year=2007 |pmid=17187354}}</ref><ref name=Dyall>{{cite journal |author=Dyall S, Brown M, Johnson P |title=Ancient invasions: from endosymbionts to organelles |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5668 |pages=253&ndash;7 |year=2004 |pmid=15073369}}</ref>

====Evo-devo====
{{main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

In the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] the tenets of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] came under increasing scrutiny.  There was a renewal of [[structuralism|structuralist]] themes in evolutionary biology in the work of biologists such as [[Brian Goodwin]] and [[Stuart Kauffman]], which incorporated ideas from [[cybernetics]] and [[systems theory]], and emphasized the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] processes of development as factors directing the course of evolution. The evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] revived earlier ideas of [[heterochrony]], alterations in the relative rates of developmental processes over the course of evolution, to account for the generation of novel forms, and, with the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lewontin]], wrote an influential paper in 1979 suggesting that a change in one biological structure could arise incidentally as an accidental result of selection on another structure, rather than through direct selection for that particular adaptation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=The exaptive excellence of spandrels as a term and prototype |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=94 |issue=20 |pages=10750–5 |year=1997 |pmid=11038582 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11038582}}</ref>  

Molecular data regarding the mechanisms underlying [[developmental biology|development]] accumulated rapidly during the 1980's and '90's. For example, it became clear that the diversity of animal morphology was not the result of different sets of proteins regulating the development of different animals, but from changes in the deployment of a small set of proteins that were common to all animals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=True JR, Carroll SB |title=Gene co-option in physiological and morphological evolution |journal=Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. |volume=18 |issue= |pages=53–80 |year=2002 |pmid=12142278}}</ref> These proteins became known as the [[Evolutionary developmental biology#The developmental-genetic toolkit|"developmental toolkit"]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cañestro C, Yokoi H, Postlethwait JH |title=Evolutionary developmental biology and genomics |journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=932–942 |year=2007 |pmid=18007650}}</ref> These various perspectives came to inform the disciplines of [[phylogenetics]], [[paleontology]] and comparative developmental biology, spawning the new discipline of "evo-devo."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baguñà J, Garcia-Fernàndez J |title=Evo-Devo: the long and winding road |url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper.php?doi=14756346 |journal=Int. J. Dev. Biol. |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=705–13 |year=2003 |pmid=14756346}}<br />*{{cite journal |author=Gilbert SF |title=The morphogenesis of evolutionary developmental biology |journal=Int. J. Dev. Biol. |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=467–77 |year=2003 |pmid=14756322}}</ref>

More recent work in this field has emphasized [[phenotypic plasticity|phenotypic and developmental plasticity]].  It has been hypothesized, for example, that the rapid emergence of basic metazoan body plans in the [[Cambrian Explosion]] was due in part to changes in the environment acting on inherent material properties of cell aggregates, such as differential cell adhesion and biochemical oscillation.  The resulting forms were later “locked in” by means of stabilizing natural selection.  Experimental and theoretical research on these and related ideas has been presented in the multi-authored volume [[Origination of Organismal Form]].

==Unconventional extensions to evolutionary ideas==
===Gaia hypothesis===
{{main|Gaia hypothesis}}
[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] formulated theories describing the gradual development of the Universe from subatomic particles to human society, considered by Teilhard as the last stage (see [[Gaia theory]]), but his ideas were not accepted by the scientific community. However, this hypothesis was later developed in a more limited and rigorous form by [[James Lovelock]], who proposed that the living and nonliving parts of Earth can be viewed as a complex interacting system with similarity to a single organism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lovelock J |title=Gaia: the living Earth |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6968 |pages=769–70 |year=2003 |pmid=14685210}}</ref> This modified hypothesis postulates that all living things have a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that promotes life overall. Although not fully-accepted by the scientific community, this hypothesis has been a useful spur to further research and is the centre of current scientific debate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Free A, Barton NH |title=Do evolution and ecology need the Gaia hypothesis? |journal=Trends Ecol Evol |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2007 |pmid=17954000}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lenton TM |title=Gaia and natural selection |journal=Nature |volume=394 |issue=6692 |pages=439–47 |year=1998 |pmid=9697767}}</ref>
