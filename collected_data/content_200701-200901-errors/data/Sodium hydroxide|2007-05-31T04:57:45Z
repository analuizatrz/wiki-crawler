'''Sodium hydroxide''' ([[sodium|Na]][[hydroxide|OH]]), also known as '''lye''' or '''caustic soda''', is a [[caustic (substance)|caustic]] metallic [[Base (chemistry)|base]]. Forming a strongly [[alkaline]] solution when dissolved in a solvent such as water, caustic soda is widely used in many industries, mostly as a strong [[chemical compound|chemical]] [[pH|base]] in the manufacture of [[pulp]] and [[paper]], [[textile]]s, [[drinking water]], [[soap]]s and [[detergent]]s. Worldwide production in 1998 was around 45 million [[tonne]]s.  Sodium hydroxide is also the most common base used in chemical laboratories, and it is also widely used as a [[drain cleaner]].

== General properties ==

Pure sodium hydroxide is a white solid; available in pellets, flakes, granules, and also 50% saturated solution. It is  [[deliquescent]] and also readily absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] from the air, so it should be stored in an [[Hermetically sealed|airtight]] container. It is very soluble in water with liberation of heat. It also dissolves in [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]], though it exhibits lower solubility in these solvents than does [[potassium hydroxide]]. It is insoluble in [[diethyl ether|ether]] and other non-polar solvents. A sodium hydroxide [[solution]] will leave a yellow stain on fabric and paper.

== Chemical properties ==

Sodium hydroxide is completely [[Ionic bonding|ionic]], containing sodium ions and [[hydroxide]] ions.  The hydroxide ion makes sodium hydroxide a strong base which reacts with acids to form [[water]] and the corresponding salts, e.g., with [[hydrochloric acid]], [[sodium chloride]] is formed:

:NaOH([[Aqueous|aq]])  +  [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]](aq)  →  [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]](aq)  +  [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]([[Liquid|l]])

In general such [[neutralization]] reactions are represented by one simple net ionic equation:

:[[Hydroxide|OH<sup>&minus;</sup>]](aq)  +  [[Hydronium|H<sup>+</sup>(aq)]]  →  H<sub>2</sub>O

This type of reaction [[exothermic reaction|releases heat]] when a strong acid is used.  Such [[acid-base reaction]]s can also be used for [[titration]]s, and indeed this is a common way for measuring the concentration of acids.  
Related to this is the reaction of sodium hydroxide with acidic oxides. The reaction of [[carbon dioxide]] has already been mentioned, but other acidic oxides such as [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) also react completely.  Such reactions are often used to "scrub" harmful acidic gases (like SO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S) and prevent their release into the atmosphere.

:2NaOH  +  [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]  →  [[Sodium carbonate|Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]]  +  H<sub>2</sub>O

Sodium hydroxide slowly reacts with glass to form [[sodium silicate]], so glass joints and [[stopcock]]s exposed to NaOH have a tendency to "freeze".  [[Laboratory flask|Flask]]s and glass-lined [[chemical reactor]]s are damaged by long exposure to hot sodium hydroxide, and the glass becomes frosted. Sodium hydroxide does not attack [[iron]] or [[copper]], but many other metals such as [[aluminium]], [[zinc]] and [[titanium]] are attacked rapidly. In 1986 an aluminium [[tank truck|road tanker]] in the UK was mistakenly used to transport 25% sodium hydroxide solution, causing pressurisation of the contents and damage to the tanker. For this same reason aluminium pans should never be cleaned with lye.

:2[[Aluminium|Al]]([[Solid|s]])  +  6NaOH(aq)  →  3[[Hydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]]([[Gas|g]]) +  2Na<sub>3</sub>AlO<sub>3</sub>(aq)

Many non-metals also react with sodium hydroxide, giving salts. For example [[phosphorus]] forms [[sodium hypophosphite]], while [[silicon]] gives [[sodium silicate]].  

Unlike NaOH, the hydroxides of most metals are insoluble, and therefore sodium hydroxide can be used to precipitate metal hydroxides. One such hydroxide is [[aluminium hydroxide]], used as a gelatinous [[flocculation|floc]] to filter out particulate matter in [[water treatment]]. Aluminium hydroxide is prepared at the treatment plant from [[aluminium sulfate]] by reaction with NaOH:

:6NaOH(aq)   +  [[Aluminium sulfate|Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]](aq)  →  2[[Aluminium hydroxide|Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>]](s)  +  3[[Sodium sulfate|Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]](aq)

Sodium hydroxide reacts readily with [[carboxylic acid]]s to form their salts, and it is even a strong enough base to form salts with [[phenol]]s. NaOH can also be used for the base-driven [[hydrolysis]] of [[ester]]s (as is [[saponification]]), [[amide]]s and [[alkyl halide]]s. However, the limited solubility of NaOH in organic solvents means that the more [[soluble]] [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] is often preferred.

== Manufacture ==
In 1998, total world production was around 45 million [[tonne]]s.  Of this, both North America and Asia contributed around 14 million tonnes, and Europe produced around 10 million tonnes.

=== Methods of production===
Sodium hydroxide is produced (along with [[chlorine]] and [[hydrogen]]) via the [[chloralkali process]].  This involves the [[electrolysis]] of an aqueous solution of [[sodium chloride]]. The sodium hydroxide builds up at the [[cathode]], where water is reduced to hydrogen gas and [[hydroxide]] ion: 

:2Na<sup>+</sup> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + 2e<sup>−</sup> → H<sub>2</sub> + 2NaOH

To produce NaOH it is necessary to prevent reaction of the NaOH  with the [[chlorine]].  This is typically done in one of three ways, of which the membrane cell process is economically the most viable.
* '''Mercury cell process''' (also called the [[Castner-Kellner process]]) &ndash; [[Sodium|sodium metal]] forms as an [[amalgam]] at a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[cathode]]; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce NaOH.  There have been concerns about mercury releases, although modern plants claim to be safe in this regard. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/animations/mercury-cell.asp| title=Chlorine Online Diagram of mercury cell process| publisher=Euro Chlor| accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref>
* '''Diaphragm cell process''' &ndash; uses a steel cathode, and reaction of NaOH with Cl<sub>2</sub> is prevented using a porous [[diaphragm seal|diaphragm]]. In the diaphragm cell process the anode area is separated from the cathode area by a permeable diaphragm. The brine is introduced into the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm into the cathode compartment. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The caustic soda must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of caustic soda. The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/makingchlorine| title=Euro Chlor - How is chlorine made?| publisher=Euro Chlor| accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/animations/diaphragm-cell.asp| title=Chlorine Online Diagram of diaphragm cell process| publisher=Euro Chlor| accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref>
* '''Membrane cell process''' &ndash; similar to the diaphragm cell process, with a [[Nafion]] membrane to separate the cathode and anode reactions. Only sodium ions and a little water pass through the membrane. It produces a higher quality of NaOH. Of the three processes, the membrane cell process requires the lowest consumption of electric energy and the amount of steam needed for concentration of the caustic is relatively small (less than one tonne per tonne of caustic soda). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/animations/membrane-cell.asp| title=Chlorine Online Diagram of membrane cell process| publisher=Euro Chlor| accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/makingchlorine| title=Euro Chlor - How is chlorine made?| publisher=Euro Chlor| accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref> 

An older method for sodium hydroxide production was the [[LeBlanc process]], which produced [[sodium carbonate]], followed by roasting to create [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sodium oxide]]. This method is still occasionally used.  It helped to establish sodium hydroxide as an important commodity chemical.

=== Major producers ===
In the United States, the major producer of sodium hydroxide is the [[Dow Chemical Company]], which has annual production around 3.7 million [[tonne]]s from sites at [[Freeport, Texas]], and [[Plaquemine, Louisiana]].  Other major US producers include [[Oxychem]], [[PPG Industries|PPG]], [[Olin Corporation|Olin]], Pioneer Companies, Inc. (PIONA), and [[Formosa Plastics Group|Formosa]]. All of these companies use the [[chloralkali process]]<ref>See ''Kirk-Othmer'' in general references</ref>.

== Uses ==
=== General applications ===
Sodium hydroxide is the principal strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] used in the chemical industry. In bulk it is most often handled as an [[aqueous]] [[solution]], since solutions are cheaper and easier to handle.  It is used to drive for chemical reactions and also for the [[neutralization]] of acidic materials. It can be used also as a neutralizing agent in petroleum refining

===Gold pennies===
Sodium hydroxide has also been used in conjunction with [[zinc]] for creation of the famous "Gold pennies" experiment.  When a [[penny]] is boiled in a solution of NaOH together with some granular [[zinc]] metal ([[Hot-dip galvanizing|galvanised nails]] are one source), the colour of the penny will turn silver in about 45 seconds. The penny is then held in the flame of a burner for a few seconds and it turns golden. The reason this happens is that granular [[zinc]] dissolves in NaOH to form Zn(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. This zincate ion becomes reduced to metallic [[zinc]] on the surface of a [[copper]] penny. [[Zinc]] and [[copper]] when heated in a flame form [[brass]].

=== Use in chemical analysis ===
In [[analytical chemistry]], sodium hydroxide solutions are often used to measure the [[concentration]] of acids by [[titration]].  Since NaOH is not a [[primary standard]], solutions must first be standardised by titration against a standard such as [[Potassium hydrogen phthalate|KHP]].  [[Burette]]s exposed to NaOH should be rinsed out immediately after use to prevent "freezing" of the stopcock.  Sodium hydroxide was traditionally used to test for [[cation]]s in [[Qualitative inorganic analysis|Qualitative Inorganic Analysis]], as well as to provide alkaline media for some reactions that need it, such as the [[Biuret]] test.

=== Soap making ===
Soap making ([[cold process]] soap, [[saponification]]) is the most traditional chemical process using sodium hydroxide. The [[Arab]]s began producing soap in this way in the 7th century, and the same basic process is still used today.

=== Biodiesel ===
For the manufacture of [[biodiesel]], sodium hydroxide is used as a [[catalyst]] for the [[transesterification]] of methanol and triglycerides. This only works with [[anhydrous]] sodium hydroxide, because water and lye would turn the fat into [[soap]] which would be tainted with [[methanol]].

It is used more often than potassium hydroxide because it costs less, and a smaller quantity is needed for the same results. Another alternative is [[sodium silicate]].

=== Aluminium etching ===
Strong bases attack [[aluminium]]. This can be useful in etching through a resist or in converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further [[passivation]] such as [[anodizing]] or [[allodizing]] the surface may become corroded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.

=== Food preparation ===
Food uses of lye include washing or chemical peeling of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], [[chocolate]] and [[cocoa]] processing, [[caramel]] color production, [[poultry]] scalding, [[soft drink]] processing, and thickening [[ice cream]]. [[Olive]]s are often soaked in lye to soften them, while [[pretzel]]s and [[Germany|German]] [[lye roll]]s are glazed with a lye solution before baking to make them crisp. 

Specific foods processed with lye include:
* The [[Scandinavia]]n delicacy known as [[lutefisk]] (from ''lutfisk'', "lye fish").
* [[Hominy]] is dried [[maize]] (corn) kernels reconstituted by soaking in lye-water. These expand considerably in size and may be further processed by cooking in hot oil and salting to form [[corn nuts]]. [[Nixtamal]] is similar, but uses [[calcium hydroxide]] instead of sodium hydroxide.
* [[Hominy]] is also known in some areas of the Southeastern United States, as the breakfast food [[grits]], dried and ground into a coarse powder. They are prepared by boiling in water, with the addition of butter and other ingredient to suit the tastes of the preparer.
* Sodium hydroxide is also the chemical that causes gelling of egg whites in the production of [[Century egg]]s.
* German pretzels are poached in a boiling sodium hydroxide solution before baking, which contributes to their unique crust.

=== Delignification of Cellulosic Materials ===

Sodium Hydroxide, in addition to Sodium Sulfide, is a key component of the white liquor solution used to separate lignin from cellulose fibers in the [[Kraft process]]. It also plays a key role in several following stages of the process of bleaching the brown pulp resulting from the pulping process. These stages include oxygen delignification, oxidative extraction, and simple extraction, all of which require a strong alkaline environment with a pH > 10.5 at the end of the stages.

=== Domestic uses ===
Sodium hydroxide is used in the home as an agent for unblocking drains, provided as a dry crystal (e.g. "[[Drāno]]") or as a thick liquid gel. The chemical mechanism employed is the conversion of grease to a form of [[soap]], and so forming a water soluble form to be dissolved by flushing; also decomposing complex molecules such as the [[protein]] of [[hair]]. Such '''drain cleaners''' (and their [[acid|acidic]] versions) are highly caustic and should be handled with care.

Beginning in the early 1900s, lye has been used to [[Relaxer|relax]] or straighten the hair of persons of African ethnicity. Among men, this treatment was often called a process.  However, because of the high incidence and intensity of chemical burns, chemical relaxer manufacturers began switching to other alkaline chemicals (most commonly [[guanidine hydroxide]]) during the latter quarter of the 20th Century, although lye relaxers are still available, usually under use by professionals.

=== Tissue Digestion ===
This is a process that was used with farm animals at one time. This process involves the placing of a carcass into a sealed chamber, which then puts the carcass in a mixture of lye and water, which breaks chemical bonds keeping the body intact. This eventually turns the body into a coffee-like liquid, and the only solid remains are bone hulls, which could be crushed between one's fingertips. It is also of note that sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing [[roadkill]] dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. 

Sodium hydroxide has also been used by criminals and [[serial killer]]s to dispose of their victim's bodies.

=== Illegal drugs ===
Sodium hydroxide is a key reagent in the process of making [[Methamphetamine]] and other illegal drugs. Contrary to popular media reports, it is not actually an "ingredient" in these drugs, but simply a strong base used to manipulate the pH at various points in a chemical synthesis.

== Safety ==
Solid sodium hydroxide or solutions containing high concentrations of sodium hydroxide may cause [[chemical burn]]s, permanent injury or scarring, and [[blindness]].

Solvation of sodium hydroxide is highly exothermic, and the resulting heat may cause heat burns or ignite flammables.  

The combination of aluminium and sodium hydroxide results in a large production of hydrogen gas:<br>
2[[Aluminium|Al]]([[Solid|s]])  +  6NaOH(aq)  →  3[[Hydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]]([[Gas|g]]) +  2Na<sub>3</sub>AlO<sub>3</sub>(aq). <br>
Mixing these two in a closed container is therefore dangerous.

For more information, consulting an [[MSDS]] is suggested.

== Trivia ==
{{trivia}}
* The danger of chemical burns was shown in a scene of the 1999 movie [[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]], where the character Tyler Durden puts it on the protagonist's freshly kissed hand to create a lip-shaped scar, symbolizing their commitment to the plan that makes up the movie's plot. This is subsequently [[neutralization|neutralized]] by [[vinegar]] ([[acetic acid]]). 
* Lye is used as an assault weapon in an episode of US crime drama [[CSI: NY]], in which the victim has the chemical thrown over his face, causing a [[chemical burn]], and his eventual death.
* Lye is used as a murder weapon in the US crime drama [[Law and Order: CI]] in an episode entitled "The Saint." It is put into a gift box, and when the elderly victim opened it, it flies up into her face, killing her.
