'''Paramore''' is a [[pop punk]] band from [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. The band consists of [[lead vocalist]] Hayley Williams, [[lead guitarist]] Josh Farro, [[bassist]] Jeremy Davis and [[drummer]] Zac Farro and [[guitar]]ist Taylor York.

== History ==
The Franklin, Tennessee-based band Paramore was formed by five members: brothers Zac and Josh Farro, Hunter Lamb, Jeremy Davis and Hayley Williams. At the age of 13, Williams moved from her hometown of [[Meridian, Mississippi]] to the Nashville suburb, where she met the brothers. Over the following years, Paramore performed at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]]. In April 2005 the band was signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]].

Paramore was featured on the Shira Girl Stage of the 2005 Warped Tour. In January of 2006 they were a part of the Winter Go West Tour where they played alongside Seattle bands Amber Pacific and The Lashes. In the Spring of 2006 they were an opening act on the headlining tours for Bayside and then The Rocket Summer. During the summer of 2006, Paramore played a portion of Warped Tour again, primarily on the Volcom and Hurley Stages. Their first night on the Main Stage was at their hometown show of Nashville.

Paramore's first United States headlining tour began on [[August 2]], [[2006]] with support from Becky Coates, [[This Providence]], [[Cute Is What We Aim For]], and [[Hit the Lights (band)|Hit the Lights]] with the final show in Nashville, Tennessee. They also toured the United Kingdom from [[October 5]], [[2006]] to [[October 15]], [[2006]], where they ended in London at The [[Mean Fiddler]].

Paramore covered [[Foo Fighters]]' "My Hero" for the ''[[Sound of Superman]]'' soundtrack, and Williams' voice has been featured on two tracks by other bands: "Keep Dreaming Upside Down" by [[October Fall]], as well as "Then Came To Kill" by [[The Chariot (band)|The Chariot]].

Paramore recorded their second album, ''[[RIOT!]]'', from December 2006 to March 2007, which was released June 2007. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number 20 and the UK charts at number 24.

On March 12, 2007, Paramore announced through a [[LiveJournal]] update that Hunter Lamb had left the band to be with his fiancée. Hunter has been temporarily replaced by close friend of Josh, Taylor York, to help them with their performances on the [[Warped Tour]].
