The '''École Polytechnique Massacre''', also known as the '''Montreal Massacre''', occurred on [[December 6]] [[1989]], at the [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. A 25 year-old man, [[Marc Lépine]], entered the campus and carried out a shooting rampage in which 14 women were killed and <!-- Most websources including media reports say 13, but a careful check of the coroner's report indicates that there were 14 wounded. Please see http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf and confirm it for yourself!-->4 men and 10 women were wounded, before turning the rifle on himself and committing suicide.<ref name="coroner"> Sourour, Teresa K., (1991) [http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf Report of Coroner's Investigation] Retrieved on [[2006-12-28]]</ref>  

==The massacre==
Sometime after 4 p.m. on [[December 6]] [[1989]], Marc Lépine arrived at the École Polytechnique building, an engineering school affiliated with the [[Université de Montréal]], armed with a [[semi-automatic rifle]] and a [[hunting knife]].<ref name="coroner"/> He had purchased the [[Sturm, Ruger]] brand rifle, [[Mini-14]] model, on [[November 21]] [[1989]] in a Montreal hunting store, telling the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game.<ref>{{cite news|last =Weston| first =Greg| title =Why? We may never know| publisher =Toronto Sun| date = [[2006-09-14]]| url =http://www.torontosun.com/News/Columnists/Weston_Greg/2006/09/14/1837880.html| accessdate =2006-12-31}}</ref> Lépine was familiar with the layout of the building since he had been in and around the École Polytechnique at least seven times  in the weeks leading up to the event.<br />

Lépine sat for a time in the office of the registrar on the second floor, seated at the entrance. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office, and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about 60 students at about 5:10 p.m.<ref name="coroner"/> <br /> After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it was a joke, until he fired a shot into the ceiling.<ref>{{cite web| title =Gunman massacres 14 women| work =Archives| publisher =CBC| date =6 December 1989| url =http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-70-398-2235/disasters_tragedies/montreal_massacre/clip1| format =video stream| accessdate = 2006-12-29}}</ref>

Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and told the men to leave, which they did.<ref name="cernea">{{cite book| last =Cernea| first =Adrian| title =Poly 1989: Témoin de l'horreur| publisher =Éditions Lescop| date =1999||id = ISBN 2-9804832-8-1}}</ref> He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied “no,” he answered: “I am fighting feminism.” One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, "Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life." Lépine responded, "You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists."  Lépine then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six and wounding three others, including Provost.<ref name="coroner"/><ref name="Chun">{{cite journal| last =Chun| first =Wendy Hui Kyong| title =Unbearable Witness: towards a Politics of Listening | journal =Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies | volume =11| issue =1| pages =112-149| date =1999}}</ref>Before leaving the room, he wrote the word "shit" twice on a student project.<ref name="cernea"/>

Lépine continued into the second floor corridor and wounded three students, before entering another room and attempting twice to shoot a female student. His weapon failed to fire, so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun by another student. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door and Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office, where he shot and killed a woman through a door window as she moved away after locking the door.<br /> 

Next, he went down to the first floor cafeteria, in which about 100 people were gathered. The crowd scattered after he fired shots, killing a woman standing near the kitchens and wounding another student. Entering an unlocked storage area at the end of the cafeteria, he shot and killed two women there. Lépine told a male student and a female student to come out from hiding under a table; they complied and were not shot.<br /> 

Lépine then walked up an escalator to the third floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to "get out," shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair who also on the low platform at the front of the classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two students who were trying to escape the room. Other students dived under their desks, and Lépine moved towards women students, firing and wounding three students and killing one. He changed the magazine in his weapon, and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help and, after unsheathing his hunting knife, Lépine stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed "Oh, shit," then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, 20 minutes after having begun his attack. About 60 bullets remained in the boxes he had carried with him. He had killed 14 women in total (12 engineering students, 1 nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured 14 <!-- NB most web and news reports state 13 wounded, but the coroner's report indicates several times that actually 14 were wounded. http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf! -->other people including four men.<ref name="coroner"/>

==Suicide Letter==
Marc Lépine's inside jacket pocket contained a suicide letter and two letters to friends, all dated the day of the massacre.<ref name="coroner"/> Some details were revealed by the police two days after the event,<ref>{{cite news| last =Malarek| first =Victor| title =More Massacre Details to be Released by Police, but an Inquiry Ruled Out| publisher =Globe and Mail| date =12 December 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Malarek|first =Victor| title =Killer's letter blames feminists| publisher =Globe and Mail |date = [[1989-12-08]]}}</ref> but the full text was not disclosed. A year after the attacks, Marc Lépine's three page statement was leaked to [[journalist]] and [[feminist]] [[Francine Pelletier (journalist)|Francine Pelletier]]. It contained a list of 19 Québec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because he considered them feminists.<ref>{{cite web| title =A Difficult Story to Tell| work =The Story of the fifth estate| publisher =CBC News | url =http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/history/difficultfour.html | accessdate =2006-12-28}}</ref> The list included Pelletier herself, as well as a union leader, a politician, a TV personality and six police officers who had come to Lépine's attention because they were on a volleyball team together.<ref>{{cite news | last =Fitterman| first =Lisa| title =Cops on Lepine's list: Names of six female officers found on Polytechnique killer| publisher =The Gazette| date =[[1999-03-10]]}}</ref> The letter (without the list of women) was subsequently published in the ''[[La Presse]]'' newspaper, where Pelletier was a columnist at the time.<ref>{{cite news | last =Pelchat| first =Martin| title =Lépine avait des motifs "politiques"| language =French| publisher =La Presse| date =24 November 1990}}</ref> Lépine wrote that he considered himself rational and that he blamed feminists for ruining his life.  He outlined his reasons for the attack including his anger at the women's movement itself and related social changes through which women were seizing the "advantages" of men.<ref name="citynews">{{cite news| title =CityNews Rewind: The Montreal Massacre| publisher =City News| date =December 6, 2006 | url =http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_5897.aspx| accessdate = 2006-12-28}}</ref> He also mentioned [[Denis Lortie]], who killed three government employees and wounded 13 others in an armed attack on the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] in May 1984.<ref name="Eglin">{{cite book| last =Eglin| first =Peter| coauthors =Stephen Hester| title =The Montreal Massacre: A Story of Membership Categorization Analysis| publisher =Wilfred Laurier University Press| date =2003| location =Waterloo, ON| pages =58| id = ISBN 0-88920-422-5}}</ref>

The following is a translation of the suicide letter written by Lépine on the day of the shooting.<ref name="Malette">Malette, L. and Chalouh, M. The Montreal Massacre, Gynergy Books, 1991.</ref>
The  [[wikisource:fr:Lettre de suicide de Marc Lépine|original French letter]] is also available. 
<blockquote>
Forgive the mistakes, I had 15 minutes to write this. See also Annex.<br/><br/>Would you note that if I commit suicide today 89-12-06 it is not for economic reasons (for I have waited until I exhausted all my financial means, even refusing jobs) but for political reasons. Because I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to their Maker. For seven years life has brought me no joy and being totally blase, I have decided to put an end to those viragos.<br /><br />

I tried in my youth to enter the Forces as a student-officer, which would have allowed me possibly to get into the arsenal and precede Lortie in a raid. They refused me because antisocial (sic). I therefore had to wait until this day to execute my plans. In between, I continued my studies in a haphazard way for they never really interested me, knowing in advance my fate. Which did not prevent me from obtaining very good marks despite my theory of not handing in work and the lack of studying before exams.<br /><br />

Even if the Mad Killer epithet will be attributed to me by the media, I consider myself a rational erudite that only the arrival of the Grim Reaper has forced to take extreme acts. For why persevere to exist if it is only to please the government. Being rather backward-looking by nature (except for science), the feminists have always enraged me. They want to keep the advantages of women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended maternity leave preceded by a preventative leave, etc.) while seizing for themselves those of men.<br /><br />

Thus it is an obvious truth that if the Olympic Games removed the Men-Women distinction, there would be Women only in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting to remove that barrier. They are so opportunistic they neglect to profit from the knowledge accumulated by men through the ages. They always try to misrepresent them every time they can. Thus, the other day, I heard they were honoring the Canadian men and women who fought at the frontline during the world wars. How can you explain then that women were not authorized to go to the frontline??? Will we hear of Caesar's female legions and female galley slaves who of course took up 50 per cent of the ranks of history, though they never existed. A real Casus Belli.<br /><br />

Sorry for this too brief letter.<br /><br />

Marc Lepine

</blockquote>

The letter is followed by the 19 name list, with a note at the bottom:

<blockquote>

"Nearly died today. The lack of time (because I started too late) has allowed these radical feminists to survive. <br />Alea Jacta Est."

==Marc Lépine==
{{main|Marc Lépine}}
Marc Lépine was born Gamil Gharbi to a French-Canadian mother and an Algerian father. Marc's father  did not consider women to be the equal of men. He was physically and verbally abusive to his wife and son and discouraged tenderness between mother and child.<ref name="mother">{{cite news | last =CTV.ca News Staff|title =Mother of Marc Lepine finally breaks her silence |publisher =CTV| date =2006-09-25| url =http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20060925/lepine_mother_060925/20060925/?hub=Canada&subhub=PrintStory| accessdate = 2007-01-01}}</ref> When Gamil was seven his parents separated and he lived with his mother. He attempted to join the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian army]] during the winter of 1980-1, but was rejected, according to his suicide letter, because he was "anti-social."

==Aftermath==
Having briefed reporters outside, [[Service de police de la Ville de Montréal|Montreal Police]] director of public relations Pierre Leclair entered the building  and found his daughter Maryse's stabbed body.<ref name="macleans">{{cite news | last =Came| first =Barry| coauthors =Burke, D, Ferzoco, G. , O'Farreli, B , Wallace, B| title = Montreal Massacre: Railing Against Feminists| publisher = Maclean's Magazine | date =[[1989-12-18]]| url= http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/macleans.html| accessdate = 2007-01-04}}</ref><ref name="funeral">{{cite news | last =Mennie| first =James| coauthors = and Bauch, Hubert| title = A quiet goodbye for slain women| publisher = The Gazette, Montreal | date =[[1989-12-12]]}}</ref> <br />
The massacre profoundly shocked citizens across [[Canada]]. The Québec government and the Montréal city government declared three days of mourning.<ref name="macleans"/> <br />

A joint funeral for nine of the women was held at [[Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica]] on [[December 11]] [[1989]], and was attended by Canadian Governor-General [[Jeanne Sauvé]], Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]], Quebec premier [[Robert Bourassa]] and Montreal Mayor Jean Doré and thousands of other mourners.<ref name="funeral"/><br /> 
Male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings,<ref name="cernea"/> but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.<ref>{{cite news| last =Kastor| first =Elizabeth| title =In Montreal, A Survivor Heals After The Horror; 23-Year-Old Student Tried To Reason With Killer| publisher =The Washington Post| date =11 December 1989}}</ref><br />
An extensive police investigation into Marc Lépine and the killings took place.<ref>{{cite news | last =Canadian Press | title = Police scour the life of mass killer| publisher = Edmonton Journal| date =[[1990-01-12]]}}</ref> The 98-page police report was not made public but a copy was given to the coroner who used it as a source in her investigation.<ref>{{cite news| last =Poirier| first =Patricia| title =Police can't find cause for Lepine's rampage on Montreal campus| publisher =Globe and Mail| date =1 March 1990}}</ref><ref name="coroner"/>

==Search for a rationale==
The gender of Marc Lépine's victims as well as his oral statements during the massacre and suicide note quickly led to the event being seen as a [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] attack and as a example of the wider issue of violence against women.<ref name="Eglin"/>  His mother later wondered if the attack wasn't directed at her, as some would have considered her a feminist as she was a single, working mother.<ref name="mother"/><br />
Others, including television journalist [[Barbara Frum]] questioned why people insisted on "diminishing" the tragedy by "suggesting that it was an act against just one group?"<ref>{{cite web| last =Ruddy | first =Jenny| coauthors =Elizabeth Curry| title =Barbara Frum, quoted in Reframing violence against women| work =The Commonwealth| publisher =Saskatchewan New Democrat Party|date =December 2004| url =http://www.saskndp.com/cw/64.5/reframingviolencewomen.html|accessdate = 2006-12-29}}</ref>  <br />
As predicted by Marc Lépine in his suicide letter,<ref name="citynews"/> others saw the event as the isolated act of a madman.<ref name="Eglin"/><ref name="Chun"/>  As part of the police investigation, a psychiatrist interviewed Lépine's family and friends and examined his writings. He noted that Marc Lépine defined suicide as his  primary motivation, and that he chose a specific suicide strategy: killing one’s self after killing others (multiple homicide/suicide strategy).  This strategy is known to be a characteristic of individuals who have a serious personality disorder.<ref name="coroner"/>  Other psychiatrists emphasized the traumatic events of his childhood, noting the possibility that the blows he received may have caused brain damage. Another suggested that he might have been psychotic, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (and absent) father, while at the same time unconsciously identifying with a violent manhood that dominates women. Yet another speculated that Lépine's experiences of abuse as a child led him feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life.<ref>{{cite news  | last =Lortie | first = Marie-Claude |title = Poly un an après : Psychose? Blessures au cerveau? Les spécialistes n'ont pas encore résolu l'énigme Marc Lépine |publisher =La Presse| date =[[1990-12-01]]}}</ref><br />
Some developed a more social analysis, seeing Lépine's actions as the result of societal changes leading to increasing poverty, powerlessness and individual isolation.<ref>{{cite news  | last =Valpy | first = Michael |title = Litany of social ills created Marc Lepine |publisher =The Globe and Mail| date =[[1989-12-11]]}}</ref> Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, others have suggested that increasing violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions.<ref name="cernea"/><br />
Following the shootings at [[Dawson College]] in September 2006,  [[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]] columnist [[Jan Wong]] [[Jan Wong controversy|controversially suggested]] that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.<ref>{{cite news  | last =Wong | first =Jan |title = Get under the desk |publisher =The Globe and Mail| date =[[2006-09-16]]| http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060915.wxshooting-main16/BNStory/National/home| accessdate = 2007-01-20}}</ref>

==Long-term impact==
The injured and witnesses among university staff and students suffered a variety of physical, psychological, social, existential and financial consequences, including post-traumatic stress syndrome. A number of students committed suicide of whom at least two noted in their suicide notes that their anguish following the massacre was the reason for their suicides. Nine years after the event, survivors reported still being affected by their experiences, though with time some of the effects had lessened.<ref>{{cite journal| last =Parent| first =G  | coauthors =Cousineau, M| title =Conséquences à long terme d'un ''mass murder'' :le cas de Polytechnique, neuf ans plus tard| journal =The International Journal Of Victimology| volume =1| issue =3| date =2003| url =http://www.jidv.com/PARENT,G-JIDV2003-1-(3).htm| accessdate =2006-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Ha| first =Tu Thanh| coauthors = Ingrid Peritz| title =When the snowflakes start to fall, we all remember| publisher =Globe and Mail| date =4 December 1999| url =http://pete.uri.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9912a&L=wsse-cur&D=0&T=0&P=571 | accessdate =2006-12-31}}</ref><br />[[Image:6decembre.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Place du 6-Décembre-1989.]]
The massacre was a major spur for the Canadian gun control movement. One of the survivors, Heidi Rathjen, who was in one of the classrooms Marc Lépine did not enter during the shooting, organized the Coalition for Gun Control with Wendy Cukier.<ref name="Dec6"/>  Also heavily involved in gun control issues were Susan and Jim Edwards, the parents of one of the victims.<ref>{{cite news | last =Boyd| first =Denny| title =Couple salvages purpose from their daughter's tragic death| publisher =The Vancouver Sun| date =April 20, 1992}}</ref> Their activities, along with others, led to the passage of Bill C-68, or the Firearms Act, in 1995, ushering in stricter gun control regulations.<ref name="Dec6"/> (See [[Gun politics in Canada]]).<br />
In response to the killings a House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Women was struck. It released a report "The War against Women" in June 1991.<ref>{{cite news | last =Vienneau| first =David| title =Probe on violence toward women blocked| publisher =Toronto Star| date =[[1991-01-19]]}}</ref>  As a result of its recommendations, the federal government established the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women in August 1991. The panel issued its final report, "Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence – Achieving Equality", in June 1993.<ref>{{cite web| last =Harder| first = Sandra | title = Violence against women: the Canadian Panel's final report | publisher = Government of Canada | url =http://dsp-psd.communication.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/MR/mr122-e.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-03 }}</ref>
Police response to the shootings was heavily criticized for the amount of time it gave Lépine to carry out the massacre. The first police officers to arrive at the scene established a perimeter around the building and waited before entering the building. During this period, several women were killed.<ref>{{cite news | last =Sheppard| first =Robert| title =A sea change in police tactics when it comes to gunmen| publisher =CBC News| date =September 15, 2006| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/realitycheck/sheppard/20060915.html | accessdate = 2006-12-29 }}</ref>  Subsequent changes to emergency response protocols led to praise of emergency responders' handling of the [[Dawson College shooting]] in 2006 in which one woman was killed by a lone gunman. In that incident, coordination amongst emergency response agencies and prompt intervention was credited with minimizing the loss of life.<ref>{{cite news | last =Rakobowchuk| first =Peter| title =Lessons learned from 1989 Montreal massacre help save lives at Dawson college| publisher =Canadian Press| date =September 14, 2006| url =http://www.canada.com/topics/news/features/dawsonshooting/story.html?id=93749783-4392-4539-80aa-7085c9a58e74&k=4497|accessdate = 2006-12-28}}</ref><br />

==Memorials==
The anniversary of the massacre has been marked since 1991 as the [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]], intended as a call to action against discrimination against women.<ref>{{cite news | last =Fitzpatrick| first =Meagan| title =National day of remembrance pays tribute to victims of Montreal massacre| publisher =CanWest News Service| date =December 6, 2006 | url =http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=dcb98c06-2c4f-46f1-bc6f-6a147308a252&k=33060| accessdate =  2006-12-27}}</ref> Each year, commemorative demonstrations are held on December 6 across the country in memory of the slain women.
