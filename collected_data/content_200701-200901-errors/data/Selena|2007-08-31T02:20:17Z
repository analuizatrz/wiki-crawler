'''Selena Quintanilla-Pérez''' ([[April 16]] [[1971]] – [[March 31]] [[1995]]), best known as '''Selena''', was a [[Mexican American]] [[singer]] who has been called "the queen of [[Tejano music]]".<ref name="queen">Mitchell, Rick.

She took the award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987 at the [[Tejano Music Awards]] and landed a recording contract with [[EMI]] a few years later. Her fame continued to grow throughout the early 1990s, especially in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries. Her album ''[[Selena Live!]]'' won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican-American Album]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1994|36th Grammy Awards]], and her 1994 album ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' was nominated for another Grammy and produced four number one Spanish hits.

Selena attained further notability in [[North America]] after [[Yolanda Saldívar]], the president of her fan club, murdered her at the age of 23. On [[April 12]] [[1995]], two weeks after her death, [[George W. Bush]], then the [[List of Governors of Texas|governor of Texas]], declared her birthday "Selena Day" in Texas.<ref name="rolemodel">Orozco, Cynthia E.

She began singing at the age of six; when she was nine her father founded the singing group ''[[Selena y Los Dinos]]'', which she fronted. They initially performed at the Quintanilla family's restaurant, "Papagallos," but the restaurant failed shortly afterwards.<ref name="rolemodel" />

The family soon went bankrupt and was evicted from their home. Taking all their musical equipment in an old bus, they relocated to [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] in Southern Texas. There, they performed wherever they could: at street corners, weddings, ''[[quinceañera]]s'', and fairs.<ref name="Gale">[http://www.gale.com/free_resources/chh/bio/selena.htm Selena.] ''Thompson Gale'' (Gale.com). Retrieved on [[June 6]] [[2006]].</ref> These efforts at spreading their name paid off in 1984 when Selena, then twelve years old, recorded her first album for a local record company. The album was not sold in stores, and her father bought all the original copies. It was later re-released in 1995 under the title ''[[Mis Primeras Grabaciones]]''.  Selena did well in school, but as she grew more popular, the travel demands of her performance schedule began to interfere with her education. Her father pulled her out of school altogether when she was in eighth grade.<ref name="queen" /> She continued her education on the road; at age seventeen she earned a high school diploma from [[The American School of Correspondence]] in [[Chicago]]. Selena released her second album, ''[[Alpha (Selena album)|Alpha]]'', in 1986.

At the [[Tejano Music Awards]] in 1987, Selena took the award for Best Female Vocalist (and would continue to dominate the Award for the next seven years).<ref name="TejanoAward">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/16/earlyshow/leisure/music/main525834.shtml "Fans, Family Remember Selena".] CBSNews.com, [[October 17]] [[2002]].

In 1989, [[José Behar]], the former head of the Sony Latin Music division, signed Selena with Capitol/EMI records, a record company he had founded. He later said that the reason he signed Selena was because he thought he had discovered the next [[Gloria Estéfan]].<ref name="queen" /> Selena signed a contract with [[Coca-Cola]] to become one of their spokespersons the same year,<ref name="rolemodel" /> and her concerts were drawing thousands of people.

In 1988, Selena met [[Chris Perez]], who had his own band. Two years later, the Quintanilla family hired him to play in Selena's band and they quickly fell in love. At first her father didn't approve of the relationship between Perez and Selena, and went as far as firing Perez from the band. He eventually came to accept the relationship, telling Selena that Perez could come back only if they married and moved next door to the family home.<ref name="Married">Patoski, Joe Nick.

In 1990 Selena released another album, ''[[Ven Conmigo]]'', written by her main songwriter and brother [[A.B. Quintanilla|Abraham Quintanilla, III]]. This recording was the first Tejano album ever to achieve gold status. Around the same time, a registered nurse and fan named Yolanda Saldívar approached Selena's father with the idea of starting a fan club. Her wish was granted, and she became the club's president; later she would become the manager of Selena's clothing boutiques.<ref name="Gale" /> Selena released another hit album in 1992, ''[[Entre A Mi Mundo]]'', which also achieved gold status.<ref name="Gold"> [http://www.who2.com/selena.html Selena Pop Musician.] Who2.com. Retrieved on [[June 5]] [[2006]].]</ref> Songs from that album, such as "[[Como La Flor]]", helped make Selena a star. Her 1993 ''Live'' album won a Grammy award for Best Mexican-American Performance.

Selena released her next album, ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'', in 1994. The album was nominated for another Grammy award for Mexican-American Album of the Year. She began designing and manufacturing a clothing line in 1994, and opened two boutiques called Selena Etc., one in Corpus Christi and the other in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. Both were equipped with their own in-house beauty salons. ''[[Hispanic Business]]'' magazine reported that the singer earned over five million dollars from these boutiques.<ref name="Fivemillion">[http://www.caller.com/ccct/home/article/0,1641,CCCT_800_3654650,00.html "Selena - Life Events".] ''Corpus Christi Caller Times'', [[March 27]] [[2005]].  Retrieved on [[June 7]] [[2006]].</ref> Selena also made appearances alongside [[Erik Estrada]] in a Latin [[soap opera]] titled ''[[Dos Mujeres, Un Camino]]''.<ref name="Gale" />

Selena and her band continued to receive accolades; Billboard's [[Premio Lo Nuestro]] awarded them a total of six prestigious awards, including Best Latin artist and song of the year for ''Como La Flor.'' Coca-Cola released a commemorative bottle in her honor to celebrate their five-year relationship. Meanwhile, her duet with the [[Barrio Boyzz]], "Dondequiera Que Estes", raced to the top of the Latin charts. This prompted Selena to tour in [[New York City]], [[Argentina]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Central America]], where she was in growing demand. The duet with [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] singer [[Alvaro Torres]], "Buenos Amigos", was also a hit.

[[Image:Selena 9.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Selena on the cover of ''Amor Prohibido'']]
By fall of 1994, ''Amor Prohibido'' was a commercial success in Mexico and made four number-one Latin hits, replacing Gloria Estefan's "Mi Tierra" on the chart's number one spot. It sold over 400,000 copies by March of 1995, reaching gold status.<ref name="Gale" /> At this point, Selena developed plans to record an [[English language|English]]-language album, but continued to tour for ''Amor Prohibido'' while beginning preparations for the album.

In 1995, Selena made a [[cameo appearance]] in the romantic comedy ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'', which starred [[Marlon Brando]], [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Faye Dunaway]]; she appeared as a background [[mariachi]] singer during the first scene. In February 1995, Selena played a concert at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in the [[Houston Astrodome]], which attracted over 61,000 fans—more than country stars such as [[George Strait]], [[Vince Gill]] and [[Reba McEntire]].<ref name="rolemodel" /> Despite her busy schedule, Selena visited local schools to talk to students about the importance of education. She also donated her time to civic organizations such as [[D.A.R.E.]], and planned a fundraising concert to help [[AIDS]] patients. These demonstrations of community involvement won her loyalty from her fan base.<ref name="vh1"> [http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/selena/bio.jhtml Selena.] VH1.com.

Afraid that her fans would think she was turning her back on them, she was working on a new Tejano album as well. Meanwhile, she planned to open two more boutiques, including one in [[Monterrey]], Mexico.

==Death==
In early 1995, the Quintanillas discovered that [[Yolanda Saldívar]], the president of Selena's fan club and the manager of her boutiques, was stealing money from the boutiques and decided to fire her. Soon after the fallout, Selena agreed to meet Saldívar in a [[Days Inn]] hotel in Corpus Christi<ref name="DaysInn"> [http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/metropolitan/selena/transcripts/95/10/13/param.html "Testimony of Richard Fredrickson"] ''Houston Chronicle'', [[October 13]] [[1995]].
