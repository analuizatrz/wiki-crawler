'''Gene Rayburn''' ([[December 22]], [[1917]] &ndash; [[November 29]], [[1999]]) was an American [[radio]] and [[television]] personality.  Born '''Eugene Rubessa''' ({{pronounced|ruˈbeʃɑ}}) and an only child of [[Croatia]]n immigrants, he graduated from [[Knox College]]. 

Rayburn was married to Helen Ticknor from [[1940]] until her death in October [[1996]]. They had one child, a daughter, Lynn.  After the birth of their child, Rayburn was drafted into the [[U.S. Air Force]].

He chose his stage name by randomly pointing at a page in the telephone book, after being told ''Rubessa'' sounded "too [[Italian language|Italian]]". 

==Television career==
Before appearing in television, Rayburn was a very successful actor and radio performer. He had a popular morning-drive [[New York, New York|New York]] radio show, first with [[Jack Lescoulie]] (''Anything Goes'') and later with Dee Finch (Rayburn & Finch) on WNEW-AM (now [[WBBR)]]. Radio history pegs Rayburn's pairings with Lescoulie and Finch as the first two-man teams in morning radio. When Rayburn left WNEW, Dee Finch continued the format with Gene Klavan.

He also landed the lead in the Broadway musical [[Bye Bye Birdie]] after [[Dick Van Dyke]] left the production to star in the classic sitcom which bears his name.  

Breaking into television as the original announcer on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', he eventually appeared as a panelist on the quiz show ''[[The Name's the Same]]''. Rayburn once hosted a local New York City-based show on [[WNEW-TV]] (now WNYW), ''[[Helluva Town]],'' and years later he would return to WNEW-TV as the host of ''Saturday Morning Live'' in the 1980s.

In [[1955]], he took over as host of the summer replacement game show, ''[[Make the Connection]]'', from original host, [[Jim McKay]]. From there he hosted shows such as ''[[Choose Up Sides]]'', ''[[Dough Re Mi]]'', and ''[[Tic Tac Dough]]''. On radio, Rayburn became one of the many hosts of the popular NBC program ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'' in [[1961]] and remained with the show until [[1973]].

In an uncredited role (he reportedly did not want his name to appear), Rayburn played a TV interviewer in the [[1959]] movie, ''[[It Happened to Jane]]'' starring [[Doris Day]]. His involvement was mentioned on an episode of ''[[Match Game|Match Game '77]]''.

During the [[1960s]], he occasionally substituted for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''. In [[1967]], Carson made a surprise appearance on the original black-and-white version of ''The Match Game'' during the same week that ''Tonight'' announcer [[Ed McMahon]] was a guest celebrity. In [[1973]], Rayburn recalled his guest-hosting duties as "the hardest job" he ever had.

Rayburn was also a frequent panelist in the 1960s and 70s on ''[[What's My Line]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]],'' where the interviewing skills he burnished on ''Monitor'' made him a popular questioner.

==''The Match Game''==
In [[1962]] Rayburn first hosted ''[[Match Game|The Match Game]]''. The original version, which aired on [[NBC]], lasted until [[1969]]. The show returned to [[CBS]] in [[1973]] with a new format in which contestants had to match celebrity answers to humorous "fill-in-the-blank" questions. Millions tuned in and it soon became the highest-rated show in daytime television history. 

From [[1973]] to [[1977]], it was #1 among all daytime network game shows -- three of those years the highest rated in ALL of daytime -- fueled mostly by the zany questions and Rayburn's witty style. His interaction with the panel and contestants and his antics, including breaking through the entrance doors, roller-skating on stage and climbing the audience, made the show a classic.  

The daytime revival of ''The Match Game'', which featured regular panelists [[Richard Dawson]], [[Brett Somers]] and [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], ran until [[1979]] on CBS and another three years in first-run syndication until [[1982]], with a concurrent night-time version, ''Match Game PM'', airing from [[1975]] to [[1981]]. Rayburn was nominated for two [[Daytime Emmy Awards]] for Outstanding Host or Hostess in a Game or Audience Participation Show.

During the years when ''The Match Game'' was taped in Los Angeles, Rayburn lived in [[Osterville, Massachusetts]] on [[Cape Cod]], and would commute to California every two weeks to tape 12 shows over the course of a weekend (five daytime shows and one nighttime show per taping day).

In [[1983]], a year after the syndicated ''Match Game'' disappeared,  the show was revived as part of the ''[[Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour]]'', with Rayburn hosting the Match Game segment and sitting on the panel of the ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' segment. The show lasted nine months on NBC.

===Facts and moments===
{{Trivia|date=October 2007}}
Perhaps, one of the most famous ''Match Game'' moments came during a taping in [[1974]] he unintentionally told a contestant, Karen Lesko, that she had "pretty nipples", meaning to say "dimples." The incident was cut from the original CBS episode and is not shown in [[Game Show Network|GSN]] reruns either.  Nonetheless, it has come to be known as possibly the most embarrassing "host screw-up" in game show history. The moment has been aired on several present-day TV specials regarding game show mishaps.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

In an episode of the syndicated version of the show, he asked a contestant if a yellow star on her shoulder were a symbol of "communism."  She denied it, and the show continued.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

He knitted socks as a publicity stunt during his time on ''Rayburn and Finch'' and later became avid in needlepoint, so much to the point that he would constantly do some in plane rides from [[New York]] to ''Match Game'' tapings in [[Hollywood]]. In a [[1974]] ''Match Game'' episode, program packager [[Mark Goodson]] made a surprise visit to congratulate the host on making the show #1 among daytime television programs and Goodson gave Rayburn a needlepoint bag as a gift. In a later episode that year, panelist Richard Dawson showed off a picture of Gene knitting socks as part of the aforementioned publicity stunt.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

Being of Croatian ancestry, Rayburn could also speak the language. On one Match Game episode, when a contestant with the same ancestry would appear on the show, Rayburn would exchange a few words in Croatian with them.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

From [[1978]] up until Rayburn's death, he never spoke with ''Match Game'' regular panelist [[Richard Dawson]]. Dawson was a popular celebrity panel member who enjoyed joking around with the rest of the crew, yet in late [[1977]] until the summer of 1978, he appeared less interested in the game, probably due to the fact that he was hosting his own new hit game show, ''[[Family Feud]]''. Years later, Rayburn recalled that Dawson was in later years, a "loner...with a monumental ego" who was "trying to kill the show."{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Other game shows/television appearances==
During and between his ''Match Game'' years, Rayburn served as guest panelist on two other [[Mark Goodson|Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman|Todman]] shows, ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', where he exhibited the same inquisitiveness on serious subjects he showed on ''Monitor''. Three years after the original ''Match Game'' was cancelled, Rayburn hosted the short-lived [[Heatter-Quigley Productions]] show, ''The Amateur's Guide to Love'' ([[1972]]). He also hosted a pilot for [[Reg Grundy Productions]] in 1983 called ''Party Line'', which later became ''[[Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak]]'' (which first aired in 1986 and was cancelled after 13 weeks).

Rayburn appeared as a contestant during the Game Show Hosts Week of [[Card Sharks]].

Rayburn appeared on ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' as a game-show host -- he and another host were game show rivals who wanted to do the ultimate game show to win the woman they both loved; Roarke accommodated them with a game-show set, but the host's chair was more like a throne, and death was a real possibility. In the end, the two men, in a dead heat, were offered a final tie-breaker, a "sudden death" round.

In between game show stints in 1982-83, Rayburn hosted a weekly local talk/lifestyles show seen live on [[WNEW-TV]] in [[New York City]] called ''[[Saturday Morning Live]]''.  His tenure was brief when he ultimately accepted the hosting assignment for ''[[The Match Game/Hollywood Squares Hour]]''.

The final game shows Rayburn emceed were: a [[1985]] revival of ''[[Break the Bank]]'', where Rayburn was fired after 13 weeks and replaced by Joe Farago, and ''[[The Movie Masters]]'', an [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] [[cable]] game show that ran from [[1989]] to [[1990]].

Right before production was to begin on a new Rayburn-emceed ''Match Game'' revival in [[1985]], an ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' reporter publicly disclosed his age, which was much older than many people believed. Rayburn had trouble finding jobs after that, blaming the reporter for disclosing his age and subjecting him to [[ageism|age discrimination]]. 

Rayburn portrayed himself on a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch in [[1990]], which featured [[Susan Lucci]] (as her character from ''[[All My Children]]'', [[Erica Kane]].) He returned as one of Kane's previous husbands (alluding to Erica Kane's many marriages during her stint on that show), stopping another marriage with the host of a game show portrayed by [[Phil Hartman]].

==Death==

Rayburn's last TV appearance was a [[1998]] interview with ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' intended to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the CBS ''Match Game''. Portions of the interview have been re-shown on the [[Game Show Network]] which in [[2001]] showed portions of another previously unaired interview during the first airing of its ''Match Game Blankathon''.

Rayburn died at his daughter's home of [[congestive heart failure]] in 1999, one month after receiving a Lifetime Achievement award from the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]].
