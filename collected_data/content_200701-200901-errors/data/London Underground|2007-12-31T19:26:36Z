The '''London Underground''' is a railway system - also known as a [[rapid transit system]] - that serves a large part of [[Greater London]], [[United Kingdom]] and some neighbouring areas. It is the world's oldest underground system, and is one of the longest in terms of route length. Services began on [[10th January]] [[1863]] on the [[Metropolitan Railway]]; most of the initial route is now part of the [[Hammersmith & City line]].<ref name="history">{{ cite web | title = History | publisher = Transport for London | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1604.aspx | accessdate = 2007-03-31 }}</ref> Despite its name, about 55% of the network is above ground. Popular local names include '''the Underground''' and, more colloquially, '''the Tube''', in reference to the cylindrical shape of the system's deep-bore tunnels.

The Underground has 275 [[metro station|stations]] and runs over 253&nbsp;miles (408&nbsp;km) of line<ref name="facts">{{ cite web | title = Key facts | publisher = Transport for London | url = http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1608.aspx | accessdate =2007-03-31 }}</ref>, making it the longest underground railway in the world, and one of the most served in terms of stations. There are also numerous [[closed London Underground stations|closed stations]]. In 2005&ndash;2006, 971 million passengers used the Underground and for the first time ever in 2006&ndash;2007, over one [[billion]] passengers were recorded. As of March 2007, just over 3 million passengers use the Underground each day, with an average of 3.4 million passengers on weekdays.<ref name="billionpassengers">{{ cite press release | title = Tube carries one billion passengers for first time | publisher = Transport for London | date =[[2007-03-28]] | url = http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4770.aspx | accessdate =2007-04-02 }}</ref>

Since 2003, the Underground has been part of [[Transport for London]] (TfL), which also administers numerous other transport-related functions, including the famous red [[double-decker bus]]es. The former London Underground Limited was a subsidiary of [[London Regional Transport]], a statutory corporation.

==History==
{{main|History of the London Underground}}
[[Image:Gb-lu-Angel-southbound.jpg|thumb|The nickname "the Tube" comes from the circular tube-like tunnels and platforms through which the trains travel. This photograph shows a southbound [[Northern line]] station platform at [[Angel tube station]].]]

The first section of the [[Metropolitan Railway]] and of the London Underground ran between Paddington (Bishop's Road), now [[Paddington station|Paddington]], and Farringdon Street, now [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]], and was the world's first urban underground passenger-carrying railway. It was built as dual gauge – able to accommodate both [[Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel|Brunel's]] '[[Broad Gauge|broad gauge]]' (7 ft ¼in / 2.14 m) trains as well as the 4 ft 8½in (1.435 m) gauge of the other trains serving London. Following delays for financial and other reasons after the railway was authorised in 1854, public traffic began on [[10 January]] [[1863]].<ref name="history"/> 41,000 passengers were carried that day, with trains running every ten minutes; by 1880 the expanded 'Met' was carrying 40 million passengers a year. Other lines swiftly followed, and by 1884 the Inner Circle (today's [[Circle line]]) was complete. 

The early tunnels were dug using [[cut-and-cover]] construction methods. This included the District line, which necessitated the demolition of a number of houses over the site of the line between [[Paddington]] and [[Bayswater]].

The first trains were steam-hauled, which required effective ventilation to the surface. Ventilation shafts at various points on the route allowed the engines to expel steam and bring fresh air into the tunnels. One such vent is at Leinster Gardens, W2.<ref>{{cite web

</ref>  In order to preserve the visual characteristics in what is still a well-to-do street, a five-foot-thick (1.5&nbsp;m) concrete façade was constructed to resemble a genuine house frontage.

Advances in electric traction allowed later tunnels to be deeper underground than the original cut-and-cover method allowed, and deep-level tunnel design improved, including the use of [[tunnelling shield]]s. The [[City & South London Railway]] (now part of the [[Northern line]]), the first "deep-level" line and electrically operated, opened in 1890.

===Into the 20th century===
In the early 20th century, the presence of six independent operators running different Underground lines caused passengers substantial inconvenience; in many places passengers had to walk some distance above ground to change between lines. The costs associated with running such a system were also heavy, and as a result many companies looked to financiers who could give them the money they needed to expand into the lucrative suburbs as well as electrify the earlier steam operated lines. The most prominent of these was [[Charles Yerkes]], an American [[tycoon]] who between 1900 and 1902 acquired the [[Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways#Metropolitan District Railway|Metropolitan District Railway]] and the as yet unbuilt [[Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway]] (later to become part of the [[Northern line]]). 

Yerkes also acquired the Great Northern & Strand Railway, the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway (jointly to become the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway]], the core of the [[Piccadilly line]]) and the Baker Street & Waterloo Railway (to become the [[Bakerloo line]]) to form [[Underground Electric Railways Company|Underground Electric Railways of London Company Ltd]] (UERL) on [[9 April]] [[1902]]. That company also owned three tramway companies and went on to buy the [[London General Omnibus Company]], creating an organisation colloquially known as the Combine. On [[1 January]] [[1913]] the UERL absorbed two other independent tube lines, the C&SLR and the Central London Railway, the latter having opened an important east-west cross-city line from Bank to Shepherd's Bush on [[30 July]] [[1900]]. The Central London Railway was nicknamed the "Twopenny Tube" for its flat fare and cylindrical tunnels; the "tube" nickname was eventually transferred to the Underground system as a whole.

===The 1930s and 1940s===
In 1933 the Combine and all the municipal and independent bus and tram undertakings were merged into the [[London's transport history from 1933|London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), a public corporation that approximated in scope to the present-day [[Transport for London|TfL]]. It set in motion a scheme for expansion of the network, the 1935–1940 [[New Works programme]], to extend some lines and to take over the operation of others from the main-line railway companies, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] froze all these schemes.

During the 1930s and 1940s, several sections of main-line railway were converted into (surface) lines of the Underground. The oldest part of today's Underground network is the [[Central line]] between [[Leyton]] and [[Loughton]], which opened as a railway seven years before the Underground itself.

From mid-1940, [[the Blitz]] led to the use of many underground stations as [[air-raid shelter|shelters]] during [[air raid]]s and overnight. The authorities initially tried to prevent this, but later supplied [[bunk]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[catering]] facilities. Later in the war, eight [[London deep-level shelters]] were constructed under stations, ostensibly to be used as shelters (each deep-level shelter could hold 8,000 people, though plans were in place to convert them for a new express line parallel to the Northern Line after the war. Some stations (now mostly disused) were converted into government offices: for example, [[Down Street tube station|Down Street]] was used for the headquarters of the Railway Executive Committee and was also used for meetings of the [[War Cabinet]] before the [[Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms|Cabinet War Rooms]] were completed;<ref name=Disused_1>

===Post-war developments===
[[Image:TubeStationWithTrain.jpg|thumb||A [[London Underground 1995 Stock]] train pulls into [[Mornington Crescent tube station|Mornington Crescent]] station on the [[Northern line]].]]
Following the war, travel congestion continued to rise. The LPTB and its successor the London Transport Executive undertook a programme of war repair and improvement works during the 1940s and 1950s though little money was provided for expansion or improvements to the system. The first real investment came with the carefully planned [[Victoria line]] on a diagonal northeast-southwest alignment beneath central London, which opened in stages between 1968 and 1971. The Piccadilly line was extended to [[Heathrow Airport]] in 1977, and the [[Jubilee line]] was opened in 1979, taking over part of the Bakerloo line, with new tunnels between Baker Street and Charing Cross. In 1999 the Jubilee was extended to Stratford in London's East End, including the completely refurbished interchange station at Westminster, in several stages. The Jubilee's old terminal platforms at Charing Cross were abandoned but maintained operable for emergencies. 

Since [[January 2003]] the Underground has been operated as a [[Public-Private Partnership|Public&ndash;Private Partnership]] (PPP), where the infrastructure and rolling stock are maintained by two private companies ([[Metronet]] and [[Tube Lines]]) under 30-year contracts, but it remains publicly owned and operated, by [[Transport for London|TfL]].

There was much controversy over the implementation of the PPP. Supporters of the change claimed that the private sector would eliminate the inefficiencies of public sector enterprises, while opponents said that the need to make profits would reduce the investment and public service aspects of the Underground. There has since been criticism of the performance of the private companies; for example the [[January 2007]] edition of [[The Londoner]],<ref>

==Infrastructure==
[[Image:London Underground Zone 1.svg|center|600px|thumb|Zone 1 (central zone) of the Underground (and [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]]) network in a more geographically accurate layout than the usual Tube map, using the same style]]

The Underground does not run 24 hours a day, (except for at New Year and on major public events - such as the Queens Golden Jubilee in 2002) because the majority of lines have only two tracks (one in each direction) and therefore need to close at night for planned maintenance work. First trains on the network start operating around 04:30, running until around 01:30. Unlike systems such as the [[New York City Subway]], few parts of the Underground have express tracks that would allow trains to be routed around maintenance sites. Recently, greater use has been made of weekend closures of parts of the system for scheduled engineering work.

===Rolling stock===
{{See|London Underground rolling stock}}
[[Image:Stratford Depot 27.JPG|thumb|[[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996 Stock]] trains at Stratford Market Depot]]
The Underground uses rolling stock built between 1960 and 2005. Stock on subsurface lines is identified by a letter (such as [[London Underground A62 Stock|A Stock]], used on the [[Metropolitan line]]), while tube stock is identified by the year in which it was designed (for example, [[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996 Stock]], used on the [[Jubilee line]]). All lines are worked by a single type of stock except the [[District line]], which uses both [[London Underground C69 Stock|C]] and [[London Underground D78 Stock|D]] Stock. Two types of stock are currently being developed &mdash; [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 Stock]] for the Victoria line and [[London Underground S Stock|S stock]] for the subsurface lines, with the Metropolitan line A Stock being replaced first. Rollout of both is expected to begin about 2009.

In addition to the Electric-Multiple units described above, there are [[London Underground engineering stock|Engineering Stock]], such as balast trains and brake vans. They are identified by a 1-3 letter prefix, then a number. 
{{See|London Underground engineering stock}}

===Stations===
{{See also|List of London Underground stations|Closed London Underground stations}}
The Underground serves 275 [[Underground station|stations]], including [[Shoreditch tube station|Shoreditch]] (closed, but served by a replacement bus service, until [[Shoreditch High Street station]] opens as part of the East London line Extension). Fourteen Underground stations are outside Greater London, of which five ([[Amersham station|Amersham]], [[Chalfont & Latimer station|Chalfont & Latimer]], [[Chesham tube station|Chesham]], [[Chorleywood station|Chorleywood]], [[Epping tube station|Epping]]) are beyond the [[M25 motorway|M25 London Orbital motorway]].

===Lines===
<!--
''Note: Although it is not [[Capitalization|grammatically]] correct, TfL nowadays seem to use mixed upper/lower case when referring to the line names on all literature, maps, signs and even labels on some trains. For example, the [[Circle line]] is always listed as Circle '''line''', not Circle '''Line'''. However this does not extend to [[National Rail]] services, eg. the [[North London Line]].''

====Subsurface versus deep-level tube lines====<!-- This section is linked from [[King's Cross fire]] -->
[[Image:London Underground subsurface and tube trains.jpg|thumb|Underground trains come in two sizes, larger subsurface trains and smaller tube trains. A [[Metropolitan line]] [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|A Stock]] train (left) passes a [[Piccadilly line]] [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] train (right) in the siding at [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane]]]]

Lines on the Underground can be classified into two types: subsurface and deep-level.
* The subsurface lines were dug by the [[cut-and-cover]] method, with the tracks running about 5&nbsp;[[metre|m]] below the surface. Trains on the subsurface lines slightly exceed the standard British [[loading gauge]].
*The deep-level or tube lines, bored using a [[tunnelling shield]], run about 20&nbsp;m below the surface (although this varies considerably), with each track in a separate tunnel lined with cast-iron or precast concrete rings. These tunnels can have a diameter as small as 3.56&nbsp;m (11&nbsp;ft 8.25&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) and the loading gauge is thus considerably smaller than on the subsurface lines.
Lines of both types usually emerge onto the surface outside the central area, except the [[Victoria line]], which is in tunnel except for its depot, and the very short [[Waterloo & City line]], which runs entirely in the central area and has no surface section. Only 45% of the Underground is in tunnel.

While the tube lines are for the most part self-contained, the subsurface lines are part of an interconnected network: Each shares track with at least two other lines. The subsurface arrangement is somewhat similar to the [[New York City Subway]], which also runs separate "lines" over shared tracks.

====Non-served areas====
Six of the 32 [[London borough]]s are not served by the Underground. Five of these are south of the [[River Thames]]: [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] and [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]]. This lack of lines and stations is sometimes attributed to the [[geology]] of that area, the region being almost one large [[aquifer]]. Another reason is that during the great period of tube-building in the early 20th century south London was already well served by the efficiently-run suburban lines of the [[London and South Western Railway]], [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] and the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]], then being [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]], which obviated the need for Underground expansion into those areas. Suburban traffic was essential to the viability of the southern railways, while railways to the north and west were able to focus on long-distance traffic, which was profitable and was not subject to the short-term traffic peaks of suburban traffic. In contrast, suburban traffic obstructed their long-distance operations and required substantial infrastructure investment, without providing compensating returns.

The sixth unserved borough is [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], with the exception of [[Manor House tube station|Manor House]] and [[Old Street tube station|Old Street]] stations just outside its boundary. Plans for the borough to be better served have been drawn up in the form of the [[London Overground]]. This is a new metro-style railway which is to take over the [[East London line]] (when its [[East London line#Extension|extension]] opens, scheduled for 2010) and the [[North London Line]] to form an almost orbital railway round London.

====International connections====
The Underground serves [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] for national and international flights; and [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]] (via [[King's Cross St. Pancras tube station|King's Cross St. Pancras]]) for [[Eurostar]] services to mainland Europe, via the [[Channel Tunnel]].

===Electrification===
{{seealso|Railway electrification in Great Britain}}
[[Image:Canary.wharf.jubilee.line.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Canary Wharf tube station]] ([[Jubilee line]])]]
The Underground is one of the few networks in the world that uses a four-rail system. The additional rail carries the electrical return that on third-rail and overhead networks is provided by the running rails. On the Underground a top-contact third rail is beside the track, energised at +420 V DC, and a top-contact fourth rail is centrally between the running rails, at -210 V DC, which combine to provide a traction voltage of 630 V DC.

Most tube lines run in cast-iron tunnels (only some of the more recent constructions use concrete tunnel lining). Using a third-rail scheme necessitates that the return current is conducted through one (earthed) running rail. Such current is just as easily able to travel through the cast-iron tunnel lining, and unless the joints between the sections are electrically sound, the current will arc across the sections causing considerable damage, or [[corrosion|corrode]] the tunnel segments via [[electrolysis]]. There are also many cast-iron gas and water mains in the vicinity of the tube tunnels, and the return current would travel along these just as easily. Some of these mains date back to the 19th century and the joints between separate sections would certainly not have been designed to be electrically sound, as deep-level electric tube trains were some way off. 

Another advantage of the fourth rail system is that the two running rails are available exclusively for [[track circuit]]s, of which there are many. 

The surface sections of the lines are constructed using fourth-rail purely to permit through running with the tube lines, there being no other technical reason to do so.  

The traction current has no direct earth point, but there are two resistors connected across the traction supply. The centre tap of the resistors is earthed, establishing the reference point between the positive and negative rails by [[voltage division]]. The resistors are large enough to prevent large currents flowing through the earthed infrastructure. The positive resistor is twice as large as the negative resistor, since the positive rail carries twice the voltage of the negative rail.

Some above-ground sections are shared with [[National Rail]] trains which use the three-rail system. On these sections the fourth rail is bonded to the running rails, to keep it at earth potential, and the third rail is held at +630 volt DC.

==Ticketing==
{{main|London Underground ticketing}}
[[Image:London-underground-travelcard.jpg|thumb|London Underground One-Day Travelcard]]
[[Image:Oyster card front small.png|thumb|London Underground Oyster Card]]
The Underground uses TfL's [[Travelcard]] zones to calculate fares. [[Travelcard Zone 1]] is the most central, with a boundary just beyond the Circle line, and [[Travelcard Zone 6|Zone 6]] is the outermost and includes [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Stations on the Metropolitan line outside Greater London are in special Zones A to D, but will be reclassified into zones 7-9 from January 2008.<ref>

  | url =http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1855280.mostviewed.numbered_zones_for_stations.php
  | accessdate =2007-11-24  }}</ref>

There are staffed ticket offices, some open for limited periods only, and ticket machines usable at any time. Some machines that sell a limited range of tickets accept coins only, other touch-screen machines accept coins and English (but not [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] or [[Scotland|Scottish]]) [[British banknotes|bank notes]], and usually give change. These machines also accept major credit and debit cards: some newer machines accept cards only. In 2005 the Underground started to accept American Express.

More recently, TfL has introduced the [[Oyster card]], a [[smartcard]] with an embedded contactless [[RFID]] chip, that travellers can obtain, charge with credit, and use to pay for travel. Like Travelcards they can be used on the Underground, buses, trams and the Docklands Light Railway. The Oyster card is cheaper to operate than cash ticketing or the older-style magnetic-strip-based Travelcards{{Specify|date=December 2006}}, and the Underground is encouraging passengers to use Oyster cards instead of Travelcards and cash (on buses) by implementing significant price differences. Oyster-based Travelcards can be used on National Rail throughout London. Pay as you go is available on a restricted, but increasing, [[Oyster card (pay as you go) on National Rail|number of routes]].<ref>

===Penalty fares and fare evasion===
[[Image:London Bridge Jubilee Platforms.JPG|right|thumb|Jubilee line platforms (London Bridge station)]]
In addition to automatic and staffed ticket gates, the Underground is patrolled by both uniformed and plain-clothes ticket inspectors with hand-held [[Oyster card]] readers. Passengers travelling without a ticket valid for their entire journey are required to at least pay a £20 [[penalty fare]] and can be prosecuted for fare evasion under the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1889]] are subject to a fine of up to £1,000, or three months' imprisonment. [[Oyster card|Oyster]] pre-pay users who have failed to 'touch in' at the start of their journey are charged the 'maximum cash fare' (£4, or £5 at some [[National Rail]] stations) upon 'touching out'. In addition, an Oyster card user who has failed to touch in at the start of their journey and who is detected mid-journey (''i.e.'' on a train) by an Inspector is now liable to a penalty fare of £20. No £4 maximum charge will be applied at their destination as the inspector will apply an 'exit token' to their card.

It should be noted that whilst the Conditions of Carriage require period Travelcard holders to touch-in and touch-out at the start and end of their journey, any Oystercard user who has a valid period Travelcard covering their entire journey is not liable to pay a Penalty fare where they have not touched-in. Neither the Conditions of Carriage or Schedule 17 of the [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]], which shows how and when Penalty fares can be issued, would allow the issuing of a Penalty fare to a traveller who had already paid the correct fare for their journey.

==Delays==
According to statistics obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act]], the average commuter on the Metropolitan line wasted three days, 10 hours and 25 minutes in 2006 due to delays (not including missed connections).<ref>

==Station access==

[[Accessibility]] by people with mobility issues was not considered when most of the system was built, and most older stations are inaccessible to disabled people. More recent stations were designed for accessibility, but [[retrofit]]ting accessibility features to old stations is at best prohibitively expensive and technically extremely difficult, and often impossible. Even when there are already [[escalators]] or [[Elevator|lift]]s, there are often steps between the lift or escalator landings and the platforms.

Most stations on the surface have at least a short flight of stairs to gain access from street level, and the great majority of below-ground stations require use of stairs or some of the system's 410 [[escalator]]s (each going at a speed of {{convert|145|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} per minute, approximately 1.65&nbsp;[[miles per hour]]). There are also some lengthy walks and further flights of steps required to gain access to platforms. The station at Covent Garden has the equivalent of 15 storeys of steps to reach the [[exit]], so an [[announcement]] is made for passengers to queue for a lift, as walking the steps can be dangerous.

The escalators in Underground stations include some of the longest in Europe, and all are custom-built. The longest escalator is at [[Angel tube station|Angel station]], 60 m (197 ft) long, with a vertical rise of 27.5 m (90 ft).<ref name="facts"/> They run 20 hours a day, 364 days a year, with 95% of them operational at any one time, and can cope with 13,000 people per hour. Convention and signage stipulate that people using escalators on the Underground ''stand'' on the right-hand side so as not to obstruct those who ''walk'' past them on the left.

TfL produces a map indicating which stations are accessible, and since 2004 line maps indicate with a [[wheelchair]] symbol those stations that provide step-free access from street level. Step height from platform to train is up to 300&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]], and there can be a large [[Mind the gap|gap]] between the train and curved platforms. Only the [[Jubilee line Extension]] is completely accessible.

TfL plans that by 2020 there should be a network of over 100 fully accessible stations, consists of those recently built or rebuilt, and a handful of suburban stations that happen to have level access, along with selected 'key stations', which will be rebuilt. These key stations have been chosen due to high usage, [[interchange station|interchange]] potential, and geographic spread, so that up to 75% of journeys will be achievable step-free.<ref>

==Safety==
[[Image:Westminster underground.JPG|thumb|[[Westminster tube station|Westminster station]] &mdash; extensive structures are required to support [[Portcullis House]] above.]]

=== Suicides ===
Most fatalities on the network are [[suicide]]s. Most platforms at deep tube stations have pits beneath the track, originally constructed to aid [[drainage]] of water from the platforms, but they also help prevent death or serious injury when a passenger falls or jumps in front of a train and aid access to the unfortunate person.<ref>{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2007-01-10 
}}</ref> These pits are officially called "anti-suicide pits", colloquially "suicide pits" or "dead man's trenches". Delays resulting from a person jumping or falling in front of a train as it pulls into a station are announced as an "unfortunate delay", "passenger action", "customer incident" or "a person under a train", and are referred to by staff as a "one under". London Underground has a specialist "Therapy Unit" to deal with drivers' post-traumatic stress, resulting from someone jumping under their train.

The Jubilee line extension is the first line to have [[Platform screen doors|platform edge doors]]. These prevent people from falling or jumping onto the tracks, but the main financial justification for their provision was to control station ventilation by restricting the 'piston-effect' of the moving air caused by the trains.

===Accidents===
{{main| London Underground accidents}}

The Underground network carries around a [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] passengers a year. It is a very safe mass transport system, with just one fatal accident for every 300 million journeys.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/research/backgrounders/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2155915 Safety first.] ''[[The Economist]]'' ([[23 October]], [[2003]]) Retrieved [[3 December]], [[2006]].</ref>

There are several [[safety]] warnings given to passengers, such as the [[traditional]] '[[mind the gap]]' announcement and the regular announcements for passengers to keep behind the yellow line.

===Terrorism===
{{main|London Underground terrorism}}
The Underground is an important part of everyday life for millions of people. This makes it a prime target for terrorists. Many warnings and several attacks, some successful, have been made on the Underground, [[21 July 2005 London bombings|the most recent]] on the [[21 July]] [[2005]], although in that case only the detonators exploded. The most recent [[7 July 2005 London bombings|attack]] causing damage was on [[7 July]] [[2005]], when three suicide bombers blew themselves up on three trains. The earliest attack on the London Underground was in 1885, when a bomb exploded on a Metropolitan line train at Euston Square station. The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] (and its predecessors) carried out over ten separate attacks between 1939 and 1993.

===Overcrowding===
Relatively few accidents are caused by overcrowding on the platforms, and staff monitor platforms and passageways at busy times and prevent people entering the system if they become overcrowded. [[Camden Town tube station|Camden Town station]] is exit-only on Sunday afternoons (13:00&ndash;17:30) for this reason, and [[Covent Garden tube station|Covent Garden]] has access restrictions at times. Restrictions are introduced at other stations when necessary. Several stations have been rebuilt to deal with overcrowding issues, with Clapham Common and Clapham North on the Northern Line being the last remaining stations with a single narrow platform with tracks on both sides.

At particularly busy occasions, such as [[Soccer|football]] matches, [[British Transport Police]] may be present to help with overcrowding.
On [[24 September]] [[2007]], King's Cross underground station was totally closed due to "overcrowding".
According to a 2003 House of Commons report,<ref>{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-01-18 }}</ref> commuters face a "daily trauma" and are forced to travel in "intolerable conditions".

===Smoking===
[[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]] was allowed in certain carriages in trains until [[July 1984]]. In the middle of 1987 smoking was banned for a six-month trial period in all parts of the Underground, and the ban was made permanent after the major [[King's Cross fire]] in [[November 1987]].<ref>{{cite web

  | format =rtf
  | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}, p19</ref>

===Air Pollution===

{{main|London Underground air pollution}}

According to the Discovery Channel documentary, Underground Cities: London, inhaling fumes while traveling on London's Tube for 40 minutes is "the equivalent to smoking two cigarettes", however, the accuracy this information is disputed (see the [[London Underground air pollution|main article]] for more information).

This statement compares the weight of particulate matter that is breathed and not the health effects. Cigarette smoke consists of products of combustion containing oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur; various alkaloids, aromatic hydrocarbons and tar. Dust in the Underground tunnels is mainly iron (from the wheel–rail interface), skin cells, hair cells and clothing fibres (from passengers), and quartz silica (from brakes). Weight for weight, tunnel dust has far less impact on human health than cigarette smoke.

=== Photography ===

Photography for personal use is permitted in public areas of the Underground,<ref>London Underground.  [http://tube-tfl.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/tube_tfl.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=GfElV__h&p_lva=&p_faqid=432 Fiming & Photography - can I film/take photos on the Tube?] Retrieved [[3 December]], [[2006]].</ref> but the use of [[Tripod (photography)|tripods]] and other supports is forbidden as it poses a danger in the often cramped spaces and crowds found underground.  [[Flash (photography)|Flash photography]] is also forbidden as it may distract drivers and disrupt fire-detection equipment. For the same reason bright auto-focus assist lights should be switched off or covered when photographing in the Underground.

===Safety culture===
The Underground's staff safety regimen has drawn criticism. In [[January 2002]] it was fined £225,000 for breaching [[Health and Safety Executive|safety standards for workers]]. In court, the judge reprimanded the company for ''"sacrificing safety"'' to keep trains running ''"at all costs."'' Workers had been instructed to work in the dark with the power rails live, even during rainstorms. Several workers had received electric shocks as a result.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/england/1752928.stm Fine over workers' Tube danger.] ''[[BBC News]]'' ([[10 January]], [[2002]]). Retrieved [[3 December]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Age===
Due to a combination of the age of the system and significant under-funding in the past, some parts of the Underground's infrastructure are substantially older than their equivalents in other cities. Recently the private infrastructure company [[Tube Lines]] was reported to be using online auction website [[eBay]] to find spare parts for some of its equipment which was so old that parts were otherwise unobtainable.<ref>

==Future projects==
=== Extensions and new stations ===

[[Image:Piccadilly T5 Extension.JPG|thumb|A diagram at [[Ealing Common tube station|Ealing Common]], showing the layout of the [[Piccadilly line]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]] once the T5 Extension opens.]]
* A new station is being built on the [[Piccadilly line]] at [[Heathrow Airport]] [[Heathrow Terminal 5 station|Terminal 5]]. The extension consists of a two-platform station, two sidings where trains can be stabled, approximately 3&nbsp;km of 4.5&nbsp;m diameter bored tunnels, a ventilation shaft and two escape shafts. The works have been substantially completed, and final testing and commissioning will be carried out during 2007. When the junction between the extension and the Heathrow Loop was built, the tunnel between [[Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station|Terminal 4]] and [[Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 tube station|Terminals 1,2,3]] was out of service but it re-opened on [[17 September]] [[2006]]. The extension is due to open in 2008.<ref>London Underground.  [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/metro/article.asp?id=1206 Piccadilly line update.] ([[21 August]] [[2006]]). Retrieved [[3 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

* A new station at [[Wood Lane (Hammersmith & City Line) tube station|Wood Lane]] is due to open in 2008 to serve the new [[Westfield London]] shopping centre.

* The [[Bakerloo line]] may be re-extended to [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]] from its current terminus at [[Harrow & Wealdstone station|Harrow & Wealdstone]]. This is part of the Transport 2025 strategy, but no more precise timescale has been announced.<ref>{{cite web

* TfL and [[Hertfordshire County Council]] would like to connect the [[Watford tube station|Watford branch]] of the [[Metropolitan line]] to the disused [[Croxley Green railway station|Croxley Green]] Network Rail branch, between [[Croxley Green]] and [[Watford West railway station|Watford West]]. A new station would be built at [[Ascot Road tube station|Ascot Road]] as a replacement for Croxley Green, Watford West would be heavily refurbished and Watford (Metropolitan) would close. This extension would bring the Underground back to central Watford and the important [[Watford Junction station|Watford Junction]] main-line station. The current timetable suggests a 2011 opening date, but the extension currently lacks funding and planning permission.<ref>{{cite web

When it reopens in [[2010]] (with the connection to Highbury & Islington due in 2011), it will be part of the new [[London Overground]] network, not of the Underground; however, it will still be run by TfL.

=== Line upgrades ===

Each line is being upgraded to improve capacity and reliability, with new computerised signalling, [[automatic train operation]] (ATO), track replacement and station refurbishment, and, where needed, new rolling stock.

* During 2007, work began to install [[Railway signalling#Moving block|moving block signalling]] and [[Automatic train operation|ATO]] on the [[Jubilee line]], for completion in 2009. When this work is complete, a similar upgrade will be performed on the [[Northern line]], for completion in 2012. Both lines already have modern rolling stock. 
* The [[Victoria line]] will receive new [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 Stock]] trains from 2009 onwards. They will be higher in capacity and offer improved acceleration. A new [[Automatic train operation|ATO]] system will be brought into service once the old fleet has been withdrawn. When all upgrades are complete in 2013, train frequency will have improved from 28 trains per hour to 33.
* The [[Metropolitan line]], [[Hammersmith & City line]], [[Circle line]] and [[District line]] will receive new [[London Underground S Stock|S Stock]] trains, to be introduced in phases from 2009 to 2015.<ref>{{cite press release

The last trains to be replaced, 75 District line trains, are currently receiving interim refurbishment. Lines that are currently served by six-car trains will get seven-car trains, once necessary platform-lengthening works are completed. 
* The [[Piccadilly line]] and [[Bakerloo line]] will receive new rolling stock and other upgrades by 2014 and 2020 respectively.

Upgrade programmes on the [[Waterloo & City line]] (without [[Automatic train operation|ATO]]) and [[Central Line|Central line]] are largely complete.

=== Other projects ===
* [[Shepherd's Bush tube station (Central Line)|Shepherd's Bush station]] on the Central line will be completely rebuilt above ground and below.
* [[London Victoria station|Victoria]] and [[Kings Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross St Pancras]] stations will have new passageways and an extra ticket hall each to improve capacity.
* In summer, temperatures on parts of the Underground can become very uncomfortable due to its deep, narrow and poorly ventilated tube tunnels: temperatures of 47 °C  (117 °F)  were reported in the [[2006 European heat wave]].<ref>Griffiths, Emma. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5191604.stm Baking hot at Baker Street.] ''[[BBC News]]'' ([[18 July]] [[2006]]).

After this, coverage will be extended to the tunnel between the two stations. The trial will look at the viability of extending coverage across the rest of the Underground network.
* Although not part of London Underground, the [[Crossrail]] scheme will provide a new route across central London integrated with the tube network.

==Image==

TfL's [[Tube map]] and "[[roundel]]" [[logo]] are instantly recognisable by any Londoner, almost any Briton, and many people around the world. The original maps were often street maps with the lines superimposed, and the stylised Tube map evolved from a design by electrical engineer [[Harry Beck]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite web

  | publisher =[[TfL]]
  | url =http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/images/company/history/beckmap1.jpg
  | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref>  Virtually every major urban rail system in the world now has a map in a similar stylised layout and many bus companies have also adopted the concept. TfL licences the sale of clothing and other accessories featuring its graphic elements and it takes legal action against unauthorised use of its trademarks and of the Tube map. Nevertheless, unauthorised copies of the logo continue to crop up worldwide. The phrase "[[mind the gap]]," played when trains stop at certain platforms, has also become a well known catchphrase.

===The roundel===
[[Image:LU Leytonstone sign.jpg|thumb|The use of the roundel with the station name in the blue bar dates from 1908. The roundel seen above can be found at [[Leytonstone tube station]].]]
The origins of the [[roundel]], in earlier years known as the 'bulls-eye' or 'target', are obscure. While the first use of a roundel in a London transport context was the 19th-century symbol of the [[London General Omnibus Company]] — a wheel with a bar across the centre bearing the word '''GENERAL''' —  its usage on the Underground stems from the decision in 1908 to find a more obvious way of highlighting station names on platforms. The red circle with blue name bar was quickly adopted, with the word "U<small>NDERGROUN</small>D" across the bar, as an early corporate identity.<ref>{{cite web
  | title =Logo
  | publisher =[[London Transport Museum]]
  | date =
  | url =http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/exhibitions/online_exhibitions/logo/index.html
  | accessdate = }} Not accessible [[2007-01-10]]</ref>  The logo was modified by [[Edward Johnston]] in 1919.

Each station displays the Underground roundel, often containing the station's name in the central bar, at entrances and repeatedly along the platform, so that the name can easily be seen by passengers on arriving trains. 

The roundel has been used for buses and the tube for many years, and since [[Transport for London|TfL]] took control it has been applied to other transport types (taxi, [[Tramlink|tram]], [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]], etc.) in different colour pairs. The roundel has to some extent become a symbol for London itself.

===Typography===
Edward Johnston designed TfL's distinctive [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]], in 1916. "[[Johnston (typeface)|New Johnston]]", modified to include lower case, is still in use. It is noted for the curl at the bottom of the [[minuscule]] ''l'', which other sans-serif typefaces have discarded, and for the diamond-shaped [[tittle]] on the minuscule ''i'' and ''j'', whose shape also appears in the [[full stop]], and is the origin of other punctuation marks in the face. TfL owns the copyright to and exercises control over the New Johnston typeface, but a close approximation of the face exists in the [[TrueType]] computer font ''Paddington''.

===Contribution to arts===
[[Image:RussellSqTilework.jpg|thumb|An Edwardian tile pattern at [[Russell Square tube station]]]]
The Underground sponsors and contributes to the arts via its [[Platform for Art]] and [[Poems on the Underground]] projects. Poster and billboard space (and in the case of [[Gloucester Road tube station]], an entire disused platform) is given over to artwork and poetry to "create an environment for positive impact and to enhance and enrich the journeys of…passengers".<ref>{{cite web

[[Oval tube station]] has cricket-themed decorations, with murals, statues and banners all celebrating the game. Unique Edwardian tile patterns, designed by [[Leslie Green]] and installed in the 1900s, were also used on the platforms of many of the [[Charles Yerkes|Yerkes]]-designed stations on the Bakerloo, Northern and Piccadilly lines. Many of these tile patterns survive, though a significant number of these are now replicas.<ref name="edwardiantilepatterns">{{ cite web | title = London Underground's Edwardian Tile Patterns | publisher = Doug Rose | url=http://www.dougrose.co.uk/ | accessdate = 2007-07-12 }}</ref>

===In popular culture===
{{main|London Underground in popular culture}}
The Underground has been featured in many movies and television shows, including ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' and ''[[Tube Tales]]''; the London Underground Film Office handles over 100 requests per month. The Underground has also featured in music such as [[The Jam]]'s "[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]" and in literature such as the graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta]]''. Popular legends about the Underground being haunted persist to this day.<ref>{{ cite web | title = London Underground Ghosts | publisher = BBC h2g2 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A673391 | accessdate = 2007-10-14 }}</ref>
