'''Memphis''' is a [[city]] in the southwest corner of [[Tennessee]], and the [[county seat]] of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]]. Memphis rises above the [[Mississippi River]] on the 4th [[Chickasaw Bluff]] just below the mouth of the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River]]. As of 2006, Memphis had an estimated population of 670,902, making it the largest city in the state of [[Tennessee]], the second largest in the southeastern region (only to [[Jacksonville, Florida]]), and the [[List of United States cities by population|17th largest]] in the [[United States]] <ref name="06EST"/>. The greater [[Memphis metropolitan area]] area, including the adjacent areas of [[Mississippi]] and [[Arkansas]], has a population of 1,260,581. This makes Memphis the second largest metropolitan area in [[Tennessee]], surpassed only by metropolitan [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. Memphis is the youngest of Tennessee's four major cities (traditionally including [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and Nashville). A resident of Memphis is referred to as a '''Memphian''' and the Memphis region is known as the [[Mid-South]].

== History ==
[[Image:Riverboats at Memphis.jpg|right|thumbnail|Mississippi River landing, Memphis, 1906]]The Memphis area was first settled by the [[Mississippian Culture]] and then by the [[Chickasaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribe]].
European exploration came years later, with [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] believed to have visited what is now the Memphis area as early as the [[1540s]]. By the [[1680s]], French explorers led by [[René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] built [[Fort Prudhomme]] in the vicinity, the first European settlement in what would become Memphis, predating [[English people|English]] settlements in [[East Tennessee]] by more than 70 years. <ref>[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=F047 Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture - Fort Prudhomme and La Salle]</ref>

Despite such early outposts, the land comprising present-day Memphis remained in a largely unorganized territory throughout most of the [[18th century]], while the boundaries of what would become Tennessee continued to evolve from its parent — the [[Carolina Colony]], later [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]]. By 1796, the community was the westernmost point of the newly admitted state of Tennessee.[[Image:Union Avenue.jpg|left|thumbnail|Cotton merchants on Union Avenue, Memphis in 1937]]

Memphis was founded in [[1820]] by John Overton, James Winchester, and [[Andrew Jackson]] and was incorporated as a city in [[1826]].  The city was named after the [[Memphis, Egypt|ancient capital]] of [[Egypt]] on the [[Nile River]].  

The cotton economy of the antebellum South depended on the forced labor of large numbers of [[History of slavery in the United States|African-American slaves]], and Memphis became a major slave market. [[Slavery|Slaves]] seeking their freedom turned to the [[Underground Railroad]] to escape to the free states of the North, and the Memphis [[Burkle Estate|home of Jacob Burkle]] was a way-station on their route to freedom.  

At the time of the [[American Civil War]], Memphis was already an important regional city because of its river trade and railroad connections, particularly the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]], completed in [[1857]].  [[Tennessee#History|Tennessee]] seceded from the Union in June 1861 and Memphis briefly became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold.  [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces captured Memphis from Confederacy in the [[Battle of Memphis]] on [[June 6]], [[1862]], and the city remained under [[Union army|Union]] control for the duration of the war, except for a dramatic [[Second Battle of Memphis|raid]] conducted by [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. Memphis became a Union supply base and continued to prosper throughout the war.

Extensive [[yellow fever]] epidemics in the 1870s (1873, 1878, 1879) devastated the city.  At that time it was not understood that this fatal [[infectious disease|disease]] was carried by a mosquito vector, so public health measures were unsuccessful.  So many died or fled the [[epidemics]] that in 1879 Memphis lost its city charter and until 1893 Memphis was governed as merely a taxing district.<ref>[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=M069 Memphis]</ref>  Eventually improvements in sanitation removed the breeding grounds of the mosquito vector and the city  began to grow again. In [[1897]], Memphis' [[pyramid]]-shaped pavilion was a conspicuous part of the [[Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition (1897)|Tennessee Centennial]] exposition.

Memphis grew into the world's largest spot cotton market (over 40% of the nation's crop was traded here) and the world's largest hardwood lumber market. Into the 1950s, it was the world's largest mule market.<ref>[http://www.cityofmemphis.org/framework.aspx?page=296 City of Memphis Website - History of Memphis]</ref>  From the [[1910s]] to the [[1950s]], Memphis was a hotbed of [[machine politics]] under the direction of [[E. H. Crump|E. H. "Boss" Crump]].  During the Crump era, Memphis developed an extensive network of parks and public works as part of the national [[City Beautiful Movement]].  During the [[1960s]] the city was at the center of civil rights issues, notably the location of a sanitation workers' strike. Memphis is also where [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was assassinated on April 4, 1968 at the [[Lorraine Motel]], the day after giving his prophetic "I've Been to the Mountaintop" speech at the [[Mason Temple]].

[[Image:Jazz drummer.jpg|right|thumbnail|Jazz musician, Memphis, 1939]]Memphis is well known for its cultural contributions to the identity of the [[Southern United States|American south]]. Beginning in the early 20th Century Memphis became famous for the innovative strains of [[African-American]] music, including [[gospel music|gospel]], [[blues music|blues]], [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Rhythm and Blues]] genres, a tradition that continues to this day.  Many notable blues musicians grew up in and around the Memphis and northern Mississippi, and performed there regularly. These included such musical greats as [[Muddy Waters]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[B.B. King]], and [[Howlin' Wolf]]. The first [[African American]]-formatted radio station, [[WDIA]], was founded in the city in [[1947]] by [[Bert Ferguson]] and [[John Pepper]], and included a young B. B. King as disc jockey. B. B. King's moniker was derived from his WDIA nickname 'Beale Street Blues Boy', a reference to Memphis' [[Beale Street]] on which many nightclubs and blues venues were located.  The young [[Elvis Presley]] frequently listened to gospel and soul music, and many of his early recordings were inspired or written by African-American composers and recording artists in the [[Mid-South]] area.<ref>Peter Guralnick. New York Times, August 11, 2007</ref>

In addition to a rich musical heritage, Memphis also boasts a long culinary legacy dominated by regional [[barbecue]]. [[Regional variations of barbecue#Memphis|Memphis barbecue]] is rendered distinct by its sole usage of pork (as opposed to beef), focus on rib and shoulder cuts of meat, and multiple locally-owned barbecue restaurants. Celebration of this local dish reaches its climax each year in May, when the [[Memphis in May]] Festival holds its annual [http://memphisinmay.org/wbcc.htm World-Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest].

== Geography and climate ==
[[Image:Memphis front view.jpg|right|thumb|The Mud Island [[monorail]] on Front St in downtown Memphis]]
Memphis is located at {{coor dms|35|7|3|N|89|58|16|W|city}}.{{GR|1}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 313.8&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (763.4&nbsp;[[km²]]), of which, 302.3&nbsp;square miles (723.4&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 15.4&nbsp;square miles (40.0&nbsp;km²) of it (5.24%) is water.

=== Climate ===
Memphis has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with four distinct seasons. The summer months (late May to late September) are persistently hot (between 68 °F [20 °C] and 95 °F [35 °C]) and humid due to moisture encroaching from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Afternoon thunderstorms are frequent during some summers, but usually brief, lasting no longer than an hour. Early Autumn is pleasantly drier and mild, but can remain hot until late October. Abrupt but short-lived cold snaps are common. Late Autumn is rainy and colder, December being the third rainiest month of the year. Fall foliage becomes especially vibrant after the first frost, typically November, and lasts until early December. Winters are mild, but cold snaps can occur. The official all-time record low temperature was -13.0 °F (-25.0 °C), which occurred on [[December 24]], [[1963]]. Mild spells are sometimes warm with temperatures as high as 75 °F (23 °C) during January and February. Snowfall is not abundant but does occur during most winters, with an annual average of 5.7 inches (14.4 cm) at the airport. Spring often begins in late February or early March, following the onset of a sharp warmup. This season is also known as "severe weather season" due to the higher frequency of tornadoes, hail, and thunderstorms producing winds greater than 58 mph (93 km/h). Average rainfall is slightly higher during the spring months (except November) than the rest of the year, but not
to any noticeable extent. Historically, April is the month with the highest frequency of tornadoes, though tornadoes have occurred every month of the year. Memphis is sunny approximately 64% of the time.

=== Cityscape ===
[[Image:Tom Lee Park.JPG|thumb|right|View of the three bridges spanning over the Mississippi, as viewed from the [[Tom Lee Park]], west of downtown Memphis.]]
The city of Memphis is located in southwestern [[Tennessee]] and sits on the eastern bank of the [[Mississippi River]]. It is the regional hub for a [[tri-state area]] of [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]] and Tennessee. [[Interstate 40]] enters the city from the [[Ordinal direction|northeast]], and loops above the central part of the city, exiting across the Mississippi River and travelling to the [[west]]. [[Interstate 55]] approaches the city from the [[south]] and connects with [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], which completes the loop around central Memphis with I-40, and also leaves to the west. [[U.S. Highway 72]] leaves the city traveling to the [[Ordinal directions|southeast]].  The west end of [http://www.geocities.com/usend7079/End078/end078.htm U.S. Highway 78] begins in Memphis, TN on Linden Avenue at the intersection of 2nd Street.  As it leaves Memphis, US 78 follows Lamar Avenue, historically known as ''Pidgeon Roost Road'' for the nestings of [[passenger pigeon]]s formerly in the vicinity.  The east end of U.S. Highway 78 terminates in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

=== Aquifer ===
Shelby County is located over four natural [[aquifer]]s, one of which is recognized as the "Memphis sand aquifer" or simply as the "Memphis aquifer." This particular water source, located some 350 to 1100 feet underground, is stated to contain more than 100 trillion US gallons (380 km³) of water by Memphis Light, Gas, and Water<ref>[http://mlgw.com/SubView.php?key=about_ourutilservices Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Website - About Our Services]</ref>, which draws, verifies the cleanliness of, and distributes the water to over 250,000 customers. Furthermore, in the time since the tapping of the well in 1887, the aquifer has only descended 125 feet, suggesting a reliable water source in Memphis for years to come.<ref>

Memphis water is notably [[Water hardness|soft]], low in mineral content, and free of toxic substances.<ref>[http://www.mlgw.com/images/2005_wateranalysis.pdf MLGW - 2005 Water Quality Table]</ref>

The core of Memphis is marked by five major districts, with smaller districts lying within their borders. These are [[Downtown Memphis, Tennessee|Downtown]], [[Midtown, Memphis|Midtown]], [[Raleigh, Memphis|North Memphis]], [[South Memphis, Memphis|South Memphis]], and [[East Memphis, Memphis|East Memphis]]. In recent decades the city has expanded further by annexing adjacent territories, so these names can be somewhat misleading to those who are unfamiliar to the area.

=== Crime ===
While in 2004, violent crime in Memphis was at a record low for more than a decade, that trend has changed.  In 2005, Memphis was ranked the 4th most dangerous city with a population of 500,000 or higher in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#500,000+ Morgan Quitno 2006 Crime Rankings]</ref>  Crime in Memphis increased in 2005, and has seen a dramatic rise in the first half of 2006.  Nationally, cities follow similar trends, and crime numbers tend to be cyclic.  Local experts and criminologists cite as possible causes to the rise in crime in Memphis to gang recruitment, and to a reduction of federal funding by 66% to the [[Memphis Police Department]].  

In the first half of 2006, robbery of businesses increased 52.5%, robbery of individuals increased 28.5%, and homicide increased 18% over the same period of 2005. The Memphis Police Department has responded with the initiation of Operation Blue C.R.U.S.H. (Crime Reduction Using Statistical History), which targets crime hotspots and repeat offenders.<ref>

=== Lifestyle ===
In 2007, [[Forbes]] recorded Memphis as the most sedentary city in America. Although Memphis has a slightly lower statistic on the [[BMI]] than the national average of 66% of Americans being overweight or worse off, Memphis holds other records that combine to make the most inactive city in the United States. When asked, 30% of people had not exercised regularly. Forbes also cited Memphis having only 16.1 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, as well as having a higher television watched per week per person amount at 41 hours (as opposed to the national average of 30 hours). A mention was also made of "favored Southern cuisine". <ref>{{cite journal

=== Cultural events and fairs ===
One of the largest celebrations in Memphis is [[Memphis in May]]. The month-long series of events promotes Memphis' heritage and outreach of its people far beyond the city's borders. Each year, Memphis in May honors a different country, highlighting various aspects of the honored nation's history and culture.  Since its founding, the economic and educational impact of Memphis in May has given a significant boost to the city each spring. The celebration includes a diverse mix, beginning during the first weekend of the month at Tom Lee Park, the site of the [[Beale Street Music Festival]]. During International Week, the city focuses on its honored country, part of a larger program in coordination with area schools to broaden cultural awareness among students. Other signature events of Memphis in May include the [[Regional variations of barbecue#Memphis|World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest]] (the largest pork barbecue cooking contest in the world)<ref>{{cite journal

[[Carnival Memphis]] (formerly known as the Memphis Cotton Carnival), is a series of parties and festivities staged every year by the Carnival Memphis Association and its member krewes (similar to that of [[Mardi Gras]]) during the early summer. Carnival salutes various aspects of Memphis and its industries, and is reigned over by the current year's secretly selected King & Queen of Carnival. Fall brings the [[Mid-South Fair]] to the city each year.

An arts festival, [http://www.cooperyoungfestival.com/ the Cooper-Young Festival], is held annually in September in the [[Cooper-Young, Memphis|Cooper-Young]] district of Midtown Memphis.  The event draws artists from all over North America, and includes art sales, contests, and displays. Since the late 1980s the Cooper-Young Festival has grown into one of Memphis' most anticipated events, with over 50,000 guests in recent years enjoying a mix of art, music and crafts presented by over 300 artisans from around the country. The festival celebrates the arts, people, culture and Memphis heritage. In addition to art, the festival includes sales of clothing, jewelry, live music, and gay novelty items. 

As a result of [[Hurricane Katrina]], in August 2005 Memphis co-hosted the [http://www.voodoomusicexperience.com Voodoo Music Experience], normally the centerpiece of [[Halloween]] festivities in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].  In 2006 the annual musical event returned to New Orleans.

=== The arts ===
Memphis is the home of founders and establishers of various American music genres, including Blues, Gospel, Rock n' Roll, and "sharecropper" country music (in contrast to the "rhinestone" country sound of Nashville). [[Johnny Cash]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[B. B. King]] were all getting their starts in Memphis in the 1950s. They are respectively dubbed the "King" of Country, Rock n' Roll, and Blues. Other famous musicians who either grew up or got their starts in the Memphis area include the [[Box Tops]], the [[Gentrys]], the [[Grifters]], [[Nights Like These]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Bobby "Blue" Bland]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[Lucero (band)]], [[Al Green]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Willie Mae Ford Smith]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Booker T. and the MGs]], [[Otis Redding]], Arthur Lee, [[The Blackwood Brothers]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Rufus Thomas]], [[Carla Thomas]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Sam and Dave]], [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[DJ Squeeky]], [[8 Ball & MJG]],Yo Gotti, [[Elise Neal]], [[Shawn Lane]], [[Terry Manning]], [[The Sylvers]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Anita Ward]] and "Father of the Blues" [[W.C. Handy]].

The Highland Strip is an area located near the University of Memphis and is known as a haven for the college crowd.  Venues such as [[Newby's]] bring in local musicians as well as nationally touring acts on a weekly basis.

Well-known writers from Memphis include Civil War historian [[Shelby Foote]] and playwright [[Tennessee Williams]], who wrote his first play on Snowden Street and saw it performed on Glenview Street.  

Memphis has also had a significant impact in the world of photography, [[William Eggleston]], the pioneer of color photography as a serious artistic medium and considered one of the greatest photographers of all time, still lives and works in Memphis. A number of younger photographers, including Huger Foote, are Memphians. Some other notable Memphis photographers are fashion photographer Jack Robinson and civil rights-era artist Ernest C. Withers. 

In the last decade, the art scene in Memphis has exploded.  The independent art scene has centered primarily in South Main, located in downtown Memphis on the trolley line.  More than a dozen art galleries have moved into the neighborhood, fueling a redevelopment boom that has expanded into new residential construction.  Perhaps the most interesting conversion has been the Power House, a former power plant near Central Station that has been transformed into contemporary art space.  The Cooper-Young neighborhood in Midtown is also home to several art galleries.  The Edge is a nascent arts neighborhood, located at the edge of downtown near Madison Avenue, Marshall, and Union Avenue.  The Edge is home to Memphis' Black Repertory Theater, world-famous Sun Studios, and Delta Axis, among others.

== Economy ==
The city's central location has led to much of its business development. Located on the Mississippi River and intersected by two [[Interstate highways]] and seven major U.S. highways, Memphis is ideally located for commerce among the transportation and shipping industry. The city is also home to the world's busiest cargo [[airport]], in terms of tonnage, which serves as the primary hub for [[Fed Ex Corporation|FedEx]] shipping. Due to its location, more major metro areas can be reached overnight from Memphis than any other city in the central U.S. Memphis has also developed as a major [[manufacturing]] center of textiles, heating equipment, pianos, and automobile and truck parts. Memphis Light, Gas and Water ("MLG&W") is also one of the largest municipal utilities in the [[United States]].

Memphis is home to a growing number of nationally and internationally known corporations, including approximately 150 businesses from 22 countries. This includes the corporate headquarters of [[Fed Ex Corporation|FedEx Corporation]], [[AutoZone Incorporated]] and [[International Paper]]. It is also, home to [[Fred's|Fred's Stores]] headquarters, a company which was named as one of the five fastest growing chain-stores by [[Forbes Magazine]]. Other corporations with a major presence in the area include [[Back Yard Burgers]], [[Belz Enterprises]], [[Buckeye Technologies]], [[First Horizon National Corporation]], [[Guardsmark]], [[Hohenberg Bros. Co.]], [[Harrah's]], [[Hilton Hotel|Hilton]], [[ServiceMaster]], and [[Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.]] [[Northwest Airlines]] also operates a major hub at [[Memphis International Airport]], with daily nonstop flights to [[Amsterdam]].

The [[entertainment industry|entertainment]] and [[film industry]] has also developed in recent years in the city. Several major motion pictures have been filmed in Memphis in recent years, including ''[[Making the Grade]]'' (1984), U2: Rattle & Hum, (1988) ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'' (1989), ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'' (1989), Trespass, (1991) ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'' (1993), ''[[A Family Thing]]'' (1996), ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), ''[[The Rainmaker (John Grisham)|The Rainmaker]]'' (1997), ''[[Cast Away]]'' (2000), ''[[The Queens of Comedy]]'' (2001), ''[[21 Grams]]'' (2003), ''[[Hustle & Flow]]'' (2005), ''[[Walk the Line]]'' (2005), ''[[Forty Shades Of Blue]]'' (2005), and ''[[Black Snake Moan (film)|Black Snake Moan]]'' (2007).

The city appeared in the top eight of the 50 best major metro areas in the U.S. for starting and growing a business in [[2000]], according to ''[[Inc. magazine]]''. ''Southern Business and Development'' magazine ranked Memphis as one of the most successful models for economic development in the south, also recognized the city as one of the top ten markets over the past decade.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Government ===
Memphis is governed by a mayor and thirteen council members, six elected at large from throughout the city and seven elected from geographic districts. In [[1995]], the council adopted a new district plan which changed council positions to all districts. This plan provides for nine districts, seven with one representative each and two districts with three representatives each.

The current [[mayor]] of the city of Memphis is Dr. [[W. W. Herenton]], a formidable and controversial local political figure. Dr. Herenton is currently serving his fourth consecutive term as Mayor. He was elected for the first time in [[1991]], when he became Memphis' first elected [[African American|black]] mayor. (J.O. Patterson, Jr., had previously served as mayor on an interim basis, thus preventing Herenton from actually being the first black mayor.)  Prior to his election, Dr. Herenton served for 12 years as the superintendent of [[Memphis City Schools]].

In recent years, there has been discussion of the potential of a merger of Shelby County and Memphis into a [[metropolitan government]], similar to that in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

Memphis politics have been very racially--and ideologically--polarized for many years. Most whites have supported the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] since the 1960s, while most blacks have remained loyal to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. A major influence in Memphis' black politics is the Ford family of funeral directors, whose political prominence dates to the Crump era. The best-known member of this family is [[Harold Ford, Sr.]], who represented most of Memphis in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] from [[1975]] to [[1997]]. His brother, [[John Ford (politician)|John]], was a [[Tennessee State Senate|state senator]] for 30 years and is currently at the center of the [[Operation Tennessee Waltz|Tennessee Waltz]] scandal.

The greater part of Memphis is within the [[Tennessee's 9th congressional district|Ninth Congressional District]], which is represented by the liberal Democrat [[Steve Cohen]].  Cohen is the first white Democrat to represent a significant portion of Memphis in over 40 years.  The previous representative, [[Harold Ford, Jr.]], unsuccessfully ran for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat vacated by [[Bill Frist]]. Much of east Memphis is in the [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district|7th District]], represented by the conservative Republican [[Marsha Blackburn]].

=== Academic institutions ===

=== Bridges ===
[[Image:154146pv.jpg|thumb|Memphis-Arkansas Memorial Bridge, Frisco Bridge, Harahan Bridge]]
Four rail and highway bridges cross the Mississippi River at Memphis.  They are, in order of construction: the Frisco, Harahan, Memphis-Arkansas, and Hernando de Soto Bridges. The piers of the first three bridges had to be lined up for river navigation as they were built side-by-side at a narrow point in the river.

The Frisco Bridge (May 12, 1892) was the longest bridge in North America when it opened and was originally called the ''Great Bridge at Memphis''. This cantilever truss steel railroad bridge was built between 1888–1892.  It was designed by George S. Morison, who also designed the Taft Bridge in Washington D.C.

The Harahan Bridge (July 14, 1916) is a trestle railroad bridge to which later were added narrow, one-way wooden cantilevering roadways along the outsides of bridge so it could be used for cars. In 1928, sparks from a train ignited and set on fire to one of the wooden plank roads. Today, only trains use the Harahan Bridge but there are plans to add a pedestrian walkway and bike path.

The Memphis-Arkansas Bridge (December 17, 1949), originally named E. H. Crump Bridge, carries Interstate 55 and has a pedestrian walkway. The bridge was built between 1945–1949 and is the longest Warren truss- style bridge in the United States. It is listed on the National Historic Register.

The Hernando de Soto Bridge (August 2, 1973) with its steel arches carries I-40. In 1986, "M" shaped lights became part of the bridge and a Memphis landmark. The Guinness Book of World Records list the deSoto bridge for its unique structural "letter" shape.  In [[2001]] the mysterious disappearance and death of [[Harvard University]] biophysicist  [[Don Wiley]], whose abandoned car was found on the bridge, brought the Hernando de Soto Bridge national headlines.<ref>[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/news/wiley.html Don C.
