'''Fly to the Sky''' ({{lang-ko|플라이 투 더 스카이}}) is a [[South Korea]]n [[R&B]] [[Duet (music)|duo]], consisting of [[United States|U.S.]]-born [[Brian Joo]] and South Korean native [[Hwanhee]].

Initially marketed as a duo that can sing, [[rap]], and dance, their early works featured [[bubblegum pop]] and upbeat [[techno music]].<ref name="twovoices">{{cite web | url=http://listen.daum.net/info/singerinfo.asp?areaKubunCode=A&artistNo=0900988&tFlag=7&dFlag=Y&article_id=4337 | title=Fly to the Sky: Two voices, two attractions, second start...

==Musical career==
===1999-2001: Debut and the early years===
[[Image:Flytotheskyearlyyrs.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Fly to the Sky before their musical transition. In this photo taken in 2001, the duo sports shiny jackets and highlights.]]
The duo was formed in late 1998 by [[SM Entertainment]]. Brian Joo auditioned while he was attending [[Holy Spirit High School (New Jersey)|Holy Spirit High School]] in [[New Jersey]]. Hwang Yoon-Suk, later to be known as Fany, was encouraged to audition by a staff member working for the label at his high school festival. Fly to the Sky officially debuted on [[November 21]] [[1999]] at the LOG-IN [[H.O.T.]] Concert and SM Festival Concert '99.

Soon after, the duo released their debut album ''[[Day by Day (Fly to the Sky album)|Day by Day]]'' on [[December 9]] [[1999]], and made their first official television appearance two days later. Unlike their predecessors on their label, popular [[teen idols]] at that time, they shied away from upbeat [[techno]] and [[dance music]], opting for mid-tempo ballads. The debut became highly successful selling over 250,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_200004.htm | year=2000 | month=April | title=2000.04월 - 가요 음반 판매량 (Record Sales of April 2000) | publisher=Music Industry Association Korea | language=Korean | accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref> The duo acquired status as the next-generation stars as they won Best New Artist award in 2000.<ref name="Fly to the Sky artist review" /> At the same time, the duo failed to rise to instant stardom unlike their predecessors such as [[H.O.T.]], whose album sales have passed the one million mark.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_199912.htm | title=1999.12월 - 가요 음반 판매량 (Record Sales of December 1999) | accessdate=2006-12-24 | year=1999 | month=December | publisher=Music Industry Association Korea }}</ref>

Their popularity slowly climbed with the release of their second album [[The Promise (Fly to the Sky album)|''The Promise'']] in 2001, which featured more diverse genres than its predecessor. With more upbeat tracks, it peaked at #2, but quickly disappeared from the charts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_200102.htm | year=2001 | month=February | title=2001.02월 - 가요 음반 판매량 (Record Sales of February 2001) | publisher=Music Industry Association Korea | accessdate=2006-12-24 | language=Korean}}</ref> In the same year, they held a joint concert with Korean R&B singer Kim Jo-Han.

{{sample box end}}
In April 2002, their third album ''[[Sea of Love (Fly to the Sky album)|Sea of Love]]'' was released while Joo was in [[New Jersey]] attending [[Rutgers University]]. As a result, Hwang began to perform by himself until Brian returned to Korea. The lead single from the album was the title track, a poppy ballad, and it became a summer hit. Their second single "Condition of my Heart" was written by American singer [[Brian McKnight]]; in contrast to the first single, "Condition" was a heavier ballad. The single signaled the duo's musical transition from bubblegum music to R&B. Along with their music, their image began to change as the duo traded in their "[[bishounen]]" look for a more masculine image.

Their 2003 studio album ''[[Missing You (Fly to the Sky album)|Missing You]]'' featured more tracks that departed from [[bubblegum music]] and emphasized their vocal skills for an image as serious artists. Performing commercially well, the album gave the duo many awards including "Bonsang" award from [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] Gayo Daejun and Korea Music Awards. This period is remembered for the highly publicized death of their manager, who was also the manager of  [[BoA]], another Korean singer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.media.daum.net/entertainment/music/200307/09/hankookis/v4567115.html | title=보아, 매니저 교통사고 사망 '통곡' (BoA mourns death of her manager) | language=Korean | date=2003-07-09 | accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref> On a [[variety show]], both members recalled this incident as an emotionally hard time for them. Fany was especially shocked, because he was on the same vehicle with his manager just hours before the incident.

In November 2004, the duo released their fifth and last studio album under SM Entertainment, ''[[Gravity (Fly to the Sky album)|Gravity]]''. The album received little promotion, and became the duo's lowest-selling studio album, selling just below 90,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_2004.htm | title=2004 Yearly Chart | accessdate=2006-11-20 | year=2004 | month=December | publisher= Music Industry Association Korea | language=Korean}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_2005.htm | title=2005 Yearly Chart | accessdate=2006-11-20 | year=2005 | month=December | publisher=Music Industry Association Korea | language=Korean}}</ref> Nevertheless, they held their first official concert successfully in [[Jamsil Arena]] on [[December 21]], [[2004]], and received "Best R&B Artist" award from SBS Gayo Daejun.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tvnews.media.daum.net/entertv/200412/31/etn/v8053530.html | language=Korean | title=다양한 장르, 정상급 가수들의 뜨거운 경합 Diverse Genres, Intense battle between top-notch artists | accessdate=2006-12-24 | date=2004-12-31}}</ref> A controversy rose as critics questioned their eligibility for the award, because the album was released only two months before the show. They challenged the credibility and fairness of SBS Gayo Daejun in its entirety as the artists who boycotted SBS such as [[YG Family]] or those who were not present did not receive any awards. They scorned the show as "a party for only those who were present."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.groonet.com/01_news/news_view.asp?board_id=HotLine&oid=8981&searchstring=%C0%DA%BF%EC%B8%B2  | title=플라이투더스카이가 상을? 2개월 활동했는데? 찝찝한 결과...

The release of their [[Greatest hits]] album ''Eternity'' in 2005 coincided with the release of the soundtrack of Korean drama ''Fashion 70s'' which featured the duo. The popular Korean show made their song "가슴 아파도" ("Although My Heart Aches"), the theme song of the show, an unexpected hit.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.media.daum.net/entertain/music/200506/09/segye/v9295414.html | title=드라마 ''패션70s'' 주제곡 뜬다 Drama Fashion 70s Theme Song becomes a hit | date=2005-06-09 | accessdate=2006-12-24 | language=Korean}}</ref> ''Eternity'' is the last Fly to the Sky album released by SM Entertainment.

===2004-2006: Leaving SM Entertainment and personal struggles===
After Fly to the Sky's contract with SM Entertainment expired in November 2004, the duo signed on with PFull Entertainment. The duo stated that they wanted a smaller label that was willing to promote them as musicians and focus less on commercial success.<ref name="twovoices" /> Under this label, Fly to the Sky released their sixth studio album ''Transition'' after a year-long hiatus in January 2006. The album became massively successful, selling over 160,000 copies.

The duo embarked on their first nationwide tour, "Fly To The Sky: 2006 The Twice Tour". Starting from Jamsil Arena in [[Seoul]] in May 2006, they held concerts in [[Busan]], [[Daegu]], Junju, and [[Kwangju]]. Including the number of audiences in the encore concert in Seoul, the tour garnered more than 50,000 people.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://star.moneytoday.co.kr/view/stview.php?no=2006053108302573769&type=1 | title=플라이투더스카이, 음반활동 종료..개인활동 돌입 (Fly to the Sky takes a hiatus and starts individual activities) | language=Korean | accessdate=2006-12-24 | language=2006-05-31 }}</ref> 

To commemorate the success of ''Transition'', Fly To The Sky released a special new edition, which included music videos, deleted scenes and the additional tracks "Hwan Sang (Illusion)," "Hot and Cold," and "When I Say."

In 2004 and 2005, the duo's uncertain future after their contract with SM Entertainment led to a speculation that they would disband.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.dreamwiz.com/BIN/viewnews.cgi?cm=2&id=20060219&se=11&ki=newsen&fn=200602191835111835292.html  | title=브라이언 왜 생방송 도중 눈물 흘렸나 (Why did Brian shed tears on a live show?) | accessdate=2006-12-24 | language=Korean | date=2006-02-19}}</ref> Brian Joo publicly addressed the rumours on [[SBS (Korea)|SBS]] show "Yah Shim Man Man," which aired on July 10. He admitted that the two had difficulties in the early days of their career and said that he had been troubled by feelings of inferiority to Fany, because he received more attention and praise than him.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> Despite their status as a duo, he felt that he was not given his due or the same amount of attention as Hwang. Eventually he found this difficult to bear, and suggested to him that they pursue their separate paths. Hwang responded angrily and the matter escalated into a serious fight nearly leading to disbandment. The two reconciled soon after, and said they "grew to better understand each other and realized that they both needed each other.<ref>{{cite news

After reflecting on this incident, Joo's eyes were brimming with tears.

Since 2006, the duo has been seen frequently on variety shows and pursued individual careers. Hwang appeared on [[Korean television drama]] "Over the Rainbow" during summer of 2006, and Joo released his solo album ''[[The Brian]]'' in December 2006. As they appeared more often on non-music programs, the duo saw an increase in their popularity and backlash from critics at the same time as they felt the duo were compromising their image as artists.<ref name="castallthesame">{{cite news

===2007-present: ''No Limitations''===

The duo's seventh album ''[[No Limitations]]'' was release on [[July 4]] [[2007]].

Fany starred in the [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] series ''[[Over the Rainbow (TV series)|Over the Rainbow]]'' with co-stars Kim Ok-Bin and Ji Hyun Woo. The series first aired on July 26, 2006, and ended on its 16th episode on September 14, 2006. Fany's portrayal of cocky rock star Rex, the protagonist of the show, was met with mixed reviews. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.media.daum.net/entertain/music/200607/30/joynews24/v13534988.html | title=환희, 연기 변신 평가 '나쁘지 않네' (Reaction towards Fany's acting: Not bad!) | accessdate=2006-12-24 | date=2006-07-30 | language=Korean}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.media.daum.net/entertain/broadcast/200608/04/mydaily/v13592554.html | title=환희, 연기력 부족 문제 있다.

After the contract to SM Entertainment expired, the duo, Brian in particular, has appeared frequently on [[variety shows]] since 2005. Brian became one of two [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]]s for MBC's "Music Core" on [[May 6]] [[2006]]. This helped Brian gain publicity and expand his fanbase in ways he could not have in the early days of his career. After the duo officially took a hiatus from their sixth album, Brian continues to appear on variety shows such as Love Letter, and is still the MC of ''Music Core''.

Brian's solo album was released [[December 18]] [[2006]]. Brian performed his first single, "Gajima" (''Don't Go'') on Mnet Countdown on December 7.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.media.daum.net/entertain/music/200612/08/mydaily/v14984442.html | title=브라이언 "환희와의 비교에 우울증" (Brian, "Comparison with Fany brought depression) | accessdate=2006-12-24 | date=2006-12-08 | language=Korean}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.media.daum.net/entertain/music/200609/28/poctan/v14187998.html | title=브라이언, "솔로 앨범서 올드팝 선보일 것" (Brian to showcase classic pop) | accessdate=2006-12-24 | date=2006-09-28 | language=Korean}}</ref>

==Musical style==
The duo's debut single "Day by Day" was a light bubblegum [[love song]]. Their subsequent songs were a combination of R&B, [[pop rap]], and [[hip-hop]] until 2002, when the duo abandoned bubblegum pop. Since 2002, they opted for a blend of heavy R&B and [[Korean pop]]. They continue to sing love songs, and some of them continue to incorporate hip-hop and rap from Brian.

The duo differs in their taste of music. Producer of ''Transition'', Hwang Se-Jun, has said Fany prefers pure R&B while Brian likes music with distinct beats and has a strong liking for rap.<ref name="6집으로 돌아온 Fly to the Sky (Fly to the Sky Returning with Sixth Album)">{{cite web |url= http://www.melon.com/juice/themeZone/WhatsHotReview.jsp?whId=7|title= Fly to the Sky Transition|accessdate=2006-10-28 |last= Cho|first= Won-kyung|authorlink= |coauthors= Kim Ha-rim|date= |year= 2006|month= |format= HTML|work= |publisher= |pages= |language= Korean|archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Despite his passion, their 2006 studio album ''Transition'' does not feature any. Brian predicts that there will no longer be any opportunity to include his rap in their album, and dislikes "being generalized as a duo comprised of one rapper and one vocalist." He lamented the waning popularity of hip-hop in South Korea where "hip-hop is merely labeled as dance music in Korea."<ref name="twovoices" />

==Criticisms==
Prior to the duo's transition to R&B, critics were displeased as despite being promoted as serious artists that appeal to older audiences, they felt that the duo was no different from other popular teen idols at that time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.izm.co.kr/menu_view.asp?view=1&key=1&idx=340 | title=Fly to the Sky at IZM.com | year=2005 | month=July | accessdate=2006-12-24 | language=Korean}}</ref> In a lengthy interview with music review site "52street", the site described the duo in the early years as, "trendy hairstyle, thick make-up, and flashy dance moves."<ref name="twovoices" />

As their career matured, critics have pointed that Fly to the Sky has yet to find their own style. The duo has been criticized for lack of creative control over their works and relying heavily on composers whose distinct styles overpower their vocals.<ref name="albumreviewtransition">{{cite web | url=http://www.izm.co.kr/menu_view.asp?key=1&idx=13809&a_idx=340&view=2 | title=Album Review Transition | accessdate=2006-10-28 | author=Hye-rim Shin year=2006|month=February | language= Korean}}</ref> During their career they have written lyrics for four songs in albums ''Gravity'' and ''No Limitations."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://listen.daum.net/info/singerinfo.asp?areaKubunCode=A&artistNo=0900988&tFlag=5&dFlag=Y&kubun=1&no=8013  | title=4집 - Missing You | accessdate=2006-12-24 | author=Joong-Suk Yang | year=2006 | month=August | publisher=oimusic | language=Korean}}</ref><ref name="albumreviewtransition" /> Music critic Shin Hye Rim says,<ref name="albumreviewtransition" />

{{cquote|Ironically, Fly to the Sky's sixth album ''Transition'', which means change or transformation, shows no significant improvement. Despite that this album is their first step under their new label, the album almost turns out just the way we have predicted. Fany's thick tone color and Brian's clean-cut voice fuse to make music that spits out sorrow. That's about it.}}

Their appearances at variety shows were met with scrutiny as the duo were seen frequently outside of music programs during 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.media.daum.net/snews/entertain/broadcast/200603/24/reviewstar/v12152943.html | title=플라이 투 더 스카이, 오락 프로그램서도 종횡무진 ‘플라이!’ | accessdate=2006-12-24 | date=2006-03-24 | language=Korean}}</ref> They were one of many artists who hopped on a bandwagon to promote their albums by appearing comical on variety shows.

He appeared in television shows of three major broadcasting networks of Korea during the same time slot on January 6 and January 29.<ref name="castallthesame" />
