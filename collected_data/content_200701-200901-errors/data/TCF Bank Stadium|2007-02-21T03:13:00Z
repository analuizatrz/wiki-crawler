'''TCF Bank Stadium''' is the future [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] for the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]. Plans call for a 50,000 seat on-campus "horseshoe" style stadium to be built in time for the 2009 football season. The stadium will be designed to support future expansion to seat up to 80,000 people. The estimated cost of the project originated at [[United States dollar|$]]248 million, but has since risen to $288.5 million. The state of [[Minnesota]] will be paying approximately 48% of the cost, while the University will fund the remaining amount.  Of the University's share, $35 million will be provided from naming rights by [[TCF Bank]], $10 million will be generated by the sale of 3000 acres (12 km²) of University land back to the state, and the remaining will be raised through a combination of private donations and a $25 per year student fee.

==Stadium info==
===Location===
TCF Bank Stadium will be constructed near the site of the former [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]]. The new stadium's site has been the location of the Huron Boulevard Parking Complex, where the University's four largest surface parking lots are located.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Stadium Location  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = 2006-07-18  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/location.html#  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref> The street address of the stadium will be ''2009 University Avenue SE''.  On [[December 7]], [[2006]], the University announced that the stadium's field will be laid out in an east-west configuration, with the open end of the stadium facing campus.  This layout, similar to that of Memorial Stadium, will provide a view of downtown Minneapolis.<ref name="stribmjs">{{cite news  | last = Smetanka  | first = Mary Jane  | title = Gophers' stadium costs expected to rise  | language = English  | publisher = Star Tribune  | date = 2006-12-07  | url = http://www.startribune.com/512/story/861532.html  | accessdate =  }}</ref>

The stadium is part of a 75-acre expansion of the Twin Cities campus, the largest since the [[University_of_Minnesota#West_Bank|West Bank]] was built in the 1960s. Current plans for the area call for the construction of as many as 10 new academic buildings by 2015.<ref name="stribmjs" /> The proposed [[Central Corridor]] light-rail transit line is expected to run near the stadium, with a station in [[Stadium Village, Minneapolis|Stadium Village]] serving the facility. Construction of the Central Corridor is scheduled to begin in 2010 and be completed by 2014.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Central Corridor Light-Rail Transit Factsheet  | publisher = Metropolitan Council  | date = December, 2006  | url = http://metrocouncil.org/about/facts/CentralCorridorFacts.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>

===Construction===
On [[June 8]], [[2006]], the University announced that it had selected [[HOK Sport + Venue + Event|HOK Architects]] to design TCF Bank stadium. <ref>{{cite news   | last = Kazuba  | first = Mike  | title = Kansas City firm chosen to design Gophers' new stadium  | language = English  | publisher = Minneapolis Star Tribune  | date = [[June 8]], [[2006]]  | url = http://www.startribune.com/512/story/480963.html  | accessdate = 2006-06-08 }}</ref> HOK Architects was one of the three finalists, along with HNTB Architects and Crawford Architects, that made presentations to the University on [[May 24]], [[2006]]. The local firm working on the project is Minneapolis based '''Architectural Alliance'''; '''M.A. Mortenson Company''' is the [[general contractor]].<ref name="btc">{{cite web  | title = Back to Campus  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/index.php  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = University selects M.A. Mortenson Company as general contractor | publisher = University of Minnesota | url = http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=38605&SPID=3280&DB_OEM_ID=8400&ATCLID=798968 | accessdate = 2007-02-20}}</ref>

Infrastructure work at the stadium site began in late June, 2006.  A ceremonial groundbreaking took place at the stadium site on [[September 30]], [[2006]], but the construction of the stadium itself will not begin until July of 2007.<ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium™ Construction PHASE 3  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/phase3.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>

===Other potential uses===
While TCF Bank Stadium will be the game day venue of the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Golden Gophers football team]], the University has identified a number of other anticipated uses for the facility.  The stadium will replace [[Northrop Auditorium]] as the home of the [[University of Minnesota Marching Band]], providing the band with new storage, rehearsal and locker facilities.  The University also expects to use the stadium for intramural sports, career fairs, and graduation cememonies.  Potential non-University uses include [[Minnesota State High School League]] state tournaments, concerts, and marching band/drum corps competitions.<ref>{{cite book |last= University of Minnesota |title= University of Minnesota On-Campus Football Stadium - Final EIS |year= 2003}}</ref>

If [[Chicago]] wins the [[Chicago 2016 Olympic bid|bid]] to host the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], it is possible that TCF Bank Stadium will host preliminary Olympic [[Football (soccer)|soccer]] matches.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Fuller  | first = Marcus | title = New football stadium might help U host 2016 Olympic soccer| publisher = St. Paul Pioneer Press  | date = 2007-01-12  | url = http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/colleges/16441193.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-13  }}</ref>

If the [[Minnesota Vikings]] successfully carry out a plan to have the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] demolished and have a new stadium built on the site, TCF Bank Stadium could possibly be temporary home to the Vikings until such a stadium is completed. <ref>http://www.startribune.com/510/story/945971.html</ref>

==Funding==
===Legislative action===
The push for a new on campus stadium started in the fall of 2003. By that December, the University had unveiled drawings and a general plan to seek state money and donations. On [[March 24]], [[2005]], the University and [[TCF Bank]] announced a [[naming rights]] deal that would have the bank contribute $35 million toward the project.  The deal was given an expiration date of [[December 31]], [[2005]], time enough for the Minnesota Legislature to provide the bulk of funding needed to make the project a reality. During 2005 the University worked to put together a legislative stadium proposal that would be supported by not only the University, but state politicians as well.  The final projections had the state of [[Minnesota]] contributing 40% of the cost while the University would raise the remaining 60%.<ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Financial Corporation gives $35 million  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = 2005-03-24  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Gophers_new_TCF_Bank_Stadium.html  | accessdate = 2006-01-10 }}</ref>Portions of that 60% were to be funded by the TCF naming rights, with the remainder coming from a $50 per semester student fee and private donations.  

Even though the University proposal drew widespread legislative support, the stadim effort suffered a setback when the 2005 legislative session ended before the stadium bill could be heard.<ref name ="leg">{{cite web  | title = At the Legislature  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/legislature.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>  Late in 2005 when it became evident that this would happen, the University and TCF Bank announced that it had extended the naming rights deal to [[June 30]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Stadium sponsorship agreement with TCF extended  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = 2005-12-28  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Stadium_sponsorship_agreement_with_TCF_extended.html  | accessdate = 2005-12-28 }}</ref>

Despite the 2005 session ending without the bill even being heard, the stadium effort did not lose momentum and picked back up in 2006 right where it had left off the previous year.  On [[April 6]], [[2006]], the Minnesota House of Representatives debated and then passed the stadium bill on a 103-30 vote.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for H.F. NO. 263   | publisher = Minnesota House of Representatives  | date = 2006-04-06  | url = http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/votes/votes.asp?ls_year=84&session_number=0&year=2005&id=564  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>  The house bill was nearly identical to what the University was proposing and had full University support.  However on [[May 9]], [[2006]], the Minnesota Senate passed a radically different verision of the bill by a 34-32 vote.<ref>{{cite journal  | title = Permanent Journals of the 2006 Regular Session   | journal = Journal of the Senate   | volume = 2005 - 2006  | issue = Eighty-Fourth Legislature  | pages = 5332  | publisher = Minnesota State Senate  | date = 2006-05-09  | url = http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/journals/2005-2006/20060509103.pdf  | id = Legislative Day 103  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref> The Senate version would have removed the TCF naming rights deal, the student fees, and the proposed purchase of 3000 acres (12 km²) of University owned land in rural [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]].  The proposed funding that was removed was to be replaced with a state wide tax on sport memorabilia. It also would have required the stadium to be named Veterans Memorial Stadium (which would be similar to the previous on-campus football stadium [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]], which was last used in 1981 and then demolished in 1992). Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] stated he supported the House version.  

Even though the differences between the house and senate bills were major, the details were ironed out and approved on [[May 19]], [[2006]] in a House - Senate conference committee.  The TCF Bank naming rights and land sale remained in the bill, as did a scaled down $25 per year student fee (the student fee could be abolished completely if enough private donations are gathered).  The tax on sports memorabilia as well as the Veterans Memorial Stadium name were voted out.  The committee also voted to increase the state contribution to make up for smaller student fees.  The bill was then approved by both the full house and senate on [[May 20]], [[2006]], and was signed by Governor Tim Pawlenty on [[May 24]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for S.F.
