A '''pseudoscorpion''', (also known as a ''false scorpion'' or ''book scorpion''), is an [[arachnid]] belonging to the order '''Pseudoscorpionida''', also known as Pseudoscorpiones or Chelonethida.

==Physical characteristics==
Pseudoscorpions are small arthropods with a flat, pear-shaped body and pincers that resemble those of [[scorpion]]s. They range from 2 to 8&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] ({{frac|1|12}} to ⅓&nbsp;[[inch]]) in length.<ref name=Penn>"[http://www.ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/pseudoscorpion.htm Entomological Notes: Pseudoscorpion Fact Sheet]", [[Pennsylvania State University]], Department of Entomology</ref>

The abdomen, known as the [[opisthosoma]], is made up of twelve segments, each guarded by plate-like [[tergite]]s above and [[sternite]]s below. The abdomen is short and rounded at the rear, rather than extending into a segmented tail and stinger like true scorpions. The color of the body can be yellowish-tan to dark-brown, with the paired claws often a contrasting color. They may have two, four or no eyes.<ref name="Wolf">Read, Wolf. [http://www.sff.net/people/windrummer/ReadWebSite/psdoscrp.html Pseudoscorpions].</ref> 

A pseudoscorpion has eight legs with five to seven segments — the number of fused segments is used to distinguish families and genera. They have two very long ''palpal chelae'' ([[pedipalp]]s or pincers) which strongly resemble the pincers found on a scorpion. 

The pedipalps generally consist of an immobile "hand" and "finger", with a separate movable finger controlled by an [[adductor muscle]]. A [[venom (poison)|venom]] gland and duct are usually located in the mobile finger; the poison is used to capture and immobilize the pseudoscorpion's prey. During digestion, pseudoscorpions pour a mildly corrosive fluid over the prey, then ingest the liquefied remains.

Pseudoscorpions spin [[silk]] from a gland in their jaws to make disk-shaped [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s for mating, molting, or waiting out cold weather. Another trait they share with their closest relatives, the [[spider]]s, is breathing through [[spiracle]]s. Most spiders have one pair of spiracles, and one of [[book lungs]], but pseudoscorpions do not have book lungs.

==Geographical distribution==
There are more than 3,300 species of pseudoscorpions recorded, with more being discovered on a regular basis. They range worldwide, even in temperate to cold regions like [[Michigan]] and above timberline in Wyoming's Rocky Mountains in the [[United States]], but have their most dense and diverse populations in the [[tropical|tropics]] and subtropics. ''Chelifer cancroides'' is the species most commonly found in homes. Other species have been found under tree bark, in leaf and pine litter, in soil, in tree hollows, under stones, in caves, at the seashore in the intertidal zone, and within fractured rocks.<ref name=Penn /> There have even been reports of pseudoscorpions in domestic refrigerators.<ref name=McDonald />

==Evolution==
Until recently, the oldest pseudoscorpion [[fossil]]s known were only 35 million years old, but some have now been found dating back over ten times as far, 380 million years, to the [[Devonian]] period, near the time when the first land-animal fossils appear. This is not surprising, however, since they are more closely related to [[spider]]s than real [[scorpion]]s, and yet of course could not have branched off from spiders before the latter lost any pinchers their ancestors may have had. Since spiders gained their modern traits in the early Devonian, it's entirely possible that pseudoscorpions were actually around long before even the 380 million year old fossil.

[[Image:ar_1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A book scorpion could get lost in a book.]]
This is also supported by the advanced nature of that oldest fossil; it has all of the traits of a modern pseudoscorpion, rather than being some kind of primitive transitional stage on its way to developing the features of this group. This is also not-unusual, as many of the very first land-[[arthropod]] fossils show advanced terrestrial features, giving the impression that they had been on land a long time, but simply not preserved as fossils up to that time. Part of this would be a result of geological activity; the suitable land areas have mostly become seabeds, or been subsumed entirely into the mantle by [[continental drift]]. Indeed, fossils from the very earliest land animals are extremely rare already, for those very reasons; going back slightly farther, mere chance could result in few or no fossils surviving.

==Growth==
During the elaborate [[mating dance]], the male of some pseudoscorpion species pulls a female over a [[spermatophore]] previously laid upon a surface.<ref>Weygoldt, Peter. "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/153/3744/1647 Spermatophore Web Formation in a Pseudoscorpion]" [[Duke University]] Marine Laboratory, [[Beaufort, North Carolina]].</ref> In other species, the male also pushes the sperm into the female genitals using the forelegs.<ref>Proctor, Heather C. "[http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v21_n2/JoA_v21_p156.pdf Mating biology resolves trichotomy for cheliferoid pseudoscorpions (Pseudoscorpionida, Cheliferoidea)]", Journal of Arachnology, Vol. 21, No. 2, (1993)</ref>

The female carries the fertilized eggs in a [[brood pouch]] attached to her [[abdomen]], and the young ride on the mother for a short time after they hatch.<ref name=Penn /> Up to two dozen young are hatched in a single [[brood]]; there may be more than one brood per year. The young go through three [[ecdysis|molts]] over the course of several years before reaching adulthood. Adult pseudoscorpions live 2 to 3 years. They are active in the warm months of the year, overwintering in silken cocoons when the weather grows cold. 

Pseudoscorpions are generally beneficial to humans since they prey on [[moth|clothes moth]] larvae, [[carpet beetle]] larvae, [[Psocoptera|booklice]], [[ant]]s, [[mite]]s, and small [[Diptera|flies]]. They are small and inoffensive, and are rarely seen due to their size. They usually enter the home by "riding along" with larger insects (known as phoresy), or are brought in with firewood. They are often observed in bathrooms or laundry rooms, since they seek humidity. They may sometimes be found feeding on mites under the wing covers of certain beetles.

== Classification == 
This classification is based on that of Muchmore (1982).<ref name="Wolf">Read, Wolf. [http://www.sff.net/people/windrummer/ReadWebSite/psdoscrp.html Pseudoscorpions].</ref>
*Superfamily [[Chthonioidea]]
*Superfamily [[Neobisioidea]]
*Superfamily [[Cheiridioidea]]
*Superfamily [[Garypoidea]]
*Superfamily [[Feaelloidea]]
*Superfamily [[Cheliferoidea]]

== Historical References ==
Pseudoscorpions were first described by [[Aristotle|Aristotle]], who probably found them among scrolls in a library where they would have been feeding on [[Psocoptera|booklice]]. The next reference to them seems to be from the 1780s, when [[George_Adams_%28optician%29|George Adams]] wrote of: "A lobster-insect, spied by some labouring men who were drinking their porter, and borne away by an ingenious gentleman, who brought it to my lodging." <ref>Adams, George. Essays on the Microscope. First edition. (London: Robert Hindmarsh, 1787)</ref>
