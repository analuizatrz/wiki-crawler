[[Image:Lavrenti_Beria.jpg|thumb|200px|Lavrenty Beria]]
'''Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ლავრენტი ბერია, Lavrenti Pavles dze Beria; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Лаврентий Павлович Берия; [[29 March]], [[1899]] – [[23 December]], [[1953]]) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] politician and chief of the Soviet security and police apparatus.

Beria is now remembered chiefly as the executor of [[Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin's]] [[Great Purge]] of the [[1930s]], even though he actually presided only over the closing stages of the purge. He was most influential during and after [[World War II]] and immediately after Stalin's death, when he carried out a brief campaign of liberalization as First Deputy Prime Minister. This ended with his execution on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]].

==Rise to power==
Beria was born the son of Pavel Khukhaevich Beria, a peasant, in Merkheuli, near [[Sukhumi]] in the [[Abkhazia|Abkhazian]] region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], then part of [[Imperial Russia]].  He was a member of the [[Mingrelians|Mingrelian]] subgroup. He was educated at a technical school in Sukhumi, and is recorded as having joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] in March [[1917]] while an engineering student in [[Baku]]. 

In [[1920]] or [[1921]] (accounts vary) Beria joined the [[Cheka]] (All-Russian Extraordinary Commission to Combat Counter-Revolution and Sabotage), the original Bolshevik [[political police]]. At that time, a [[Bolshevik]] revolt, supported by the [[Red Army]], occurred in the [[Menshevik]] [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], and the Vecheka was heavily involved in [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|this conflict]]. By [[1922]] Beria was deputy head of the Vecheka's successor, the [[OGPU]] (Combined State Political Directorate), in Georgia. Some sources allege that Beria was at this time an agent of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and/or [[Turkey|Turkish]] intelligence services, but this has never been proven.

Beria was an ally of fellow Georgian Joseph Stalin in his rise to power within the Communist Party and the Soviet regime although he was not introduced to Stalin until 1926. Some historians, however, claim that he worked to further his own cause by wooing Stalin to get into the inner circles of the Soviet regime; and that he was hardly an "ally", more of a henchman{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In [[1924]] he led the repression of [[August Uprising in Georgia|nationalist disturbances in Georgia]], after which it is said that up to 10,000 people were executed. For this display of "Bolshevik ruthlessness" Beria was appointed head of the "secret-political division" of the [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasian]] OGPU and was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]]. In [[1926]] he became head of the Georgian OGPU. 
He was appointed Party Secretary in Georgia in [[1931]], and for the whole [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasian]] region in [[1932]]. He became a member of the [[Central Committee]] of the Communist Party in [[1934]]. During this time Beria also started to attack fellow members of Georgian Bolshevik party, particularly [[Gaioz Devdariani]], who was the Minister of Education of the Georgian SSR at the time. Both brothers of Devdariani, George and Shalva (they held important positions in Cheka and the Communist party of Georgia), were killed on the orders of Beria. Eventually, Gaioz was charged with violating [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58]] for alleged counter-revolutionary activities and was executed in 1938 by the orders of the [[NKVD troika]]. Even after moving on from Georgia, he continued to effectively control the republic's Communist Party until it was purged in July [[1953]].

By [[1935]] Beria was one of Stalin's most trusted subordinates. He cemented his place in Stalin's entourage with a lengthy oration "On the History of the Bolshevik Organisations in Transcaucasia" (later published as a book), which allegedly{{Fact|date=February 2007}} rewrote the history of Transcaucasian Bolshevism emphasizing Stalin's role in it. When Stalin's purge of the Communist Party and government began in [[1934]] after the assassination of [[Sergei Kirov]], Beria ran the purges in Transcaucasia, using the opportunity to settle many old scores in the politically turbulent Transcaucasian republics. In June [[1937]] he said in a speech: "Let our enemies know that anyone who attempts to raise a hand against the will of our people, against the will of the party of [[Lenin]] and Stalin, will be mercilessly crushed and destroyed".

==Beria at the NKVD==

[[Image:ac.beria3.jpg|thumb|250px|An official poster eulogising Beria]]

In August [[1938]] Stalin brought Beria to [[Moscow]] as deputy head of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs ([[NKVD]]), the ministry which oversaw the [[state security]] and police forces. Under [[Nikolai Yezhov]], the NKVD carried out prosecution of the perceived enemies of the state known as the [[Great Purge]] that affected millions of people. By [[1938]], however, the purge had become so extensive that it was damaging the infrastructure of the Soviet state, its economy and armed forces, and Stalin had decided to wind the purge down. In September Beria was appointed head of the Main Administration of State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD, and in November he succeeded Yezhov as head of NKVD (Yezhov was executed in [[1940]]). The NKVD itself was then purged, with half its personnel replaced by Beria loyalists, many of them from the [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasus]].

Beria's name has become closely identified with the Great Purge as well, but in fact he presided over the NKVD during an easing of the repression. Over 100,000 people were released from the labour camps, and it was officially admitted that there had been some injustices and "excesses" during the purges, which were blamed on Yezhov. Nevertheless this liberalisation was only relative: arrests and executions continued, and in [[1940]], as war approached, the pace of the purges again accelerated. During this period Beria supervised the deportations of population from [[Poland]] and the [[Baltic states]] following their occupation by Soviet forces. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In March [[1939]] Beria became a candidate member of the Communist Party's [[Politburo]]. Although he did not become a full member until [[1946]], he was already one of the senior leaders of the Soviet state. In [[1941]] Beria was made a Commissar General of State Security, a highest military-like rank within the Soviet police ranking system of that time.

In February [[1941]] he became a Deputy Chairman of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom), and in June, when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Soviet Union, he became a member of the [[State Defence Committee]] (GKO). During [[World War II]] he took on major domestic responsibilities, using the millions of people imprisoned in NKVD labour camps for wartime production. He took control of production of armaments and (with [[Georgy Malenkov]]) aircraft and aircraft engines. This was the beginning of Beria's alliance with Malenkov, which later became of central importance.

In [[1944]], as the Germans were driven from Soviet soil, Beria was in charge of dealing with the various ethnic minorities accused of collaboration with the invaders, including the [[Chechnia|Chechens]], the [[Ingushetia|Ingush]], the [[Crimean Tatars]] and the [[Volga Germans]]. All these were deported to Soviet [[Central Asia]]. See "[[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]".

In December [[1944]] Beria was also charged with supervision of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]. In this connection he ran the successful Soviet espionage campaign against [[United States]] [[Manhattan Project|atomic weapons programme]] which resulted in Soviets obtaining nuclear bomb technology, building and testing a bomb in [[1949]]. However his most important contribution (and arguably the main reason for putting him in charge) was providing a necessary workforce. The actual implementation of a nuclear project requires huge human resources for various support, often hazardous, works, not just a team of talented nuclear physicists. The Gulag system provided tens of thousands of workers for mining [[uranium]], construction and running of uranium processing plants, and construction of test facilities (at [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|Semipalatinsk]], [[Vaygach]], [[Novaya Zemlya]] and others). NKVD also ensured the necessary security and secrecy of the project. 

In July [[1945]], as Soviet police ranks were converted to a uniform military system, Beria's rank was converted to that of a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. Although he had never held a military command, Beria, through his organisation of war production, made a significant contribution to the Soviet Union's victory in World War II.

==Postwar politics==

[[Image:Lavrenti_Beria_Stalins_family.jpg|thumb|300px|Beria with Stalin (in background) and Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]]]

With Stalin nearing 70, the postwar years were dominated by a concealed struggle for the succession among his lieutenants. At the end of the war the most likely successor seemed to be [[Andrei Zhdanov]], party leader in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] during the war, then in charge of all cultural matters in [[1946]]. Even during the war Beria and Zhdanov had been rivals, but after [[1946]] Beria formed an alliance with Malenkov to block Zhdanov's rise{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

In January [[1946]] Beria left the post of the head of the [[NKVD]], while retaining general control over national security matters from his post of Deputy Prime Minister, under Stalin. The new head, [[Sergei Kruglov]], was not Beria's protégé. In addition, by the Summer of 1946, Beria's loyalist [[Vsevolod Merkulov]] was replaced by [[Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov|Viktor Abakumov]] as head of the [[MGB]]. Kruglov and Abakumov then moved expeditiously to replace the security apparatus leadership with new people outside of Beria's inner circle, such that very soon Deputy Minister of [[MVD]] [[Stepan Mamulov]] represented the only remnant of it outside foreign intelligence, on which Beria kept a grip. In the following months, Abakumov started carrying out important operations without consulting Beria, often working in tandem with Zhdanov, and sometimes on Stalin's direct orders. Some observers{{Fact|date=February 2007}} argue that these operations were aimed---initially tangentially, but with time more directly---at Beria.

One of the first such moves was the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] affair that commenced in October of 1946 and eventually led to the murder of [[Solomon Mikhoels]] and the arrest of many other members. The reason this campaign had negatively reflected on Beria was that not only did he champion{{Fact|date=February 2007}} creation of the committee in [[1942]], but his own entourage included a substantial number of Jews.

Zhdanov died suddenly in August [[1948]], and Beria and Malenkov then moved to consolidate their power with a purge of Zhdanov's associates known as the "[[Leningrad Affair]]". Among the more than 2,000 people executed {{Fact|date=March 2007}} were Zhdanov's deputy [[Aleksei Kuznetsov]], the economic chief [[Nikolai Voznesensky]], the Leningrad Party head [[Pyotr Popkov]] and the Prime Minister of the [[RSFSR|Russian Republic]], [[Mikhail Rodionov]]. It was only after Zhdanov's death that [[Nikita Khrushchev]] began to be considered as a possible alternative to the Beria-Malenkov axis.

Zhdanov's death did not, however, stop the anti-Semitic campaign. During the postwar years Beria supervised the establishment of Soviet-style systems of secret police, and hand-picked the leaders, in the countries of the [[Eastern Europe]]. A substantial number of these leaders were Jews. Starting in 1948, Abakumov initiated several investigations against these leaders, which culminated with the arrest in November of 1951 of [[Rudolf Slánský]], Bedřich Geminder, and others in [[Prague]], who were generally accused of [[Zionism]] and [[rootless cosmopolitan|cosmopolitanism]], but, more specifically, of using [[Czechoslovakia]] to funnel weapons to Israel. From Beria's standpoint, this charge was extremely explosive, because massive help to Israel was provided on his direct orders. Altogether, 14 leaders of Czechoslovakia, 11 of them Jewish, were tried, convicted, and executed in Prague (see [[Prague Trials]]). (Similar investigations have concurrently proceeded in Poland and other Soviet satellite countries.{{Fact|date=February 2007}})

Around that time, Abakumov was replaced by [[Semyon Ignatiev]], who further intensified the anti-Semitic campaign. On [[January 13]], [[1953]], the widest anti-semitic affair in the Soviet Union&mdash;that later came to be known as [[Doctors' plot]]&mdash;was initiated with an article in ''[[Pravda]]''. A number of the country's prominent Jewish doctors were accused of poisoning top Soviet leaders and arrested. Concurrently, an hysterical anti-Semitic propaganda campaign sprang in the mass-media. Altogether, 37 doctors (17 of them were Jewish) were arrested, and MGB, on Stalin's orders, started to prepare{{Fact|date=February 2007}} for the deportation, or worse, of the entire Jewish population to Russia's far east.

Days after Stalin's death, Beria freed all the arrested doctors, announced that the entire matter was fabricated, and indeed arrested the MGB functionaries directly involved. The anticipated deportation of Jews never took place.

Early in the 1950s, Stalin's growing mistrust of Beria echoed in the [[Mingrelian Affair]] in which many of Beria's protégés were purged in the [[Georgian SSR]], resulting in the decline of Beria's power in his native republic.

==After Stalin==
Stalin died on [[March 5]] [[1953]], four days after collapsing during the night following a dinner with Beria and other Soviet leaders. The political memoirs of Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], published in [[1993]], claim that Beria boasted to Molotov that he had poisoned Stalin. The story about murder of Stalin by Beria associates was elaborated by Russian writer and historian [[Edvard Radzinsky]] in his book ''Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents From Russia's Secret Archives'', based on interviews of a former Stalin's body guard, published memories, and other data. There is also evidence{{Fact|date=February 2007}} that for many hours after Stalin was found unconscious, he was denied medical help. It is possible that all the Soviet leaders agreed to allow Stalin, whom they all feared, to die.

After Stalin's death Beria was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister and reappointed head of the [[MVD]], which he merged with the [[MGB (USSR)|MGB]]. His close ally [[Georgy Malenkov|Malenkov]] was the new [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Prime Minister]] and initially the most powerful man in the post-Stalin leadership. Beria was the second most powerful leader and, given Malenkov's lack of real leadership qualities, was in a position to become the power behind the throne and ultimately leader himself. Khrushchev became Party Secretary, which was seen as a less important post than the Prime Ministership.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Beria was at the forefront of liberalization after Stalin's death. Beria publicly denounced the [[Doctors' plot]] as a "fraud," investigated and solved the murder of [[Solomon Mikhoels]], and effectuated an amnesty that freed over a million non-political prisoners from forced labour camps. In April he signed a decree banning the use of torture in Soviet prisons. He also signalled{{Fact|date=February 2007}} a more liberal policy towards the non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union. He persuaded the [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Presidium]] (as the Politburo had been renamed) and the Council of Ministers to urge the Communist regime in [[East Germany]] to allow liberal economic and political reforms. Beria maneuvered{{Fact|date=February 2007}} to marginalize the role of the party apparatus in the decision-making process in policy and economic matters.

Some writers have held{{Fact|date=February 2007}} that Beria's liberal policies after Stalin's death were a tactic to maneuver himself into power. Even if he was sincere, they argue, Beria's past made it impossible for him to lead a liberalizing regime in the Soviet Union, a role which later fell to Khrushchev. The essential task of Soviet reformers was to bring the secret police under party control, and Beria could not do this since the police were the basis of his own power.

Others have argued{{Fact|date=February 2007}} that he had represented a truly reformist agenda, and that his eventual removal from power delayed a radical political and economic reform in the Soviet Union by almost forty years.

[[Image:Beria timemag 1101530720 400.jpg|thumb|"Beria: [[Enemy of the people]]". [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] cover, [[July 20]] [[1953]]]]Given his record, it is not surprising that the other party leaders were suspicious of Beria's motives in all this. Khrushchev opposed the alliance between Beria and Malenkov, but he was initially unable to challenge the Beria-Malenkov axis. Khrushchev's opportunity came in June [[1953]] when demonstrations against the East German Communist regime broke out in [[East Berlin]] (see [[Workers Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]). There was a suspicion that the practical Beria was willing to trade the reunification of Germany and the end of the cold war for massive aid from the United States such as had been received in World War II. The East German demonstrations convinced Molotov, Malenkov and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] that Beria's policies were dangerous and destabilising to Soviet power. Within days of the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded the other leaders to support a party ''coup'' against Beria; even Beria's principal ally Malenkov abandoned him.

==Beria's fall==

Accounts of Beria's fall vary considerably. According to the most recent accounts{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Khrushchev convened a meeting of the Praesidium on [[June 26]], where he launched an attack on Beria, accusing him of being in the pay of British intelligence. Beria was taken completely by surprise. He asked, "What's going on, Nikita Sergeyevich?" Molotov and others then also spoke against Beria, and Khrushchev put a motion for his instant dismissal. Malenkov then pressed a button on his desk as the pre-arranged signal to Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] and a group of armed officers in a nearby room. They immediately burst in and arrested Beria. 

Beria was taken first to the [[Lefortovo prison]] and then to the headquarters of General [[Kirill Moskalenko]], commander of Moscow District Air Defence and a wartime friend of Khrushchev's. His arrest was kept secret until his principal lieutenants could be arrested. The NKVD troops in Moscow which had been under Beria's command were disarmed by regular Army units. ''[[Pravda]]'' announced Beria's arrest only on [[July 10]], crediting it to Malenkov and referring to Beria's "criminal activities against the Party and the State." In December it was announced that Beria and six accomplices, "in the pay of foreign intelligence agencies," had been "conspiring for many years to seize power in the Soviet Union and restore capitalism."

Beria was tried by a "special tribunal" with no defense counsel and no right of appeal. When the death sentence was passed, according to Moskalenko's later account, Beria begged on his knees for mercy, but he and his subordinates were immediately executed on [[23 December]] [[1953]].  (See ''Citizen Kurchatov'' documentary for more details on his death<ref name="PBS on Beria">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/opb/citizenk/coldwar/index.html|title=Citizen Kurchatov Stalin's Bomb Maker|work=PBS|accessdate=February 12|accessyear=2007}}</ref>). His burial location remains a mystery to this day.

However, according to other accounts including his son's{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, Beria's house was assaulted on [[26 June]] [[1953]], by military units and Beria himself was killed on the spot. A member of the special tribunal, [[Nikolay Shvernik]], has subsequently told Beria's son that he had never seen Beria alive.

Beria's wife and son were sent to a labour camp, but survived and were later released: his wife Nina died in 1991 in exile in Ukraine; his son Sergo died in October 2000 still defending his father's reputation. After Beria's death the [[MGB]] was separated from the [[MVD]] and reduced from the status of a Ministry to a Committee (known as the [[KGB]]), and no Soviet police chief ever again held the kind of power Beria had wielded.

In May [[2000]] the Supreme Court of [[Russia]] refused an application by members of Beria's family to overturn his [[1953]] conviction. The application was based on a Russian law that provided for rehabilitation of victims of false political accusations. The court ruled, however, that "Beria was the organizer of repression against his own people, and therefore could not be considered a victim".

==Sexual sadism==

Until recently dismissed as propaganda by political enemies both inside and outside the former Soviet Union, the allegations that Beria [[rape]]d women, and that he personally tortured and killed many of his political victims are gaining historical credence.

Charges of sexual assault and sexual sadism against Beria were first made in the speech by a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, [[Nikolay Shatalin]], at the Plenary Meeting of the committee on [[July 10]], [[1953]], two weeks after Beria's arrest. Shatalin said that Beria had had sexual relations with numerous women and that he had contracted [[syphilis]] as a result of his sex with prostitutes. Shatalin referred to a list (supposedly kept by Beria's bodyguard) of over 25 women with whom Beria had sex. Over time, however, the charges became more dramatic. Khrushchev in his posthumously published memoirs wrote: "We were given a list of more than 100 names of women. They were dragged to Beria by his people. And he had the same trick for them all: all who got to his house for the first time, Beria would invite for a dinner and would propose to drink for the health of Stalin. And in wine, he would mix in some sleeping pills..."

By the 1980s, the sexual assault stories about Beria included the rape of teenage girls. The author [[Anton Antonov-Ovseenko]], who wrote a biography of Beria, mentions in an interview a specific and clearly perverted sexual game Beria is said to have forced upon young girls before picking one of them to be raped. This alleged practice got the name "Beria's Flower Game".<ref name="dailytelegraph">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/12/23/wruss23.xml|title=Stalin's depraved executioner still has grip on Moscow|work=London Daily Telegraph|accessdate=December 19|accessyear=2006}}</ref>
 
Numerous stories have circulated over the years involving Beria personally beating, torturing and killing his victims. Since the 1970s, Muscovites have been retelling stories of bones found in either the back yard, cellars, or hidden inside the walls of Beria's former residence, currently the Tunisian Embassy. Such stories continue to re-appear in the news media. The London ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' reported in December [[2003]]: "The latest grisly find—a large thigh bone and some smaller leg bones—was only two years ago when a kitchen was re-tiled. In the basement, Anil, an Indian who has worked at the embassy for 17 years, showed a plastic bag of human bones he had found in the cellars."<ref name=dailytelegraph/> Such reports are denied by the people close to Beria, such as his son [[Sergo Beria]] and former Soviet foreign intelligence chief [[Pavel Sudoplatov]].
