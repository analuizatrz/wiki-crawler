The '''[[Game development|development]] of ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' ''' began in 2002, immediately after ''Morrowind''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s publication. ''Oblivion'' focused on providing a tighter storyline; improved [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI; improved physics, courtesy of the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics engine; and impressive [[Computer graphics|graphics]]. The game was released, following much [[Video game journalism|press]] coverage, on the [[PC]] and [[Xbox 360]] in early [[2006]], and the [[PS3]] in early [[2007]]. A plan to distribute content through [[micropayment]] from Bethesda's website and [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] was initially met with criticism due to its high price and low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, and with more content—proved popular. Bethesda released two expansion packs for ''Oblivion'' in late 2006 and early 2007: ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Knights of the Nine]]'', which included all previously-released micro-content releases, and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles]]''.

==Early development==
===Rumors and official announcements===
The first rumors of another ''Elder Scrolls'' release after ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' began to circulate in [[June 2004]], following Bethesda's posting of an e-mail searching for new staff. The new staff were to participate on a team that would "[push] the bleeding-edge of RPG development for the PC and [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|future-generation consoles]]". For those considering the job, the e-mail suggested that "knowledge of...The Elder Scrolls [is] a plus". At the time, a member of Bethesda's staff played down the importance of the last comment, stating that Bethesda was not going to say "what product these listings are for", and that "Obviously, we like candidates who understand RPGs and are familiar with the games we've made in the past."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/news/news_0403.htm |title=New Job Openings |work=News 2004-2003 |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |date=[[2004-06-16]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news_6100799.html |title=Development of next-gen Elder Scrolls under way? |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET|CNET Networks Entertainment]] |date=[[2004-06-16]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Suspicions of a new ''Elder Scrolls'' release were confirmed on [[September 10]], when Bethesda officially announced the identity of the game in question: ''The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion'', followed with a feature in the [[October 2004]] issue of ''[[Game Informer]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/news/news_0403.htm |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion announced  |work=News 2004-2003 |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |date=[[2004-09-10]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref><ref name="EIVPCNG">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6107156 |title=Elder Scrolls IV coming to PC, next-gen |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET|CNET Networks Entertainment]] |date=[[2004-09-10]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref>

===Staff===
As of the announcement, Bethesda had been working on ''Oblivion'' for 2 years, since [[2002]],<ref name="EIVPCNG"/> just as Bethesda was finishing up with ''Morrowind''.<ref name="E3IMP">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6124431 |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion E3 2005 Impressions |first=Andrew |last=Park |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET|CNET Networks Entertainment]] |date=[[2005-05-18]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> "No rest for the weary here!" said [[game producer]] Gavin Carter of the timing.<ref name="GBAN">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/interviews/oblivion1.php |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Interview |publisher=[[UGO]] |work=GameBanshee |date=[[2004-12-09]] |accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> In the same timeframe, Bethesda's ''Elder Scrolls'' team was split in two: half, mostly [[Game designer|designer]]s and [[Game artist|artist]]s, were sent to work on ''Morrowind''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind#Expansions|expansions]]; and the rest, mostly [[Game programmer|programmer]]s, were sent to work on technology for ''Oblivion''.<ref name="RPGNG">{{cite web|url=http://elderscrolls.com/codex/team_rpgnextgen.htm |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |title=The RPG for the Next Generation |first=Todd |last=Howard |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> 

===Design goals===
[[Image:Ssmartinwallpaperiw8.png|[[Martin Septim]], the "chosen one" of ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s main quest, was not the player character, but a non-player character.|thumb|right]]
The team's goal then was, in the words of [[executive producer]] [[Todd Howard]], to "create the quintessential RPG of the next generation", with a focus on a "combination of freeform gameplay and cutting-edge graphics."<ref name="GSPTQA">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?page=1&sid=6111720 |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Q&A - Overview, Character Development, Fallout |author=Staff |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET|CNET Networks Entertainment]] |date=[[2004-10-28]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> It was a wise decision to make at the time. Producing for next generation machines, rather than a cheap upgrade, gave Bethesda an additional four years of development: four years that "all but guaranteed" a punctual launch alongside the Xbox 360, four years that offered room for Bethesda to start from scratch.<ref name="DIR">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/83/11 |title=Bethesda: The Right Direction |publisher=[[The Escapist]] |first=Joe |last=Blancato |date=[[2007-02-06]] |accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> Howard describes this as an aspect of Bethesda's greater goal of "Reinvention", where the team's goal is to make "a new game that stands on its own, that has its own identity".<ref name="RPGNG"/> "You can't repeat yourself. I think it's a common trap when working on a sequel to just add some new features and content, and keep doing that. I think that's a good way to drive your games into the ground. You start drifting from what made the game special in the first place. So with The Elder Scrolls, I'm careful to not repeat what we've done before, and to really focus on trying to recapture again what made the games exciting in the first place."<ref name="DIR"/>

Keeping with the spirit of past games, Howard promised to keep with the spirit of "big-world, do-anything"-style games, feeling that a certain size and number of choices were needed to make role-playing feel "meaningful";<ref name="GSPTQA"/> but now there was to be greater emphasis on keeping the game focused.<ref name="RPGNG"/> [[Vice president|Vice President]] of [[Public relations|PR]] and [[Marketing]] for Bethesda Pete Hines saw the developments between games as less an issue of design focus and more as a "natural side effect of improving and refining how the game works". "It's not just a 'Hey, let's make this game accessible for people who have never played games before,' but if you do things that are smart and you make smart decisions, then by default it makes it easier for those people to pick up and play."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/extras/2006/022406_oblivion_1.x |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Preview |first=Chris |last=Remo |publisher=[[Shacknews]] |date=[[2006-02-24]] |accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> ''Oblivion'' would include fewer NPCs and quests than ''Morrowind'', and mindless filler, which Howard felt the team had been guilty of in the past, would be avoided.<ref name="RPGNG"/> In exchange, Producer Gavin Carter later explained, there would be greater focus on length and depth in the quests, quests which are "all so much more complex, more rich", quests "with more alternate paths, more chararcters [sic] to connect with, who actually have personalities". Carter cast negative aspersions on aspects of gameplay too far removed from the game's central plot. "I think we don't really need that stuff. I don't think and I'm not sure we really need that stuff. We really want the focus to be on the plot, fighting these demon lords, I think all that other stuff is tertiary and takes away."<ref name="GCRT">{{cite web|url=http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=5 |title=E3 2005 Coverage: Gavin Carter |author=Stargleman |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |date=[[2005-05-29]] |accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> 

The role of the player character in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of "[[The One#See also|chosen one]]", ''Oblivion'' would have the player character "find him, protect him, and help him."<ref name="GCLOUD"/><ref name="MYGAME"/> Aside from that, in the opinion of Hines, "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel "epic", simply because of the way the gamespace is designed: with openness in mind.<ref name="MYGAME">{{cite web|url=http://www.mygamer.com/index.php?page=interviews&mode=viewinterviews&id=35 |title=The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion - An interview with Pete Hines |first=Matt |last=Cook |publisher=Mygamer |date=[[2005-10-20]] |accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. "It's about getting out of the way when the player wants to walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants, but when they say, 'OK, I'm ready to do the next part of the main quest, where do I go?', we have to be ready with an answer so there's no confusion, no downtime."<ref name="GCLOUD">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051103190838/http://www.gamecloud.com/article.php?article_id=1635 |url=http://www.gamecloud.com/article.php?article_id=1635 |title=Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Interview |date=[[2005-09-26]] |archivedate=2005-11-03 |publisher=Gamecloud |accessdate=2007-06-02 |first=John |last=Callaham}}</ref>

===Technology===
[[Image:ElderScrollsOblivionScreenshot11.jpg|right|thumb|In-game screenshot showing ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Graphical user interface|user interface]], HDR lighting and long drawing distance.]]
As they had done with previous games in the series, Bethesda threw out their old content and technology and began work anew. A new engine was envisioned, one which would take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines, like [[high dynamic range rendering]] and [[Specularity|specular mapping]].<ref name="E3IMP"/> The final product was shipped with an engine formed of a mixture of in-house tech and Numerical Design Limited's [[Gamebryo]] engine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elitebastards.com/page.php?pageid=12316 |title=Oblivion interview - Gavin Carter of Bethesda |publisher=Elite Bastards |date=[[2005-10-20]] |accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> "tricked out" in collaboration with Bethesda's graphics programmers and NDL.<ref name="TVG">{{cite web|title=Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - Q&A |url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/articles/Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_-_QA_Feature_8066_4139_0_0_0_0_20.htm |first=Derek |last=dela Fuente |accessdate=2007-06-02 |publisher=TVG |date=[[2005-07-20]]}}</ref> Cheng has described the game as "[[pixel shader|pixel-shader]] heavy", taking advantage of the feature in rendering "metal, wood, stone, blood, skin," in addition to water, which was the only use ''Morrowind'' made of the technology.

===Publishing agreements===
On [[February 3]] [[2005]], Bethesda entered into an agreement with [[Take-Two Interactive]] regarding the publication and release of ''Oblivion''. Under the agreement, Bethesda would retain full control over ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s development and the rights to any possible sequels, and Take-Two would agree to publish the game under its recently-formed [[2K Games]] sub brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/news/press_020305.htm |title=Bethesda Softworks® Signs Co-Publishing Agreement with Take-Two Interactive for The Elder Scrolls® IV: Oblivion™ |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |date=[[2005-02-03]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6117825 |title=Take-Two to copublish Elder Scrolls IV, Cthulhu |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET|CNET Networks Entertainment]] |date=[[2005-02-03]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> According to Carter, the team's experience was a rarity in the industry; few independent developer-publisher relationships still exist, and it was a surprise that Bethesda's experience worked out as well as it did. "It's something so rare in the industry that most people think I'm lying when I say it, but it's true." Carter described Take-Two's role as one of minimal interference, and the company mostly left Bethesda's development teams alone, trusting them to produce a "fantastic product" with minimal bureaucratic interference or "red tape".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameproducer.net/2006/05/25/interview-oblivion-game-producer-gavin-carter/ |title=Interview: Oblivion Game Producer Gavin Carter |publisher=Game Producer.net |date=[[2006-05-25]] |accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> Howard said much the same thing in regards to the legal proceedings affecting Bethesda's parent ZeniMax during the initial stages of game development:<ref>{{cite court|url=http://www.courts.state.md.us/opinions/cosa/2007/2368s05.pdf |litigants=Christopher S.

"I just focus on the games."<ref name="DIR"/> Ashley Cheng, ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s senior producer, concurred. "We have complete freedom to make whatever kind of game we want here." While the team does "pay attention to market trends", ultimately "we decide where we want to go, not market data."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warcry.com/scripts/columns/view_sectionalt.phtml?site=15&id=102&colid=6611 |title=Q&A With Ashley Cheng of Bethesda |date=[[2005-03-02]] |author=Malygris |publisher=WarCry Network |accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref>

[[Image:Dsc00708.JPG|The Los Angeles Convention Center, where E3 was held.|right|thumb]]
On [[May 16]] [[2005]], Bethesda announced that they would be releasing ''Oblivion'' on [[Microsoft]]'s Xbox 360, and that the game's public debut would come at the [[E3|Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in [[Los Angeles]] on [[May 18]] [[2005]], with a slated release date of winter 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/news/press_051705.htm |title=Bethesda Softworks and 2K Games announce The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion for Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |date=[[2005-05-16]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> The version shown at E3 was a substantially finished game. Most content was already in the game, leaving aside only the polish that the final months of development would bring. The game's world, for example, had already been fully constructed, and only needed to undergo its "clutter pass", wherein minor game items—"books, weapons, and thousands of forks and plates"—are dropped into the game world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6124431 |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Q&A - Oblivion at E3 2005 |author=Staff |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET|CNET Networks Entertainment]] |date=[[2005-05-17]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> 

Howard himself never took to the show. "It's like a beauty pageant," he told one reporter.

==Downloadable content==
===Background and Horse Armor===
[[Image:Oblivion—Horse Armor.jpg|The content of the "Horse Armor" package was generally seen as meagre.|thumb|right]]
From [[April 2006]] onwards, Bethesda began releasing small, downloadable packages of content from their website and over the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], for prices equivalent to between one and three [[United States dollar|US dollar]]s.<ref name="downloads">{{cite web|url=http://www.obliviondownloads.com/StoreCatalog_ProductList.aspx?SubCategoryId=1 |title=Oblivion Downloads |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |accessdate=2006-12-20}}</ref> The first package, a set of horse armour for ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s steeds, was released on [[April 3]] [[2006]], costing 200 [[Microsoft Points|Marketplace points]], equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]]2.50<ref name="HRSRMR">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?page=1&sid=6147013 |title=Oblivion horse armor now available |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-04-03]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> or [[Pound sterling|GBP]]1.50;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=15909 |title=Bethesda announces new premium Oblivion content |first=Paul |last=Loughrey |publisher=[[Eurogamer#GamesIndustry.biz|GamesIndustry.biz]] |date=[[2006-04-05]] |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> the corresponding PC release cost was [[United States dollar|US$]]1.99.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6147320 |title=Next Oblivion add-on priced |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-04-07]] |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Bethesda offered no rationale for the price discrepancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3149261&a=all |title=Oblivion 360 Downloads Begin |publisher=[[1UP]] |date=[[2006-04-03]] |first=Patrick |last=Klepek |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> These were not the first ''Oblivion''-related Marketplace releases, (that honor goes to a series of dashboard themes and picture packs released prior to ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s publication, in [[February 2006]], for a nominal fee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6144822 |title=Oblivion content now on Marketplace |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-02-23]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>) nor were they entirely unexpected: Bethesda had previously announced their desire to support the Xbox release with downloadable Marketplace content,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8784 |title=Round Up: Oblivion Downloadable Content, ESRB Ratings Issues, Ubisoft COO Resigns |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=[[2006-04-03]] |first=Jason |last=Dobson |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> and other publishers had already began to release similar packages for their games, at similar prices. A [[November 2005]]-release of a "Winter Warrior Pack" for ''[[Kameo: Elements of Power]]'' was also priced at 200 Marketplace points,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140529.html |title=Kameo konkokts kool kostumes |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-11-29]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> and similar content additions had been scheduled for ''[[Project Gotham Racing 3]]'' and ''[[Perfect Dark Zero]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/perfectdarkzero/news.html?page=1&sid=6146324 |title=Marketplace hits 10 million transactions |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-03-21]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Indeed, Marketplace content additions formed a significant part of a [[March 2006]] Microsoft announcement regarding the future of [[Xbox Live]]. "Downloadable in-game content is a main focus of Microsoft's strategy heading into the next-gen console war," stated one [[GameSpot]] reporter.<ref name="HRSRMR"/> "With more consoles on their way to retail, 80 games available by June, and new content and experiences coming to Xbox Live all the time, there has never been a better time to own an Xbox 360," announced [[Peter Moore (Microsoft)|Peter Moore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8606 |title=Microsoft Confirms Xbox 360 Production Surge, Plans |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=[[2006-03-21]] |first=Simon |last=Carless |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Nonetheless, although [[Xbox Live Arcade]] games, picture packs, [[Xbox 360#Dashboard|dashboard]]s and profile themes continued to be a Marketplace success for Microsoft, the aforementioned in-game content remained sparse.<ref name="HRSRMR"/>

===Consumer backlash===
Although gamers generally displayed some enthusiasm for the concept of [[micropayment]]s for downloadable in-game content,<ref name="BRTOI">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3149299 |title=Bethesda Responds To Oblivion Issues |publisher=[[1UP]] |date=[[2006-04-04]] |first=Patrick |last=Klepek |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref><ref name="HRSRMR"/> ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s horse armor release caused significant discord on the [[Internet forum|forums of the Internet]], with gamers divided by the item's value versus its cost. "This is not a matter of it being expensive in the grand scheme of things. This is not a matter of it being a requirement to buy. It's a matter of basically spitting in the consumer's collective face," wrote one poster. "Something like horse armor is a trivial addition to the game...Bethesda should be ashamed of it." Others were more conciliatory. "I agree that small stuff like that SHOULD be free, but in this day and age it's unlikely that we'll get a lot of 'free' content. If you are into the game as much as I am, you're going to shell out the $ for downloads. Microsoft knows this...so the best we can hope for is that it will be free (unlikely) or inexpensive (as is the case here)," wrote another.<ref name="HRSRMR"/> A [[Joystiq]] editorial gave further complaints. "C'mon, if this download came with a side quest, then sure, we'd throw down some points. But, despite our ever-growing addiction to ''Oblivion'', we're not itching to hand over additional cash for an item that was supposed to be included in the game's initial release."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/03/download-oblivions-horse-armor-for-a-price/ |title=Download Oblivion's horse armor, for a price |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-04-03]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> ''Kameo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release hadn't provoked such a backlash; but then, there hadn't been such "feverish enthusiasm" for ''Kameo'' as there was for ''Oblivion''.<ref name="BRTOI"/>

On [[April 4]], the day after the first content release, Bethesda representatives, and Pete Hines in particular, made a variety of similar responses to various inquiries regarding the mod; broadly similar responses were issued to GameSpot News, to Evil Avatar, and to 1UP. Regarding the cost of the add-on, Hines stated that Bethesda aimed for a price point that "fit". "A Theme costs 150 points. The ''Kameo'' thing was 200. We're trying to find the right spot that fits... "<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/04/bethesda-responds-to-oblivion-backlash/ |title=Bethesda responds to Oblivion backlash |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-04-04]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Hines assured the press  that Bethesda wasn't going to respond rashly to customer criticism. "We're not going to make any knee-jerk decisions based on it [the armor] being available for five hours. We'll see what folks think and put out a few others we have planned and figure out where to go from there." Responding to concerns as to why ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s downloadable content would cost money, while ''Morrowind''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s had been free, Hines simply stated: "Different game, different approach to downloadable content and the size and scope of things we want to do, and what it takes to do them."<ref name="BRTOI"/> A Bethesda representative told GameSpot that future plans were still somewhat uncertain. "It's hard to tell right now until we have more stuff out, how many people want item plug-ins, versus quests or locations, and so forth. It certainly may be the case that some plug-ins will appeal to some folks and not others, but we hope we'll be able to provide a good variety so that there's something for everyone...and hopefully more than one something for everyone."<ref name="MOCC">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6147118 |title=More Oblivion content coming, detailed |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-04-04]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>

===Later releases===
April 4 also saw the announcement of two new downloadable content packs for the coming weeks: an "Orrery" quest that would see gamers setting out to repair a Dwarven Orrery; and a "Wizard's Tower" that would offer a new home for player characters, complete with the capacity to grow herbs, summon atronachs, and make spells.<ref name="MOCC"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/05/next-oblivion-downloads-promise-more-than-horse-getups/ |title=Next Oblivion downloads promise more than horse getups |date=[[2006-04-05]] |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> 1UP predicted that, given Bethesda's response to customer criticism, those releases would be somewhat more substantial than the "Horse Armor" release was.<ref name="BRTOI"/> On [[April 7]], Bethesda priced the "Orrery". Offering what GameSpot called "more bang for less buck", Bethesda set the PC release price at [[United States dollar|US$]]1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]]1.88.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6147320 |title=Next Oblivion add-on priced |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-04-07]] |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Joystiq offered their support—"'Big ups'"—to the company for the new price. "Although we passed on the $2.50 horse armor this week, we'll definitely be messin' with that Orrery device when it hits the Marketplace."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/07/bethesda-patching-oblivion-lowers-cost-of-future-content-downlo/ |title=Bethesda patching Oblivion, lowers cost of future content download |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-04-07]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> The pack was eventually released on [[April 17]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/17/oblivion-orrey-pack-now-available-on-xbox-live/ |title=Oblivion Orrery pack now available on Xbox Live [Update] |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-04-17]] |first=Ross |last=Miller |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Also on April 7, [[EB Games]] and [[GameStop]] began offering a coupon promising one free download of the "Horse Armor" pack with every purchase of the PC edition of ''Oblivion''; Xbox 360 owners were once again out of luck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/07/free-oblivion-horse-armor-coupon-with-pc-version/ |title=Free Oblivion horse armor coupon |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |first=Christopher |last=Grant |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> The "Wizard's Tower", called the "Frostcrag Spire" in-game, was released on [[April 24]] for the same price as the "Orrery".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6148244 |title=Wizard's Tower add-on available for Oblivion |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-04-24]] |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

New releases continued into late 2006. The "Thieves' Den", a 2.27MB download offering the chance to "Uncover a famous pirate's lost ship and claim it for your own", was released on [[May 22]] for the Xbox 360, priced at 150 Marketplace points, "roughly" equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]] $1.89.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6151636.html |title=Den of Xbox 360 Oblivion thieves uncovered |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-05-22]] |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated "Basically, it's [[The Goonies|Goonies]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/05/17/new-oblivion-add-on-inspired-by-goonies/ |title=New Oblivion add-on inspired by Goonies |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-05-17]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> "Mehrunes' Razor", a quest revolving around a mage in search of the deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes' Razor, was released on [[June 14]].

With all the add-ons included, he calculated, "That's over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far." Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming [[PS3]] release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: "will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted?...Microtransactions are sticky business."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3151156 |title=Yes, Even More Oblivion Content Coming |publisher=[[1UP]] |date=[[2006-06-01]] |first=Luke |last=Smith |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Joystiq continued to harp on the "Horse Armor" add-on in their notice of the quest's release.

Like the "Orrery" and the "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set "The Vile Lair"'s PC release price at [[United States dollar|US$]]1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]]1.88.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6163580 |title=Oblivion getting $2 evil add-on July 13 |date=[[2006-07-11]] |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Joystiq responded positively to the new price point.
