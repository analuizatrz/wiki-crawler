'''Behaalotecha''', '''Beha’alotecha''', '''Beha’alothekha''', or '''Behaaloscha''' (בהעלותך — [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "when you set up,” the 11th word, and the first distinctive word, in the parshah) is the 36th [[weekly Torah portion]] (''parshah'') in the annual [[Judaism|Jewish]] cycle of [[Torah reading]] and the third in the book of [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]].  It constitutes {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:1–12:16.|HE}}  [[Jew]]s generally read it in late May or in June.

The parshah tells of the lampstand in the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]], the consecration of the [[Levite]]s, the [[Pesach Sheni|Second Passover]], how a cloud and fire led the [[Israelite]]s, the silver [[trumpet]]s, how the Israelites set out on their journeys, complaining by the Israelites, and how [[Miriam]] and [[Aaron]] questioned [[Moses]].

== Summary ==
===The lampstand===
[[Names of God in Judaism|God]] told Moses to tell Aaron to mount the seven lamps so as to give light to the front of the lampstand in the Tabernacle, and Aaron did so.  ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:1–3.|HE}})
===Consecration of the Levites===
God told Moses to cleanse the Levites by sprinkling on them [[water]] of purification, and making them [[Shaving|shave]] their whole bodies and wash their [[Clothing|clothes]]. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:5–7.|HE}})  Moses was to assemble the Israelites around the Levites and cause the Israelites to [[Semicha in sacrifices|lay their hands]] upon the Levites. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:9–10.|HE}})  Aaron was to designate the Levites as an elevation [[korban|offering]] from the Israelites. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:11.|HE}})  The Levites were then to lay their hands in turn upon the heads of two [[Cattle|bulls]], one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to make expiation for the Levites. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:12.|HE}})  Thereafter, the Levites were qualified for the service of the Tent of Meeting, in place of the firstborn of the Israelites. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:15–16.|HE}})  God told Moses that Levites aged 25 to 50 were to work in the service of the Tent of Meeting, but after age 50 they were to retire and could stand guard but not perform labor. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:23–26.|HE}})  
===Second Passover===
At the beginning of the second year following [[the Exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], God told Moses to have the Israelites celebrate [[Passover]] at its set time. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|9:1–3.|HE}})  But some men were unclean because they had had contact with a corpse and could not offer the Passover sacrifice on the set day. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|9:6.|HE}})  They asked Moses and Aaron how they could participate in Passover, and Moses told them to stand by while he listened for God’s instructions. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|9:7–8.|HE}})  God told Moses that whenever Israelites were defiled by a corpse or on a long journey on Passover, they were to offer the Passover offering on the 14th day of the second month — a month after Passover — otherwise in strict accord with the law of the Passover sacrifice. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|9:9–12.|HE}})  But if a man who was clean and not on a journey refrained from offering the Passover sacrifice, he was to be cut off from his kin. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|9:13.|HE}})
[[Image:Fire02.jpg|250px|left]]
===Cloud and fire===
Starting the day that the Tabernacle was set up, a [[cloud]] covered the Tabernacle by day, and a [[fire]] rested on it by night. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|9:15–16.|HE}})  Whenever the cloud lifted from the Tent, the Israelites would follow it until the cloud settled, and there the Israelites would make camp and stay as long as the cloud lingered. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|9:17–23.|HE}})  
[[Image:Persepolis Trumpet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|trumpet from the 6th–4th Century B.C.E. ([[Persepolis]] museum)]]
===Silver trumpets===
God told Moses to have two silver trumpets made to summon the community and to set it in motion. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:1–2.|HE}})  Upon long blasts of the two horns, the whole community was to assemble before the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:3.|HE}})  Upon the blast of one, the chieftains were to assemble.  ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:4.|HE}})  Short blasts directed the divisions encamped on the east to move forward, and a second set of short blasts directed those on the south to move forward. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:5–6.|HE}})  As well, short blasts were to be sounded when the Israelites were at [[war]] against an aggressor who attacked them, and the trumpets were to be sounded on joyous occasions, festivals, new moons, burnt offerings, and sacrifices of well-being. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:9–10.|HE}})  
===Journeys===
In the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle and the Israelites set out on their journeys from the [[wilderness]] of [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Sinai]] to the wilderness of [[Desert of Paran|Paran]]. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:11–12.|HE}})  Moses asked his father-in-law (here called [[Jethro|Hobab son of Reuel]] the [[Midian|Midianite]]) to come with the Israelites, promising to be generous with him, but he replied that he would return to his native land. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:29–30.|HE}})  Moses pressed him again, noting that he could serve as the Israelites’ guide. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:31–32.|HE}}) 

They marched three days distance from [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], with the [[Ark of the Covenant]] in front of them, and God’s cloud above them by day. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:33–34.|HE}})  When the Ark was to set out, Moses would say: “Advance, O Lord! May Your enemies be scattered, and may Your foes flee before You!” ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:35.|HE}})  And when it halted, he would say: “Return, O Lord, You who are Israel’s myriads of thousands!” ({{Bibleverse||Num.|10:36.|HE}})
===Complaining===
The people took to complaining bitterly before God, and God ravaging the outskirts of the camp with fire until Moses prayed to God, and then the fire died down. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:1–2.|HE}})
[[Image:Quail32.jpg|175px|left|thumb|quail]]
The riffraff in their midst (Hebrew “''asafsuf''” — compare the “mixed multitude,” Hebrew “''erev rav''” of {{Bibleverse||Ex.|12:38|HE}}) felt a gluttonous craving and the Israelites complained, “If only we had [[meat]] to eat! ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:4.|HE}})  Moses in turn complained to God, “Why have You . . . laid the burden of all this people upon me? ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:11.|HE}})  God told Moses to gather 70 elders, so that God could come down and put some of the spirit that rested on Moses upon them, so that they might share the burden of the people. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:16–17.|HE}}) And God told Moses to tell the people to purify themselves, for the next day they would eat meat.  ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:18.|HE}})  But Moses questioned how enough flocks, herds, or fish could be found to feed 600,000. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:21–22.|HE}})  God answered: “Is there a limit to the Lord’s power?” ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:23.|HE}})

Moses gathered the 70 elders, and God came down in a cloud, spoke to Moses, and drew upon the spirit that was on Moses and put it upon the elders. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:24–25.|HE}})  When the spirit rested upon them, they spoke in ecstasy, but did not continue. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:25.|HE}})  [[Eldad and Medad]] had remained in camp, yet the spirit rested upon them, and they spoke in ecstasy in the camp. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:26.|HE}})  When a youth reported to Moses that Eldad and Medad were acting the [[prophet]] in the camp, [[Joshua]] called on Moses to restrain them. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:27–28.|HE}})  But Moses told Joshua: “Would that all the Lord’s people were prophets, that the Lord put His spirit upon them!” ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:29.|HE}})  

A [[wind]] from God then swept [[quail]] from the [[sea]] and strewed them all around the camp, and the people gathered quail for two days. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:31–32.|HE}})   While the meat was still between their teeth, God struck the people with a plague. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|11:33.|HE}})  
===Miriam and Aaron question Moses===
Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, saying: “He married a [[Biblical Cush|Cushite]] woman!” and “Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?  Has He not spoken through us as well?” ({{Bibleverse||Num.|12:1–2.|HE}})  God heard and called Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to come to the Tent of Meeting. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|12:2–4.|HE}})  God came down in cloud and called out to Aaron and Miriam: “When a prophet of the Lord arises among you, I make Myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a [[dream]].  Not so with My servant Moses; he is trusted throughout My household.  With him I speak [[mouth]] to mouth, plainly and not in riddles, and he beholds the likeness of the Lord.  How then did you not shrink from speaking against My servant Moses!”  ({{Bibleverse||Num.|12:5–8.|HE}})  As the cloud withdrew, Miriam was stricken with snow-white scales. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|12:10.|HE}})  Moses cried out to God, “O God, pray heal her!” ({{Bibleverse||Num.|12:13.|HE}})  But God said to Moses, “If her father spat in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days?  Let her be shut out of camp for seven days.” ({{Bibleverse||Num.|12:14.|HE}}) And the people waited until she rejoined the camp. ({{Bibleverse||Num.|12:15.|HE}})
==In classical rabbinic interpretation==
[[Image:Menorah7a.png|350px|thumb|right|the menorah]]
===Numbers chapter 8===
A [[Baraita]] interpreted the expression “beaten work of gold” in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:4|HE}} to require that if the craftsmen made the menorah out of gold, then they had to beat it out of one single piece of gold.  The [[Gemara]] then reasoned that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:4|HE}} used the expression “beaten work” a second time to differentiate the requirements for crafting the menorah from the requirements for crafting the trumpets in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|10:2,|HE}} which used the expression “beaten work” only once.  The Gemara concluded that the verse required the craftsmen to beat the menorah from a single piece of metal, but not so the trumpets. (Babylonian Talmud Menachot 28a.)

A [[midrash]] deduced from {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:4|HE}} that the work of the candlestick was one of four things that God had to show Moses with God’s finger because Moses was puzzled by them. ([[Exodus Rabbah]] 15:28.)

The [[Mishnah]] interpreted {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:7|HE}} to command the Levites to cut off all their hair with a razor, and not leave so much as two hairs remaining. (Mishnah Negaim 14:4.)

Rabbi [[Jose the Galilean]] cited the use of “second” in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:8|HE}} to rule that bulls brought for sacrifices had to be no more than two years old.  But the Sages ruled that bulls could be as many as three years old, and [[Rabbi Meir]] ruled that even those that are four or five years old were valid, but old animals were not brought out of respect. (Mishnah Parah 1:2.)

A midrash interpreted God’s words “the Levites shall be Mine” in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:14|HE}} to indicate a relationship that will never cease, either in this world or in the World to Come. ([[Leviticus Rabbah]] 2:2.)

The Mishnah deduced from {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:16|HE}} that before Moses set up the Tabernacle, the firstborn performed sacrifices, but after Moses set up the Tabernacle, priests performed the sacrifices. (Mishnah Zevachim 14:4; Babylonian Talmud Zevachim 112b.)

Rabbi Judan considered God’s five mentions of “Israel” in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:19|HE}} to demonstrate how much God loves Israel. (Leviticus Rabbah 2:4.)

A midrash noted that {{Bibleverse||Numbers|8:24|HE}} says, “from 25 years old and upward they shall go in to perform the service in the work of the tent of meeting,” while {{Bibleverse||Numbers|4:3,|HE}} [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#23 23,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#30 30,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#35 35,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#39 39,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#43 43,] and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#47 47] say that Levites “30 years old and upward” did service in the tent of meeting.  The midrash deduced that the difference teaches that all those five years, from the age of 25 to the age of 30, Levites served apprenticeships, and from that time onward they were allowed to draw near to do service.  The midrash concluded that a Levite could not enter the Temple courtyard to do service unless he had served an apprenticeship of five years.  And the midrash inferred from this that students who see no sign of success in their studies within a period of five years will never see any.  Rabbi Jose said that students had to see success within three years, basing his position on the words “that they should be nourished three years” in {{Bibleverse||Daniel|1:5.|HE}} (Numbers Rabbah 6:3.)
===Numbers chapter 9===
The Gemara noted that the events beginning in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1,|HE}} set “in the ''first'' month of the second year,” occurred before the events at the beginning of the book of Numbers, which {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} reports began in “the ''second'' month, in the second year.”  Rav Menasia bar Tahlifa said in [[Abba Arika|Rab's]] name that this proved that there is no chronological order in the Torah. (Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 6b.)

[[Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak|Rav Nahman bar Isaac]] noted that both {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} and {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1|HE}} begin, “And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,” and deduced that just as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|1:1|HE}} happened (in the words of that verse) “on the first day of the second month,” so too {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1|HE}} happened at the beginning of the month.  And as {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1|HE}} addressed the [[Passover]] offering, which the Israelites were to bring on the 14th of the month, the Gemara concluded  that one should expound the laws of a holiday two weeks before the holiday. (Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 6b.)

Chapter 9 of Tractate [[Pesachim]] in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud and chapter 8 of Tractate Pisha (Pesachim) in the [[Tosefta]] interpreted the laws of the second Passover in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1–14.|HE}} (Mishnah Pesachim 9:1–4; Tosefta Pisha (Pesachim) 8:1–10; Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 92b–96b.)  And tractate Pesachim in the Mishnah, [[Tosefta]], [[Jerusalem Talmud]], and Babylonian Talmud interpreted the laws of the Passover generally in [[Exodus]] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0212.htm#3 12:3–27,] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0212.htm#43 43–49;] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0213.htm#6 13:6–10;] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0234.htm#25 34:25;] [[Leviticus]] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0323.htm#4 23:4–8;] {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:1–14;|HE}} [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0428.htm#16 28:16-25;] and [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0516.htm 16:1–8.] (Mishnah [[s:Mishnah/Seder Moed/Tractate Pesachim|Pesachim 1:1–10:9]]; Tosefta Pisha 1:1–10:13; Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 1a–; Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 2a–121b.)

The Gemara asked who were the “certain men” who {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:6|HE}} reported “were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover.”  Rabbi Jose the Galilean said that they were the ones who bore the coffin of Joseph (carrying out Joseph’s request of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|50:24–25|HE}}).  [[Akiba ben Joseph|Rabbi Akiba]] said that they were [[List of minor Biblical figures|Mishael and Elzaphan]] who were occupied with the remains of [[Nadav and Avihu|Nadab and Abihu]] (as reported in {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|10:1–5|HE}}).  Rabbi Isaac argued, however, that if they were those who bore the coffin of Joseph or if they were Mishael and Elzaphan, they would have had time to cleanse themselves before Passover.  Rather, Rabbi Isaac identified the men as some who were occupied with the obligation to burry an abandoned corpse (''met mitzvah''). (Babylonian Talmud Sukkah 25b.)

The Mishnah counted the sin of failing to observe the Passover enumerated in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|9:13|HE}} as one of 36 sins punishable by the penalty of being cut off from the Israelite people. (Mishnah Keritot 1:1; Babylonian Talmud Keritot 2a.)

===Numbers chapter 11===
Rab and [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]] debated how to interpret the report of {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:5|HE}} that the Israelites complained: “We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for free.”  One read “fish” literally, while the other read “fish” to mean the illicit intercourse that they were “free” to have when they were in Egypt, before the commandments of Sinai.  [[Rabbi Ammi]] and [[Rabbi Assi]] disputed the meaning of the report of {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:5|HE}} that the Israelites remembered the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic of Egypt.  One said that manna had the taste of every kind of food except these five; while the other said that manna had both the taste and the substance of all foods except these, for which manna had only the taste without the substance. (Babylonian Talmud Yoma 75a.)

The Gemara asked how one could reconcile {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:9,|HE}} which reported that manna fell “upon the camp,” with {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:8,|HE}} which reported that “people went about and gathered it,” implying that they had to leave the camp to get it.  The Gemara concluded that the manna fell at different places for different classes of people:  For the righteous, it fell in front of their homes; for average folk, it fell just outside the camp, and they went out and gathered; and for the wicked, it fell at some distance, and they had to go about to gather it.  

The Gemara asked how one could reconcile {{Bibleverse||Exodus|16:4,|HE}} which reported that manna fell as “bread from heaven”; with {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:8,|HE}} which reported that people “made cakes of it,” implying that it required baking; with {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:8,|HE}} which reported that people “ground it in mills,” implying that it required grinding.  The Gemara concluded that the manna fell in different forms for different classes of people:  For the righteous, it fell as bread; for average folk, it fell as cakes that required baking; and for the wicked, it fell as kernels that required grinding.  

[[Judah ben Ezekiel|Rab Judah]] said in the name of Rab (or others say Rabbi Hama ben Hanina) that the words “ground it in mortars” in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:8|HE}} taught that with the manna came down women’s cosmetics, which were also ground in mortars.  Rabbi Hama interpreted the words “seethed it in pots” in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:8|HE}} to teach that with the manna came down the ingredients or seasonings for a cooked dish.  Rabbi [[Abbahu]] interpreted the words “the taste of it was as the taste of a cake (''leshad'') baked with oil” in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:8|HE}} to teach that just as infants find many flavors in the milk of their mother’s breast (''shad''), so the Israelites found many tastes in the manna. (Babylonian Talmud Yoma 75a.)  The Gemara asked how one could reconcile {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:8,|HE}} which reported that “the taste of it was as the taste of a cake baked with oil,” with {{Bibleverse||Exodus|16:31,|HE}} which reported that “the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.”  Rabbi Jose ben Hanina said that the manna tasted differently for different classes of people: It tasted like honey for infants, bread for youths, and oil for the aged. (Babylonian Talmud Yoma 75b.)

The Mishnah deduced from {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:16|HE}} that the Great [[Sanhedrin]] consisted of 71 members, because God instructed Moses to gather 70 elders of Israel, and Moses at their head made 71.  [[Judah ben Ilai|Rabbi Judah]] said that it consisted only of 70. (Mishnah Sanhedrin 1:6; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 2a.)  

The Gemara asked how one could reconcile {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:20,|HE}} which reported God’s promise that the Israelites would eat meat “a whole month,” with {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:33,|HE}} which reported that “while the flesh was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, . . . the Lord smote the people.”  The Gemara concluded that God’s punishment came at different speeds for different classes of people:  Average people died immediately; while the wicked suffered over a month before they died. (Babylonian Talmud Yoma 75b.)

The Gemara explained how Moses selected the members of the Sanhedrin in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:24.|HE}} (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 17a.)
[[Image:Maryam and Moses painting.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Miriam waiting for the baby Moses in the Nile (illustration by [[Hippolyte Delaroche]])]]
[[Shimon bar Yochai|Rabbi Simeon]] expounded on the report in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:26|HE}} that Eldad and Medad remained in the camp.  When God ordered Moses in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:16|HE}} to gather 70 of the elders of Israel, Eldad and Medad protested that they were not worthy of that dignity.  In reward for their humility, God added yet more greatness to their greatness; so while the other elders’ prophesying ceased, Eldad’s and Medad’s prophesying continued.  Rabbi Simeon taught that Eldad and Medad prophesied that Moses would die and Joshua would bring Israel into the [[Land of Israel]].  Abba Hanin taught in the name of [[Eliezer ben Hurcanus|Rabbi Eliezer]] that Eldad and Medad prophesied concerning the matter of the quails in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11,|HE}} calling on the quail to arise.  [[Rav Nachman|Rav Nahman]] read {{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|38:17|HE}} to teach that they prophesied concerning [[Gog and Magog]].  The Gemara found support for Rabbi Simeon’s assertion that while the other elders’ prophesying ceased, Eldad’s and Medad’s prophesying continued in the use by {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:25|HE}} of the past tense, “and they prophesied,” to describe the other elders, whereas {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:27|HE}} uses the present tense with regard to Eldad and Medad.  The Gemara taught that if Eldad and Medad prophesied that Moses would die, then that explains why Joshua in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:28|HE}} requested Moses to forbid them.  The Gemara reasoned that if Eldad and Medad prophesied about the quail or Gog and Magog, then Joshua asked Moses to forbid them because their behavior did not appear seemly, like a student who issues legal rulings in the presence of his teacher.  The Gemara further reasoned that according to those who said that Eldad and Medad prophesied about the quail or Gog and Magog, Moses’ response in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:28,|HE}} “Would that all the Lord's people were prophets,” made sense.  But if Eldad and Medad prophesied that Moses would die, the Gemara wondered why Moses expressed pleasure with that in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:28.|HE}}  The Gemara explained that Moses must not have heard their entire prophecy.  And the Gemara interpreted Joshua’s request in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:28|HE}} for Moses to “forbid them” to mean that Moses should give Eldad and Medad public burdens that would cause them to cease their prophesying. (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 17a.)
===Numbers chapter 12===
The Mishnah cited {{Bibleverse||Numbers|12:15|HE}} for the proposition that [[Divine_Providence#In_Jewish_thought|Providence]] treats a person measure for measure as that person treats others.  And so because, as {{Bibleverse||Exodus|2:4|HE}} relates, Miriam waited for the baby Moses in the [[Nile]], so the Israelites waited seven days for Miriam in the wilderness in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|12:15.|HE}} (Mishnah [[s:Mishnah/Seder Nashim/Tractate Sotah/Chapter 1/9|Sotah 1:7–9;]] Babylonian Talmud Sotah 9b.)

==Haftarah==
The [[haftarah]] for the parshah is [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2302.htm#14 2:14–4:7.]  Both the parshah and the haftarah discuss the lampstand (''menorah''). ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:1–4;|HE}} {{Bibleverse||Zech.|4:2–3|HE}}).  Text of Zechariah shortly after that of the haftarah explains that the lights of the lampstand symbolize God’s eyes, keeping watch on the earth. ({{Bibleverse||Zech.|4:10.|HE}})  And in the haftarah, God’s [[angel]] explains the message of [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah’s]] vision of the lampstand: “Not by might, nor by power, but by My spirit, says the Lord of hosts.” ({{Bibleverse||Zech.|4:6.|HE}})  Both the parshah and the haftarah also discuss the purification of priests and their clothes, the parshah in the purification of the Levites ({{Bibleverse||Num.|8:6–7|HE}}) and the haftarah in the purification of the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] [[Joshua the High Priest|Joshua]]. ({{Bibleverse||Zech.|3:3–5.|HE}})
==In the liturgy==
Jews chant the description of how the Israelites carried the Ark of the Covenant in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|10:35|HE}} during the Torah service when the Ark containing the Torah is opened.  And Jews chant the description of how the Israelites set the Ark of the Covenant down in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|10:36|HE}} during the Torah service when the Torah is returned to the Ark. (Reuven Hammer. ''Or Hadash: A Commentary on [[Siddur Sim Shalom]] for Shabbat and Festivals'', 139, 154. New York: The Rabbinical Assembly, 2003. ISBN 0916219208.)

The 16th Century [[Safed]] Rabbi Eliezer Azikri quoted the words of Moses’ prayer “Please God” (''El na'') in {{Bibleverse||Numbers|12:13|HE}} in his [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] poem ''Yedid Nefesh'' (“Soul’s Beloved”), which in turn many congregations chant just before the Kabbalat Shabbat [[Jewish services|prayer service]].
