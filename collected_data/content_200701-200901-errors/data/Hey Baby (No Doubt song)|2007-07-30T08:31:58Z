"'''Hey Baby'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song written by [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Tony Kanal]], [[Tom Dumont]], and [[Bounty Killer]] for [[No Doubt]]'s fifth studio album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001).  The song is heavily influenced by the [[Jamaica]]n [[dancehall]] music present at No Doubt's post-show parties and tour bus lounges of their ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' tour.<ref name="singles"/>  Its lyrics describe the debauchery with [[groupie]]s at these parties.

The song received mixed reviews from music critics.  It was released as the album's [[lead single]] in October 2001 (see [[2001 in music]]).  The single was commercially succesful and peaked at number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]].  At the [[45th Grammy Awards]], "Hey Baby" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].

==Background and writing==
The song began with instrumentals programmed with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].  The lyrics and melodies were recorded at a session at guitarist [[Tom Dumont]]'s home studio in [[Los Angeles]] weeks later.  While the band was working on the album in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica during March 2001, producers Sly & Robbie left the percussion and [[Gwen Stefani]]'s original vocal and added a [[toasting|toast]] from Bounty Killer.<ref name="singles">Montoya, Paris and Lanham, Tom.

Like the song's dancehall style, the lyrics depict the band's post-show parties from touring in support of ''Return of Saturn''.  The song details female groupies who attended the parties to hook up with the male band members.  Stefani commented that "if you're talented and you're up there, girls want to make out with you."  Bassist Tony Kanal described it as "a very PG version" of the licentiousness that took place while touring.<ref>Wiederhorn, Jon and Rankin, Rebecca.

Retrieved [[July 12]], [[2007]].</ref>  The song also touches on ''Rock Steady''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s overall theme of Stefani's impatience in her [[long-distance relationship]] with then-boyfriend [[Gavin Rossdale]], as she sits "sipping on chamomile/watching boys and girls and their sex appeal".<ref name="slant">Cinquemani, Sal.

"Hey Baby" is a [[ragga]] song composed in the key of [[E minor]].  It is written in [[common time]] and moves at a moderate tempo of 90 [[beats per minute]].  Stefani's vocal range spans over two octaves in the song, from D<sub>3</sub> to E<sub>5</sub>.<ref name="sheet">Sheet music for "Hey Baby".  Universal-MCA Music Publishing.  2001.</ref>

The song opens with an [[upbeat]] and an [[introduction (music)|introduction]] made up of two lines from the [[refrain|chorus]].<ref name="sheet"/>  In each two-measure line during the first half of the verses, Stefani descends the scale while the keyboard plays the [[off-beat (music)|off-beats]] of the first measure and the [[electric bass]] opens the line with a two-note [[bassline]].  During the second half of the verses, Stefani's vocals are [[overdubbed]], and the instrumentation becomes more frequent.<ref>Guitar tab for "Hey Baby".  [[Hal Leonard Corporation]].  2001.</ref>  Each of the two verses is followed by the chorus, where overdubbing is used on Stefani's vocals to produce [[first inversion]] and normal form [[E minor]] chords.  Bounty Killer then toasts the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], and after a brief section sung by Stefani, the song closes by repeating the chorus twice.<ref name="sheet"/>

==Critical reception==
"Hey Baby" received mixed reviews from music critics.  ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' was unimpressed by the lyrics' [[double entendre]]s and noted that the toast and "deep, booming production save this song from being thin" but that it remained "inane and unengaging".<ref>Delaney, Colleen.

==Music video==
[[Image:HeyBabyVideo.png|thumb|left|Gwen Stefani in the galaxy of floating words from the music video.]]

The song's [[music video]], directed by [[Dave Meyers]], follows the theme of the lyrics.  It shows the band on a tour bus, stopping at a party at Club Poonani.  The members separate when three girls approach the male band members.  Kanal has his picture taken with several women, paying for it by taking money that drummer [[Adrian Young]] earns by hanging from [[gymnastics rings]] naked.  Dumont defeats a woman, portrayed by Sonya Eddy, in an endurance [[drinking game]], and Stefani dances, eventually joining Bounty Killer on stage.<ref name="video">"Hey Baby".  ''[[Making the Video]]''.  [[MTV]].  [[November 6]], [[2007]].</ref>  There are intercut scenes of the band members on a red and black background, a black and white [[houndstooth]] background, and standing on top of the phrases "NO DOUBT", "ROCK STEADY", and "HEY BABY" in red and white.

The video was filmed in three days in [[Boyle Heights]], Los Angeles.<ref>[http://www.bountykiller.com/killerartman/publish/article_158.shtml "No Doubt and Bounty from Orange County."]  Bounty Killer.com.  Retrieved [[July 9]], [[2007]].</ref>  The scenes were designed to recreate the parties that the band attended while recording ''Rock Steady'' in Jamaica.  Young's scene was based on an actual event, where he won [[US$]]200 on a dare to hang upside down and naked on the rings at a club in [[New York]].  Dumont's scene, filmed at Casa Mexicana, is inspired by a similar scene from the 1981 [[Indiana Jones]] film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.<ref name="video"/>

The video was moderately successful.  It debuted at number ten on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]''<ref>[http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=debuts "The TRL Archive - Debuts"].  ATRL.  Retrieved [[July 9]], [[2007]].</ref> and peaked at number five nearly one month later.<ref>[http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=recap&y=2001&m=12 "The TRL Archive - Recap - December 2001"].  ATRL.  Retrieved [[July 9]], [[2007]].</ref>  On [[MuchMusic]]'s ''[[Countdown (MuchMusic TV series)|Countdown]]'', the video reached number eight for two consecutive weeks and remained on the countdown for nine weeks.<ref name="t40c"/>  It won the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[Best Pop Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]] in 2002.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2223890.stm "Eminem scoops MTV video awards"].
