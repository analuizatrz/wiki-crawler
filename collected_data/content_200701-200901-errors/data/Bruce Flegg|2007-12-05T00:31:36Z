Dr '''Bruce Flegg''' (born [[10 March]] [[1954]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]) is the Member for [[Electoral district of Moggill|Moggill]] having been elected in [[Queensland legislative election, 2004|2004]] and re-elected in 2006.

Shortly before the 2006 Queensland State Election Bruce Flegg replaced [[Bob Quinn]] as the leader of the Liberal Party in the Queensland State parliament. This coup came as a surprise to many, particularily Quinn, whose wife Madonna referred to Flegg and his supporters as "a pack of dastards".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/qld/content/2006/s1886212.htm|title=Liberal Leadership Woes|date=March 30, 2007|publisher=ABC}}</ref>

Bruce Flegg's performance as leader during the 2006 election was criticised by members of his own party, his coalition party and the media.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1738417.htm|title=Nats blame Flegg for crushing electoral defeat|date=September 11, 2006|publisher=ABC}}</ref>  Some members of his own party described his performance as a "miserable failure".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/07/1999059.htm|title=Beattie takes swipe at 'one-year' Flegg|date=August 8, 2007|publisher=ABC}}</ref> Flegg blamed "faceless and nameless" members of the Nationals for leaks critical of him.

Flegg's relationship with the leader of the National Party, [[Jeff Seeney]], had been reported as being very poor, particularly so after Flegg fell asleep during Seeney's speech to the Queensland Nationals' State Conference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2007/08/08/1365_gold-coast-top-story.html|title=Flegg's Own Goal Howler|date=August 8, 2007|publisher=Gold Coast Bulletin}}</ref>

On 31 January 2007 Bruce Flegg and Jeff Seeney announced that should the coalition win the next State election the Premier will be [[Jeff Seeney]] even if the Liberal Party won more seats than the National Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21145652-3102,00.html|title=Let Nats Govern|date=January 21, 2007|publisher=Courier Mail}}</ref>  Members of Flegg's party were critical of this decision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21145652-5007200,00.html|title=Let Nats Govern|date=January 21, 2007|publisher=Courier Mail}}</ref> 

On 4 December 2007, Bruce Flegg stood aside as leader of the Queensland Liberals following sustained pressure from some of his Parliamentary colleagues. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22873145-1702,00.html|title=Libs Leadership could be resolved today|date=December 4, 2007|publisher=Courier Mail}}</ref>
