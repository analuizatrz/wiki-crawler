{{nihongo|'''''Cowboy Bebop'''''|カウボーイビバップ|Kaubōi Bibappu}} is a Japanese [[Anime|animated]] [[Television program|television series]].  Directed by [[Shinichirō Watanabe]] and written by [[Keiko Nobumoto]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]. Consisting of 26 episodes, the series follows the adventures of a group of [[bounty hunter]]s traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop, in the year 2071. It is considered one of the best anime series ever made.<ref>''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=632 Newtype Press Release]'' - ''[[Anime News Network]]''</ref>

''Cowboy Bebop'' was a commercial success both in Japan and international markets, notably in the [[United States]]. After this reception, [[Sony Pictures]] released a feature film, ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]'' to theaters worldwide and followed up with an international DVD release. Two [[manga]] adaptations were serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s ''[[Asuka Fantasy DX]]''.

''Cowboy Bebop'' has been strongly influenced by [[American music]], especially the [[jazz]] movements of the 1940s-60s and the early [[rock and roll|rock]] era of the 1950s-70s. Many of its action sequences, from space battles to hand-to-hand [[martial arts]] [[combat]], are set and timed to music. Following the musical theme, episodes are called ''Sessions'', and the episode titles are often borrowed from album or song names ("[[Sympathy for the Devil]]", "[[Honky Tonk Women]]", or "[[My Funny Valentine]]" to name a few), or make use of a genre name ("Mushroom Samba" or "Heavy Metal Queen") indicating a given episode's musical theme.

==Plot==
{{see|List of Cowboy Bebop episodes}}

In the year 2021 AD, the first "Astral Gate" is built in orbit around the Moon; a [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] gateway meant to expedite [[space colonization]] by making travel between planets a matter of days instead of months or years. This gate is destroyed in an incident that comes to be known as the "Gate Accident"; an explosion that shattered a massive piece of the Moon. Lunar debris began to fall upon the Earth with the same frequency as rain, devastating the planet's surface and killing 4.7 billion people. Fifty years later the human race numbers only 1.5 billion, but has colonized the entire [[Solar System]] through the use of perfected Gates.

While the Earth is still inhabited, its few remaining denizens must shelter themselves from the continuing [[impact event|rock falls]] in underground cities. With reconstruction rendered impossible by the rock falls, the human race instead [[terraforming|terraformed]] other [[List of Solar System bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium|bodies]] of the Solar System including a variety of [[space habitat]]s and [[Asteroid mining|industrialized]] [[asteroid]]s. This solar community maintains a high level of racial and cultural diversity, and continues to use a large number of different languages, artwork and governments. However, its economy is predominantly Asian, using a nondivisible currency called the Woolong.

The population crash has led to a relative stagnation in technological development, though the Gates make space travel relatively easy. Directed energy weapons exist, but are large and dependent on heavy power sources. [[Gunpowder]]-based projectile weapons are the mainstay of combat, and many gun models from the beginning of the 20th century continue to be widely used.

As the Gates make it possible to cross the System in a matter of weeks, it became unfeasible for law enforcement to pursue criminals away from a given world. Criminal activity increased at every level of society; small-time criminals could act with relative impunity, and ruthless crime syndicates became as powerful as multinational corporations. In response, the [[bounty system]] of the [[Old West]] was reinstated throughout the System. Bounty hunters are encouraged to capture criminals and return them (alive and relatively unharmed) to the authorities for monetary rewards, in part through a regular television broadcast of ''"Big Shot"'', a bounty-hunter news program featuring Punch and Judy. This TV show is broadcast with a western motif and in the slang of the era, the term "Cowboys" refers to bounty hunters. 

The crew of the spaceship ''Bebop'' are a partnership of "cowboys" (originally Spike & Jet) who travel the [[solar system]] trying to apprehend bounties. The ''Bebop'' is made up of a bridge, general living quarters, storage for food and supplies, and a small hangar to allow docking of smaller one-man space vessels. Jet owns the ''Bebop'' itself, but has partnered with Spike for his diverse combat skills; he is a master of [[Jeet Kune Do]], [[marksmanship]], and space [[dogfight|fighter combat]]. Though he is reluctant to admit it, Jet has also come to rely on Spike for companionship in the normally solitary field of bounty hunting. The entire system is open to them via the Gates, but regularly spend much of their time on Mars, the new hub of human civilization.

Most episodes revolve around attempts to bring in a specific bounty, but the show often shares its focus with the pasts of each of the main characters and of more general past events, which are revealed and brought together as the series progresses. Some of the Bebop's varied targets include small time thugs, gangsters, [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]]s (known as "Net Divers" in slang), religious leaders, psychopaths, genetic experiments, mutant creatures and petty thieves.

==Characters==
{{main|List of Cowboy Bebop characters}}
[[Image:CowboyBebopPo.jpg|thumb|250px|Promotional poster of ''Cowboy Bebop'', featuring the crew of the ''Bebop''.]]
The series features a crew of distinct main characters. The first two introduced in the series are Spike Spiegel and Jet Black. The two pilot their former fishing trawler spaceship, the ''Bebop'', and work as bounty hunters. As the series progresses, more characters are introduced and become members of the ''Bebop'' crew.

Antagonists include a variety of bounties that the crew hunt to collect funding, including Faye. Although the Bebop crew is typically broke, its members manage to keep themselves afloat financially by capturing the occasional bounty-head.

'''[[Spike Spiegel]]''' is a former member of the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate who is haunted by the memory of his time in the organization, namely his romantic relationship with a mysterious woman named [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Julia|Julia]], and his former syndicate partner, [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious]]. 

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Jet Black|Jet Black]]''', a former Inter-Solar System Police (ISSP) officer and the owner of the ''Bebop''. Once called "The Black Dog" by his fellow officers for his relentless nature, he bears a [[cybernetic]] arm as constant reminder of what happened when he rushed into trouble without looking first. Like Spike, he is haunted by the memory of a woman: Alisa, his longtime girlfriend who left him without notice.

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Ein|Ein]]''', a [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi|Welsh Corgi]] and former lab animal identified as a "data dog" by the scientists who created him. The reason for this title is never explained, but it is suggested that he possesses enhanced intelligence, which he displays in subtle ways throughout the series. Despite his enhanced intelligence and comprehension, the rest of the Bebop crew typically fail to notice these qualities.  

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Faye Valentine|Faye Valentine]]''', an [[amnesia]]c awakened from a 54-year cryogenic slumber after being injured. She is tricked into assuming the debt of the man that woke her, and constantly attempts to gamble on quick cash as a solution to her debt. Her gambling and competitive skills are unrivaled as she has won every game in her life, except when playing Spike, when introduced in the series. Her past and her real name are a mystery as the name "Valentine" was given to her by a doctor.  Her history is unraveled progressively throughout the series. 

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV|Edward]]''', a young, eccentric computer genius and master [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]]. Though she is a girl, there is a popular confusion as to Ed's gender due to her name and androgynous appearance. She gave herself the long and fanciful name "Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV" after running away to an orphanage, but after her father is found it is revealed later on that her real name is Françoise Appledelhi. She goes by the name Radical Edward when hacking, and commonly spends the most time with Ein.

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious]]''', Spike's former syndicate partner and the only recurring antagonist of the series. He is seen in several episodes grabbing for power within the organization by killing members of the organization's leadership.  His relationship with Spike and Julia is displayed through flashbacks that Spike experiences, but never explained in detail.

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Julia|Julia]]''', a beautiful and mysterious woman from both Spike and Vicious' pasts. Despite being among the main driving points for the entire series, Julia only appears in flashbacks until the final two episodes of the series. She acts as a stark contrast to the world around her—her blond hair, bright red umbrella and automobile stand out in the otherwise drab environments that she inhabits.

==Reception==
{{Refimprovesect|date=September 2007}}

===Japan===
''Cowboy Bebop'' almost did not appear on [[Japan]]ese broadcast television due to its depictions of violence. It was first sent to [[TV Tokyo]], one of the main broadcasters of anime in Japan. The show had an aborted first run from April 3, 1998 until June 19, 1998 on TV Tokyo, broadcasting only [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 2.2C Stray Dog Strut|episodes 2]], [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 3.2C Honky Tonk Women|3]], [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 7.2C Heavy Metal Queen|7]] to [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 15.2C My Funny Valentine|15]] and [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 18.2C Speak Like a Child|18]].

Later that year, the series was shown in its entirety from October 23 until April 23, 1999, on the satellite network [[WOWOW]]. With the TV Tokyo broadcast slot fiasco, the production schedule was disrupted to the extent that the last episode was delivered to WOWOW on the day of its broadcast. Cowboy Bebop won the [[Seiun Award#Best Media of the Year|Seiun Award]] in 2000. 

The full series has also been broadcast across Japan by the anime television network, [[Animax]], who has also aired the series via its respective networks across Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Asia. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was popular enough that the movie, ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira]]'' (''Knockin' on Heaven's Door''), was commissioned and released in Japan in 2001, and later released in the United States as ''Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'' in 2003.

===Legacy===
A poll in the [[Japan]]ese magazine ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype USA]]'' asked its readers to rank the "Top 25 Anime Titles of All Time"; ''Cowboy Bebop'' placed second (behind ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'') on a list that included such anime as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''.<ref>''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=632 Newtype Press Release]'' - ''[[Anime News Network]]''</ref> In a recent poll by TV Asahi, ''Cowboy Bebop'' was 40th for Japan's Favorite Anime of 2006.<ref name="favanime">[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-10-13/japan's-favorite-tv-anime Japan's Favorite TV Anime]. Anime News Network ([[October 13]], [[2006]]). Retrieved on [[September 10]], [[2007]].</ref> The American Anime magazine ''[[Anime Insider]]'' (No. 50, November 2007) ranked the 50 best anime (available in America) by compiling lists of industry regulars and magazine staff, with ''Cowboy Bebop'' ranked as #1.

In the U.S., [[Cartoon Network]] has regularly rotated ''Cowboy Bebop'' in and out of its [[Adult Swim]] block line-up several times.

''T.H.E.M'' Anime Reviews say the series has "sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind" and that "puts most anime...and Hollywood, to shame."<ref>[http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=413 THEM Anime reviews - ''Cowboy Bebop'']</ref>

==Influence on pop culture==
At the conclusion of the final broadcast of Cartoon Network's long-standing ''[[Toonami]]'' block, the host character TOM (who had been voiced by [[Steven Blum]], the American voice actor who played Spike Spiegel) uttered "Bang" right before the broadcast signed off for the final time, which was also the final line spoken by Spike in the final episode of ''Cowboy Bebop''.

==Soundtrack==
{{main|The Seatbelts}}
One of the most notable elements of ''Cowboy Bebop'' is its music. Performed by [[Yoko Kanno]] and [[The Seatbelts]], a band Kanno assembled to perform music for the series, the jazz and blues themed soundtrack helps to define the show as much as the characters, writing, and even animation. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was voted by [[IGN]] in 2006 as having the greatest soundtrack for an [[anime]].<ref>[http://music.ign.com/articles/708/708910p1.html IGN: Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time], IGN.</ref>

==Continuation rumors==
After the creation of the series, an interviewer asked Watanabe if he had any plans to create more ''Cowboy Bebop'' material. Watanabe responded by saying that he does not believe that he "should just keep on making Cowboy Bebop sequels for the sake of it". Watanabe added that ending production and "to quit while we're ahead when people still want more" is more "in keeping with the ''Bebop'' spirit".<ref name="WatanabeInterviewCBMovie">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20030307023145/www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/interview/index.html The Director's Voice Shinichiro Watanabe Interview]."
