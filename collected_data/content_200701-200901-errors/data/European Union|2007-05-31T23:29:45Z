The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a [[Supranationalism|supranational]] and [[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] union of twenty-seven [[state]]s and a political body. It was established in [[1992]] by the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] (The Maastricht Treaty), and is the de facto successor to the six-member [[European Economic Community]] founded in [[1957]]. Since then new [[Enlargement of the European Union|accessions]] have raised its number of [[European Union member states|member states]], and competences have expanded.

The EU is one of the largest economic and political entities in the world, with a total population of 494 million and a combined nominal [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of €11.6 (US$14.5) trillion in 2006.<ref name=EU> [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/weorept.aspx?sy=2005&ey=2007&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=998&s=NGDPD%2CPPPWGT&grp=1&a=1&pr1.x=50&pr1.y=9 EU nominal GDP 2006], International Monetary Fund, Accessed April 17, 2007</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
[[Image:RobetSchuman.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Robert Schuman]]]]

The EU has evolved from a Western European trade body into the supranational and intergovernmental body that it is today. After the [[Second World War]], an impetus grew in Western [[Europe]] for institutional forms of cooperation (through social, political and economic integration) between states, driven by the determination to rebuild Europe and eliminate the possibility of another war between Germany and France. Eastern Europe, on the other hand, was largely within the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[sphere of influence]], and only in the 1990s did the EU see central and Eastern European states as potential members.

In [[1946]] [[Winston Churchill]] called for a "[[United States of Europe]]" (though without the inclusion of the UK).<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=65 Winston Churchill], www.winstonchurchill.org .Accessed January 25, 2007</ref>  On [[9 May]] [[1950]] the French foreign minister [[Robert Schuman]] presented [[Jean Monnet]]'s proposal for the joint management of France's and West Germany's coal and steel industries. The proposal, known as the "[[Schuman Declaration]]", envisaged the scheme as "the first concrete step towards a European federation".<ref>[http://europa.eu.int/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm]</ref>  It is considered to be the beginning of the creation of what is now the European Union, and led to the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] by [[Germany|West Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[Benelux]] countries. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed in 1951.<ref>[http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm History of the European Union], Europa. Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> 

[[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The founding nations signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]

The first full [[customs union]] - the [[European Economic Community]] - was established by the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 and implemented on [[1st January]] [[1958]]. This later changed to the ''European Community'', which is now the "first pillar" of the European Union created by the [[Maastricht treaty]].  

On [[29 October]] [[2004]], EU member state heads of government and state [[signature|signed]] the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]]. This was later ratified by 17 member states. However, in most cases ratification was based on parliamentary action, rather than popular vote, and the process faltered on [[29 May]] [[2005]] when French voters rejected the constitution 55% to 45%. [[French referendum on the European Constitution|The French rejection]] was followed three days later by a [[Dutch referendum on the European Constitution|Dutch]] one, in which 62% of voters rejected the constitution as well.

==Geography==
[[Image:Vourvourou-Greece.jpg|thumb|200px|right|22 member countries are influenced by extensive coastlines and oceanic climate, ([[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Greece]])]]
{{main|Geography of the European Union|Geography of Europe}}

The territory of the European Union is formed by the territory of its twenty-seven member states, and expands with the accession of new members. It covers an area of 4,422,773 [[square kilometre]]s (1,707,642&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]).<ref name=Area.and.population.figure>Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the European Union, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the European Union.</ref> Extending northeast to Finland, northwest to Ireland, southeast to Cyprus and southwest to Portugal, it represents the [[List of countries by area|seventh largest territory in the world by area]]. It is estimated that the coastline of the European Union is over 150,000 km long.

The EU is not coterminous with Europe: significant parts of the continent (e.g. [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], European [[Russia]]) are outside of the EU. The member states of the EU have [[countries bordering the European Union|land borders]] with 21 other nations. Several overseas territories and dependencies of various member states are also formally part of the EU (e.g. the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] or the [[Canary Islands]]) while in other cases territories associated with member states are not part of the EU (e.g. [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], most territories associated to the United Kingdom, [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] or [[New Caledonia]]).

Including overseas territories of member states, the EU includes most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] to [[Tropical climate|tropical]]. Meteorological averages for the EU as a whole are therefore not meaningful. The majority of the population live in areas with a [[Mediterranean climate]] (southern Europe), a temperate [[maritime climate]] (Western Europe), or a [[Hemiboreal|warm summer continental or hemiboreal]] climate (in eastern member states).

On [[23 July]] [[1952]] six founding members formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), which was transformed into the [[European Community]], later renamed the European Union, in waves of accession:

Note that certain areas of the member countries are not part of the EU, like the [[Channel Islands]], or the [[Faroe Islands]]. Areas that are far from Continental Europe on the other hand may be part of the EU: for instance, the [[Azores]], and [[Madeira]] islands (Portugal), are represented by that country in EU affairs. Also the various French [[overseas department]]s are considered part of France, which is why areas as far from Europe as [[Martinique]] and [[French Guiana]] use the Euro.

==Politics==

{{main|Politics of the European Union|Three pillars of the European Union}}

Supporters of the European Union argue that the growth of the EU has been a force for [[peace]], [[democracy]], and [[prosperity]] for its member states. However, others contend that peace in Europe since [[World War II]] is instead the product of other causes, such as the need for reconstruction after World War II, a collective temporary exhaustion with waging war, and the disparate reasons that caused dictatorships within Europe to end.

The nature and future direction of the European Union itself is a key issue in European politics and a significant issue in the national politics of the member states. General issues include whether or not to belong to the EU, the impact of the EU on the member states, sovereignty issues, economic harmonisation issues, what the EU is becoming and should become (i.e. a single country in itself or a club of individual countries), the ultimate size of the Union, limits on new accession, the pace of new accessions, expansion in membership versus internal integration, a future as a [[political union]] versus a future as a [[free trade zone]], the geographical limits of "Europe" for membership purposes, and the values and historical-cultural identity of the Union. Internal structure, procedures and policies are themselves subject to constant political debate. Specific issues at present include the status and future of the [[European Constitution|constitutional treaty]]; [[enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] on the [[Balkans]] and [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkish accession]]; problems of financial probity and [[democratic deficit|democratic accountability]]; relative economic viability; revision of the rules of the [[Stability and Growth Pact]]; and the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].

Former French President [[Jacques Chirac]] declared this increase in the budget will permit Europe to "finance common policies" such as the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] or the [[Sixth Framework Programme|Research and Technological Development Policy]]. France's demand to lower the [[value added tax|VAT]] in catering was refused.<ref>"[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/30/business/vat.php Poles block EU deal on lower VAT]", ''[[The Times|Times Online]]'', [[31 January]] [[2006]].

The 'pillar' structure created by the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] moved the older policies and activities into the 'first pillar, labeled the 'European Communities'. The more controversial new policy areas - foreign policy, security and defence, asylum and immigration, and judicial co-operation - were moved into two new 'pillars'.

===European Economic Community===
[[Image:Eurocoin 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Euro]] is adopted by 13 countries and is used by 315 million people]]
{{main|European Community}}

A prominent policy goal of the European Union is the development and maintenance of an effective [[single market]]. Significant efforts have been made to create harmonised standards claimed by their proponents to bring economic benefits through creating larger, more efficient markets. Since the Treaty of Rome, policies have implemented [[free trade]] of goods and services among member states, and continue to do so. This policy goal was further extended to three of the four [[EFTA]] states by the [[European Economic Area]], EEA. Common [[EU competition law]] restricts anti-competitive activities of companies (through antitrust law and merger control) and member states (through the State Aids regime). The EU promotes free movement of [[financial capital|capital]] between member states (and other EEA states). The members have a common system of indirect [[taxation]], the [[VAT]], as well as common customs duties and excises on various products.

[[Image:RondoGenMaczka2005.jpg|thumb|200px|left|New member states expect investments financed with EU [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds]], (motorway in [[Katowice]], [[Poland]])]]

They have a [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (with the [[Common Fisheries Policy]]) and the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|structural and cohesion funds]], which improve infrastructure and assist disadvantaged regions. Together they are known as the ''cohesion policies.'' The EU also has funds for emergency financial aid, for instance after natural disasters. The funding extends to programmes in candidate countries and other [[Eastern Europe]]an countries, as well as aid to many developing countries, through programmes such as [[Phare]], [[TACIS]], [[Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession|ISPA]]. The EU also funds research and technological development, through four-year [[Seventh Framework Programme|Framework Programmes]] for Research and Technological Development.

In a more political sense, the EU attempts to create - with much controversy - a sense of European citizenship and European political life. That includes freedom for citizens of the EU to vote and to stand as candidates in local government and [[European Parliament]] elections in any member state.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope/nav/en/citizens/citizenship/citizenship/index.html European citizenship], Europa. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> The European Parliament is now attempting to create pan-European political parties, and almost all members have joined at least a federation of national political parties.

===Common Foreign & Security Policy===
[[Image:Condisolana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Javier Solana]], the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative for the CFSP]] (l.) and  United States Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]]]]
{{Main|Common Foreign and Security Policy}}

Defence and security are traditionally matters of national [[sovereignty]]. 
EU policies in this area were established as the second of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] in the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The ''Common Foreign and Security Policy'' or CFSP were further defined and broadened in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of 1997. It superseded the [[European Political Cooperation]]. The CFSP acknowledges [[NATO]] being responsible for territorial defence of Europe and "peace-making". In 1999 the [[European Council]] took over responsibilities for the implementation  of peace-keeping missions ([[EUFOR]] in Bosnia Herzegovina, Congo) and policing of treaties.  The supervision is coordinated by the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], [[Javier Solana]].

The ''European Security'' and defence Policy is an element of the  CFSP and stipulated the framing for policies that could deal with humanitarian and rescue tasks, and tasks of combat forces. It includes the creation of a 60,000-member [[European Rapid Reaction Force]] for [[peacekeeping]] purposes, an EU [[military]] staff, a [[European Defence Agency]] and an [[European Union Satellite Centre|EU satellite centre]] (for intelligence purposes).

===Police and Judicial Co-operation===
{{Main|Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters}}

The third of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] of the European Union is focusing on cooperation in criminal matters, including sharing of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] (through [[Europol]] and the [[Schengen Information System]]), agreement on common definition of [[crime|criminal offences]] and expedited [[extradition]] procedures.
It is the EU instrument of [[law]] enforcement and combating [[racism]]. 

It was created as the ''Justice and Home Affairs'' pillar in the [[Treaty of Maastricht]]; subsequently the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] transferred the areas of illegal [[immigration]], [[visa (document)|visas]], [[refugee|asylum]], and judicial co-operation to the integrated first ([[European Community]]) pillar.   The term ''Justice and Home Affairs'' now covers these integrated fields as well as the intergovernmental third pillar.
{{-}}

===Foreign relations===
[[Image:Peter Mandelson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Peter Mandelson]], Commissioner of Trade, represents the bloc in the [[WTO]]]]
{{main|Foreign relations of the European Union}}

The foreign relations of the European Union are primarily a domain of the member-states, although the Union as a whole is beginning to exercise some influence through its [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP). External representation is handled by the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and the [[European Commissioner for External Relations]]. The Commission is gaining greater representation in bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and [[G8]].

Policy is agreed on an inter-governmental basis however the general effect of the Union is also felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|Enlargement]]; the attraction of membership is taken as a major factor contributing to reform and stabilisation of the former Communist countries in Eastern Europe. The Union and its member states also [[ECHO (European Commission)|contribute €43 billion in humanitarian aid]]; making it the largest humanitarian aid provider in the world. These factors influencing other countries are generally referred to as "soft power", as opposed to military "hard power".

On the world stage the Union is gaining greater influence and ability to speak as a bloc. All 27 member states are represented in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) through its [[European Commissioner for Trade|Trade Commissioner]], [[Peter Mandelson]]. The latest [[Doha round|WTO negotiation round]] has currently stalled, partly due to European refusal to curtail the agricultural subsidies unless other developed countries would also stop subsidising their agricultural producers. 

Europe has had a long history with the [[United States]], being particularly close during the Cold War. The US initially supported the development of the [[European Community]] and contributed to the defence of the continent through [[NATO]]. However recently there has been friction between the United States and the modern European Union, for example over the [[Iraq war]]. Some individual member state governments have backed the USA over the war revealing weaknesses in forming a coherent foreign policy.

===Enlargement===
[[Image:EUenl.gif|thumb|right|200px|EU enlargement 1952–2007]]
{{main|Enlargement of the European Union|European Union membership criteria}} 

It all started with the six countries of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in [[1952]]. Today there are 27 [[European Union member states]]. There have been six enlargements, with the largest occurring on [[1st May]] [[2004]], when 10 states joined, and the most recent occurring on [[1st January]] [[2007]], when [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] joined. In order to join the European Union, a state needs to fulfill the economic and political conditions generally known as the [[Copenhagen criteria]] (named after the [[Copenhagen]] summit held in June [[1993]]). These basically require a secular, democratic government, rule of law, and corresponding freedoms and institutions. According to the [[Treaty on European Union|EU Treaty]], any enlargement must be agreed to by every current member state as well as the [[European Parliament]].


'''[[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey is an official candidate]]''' to join the European Union. Turkish European ambitions date back to the 1962 Ankara Agreements, and Turkey started preliminary membership negotiations on [[3 October]] [[2005]]. However, analysts believe 2015 is the earliest date the country can join the union because of the large number of economic and social reforms it has to complete, and because the [[2007]]–[[2013|13]] budget does not take into account any of the considerable costs Turkey's accession will involve.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4107919.stm Q&A: Turkey's EU entry talks]", [[BBC News Online]], [[4 October]] [[2005]]. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> Because of its occupation of 1/3 of [[Cyprus]], as well as Turkey's geographic setting (only 3% of its territory lies within Europe), many argue that Turkey must not be accepted to the E.U. However, the [[Copenhagen criteria#Geographic criteria|Copenhagen criteria]] do not impose strict geographic conditions; EU member Cyprus is geographically an island in the Middle East. Lately, there have been reports on growing divisions between the EU and the Turkish government,<ref>"[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8142969 Pulling the rug out from under?]", [[The Economist]], Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>, including discontent on the Turkish side, which feels it is capitulating to EU demands without receiving anything in return for its efforts.

'''[[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia is an official candidate]]''' country to join the EU and started accession negotiations in 2005. In June 2006, the EU officials projected that the accession of Croatia could  happen in 2009. The closure of negotiations for all chapters of the ''[[acquis communautaire]]'' is expected towards the end of 2008, with the signing of the Accession treaty occurring in January or May 2009. Should this timetable be met, ratification by the existing Member States would be expected to take over 12 months, with accession possible some time in 2010 at the earliest.

[[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]] are officially recognized as potential candidates. [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]] have both previously applied for membership, but their applications were withdrawn following negative votes in  separate referendums. [[Iceland]] is also touted as potential applicant but is opposed to the [[Common Fisheries Policy]]. These countries are sometimes said to be within the [[Eurosphere]].

==Institutions and bodies==
[[Image:European Commission EUAVS.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Berlaymont building]] of the [[European Commission]]]]
{{Main|Institutions of the European Union}}

The European Union is governed by a number of institutions, these primarily being the [[European Commission|Commission]], [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and [[European Parliament|Parliament]].

The '''[[European Commission]]''' acts as an [[executive branch|executive]] or [[civil service]] of sorts. It is currently composed of one member from each state (currently 27) and is responsible for drafting all proposed law, a duty on which it maintains a monopoly in order to co-ordinate European Law. It also controls some agencies and the day-to-day running of the Union. Its president is nominated by the European Council then elected by the Parliament.

The '''[[Council of the European Union]]''' (aka the Council of Ministers) forms one half of the Union's [[legislative branch]] (the other being the Parliament). It is composed of the national ministers responsible for the area of EU law being addressed, for example a law regarding agriculture would go to a Council composed of national agriculture ministers. This body should not be confused with the [[European Council]] below or the non-EU body, the [[Council of Europe]]. The body's presidency rotates between the member states every 6 months, though the current president member state co-operates with the previous and future president member state, to provide continuity.

[[Image:EuroparliamentCROPPED.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The  [[Brussels]] [[European Parliament|seat of Parliament]]]]

The '''[[European Parliament]]''' is the only Union body composed of officials directly elected by the citizens of the EU member states. Every 5 years citizens in all member states vote across a few days for 785 "[[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]]" who form the second half of the Union's legislative branch. Its members sit according to political groups rather than nationality and its president is elected by its members.

The '''[[European Central Bank]]''' is controlling the [[monetary policy]] within the [[Eurozone]], consisting of 13 member states. The ECB was established in 1998 and its headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

The [[Judicial branch]] of the Union consists primarily of the '''[[European Court of Justice]]''' composed of one judge nominated by each member-state with the president elected from among those nominees. Below the Court of Justice there is a lower court called the '''[[Court of First Instance]]''' created to lift some of the work load of the Court of Justice. There is also the '''[[European Court of Auditors]]''' which monitors the Union's accounts.

Another major body, though not an official institution, is the '''[[European Council]]''', composed of the heads of government (along with the [[President of the European Commission]]) meeting 4 times a year. It shares its presidency with that of the Council of the European Union. There are also the   two [[Advisory bodies to the European Union|advisory committees]]; the [[Committee of the Regions]] and the [[Economic and Social Committee]].

There is no official European capital, with institutions spread across a number of cities. However, Brussels is often considered the ''de facto'' capital as it hosts most of the primary institutions, including the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]]. The [[European Parliament|Parliament]] also has its second seat in the city. [[Strasbourg]] is the official seat of the [[European Parliament]], meeting there for twelve week-long plenary sessions each year. [[Luxembourg City]] plays host to the [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]] as well as the [[European Court of Justice]], the [[Court of First Instance]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]].

==Law==
[[Image:Consttreat.jpg|right|thumb|200px| [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|The constitutional treaty]] is [[Ratification|ratified]] by 18 member states, and rejected in [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|French]] and [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|Dutch]] referenda.]]
{{main|European Union law}}

European Union law is the first and only example of a [[supranationalism|supranational]] legal framework. According to the [[European Court of Justice]], in one of its earliest cases, it constitutes "a new legal order of international law".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML Van Gend en Loos v. Nederlanse Administratie Der Belastingen], EU-LEX, Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> Sovereign [[nation states]], by becoming EU members, pool their authority for the mutual social and economic benefit of their peoples. The principle of [[subsidiarity]] means that laws are passed at the regional level where they are more effective when member states take action by themselves, while EU law is supreme in its own fields.

The two main treaties which form the basis of EU law are the Treaty of the European Community, or the [[Treaty of Rome]] from 1957, and the Treaty of the European Union, or the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The Treaty of Rome is the so called "first pillar" of the EU. The "European Community" refers to the competence of the EU to act in the social and economic arena. The Maastricht treaty formed the new European Union, and added two further "pillars". These are a common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. In both these fields a consensus among member states is needed to act. 

[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]]]

EU law covers a range as broad as many member states themselves.<ref>see Article 3 TEU for a list</ref> Where a conflict arises between EU law and the law of a member state, EU law takes precedence, so that the law of a member state must be disapplied.<ref>in general, see C 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585, 593; in the UK see, [[Factortame case|''Factortame Ltd. v Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'']]; in Germany see ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 Oct. 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265); in Italy see ''Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; in France see, Raoul George Nicolo [1990] 1 CMLR 173</ref> Both the provisions of the Treaties, and EU regulations are said to have "[[direct effect]]" horizontally. This means private citizens can rely on the rights granted to them (and the duties created for them) against one another. For instance, an air hostess may sue her aeroplane company employer for sexual discrimination.<ref>under Art. 141 TEC, C-43/75 ''Defrenne v. Sabena'' [1976] ECR 455</ref> The other main legal instrument of the EU, "directives", have direct effect, but only "vertically". Private citizens may not sue one another on the basis of an EU directive, since these are meant to be addressed to the member state. Directives allow some choice for member states in the way they translate a directive into national law. Once this has happened citizens may rely on the law that has been implemented. They may only sue the government "vertically" for failing to implement a directive correctly. An example of a directive is the [[Product liability]] Directive,<ref>85/374/EEC</ref> which makes companies liable for death and any other injuries that occur.

{{main|Economy of the European Union}}

Taken as a single entity, the European Union has the largest economy in the world, with an estimated nominal GDP of €11.6 ($14.5) trillion in 2006 accounting for 35% of world GDP (the second largest economy is [[USA]], with a GDP of $13.2 trillion). The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] has projected that in 2007 the [[Eurozone]] will take over from the [[USA|US]] as the driver of world economic growth with its 2.7% GDP growth compared to 2.1 percent in the US.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/24129 Eurozone outracing US on economic growth] EUobserver.com</ref> In 2006, the EU claimed it is estimated 3.5 million jobs were created in the [[Eurozone]]. [[Germany]], the largest economy within the EU, grew 2.7% in 2006 and is expected to grow at around 2.8% in 2007. After growing almost 3% as a whole in 2006 the EU economy is predicted to stay robust well into 2008 with average growth over those two years averaging over 2.5% growth. Many economists agree the EU has attained the capacity for higher growth than historically due to the EU's new member states potential to expand at a higher rate than traditional industrial powers of Europe. 

The European Union is characterized by great national and intra-national economic disparities, reflecting the different economies of its member states. Even corrected for purchasing power, there is a 12-fold difference between the richest [[NUTS-2]] & [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|3]] regions, [[Frankfurt]] (€68,751 [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] per capita),<ref name="Frankfurt_Paris">{{cite web| url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/extraction/evalight/EVAlight.jsp?A=1&language=en&root=/theme1/regio/econ-r/esa95/gdp95/e3gdp95| title=Table:  E3GDP95 =  Gross domestic product (GDP) at current market prices at NUTS level 3

[[Image:Nokian pääkonttori Keilaniemessä.jpg|thumb|200px|left|172 companies of the [[Fortune Global 500]] have their seats in EU countries - [[Nokia]] headquarters, [[Espoo]], [[Finland]].]]

Differences between member states are also significant. GDP per capita is often 10% to 25% higher than the EU average in the "older" western member states, but only comprises one-third to two-thirds of the EU average in most eastern member states, as well as in potential membership candidates such as Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. By comparison, United States GDP per capita is 35% higher than the EU average: Japanese GDP per capita is approximately 15% higher.<ref>[[Eurostat]] News release166/2006,18 December 2006. ''GDP per capita in purchasing power standards. GDP per capita in the Member States ranged from 48% to 251% of the EU25 average in 2005.''</ref>

The European Union is the largest [[Export|exporter]] in the world and the second largest importer.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html CIA rankorder], CIA Worldfactbook,  Accessed May 27, 2007</ref>
Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as [[tariff]]s and [[border control]]s. In the [[eurozone]], trade is aided by adoption of an uniform currency. The [[European Union Association Agreement]] extends such similar economic policies to a much larger range of countries, partly as a so-called soft approach ('a carrot instead of a stick') to influence the politics in those countries.

===Infrastructure===
[[Image:EU Windmill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Wind turbine]]s in [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]], [[Central Scotland]]]]

The EU has a policy to improve cross-border [[infrastructure]], see [[Trans-European Networks]].
The European Union has legislated in the area of energy policy for many years, and evolved out of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] on October 27, [[2005]] in [[London]].

The EU currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], making it the world's leading importer of these fuels.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/ 'Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe], www.msnbc.msn.com . Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

The EU has enacted a series of directives concerning wastewater treatment, drinking water and water resources management that have a profound impact on water and sanitation infrastructure investments in EU member countries (see [[EU water policy]]). In particular the wastewater directive is considered by the European Commission the most cost intensive European legislation in the environmental sector.

The EU directives related to [[waste management]], such as the [[Landfill Directive]] and [[Waste Incineration Directive]] have also had a significant effect on practices in its member states. These relate to the improved use of resources by improving waste treatment according to the [[waste hierarchy]], reducing [[landfill]]ing of [[biodegradable waste]] and increasing [[recycling]] rates.

Member states have legally bound the EU to use 20 percent [[renewable energy]] and cut [[carbon dioxide]] [[Greenhouse gas|emissions]] by at least 20 percent from 1990 levels, by [[2020]].<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/23665 EU sticks out neck in global climate change battle], EUobserver, Accessed 9 March, 2007</ref> Within the same year, one-tenth of all cars and trucks in [[Treaty of Accession 2005|EU 27]] shall be running on [[biofuel]]s made from plants.

{{main|Demographics of the European Union}}

The population of the European Union is that of its [[Member states of the European Union|member states]], and changes with each accession (or, more rarely, secession). Each change in membership also affects demographic averages such as [[life expectancy]] and [[fertility rate]]. The total population of all member countries is approximately 494 million inhabitants [[as of 2007|as of January 2007]].<ref name=Area.and.population.figure>Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the European Union, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the European Union.</ref> Expected short-term accessions (Croatia) will not substantially increase this figure. Growth in the short term is coming from net migration, since deaths outnumbered births in [[2006]]. At 1.52, the EU has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, well below the level required for [[Sub-replacement fertility|replacement]]. After [[2025]], this negative [[natural increase]] will probably exceed net immigration, and (discounting new accessions) population is expected to decline gradually.<ref name="EU25populationprojection">{{PDFlink|[http://intranet.icea.es/pensiones/documentacion/Proy_demog_2004_2050.pdf EU25 population projection]|48.9&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 50174 bytes -->}}, Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

===Largest cities===
{{main|Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|Largest urban areas of the European Union|Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union}}
The European Union is home to more [[Global city|global cities]] than any other region in the world. Over 16 cities with populations over one million inhabitants, counted in its city proper. 
However, different countries deal differently with large cities. The Greek city [[Athens]], for example, has  about 4 million inhabitants, but it has been divided into many municipalities making the city proper of Athens one of the smaller European capitals with about 800,000 inhabitants.
Densely populated regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cites and are now encompassing large metropolitan areas are [[Rhine-Ruhr]] having approximately 10.5 million inhabitants ([[Cologne]], [[Dortmund]], [[Düsseldorf]] et al.), [[Randstad]] approx. 7 million ([[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] et al.), [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Area]] approx. 4 million ([[Frankfurt]], [[Wiesbaden]] et al.) and the [[Upper Silesian Industry Area]] approx. 3.5 million.

The European Parliament, on the other hand, has members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset.<ref>[http://europa.eu/languages/en/document/59#5 Europa:Languages and Europe.

===Religion===

{{further|[[Religion in Europe]]}}

The EU is an officially secular institution, hence neither God, nor Christianity was mentioned in its proposed constitution, in spite of pressure from the churches. Most of the Member States are secular states, although a small minority are not (the United Kingdom, Denmark, Greece and Finland) and others have references to Christianity in their own constitutions while officially remaining secular (e.g. the Irish Republic). Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised the Pope that she will use her influence during Germany's EU presidency to try to include a reference to Christianity and God in a revived constitution.  However, this has provoked opposition, not the least in the German press.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5337166.stm God and the EU Constitution, in European press review]</ref>

A significant religious diversity exists among the populations of EU member states, reflecting their diverse history and culture. Nowadays, religion is on the decline in Europe, to an effect that not all populations have religious majorities. In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]], for example, a majority has no religious affiliation. The most common belief in the EU is [[Christianity]], which can be roughly divided into [[Roman Catholicism]], a wide range of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. The Christian churches have historically wielded much power in Europe.  As a reaction during the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[secularism]] was developed as a political system, allowing for a rise in [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]].

[[Judaism]] has had a long history in Europe&mdash;there were Jewish communities in parts of Europe prior to the rise of the Roman Empire. [[As of 2002]], the European Union had an estimated [[Jewish population]] of something over a million, including about 519,000 in France and about 273,500 in the [[United Kingdom]]. This compares with about 5 million Jews in [[Israel]].<ref>Jewish population figures may be unreliable. These estimates are taken from {{cite web

[[The Republic of Kalmykia]]. Alone among the peoples of Europe, the Kalmyks' national religion is Buddhism. It is remarkable for being the only area of Europe in which the dominant religion has been [[Buddhism]]. 

The recent influx of immigrants to the EU nations has brought in various religions of their native homelands, including [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Bahá'í Faith|the Bahá'í Faith]] and [[Sikhism]].

==Education and science==
[[Image:Universitetsbyggnaden,_Lund.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Lund University]] main building, built in 1882, [[Sweden]]]]
{{main|Education in the European Union}}

The [[European Commission]] initiated the [[ERASMUS programme]] for [[higher education]].
It was established in 1987 and forms a major part of the EU [[Socrates programme|Socrates II programme]]. Its name is an abbreviation of "European Region Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students" and has been styled after the life of [[Desiderius Erasmus]]. It was incorporated into the [[Socrates programme]] when that programme was established in 1995. The Socrates programme ended in 1999 and was replaced with the Socrates II programme in 2000. Other educational programmes include Leonardo (secondary schools), Grundtvig (adult learning) and Arion (teaching decision-makers).

The stated aim of ERASMUS is to encourage and support [[academic mobility]] of [[higher education]] students and teachers within the European Union, the [[European Economic Area]] countries of [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] as well as the candidate country [[Turkey]]. 2,199 [[higher education]] institutions are participating in ERASMUS across the 31 countries involved in the [[Socrates programme]]. 1.4 million students have already taken part.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Table 8: Actual Number of ERASMUS Students by Country of Home institution 1987/88-2004/05 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/socrates/erasmus/statisti/table8.pdf|format=PDF}} Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

[[Image:1Ariane5LaunchArianespace.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Ariane 5]] is an [[expendable launch system]]]]

Member states of the EU are, along with other European nations and several international NGOs, signatories to  the [[Bologna process]].  This is an attempt to create a [[European higher education area]], by making [[academic degree]] standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout [[Europe]]. It is named after the place it was proposed, the [[University of Bologna]] with the signing, in [[1999]], of the [[Bologna declaration]] by ministers of education from 29 European countries in the Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Governmental meetings have been held in [[Prague]] ([[2001]]), [[Berlin]] ([[2003]]) and [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] ([[2005]]); the next meeting will take place in [[London]] in Spring 2007.

The [[Galileo positioning system]] (or simply 'Galileo'), is a proposed [[Global Navigation Satellite System]], to be built by the European Union and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).
The current project plan has the system as operational by 2010. Several other nations are joining the
project co financing the development such as China, Israel, India, Morocco or South Korea. ESA is a non-EU organisation and its membership includes non-EU countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Norway]]. Both countries ''are'', however, within the [[EFTA]]. There are ties between those organisations, with various agreements in place and being worked on, to establish the legal status of ESA with regard to the EU.<ref>ESA information on its relationship to the EU. [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFEPYV1SD_index_0.html]</ref> There are common goals between ESA and the EU, and ESA has an EU liaison office in Brussels.

The EU is also sponsoring a large number of research projects aimed at academics and institutes, organised in frameworks of calls. From 2007 the EU has opened its 7th framework for grant applications.

==Culture==
[[Image:Sibiuphoto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One city is the [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2007 - [[Sibiu]], [[Romania]]]]
{{main|Cultural policies of the European Union}}

Supporters of [[European integration]] often appeal to a European historical narrative, typically including [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], the [[feudalism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], 19th century [[Liberalism]] and (sometimes) negative elements such as the [[World Wars]]. This history is assumed to be the source of European values. The status of [[Christianity]] as 'European heritage' is controversial, and has consequences for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]]. The [[European Convention]] rejected inclusion of a reference in the proposed [[European Constitution]] to Christianity and/or God. The text finally adopted in the [[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Preamble|Preamble]] reads:

:''DRAWING INSPIRATION from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law,...''

Attitudes and values of the EU population are very diverse, influenced by [[social class]], religion, level of education, and [[ethnicity]], and they are not necessarily either European or national in character. The interests of member [[state]]s are mainly economic and political in nature.

[[Image:Luxembourg0080.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The cultural capitals are designated for a period of one year ([[Luxembourg]])]]

There is no single culture or lifestyle common to the entire EU population. Some are local, national or regional. There are aspects of popular culture which can be found all over the EU, such as [[Football (soccer)|football]], but none are limited to the EU (they may be equally influential in non-member states in Europe, and some are global).

Cultural cooperation  ''between'' member states has become a community competency since its inclusion in 1992 in the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Actions taken in the cultural area by the European Union include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme, the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme, the [[European Cultural Month]] event, the [[Media Plus]] programme, experimental actions and the awarding of various grants.

The European Union gave grants to 233 cultural projects in 2004 and launched a webportal dedicated to Europe and Culture, responding to the [[European Council]]'s expressed desire to see the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means."

===Sport===
[[Image:Campnoumatch.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in EU countries ([[:en:Nou Camp |Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]])]]
{{main|Sport policies of the European Union}}

Sports, including [[spectator sports]], are popular in EU countries, the most popular being [[Football (soccer)|football]] and the second most popular [[basketball]]{{fact}}. [[Cycling]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[water polo]], and [[field hockey]] are also widely watched and played in the EU. Other sports are favorites in fewer countries, such as [[ice hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[motorsports]]; and several sports are only played to a significant extent in one or a few countries (e.g. [[cricket]] in the UK, [[hurling]], [[Gaelic handball]] and [[Gaelic football]] in Ireland and [[korfball]] in the Netherlands and Belgium).

Although it recently launched an anti-doping convention, the European Union plays a minor and mostly indirect role in sport policy. Sports are normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union. Sports are also organized nationally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally. The European Union does not have specific sports policies. The role of the EU could increase, if (for example) the [[European Constitution]] were to be ratified.

Yet other policies of the EU can have an impact on sports, as famously exemplified by the [[Bosman ruling]], which, among other things, prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players from other EU states. This ruling subsequently forced [[UEFA]] to modify the rules for all its European members. The Bosman ruling also gave all EU players the right of [[free transfer (football)|free transfer]] after expiration of their contracts.
