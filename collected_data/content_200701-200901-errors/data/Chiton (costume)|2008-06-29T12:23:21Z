A '''chiton''' ([[Ancient Greek]] ''khitōn'') was a form of clothing in [[Ancient Greece]], worn by both women and men. There are two forms of chiton.  The Doric Chiton is a single rectangle of fabric with an overfold called an apotygma.  It is draped and fastened at the shoulder by pins. The Ionic Chiton is draped without the fold and held in place at the shoulder by several small pins.  A large belt, called the ''zoster'' could be worn over the chiton, usually under the breast ("high-girdled") or around the waist ("low-girdled"). A double-girdled style also existed. The chiton was often worn in combination with the heavier [[himation]], which had the role of a cloak. When used alone (without a himation), the chiton was called a ''monochiton''. A long chiton which reached the heels was called a ''chiton poderes'', while a longer one which dragged the ground was called a ''chiton syrtos''.

It was the outfit of [[Aphrodite]] because it was considered very feminine, although men also wore it. [[Dionysus]] is often depicted wearing it. The chiton was also worn by the Romans, who referred to it as a ''tunica''
