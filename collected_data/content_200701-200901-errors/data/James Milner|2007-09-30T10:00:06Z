'''James Philip Milner''' (born [[January 4]] [[1986]], [[Wortley, West Yorkshire|Wortley]], [[West Yorkshire]]) is an [[English people|English]] [[footballer]] who plays as a [[winger (sport)|winger]] and left-sided [[midfielder]] for the English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. 

As a child, Milner was recognised as a talent in football, [[cricket]] and [[long-distance track event|long distance running]]. He represented his school in each, and also played football for teams from [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]] and [[Horsforth]]. He supported [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] from a young age and was a [[season ticket]] holder at the club before becoming a ball boy.

Milner began his career at Leeds United, joining the Leeds United academy. He was later taken on as a trainee, and made his first appearance for the first team in 2002, aged only 16. He achieved prominence by becoming the youngest player ever to score in the [[Premier League]], aged 16 years and 309 days. 

While at Leeds United, he spent some time on loan to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] to gain first team experience. Following his move to Newcastle United, he was loaned to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] during the 2005–06 season. He has since established himself in the Newcastle first team and has now made over a hundred appearances for them. He creates scoring chances and  does not score many goals. Outside of football he is an easygoing person who rarely speaks to the media. At international level, he has made a record number of appearances for the [[England U21 national football team|England Under-21]] side. He remains part of the Newcastle starting eleven, featuring regularly in domestic and European games.
==Early life==
Born in [[Wortley, West Yorkshire|Wortley]], and raised in [[Horsforth]], [[Leeds]], Milner played most of his football as a child for Westbrook School in Horsforth. While playing there, Graeme Coulson, a coach from [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]], recognised his talent and asked who he was. Coulson persuaded Milner to play for his Rawdon side in various tournaments, and the team went on to win a "prestigious" tournament in Rawdon Meadows with Milner scoring four goals in the final.<ref name="Milner child"/>

==Career==
Milner has played for four major national clubs at senior level: [[Leeds United]], [[Swindon Town]] (on loan from Leeds), [[Newcastle United]] and [[Aston Villa]] (on loan from Newcastle). He has also played for the England Under-21 international side, appearing in over thirty matches. He once held the record for the youngest player ever to score in the [[Premier League]], as well as second youngest player ever to play in the Premier League.
===Leeds United===

Milner's début for [[Leeds United]] came on [[10 November]] [[2002]] when he replaced [[Jason Wilcox]] for the final six minutes in a game against [[West Ham United]].

At the start of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003&ndash;04 season]], Milner was sent on a month-long loan to [[Football League One|Division Two]] side [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] to gain experience as a first team player, which he saw as a valuable experience.<ref name="findarticles"/> He spent a month with Swindon, scoring two goals in six games. On the international scene, Milner continued to develop, representing the England Under-20 team at the [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship|2003 World Youth Championship]]. Not long after, [[Peter Taylor]] called him up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 side]], for which he débuted  against [[Sweden national under-21 football team|Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Chopra earns U21s draw | author=Gerry Cox | url=http://www.thefa.com/England/U21s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/03/SwedenU21vEnglandU21_MR.htm | accessdate=June 20 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref>

However, Leeds United's fortunes differed, and they struggled to keep their position in the league. Milner believed the experience made him stronger emotionally and taught him how to deal with team problems.<ref name="findarticles"/> Leeds's [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] led to speculation over Milner's future at the club, although he had signed a five-year deal with Leeds the previous year.

The final total paid was £5,000,000 after a certain number of appearances for the new club.

His first Premier League game for Newcastle was a 2&ndash;2 draw against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], in which he played on the right wing despite having regularly featured on the left for Leeds.

Things changed for Milner after [[Bobby Robson]], who Milner considered his mentor, was sacked and replaced by [[Graeme Souness]]. Despite starting in 13 league games, the midfielder only played his first full Premier League game for Newcastle on [[24 April]] [[2005]]. By the end of the season, he had made 41 appearances in all competitions and scored once. Souness remarked controversially that the club would not win "with a team of James Milners". Milner's response to this was reported as "mature", although he was frustrated at not being used as a starter for most of the season.<ref name="Rooney">{{cite web

At the start of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005&ndash;06]] season, Milner scored his first European goal. This was in a 3&ndash;1 win away against [[FK ZTS Dubnica]] in the [[Intertoto Cup]],<ref>{{cite web

Milner's run of form continued when he scored again in the next round against [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo la Coruña]], but a clause in Newcastle's purchase of [[Nolberto Solano]] from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] resulted in Milner being loaned to Villa for the rest of the season.

Milner made his Villa début on [[12 September]] in a Premiership match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]], and scored his first goal for the club in a 1&ndash;1 draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on [[17 September]]. He then helped his side recover from being 3&ndash;1 down at half-time against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], scoring two goals to help the side to an 8&ndash;3 win. Although Villa made a poor start to the season, Milner remained confident that they would recover after a break for international duty, praising the quality of the squad and the team's spirit.<ref name="team">{{cite web

Negotiations between Villa and Newcastle began in May 2006 regarding Villa's desire to sign Milner permanently. Newly appointed Newcastle manager [[Glenn Roeder]] appeared to have more appreciation for Milner's ability than Souness had shown, and expressed his desire to keep him at Newcastle. With a lack of transfer funds at Villa, in addition to a change of management at the club, a deal appeared unlikely. In June, Villa rejected an offer of Milner as part of a trade for [[Gareth Barry]].<ref>{{cite web

Villa made an improved offer to Newcastle on [[30 August]], which was accepted by Newcastle chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]]. Media sources quoted the transfer fee as being £4,000,000. However at the last moment, Newcastle recalled Milner and the talks broke down.<ref name="Roeder">{{cite web

He also highly praised Milner's ability, the way he had handled the Villa transfer fiasco, and confirmed he would play him in "plenty of games".<ref name="Roeder"/> This proved to be the case, as Milner started the season playing regularly in the first team and remained a starter for the entire season. He also continued to impress at international level, helping the England Under-21 side to reach the playoffs of the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|Under-21 European Championship]] qualifiers. He scored the winning goal of a 3&ndash;2 win over [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|Switzerland]], securing England a place in the playoffs. Newcastle made a poor start to the season in the Premier League, but Milner played a key role in helping them advance through the group stage of the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]]. Rumours began to spread in December 2006 that he would be sold during the [[transfer window]], although these were dismissed by Milner and Roeder.<ref>{{cite web
