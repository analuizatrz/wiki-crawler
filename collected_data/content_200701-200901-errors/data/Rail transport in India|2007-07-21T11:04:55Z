'''Rail transport''' is a commonly used mode of long-distance [[transport in India|transportation]] in [[India]]. Rail operations are largely run by a state-owned company, [[Indian Railways]]. The rail network traverses the length and width of the country, covering a total length of 63,140&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] (39,233&nbsp;[[mile]]s).<ref name=salient>{{Cite web

In 1951 the systems were [[nationalisation|nationalised]] as one unit—[[Indian Railways]]—to form one of the largest networks in the world. [[Locomotive]]s manufactured at several places in India are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. [[railway signal|Colour signal lights]] are used as signals, but in some remote areas of operation, the older [[semaphore]]s and discs-based signalling are still in use. Accommodation classes range from general through first class AC. Trains have been classified according to speed and area of operation. Many trains are officially identified by a four-digit code, though many are commonly known by unique names also. Ticketing system has been computerised to a large extent, and there are reserved as well as unreserved categories of tickets.

==History==
[[Image:Bombay-Thana-train-1853-far.png|frame|A photo of India's first passenger train between [[Bombay]] and [[Thana]] in 1853.]]
{{main|History of rail transport in India}}

The British administration pondered over setting up rail systems in India in early 1830s. In 1844, [[Governor-General of India]] [[Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]] allowed private entrepreneurs to set up rail systems in India. [[British East India Company|East India Company]] was asked to help the  private rail companies. Over the next few years, rail systems were rapidly created in India by a number of private investors. The first train in India became operational on [[December 22]] [[1851]], and was used to haul construction material in [[Roorkee]]. Less than two years later, on [[April 16]] [[1853]], the first passenger train between [[Bori Bunder]], [[Bombay]] and [[Thane|Thana]] covering a distance of {{convert|34|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} was inaugurated, formally heralding the birth of passenger railways in India.<ref name=acharya>{{cite journal

The British government encouraged the setting up of railway companies by private investors under a scheme that would guarantee an annual return of five percent during the initial years of operation.<ref name=netzone>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianetzone.com/3/indian_railways.htm |title=Indian Railways |accessdate= 2007-06-25 |publisher=indianetzone.com }}</ref><ref name=EIRBanglapedia>{{cite web |url=http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/E_0007.htm |title=East Indian Railway |accessdate=2007-06-25 |last= Islam|first= Sirajul|work=Banglapedia |publisher= Asiatic Society of Bangladesh }}</ref> Once completed, the company would then be transferred to the government, but the original company would retain operational control. This network had a route mileage of about {{convert|14500|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} by 1880, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, [[Madras]] and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896 sent engineers and locomotives to help build the [[Uganda Railway]]s.

[[Image:India-rail-1870.png|thumb|Extent of [[Great Indian Peninsular Railway]] network in 1870. The GIPR was one of the largest rail companies at that time.]]
Soon various [[Princely state|independent kingdoms]] started constructing their own rail systems. A Railway Board assumed office in 1905,<ref name=board>{{Cite web

  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> The Department of Commerce and Industry<ref name=board/> oversaw the functioning of the Railway Board which consisted of three members—a bureaucrat serving as the chairman, a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a tidy profit. In 1907, almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government.

The following year, the first [[electric locomotive]] made its appearance. With the arrival of [[World War I|First World War]], the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. By the end of the First World War, the railways had suffered immensely, and were in a poor state. The government took over the management of the Railways and removed the link between the finances of the Railways and other governmental revenues in 1920. 

The [[World War II|Second World War]] severely crippled the railways as trains were diverted to the [[Middle East]], and the railway workshops converted into munitions workshops. At the time of independence in 1947, a big chunk of the railways went to the then newly formed [[Pakistan]]. A total of forty-two separate railway systems, including thirty-two lines owned by the former Indian princely states were amalgamated as a single unit which was christened as the ''Indian Railways''.

The existing rail networks were abandoned in favour of zones in 1951<ref>{{Cite web

  |publisher=MouthShut.com, Inc}}</ref> As the [[economy of India]] improved, almost all railway production units were indigenised. By 1985, steam locomotives were phased out in favour of diesel and electric locomotives. The entire railway reservation system was streamlined with computerisation in 1995. As of 2007, Indian Railway covers twenty-five states and three [[union territories]] ([[National Capital Territory of Delhi|Delhi]], [[Puducherry]] and [[Chandigarh]]). [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Meghalaya]] are the only states not connected.

==Track==
[[Image:Irbgtrack.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Broad gauge]] is the most predominant [[rail gauge|gauge]] used by the Indian railway.]]
The total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 108,805&nbsp;km (67,608&nbsp;miles) while the total route kilometre of the network is 63,465 km.<ref name="Yearbook817">{{cite book |title=India Yearbook 2007 |publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting,Govt. Of India |isbn=81-230-1423-6 |pages=p 817 }}</ref> About 28% of the route-kilometre and 40% of the total track kilometre is electrified.<ref name="Yearbook817"/>  Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]] (47 to 99&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]]). Indian railways uses three gauges, the [[Broad gauge]] (wider than the [[standard gauge]] — 4&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]] 8½&nbsp;[[inch|in]] (1,435&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]])); the [[metre gauge]]; and the [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] (narrower than the standard gauge).

Broad gauge — 1,676&nbsp;mm (5.5&nbsp;ft) — is the most widely used gauge in India with 89,771&nbsp;km (55,781&nbsp;miles) of track. In some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge — 1,000&nbsp;mm (3.28&nbsp;ft) — is common, although the [[Unigauge project]] is in progress to convert all track to broad gauge. Narrow Gauge is present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauge covers a total of 3,651&nbsp;km (2,269&nbsp;miles). The [[Nilgiri Mountain Railway]] and the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]] are two notable hill lines that use narrow gauge.<ref>{{Cite web

[[Rail tracks|Sleepers]] used in most places are made of prestressed [[concrete]], steel and cast iron pots, though [[teak]] sleepers are still in use on few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper which is in wide use today is based on RDSO Drawing No. RDSO=T-2496. Metal sleepers were also extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track [[temperature]]. The greatest temperature variations occur in [[Rajasthan]], where the difference may exceed 70&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (158&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]).

==Locomotives==
{{main|Indian locomotives}}
Indian Railways use a specialised classification code for identifying its locomotives. The code is usually three or four letters, followed by a digit identifying the model (either assigned chronologically or encoding the power rating of the locomotive).<ref name=irfcalocogen>{{Cite web
  | title = Locomotives — General Information – I
  | url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco.html | accessdate = 2007-06-04
  |work=IRFCA.org
  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> This could be followed by other codes for minor variations in the base model.

The three (or four) letters are, from left to right, the gauge of tracks on which the locomotive operates, the type of power source or fuel for the locomotive, and the kind of operation the locomotive can be used for.<ref name=irfcalocogen/> The gauge is coded as 'W' for broad gauge, 'Y' for metre gauge, 'Z' for the 762&nbsp;mm narrow gauge and 'N' for the 610&nbsp;mm narrow gauge. The power source code is 'D' for diesel, 'A' for AC traction, 'C' for DC traction and 'CA' for dual traction (AC/DC). The operation letter is 'G' for freight-only operation, 'P' for passenger trains-only operation, 'M' for mixed operation (both passenger and freight) and 'S' for shunting operation. A number alongside it indicates the power rating of the engine.<ref name=irfcalocogen/> For example '4' would indicate a power rating of above 4,000&nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] (2,980&nbsp;[[kilowatt|kW]]) but below 5,000&nbsp;hp (3,730&nbsp;kW). An alphabet following the number is used to give an exact rating. For instance 'A' would be an additional 100&nbsp;horsepower; 'B' 200&nbsp;hp and so on. For example, a WDM-3D is a broad-gauge, diesel-powered, mixed mode (suitable for both freight and passenger duties) and has a power rating of 3400&nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] (2.5&nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]]).

The most common diesel engine used is the [[WDM-2]], which entered production in 1962. This 2,600&nbsp;hp (1.9&nbsp;MW) locomotive was designed by [[Alco]] and manufactured by the [[Diesel Locomotive Works]], [[Varanasi]], and is used as a standard workhorse.<ref name=irfcalocospecs>{{Cite web

  |work=IRFCA.org
  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> It is being replaced by more modern engines, ranging in power up to 4000&nbsp;hp (3&nbsp;MW). 
[[Image:Darjeeling Himalayan Railway.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]] is a [[World Heritage Site]], and one of the few steam engines in operation in India.]]
There is a wide variety of electric locomotives used, ranging between 2800 to 6350&nbsp;hp (2.1 to 4.7&nbsp;MW).<ref name=irfcalocospecs/> They also accommodate the different track voltages in use. Most electrified sections in the country use 25,000&nbsp;[[volt]] [[alternating current|AC]], but railway lines around [[Mumbai]] use the older 1,500&nbsp;V [[direct current|DC]] system.<ref name=irfcaparanjape>{{Cite web

  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> Thus, Mumbai and surrounding areas are the only places where one can find AC/DC dual locomotives of the WCAM and WCAG series. All other electric locomotives are pure AC ones from the WAP, WAG and WAM series. Some specialized [[electric multiple unit]]s on the [[Western Railway (India)|Western Railway]] also use dual-power systems. There are also some very rare battery-powered locomotives, primarily used for shunting and yard work.

The only steam engines still in service in India operate on two heritage lines ([[Darjeeling]] and [[Ooty]]) and on the tourist train ''[[Palace on Wheels]]''.<ref>{{Cite web

==Traction==
As of March 2007, 17810&nbsp;km of the total 63,465&nbsp;km route length is electrified.<ref name=coreGI>{{cite web |url=http://www.core.railnet.gov.in/general/general1.htm |title=General Information |accessdate=2007-06-25|work=Central Organisation for Railway Electrification |publisher=Ministry of Railways, Government of India}}</ref> Most places use 25,000&nbsp;V AC through overhead [[catenary]] delivery.<ref name=irfcatraction>{{Cite web
  | title = Electric Traction - I
  | url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-elec.html  | accessdate = 2007-06-19
  |work=IRFCA.org
  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> A major exception is the entire Mumbai section, which uses 1,500&nbsp;V DC.<ref name=irfcatraction/> This is currently undergoing change to the 25,000&nbsp;V system, and is scheduled for completion by 2008. Another exception is the [[Kolkata]] [[Metro]], which uses 750&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC delivered through a [[third rail]].

Traction voltages are changed at two places close to [[Mumbai]]. [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]] trains passing through [[Igatpuri]] switch from AC to DC using a neutral section that may be switched to either voltage while the locomotives are decoupled and swapped. [[Western Railway]] trains switch power on the fly, in a section between [[Virar]] (DC) and [[Vaitarna]] (AC), where the train continues with its own momentum for about 30&nbsp;m through an unelectrified section of [[catenary]] called a ''dead zone''.<ref name=irfcatraction/> All electric engines and EMUs operating in this section are the necessary AC/DC dual system type (classified "WCAM" by Indian Railways).

==Signalling systems==
{{seealso|Railway signal|Railway signalling}}
The Indian Railways makes use of [[railway signal|colour signal lights]], but in some remote areas of operation, the older [[semaphore]]s and discs-based signalling (depending on the position or colour) are still in use.<ref name=irfcasignal>{{Cite web
  | title = Signalling System
  | url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-signal.html  | accessdate = 2007-06-04
  |work=IRFCA.org
  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> Except for some high-traffic sections around large cities and junctions, the network does not use [[Railway signaling#Modern railway signalling|automatic block systems]]. Safety therefore depends completely on the skill and vigilance of the personnel operating the individual signals and the drivers.

Coloured signalling makes use of multi-coloured lighting and in many places is automatically controlled. There are three modes:<ref name=irfcasignal/>
* Two aspect signalling which makes use of a red (bottom) and green (top) lamp 
* Three aspect signalling which makes use of an additional amber lamp in the centre
* Four (multiple) aspect signalling makes use of four lamps, the fourth is amber and is placed above the other three.

Multiple aspect signals, by providing several intermediate speed stages between 'clear' and 'on', allow high-speed trains sufficient time to brake safely if required. This becomes very important as train speeds rise. Without multiple-aspect signals, the stop signals have to be placed very far apart to allow sufficient braking distance and this reduces track utilization. At the same time, slower trains can also be run closer together on track with multiple aspect signals.

Semaphores make use of a mechanical arm to indicate the line condition.
Several subtypes are used:<ref name=irfcasignal/>
* Two aspect lower quadrant
* Three aspect modified lower quadrant
* Multiple aspect upper quadrant
* Disc-based: These signals are located close to levers used to operate points. They are all two-aspect signals.

==Production units==
Locomotives and coaches are produced in the following locations in India.<ref name=irfcalocogen/> 
* '''CLW''': The [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] in [[Chittaranjan]] makes electric locomotives.
* '''DLW''': The [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] in [[Varanasi]] makes diesel locomotives.
* '''ICF''': The [[Integral Coach Factory]] in [[Perambur]] makes [[integral coach]]es. These have a [[monocoque]] construction, and the floor is an integral unit with the undercarriage. 
* '''RCF''': The [[Rail Coach Factory]] in [[Kapurthala]] also makes coaches for the Indian Railways.
* '''RWF''': The [[Rail Wheel Factory]] at [[Yelahanka]] manufactures wheels and axles.
*'''Others''': Some electric locomotives have been supplied by [[BHEL]], and locomotive components are manufactured in several other plants around the country.

==Research and development==
The Research, Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) at [[Lucknow]] is the research and development  wing of the Indian Railways.<ref name="yearbook">{{cite book |title=India Yearbook 2007 |publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India |isbn=8123014236 |pages=p.819 }}</ref><ref name=Wadhwa>{{cite journal

At the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the [[caboose|guard's cabin]]. It is fitted with a [[transceiver]] and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs. A standard passenger rake generally has four general compartments, two at the front and two behind, of which one is exclusively for ladies. The exact number varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some trains a separate mail compartment is present. In long-distance trains a [[pantry]] car is usually included in the centre.

==Nomenclature==
[[Image:Bholu.png|thumb|200px|Bholu is the mascot of the Indian Railways, adopted in 2003.]]
Trains are sorted into various categories which dictate the number of stops along their route, the priority they enjoy on the network, and the fare structure. Each express train is identified by a four-digit number<ref name=irfcanumber>{{Cite web

== Ticketing ==
[[Image:IR sample ticket.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An Indian Railway Ticket from [[Chennai]] to [[Vijayawada]] by [[Howrah]] Mail.]]
India has one of the lowest train fares in the world, and passenger traffic is heavily subsidised by freight.<ref name=Joshi>{{cite book |last=Joshi  |first=V |coauthors= I. M. D. Little |title=India's Economic Reforms, 1991-2001 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r31MYIrISFMC&pg=PA184&ots=mYUZDCBGxI&dq=indian+rail&as_brr=3&sig=DXx4Fwi-7b5zV7bvWF6quBT_3i0 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |date= 1996-10-17 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA  |isbn=0198290780 |pages=p.184 |chapter=Industrial Policy and Factor Markets }}</ref> Until the late 1980s, Indian Railway ticket reservations were done manually. In late 1987, the Railways started using a computerised ticketing system. The entire ticketing system went online in 1995 to provide up to date information on status and availability. Today the ticketing network is computerised to a large extent, with the exception of some remote places. In large cities tickets can be booked for any two points in the country, which may not be available in smaller stations. Tickets can also be booked through the [[internet]] and via [[mobile phone]]s, though this method carries an additional surcharge.

Discounted tickets are available for [[senior citizen]]s (above sixty years) and some other categories of passengers including the disabled, students and high ranking government officials. One compartment of the lowest class of accommodation is earmarked for ladies in every passenger carrying train. Some berths or seats in  sleeper class and second class are also earmarked for ladies.<ref name=reserverules>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianrail.gov.in/resrules.html |title= Reservation Rules|accessdate= 2007-06-25  |publisher= Indian Railways}}</ref> Season tickets permitting unlimited travel on specific sections or specific trains for a specific time period may also be available. Foreign tourists can buy an [[Indrail Pass]],<ref name=irfcafaqtravel>{{Cite web

  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> which is modelled on the lines of the [[Eurail Pass]], permitting unlimited travel in India for a specific time period.

For long-distance travel, reservation of a berth can be done for comfortable travel up to two months prior to the date of intended travel.<ref name=reserverules/> Details such as the name, age and concession (if eligible) are required and are recorded on the ticket. The ticket price usually includes the base fare which depends on the classification of the train (example: super-fast surcharge if the train is classified as a super-fast), the class in which one wishes to travel and the reservation charge for overnight journeys.

If a seat is not available, then the ticket is given a wait listed number; else the ticket is ''confirmed'', and a berth number is printed on the ticket. A person receiving a wait listed ticket will have to wait until there are enough cancellations to enable him to move up the list and obtain a confirmed ticket.<ref name=reserverules/><ref name=irfcafaqtravel/> If his ticket is not confirmed on the day of departure, he may not board the train. Some of the tickets are assigned to the RAC or [[Reservation against Cancellation]] which is between the waiting list and the confirmed list.<ref name=irfcafaqtravel/><ref name=reserverules/> These allow the ticket holder to board the train and obtain an allotted seat decided by a ticket collector, after the ticket collector has ascertained that there is a vacant (absentee) seat.

Reserved Railway Tickets can  be booked through the website of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited,<ref name=irctchome>{{cite web |url=http://www.irctc.co.in/ |title= Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited|accessdate= 2007-06-03|publisher= www.irctc.co.in}}</ref> and also through mobile Phones and [[Short message service|SMS]]. Tickets booked through this site are categorised in to iTickets and eTickets. iTickets are those, which are booked by a passenger and then printed and delivered to the passenger for carrying during journey. eTickets are those, which the passenger can print himself at his end and carry while travelling. For booking an eTicket, one needs one of the authorised valid Photo Identity Card. Cancellation of eTickets are also done online, without the requirement for the passenger to go to any counter. Non-reserved tickets are available for purchase on the platform at any time before departure. A non-reserved ticket holder may only board the general compartment class. All suburban networks issue non-reserved tickets valid for a limited time period. For frequent commuters, a season pass (monthly or quarterly) guarantees unlimited travel between two stops.

==International links==
India has rail links with [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]].<ref name=irfcainternational>{{Cite web

  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> It also plans to install a rail system in southern [[Bhutan]]. Before the [[Partition of India]] there were eight rail links between what are now India and Pakistan. However, currently there are only two actively maintained rail links between the two countries. The first one is at [[Wagah]] in [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The ''[[Samjhauta Express]]'' plies on this route from  [[Amritsar]] in India to [[Lahore]] in Pakistan.<ref name=irfcainternational/> The second one, opened in February 2006 runs between [[Munabao]] (in [[Rajasthan]] in India) and [[Khokhrapar]] (in [[Sindh]] in Pakistan). Other disused links are:<ref name=irfcainternational/><ref name=irfcaintlinks>{{Cite web

After the creation of [[East Pakistan]] (later Bangladesh), many trains that used to run between Assam and Bengal had to be rerouted through the [[Chicken's Neck]]. However as of 2005 there are no passenger links between India and Bangladesh. A meter gauge link exists between Mahisasan (Mohishashon) and Shahbazpur. Another link is between Radhikapur and Birol. These last two links are used occasionally for freight.<ref name=irfcainternational/><ref name=irfcaintlinks/>

There are two links between India and Nepal: Raxaul Jn., Bihar–Sirsiya, Parsa and Jaynagar, Bihar–Khajuri, Dhanusa.<ref name=irfcaintlinks/> The former is broad gauge, while the latter is narrow gauge. A move to link the Indian and Sri Lankan railways never materialised. A ferry service however connects the closest railheads between Indian and Sri Lanka.

==Private railways==
Though the [[Indian Railways]] enjoys a near monopoly in India, a few private railways do exist, left over from the days of the Raj, usually small sections on private estates, etc. There are also some railway lines owned and operated by companies for their own purposes, by plantations, sugar mills, collieries, mines, dams, harbours and ports, etc. The [[Bombay Port Trust]] ran BG railway of its own, as does the [[Madras Port Trust]].<ref name=irfcaprvt>{{Cite web

  |publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club}}</ref> The Calcutta Port Commission Railway is a BG railway. The Vishakhapatnam Port Trust has BG and NG (2 ft 6 in) railways. 

The [[Bhilai Steel Plant]] has a BG railway network.<ref name=irfcaprvt/> The [[Tata Group|Tatas]] (a private concern) operate funicular railways at Bhira and at Bhivpuri Road (as well as the Kamshet–Shirawta Dam railway line which is not a public line). These are not common carriers, so the general public cannot travel using these. The Pipavav Rail Corporation holds a 33-year concession for building and operating a railway line from Pipavav to Surendranagar.<ref name=irfcaprvt/> The Kutch Railway Company, a joint venture of the Gujarat state government and private parties, is involved (along with the Kandla Port Trust and the Gujarat Adani Port) to build a Gandhidham–Palanpur railway line.<ref name=irfcaprvt/> These railway lines are principally used to carry freight and not for passenger traffic. 

Although generally IR has decided the freight tariffs on these lines, recently (February 2005) there have been proposals to allow the operating companies freedom to set freight tariffs and generally run the lines without reference to IR.
