'''Gregory Lloyd Campbell''' (born [[February 15]], [[1953]] in [[Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]]) is a [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] politician, and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] [[member of Parliament|member]] of the [[British parliament]] for [[East Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|East Londonderry]] in [[Northern Ireland]] .

Campbell was raised in [[Londonderry]]'s [[Waterside]] area and was educated at the city's technical college and the [[Magee College|University of Ulster (Magee College site)]]. He joined the DUP in the 1970s and was first elected to [[Londonderry City Council]] in 1981. Campbell briefly led the local DUP members out of the Council in 1984 when the council changed its name to Derry City Council, although he returned to his seat not long after and still holds it.

He was chosen to contest the [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle constituency]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|general election of 1983]]. He contested the same seat again in the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]], although each time he finished second behind [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] leader [[John Hume]].

Given that Foyle had a predominantly [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] population, the increasingly high profile Campbell was transferred to the more winnable East Londonderry seat, where he ran unsuccessfully in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]]. Campbell won the seat at his second attempt in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], gaining a majority of 1,901 over sitting MP [[William Ross (Northern Ireland politician)|William Ross]] of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. He was re-elected in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], this time securing an increased majority of 7,498 over the new UUP candidate [[David McClarty]]. He is also a member of the  [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], topping the Londonderry East poll (from which 6 members are elected) in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly Election, 1998|1998 election]], [[Northern Ireland Assembly Election, 2003|2003]] and again in [[Northern Ireland Assembly Election, 2007|March 2007]]. He was appointed Minister of Regional Development in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] in July 2000.
On June 9 2008, Campbell took over the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, replacing Edwin Poots, following a reshuffle of the DUP's Ministerial team by newly-appointed First Minister Peter Robinson.
