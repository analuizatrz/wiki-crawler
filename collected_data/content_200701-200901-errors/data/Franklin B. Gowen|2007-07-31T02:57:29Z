'''Franklin Benjamin Gowen''' ([[February 9]] [[1836]] &ndash; [[December 13]] [[1889]]) served as president of the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] (commonly referred to as the Reading Railroad) in the 1870s and 1880s.  Today he is mostly identified with the undercover infiltration and subsequent court prosecutions of the [[Molly Maguires]], an alleged [[secret society]] of [[immigration|immigrant]] [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Catholic]] mine workers and saloonkeepers arraigned and tried for multiple acts of violence, including murders and attempted murders of coal mine operators, foremen and workers, and peace officers. Gowen several years earlier had begun to publicly portray this secret society as comprising the core of a miners union he was intent upon decimating.<ref>''Report of the Committee of the Judiciary, General, of the Senate of Pennsylvania, in Relation to the Anthracite Coal Difficulties, with the Accompanying Testimony'', Harrisburg, 1871; pp 14-15, 19, 33</ref>

There are, however, broader aspects of Gowen's presidency that deserve consideration:  

Along the way, Franklin Gowen took the Reading Railroad from being legally prohibited by its corporate charter against owning or operating coal mines, to owning 142 square miles (368 km<sup>2</sup>) of coal lands<ref> Daggett, Stuart, Ph.D., ''Railroad Reorganization'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1908; reprinted New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1967; p. 
77</ref> - with that legal prohibition still in place, but deemed by the state of Pennsylvania to be unenforceable - and running numerous mining operations upon them.  He also played a signal role in the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], resulting in the [[Reading Railroad Massacre]] in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Humphrey, Douglas L., "Reading's Place in The Great Strike & After", ''The Historical Review of Berks County'', Fall 2000.  Also available [http://www.berkshistory.org/articles/railroad.html online].</ref>  Ultimately, during his presidency the Reading Railroad fell twice into bankruptcy.<ref>For detailed case study, see Daggett, Chapter III</ref>  In the wake of the second one, Gowen was finally blocked from further direct involvement in the railroad's affairs when a syndicate led by [[J.P. Morgan]] obtained control of the corporation.

Franklin Benjamin Gowen was born in [[Mount Airy, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Mt. Airy, Pennsylvania]], now part of Philadelphia, the fifth child of Irish [[Protestant]] immigrant and successful [[grocer]], James Gowen and his [[German American]] wife, Mary Miller.<ref>Schlegel, Marvin Wilson, ''Ruler of the Reading: The Life of Franklin B. Gowen'', Harrisburg: Archives Publishing Company of Pennsylvania, 1947, pp 3-4. This book is the most comprehensive biography of Gowen, but its author notes that even by the time of its writing, "the disappearance of Gowen's personal papers has left tantalizing gaps in his portrait," p. vii</ref>  Though his formal education was ended by his father at age 13, when he apprenticed the youth to a [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] merchant; as a young adult Gowen studied [[law]] under a local attorney in [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania]] and, following admission to the bar and joining the local Democratic party, was elected [[District Attorney]] for [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania]] in 1862.  He left that position in 1864 to pursue a private law practice that led him first to represent the Reading Railroad and a few years later to take on its presidency.

Throughout his time with the railroad and afterward, he continued practicing law and trying cases - sometimes as a special prosecutor on behalf of the state of Pennsylvania. Gowen died of a gunshot wound to the head on [[December 13]] [[1889]], at [[James Wormley|Wormley's Hotel]] in [[Washington, DC]].  There still remains some controversy as to whether his death was by [[suicide]] or [[homicide]].<ref>See, for instance, Campbell, Patrick (2002), ''Who killed Franklin Gowen''. ISBN 0-9637701-5-2.</ref>

==Family, education and early law practice==
James Gowen, described later in life as a "hot-tempered, domineering, old Irishman",<sup>[needs citation]</sup> emigrated from Ireland in 1811. He was listed as a "wine merchant" in property records regarding his 1834 purchase of 500 S. 5th Street in Philadelphia for [[United States dollar|US$]]3,000.  The property, which would become the Gowen household and store, consisted of a brick building with retail space on the ground floor and living quarters above it.  He sold the property in 1846.<ref>Fuller, Richard S., ([[June 19]] [[1963]]), ''[http://www.brynmawr.edu/iconog/uphp/t162227/web-content/TransferHistory.pdf 500 S. 5th Street, Chain of Title]'' ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]). Retrieved [[March 5]] [[2005]]</ref>  James Gowen served as director, and later as comptroller, of Philadelphia's public schools; and also as a director of the Bank of Pennsylvania.  He was an ardent Jeffersonian Democrat.<ref>Schlegel, p.2</ref>

Franklin Gowen was the fifth of ten children born to James Gowen and Mary Miller.<ref>Schlegel, pp. 3-4</ref>  Mary, sixteen years James's junior, came from an early-immigrated German family: by tradition, her ancestors had been closely associated with [[Francis Daniel Pastorius]], founder of [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] (now part of Philadelphia), the first permanent German settlement in Pennsylvania.<ref>Schlegel, p. 3</ref>  Prior to Franklin's birth in 1836, the Gowen's moved from central Philadelphia to take up their residence in Mary's family home (James had bought out the interests of other family members) in Mt. Airy, just north of Germantown.

Young Franklin attended [[John Beck's Boys Academy]], a boarding school in [[Lititz, Pennsylvania]], from the ages of nine to thirteen.  At that point, however, his formal schooling was curtailed.  Instead he was apprenticed to a Lancaster dry goods merchant/coal dealer named Thomas Baumgardner, who held an interest in an iron furnace at [[Shamokin, Pennsylvania| Shamokin, Pennsylvania]].  Baumgardner liked and came to trust Franklin so that at age 19, Gowen found himself dispatched as clerk (i.e., bookkeeper) for that iron business.<ref>Schlegel, p. 6, describes Gowen being sent to "manage" the iron furnace.  An earlier source, though, describes a document listing Gowen as "clerk," and also indicates the significance of Baumgardner's Shamokin interests. Bell, Herbert C., ed., ''History of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, etc, etc.'', Chicago, Ill.: Brown, Runk & Co., 1891, pp. 615-616, 800.</ref>  It was during this Shamokin period that Gowen met and courted his future wife, Esther Brisben (sometimes spelled Brisbane) of [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]].

After completing his apprenticeship, Gowen relocated to Pottsville, seat of Schuylkill County and the principal municipality in the southern portion of Pennsylvania's [[Coal Region|coal region]].  There he helped found the Pottsville Literary Society (at one of whose meetings he orated on "The Triumphs of Genius"), and entered into a partnership to operate a coal mine nearby. The mine failed (1859), leaving 23-year-old Gowen US$20,000 in debt.  But undaunted Franklin Gowen – married now – studied law in the office of Benjamin Cumming, a Pottsville attorney.  He was admitted to the bar in 1860.<ref>Schlegel, p. 7, 8</ref>

He established his own practice, at the same time becoming active in the local Democratic party. Gowen served as Schuylkill County's elected D.A. (1862-1864), though in that period, according to his generally sympathetic biographer, he was "doing too well with his private practice to have time to bother with prosecuting criminals."<ref>Schlegel, p. 10</ref>  Others argue that Gowen would have diligently prosecuted numerous cases but for his suspects uniformly being furnished with alibis by fellow criminals, some of whom he brought to justice two decades later as Mollie Maguires.  Whatever Gowen's personal attitude towards his official duties, the climate in Schuylkill County at the time was less than conducive to normal conduct of criminal investigations: First, at that time an elected county sheriff was the principal law enforcement officer.  Second, and much to the point during Gowen's tenure, in July 1863, roughly the midpoint of his D.A. service and of the Civil War, a national conscription act was passed to bolster Union forces. The eruption of anti-draft riots in [[New York Draft Riots|New York]] and other cities threatened to replicate in Schuylkill County as well.  Threats and violence, including murder, occurred in several localities.  Federal troops were deployed to the county to face down these fierce anti-draft feelings and disruptions, and finally conscription was effected under military force.<ref>Wallace, Anthony F.C., ''St. Clair'' (1987), ISBN 0-394-52867-0, pp. 326-328.  For deeper analysis and discussion, see also Palladino, Grace, ''Another Civil War'' (1990), ISBN 0-252-01671-8</ref>  When his own draft number came up that same year, Gowen – by then a father of three - was well-off enough to pay for a substitute, a common practice among those who could afford it.

When Gowen left public office in 1864 in favor of his more lucrative private law practice, among his clients was the Reading Railroad.  His practice prospered, and he was finally able to satisfy the lingering judgments against him from the mine failure and to buy a fashionable home in Pottsville.<ref>Schlegel, p. 10</ref>

In 1865, his two young sons - James and Franklin Benjamin, Jr. - died from illness, leaving his daughter Ellen an only child: she was to have no other brothers or sisters.  Also that spring Franklin's beloved younger brother, George, was killed in the final days of the Civil War.  Col. George Gowen, who had originally moved to Schuylkill County to assist in his brother's mining enterprise, was regarded in Pottsville as a local hero, and the [[Grand Army of the Republic|G.A.R.]] post and local militia company were given his name.<ref>Schlegel, p. 10</ref>

Much legal activity in Pottsville at the time had to do with clearing disputed land titles on behalf of both individuals and companies hoping to reap profits from the increasing anthracite trade.<ref>See, for instance, Hoffman, John N., ''Girard Estate Coal Land in Pennsylvania 1801-1884'', Washington, D.C.:  Smithsonian Institution Press, 1972, p. 15; and Montgomery, Morton L., ''History of Berks County in Pennsylvania'', Philadelphia: Everts, Peck & Richards, 1886, p. 456</ref>  Beyond any work of this kind, Gowen was involved in representing the Reading against personal-injury negligence claims, some of which he argued successfully before the state Supreme Court, exonerating the Reading from liability.

Throughout his career, Franklin Gowen was renowned as an eloquent and persuasive speaker.  A number of his orations were published and sold in pamphlet form.  In an 1866 contract dispute - when Gowen was the Reading's local counsel in Pottsville - he won handily for the Reading, against its rival Pennsylvania Railroad, before the state Supreme Court, "bolster[ing] his points with legal citations, classical quotations, humorous stories, and even a toy train."<ref>Schlegel, p. 11</ref>  Other notable instances included his closing argument as prosecutor in the 1876 murder trial of John Kehoe, vilified at the time as the "King of the Mollie Maguires," in which he portrayed the murders and other crimes attributed to Mollies as being an evil unparalleled in all human history, and as not locally motivated, but driven by orders from other places – Pittsburgh, New York – even other lands – England, Ireland, Scotland;<ref>''Report of the case of the Commonwealth vs. John Kehoe et al. members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, commonly known as "Molly Maguires," etc. etc.'', Pottsville [Pa.] : Miners' Journal Book and Job Rooms, 1876, pp. 184-186</ref> and his three-hour argument in 1881 before a gathering of outraged stockholders of the bankrupt Reading Railroad, inside Philadelphia's [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]], by which he turned open hostility into enthusiastic rounds of applause<ref>Schlegel, 222-224</ref>  One twentieth-century commentator described Gowen's oratory skills thus:

<blockquote>"Even in cold print..., his speeches tend to unsettle the judgment."<ref>Bruce, Robert V., ''1877: Year of Violence'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1959, Reprinted Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 1989), p. 37</ref></blockquote>

By 1867, having impressed the Reading Railroad's management in Philadelphia with his legal exertions on their behalf, including the above mentioned state Supreme Court victory over the Pennsylvania Railroad, he was invited to Philadelphia to head the corporation's legal department.<ref>Schlegel, p. 11</ref>  Leaving Pottsville behind, Gowen sold his home to [[George DeBenneville Keim]], a fellow attorney and close personal friend, who was to figure significantly during Gowen's future presidency of the railroad.

==Running the Reading Railroad==
===Gowen assumes the presidency===
Once established in Philadelphia as chief counsel for the railroad, Gowen further gained the trust of the current president, [[Charles E. Smith (P&R president)|Charles E. Smith]], so that when Smith took a needed ocean voyage for his health in mid 1869, 33-year-old Gowen was put in charge upon Smith's recommendation to the Board of Managers.  When Smith was unable to return for the next board election in January 1870, Gowen was elected president in his own right, a position he would occupy for more than a decade.

The Reading Railroad was a regional carrier only, not a trunk line with its own through connections to Pittsburgh, Chicago and beyond, like the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]], the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]] (B&amp;O) or the [[Erie Railroad|Erie]] railroads.  Rather than a hauler of general freight and passengers, the Reading initially had been formed in the 1830s specifically for the purpose of hauling anthracite coal from Schuylkill County to Philadelphia and points between.  

In the post-Civil War climate of Northern industrial growth and prosperity, the Reading Railroad even prior to Gowen's presidency was involved in dual processes of consolidating control over sub-regional carriers that fed into it, by either acquisition or lease; and of building connections through other lines to Pittsburgh and beyond.  Gowen, as Pottsville counsel and especially as chief counsel of the Reading, was not only aware of, but very close to these endeavors - and secret purchases of Schuylkill County coal lands, in violation of the railroad's corporate charter.<ref> Buggy, Bernard E., “The History of the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company”, ''Publications of the Historical Society of Schuylkill County'', vol. IX, no. 1, Pottsville, Pennsylvania: Historical Society of Schuylkill County, 1989, pp. 54-57</ref>

The core of the Reading's business, however, remained anthracite hauling, and as president Gowen sought to stabilize this core by obtaining control over both ends of the industry that the railroad connected: anthracite production and marketing.

===Controlling Production: Quelling Labor Disputes in the Mines===
His drive to stabilize production began almost as soon as he became president, following a miners' strike action in the Schuylkill coal fields in 1869-70 that resulted in fluctuations of coal traffic on the Reading.  The two sides in the dispute were a loose coalition of mine operators, the Anthracite Board of Trade; and a young union, the [[Workingmen's Benevolent Association of Schuylkill County|Workingmen's Benevolent Association]] (WBA).  Both the miners and the operators were interested in manipulating the price of anthracite at market by controlling the amount produced; but they were in dispute over how fluctuations in real market prices should reflect back upon wages in the mines.  Franklin Gowen was asked by the Board of Trade to mediate.  This resulted in the "Gowen Compromise," a sliding-scale arrangement tying wages to the rise and fall of anthracite's market prices. This scheme was incorporated in July 1870 into the first written contract between miners and operators in the U.S.  Gowen was not a disinterested party in the original dispute, however, his real concerns being to stabilize revenues for the Reading and to do so by introducing his own manipulations of anthracite prices.  

So in the next mining season, when workers and operators entered into fresh disputes over the 1870 contract, he organized a loose (for the time being) combination of anthracite haulers that uniformly hiked freight rates to prohibitive levels, thereby cutting mine operators' revenues so ultimately to force the miners into accepting wages that the combination wanted.

Feelings ran so high against this, that Gowen found himself having to mount a vigorous self-defense before state legislators against what was deemed unprecedented assumption of power by a corporation.  Gowen, both testifying and cross-examining other witnesses, defended himself by taking the offensive. He attacked the WBA generally, and its leader, John Siney, personally, as ignorant, demagogic, wrong-headed in their misunderstandings of the laws of supply and demand; as preventing men from working, forcing the poor to pay high prices for coal, and ruining the iron industry.<ref>Schlegel, pp. 27-29</ref>

It was in these same hearings that Gowen first began to formulate in public discourse his theory that the miners' union had at its core a murderous criminal association:

<blockquote>This organization first came into full fledged existence, in all the [coal] regions, in 1869.  They then formed the Workingmen's Benevolent association, extending throughout the entire coal fields of Pennsylvania.<ref>''Report of the Committee of the Judiciary, General'', p. 14</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>I do not charge this Workingmen's Benevolent association with it, but I say there is an association which votes in secret, at night, that men's lives shall be taken, and that they shall be shot before their wives, murdered in cold blood, for daring to work against the order....  ''I do not blame this association'', but I blame another association for doing it; and it happens that the only men who are shot are the men who dare to disobey the mandates of the Workingmen's Benevolent association.<ref>''Report of the Committee of the Judiciary, General'', p. 19, emphasis in original</ref></blockquote>

This idea, already formed in his mind well before any pointed investigation of such a spectral secret society, Gowen was to expand and propound later in the decade into the image of an international conspiracy as the ultimate target behind the prosecution of coal-region Mollie Maguires.

===Controlling Production: The Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company===
Unlike later-formed anthracite-hauling railroads tied to other portions of the coal region, such as the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad|Lehigh Valley]] and the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western]], whose corporate charters allowed them to also be involved in mining operations, the Reading Railroad's charter prohibited it.  

At this time in the U.S., the granting, regulation, and rescission of corporate charters were managed by the legislative rather than executive branch in most states.  So adding to the allowed pursuits of the Reading by amending its charter was not a matter of simply a board decision and filing of papers.  This legal obstacle to increasing the Reading's control over coal production Gowen snuck around in 1871 by eking out, through political allies, the Pennsylvania legislature's chartering a new corporation, the [[Laurel Run Improvement Company]], whose vaguely set-out purpose was to be involved in coal and iron, and whose shares could be purchased by "any railroad or mining company."<ref>Schlegel, p. 82</ref>  This new company was quickly bought outright by the Reading as a subsidiary and renamed the [[Reading Anthracite Company|Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company]] (the Coal &amp; Iron Co.).  In the meantime, Gowen obtained passage through the legislature of another bill permitting the Reading Railroad to borrow an unlimited amount of money.  Gowen quickly arranged for a US$25 million bond issue and sent agents to buy up Schuylkill County coal land for the Coal &amp; Iron Co.  

During the period from 1871 to 1874, Gowen's Reading Railroad continued to borrow at the rate of US$16 million per year to buy up and develop Schuylkill County coal lands, including numerous existing mining operations. In a number of cases, loans were extended to foundering mine operators to keep them afloat, and Reading money was also put up to build iron furnaces along its rail lines.

====The Twin Shaft Colliery====
In collaboration with his close friend, George deBenneville Keim - who had bought Gowen's Pottsville home in 1864, and was subsequently appointed first president of the Coal &amp; Iron Co. - Gowen's perhaps most crucial business bet was made upon these lands:  development of the Pottsville Twin Shaft Colliery.  This enterprise was based on a theory of mining the Schuylkill Basin coal field promoted by [[Eli Bowen]] in his 1862 book, ''Coal, and the Coal Trade'', where he called for "large capital" to sink two "enormously deep and permanent shafts" to a depth of two thousand feet "before a single pound of coal is allowed to be sent to market."  "[W]ith night and day shifts,” Bowen estimated, the shafts “could be sunk down within two or three years."  Shafts once sunk, the "mining would be carried on night and day, with three eight-hour shifts."  "[A]fterwards you can work it like a machine."<ref>Bowen, Eli, ''Coal, and the Coal Trade'', Philadelphia: T.B. Peterson & Bros.; and Pottsville, Penna.: B. Bannan, 1862, pp. 31, 34, 32.  See also Wallace, 430-432.</ref>  The object of these deep diggings was to reach the famous [[Mammoth Vein]], an undulating seam of high-quality anthracite twenty-five feet thick, projected as providing a virtually inexhaustible supply.  This indeed was the shared vision and plan of Gowen and Keim from the outset of the Coal &amp; Iron Co.<ref>Wallace, pp. 430-431</ref>

Three years into the project, however, the Mammoth Vein was estimated as still 800 feet deeper than digging had reached.  Even after the colliery became operative in 1875, its production never reached even 1/10 of its projected output 750,000 tons per year.  In total, the mine operated only ten years, with a ''cumulative'' output of 275,871 tons.<ref>Wallace, p. 435</ref>

====Financing the Coal &amp; Iron Co.====
The aggressively expansive operations of the Coal &amp; Iron Co., including the Twin Shaft project, required vast outlays of money, and the coal and iron operations were not returning a profit on those outlays.  Rather, the source of Coal &amp; Iron Co. funding was an increasing load of debt owed by the parent railroad:  increased by US$65 million during the first five years of Gowen's presidency - almost twice the railroad's valuation when he took the helm in 1869.  Annual interest on this debt, about US$4 million, was a little less than the average profit of the railroad during those years.  The public face of the Reading Railroad's finances - prospectuses and annual reports - obscured these realities, however.

In 1874, Franklin B. Gowen came under attack again, this time charged before stockholders of accounting sleight of hand – of cloaking continuous losses in the Coal &amp; Iron Co. by infusing into that subsidiary as "capital investment" funds borrowed by the parent railroad, only to mysteriously shuffle large portions of that "investment" back to the parent to cover high dividends paid to railroad shareholders.<ref>Schlegel, p. 56</ref>  In light of those consistent high dividends, though, these accusations were sloughed off, and there was no shareholder revolt to derail him. 

===Controlling the anthracite markets===
The specific destination of coal bound to Philadelphia was that city's [[Port Richmond, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Port Richmond]] area along the Delaware River.  In this complex of rail yards and wharves, coal was unloaded for local marketing or for transshipment by boat to other markets such as New York and Boston.  In the late 1840s and early 1850s, one of Gowen's predecessors as president of the Philadelphia & Reading, [[John Tucker (disambiguation)|John Tucker]], undertook to bolster the railroad's presence and control in Port Richmond with the aim of achieving unquestioned leadership of the coal trade on the Delaware.  The Reading's Port Richmond facilities in 1852 were estimated to comprise 49 acres, including 20 wharves that would allow more than 100 vessels to be loaded simultaneously, and space for storage in slack times of a quarter million tons of coal.<ref>Holton, James L., ''The Reading Railroad: History of a Coal Age Empire'', vol. 1, ISBN 0-9620844-1-7, pp. 129, 131</ref> 

Franklin Gowen endeavored to improve upon the benefits to the Reading Railroad of this shipping terminus / transshipping hub.  In 1871-72, he undertook to undermine business of the competing independent coal dealers in the area - known as "factors" - by setting up a new sales organization under the auspices of the Coal &amp; Iron Co.  Gowen's aim was not only to market the Reading organization's coal, but that of other mine operators whose output the railroad hauled, as well.  

Depicting the factors, who sold typically at commissions of 20 to 25 cents a ton, as sitting "at the water's edge like leeches, sucking the life-blood of a healthy trade," he offered to operators who previously marketed through the factors to sell their coal at only 10 cents per ton.<ref>Schlegel, p. 39</ref>  A number of operators found the proposal immediately agreeable.

But Gowen's next move was not as well received: he offered to consolidate under the Coal &amp; Iron Co. the sales businesses of fifteen factors who also owned their own mining operations.  This proposal rebuffed, Gowen moved to shut down the businesses of independent factors (who did not have their own mines) by denying them continued wharf room at Port Richmond. 

The public controversies stirred up by all these actions lasted into 1873.  Rising above it all, in January of that year Gowen presided over formation of the "coal pool" or "anthracite combination" - including other big coal executives [[Asa Packer]], Thomas Dickson, George Hoyt, and Samuel Sloan - which established "the first industry-wide price-fixing agreement in America."<ref>Schlegel, p.44</ref>  It both set the sales price for coal and allotted the tonnage each member railroad was allowed to haul to market for the coming year.

This anthracite combination fared well, even with the onset of a national depression following the [[Panic of 1873]].  In anticipation of lagging demand for coal in 1874, a long, formal agreement was put in place to enforce regulation of the trade more effectively.

Some coal operators remained outside the coal pool, and for these the Reading Railroad devised a new annoyance: continuing to load coal cars with Coal &amp; Iron Co. anthracite even beyond the Reading's allotted tonnage, then lining these loaded cars on side tracks, thus limiting the availability of empty cars for hauling the other mine operators' output.  The result was haphazard disruption of production and sales for these operators.

Once again, in 1875, Franklin Gowen was called before an investigative committee, for issues raised by his role and actions in another miners' strike (the &quot;Long Strike&quot; - see below), and more substantially for his high-handed maneuverings in the coal trade.  Even the legality of the 1871 charter of the Laurel Run Improvement Company and the Reading Railroad's transformation of that shell into the powerful Coal &amp; Iron Co. were assailed.  But, as so many other times, a court or hearing or board room was Franklin Gowen's special arena; and by his charm, caustic sarcasm, a staggering array of baffling figures, and a key, fallacious [[Reductio ad absurdum|''reductio ad absurdum'']] argument regarding the Laurel Run Improvement Company,<ref>Schlegel, p. 82</ref> the investigating legislators' final report was fully in Gowen's favor.  Also as in other instances, Gowen's orations were broadcast in pamphlet form and in newspaper advertisements.

===The &quot;Long Strike&quot; and the Mollie Maguires===
The "Gowen Compromise" of 1870 did not end strife over wages and other conditions in the coal region. Neither did the imposition of wages through the anthracite combination's exerting control over coal prices at market.  Neither, to be certain, were mining disputes the beginning or end of labor upheavals in America in the 1870s.  

From his first tangles with the Workingmen's Benevolent Association through the end of his life Franklin Gowen was a bitter and outspoken opponent of organized labor, which was still struggling to get on its feet. His long-term campaign to eliminate the WBA dovetailed into a series of murder trials in two counties - Schuylkill and neighboring Carbon - resulting in 19 hangings; these topics will be detailed in this section.  His efforts against the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers - especially a striking local in Reading, Pennsylvania - figured significantly in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877; they will be discussed in the following section.

As noted above, in the 1871 legislative investigation of coal field agitations and the Reading Railroad, Gowen portrayed the WBA as having at its core a murderous, secret association.  In his 1875 testimony before another investigative committee, he characterized this same core of the union as "Communists."<ref>Schlegel, p. 84.  See Wikipedia articles on the [[Paris Commune]] and [[International Workingmen's Association]] to better understand the contemporary connotations of this charge.</ref>

In September 1873, the failure of Jay Cooke & Co. precipitated first the Panic of 1873 and in its wake the worst U.S. financial depression up to that time, which resonated with the concurrent transatlantic [[Long Depression]].  Initially, northeastern U.S. anthracite markets were not badly affected, largely due to controls put in place by Gowen's coal pool. In 1874, in addition to shoring up this coal pool's internal checks to make sure all members played by the rules, Gowen also organized Schuylkill County's independent coal operators into the Schuylkill Coal Exchange.  By autumn 1874 it was common knowledge that these operators (including the Coal &amp; Iron Co.) were intent upon precipitating a ruinous miners' strike by which to destroy the WBA (by this time renamed the Miners and Laborers Benevolent Association, or M&amp;LBA).<ref>Schlegel, pp. 63-65.</ref>  Such a strike was indeed brought about by severe slashes in wages offered to miners (20% cut) and mine laborers (10% cut).  Known as the &quot;Long Strike&quot;, the work stoppage lasted through June 1875, ending in the collapse of the union.

Meanwhile, in October 1873, Gowen met in Philadelphia with [[Allan Pinkerton]].  Pinkerton's published account of the meeting depicts Gowen laying out in some detail the existence, background and nature of a criminal secret society called Mollie Maguires, transplanted from Ireland to the coal region of Pennsylvania.<ref>Schlegel, pp. 87-88, citing Allan Pinkerton, ''The Molly Maguires and the Detectives'' (New York, 1877), pp. 13-15</ref>

[[Image:James McParland.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[James McParland]] who infiltrated the [[Molly Maguires]] for the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton Agency]].]]Pinkerton's [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|detective agency]] was already an established presence in the coal fields, having been active supervising the [[Coal and Iron Police]], a private police force authorized by the state of Pennsylvania in 1865, paid for by railroad, mining and iron interests.  Pinkerton was glad to take on additional work for the Reading Railroad.  

Most famously, one of his detectives, [[James McParland]], infiltrated what he testified was the Mollies' innermost circle and provided, as a surprise witness, what proved to be damning evidence in several murder trials.

A series of murders July and September 1875, following the breakdown of the WBA and its Long Strike, led to several arrests over the next year of men identified as Mollie Maguires.  Arrests, trials, convictions and hangings of Mollie Maguires occurred in the adjoining counties of Schuylkill and Carbon, in 1876-1878.  Irish Catholics were excluded from juries.  Gowen himself acted as special prosecutor in more than one trial in Schuylkill, most notably in 1876 at that of [[John Kehoe|John "Black Jack" Kehoe]], whom he characterized in his summation as "chief conspirator, murderer, and villain" and "with having made money by his traffic in the souls of his fellow-men."  In this same summation he speculated that had detective McParland had one more year to complete his undercover investigation, the jury "would have had the pleasure ... of hanging some men who are not citizens of Schuylkill county," such as "the head of this order at Pittsburg, and ... its head in New York"; and suggested further that the ultimate source and directive force behind the secret order would have been found in England, Ireland and Scotland.<ref>''Report of the Case of the Commonwealth vs. John Kehoe, et al.'', Pottsville, 1876, pp. 184, 186</ref>  Kehoe was initially tried and convicted of conspiracy, and subsequently of a murder that had occurred during Gowen's term as District Attorney - despite another man's signed admission of guilt for the murder. Kehoe was posthumously pardoned by Pennsylvania's governor in 1979.

Controversial at the time, circumstances and events surrounding both the Long Strike and the Mollie Maguire prosecutions and hangings have grown even more so with the passage of time.  Gowen's multi-faceted role in particular - from his 1871 and 1875 testimonies positing a Mollie-like criminal enterprise at the heart of the WBA, which he also rhetorically linked to Communism; to the coincidental timing of the hopeless Long Strike precipitated by the Schuylkill Coal Exchange that Gowen had organized, on one hand, and his bankrolling the undercover anti-Mollie machinations, on the other; plus partially substantiated claims that McParland or other Pinkertons essentially on the Reading Railroad payroll instigated both Mollie-like activities and anti-Mollie vigilantism<ref>See, for instance, Miller, Donald L., and Richard E. Sharpless, ''The Kingdom of Coal:  Work, Enterprise and Ethnic Communities in the Mine Fields'', 1985; and Campbell, Patrick, ''A Molly Maguire Story'', 1992.</ref> - has eluded historical consensus.

===The Great Strike of 1877===
During Franklin Gowen's presidency, the Reading Railroad was one of the richest corporations in the world - running not only trains, but an empire of coal mines, of canals and oceangoing vessels; and even trying (unsuccessfully) a subsidiary rail venture in Brazil.<ref>Holton, pp. 202-203</ref> Though its corporate management resided in Philadelphia, the motive power propelling the railroad emanated from Reading, roughly 60 miles northwest of the larger city, where a 36-acre engineering/production shop complex sat adjacent to the downtown.

Contentions between the Reading and laborers embroiled not only miners in the Coal & Iron division, but engineers and other workers in the Railroad division as well. Both the Reading Railroad and its namesake city were fertile grounds for early unionization. In particular, the city of Reading was throughout the 1870s home to a very motivated local of the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers]] (the BLE).

Gowen's crushing of the WBA, coupled with his widely hailed unraveling of the Mollie Maguires, heartened railroad capitalists nationwide. His triumphs refreshed their confidence that unionism could be squashed altogether. 

This impression of Gowen's prowess against unions was reinforced by his moves to quell a BLE strike in Reading in April 1877. Having learned from spies of a strike about to happen, Gowen issued an ultimatum: leave the union, or be fired. Nearly 80 per cent of the railroad's engineers walked off the job. Bosses and other non-union employees were pressed into service to run the trains until "temporary" replacements (i.e., [[Strikebreaker|strikebreakers]]) could be hired on. The ''New York Times'' hailed the destruction of the "dictatorial" BLE and encouraged "employers generally" to imitate Gowen's anti-union stance.<ref> Bruce, Robert V., ''1877: Year of Violence'', 1959. [Reprinted 1989.  ISBN 0-929587-05-7], pp. 40-42</ref> Having apparently dealt a crushing blow to the BLE, Gowen sailed to Europe for a fresh round of fundraising and a vacation.

Throughout the spring of 1877, heads of the four major U.S. trunk lines – the B&amp;O, the New York Central, the Erie and the Pennsylvania – held meetings to determine how, by working together, they could all - in spite of the raging national depression - "earn more and … spend less." The initial fruits of these meetings was a freight pooling arrangement along lines similar to Gowen's anthracite combination, to increase revenues by reducing competition. They also determined that, after Gowen's defeating the BLE, a reduction in rail workers' wages was timely.<ref>Bruce, p. 41</ref> The Pennsylvania was the first of the four to act, announcing an across-the-board wage cut of 10 per cent, effective June 1, 1877. Cuts on other roads – not just the four trunk lines – followed, affecting rail workers nationwide.

The B&amp;O's 10 per cent cut precipitated, in July 1877, a work stoppage in Martinsburg, West Virginia, which multiplied with telegraphic speed into the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]]. The Great Strike flashed from coast to coast; workers on railroad after railroad, in city after city, struck as well, forcing a halt to all rail activity in or through numerous locales, and in some places triggering general non-railroad work stoppages. Interstate commerce was paralyzed for weeks. As the Strike spread, destructive and deadly violence erupted in some major cities – Baltimore; Pittsburgh, Reading and Scranton, Pennsylvania; Buffalo, Chicago, San Francisco.

Almost immediately upon his return from Europe, on the very day the Great Strike broke out, Franklin Gowen instituted massive layoffs of brakemen across the railroad, in effect both sanctioning and reinforcing the other railroads' moves while he was gone.

In Reading, back in April and May, striking BLE engineers had been quickly displaced by strikebreakers and then blacklisted - but the strikebreakers, as well as other workers, were not paid by the cash-strapped Reading Railroad from May through mid-July. While the Great Strike gathered momentum, Gowen found the money to pay back wages in Reading. Local outrage at Gowen and the Reading was intensified as newly laid-off brakemen swelled the ranks of unemployed railroad men and strikebreakers saw their wages as a transparent effort to buy loyalty.

Ultimately, within a month of the first Mollie Maguire hangings (June 20, 1877), the ongoing BLE strike in Reading, which Gowen believed he had broken just as he had the WBA's strike in 1875, gained fresh momentum from the unfolding Great Strike; tensions in the city escalated until, on July 23, ten citizens were killed by the Pennsylvania state militia in the [[Reading Railroad Massacre]]. Federal troops were dispatched to Reading to restore order. Following the Massacre, in October 1877 Gowen personally prosecuted men whom Pinkerton spies had pinpointed as the local BLE ringleaders, but they were acquitted. [[Image: Uriah-stephens-circa-1900.gif|thumb|right|180px|Uriah S. Stephens, founder of the Knights of Labor]]

Three months later, in January 1878, Reading was the site of the first national convention of the [[Knights of Labor]], which grew into one of the important U.S. labor organizations of the nineteenth century. As with many early labor organizations, its membership rolls and meetings were secret, to help avoid infiltration and blacklisting. The Knights creed and organization crossed occupational lines, attempting to become a sort of "union of unions." As such, after the collapse of the WBA/M&amp;LBA, miners in the anthracite region formed locals of the Knights of Labor. In one incident, when Coal &amp; Iron Co. workers struck for back pay, Gowen once again raised the issue of terrorism.  Seeking to avert the spread of the strike, he sent an open letter to the ''Miner's Journal'' newspaper in Pottsville exposing the names of the officers and membership of the Knights assemblies.  He also implied that there was a "gang" within the union, similar to the Mollies, whose task was to sabotage coal company property.  The Knights fought back by challenging the Schuylkill County authorities to arrest the alleged terrorists, but since Gowen's charges were unsubstantiated, the matter went no further.<ref>Miller and Sharpless, p. 215, citing Harold Aurand, ''From the Molly Maguires to the United Mine Workers'', pp. 115-6</ref>

===Bankruptcies and ouster from the Reading===
====The Reading Railroad's first bankruptcy====
The United States was roiled repeatedly throughout the nineteenth century by financial panics  
and resultant economic recessions, each with transatlantic dimensions.<ref>See Wikipedia  
articles: [[Panic of 1819]], [[Panic of 1825]], [[Panic of 1837]], [[Panic of 1847]], [Panic of 
1873]], [[Panic of 1884]], [[Panic of 1890]], [[Panic of 1893]].</ref> The [[Panic of 1837]]  
was pivotal for the Reading Railroad. After the road's optimistic startup on  
a foundation of American capital in 1834, because it was "constructed without financial  
stint... the income from the company's operations had to be maintained at an unusually high  
level just to stay in the black."<ref>Holton, pp. 120-21</ref> During the American economic  
contraction following the 1837 panic, management turned in desperation to London for fresh  
capital and credit. The resulting influx of badly needed cash made the Reading the first  
American railroad to come under direct English influence as to its management.<ref>Adler,  
Dorothy R., ''British Investment in American Railways, 1834-1898'', 1970, ISBN 0-8139031-1-4, p. 11</ref> From well prior to Gowen's presidency, and continuing through it until the Reading Railroad came fully under J.P. Morgan's sway, these London interests exerted great influence.

The Reading better weathered the panics of 1847 and 1857, but under Franklin Gowen's management and expansionist programs, the Panic of 1873 and its follow-on depression were once again of instrumental importance. The railroad fell deeper and deeper into debt until, finally, in May 1880, the well was dry: the Reading had gone bankrupt.

Despite the harsh realities of the depression that ran from late 1873 into 1879, it was significant misjudgments on Gowen's part that led to the Reading Railroad's collapse in 1880.
His determination to dominate, through the Reading Railroad, the overall supply/demand dynamic of anthracite was hemmed in by insurmountable bounds from the outset. 

The mining theory behind the ultimately wasteful development of the Pottsville Twin Shaft operation was not well grounded in the geologic science even of that time. But that theory alone did not make up Gowen's rationale for the massive expenditures of the Coal &amp; Iron Co. He believed that the Schuylkill Valley - which from colonial times until the Civil War had been the center of American iron-making - would, because of the importance of [[anthracite iron]], continue to hold that preeminent position indefinitely. He stated this belief forthrightly in the Reading Railroad annual report for 1870<ref>Schlegel, p. 54</ref>; but already the use of lower-cost [[coke]] made from more widely available [[bituminous coal]], together with expanding markets in the Midwest and West, was driving the center of the iron industry (and soon, steelmaking) to Pittsburgh. Already the importance of anthracite as an indispensable industrial fuel was slipping.

Even Gowen's anthracite combination, successful at maintaining profitable market prices even as depression set in, was not able to continue long in unity. Internecine squabbles and continued deteriorating business conditions all around undermined the effectiveness of this pooling effort, and coal prices and revenues fluctuated year by year. The combination unraveled in August 1876, with Gowen angrily denouncing erstwhile coal pool member Asa Packer by name. Meanwhile, earlier in the year the Coal &amp; Iron Company's retail marketing operation at Port Richmond was transferred to an independent concern.<ref>Schlegel, pp. 153-155</ref> As the Philadelphia coal market continued to decline, Schuylkill County mine operators sent Thomas Baumgardner, who had given Franklin Gowen his first introduction to the coal and iron businesses during his apprenticeship, as part of a committee to get a read on Gowen's intentions. Still out of sorts over the larger anthracite combination's falling apart, Gowen would not commit to any new price-fixing arrangement.<ref>Schlegel, p. 155</ref>

Finally, Gowen did not well discern the special nature of the Reading, as compared to other railroads of the time, in terms of its underlying capitalization. As noted above, the road was "constructed without financial stint"; specifically, it was laid out at a cost per mile that far exceeded that of other lines in the coal region, or even of such trunk lines as the B&amp;O and Erie.<ref>Holton, p. 16, gives a figure of $180,000/mile; Dagget give $193,417/mile for the Reading (p. 75), $41,237 for the B&amp;O (p. 1), and $43,961 for the Erie (p. 34); and Childs, C.G., ed., ''Pennsylvania the Pioneer in Internal Improvements'', Philadelphia, 1847, indicates Schuylkill and Lehigh coal region carriers, exclusive of the Reading, as ranging from $6,667 to $67,500/mile, but puts the Reading at $118,280/mile. Even allowing for differences in reporting periods for these figures, those for the Reading Railroad are consistently eye-popping.</ref> Carrying costs for this capitalization was the issue that first drove the Reading into the arms of English lenders and investors. Somewhat a relief on both sides of the Atlantic, then, was the period 1861-1867, when the railroad managed to cut its funded debt roughly in half - from $11,819,400 to $5,902,300.<ref>Poor, Henry V., ''Manual of the Railroads of the United States, for 1868-69'', New York, 1868, pp. 258-64</ref>

This was the fiscally sound, but still burdened, Reading Railroad whose presidency Gowen assumed in 1869. Instead of gleaning insight from the railroad's successful struggle to bring its overhead under control, he turned the enterprise in the following decade into a mysteriously accounted borrowing machine. In 1874, a former Gowen friend turned enemy by Gowen's organization of the anthracite industry, accused Gowen in print of dishonest and misleading financial representations in the Reading's annual report and its prospectuses.<ref>Schlegel, p. 56, citing Borda, Eugene, ''A Few Remarks on the Last Report of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company'', Philadelphia, 1874</ref> Though Gowen was able to easily slough off such accusation at that time, it was renewed more powerfully in 1876 by Charles E. Smith - Gowen's direct predecessor as president, who had recommended the young man for the position in his absence. Even following Gowen's election to the post in his own right, Smith had remained on the corporation's Board of Managers. After hearing from Gowen of a US$7 million floating debt that had never been discussed in any board meetings, Smith inspected the unpublished books of the subsidiary Coal &amp; Iron Co., which issued no annual report of its own. He found that the parent corporation's floating debt was being transferred to the subsidiary before the parent's fiscal year end in November, to avoid appearing in year-end statements; only to be shifted back to the parent prior to the subsidiary's own fiscal year end in December, thus effectively masking the joint enterprise's precarious condition overall. Smith raised the issue to the Reading's principal source of funds, the [[McCalmont Brothers]] investment banking firm in London, seeking Gowen's ouster, but was rebuffed. Though Gowen remained as president, and Smith resigned from the board, the incident forced Gowen's 1876 annual report to approximate frankness. It indicated the corporation's funded debt as US$65 million, resulting in US$5.5 million annually in carrying charges, compared to just over US$3 million in earnings for the railroad and a US$600,000 loss for the Coal &amp; Iron Co.<ref>Schlegel, pp. 186-189</ref>

From that time, through fresh sanguine predictions for improvements in the business climate and the Reading's overall performance, which allowed him to borrow more funds on a less grand sclae and to get the McCalmonts to defer interest payments due; and maneuverings such as periodically paying workers in scrip - essentially promissory notes - instead of cash, Franklin Gowen continued to run the Reading. In early 1880, employees were paid in cash for the first time in sixteen months.<ref>Holton, p. 218</ref> On May 21, 1880, however, "the impoverished and embarrassed condition of the company's finances" – carrying charges had reached US$7 million per year, while the most sanguine expectations of income didn't surpass US$4 million – forced the Reading Railroad, one of the largest corporations of the time, to suspend payment on debts.<ref>Daggett, p. 81; Holton, p. 221</ref> This was the first bankruptcy of the Reading under Gowen's presidency.

==Life after the railroad==
Gowen left the Reading in 1883 and returned to his law practice.  Shortly before his death, many of Gowen's friends and associates noticed a change in his overall mood.  They remarked upon his more somber demeanor and noted that for a trip home to Philadelphia, he had boarded the wrong train.  Gowen wrote to his insurance agent on [[December 9]] [[1889]], to ask if he could cash in his $90,000 life insurance policy.  Three days later, after he had arrived in [[Washington, DC]], to argue a case before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], Gowen purchased a revolver at a hardware store on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Franklin Gowen died of a gunshot wound on Friday, [[December 13]] [[1889]], at Wormly's Hotel in [[Washington, DC]].  Some have speculated that his death was the result of action by the Molly Maguires, while others have said that he committed suicide as a result of the guilt he felt for framing union members.  The coroner ruled the death a suicide, but like other famous deaths, questions remain and are still debated to this day. The owner of Wolford's Hardware Store on Pennsylvania Avenue came forward to identify Gowen as the man who had bought the pistol the day before. Conspiracy theories about assassins and impersonations were put aside when the Gowen family reported that he had been "acting queerly for some time and that there was a strain of hereditary insanity in his family."<Ref>Jame D. Horan and Howard Swiggett, The Pinkerton Story, 1951, page 158–159.</Ref> 

==Conclusion==
[Under construction]

<blockquote>"Simply put, [Gowen] turn[ed] the company from one of economic conservatism to daring adventurism.  Every aspect of the [Reading Railroad]'s existence was to be enervated and agitated and sometimes turned topsy-turvy during the Gowen years of the 1870s and 1880s."<ref> Holton, p171</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The few scraps of letters and memoranda ''from'' Gowen that shed some light on this seem to indicate that he was impatient, even bored, when details of real railroading practices came to his attention.  It was corporate power and financial finagling that interested this complex man. . . . Gowen's financial rewards were meager, and while he did attain considerable public attention and the trappings of his office, this dynamic leader ultimately was consumed by his final failure and his career ended in tragedy."<ref>Holton, pp171-172 (emphasis in original text)</ref></blockquote>
