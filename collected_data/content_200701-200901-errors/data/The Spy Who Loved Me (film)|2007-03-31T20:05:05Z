'''''The Spy Who Loved Me''''' is the tenth film in the [[EON Productions]] [[James Bond]] series and the third to star [[Roger Moore]] as [[United Kingdom|British]] Secret Service agent 007, Commander James Bond. Released in [[1977 in film|1977]], it is the second Bond film to be directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]]. Gilbert previously directed ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967) and would later direct ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979).

''The Spy Who Loved Me'' marks the first film in the EON Productions series not to be produced by [[Harry Saltzman]], who had previously sold his shares of EON Productions to [[United Artists]] in 1975 following the release of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''. It is also the first wholly original Bond film to be written, as [[Ian Fleming]] only gave permission for the title to be used. The film was subsequently novelised by [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]].

==Production==
''The Spy Who Loved Me'' in many ways was a make or break film for the Bond franchise and was plagued since its conception by many problems. The first was the departure of Bond producer [[Harry Saltzman]], who was forced to sell his half of the Bond film franchise due to financial difficulties. A second problem was the issue of finding a director. The producers approached [[Steven Spielberg]] who was in post-production of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' to direct though decided to wait to see 'how the fish picture turns out'. The first director attached to the film was [[Guy Hamilton]], who directed the previous three Bond films as well as ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', but left after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film, ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. EON Productions would later turn to [[Lewis Gilbert]] who had directed the similar Bond film, ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.
[[Image:Stromberg.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Curd Jurgens]] as [[Karl Stromberg]]]]
With a director finally secured, the next hurdle to be overcome was finishing the script, which had gone through several rewrites by numerous writers. Additionally, the initial villain of the film was [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]. However, [[Kevin McClory]], who owns the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', forced an [[injunction]] on EON Productions delaying the film further. The villain would later be changed from Blofeld to [[Karl Stromberg]] so that the injunction could be lifted. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] was later brought in by Lewis Gilbert to complete the script. Although Fleming had requested no elements from his original book be used, the novel features a thug named Sol Horror who is described as having steel capped teeth. This character would be the basis for [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]], although having steel capped teeth is where the similarity between Horror and Jaws ends.

Regardless of all the problems throughout production of the film, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was a financial and box office success, raking in $185,400,000 worldwide on a production budget of $14 million [[United States dollar|USD]]. At the time it was the highest grossing Bond film.

==Plot summary==
[[Ballistic Missile Submarine|Ballistic missile submarines]] from the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fleet are stolen by the [[List of James Bond villains|villain]], [[Karl Stromberg]], in an attempt to launch their [[nuclear weapons]] at targets around the globe. James Bond teams up with Major [[Anya Amasova]] (a.k.a. Agent Triple X), a dedicated agent from the Soviet Union, to find out what happened and prevent a possible [[World War III]].
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:Pyramids of Egypt1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One scene sees Bond encountering Jaws around the pyramids]]
[[Image:MooreSpy.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Munro, Moore, Bach: ''The Spy Who Loved Me'']]
The film begins in [[Austria]], where Bond escapes an ambush by Soviet agents, killing one of them in a [[Alpine skiing|downhill ski]] race that concludes in an all-time iconic Bond film moment: when Bond skis off a vast cliff and falls…  only to open a [[Union Jack]] [[parachute]] (the film was released in [[Great Britain]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]] year). On reporting back to base, Bond learns that someone is trying to sell the plans of a highly advanced [[submarine]] tracking system to the highest bidder. Bond then travels to [[Egypt]], where he is supposed to contact the prospective seller near the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]. Here he first encounters the beautiful Major Anya Amasova, who becomes a rival in his search for the plans, and later a partner in a somewhat uneasy truce (supported by their respective superiors) when they realise that the person behind the theft of the plans (Karl Stromberg, who is a [[shipping]] tycoon) is also responsible for the disappearance of the submarines.

The duo decides to travel to Stromberg's base in [[Sardinia]]. In a [[train]] on the way there, Bond saves Amasova's life as she is attacked by [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]]. Shortly after their arrival in Sardinia, Amasova learns about Bond's killing of the Soviet agent in Austria, who the audience already knows was her lover. She tells Bond she will complete the mission with him, but vows that after she has fulfilled her duty, she will kill 007 in revenge. Posing as a [[oceanography|marine biologist]] and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover that he has a mysterious new [[supertanker]], the ''Liparus''. After they leave the base, Jaws and others, including a helicopter pilot called Naomi ([[Caroline Munro]]), attempt repeatedly to kill them, but all attempts fails due to Bond's driving skills and fact that his car – a [[Lotus Esprit]] from [[Q Branch]] – can convert into a [[submarine]]. With this, they examine Stromberg's Atlantis base and confirm that he is operating the tracking system. The [[United States Navy]] submarine in which they then attempt to pursue the ''Liparus'' is, like the other subs, captured by the modified supertanker, and Stromberg begins to set his plan in motion. The plan is to launch nuclear missiles from the submarines he captured, the targets being Moscow and New York City. This will start World War III, which Stromberg will wait out in his underwater city, establishing a new civilisation. However, a huge battle within the ''Liparus'' between its crew and those captured from the subs culminates in escape and a race to destroy Atlantis. Bond is able to get the British and Soviet submarines to destroy each other first, saving Moscow and New York, but then insists on a final confrontation with Stromberg and the rescue of Amasova, after whom the villain is now lusting; Bond shoots Stromberg and, after a final fight with Jaws, the two spies depart his base just before it is destroyed. As they await rescue in a small [[escape pod]], Bond finds a bottle of champagne and suggests they have a drink. Amasova reminds Bond that she has vowed to kill him and draws her gun, but instead of shooting him, she smiles when the top pops off the champagne bottle, making a for-once visibly shaken Bond jump. He asks for a last request, which Amasova then grants: he suggests they get out of their wet clothes. Amasova finally forgives him and the two embrace passionately. Their respective bosses are subsequently horrified to find them in a compromising position…

"Just trying to keep the British end up Sir." Bond quips before pulling the shade.

The film is best known for Bond's Lotus Esprit submarine/car and the introduction of [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]], a giant and seemingly indestructible [[assassin]] with steel teeth. Jaws, played by [[Richard Kiel]], does not speak and is the only henchman of the James Bond villains privileged to appear in more than one film. He later appeared in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (in which he has one line). Previously, Kiel had played a similar character in the action comedy ''[[Silver Streak (1976 film)|Silver Streak]]'' starring [[Gene Wilder]] and [[Richard Pryor]].

==Cast & characters==

[[Robert Brown (actor)|Robert Brown]] also has a smaller role in ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' as Admiral Hargreaves. Brown would go on to replace Bernard Lee as M in ''[[Octopussy]]''. It has never been established as to whether Brown was supposed to be still playing Lee's character, a promoted Hargreaves, or someone else.

[[Walter Gotell]] makes his first appearance as General Gogol of the KGB. Gogol would appear in all future Roger Moore Bond films and would make his final appearance in [[Timothy Dalton]]'s ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. While this was his first appearance as Gogol, this is Gotell's second appearance in a James Bond film. His first was in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' where he played the villain Morzeny.

[[Shane Rimmer]] continues his tradition of making an appearance in a James Bond film, this time starring as Commander Carter of the USS ''Wayne'', the submarine that brought Bond inside the supertanker, as well as helped lead the resistance against Stromberg.

[[Jeremy Bulloch]] also makes an appearance as a British sailor who fights back against Stromberg's forces. He would appear in later Bond movies as Q's assistant, Smithers. He is most well know for wearing the [[Boba Fett]] costume (although his voice was overdubbed in post-production) in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.

{{main|James Bond music}}
The title song, "[[Nobody Does it Better]]" was performed by [[Carly Simon]] and was the first theme song to be titled differently than the name of the movie, although the phrase "the spy who loved me" is in the lyrics. The song became a hit that is still popular today and has been featured in numerous movies including the recently released ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]), ''[[Little Black Book]]'' ([[2004 in film|2004]]), ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' and ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (movie)|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'' (2004). In 2004, the song was honoured by the [[American Film Institute]] as the 67th greatest song as part of their [[100 Years Series]].

The soundtrack to the movie was composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]], who filled in for veteran [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] due to his being unavailable for work in the [[United Kingdom]] due to tax reasons. The soundtrack, in comparison with other Bond films of the time, is more [[disco]]-oriented and included a new disco rendition of the [[James Bond music#The James Bond Theme|James Bond Theme]] entitled "Bond 77".

An element of the Barry style remains in the suspenseful film sequence in which Bond and Amasova try to track down Jaws at an antiquated site in Egypt. The accompanying Hamlisch music echoes Barry's "Stalking," from the pre-credit fantasy sequence of ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'', featuring Bond ([[Sean Connery]]) and villain Red Grant ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]).

===Track listing===
#"Nobody Does It Better"  — Carly Simon
#"Bond 77" (James Bond Theme)
#"Ride To Atlantis"
#"Mojave Club"
#"Nobody Does It Better" (Instrumental)
#"Anya"
#"The Tanker"
#"The Pyramids"
#"Eastern Lights"
#"Conclusion"
#"End Titles"-Nobody Does It Better — Carly Simon

In addition, Hamlisch incorporates into his score several pieces of classical music. As Stromberg feeds his duplicitous secretary ([[Marilyn Galsworthy]]) to a shark, the villain plays [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s "[[Air on the G String]]" — famous for accompanying the disaster-prone characters in TV adverts for Hamlet cigars. He then plays the opening string section of the second movement, Andante, of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s Piano Concerto No. 21 "Elvira Madigan" as Atlantis rises from the sea. Nocturne No. 8 in D-Flat, Op. 27 No. 2 by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] crops up later, as reportedly does an excerpt from [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]' The Aquarium from The Carnival of the Animals. Finally, Hamlisch cheekily segues his score into an excerpt from [[Maurice Jarre]]'s ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' score when Bond and Anya Amasova are wandering through the desert; according to a documentary on the DVD, this idea was originally a joke by one of the film editors who played the music over the [[dailies]] of the scene. (The gag started a trend, with subsequent Bond films also including excerpts from other famous film themes.)

==Vehicles & gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
[[Image:Lotus_spy.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Lotus Esprit]] Wet Nelly, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'']]
*[[Lotus Esprit]] — Including all of the usual Q refinements, this car was equipped with [[surface to air missile]]s. The main feature of the car however was the ability to transform into a submarine. Once transformed it could unleash depth charges and smoke screens. The car was nicknamed ''Wet Nellie'', a reference to the autogyro provided by Q for Bond's use in ''You Only Live Twice''. Within the second unit production team, it was also known as ''Margie Nixon''. There were three vehicles used for the special effect — a waterproofed Esprit able to drive into the water without excessive damage to engine or occupants (for scenes driving onto the beach, and escaping from the helicopter by diving into the water, though there is contention that the scene in question was filmed by sacrificing an Esprit for the shot); a second vehicle which could only transform from car to submarine — technical critics will see that the vehicle was extremely uni-functional, despite being very well built; and ''Margie Nixon'', the [[Wet_sub|wet submarine]] whose body was constructed from an Esprit donor car.
*[[Wetbike]] — a [[hydrofoil]] "water motorcycle" used by Bond to travel from the U.S. Submarine to Stromberg's Atlantis to save Triple X.  Built by a subsidiary of [[Minnesota]]-based Arctic Enterprises.
*XXX's Cigarette — The cigarette used by Triple X contained knock-out powder.
*[[Seiko]] Quartz watch — Basically working like a pager, it had a built-in telex that allowed MI6 to send important messages to Bond, printing them out like a miniature [[teletype]]. (It actually looked more like a [[label-maker]] tape.)
*[[Ski pole]] gun — Was used to fire a projectile at pursuers. Bond uses it to kill Triple X's lover while escaping from him in the pre-credits sequence.
*[[Microfilm]] viewer disguised as a cigarette case and lighter.  Bond uses it to examine the microfilm (in the film - the microfilm container has the [[Minolta]] logo) of the submarine tracking system.

==Trivia==

* At the end of the film, the credits announce that the next Bond film will be ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''. Ultimately, however, the producers chose instead to adapt ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' next in order to cash in on the sci-fi/fantasy craze sparked by the success of ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Superman (movie)|Superman]]''.
* This is the second film in the history of the Bond series (as of 2004) in which M refers to Bond by his first name, rather than simply 007 or Bond (the first time was at his wedding in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''). We also hear M's real first name (Miles) for the first time on film. In addition, Q is referred to by his real name (Major Boothroyd) for the first time since ''[[Diamonds Are Forever]]''. Miss Moneypenny is still left without a first name.
* Although the movie received a PG rating, pictures of nude women are visible. At the beginning of the movie in the submarine, when the sailor is walking out of the bunks, to the left of the screen are pictures hanging on the wall. There is also a brief silhouette of Anya showering in the captain's shower in which her [[nipples]] and [[sex organs]] are visible.  This is not the first time there was nudity in a Bond film.  There are several instances in movies like [[Diamonds are Forever]], [[The Man With the Golden Gun]], [[The Living Daylights]], and [[Tomorrow Never Dies]] where female breasts and butts are visible, but it would take an expert with a pause and zoom button on a DVD remote to find. 
*The hull number of the American submarine portrayed, 593, was in real life the hull number of the ill-fated [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS ''Thresher'']] which sank in 1963.
* Bond's killing of Naomi (via a missile from his Lotus sub) marks the first time 007 clearly and deliberately kills a woman in the film series (see also [[Fiona Volpe]] in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''), and it would be the last time until his fateful final encounter with [[Elektra King]] in ''[[The World is Not Enough]]''.
* The 007 Soundstage at [[Pinewood Studios]], for many years the largest in the world, was specially constructed for this film.
*Prior to the film's release, Barbara Bach posed nude for the [[List of men's magazines|men's magazine]] ''[[Playboy]]''.
* [[Michael Billington (actor)|Michael Billington]], who plays Anya's ill-fated lover, Sergei, was considered a candidate for the role of Bond on several occasions in the 1970s and 1980s. He is best known for his role as Paul Foster in the science fiction series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]''.
* Demand for Lotus Esprits surged after the film was released. Many new customers were put on a three-year waiting list.
* [[Stanley Kubrick]] provided uncredited assistance in supervising the lighting of the tanker set due to cinematographer [[Claude Renoir]]'s failing eyesight.
* Although this isn't the first Bond film to relocate M's office to an exotic location as a branch office (''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' was the first), it is the first to have Q-Branch likewise relocated with a full array of weapons and testing personnel catering to the particular region of the world. Future similar relocations would occur in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' and ''[[Octopussy]]''. (Q, on his own, first joined Bond in the field in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.)
* [[Valerie Leon]] has two brief scenes with Moore, as the saucy Sardinian hotel receptionist. She also appears in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' opposite [[Sean Connery]]'s James Bond.
* Some viewers see this as an underwater version of ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' owing to how the capture of U.S. and Russian submarines by a sub-eater parallels the capture of U.S. and Soviet spacecraft by Blofeld's spacecraft-eater, and numerous similarities in the sub-eater battle sequence (e.g. the section where Bond hijacks the monorail, the closing of the shutters and more).
* The parachute ski jump in the pre-credits sequence was performed by [[Rick Sylvester]] at [[Mount Asgard]], [[Baffin Island]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Canada]].  It was filmed by series editor and second-unit director [[John Glen]].  The success of the footage was instrumental in Glen's succession to the post of in-house director for the final three Moore Bond movies, and the two [[Timothy Dalton]] pictures, as Glen recounts in his [[autobiography]] {{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The iconic moment is referenced in two [[Pierce Brosnan]] Bond films: in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', 007 appears put out when a pursuer he's forced off a cliff pulls the same trick; in ''[[Die Another Day]]'', the villain, [[Gustav Graves]], arrives at [[Buckingham Palace]] via [[Union Flag]] [[parachute]].
* When Bond finally confronts Stromberg at his dinner table, surrounded by Stromberg's crystal glassware, silver platter and candlestick, and gourmet seafood feast is a very ordinary, very contrasting bottle of McIlhenny's [[Tabasco sauce]]. The product had also been featured in the previous film in the series when [[Scaramanga]] demands that [[Nick Nack]] fetch him some in the opening line of dialogue in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.
* The microfilm container has a [[Minolta]] logo throughout the film. In real life, [[Sony]] currently owns the former [[Minolta]] [[DSLR]] inventory - especially the lenses.  
* One scene with Bond and Jaws at the pyramids was never shot with Roger Moore, instead the filmmakers found a photo of Moore, made a card board cutout and leaned it against a wall.
* In the second volume of his autobiography, [[Anthony Burgess]] claims to have worked on an early treatment for the movie. According to him, all his ideas were rejected with the exception of an oil tanker as the villain's headquarters.
* Roger Moore has said that, of the seven Bond films he had starred in, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' is his favorite.  Most film critics, such as [[Pauline Kael]], also tend to agree that ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' is the best of the Bond films starring Moore.
* Ian Fleming was so disappointed with "The Spy Who Loved Me" book that he only allowed th producers to use the name, They had to use another story.

==Novelisation==
{{splitsection|James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me}}
[[Image:SpyWhoLovedMeMovieNovel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|1977 Triad/Panther British paperback edition]]
When Ian Fleming sold the film rights to the James Bond novels to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, he only gave permission for the title ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' to be used. Since the screenplay for the film had nothing to do with Fleming's original novel, [[Glidrose Publications]], for the first time, authorised that a [[novelization|novelisation]] be written based upon the script. This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since ''[[Colonel Sun]]'' nearly a decade earlier. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], who co-authored the screenplay with [[Richard Maibaum]], was commissioned to write the book, which was given the title ''James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me''. Wood would also novelise the screenplay for the next Bond film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' in 1979.

The novelisation and the screenplay, although both written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelisation [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] is still active and still after James Bond. Their part in the novelisation begins during the "pre-title credits" sequence in which Bond is escaping from a cabin on the top of Aiguille du Mort, a mountain near the town of [[Chamonix]]. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for the whereabouts of the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts with a number of Bond stories, including the film ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]), in which a character remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH is mentioned to have been put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelization include the Bond girl Anya Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov as well as Colonel-General Niktin, a character from Fleming's novel ''[[From Russia with Love]]'' who has since become the head of SMERSH.

Other differences include the villain, [[Karl Stromberg]], being renamed as Sigmund Stromberg. The change of Stromberg's given name as well as the existence of SMERSH may be in some way due to the [[Thunderball (novel)#The controversy over the novel|controversy over ''Thunderball'']], in which [[Kevin McClory]] was made aware of certain plot points of the film ''The Spy Who Loved Me''. At one point the villain of the film was to be [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and his organization [[SPECTRE]]; however, this was changed to avoid a possible lawsuit over the rights to this character, which originated from the novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.
