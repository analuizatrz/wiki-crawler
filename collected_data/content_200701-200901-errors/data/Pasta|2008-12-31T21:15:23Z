A dictionary compiled by the 9th century Syrian physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali defines ''itriyya'' as string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking, probable evidence of Arab influence on the ancestor to modern-day dried pasta. One form of ''itrion'' with a long history is ''laganum'' (plural ''lagana''), which in Latin refers to a thin sheet of dough.<ref name=ss15>{{Harvcolnb|Serventi|Sabban|2002|pp=15–16}}</ref>

In the 1st century BC writings of Horace, ''lagana'' were fine sheets of dough which were fried<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Serventi|Sabban|2002|p=24}}</ref> and were an everyday food.<ref name=ss15/> Writing in the 2nd century [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]] provides a recipe for ''lagana'' which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavored with spices and deep-fried in oil.<ref name=ss15/> An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called ''lagana'' that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, a possible ancestor of modern-day ''[[Lasagna]]''.<ref name=ss15/> But the method of cooking these sheets of dough do not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product. The first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the thirteenth or fourthteenth century.<ref>{{cite book | last = Serventi | first = Silvano | coauthors = Françoise Sabban | others = Trans.

The name (λαγάνα, ''lagána'') survives in modern-day [[Greece]] to denote an unleavened, flat bread eaten during the [[Great Lent]]. The term "lagana" is also used in the Southern region of [[Calabria]], where it indicates a flat noodle.

Pasta is generally served with some type of sauce.  Common pasta sauces in [[Northern Italy]] include [[pesto]] and [[ragù alla bolognese]], which usually adds meat to the sauce.  In [[Central Italy]], we find simple [[tomato sauce]], [[amatriciana]] and [[carbonara]].  [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] sauces include spicy tomato, garlic, and olive oil, with the pasta often paired with fresh vegetables or seafood. Varieties include [[puttanesca]], ''pasta alla norma'' (tomatoes, eggplant and fresh or baked cheese), ''pasta con le sarde'' (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil), ''spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino'' (literally with garlic, (olive) oil and hot chili peppers).

[[Fettuccine alfredo]], with cream and cheese, and spaghetti with tomato sauce (with or without ground meat or meatballs) are popular Italian-style dishes in the [[United States]].

As pasta was introduced elsewhere in the world, it became incorporated into a number of local cuisines, which often have significantly different ways of preparation from those of Italy.  In [[Hong Kong]], the local Chinese have adopted pasta, primarily [[spaghetti]] and [[macaroni]], as an ingredient in the [[Hong Kong-style Western cuisine]].  In [[Cha chaan teng]], macaroni is cooked in water and served in broth with [[ham]] or [[sausage|frankfurter sausages]], peas, [[shiitake|black mushrooms]], and optionally [[egg (food)|eggs]], reminiscent of [[noodle soup]] dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare.<ref>AP, Explore the world of Canto-Western cuisine, January 8, 2007  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16440507/</ref>  This method often involves cooking the pasta well beyond the [[al dente]] stage and washing the starches off the pasta after cooking, measures frowned upon in Italy or in Hong Kong's more authentic Italian eateries.
