'''Paul Hegarty''' (born 30 May 1967 in Raphoe) is a past Irish footballer and the current manager of [[FAI Premier Division|Irish First Division]] club [[Finn Harps]].

==Playing career==
He played youth football in the [[Irish Ulster Senior League]] before signing with [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] where he made his League of Ireland debut on the 13th of September 1987. He later moved to [[Finn Harps F.C.]] before returning to [[Derry]] to play once more with City and [[Coleraine F.C.]]. He also had a spell at [[Institute F.C.]] as a player-manager. Hegarty was known throughout Ireland as one of the toughest tackling midfielders of his era.

==Managerial and Coaching==
Before becoming the assistant manager to [[Stephen Kenny (football)|Stephen Kenny]] at Derry City in 2005, Hegarty had a spell of management at Institute. His fiery temper and desire for his team to do well was evident during every game. This driven and determined attitude is reminiscent of the character Hegarty displayed on the field as a player. While at Derry, Hegarty was ever present on the sidelines as the club went on to win the [[FAI Cup]], finish second in the [[eircom League]] and enjoyed an historic run in the [[UEFA Cup]], being eliminated in the First Round by [[Paris St. Germain]]. On [[15 December]], [[2006]] Hegarty announced that he would be moving on from his role as assistant manager at Derry due to difficulties in relation to [[Pat Fenlon|Pat Fenlon's]] new training schedules for the 2007 season. With the managerial slot left empty at [[Finn Harps]] since [[Anthony Gorman|Anthony Gorman's]] departure, Hegarty looked like the favourite to take the role at [[Finn Park]].[http://www.derryjournal.com/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=3422&ArticleID=1932833] On [[20 December]], 2006 Hegarty was named the new boss at [[Finn Harps]] after signing a two-year deal with the club.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/6196141.stm]
Hegarty's touchline demeanour is well known to Irish football fans, and his high pitched shouted instructions can be heard on many a Friday night around Finn Park.  Whilst in his first season he won promotion with Finn Harps he has presided over their immediate return to the First Division of the League of Ireland.
