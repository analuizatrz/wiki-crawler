== Character creation ==
===Background===
Since [[List_of_Holby_City_episodes/Series_Eight#Series_Eight_.282005-2006.29|Series 8]] Episode 10 and the departure from the show of its [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|Maternity]] ward,<ref name="maternity">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20051220|title=Episode Update Tuesday 20th December|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[20 December]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref> [[Holby City]] has focused on three central wards - two surgical wards and an [[Acute Assessment Unit]]. Prior to the introduction of the character of Faye, there were just two [[Nurse#Nursing titles|Ward Sisters]] between these three wards - [[Chrissie Williams]] and [[Kyla Tyson]].  This imbalance was redressed with Faye's arrival and fast promotion from [[Nurse#Nursing titles|Bank Nurse]] to Sister of [[Holby_City#Current_wards|Keller Ward]].<ref name="promotion">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070424|title=Episode Update Tuesday 24th April|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[20 December]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref>

===Casting===
Prior to joining the [[Holby City]] cast, [[Patsy Kensit|Kensit]] was a regular in [[ITV]] soap [[Emmerdale]].<ref name="emmerdale">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000475/|title=Patsy Kensit|publisher=[[IMDb]]|date=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>  Announcing her new role as Faye Morton, Kensit spoke of the 45 minute commute to work on Holby as a deciding factor in her move - the long journey to and from filming Emmerdale cutting heavily into her time available to spend with her two sons.<ref name="commute">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.excite.co.uk/news/soaps/26170|title=Patsy Kensit joins Holby City cast|publisher=[[Excite]]|date=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> Although the character did not first appear on-screen until [[February]] [[2007]], the announcement that she would be joining the cast was made on [[14 December]] [[2005]].<ref name="patsy">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4527980.stm|title=Patsy Kensit to join Holby cast|date=[[14 December]] [[2005]]|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>  [[Holby City|Holby City's]] Executive Producer Richard Stokes and Series Producer Emma Turner said of Kensit's casting;
:"We are delighted to confirm that Patsy Kensit is joining the cast of Holby City. She's a talented and popular actress who lights up the screen. Her character will come into the show as a nurse who has more than a few secrets to hide and an attitude that cannot fail to ruffle the feathers of her colleagues."<ref name="gossip">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/gossip/patsy.shtml|title=Holby City - Gossip|date=[[14 December]] [[2005]]|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>
Kensit herself commented;
:"After two fantastic years at Emmerdale and ITV, I'm thrilled to be offered the opportunity of joining Holby City at the BBC. I'll really miss all my friends and colleagues at Emmerdale when I leave next August but look forward to living and working in London full time. Holby's a brilliant show." <ref name="gossip">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/gossip/patsy.shtml|title=Holby City - Gossip|date=[[14 December]] [[2005]]|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

==Character development==
===Personality===
Initial publicity for the character stressed her enigmatic origins, with the BBC billing her 'a nurse who has more than a few secrets to hide and an attitude that cannot fail to ruffle the feathers of her colleagues'.<ref name="intro">{{cite web|url=http://www.holby.tv/cgi-bin/News/fullnews.cgi?newsid1134566767,99035,|title=Patsy Kensit joins Holby|date=[[14 December]] [[2005]]|publisher=holby.tv|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> This was reflected in her first on-screen appearance, whereby she simply arrived at Holby City Hospital one day and requested that [[Specialist_registrar|registrars]] [[Jac Naylor]] and [[Joseph Byrne]] help her secure a nursing position without having to officially mention her previous employment in [[Dubai]].<ref name="joined">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070130|title=Episode Update Tuesday 30th Jan|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[30 January]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref>  How the three characters had come to meet and what had occurred between them was not revealed until two months later,<ref name="wlb">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070327|title=Episode Update Tuesday 27th Mar|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[27 March]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> and to present, the character very rarely references her own past.

In terms of attitude, the character is generally reluctant to draw attention to herself - worrying about being recognised by [[Kyla Tyson|Kyla Tyson's]] policeman husband [[Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives_2|Harvey]] following her arrest,<ref name="3april">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070403|title=Episode Update Tuesday 3rd Apr|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[3 April]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> and cooling off her developing relationship with [[Specialist_registrar|Cardio-Thoracic Registrar]] [[Sam Strachan]] when lead to believe he had been gossiping about their tryst.<ref name="14june">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070614|title=Episode Update Tuesday 14th Jun|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[14 June]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> However, she has been seen to be highly principled with regard to her career, and was the only member of nursing staff to refuse to join union action in episode ''Countdown''.<ref name="28june">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070628|title=Episode Update Tuesday 28th Jun|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[28 June]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>  Her lack of fear in challenging [[Surgeon|Staff Surgeon]] [[Thandie Abebe|Thandie Abebe's]] patient care in episode ''Leap of Faith'', regardless of negative reaction of her colleagues, lead [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] [[General Surgery|General Surgeon]] [[Dan Clifford]] to promote her on the spot to the position of [[Nurse#Nursing titles|Ward Sister]].<ref name="24april">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070424|title=Episode Update Tuesday 24th Apr|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[24 April]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

===Relationships===
[[Image:FayeMorton.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Sam dates both Faye and Chrissie at the same time]]
Currently, the character's relationship history remains very much an enigma. Although the BBC state she has been married three times,<ref name="character">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/characters/profiles/index.shtml?content/_faye/page1|title=Holby City - Characters|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref> only her most recent husband [[Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives_2|James]] has ever been mentioned on-screen.  While it was never explicitly shown to be so, it was heavily implied in flashback episode ''What Lies Beneath'' that the character was responsible for his death.<ref name="wlb">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070327|title=Episode Update Tuesday 27th Mar|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[27 March]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> Commenting on this aspect of her character, [[Patsy Kensit|Kensit]] explained that:
:"So there’s a scuffle and he pins her against the wall and practically tries to rape her. He ends up dead. It’s the way she deals with it — she coolly steps over his body and leaves. It turns out similar things have happened before. It’s a wonderful part."<ref name="rape">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2007130799,00.html|title=From wild child to content mum|publisher=[[The Sun]]|date=[[24 March]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>
Since arriving at Holby, the character has begun a tentative relationship with [[Specialist_registrar|Cardio-Thoracic Registrar]] [[Sam Strachan]].

The situation has recently escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his relationship with his old flame and Faye's colleague, [[Chrissie Williams]].  Kensit has said of the relationship: "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now.  But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!"<ref name="totaltv">{{Citation

Faye arrives in episode ''Into the Dark'', calling in a favour from [[Specialist registrar|Registrars]] [[Joseph Byrne]] and [[Jac Naylor]], and requesting that they help her gain employment as a [[Nursing_in_the_United_Kingdom#Hierarchy_.26_roles|Bank Nurse]] without her having to give details of her most recent employment records.<ref name="joined">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070130|title=Episode Update Tuesday 30th Jan|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[30 January]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref>  During the first few months of her employment at Holby, Faye remains close to Joseph, but does not get on well with Jac, who she speaks to sternly about her close relationship with Joseph’s father, [[Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives_2|Lord Byrne]].  In episode ''What Lies Beneath'' , flashbacks occur to the trio’s meeting in [[Dubai]].  Faye’s husband [[Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives_2|James]] reveals to her than he has lost her life savings of £50,000, ruining her plans of buying a nursing home on England.  The pair fight, and as James forces himself upon her at the top of their staircase, the scene cuts away.  An indefinite period of time later, Faye descends the stairs calmly, and steps over James’s dead body.  It is also revealed that Jac and Joseph performed an operation whilst pretending to be [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultants]], which Faye has been hiding for them since her arrival.  Although she is questioned by police over James’s death, she is not charged.<ref name="wlb">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/storyupdates/index.shtml?20070327|title=Episode Update Tuesday 27th Mar|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[27 March]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

===Criticism===
[[Image:FayeMortonNMC.jpg|thumb|right|100px|NMC magazine]]

:"The "did she, didn't she", story of the Dubai murder of Faye Morton's partner in Holby City recently demonstrates the ease with which writers can attach terrible storylines to a caring profession. Nurses who become prostitutes to pay the bills, nurses who kill their husbands, nurses who abuse the system to get their own way - Holby City has always been a hotbed of slanderous storylines. Good people doing bad things makes excellent entertainment... The bald fact is that real life nurses doing their jobs well just aren't that entertaining."<ref name="nmc">{{Citation
