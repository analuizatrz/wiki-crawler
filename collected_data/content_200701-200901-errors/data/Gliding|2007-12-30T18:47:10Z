'''Gliding''' is a [[recreation]]al activity and competitive [[sport]] in which pilots fly un-powered [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] known as [[glider]]s or sailplanes. Properly, the term ''gliding'' refers to descending flight of a heavier-than-air craft, whereas ''soaring'' is the correct term to use when the craft gains altitude or speed from rising air.<ref>{{cite web

When soaring conditions are good enough, experienced pilots can fly  hundreds of kilometres before returning to their home airfields, and occasionally flights over 1,000 kilometres are made.<ref>{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-12-21
}}</ref> However, if the weather deteriorates, they may need to make a [[forced landing]], also known as "landing out", but [[motorglider]] pilots can avoid this by starting an engine.

While many glider pilots merely enjoy the sense of achievement, some competitive pilots fly in races around pre-defined courses. These [[gliding competitions|competitions]] test the pilots' abilities to make best use of local weather conditions as well as their flying skills. Local and national competitions are organized in many countries and there are also biennial [[World Gliding Championships]].<ref>{{cite web

Powered aircraft and winches are the two most common means of launching gliders. These and other methods (apart from self-launching motor-gliders) require assistance from other participants. Gliding clubs have thus been established to share airfields and equipment, train new pilots and maintain high safety standards.

==History==
The development of heavier-than-air flight in the half-century between [[Sir George Cayley's coachman]] in 1853 and the [[Wright brothers]] mainly involved gliders (see [[aviation history]]). However, the ''sport'' of gliding only emerged after the [[World War I|First World War]] as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]],<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.ssa.org/UsTeam/adobe%20pdf/pr%20pdf/BR%20Soaring%20History%20V5%2004.pdf
| title = History of gliding
| accessdate = 2006-08-24
}}</ref> which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. Thus, in the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], while aviators and aircraft makers in the rest of the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. The active support of the government ensured a ready supply of experienced aviators ready to be trained in warplane operation when the treaty was abrogated in preparation for [[World War II]] by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] - though for most of the participants, their sport had no military overtones.

The first German gliding competition was held at the [[Wasserkuppe]]<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> in 1920,<ref name="history">
{{cite book |last= Welch |first= Ann |title= The Story of Gliding 2nd edition |publisher= [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] |year= 1980 |id = ISBN 0-7195-3659-6 }}</ref> organized by [[Oskar Ursinus]]. The best flight lasted two minutes and set a world distance record of 2 km.<ref name="history" /> Within ten years, it had become an international event in which the achieved durations and distances had increased greatly. In 1931, Gunther Grönhoff flew 272 km (169 miles) from [[Munich]] to [[Czechoslovakia]], further than had been thought possible.<ref name="history" />

[[Image:Minimoa.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The "gull wing" [[Göppingen Gö 3]] [[Minimoa]] produced in [[Germany]] starting in 1936.]]
In the [[1930s]], gliding spread to many other countries. In the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]] gliding was a [[demonstration sport]], and it was scheduled to be a full Olympic sport in the [[1940 Summer Olympics|1940 Games]]. A glider, the [[DFS Olympia Meise|Olympia]], was developed in Germany for the event, but World War II intervened. By 1939 the major gliding records were held by [[Russia]]ns, including a distance record of 748 km (465 miles).<ref name="history" />

During the war, civilian gliding in Europe was largely suspended. Although some military operations in WWII involved [[military glider]]s, they did not soar and so are unrelated to the sport of gliding. Nonetheless, several German [[Flying ace|fighter aces]] in the conflict, including [[Erich Hartmann]], began their flight training in gliders.

Gliding did not return to the Olympics after the war, for two reasons: first, the shortage of gliders following the war; and second, the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.)<ref name="history" /> The re-introduction of [[air sports]] such as gliding to the Olympics has been occasionally proposed by the world governing body, the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]], but this has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.<ref>{{cite web

In many countries during the [[1950s]] a large number of trained pilots wanted to continue flying. Many were also [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical engineers]]. They started both clubs and [[List of gliders|manufacturers]], many of which still exist. This stimulated the development of both gliding and gliders; for example, the [[Soaring Society of America]] grew from 1,000 members then to its present total of 12,500. The increased numbers of pilots, greater knowledge and improving technology helped set new records, so that the pre-war altitude record was doubled by 1950, and the first 1,000-km (621 statute miles) flight was done in 1964.<ref name="history" /> New materials such as [[Glass Fiber|glass fiber]] and [[carbon fiber]], advances in [[wing]] shapes and airfoils, electronic instruments, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and improved weather forecasting have since allowed many pilots to make flights that were once extraordinary. Today over 500 pilots have made flights over 1,000 km.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>

Instead of Olympic competition there are the [[World Gliding Championships]]. The first event was held at the Wasserkuppe in 1937.<ref name="history" /> Since WWII it has been held every two years. There are now six [[Glider Competition Classes|classes]] open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. [[Germany]], the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounts for 30% of the world's glider pilots,<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.fai.org/gliding/membership
| title = FAI membership summary
| accessdate = 2006-08-24
}}</ref> and the three major [[glider manufacturers]] are still based there. However the sport has been taken up in many countries and there are now over 116,000 active glider pilots,<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.fai.org/gliding/membership
| title = FAI membership summary
| accessdate = 2006-08-24
}}</ref> plus an unknown number of military cadets. Each year many other people experience their first glider flight. It does not matter whether the countries are flat or mountainous, hot or temperate, because gliders can soar in most places.

== Soaring ==
[[Image:Bluesky2.jpg|thumb|upright|Good gliding weather: Well-formed ''[[cumulus cloud|cumulus]] humilis'', with darker bases, suggests active [[thermal]]s and light winds.]]
Glider pilots can stay airborne for hours by flying through air that is ascending as fast or faster than the glider itself is descending, thus gaining [[potential energy]].<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.yorksoaring.com/whatissoaring.html
| title = Visual explanation of soaring
| accessdate = 2006-08-24
}}</ref> The most commonly used sources of rising air are
*[[thermal]]s (updrafts of warm air);
*[[Ridge Lift|ridge lift]] (found where the wind blows against the face of a hill and is forced to rise); and
*[[Lee waves|wave lift]] ([[standing wave]]s in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], analogous to the ripples on the surface of a stream).
Ridge lift rarely allows pilots to climb much higher than about 600&nbsp;m (2,000&nbsp;ft) above the terrain; thermals, depending on the climate and terrain, can allow climbs in excess of 3,000&nbsp;m (10,000&nbsp;ft) in flat country and much higher above mountains;<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.aircross.co.uk/sisteron/
| title = Mountain flying
| accessdate = 2006-09-14
}}</ref>
wave lift has allowed a glider to reach an altitude of 15,447&nbsp;m (50,671&nbsp;ft).<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.perlanproject.com/
| title = Altitude record
| accessdate = 2006-09-01
}}</ref> In a few countries, gliders may continue to climb into the clouds in uncontrolled airspace, but in many countries the pilot must stop climbing before reaching the cloud base (see [[Visual Flight Rules]]).

====Thermals====
[[Thermal]]s are streams of rising air that are formed on the ground through the warming of the surface by sunlight.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.yorksoaring.com/whatissoaring.html
| title = Diagram of thermals
| accessdate = 2006-09-05
}}</ref> If the air contains enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form [[cumulus cloud]]s. Once a thermal is encountered, the pilot usually flies in circles to keep the glider within the thermal, so gaining altitude before flying off to the next thermal and towards the destination. This is known as "thermalling". Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating [[cloud street]]s. These can allow the pilot to fly straight while climbing in continuous lift.

When the air has little moisture or when an [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] stops the warm air from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or [[dust devil]]s to mark the thermals, the pilot must use his skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a [[variometer]] that quickly indicates climbs or descents. Typical locations to find thermals are over towns, freshly [[plough]]ed fields and [[asphalt]] roads, but thermals are often hard to associate with any feature on the ground. Occasionally thermals are caused by the exhaust gases from [[power station]]s or by fires.

As it requires rising heated air, thermalling is only effective in mid-latitudes from spring through into late summer. During winter the solar heat can only create weak thermals, but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.

[[Image:RidgeSrn.gif|thumb|left|A Scimitar glider ridge soaring in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania USA]]

==== Ridge lift ====
A [[Ridge lift|ridge soaring]] pilot uses air lifted up the sides of hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.yorksoaring.com/whatissoaring.html
| title = Diagram of ridge lift
| accessdate = 2006-09-05
}}</ref>
In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, though records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of [[exhaustion]].<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Lenticular4.jpg.jpeg|thumb|right|A lenticular cloud produced by a mountain wave]]

==== Wave lift ====
The powerfully rising and sinking air in [[Lee Wave|mountain waves]] was discovered by a glider pilot, [[Wolf Hirth]], in 1933.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.nateferguson.com/glider.html
| title = Article about wave lift
| accessdate = 2006-09-28
}}</ref>
Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, if pilots use supplementary [[oxygen]] to avoid [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].
This lift is often marked by long, stationary [[lenticular cloud|lenticular]] (lens-shaped) clouds lying perpendicular to the wind.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.yorksoaring.com/whatissoaring.html
| title = Diagram of wave lift
| accessdate = 2006-09-05
}}</ref> 
Most altitude records for gliders have been set this way. The current world distance record of 3,008&nbsp;km (1,869 statute miles) by Klaus Ohlmann (set on [[21 January]] [[2003]])<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://records.fai.org/gliding/current.asp?id1=DO&id2=1
| title = Distance record
| accessdate = 2006-08-24
}}</ref> was flown using mountain waves in [[South America]].

A rare wave phenomenon is known as [[Morning glory cloud|Morning Glory]], a [[roll cloud]] producing strong lift. Pilots near Australia's [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] make use of it in [[spring (season)|springtime]].<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.cloudappreciationsociety.org/a/glory/glory1.html
| title = Morning Glory
| accessdate = 2006-09-27
}}</ref>

[[Image:SeaBreeze.jpg|thumb|left|Schematic cross section through a sea breeze front. If the air inland is moist, cumulus often marks the front.]]

==== Other sources of lift ====
The boundaries where two air masses meet are known as [[convergence zone]]s.<ref>
{{cite book |last= Bradbury |first= Tom |title= Meteorology and Flight: Pilot's Guide to Weather (Flying & Gliding) |publisher= A & C Black |year= 2000 |id = ISBN 0-7136-4226-2}}</ref>
These can occur in [[sea breeze]]s or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary like a shallow [[cold front]]. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection as if it were a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.

Glider pilots have been able to use a technique called "[[dynamic soaring]]",<ref>
{{cite book |last= Reichmann |first= Helmut |title= Streckensegelflug |publisher= Motorbuch Verlag |year= 2005 |id = ISBN 3-613-02479-9 }}</ref> where a glider can gain [[kinetic energy]] by repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of different horizontal velocity. However, such zones of high "[[wind gradient]]" are usually too close to the ground to be used safely by gliders.

==Launch methods==
Gliders, not having engines, use various methods to take off. Glider pilots who want to use the different types of launch methods must be in current practice in each. [[Glider pilot license|Licensing]] rules in some countries differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.

===Aerotowing===
[[Image:AT0134.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[Piper Pawnee]] aerotowing a glider]]
Aerotows normally use single-engined light aircraft, although [[Motor glider#Touring motor glider|motor gliders]] have also been permitted to tow gliders. The tow-plane takes the glider to the desired height and place where the glider pilot releases the rope<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.sugc.net/launch.php
| title = Further information on launch methods
| accessdate = 2006-09-03
}}</ref>. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the [[airframe]] of the tow-plane.

During the aerotow, the glider pilot keeps the glider in one of two positions behind the tow-plane<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://home.att.net/~jdburch/aerotow.htm
| title = Aerotowing explained
| accessdate = 2006-09-03
}}</ref>. This position can either be the "low tow" position, just below the [[Wake turbulence|wake]] from the tow-plane, or the "high tow" position just above the wake.<ref>{{cite book
| title = Glider Flying Handbook

| accessdate = 2006-11-25

}}</ref> In [[Australia]] the convention is to fly in low tow, whereas in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] the high tow prevails.<ref>{{cite web

| title = On-line debate on the relative merits of high tow versus low tow and where each method is used
| accessdate = 2006-10-09
}}</ref> One aerotow variation is to attach two gliders to one tow-plane, using a short rope for the high towed glider and the long rope for the low tow.

===Wire launching===

====Winch-launching====
[[Image:Schleppwinde-anspach-taunus001.jpg|thumb|left|A typical winch]]
[[Image:V20001.jpg|thumb|right| 250px|A Ventus 2b being winch-launched at [[Lasham Airfield]].]]
Gliders are often launched using a stationary ground-based [[winch]] mounted on a heavy vehicle.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.sugc.net/launch.php
| title = Further information on launch methods
| accessdate = 2006-09-03
}}</ref> This method is widely used at many European clubs, often in addition to aerotowing. The engine is usually a large [[diesel engine|diesel]], though [[hydraulic fluid]] engines and [[electrical motor]]s are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 1,600&nbsp;m (3,000 to 5,500-foot) cable, made of steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 400 to 700&nbsp;m (1,300 to 2,200 feet) after a short and steep ride.

The main advantage of a winch launch is its lower cost, but the launch height is usually lower than an aerotow, so flights are shorter unless the pilot can quickly make contact with a source of lift within a few minutes of releasing the cable. Although there is a risk of the cable breaking during this type of launch, pilots are trained to deal with this.

====Auto-tow====
[[Image:Bungylaunch1.jpg|thumb|right|250px||A bungee launch at the [[Long Mynd]] by the Midland Gliding Club]]
Another launch method, the "autotow", is rarer nowadays.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.air-space.us/rec.aviation.soaring/38/Re-Auto-Tow-Information-article1891.htm
| title = Autotow launching information and discussion
| accessdate = 2006-09-28
}}</ref> The direct towing method requires a hard surface, a powerful vehicle and a long steel cable. After gently taking up slack in the cable, the driver [[acceleration|accelerates]] hard and the glider rises like a kite to as much as 400 m (1300 feet) if there is a good [[headwind]] and a [[runway]] of 1.5&nbsp;km (1 mile) or more. This method has also been used on desert [[playa|dry lakes]]. 

A variation on this is the "reverse pulley" method in which the truck drives towards the glider that it is launching with the cable passing around a pulley at the far end of the airfield, with an effect similar to a winch launch.

===Bungee launch===<!-- This section is linked from [[Human-powered transport]] -->
Bungee launching was widely used in the early days of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a strong breeze using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or "[[bungee cord|bungee]]".<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.glidingmagazine.com/FeatureArticle.asp?id=386
| title = Bungee launching explained
| accessdate = 2006-09-28
}}</ref> For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the pilot releases the wheel brake and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.

==Cross-country==
[[Image:Nimbus2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Glider on a cross-country flight in the Alps]]
The distance that a glider can fly for each meter it descends is expressed as its [[lift-to-drag ratio]] (L/D). Depending on the [[Glider Competition Classes|class]], this can be between 44:1 and 70:1 in modern designs. This performance combined with regular sources of rising air enables gliders to fly long distances at high speeds.<ref>{{cite web

| title = FAI World records page

Glider pilots are required to stay within gliding range of their home airfield for their early solo flights.  Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate and to land elsewhere if necessary.  As the performance of gliders improved in the [[1960s]], the concept of flying as far away as possible became unpopular with the crews who had to retrieve the gliders. Pilots now usually plan to fly around a course (called a ''task'') via [[waypoint|turn-points]], returning to the starting point.

In addition to just trying to fly further, glider pilots also race each other in [[Gliding competitions|competitions]].<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.lasham.org.uk/comps/introduction/competitions.asp
| title = Introduction to gliding competitions
| accessdate = 2006-09-28
}}</ref> The winner is the fastest, or, if the weather conditions are poor, the furthest round the course. Tasks of up to 1,000&nbsp;km have been set<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.egc2005.fi/results/index.html
| title = Typical competition results
| accessdate = 2006-08-24
}}</ref> and speeds of 120&nbsp;km/h are not unusual.

Initially, ground observers confirmed that pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure [[GNSS Flight Recorders]] that record the position every few seconds from [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.lasham.org.uk/comps/introduction/typical.asp
| title = How competitions are monitored and scored
| accessdate = 2006-09-28
}}</ref> These recording devices now provide the proof that the turn-points have been reached.

National competitions generally last one week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed the greatest number of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so gliding competitions have been difficult to televise.

In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the [[Grand Prix gliding|Grand Prix]], has been introduced.<ref>{{cite web

| title = Sailplane Grand Prix

===Maximizing speed===
Soaring pioneer [[Paul MacCready]] is usually credited with developing a mathematical theory for optimizing the speed to fly when cross-country soaring,<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://home.att.net/~jdburch/polar.htm
| title = MacCready Theory
| accessdate = 2006-08-24
}}</ref> though it was first described by Wolfgang Späte (who later became famous for flying [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] ''Komet'' rocket fighters with the Luftwaffe late in World War II) in 1938.<ref>{{cite journal

It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their flight speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers. The greatest factor in maximizing speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.<ref>{{cite web

On cross-country flights where strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the [[wing]]s and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the [[center of gravity]], which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar.<ref name="ballast">{{cite web
| url = http://home.comcast.net/~verhulst/GBSC/student/ballast.html
| title = Water ballast
| accessdate = 2006-09-28
}}</ref> Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time.<ref name="ballast" /> If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.

defines the rules for observers and recording devices to validate the claims for badges, which are defined by kilometers of distance and meters of altitude gained. The Silver-C badge was introduced in 1930.<ref name="origins of badges" /> Earning the Silver Badge shows that a glider pilot has achieved an altitude gain of at least 1,000&nbsp;m, made a five-hour duration flight, and has flown cross-country for a straight-line distance of at least 50&nbsp;km: these three attainments are usually, but not invariably, achieved in separate flights. The Gold and Diamond Badges require pilots to fly higher and further. A pilot who has completed the three parts of the Diamond Badge has flown 300&nbsp;km to a pre-defined goal, has flown 500&nbsp;km in one flight (but not necessarily to a pre-defined goal) and gained 5,000&nbsp;m in height. The FAI also issues a diploma for a flight of 1,000&nbsp;km and further diplomas for increments of 250&nbsp;km.

===Landing out===
[[Image:OL0026.jpg|thumb|left|Pilot and crew about to de-rig a glider]]
If lift is not found during a cross-country flight, for example because of deteriorating weather, the pilot must choose a field and 'land out'.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.esparacing.com/sport_pilot/comp_soaring.htm
| title = Cross country flying and landing out
| accessdate = 2006-09-04
}}</ref> Although inconvenient and often mistaken for "emergency landings", landing out (or "outlanding") is a routine event in cross-country gliding. The pilot has to choose a field where the glider can be landed safely, without damaging property such as crops or livestock.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.lasham.org.uk/members/task/fieldcode/fieldcode.html
| title = Code of practice for field landings
| accessdate = 2006-09-04
}}</ref>

The glider and the pilot(s) can be retrieved from the field using a purpose-built trailer. Alternatively, if the glider has landed in a suitable field, a tow-plane can be summoned to re-launch the aircraft (as long as the property owner gives permission). The glider pilot typically pays for the time the tow-plane is in the air, both to and from the field, so this alternative can become expensive.

===Use of engines===
[[Image:Ash-25.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Schleicher ASH 25|ASH25M]] - a self-launching two-seater glider]]To avoid the inconvenience of landing out, some gliders are [[motor glider]]s, optionally fitted with a small engine and a retractable propeller, adding both weight and expense. Two principal categories of engine are used: more powerful ones for 'self launching,' which makes the glider independent of a tow plane, and less powerful 'sustainer' engines that can prolong flight but are not powerful enough for launching. However, engines have to be started at a height that includes a margin that would still allow a safe landing-out to be made, if the engine were to fail to start.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.dg-flugzeugbau.de/ls8-ewald-e.html
| title = Information about self-sustaining gliders
| accessdate = 2006-09-04
}}</ref> 

In a competition, starting the engine ends the soaring flight. Gliders without an engine are lighter and, as they do not need a safety margin for an engine-start, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. So, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://asa.thixo.com/Guide_downloads.cfm
| title = Guide to Self-launching Sailplane Operation
| accessdate = 2006-09-04
}}</ref> Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer. Opinions differ whether difficult flights, where an engine was always available, are as satisfying as flights in pure gliders.

==Aerobatics==
[[image:SW0001.jpg|left|thumb|[[S-1 Swift]] - modern aerobatic glider]]
[[Aerobatic]] competitions are held regularly.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.aerobatics.org.uk/glider_badge_scheme.htm
| title = Information about gliding aerobatics
| accessdate = 2006-08-24
}}</ref>
In this type of competition, the pilots fly a program of maneuvers (such as inverted flight, loop, roll, and various combinations). Each maneuver has a rating called the "K-Factor".<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.glideraerobatics.com/UK/CIVA_Catalogue/Catalog_Power.pdf
| title = FAI Aerobatics Catalogue
| accessdate = 2006-10-09
}}</ref> Maximum points are given for the maneuver if it is flown perfectly; otherwise, points are deducted. Efficient maneuvers also enable the whole program to be completed with the height available. The winner is the pilot with the most points.

==Hazards==
Gliders, unlike [[hang gliders]] and [[paragliding|paragliders]], surround the pilot with a strong structure, so most accidents cause no injuries,<ref name=accidents>{{cite journal

}}</ref> of mid-air collisions between gliders because the pilots tend to fly to the same areas of lift. To avoid other gliders and [[general aviation]] traffic, pilots must comply with the rules of the air and keep a good lookout. They also usually wear [[parachute]]s. In several European countries and [[Australia]], the [[FLARM]] warning system is used to help avoid mid-air collisions between gliders.<ref>{{cite web

==Challenges for the gliding movement==
Gliding as a sport faces challenges in the years ahead.<ref>{{cite web

These include:
*Time pressures on participants: gliding typically takes whole days, which many people today find harder to devote. As a result the average age of glider pilots is increasing
*[[Airspace]]: in many European countries the growth of [[civil aviation]] is reducing the amount of [[uncontrolled airspace]]
*Competition from other activities: there is now a greater variety of similar sports such as [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]] that may attract potential glider pilots.
*Lack of publicity: without coverage by television, many people are unaware of competitive gliding.
*Increasing costs, due to higher costs of fuel and insurance, and due to greater regulation requiring equipment such as new [[radio|radios]] or [[transponder|transponders]].

==Learning to glide==
[[Image:Blanik_3_a.jpg|thumb|left|The [[LET L-13|Blanik L-23]], a common training glider]]
Most clubs offer trial lessons to people interested in learning to glide. [[National gliding associations]] have contact details for their member clubs. Because most gliders are designed to the same specifications of safety, the upper weight limit for pilots, after allowing for a parachute, is usually 103 kg (228 pounds). People over 193cm (6’ 4’’) will also have problems. The pupil flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/miskin/gliding/
| title = Learning to glide
| accessdate = 2006-09-18
}}</ref> The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically from the back seat, but otherwise the pupil manages the controls. Some clubs offer courses over several days, with a mixture of winch and aerotow launches. It may take [[ab initio]]s at least 50 training flights before they are deemed to have the skill and the [[airmanship]] necessary to fly solo.<ref>{{cite web

If winches are used, the cost of learning to glide is much less than that of learning to fly powered aircraft. Training using aerotow costs more than using winches, though fewer launches (as few as 30) might be needed. [[Flight simulator|Simulators]] are also beginning to be used in training, especially during poor weather.

After the first solo flight, further training with an instructor continues until the pupil is  capable of taking a glider cross-country. In most countries pilots must sit examinations on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors.

==Related air sports==
[[Hang gliding|Hang-gliding]] uses simpler and cheaper aircraft in which [[aviator|pilot]]s exercise control by shifting body weight, whereas glider-pilots use conventional flight controls. Hang-gliders typically use fabric [[wing]]s, shaped over a rigid framework. The lower aerodynamic efficiency of these wings means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in gliders. Unlike the hang-gliders' wings, [[Paragliding|paragliders]]' wings have no frames and their shape is entirely formed by the pressure of the air. The aerodynamic efficiency of paragliders is lower still and so cross-country flights are even shorter. [[Radio-controlled glider|Radio-controlled gliding]] uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring.
