'''The King's Regiment (Liverpool)''' was one of the oldest [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s of the [[British Army]], having been formed in 1685 and numbered as the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot]] in 1751. Unlike most British regiments, which were associated with a [[county]], the King's was the [[city]] regiment of [[Liverpool]], one of only four regiments affiliated to a city in the British Army <ref>The other "city" regiments were  [[The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)]], [[The Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment)]] (from 1923), and [[The Manchester Regiment]]).</ref> After 273 years of continuous existence, the regiment was amalgamated with the Manchesters in 1958. 

The King's notably saw active service in the [[Second Boer War]], the two [[world war]]s, and the [[Korean War]]. Nine [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded to the regiment, the first in 1900 and the last in 1918. An additional two were awarded to [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] officer [[Noel Godfrey Chavasse]], who was attached to [[the Liverpool Scottish]] during the [[World War I|First World War]].

In peacetime, the regiment's battalions were based in the United Kingdom and colonies in the [[British Empire]]. Duties varied: riots were suppressed in Belfast, England, and the Middle East; bases were garrisoned in places such as the [[North-West Frontier Province]] and [[West Germany]]; and reviews and parades conducted throughout the regiment's history.   

The regiment has been referred to variously as '''L'POOL R''', '''the Liverpools''', '''KLR''', and '''the King's'''. Usage of "L'POOL R" and "the Liverpools" was most prevalent from the 1880s to the 1920s.

==Colonial wars (1881-1914)==
[[Image:D Company, King's R, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|250px|left|"D" Company of the 1st King's, Wellington Barracks, [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], early 1890s.]]  
The [[Cardwell reforms]] and [[Childers reforms]] from the 1860s to the 1880s substantially reorganised the British Army.<ref>Chandler (2003), p188-89</ref> Childers reforms principally entailed single-[[battalion]] regiments amalgamating to form regiments of multiple battalions. Though the King's remained unamalgamted, the abolition of the numbering system in favour of city or county affiliation affected its title.<ref>Chandler (2003), p189. See the [[List of British Army regiments (1881)|list of British Army regiments]] for details of the 1881 structure.</ref> Thus, on [[1 July]] [[1881]], the two battalions of the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, '''The King's (Liverpool Regiment)'''. The 8th Foot had been associated with Liverpool since 1873, when the regiment was allocated to the 13th Brigade Depot in Liverpool. Regular regiments gained auxiliary battalions through the integration of the [[militia]] and [[Volunteer Army (British)|volunteers]]. Nine militia and volunteer battalions from [[Lancashire]] and the [[Isle of Man]] transferred to the King's, and ultimately became part of the Special Reserve and [[Territorial Army|Territorial Force]]. Individual distinctions were retained by these battalions, such as unique titles, [[cap badge]]s, [[military uniform|uniforms]], and honorary colonels. Of these, the most overtly individual were the [[Liverpool Rifles]] (6th Btn), [[Liverpool Irish]] (8th Btn), and [[Liverpool Scottish]] (10th Btn).

Under the new system, it was envisaged that one regular battalion would be based in the United Kingdom and one overseas.<ref>Chandler (2003), p189</ref> The 1st Battalion had been located in [[North West England]] since the late 1870s. While based in Salford Barracks, Manchester, the battalion was subject to a bomb attack by the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] ("Fenians"). The barracks sustained minor structural damage as a result of the explosion, which killed a child and badly wounded its mother.<ref>Mileham (2000), p59.</ref> Civil disorder during a minesworkers' strike required the intervention of the battalion to quell the riots that had broken out. In 1882, the battalion was posted to [[Ireland]], based in [[the Curragh]]. Though the posting was uneventful overalll, the battalion was employed after sectarian riots broke out in [[Belfast]] following the introduction of the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|1886 Home Rule Bill]] in the [[British House of Commons|British Parliament]]. The battalion returned to England three-years later.

The 2nd King's overseas service in the 1880s was punctuated by the [[Third Burmese War]], which began in 1885. It had been based on the [[Indian subcontinent]] since 1877 and had fought in the [[Second Afghan War]]. Invasion of [[Upper Burma]] began in October in the form of the Burma Field Force. Making swift progress up the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]], the force captured frontier forts and the capital [[Myingyan]]. Following the capital's capture, the battalion provided an escort that oversaw the exile of [[Thibaw Min|King Thibaw]]. A seven-year [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] campaign against the British followed the completion of Upper Burma's annexation on [[1 January]] [[1886]]. The 2nd King's operated in small groups against the guerillas in the Burmese jungle for over a year. Casualties numbered 12 officers and 256 men by the time the battalion returned to India. The battalion was subsequently posted to [[Aden]] for a year before returning to Britain in 1892. Overseas service for the 1st King's included a two-year stay in [[Nova Scotia]], becoming the last battalion of the regiment to garrison Canada. The battalion was posted to the [[West Indies]] in 1895, then [[Natal Colony]] in 1897. The [[Second Boer War]] began two-years later.

Prior to the outbreak of the war, as relations between the British and [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] deteriorated, the 1st King's formed a company of [[mounted infantry]] and moved to [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], where it underwent intensive training. War was declared on [[11 October]] and Natal invaded by a Boer force under General [[Piet Joubert]]. General [[George Stuart White|George White]] held authority over 13,000 British personnel dispersed throughout Natal.<ref>Fremont-Barnes (2003), ''The Boer War 1899-1902'', p35</ref> Heavy losses were incurred by the British in the first major engagements of the war, at [[Battle of Talana Hill|Talana Hill]] and [[Battle of Elandslaagte|Elandslaagte]]. Retreat to Ladysmith ensued, where the largest British contingent was concentrated.<ref>Fremont-Barnes (2003), ''The Boer War 1899-1902'', p36</ref> Having besieged [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafikeng]], Boers converged upon Ladysmith and positioned artillery pieces on surrounding hills overlooking the town.

[[Image:Positions round Ladysmith - November 1899 - Project Gutenberg eText 16466.jpg|thumb|A map of Ladysmith, November 1899.]]
Northern positions occupied by Boers were subjected to an attack ordered by General White on [[30 October]]. White's plans were described as vague, ambitious, and complicated, the battle was ultimately disastrous and became known to the British as "Mournful Monday".<ref>Fremont-Barnes (2003), ''The Boer War 1899-1902'', p73</ref><ref name="Ladysmith Times">Amery (1902-1906), [http://rsi.co.za/BoerWar/Ladysmith.htm Times History of the War in South Africa, 1899 - 1902], rsi.co.za.

Ladysmith was enclosed on [[2 November]], beginning the [[Siege of Ladysmith|118-day siege]]. The King's were commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Llewelyn Mellor and assigned to the north-eastern defensive sector under Colonel Knox, a disciplinarian who instituted a programme of fortification development in his area.<ref>Chisholm (1979), ''Ladysmith'', p95</ref><ref name="Ladysmith Kings">Mileham (2000), p69-70</ref> Construction of the defences occurred mostly at night. Rain, oppressive heat, and cold provided little opportunity for rest.<ref name="Ladysmith Kings"/> An attempt by Boers to penetrate the southern perimeter of Ladysmith was repulsed on [[6 January]], during which the King's mounted infantry contributed to the defence. The scarcity of supplies had become particularly acute by late January. Disease had become rife and the town resorted to consuming the garrison's horses and mules.<ref>(1902), ''The Rifle Brigade Chronicle'', p107</ref> 

Reinforcements had begun to arrive in November under General [[Redvers Buller]]. The relief of the three besieged garrisons became the general's priority. He divided his corps and assumed personal command of the Ladysmith expedition.<ref>Fremont-Barnes (2003), ''The Boer War 1899-1902'', p40</ref> Three successive defeats in December, termed by the British as "[[Black Week]]", were followed by further reverses in January and early February. Relief for the beleaguered garrison of Ladysmith arrived on [[28 February]]. The 1st King's were subsequently augmented by a company of Volunteers and its mounted infantry incorporated into an MI battalion.<ref>Mileham (2000), p73</ref> Britain's prosecution of the war extended into the territory of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal Republic]]. On [[21 August]], at Van Wyk's Vlei, Sergeant [[Harry Hampton|Hampton]] and Corporal [[Henry James Knight|Knight]] were awarded the Victoria Cross for holding their positions and evacuating wounded Kingsmen of the mounted infantry while under heavy fire. Two-days later, the 1st Battalion was attacked while at the forefront of an advance south of Dalmanutha. Their ammunition almost expended and casualties numerous during the protracted engagement, the King's were ordered to withdraw.<ref>Mileham (2000)< p74</ref> Casualties were in excess of 70 and Private [[William Edward Heaton|Heaton]] was awarded the Victoria Cross.<ref>Doyle (1900), ''The Great Boer War'', p492</ref>

The nominal annexation of the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic in May and September respectively did not resolve the war. Instead, the Boer commandos transitioned to [[guerilla warfare]] and resisted British occupation until 1902. The King's concentrated in the Eastern Transvaal, where Boers under [[Louis Botha|Botha]] and Viljoen operated. Detachments were assigned to [[armoured train]]s and networks of [[blockhouse]]s.<ref>Mileham (2000), p75</ref> One such detachment was overwhelmed under controversial circumstance at Helvetia on [[29 December]]. Situated near the [[Lydenburg]]-[[Machadodorp]] railway, Helvetia was principally garrisoned by a contingent of the King's and contained a 4.7-in gun nicknamed "Lady Roberts". The nocturnal attack, conducted in fog, yielded considerable success for the Boers; scores of prisoners were taken and the gun captured. Only King's Kopje withstood the attack.<ref>Maurice & Grant (1910), ''History of the War in South Africa, 1899-1902'', p26</ref> Major Stapleton Cotton, who ordered the surrender, was sentenced by a general court-martial to be [[Degradation Ceremony|cashiered]] and dismissed from the army. This decision was considered to be unjust by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who contended that the wounds Major Cotton sustained merited "some revision" of the officer's sentence.<ref>Doyle (2004), ''The Great Boer War'', p351</ref>

The Boer War had provided the first opportunity for the regiment's volunteer battalions to serve overseas with the regular forces, supplying small detachments and service companies for the 1st King's and other units. In contrast, the regiment's militia battalions, numbered the 5th and 6th, were sent to South Africa as intact units late in the war. A monument commemorating the regiment's service in Afghanistan, Burma, and South Africa was erected in [[St John's Gardens]] and unveiled by Field Marshal Sir George White on [[9 September]] [[1905]]. The monument was sculpted by Sir [[William Goscombe John]].

==World War I (1914-1918)==
===1914-1915===
[[Image:Liverpool Pals inspection, 1915.jpg|thumb|230px|left|The inspection of the Liverpool Pals by Lord Kitchener in front of [[St George's Hall, Liverpool]], [[20 March]] 1915.]]

The regiment fielded 49 battalions during [[World War I|the war]] from a pre-war establishment of two regular, two [[militia]], and six [[Territorial Army|territorial]]. Of those 49 battalions, 22 served extensively, receiving 58 [[battle honour]]s and six [[Victoria Cross]]es for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Balkans]], [[North-West Frontier in World War I|India]], and [[Russian Civil War|Russia]]. Some 13,795 Kingsmen died during the course of the war, the battalions suffering an average of 615 deaths.<ref>Middlebrook (2000), p163</ref> Thousands more were wounded, sick, or taken prisoner. Of higher formations, the Liverpool Pals sustained nearly 2,800 casualties and the [[British 55th (West Lancashire) Division|55th Division's]] 165th (Liverpool) Brigade, composed entirely of battalions from the King's, had losses of 1,672 dead, 6,056 wounded, and 953 missing during the period of [[3 January]] [[1916]] and [[11 November]] [[1918]].<ref> Coop (1919/2001), p183</ref>

[[Image:Kitchener-Britons.jpg|right|180px|thumb|A recruitment poster featuring Lord Kitchener.]]

A vigorous [[Recruitment to the British Army during World War I|recruiting campaign]] involving pre-war personalities such as [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchner]] and [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] facilitated the rapid expansion of the British Army. Territorial units formed duplicate battalions from August 1914 to May 1915. To distinguish them from the originals, they were designated as, for instance, the 2/5th and 3/5th Battalions respectively. Second-line territorial battalions had been raised for home service and recruit training duties, but were ultimately dispatched to the Western Front themselves and replaced by the third-line battalions.<ref>Middlebrook (2000), p115</ref> Driven by a conviction that the war would not be resolved quickly and seeking an alternative to the Territorial Army, Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener appealed for an initial 100,000 volunteers who would form a [[Kitchener's Army|"New Army"]].<ref>Middlebrook (2000), p40</ref><ref>Baker, [http://www.1914-1918.net/kitchen.htm The New Armies: "Kitchener's Men"], 1914-1918.net</ref> The 17th Earl of Derby proposed forming a battalion of [[Pals battalion|"Pals"]] for the King's Regiment, to be recruited from men of the same workplace. His proposal proved successful. Within a week, thousands of Liverpudlians had volunteered and were eventually formed into the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Battalions. They were known as the City of Liverpool battalions or "[[Liverpool Pals]]". Lord Derby addressed recruits on [[28 August]]: 

{{cquote|This should be a battalion of Pals, a battalion in which friends from the same office will fight shoulder to shoulder for the honour of Britain and the credit of Liverpool.<ref> Maddocks (1991), p24 [http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConNarrative.165&chapterId=1264 Full speech]</ref>}} 

Mobilisation occurred at the onset of the war in August 1914, at which time the 1st King's was based at [[Aldershot]]. Under command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.S. Bannatyne, the 1st King's proceeded to [[Southampton]] and embarked aboard the SS ''Irrawaddy''.<ref>Wyrall (2002), p2-5</ref> The battalion landed at [[Le Havre]] on [[13 August]] with the [[British 6th Infantry Brigade|6th Brigade]], [[British 2nd Division (World War I)|2nd Division]], one of the original components of the [[British Expeditionary Force]] that landed in August. The BEF's first encounter with the German Army at [[Battle of Mons|Mons]], [[Belgium]], was followed by a retreat that would last until [[5 September]] and end at the [[Marne]], a river east of [[Paris]]. Having acted as a rearguard to the 2nd Division, the 1st King's and its brigade were ordered to prevent a German force cutting off the 4th (Guards) Brigade, forming the rearguard at [[Villers-Cotteréts]], and 70th Battery, [[Royal Horse Artillery]]. The guns were extricated through the actions of the brigade, earning them praise from the 2nd Division's commanding officer, General [[Charles Carmichael Monro|Monro]]. <ref>Mileham (2000), p84 </ref>

Paris was saved with the halting of the German advance at [[First Battle of the Marne|the Marne]]; the ensuing retreat, which prompted an Allied counter-offensive, ended at [[First Battle of the Aisne|the Aisne]]. After both battles were fought, the battalion moved north to [[Ypres]] during the so-called "[[Race to the Sea]]". In an action at [[Langemarck]] during the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the battalion captured the small village of Molenaarelstoek, just north-east of [[Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke|Polygon Wood]]. As the battle progressed, the Germans sought a decisive victory against the outnumbered BEF and launched the last major assault of the battle on [[11 November]].<ref>[[Winston Groom|Groom]] (2003), A Storm in Flanders: The Ypres Salient, 1914-1918: Tragedy and Triumph on the Western Front, p63</ref><ref>Lomas, ''First Ypres, 1914'', p84</ref> Located to the south of Polygon Wood, the 1st King's was one of only a few units available to meet the attack. A composite division of the élite Prussian Guard, advancing in dense formations, was initially successful before it was pushed back after momentum was lost. In the defence of Polygon Wood, the 1st King's held onto their positions, effectively destroying the 3rd [[Prussia]]n [[Foot Guards]] with concentrated rapid-fire and artillery support.<ref>[[Robin Neillands|Neillands]] (2004), ''The Old Contemptibles'', p324</ref><ref>Wyrall (2002), p</ref> By the end of the battle, the 1st King's casualties numbered 33 officers and 814 other ranks (OR) from an original strength of 27 officers and 991 ORs.<ref> Mileham (2000), p87 </ref> Among the battalion's dead was the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Bannatyne, killed by a [[sniper]] on [[24 October]].

[[Image:British infantry skirmish 1914.jpg|180px|thumb|right|German forces advancing against the 4th King's in 1915.]]

By the end of March 1915, eight battalions of the King's were serving on the Western Front. The 1st and 1/5th took part in a "holding" attack designed to support the Allied offensive at [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]].<ref>Wyrall (2002), p110</ref> An ineffectual preliminary bombardment failed to destroy large sections of the [[barbed wire]], impeding the 1st King's advance. Heavy casualties were incurred as a result of the withering hail-of-fire directed at the King's, one of whom was the wounded Colonel Carter.<ref name="Neuve Chapelle">Wyrall (2002, pp113-114</ref> One platoon, under Lieutenant Miller, managed to reach the German lines. The platoon blockaded itself in the communications trench and held on for over an hour, under fire from their own artillery, until they withdrew to British lines. <ref name="Neuve Chapelle"/> In this engagement, the battalion's casualties amounted to 61 killed, 115 wounded, and 62 missing<ref name="Neuve Chapelle"/>

One month later, on [[24 April]], a German offensive began the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. "Second Ypres" was the 4th and [[The Liverpool Rifles|1/6th]] King's first major battle. In the second subsidiary engagement of the offensive, at [[Saint-Julien]], the 4th King's sustained over 400 casualties during a four-day period. The majority, approximately 374, were incurred while supporting the [[4th Gurkha Rifles|1/4th Gurkha Rifles]] on the 27th.<ref>Wyrall (2002), p123</ref> The [[The Liverpool Rifles|1/6th]], meanwhile, supported the [[The Cheshire Regiment|1st Cheshires]] in a small defensive action at [[Battle of Hill 60 (Western Front)|Hill 60]]. After the regiment's involvement in 'Second Ypres' effectively ended, four battalions were engaged in battle at [[Battle of Festubert|Festubert]], collectively sustaining over 1,200 casualties. Lance-Corporal [[Joseph Harcourt Tombs|Tombs]] became the regiment's first Victoria Cross recipient of the war for assisting wounded soldiers during the battle. The [[The Liverpool Scottish|1/10th Battalion]] fought its first battle on [[16 June]], in a "local" action at [[Battle of Bellewaarde|Bellewaarde]]. Losses for the Liverpool Scottish were almost 400 killed, wounded and missing. Of the 24 officers present, only two survived unscathed.<ref>Wyrall (2002), p159</ref>

A new British offensive was launched on [[25 September]] at [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], to coincide with a French offensive in the [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] region. The King's were represented in the offensive by eight battalions, from standard infantry to [[Combat engineering|pioneer]]s. [[Chlorine gas]] was used on the first day of the battle. Strong wind blew the gas backwards, hindering the advance of the 1st King's and others also contending with uncut barbed wire. The 1/9th King's advance also stalled, though they took about 300 Germans prisoner. The battalion was later amongst those who successfully defended against a German counter-attack on [[8 October]].

===1916-1917===
[[Image:Liverpool Scottish Bellewaarde Farm 16 June 1915 Q 49750.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Hooge, [[16 June]] 1915. In the background, the artillery marker planted atop the [[parapet]] was intended to signal to the artillery that the line had been secured.]]
The Liverpool Pals' baptism-of-fire came during "The Big Push" on [[1 July]] [[1916]], on the [[First Day of the Somme|first day of the Somme Offensive]]. The four Pals' battalions of the [[British 30th Division|30th Division]] were to attack towards [[Montauban-de-Picardie|Montauban]], south of where most of the British Army's casualties (nearly 60,000) were sustained on the first day. The 17th, 19th, and 20th Pals formed the 89th Brigade, under Brigader F.C. Stanley. Their fellow Pals battalion, the 18th,  had been detached from the 89th eight-months prior and reassigned to the 21st Brigade.<ref>Maddocks (1991), p208</ref> At 07:30, the 30th Division began its advance on the left of the French [[French XX Corps|Corps de Fer]]. Meeting limited opposition, the Pals completed their objectives with comparatively minimal losses. Grievous losses were, however, incurred by the 18th Battalion when their advance towards the Glatz Redoubt was resisted by heavy machine-gun fire. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Henry Trotter|E.H. Trotter]], killed by a shell on [[8 July]], detailed his battalion's first-day losses: 

{{cquote|I estimate our casualties at about five hundred. I told both officers and men that there were to be no [[SOS]] messages and the [Glatz] redoubt was to be carried by themselves without causing the brigadier to use his reserves, so during the battle the estimates were put at a lower figure than the actual number.<ref>Maddocks (1991), p88</ref>}} 

More battalions entered the fray as reinforcements following the first-day. Some 14 battalions were involved in five attempts to capture the village of [[Guillemont]] between July and September. In the early hours of [[8 August]], the 1st, 1/5th, and 1/8th advanced in conditions that rendered visibility poor.<ref name="Guillemont">Wyrall (2002), pp303-306</ref> The 1st and 1/8th reached the German front-line trenches and entered the village<ref name="Guillemont"/> Their situation deteriorated, however, and the 1/8th's support battalion was driven back by German troops. Contained and isolated by counter-attacks, the 1/8th and three companies of the 1st were surrounded and mostly captured.<ref name="Guillemont"/> Losses were considerable in this third attempt; the 1/8th had suffered 15 killed, 55 wounded, and 502 missing, while the 1st lost its commanding officer, Colonel Goff, and sustained 239 casualties.<ref name="Guillemont"/> The 1st was later reinforced with drafts from the Manchester Regiment. The village was captured on [[3 September]], by which time the 12th King's was the regiment's only representative in the struggle for Guillemont.  

Preparations for combined Allied offensives in April 1917 were not significantly disrupted when the German Army conducted a strategic withdrawal to the "[[Hindenburg Line]]" in northern France.<ref name="Hindenburg">Simkins (2002), ''The First World War'', p17</ref> The phased withdrawal, conducted from February to April, reduced the German front by 25-miles<ref name="Hindenburg"/> To support the ill-fated [[Nivelle Offensive]], British Commonwealth forces were to execute [[Battle of Arras (1917)|an attack]] in the [[Arras]] area from [[9 April]]. Six of the regiment's battalions were active on the first day of the offensive, of which four were Liverpool Pals.<ref name="Arras">Wyrall (2002), pp393-402</ref> The 13th King's completed their objectives and captured nearly 500 prisoners in heavy fighting near [[Tilloy-les-Mofflaines]], but the Liverpool Pals further south were obstructed by uncut barbed wire. The 18th consolidated in front of the wire until relieved on the 10th, while the 19th and 20th were eventually ordered to withdraw having suffered heavy losses within about 100-yards of reaching the wire.<ref name="Arras"/><ref>Maddocks (1993), p149</ref> Casualties for the King's battalions that participated in the first phase of Arras, referred to as the First Battle of the [[Scarpe]], was in excess of 700.<ref name="Arras"/> 

As the offensive progressed in Arras, the Allies prepared to conduct an offensive in the north, in [[Flanders]]. "Third Ypres" (or [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]) was notorious for conditions that reduced the terrain of shell holes and trenches to a quagmire of mud.<ref> Morrow (2005), ''The Great War: An Imperial History'', p192</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/battle_passchendaele.shtml Battle of Passchendaele: 31 July - 6 November 1917], bbc.co.uk. Accessed 13/03/07</ref> Ten of the regiment's battalions were active in the initial phase of the offensive, known as the Battle of Pilkem Ridge ([[31 July]]&ndash;[[2 August]]). Six were situated in the [[Wieltje]] sector with the 55th Division, north of the Liverpool Pals. Their objectives were identified by three coloured lines: Blue, Black and Green. Progress was difficult and the regiment's battalions suffered heavy casualties. Confusion prevailed during the 18th King's and 2nd Wilts' advance through Sanctuary Wood, carried out in darkness.<ref>Wyrall (2002), p494</ref><ref>Maddocks (1993), p163</ref> The three Pals' battalions eventually had to consolidate in front of the 30th Division's initial objective.<ref>Maddocks (1993), p166</ref> In the area that the territorial battalions operated, the first and second objectives were overcome.<ref>Mileham (2000), p123</ref> The King's losses accumulated; by the 3rd, the regiment's casualties were in excess of 1,800. The losses of the Liverpool Irish, which operated in a supporting role during the battle, were the heaviest; 18 officers and 304 other ranks.<ref>Wyrall (2002), p508</ref>

An account by Captain Wurtzburg, 2/6th Liverpool Rifles, described the conditions endured by soldiers in the Ypres area:  

{{cquote|...Those who took part in it will never erase from their minds its many ghastly features, among which the mud and the multitude of dead will stand out pre-eminent. Of the former it must be said that the sodden condition of the ground, though it stopped our advance, certainly prevented many casualties from shell-fire, but at the same time many a wounded man was sucked down into the horrible quagmire and stretcher-bearers found their task in many cases beyond their powers. <ref>Wyrall (2002), p538</ref>}}

===1918===

The war's end in Europe came with the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] on [[11 November]] 1918. The initial reaction of soldiers was illustrated in the 9th King's battalion history:

{{cquote|While on parade on the morning of the 11th November it was announced to the men that the Armistice had been signed. The news of the cessation of hostilities was received by the soldiers without any manifestation of the joy or excitement that marked the occasion at home. The parade continued and the rest of the day was spent quite as usual. The news for which the men had waited so long seemed when it came to be almost too good to be true.}}

Most of the regiment's battalions were disbanded by the end of 1919, the men demobilised and returned to Britain. Many battalions had stayed on the continent or moved to overseas garrisons prior to disbandment. On [[11 December]] 1918, the remnants of the 1st King's, some veterans of 1914, had marched across the German frontier "at ease", bayonets fixed and their colours uncased.<ref>Wyrall, (2000), p703</ref> The battalion was based at [[Düren]] and Berg Neukirchen for about five-months as part of the [[British Army of the Rhine]]. The 13th King's, too, served with the occupation army until disbanded in October 1919.

==Inter-war (1918-1939)==
[[Image:6th King's Regiment, 1931.jpg|thumb|250px|left|C Company of the 6th (Rifle) Battalion at Kinmel Park, near [[Rhyl]], [[Wales]]. Dated July, [[1931]]. The battalion (known as the [[Liverpool Rifles]]) was transferred to the [[Royal Engineers]] five-years later.]]

Hostilities did not end for the 17th King's on [[11 November]]; the battalion had sailed for [[Murmansk]], Russia, in October as part of an Allied intervention force sent to fight alongside the [[White movement|"White" forces]] in [[Russian Civil War|their war]] against the [[Bolshevik]]s. The battalion was moved to [[Archangelsk|Archangel]], where it was based fully intact for a short period. The battalion's companies served separately for the duration of their stay in Russia. The battalion was disbanded in September 1919.

Inter-war reductions and reorganisations reduced the regiment's territorial battalions from six to one by 1937. The 8th disbanded in the early 1920s, the 9th was absorbed by the Royal Engineers, and a reorganisation of the TA's infantry in the mid-1930s resulted in the 6th, 7th, and 10th converting to new roles.<ref>Roberts (1922), [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16974 The Story of the 9th King's in France], p127</ref><ref>Mileham (2000), p138</ref> The 6th became [[Royal Engineers]], the 7th joined the [[Royal Tank Regiment]], and the 10th became a battalion of the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]].

===1st King's===
As Britain's control of Ireland slipped away in 1920 during the [[Irish War of Independence]], the 1st Battalion was deployed to [[Bantry]], [[County Cork]]. The county was a ferment of Republican activity; its supporters were frequently the subject of oppressive measures by British forces to curtail the escalating violence.<ref>Mileham (2000), p131</ref>  Compared to other regiments operating in the county, such as the [[Essex Regiment]], the King's had a favourable reputation among its adversaries for their professionalism and humane treatment of prisoners - this saved the lives of some Kingsmen.<ref name="Ireland">[[Tom Barry|Barry]] (1993), ''Guerilla Days in Ireland'', p99</ref> Their conduct was described by [[Tom Barry]], a prominent [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] leader, as "exemplary in all the circumstances".<ref name="Ireland"/> After the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in the south, the battalion was moved to [[Northern Ireland]], stationed in [[Derry]] and [[Omagh]]. 

A brief deployment to [[Turkey]] as part of the army of occupation occurred in 1923. The battalion returned to England in 1924 and was posted from 1926 to the garrisons in [[Malta]], [[Sudan]], and [[Egypt]]. While much of the battalion's time in Egypt was peaceful and comfortable, they occasionally dealt with [[riot]]ing, and on one occasion a company was deployed to [[Jerusalem]].<ref>Mileham (2000), p133</ref> In 1931, [[Greek Cypriot]]s in [[Cyprus]] uprised demanding [[Foreign relations of Greece#Enosis|union]] with [[Greece]]. Two companies were sent as reinforcements for the British garrison in October; C Company arrived via eight [[Vickers Victoria]] air transports, followed by the sea-transported D Company.

India was the battalion's next posting, based initially in [[Jubbulpore]] from 1932. The battalion was moved to [[Landi Kotal]], [[Khyber Pass]], in 1937. Service in the volatitle [[North-West Frontier Province]] continued into the Second World War.

===2nd King's===
The 2nd Battalion continued to serve in India following the Armistice, and in 1919 was called upon for service in the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War|Third Afghan War]]. Leading a "Special Column", the battalion reached the [[Toba Kakar Range|Toba Plataeu]], some 8,000 feet high, but the war was concluded before the battalion could engage Afghan forces.<ref>Wyrall, (1935/2000), p697</ref>

Demobilisation followed and the remnants joined the [[Sudan]] garrison in 1920, where the battalion was reformed. Postings to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Guangdong|Canton]] occurred in 1922, then a return to India in 1924. and finally [[Iraq]] the following year. Stationed near [[Baghdad]], their stay lasted two-years, uneventful but with the distinction of being the last British battalion to serve there until the Second World War.<ref>Mileham (2000), p133</ref> 

Immediately after their return to England, the 2nd King's became the first battalion of the regiment to undertake [[public duties]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. The battalion was based in various parts of the country for nearly a decade before resuming overseas duties in 1938, when it was posted to [[Gibraltar]].

==World War II (1939-1945)==
[[Image:9th King's Regiment, Sussex, 1941.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Universal Carrier]]s of the 9th King's moving through a [[Sussex]] village, [[3 July]] 1941.]]

Expansion was on a more modest scale to that which occurred during the previous world war. Ten battalions were raised between 1939 and 1940, including the reformed 8th (Irish). Two of these war-raised battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941; the 11th becoming the 152nd Regiment, RAC, and the 12th transferring the Royal Artillery as the 101 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. Some 16 battalions and four [[artillery battery|batteries]] of the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] were affiliated with the King's Regiment. The Lancashire Home Guard performed various duties in Britain supporting the [[Civil Defence Service]] and regular army, and served during the [[Liverpool Blitz]]. 

By late-1941, three battalions of the regiment (1st, 2nd, and 13th) were stationed abroad. The remainder were located throughout the United Kingdom, poised to defend against an invasion. The 1st and 13th would serve in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] as [[Chindits]], the 2nd in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] and [[Greece]], and the 5th and 8th in [[Western Front (WWII)#1944 - 1945|North-West Europe]]. Of battalions that had transferred and converted to other roles pre-war, only the [[40th (The King's) Royal Tank Regiment|40th RTR]] (7th King's) saw active service. With the [[British 23rd Armoured Brigade|23rd Armoured Brigade]], the 40th RTR fought in [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]], where they acquired the nickname "[[Bernard Law Montgomery|Monty's]] Foxhounds", Italy, and Greece. 

===Italy and Greece===
Having spent five-years in [[Gibraltar]], the 2nd King's departed for Egypt in December 1943 to reinforce the [[British 4th Infantry Division|4th Infantry Division]]. The battalion landed in [[Italy]] with the division in March 1944. On [[11 May]], the division conducted an opposed crossing of the [[Rapido River]] during the final [[Battle of Monte Cassino|battle for Monte Cassino]]. The 2nd King's constituted, along with the [[Somerset Light Infantry|2nd Somersets]], the main element of [[British 28th Infantry Brigade|28 Infantry Brigade's]] initial assault. Behind schedule by 35-minutes and consequently lacking artillery support, the battalion attempted to cross the Rapido under heavy mortar and artillery fire.<ref name="Monte Cassino">Ellis (2003), ''Cassino: The Hollow Victory'', pp299-300</ref> Many boats capsized as a result of the strong current and casualties were numerous.<ref name="Monte Cassino"/> The 4th Division collectively struggled to consolidate its bridgehead. A determined defence and minefields inflicted heavy casualties on the King's and their commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Garmons-Williams, was mortally wounded. Depleted and disorganised, the remnants of the bridgehead were withdrawn on the 14th. The 2nd King's had, by then, lost 72 men killed or missing and many wounded.<ref>Graham (2004), ''Tug of War: The Battle for Italy 1943-45'', p179</ref><ref>Mileham (2000), p176</ref>.<ref name="Monte Cassino"/> After a five-month struggle, Monte Cassino was captured on [[18 May]] by the [[Polish II Corps]] and the [[Gustav Line]] broken.  

The Allies captured [[Rome]] in June and the King's fought in the subsequent advance to the [[Lake Trasimeno|Trasimene]] Line. Intense battles were fought in the Gioella area and [[Civitella in Val di Chiana|Tuori]], the latter earning the regiment a unique battle honour in the British Army.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/lancs/history/index.htm The History of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment], <u>army.mod.uk</u></ref> In about nine-months of service, in difficult, mountainous terrain, with heavy casualties, the battalion was awarded four [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], nine [[Military Cross|MCs]], three [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCMs]], four [[Military Medal|MMs]], and six [[mentioned in despatches]].<ref name="Italy"> Mileham (2000), p179 </ref> Among those awarded were Sergeant Welsby, who single-handedly secured a fortified farmhouse, and Major J. A. de V. Reynolds, for his leadership and conduct around Casa Arlotti.<ref name="Italy"> Mileham (2000), p179 </ref>

Conflict in Greece between government forces and [[Communist]] partisans followed the vacuum created by Germany's withdrawal. The partisans ([[ELAS]]) sought to establish themselves as the country's new political authority and had captured significant territory in the [[Attica]] region. The 4th Division was redeployed in December to reinforce the British forces embroiled in a [[Greek Civil War|civil war]]. Flown to [[Piraeus]] on [[12 December]], the 2nd King's were directed to engage partians within 24-hours of their arrival. In a brief action, the battalion seized barracks occupied by partisans at the cost of 14 casualties.<ref name="Greece">Mileham (2000), pp179-180</ref> There were numerous instances of house-to-house and street fighting in [[Athens]] during the battalion's seven-week [[internal security]] employment.<ref name="Greece"/> The city was cleared of insurgents by early January 1945. A ceasefire was agreed upon and the King's remained for a year to support the  maintaining of a tense peace before leaving for [[Cyprus]].

===Burma===
[[Image:Chindit column, Operation Longcloth.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A [[Chindit]] column crossing a river in [[Burma]].]]

The 13th King's sailed for India in December 1941, coinciding with [[Empire of Japan|Japan's]] entrance into the war. Intended for garrisson duties, the battalion's strength contained many men who were of an old or medically downgraded condition.<ref> Mileham (2000), p145</ref> After Burma was occupied by Japan in 1942, a unit was formed to penetrate deep behind Japanese lines from India. The 13th King's provided the majority of the British contingent for the unit, which was designated as the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade (the '[[Chindits]]') and commanded by [[Orde Wingate]]. 

Organised into two groups, the Chindits' first operation (codenamed Longcloth) began on [[8 February]] 1943. No. 2 Group, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel S.A. Cooke, was formed from the 13th King's and divided into five independent columns, two of which (Nos 7 and 8) were commanded by majors from the battalion.<ref>Mileham (2000), p155. Majors Ken Gilkes and Walter 'Scotty' Scott commanded Nos 7 and 8 Columns respectively. Scott would subsequently command the 1st King's in 1944.</ref>  No Japanese opposition was encountered initially, allowing the Chindits to cross the Chindwin River and advance into Burma unimpeded.<ref>(2002), ''The Second World War: Asia and the Pacific'', p216</ref>

===Normandy and Germany===
[[Image:Infantry waiting to move off 'Queen White' Beach.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A group of British infantry waiting to leave [[Sword Beach]], [[6 June]] 1944.]]

In 1943, the 5th and 8th King's (Liverpool Irish) were provided with speciailst training at [[Ayrshire]] in preparation for a planned [[Battle of Normandy|invasion of France]]. They were selected to form the nucleus of the 5th and 7th Beach Groups, whose objectives on an invasion beach were to maintain organisation, secure positions, and provide defence against counter-attack. 

As invasion neared in mid-1944, the two battalions were moved from their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard [[troopship]]s and [[landing ship tank]]s. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the ''Ulster Monarch'', a passenger ship that had served on the [[Belfast]]-Liverpool line before the war.<ref>Fitzsimmons (2004), p44 </ref> After delays, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on [[5 June]]. Both King's battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] with the [[British 3rd Infantry Division]] and the Liverpool Irish at [[Juno Beach|Juno]] with the [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division|Canadians]]. 

Two companies of the Liverpool Irish landed in the assault wave with the [[Royal Winnipeg Rifles]]. Under intense machine gun and mortar fire, the landing of Major Max Morrison's "A" Company proceeded well, allowing some to establish a command-post upon reaching the sand dunes. In contrast, in "B" Company's sector, the late arrival of the reconnaissance party and [[DD tank]]s exposed the landing infantry to heavy machine gun fire. The company's officer commanding, Major O'Brien, and the second-in-comannd were among those wounded. Experiences at Sword Beach were similar. As the 3rd Division moved inland, the 5th King's attempted to neutralise hostile positions and snipers. Casualties included Lieutenant-Colonel D. H. V. Board, killed by a sniper, and the OC of 9 Platoon, Lieutenant Scarfe, mortally wounded in an attack on a German position.

Under fire, the beach groups collected the wounded and dead, located and marked [[minefield]]s, attempted to maintain organisation, and directed vehicles and troops inland.<ref>Mileham (2000), p165</ref> The two battalions operated with the beach groups for a further six weeks. While the depleted Liverpool Irish was disbanded in August, much of its strength having been transferred to other units as reinforcements, the 5th King's was reduced to cadre strength. Disbandment was only avoided through the determination of Lieutenant-Colonel G.D. Wreford-Brown, who argued that the 5th Battalion was nearly the most senior unit active in the Territorial Army. <ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/kings/the_association/5_kings_2_t_force.htm 5 King's/No 2 T Force], <u>army.mod.uk</u></ref>

After the Allies began their advance into Nazi Germany in February 1945, the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) formed dedicaed units to secure important objectives - equipment, installations, intelligence, and personnel.<ref> [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/Occ-GY/ch17.htm Ziemke, ''The U.S. Army in the Occupation of Germany 1944-1946''], p133 army.mil</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/kings/the_association/5_kings_2_t_force.htm 5 King's/No 2 T Force], army.mod.uk</ref> The 5th King's provided the nucleus for one such [[T-Force|T (Target) Force]]. Elements of the 5th King's reached the naval port of [[Kiel]] in May 1945, securing the [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'']] and taking 7,000 German sailors prisoner.<ref> Mileham (2000), p172</ref> The battalion continued to conduct intelligence operations until July 1946, when it was disbanded during the demoblisation process. Reconstitution into the Territorial Army followed in 1947 under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward John Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby|Edward John Stanley]] (later the 18th [[Earl of Derby]]).

==Post-World War II (1945-1958)==

The 1st King's, still roled as parachute infantry, remained in India with responsibility for the area around [[Meerut]], north-east of [[New Delhi]]. After reconverting to the infantry role, the battalion departed for Liverpool in late [[1947]]. 

Meanwhile, the 2nd King's were deployed to [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] for two-weeks. First arriving on [[29 April]] 1948, the battalion carried out security duties just prior to the establishment of [[Israel]]. After returning to Cyprus, the battalion proceeded to [[Liverpool]]. 

On [[6 September]] [[1948]], the two battalions amalgamated in a ceremonial parade attended by honorary Colonel of the Regiment, Major-General [[Dudley Ward]]. The battalion was posted to [[West Germany]] shortly afterwards and moved to [[Spandau]], [[West Berlin]], in 1950.

===Korean War===
[[Image:King's Regiment group, Korea 1952.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Men of "A" Company constructing a [[bunker]] while on the frontline, December 1952.]]

The battalion was ordered to Korea in June 1952. By then, the [[Korean War]] had entered a period of stalemate, with [[trench warfare]] prevailing. At Liverpool, the battalion embarked aboard the troopship ''Devonshire'' for [[Hong Kong]], where it underwent training before landing at [[Pusan]], Korea, in September.  Replacing the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment|1st Royal Norfolk Regiment]] in the [[British 29th Infantry Brigade|29th Infantry Brigade]], [[1st Commonwealth Division]], the 1st King's took up defensive positions upone moving to the frontline. 

Much of the battalion's time at the front was quiet, though their night patrols often resulted in clashes with [[China|Chinese]] troops. The battalion was withdrawn to reserve for three months in 1953. A tactically important feature known as [[Battle for the Hook|"The Hook"]], a crescent shaped ridge, was the scene of intense heavy fighting between Commonwealth forces and the Chinese in May. On the night of [[20 May]], Chinese forces commenced a sustained bombardment of the Hook, defended by the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]]. A company of the King's was ordered to conduct a nighttime diversionary raid on Chinese positions known as "Pheasant" two-days later. Second-Lieutenant Caws' 5 Platoon, intended to execute the actual attack, inadvertently stumbled upon an unchartered [[land mine|minefield]], suffering 10 wounded from a strength of 16.<ref>Barker (1974), ''Fortune Favours the Brave - the Battle of the Hook, Korea, 1953'', p105</ref> The attack was consequently abandoned, forcing the company to withdraw with its wounded back to British lines.<ref name="Korea"> Mileham (2000), p192</ref>

The King's moved onto the right sector of the Hook on [[27 May]], while "D" Company's 10 Platoon and "B" Company (as reserve) were attached to the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. The battle began on [[28 May]], when a heavy bombardment targeted positions held by the Dukes at 7:53 pm. The first wave of Chinese troops was launched against the Duke's positions minutes later, followed by three further waves. Two platoons of the King's were moved forward to reinforce the Point 121 position, which was then attacked by two companies of Chinese infantry. After the attack was repulsed with the assistance of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[artillery]], the Chinese directed their attention to the King's on Point 146. Before the attack began, however, an artillery bombardment destroyed the Chinese formation while it assembled. Fighting continued until the remaining Chinese troops were cleared from positions at approximately 03:30 am.

The 1st King's left Korea for Hong Kong in October, by which time its casualties numbered 28 dead and  200 wounded. Of some 1,500 men that served with the battalion in Korea, 350 were regular soldiers, the rest were [[national service]]men.<ref name="Korea"> Mileham (2000), p192</ref> The King's moved to Britain in 1955, were posted to West Germany the following year, and made its final return home in 1958.

===Amalgamation===

The [[1957 Defence White Paper]] (known as the "Sandys Review" after Secretary of State for War [[Duncan Sandys]]) announced, among others, reductions in the British Army's overseas responsibilities and the abolition of national service.<ref> Chandler (2003), p338 </ref> Regiments and other units were resultingly rationalised through amalgamation or disbandment. The decision to merge the King's and Manchesters was announced to the dismay of many serving and retired personnel.<ref>Mileham (2000), p193</ref> Both, however, shared an historical connection through the [[63rd Regiment of Foot|63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot]], constituted as the 8th Foot's second battalion in 1756 and redesginated the 1st Battalion, Manchester Regiment in 1881.

In June, at [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], the colours of the two regiments were paraded for the last time in the presence of [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother]]. The '''[[The King's Regiment|King's Regiment (Manchester and Liverpool)]]''' formally came into being on [[1 September]] [[1958]]. On [[1 July]] 2006, the successor regiment amalgamated, joining with two others to form the [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]. 

The surviving territorial battalion of the King's (Liverpool), the 5th, retained its identity until reduced to "B" Company, [[Lancastrian Volunteers]] in 1967. The lineage of 5th King's has  been perpuated by "A" Company since its formation in 1992.<ref>Mills, [http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/la-K5.htm   5th Battalion, The King's Regiment], regiments.org. Accessed [[21 April]] 2007.</ref> The company became an integral component of the 4th Battalion, Duke of Lancaster's Regiment in 2006. Contained within the company is the Liverpool Scottish Platoon.
