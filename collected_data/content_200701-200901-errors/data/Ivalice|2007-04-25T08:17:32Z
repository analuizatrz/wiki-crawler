{{Final Fantasy locations}}
{{nihongo|'''Ivalice'''|イヴァリース|Ivarīsu}} is a fictional location in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' and ''[[Vagrant Story]]'' universes. The world was conceived by [[Yasumi Matsuno]] when he joined [[Square Co., Ltd.]] (now [[Square Enix|Square Enix Co., Ltd.]]) in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], and has since been expanded upon by several games, with more yet due with the [[Ivalice Alliance]] series. Ivalice is described as a complex world with a very long history, and the stories of ''Vagrant Story'', ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', and ''Final Fantasy XII'' are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map.<ref>[http://www.ffworld.com/?rub=ff12&page=interview_jp-mai04 Interview - Yasumi Matsuno]</ref> 

Though described often as a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'', in which Ivalice was created parallel to the 'real' world. The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region,<ref name="ivalice"> Ivalice (Sage Knowledge 29 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> and a smaller [[kingdom]], both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice is also used to refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say "the world of [[medieval Europe]]."

==Overview==
<!--
A small description of Ivalice in the games.
-->
Ivalice has featured in four Square Enix games as of early 2007; ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' and, most recently, ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''. It also featured to a much lesser extent in ''[[Vagrant Story]]''. This fictional world was created by Yasumi Matsuno with its own identity; a medieval-like world where magic and machine exist together; with usual elements of ''Final Fantasy''; such as Chocobos, Crystals and magic spells, blended into its setting.

;''Final Fantasy Tactics''
The kingdom Ivalice neighbors the kingdom of Romanda in the northwest, separated by Larner Channel sea, and the kingdom of Ordalia at the east. Only Humans populate the area, and even though magic is prominent, airships have ceased to exist following a mysterious catastrophe. The worldview is similar to medieval England, with the Glabados Church a prominent religious entity.

;''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance''
The protagonist lives in a town named St. Ivalice, an area mirroring the modern world located at a four-seasoned region. Following the characters' discovery of the book called the Gran Grimoire, St. Ivalice was transformed into the kingdom of Ivalice, mirroring a ''Final Fantasy'' game.<ref>'''Mewt''': I love Final Fantasy, that's my favorite.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics Advance |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=GameBoy Advance |language=English}}</ref> The game is confirmed to be ''Final Fantasy XII'' due to existence of the races that inhabit the game; Bangaa, Moogle, Viera and Nu Mou.

;''Final Fantasy XII'' & ''Revenant Wings''
Ivalice covers three continents, Ordalia, Valendia and Kerwon. The demography consists of the known races: Humes, Bangaa, Viera, Seeq and Moogle, and other sub-races. Civilization is advanced in this world where the use of magical stone called magicite is extensive in everyday life, airships are a prominent transportation and multi-storey buildings cover the cityscape.

Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy XII'' is designed based on a mixture of cultures. According to the game developers, these designs are inspired from a mixture of medieval Mediterranean countries,<ref>{{cite web | author=Hirohiko Niizumi| year=November 19, 2003| title=Final Fantasy XII gets star treatment in Tokyo| format= | work= | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/news.html?sid=6083932 | accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> Turkish architecture,<ref name="Q&A">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff| year=November 20, 2003| title=Final Fantasy XII Q&A (page 2 of 4)| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p2.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> art-deco from India,<ref name="ffshrine">{{cite web | author= | year=November 19, 2003| title=Final Fantasy XII Interview| format= | work= | url=http://www.ffshrine.org/ffxii/ff12_interview.php| accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> the cityscape of New York<ref name="Q&A"/> and the Arabic culture found hidden in European countries.

==Timeline==
<!--
Timeline. No trivia.
-->
[[Image:Ivalice-time.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The timeline of ''Final Fantasy XII'' as compared to ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.]]
The timeline of Ivalice as presented in the games was left quite vague, and formerly other official sources had said little on the matter. A few venerable sources have made their own conclusion on the timeline of Ivalice.<ref name=GameSpot>{{cite web | author=Matthew Rorie|date=2006-09-23| title=TGS 06: ''Final Fantasy XII'' Q&A| work=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/news.html?sid=6158485 | accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref><ref>[http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=7630629&publicUserId=5624991 ''Final Fantasy XII'' Review]</ref> The official timeline, however, was eventually given in the ''Final Fantasy XII'' [[Ultimania]] Omega, and placed the events of ''Final Fantasy XII'' before those ''Final Fantasy Tactics''. This would seem to place ''Vagrant Story'' latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.

Some confusion still persists, particularly due to the facts surrounding Saint Ajora, who was executed 1200 years prior to the events of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'',<ref name="ajora">Born around twelve centuries ago in Bervenia of Lesalia.  Raised in Milodos.  Spoke of the arrival of a kingdom of a higher source, as feelings of anitpathy grew from Father Fara.  Executed as a traitor by the Holy Empire of Yudora.  Soon after, the capital of the Church of Fara became submerged under the sea by an extraordinary natural phenomenon.  Those disciples of Ajora believed this was his miracle.  As these stories spread, the Glabados Church became what it is today. {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy Tactics]] |developer=[[Squaresoft Inc]] |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> yet in the Clan Primer of ''Final Fantasy XII'' is said to have separated from the Light of Kiltia religion shortly after its foundation, already two thousand years old.<ref name="magickpot"> The Light of Kilita (Sage Knowledge 7 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary <br>"The Light of Kiltia - Religion begun by the prophet Kiltia over two millennia ago. The religion of the Ordalian people is a dualist system--a polytheistic pantheon with the God of Light, Faram the Father, at its head. After embarking on a pilgrimage to proselytize and deliver the word of the vision he had seen to the people, Kiltia came to Mt Bur-Omisace, and from there his teachings spread. The Light of Kiltia, as his teachings were called, continued even after his death, until they covered all Ivalice. Though the followers and churches of Kiltia are spread far and wide, they do not interfere in affairs of state or governance. Though at one point the church held considerable influence, they willingly discarded that power, fearing oppression. Ever since, the church officials with the rank of celebrant or higher have been forbidden from participating in statecraft. In addition, Mt. Bur-Omisace maintains a mutual non-incursion policy with the surrounding territories. Several years after Kiltia's founding, Saint Ajora began a new teaching, claiming that Faram alone was the one true god, the popularity of this new sect further lessening the power of the Light."<br> {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-10 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> This contradiction, however, appears to be unique to the localized versions of the game, the original being more vague as to the time of Ajora’s coming. Even so, the “cache of Glabados” is mentioned in the ending of ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', despite the game being set before Ajora’s founding of the religion.

To further the confusion, [[Balthier]] is set to appear in the PSP port of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Shishi Sensō]]'', apparently searching for the cache. 

==History==

The prehistory of Ivalice is one of myths and legends, involving [[Ivalice#Mythology|god]]s and magical creatures. Events during this age are unclear, though tales of a war between the gods and their [[Ivalice#Espers|Esper]] progeny, as well as between the gods and wyrms (here used to refer to both [[dragon]]s and [[dinosaur]]ian creatures), are consistently recounted.<ref name="Espers"> Espers section, Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref><ref name="wyrmkin"> Wild Saurian, Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> It is known that, at an unidentified point in Ivalice history, the gods withdrew from overt interference in worldly affairs and retreated to a city of their making.<ref name="ult_omega" />

===''Final Fantasy XII''===

;The Galtean Alliance

Though apparently withdrawn from history, the Occurian gods of Ivalice continued to influence its course. Prior to ''Final Fantasy XII'', their most recent action was the gifting of [[Ivalice#Mist|nethicite]] to King Raithwall, a Valendia-born man who would, with this Occurian aid, unite all of Ivalice, bringing it from a time of turmoil into a [[Golden Age]]. Around four centuries prior to the game, this Alliance finally dissolved, splintering into its component countries.<ref name="Galtea"> The Age of King Raithwall (Sage Knowledge 2 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Dalmasca, founded shortly after Raithwall’s campaign, survived the Alliance, and its ruling House Dalmasca remained a branch of Raithwall’s bloodline.<ref name="Dalmasca"> The Kingdom of Dalmasca (Sage Knowledge 34 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> The ancient city of Rabanastre on the Galtean Peninsula became Dalmasca’s capital, and House Nabradia meanwhile settled in Valendia, the king's home continent.<ref name="Rabanastre"> Rabanastre (Sage Knowledge 39 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref><ref name="Galtea"> The Kingdom of Nabradia (Sage Knowledge 35 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Each cared for one of the three shards of nethicite used by Raithwall, which served as proof of their lineage.

;Present

As of the year 704 Old Valendian, as measured from the founding of the Galtean Alliance, the recent history of Ivalice has been one of conquest. In that year, the ever-expanding Archadian Empire devoured its neighbor, the kingdom of Nabradia, obliterating its royal seat at the Verdpale Palace with the power of Raithwall's nethicite legacy, stolen from the palace.<ref name="midlight"> The Tragedy of Nabudis (Sage Knowledge 3 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Archadia's efforts soon turned Dalmasca’s way, and it was quickly conquered, its king murdered in an Archadian plot to deny Dalmasca the luxury of a peace treaty.

Driven from her kingdom and pronounced dead, [[Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca]], now [[government in exile|queen in exile]] of Dalmasca, joined a [[resistance movement]] dedicated to restoring Dalmascan sovereignty. In 706OV, her path merged with others who held grievances towards the Archadian Empire, and together they discovered the full extent of Archadia's want for conquest, eventually managing to avoid the threat of war with Rozarria, an empire in Ordalia. The events of Ashe's journey saw the Occurian control over history broken and Venat, the rogue Occurian responsible for granting Archadia so much power, satisfied that his goals had been fulfilled. The Archadian Empire was left in the hands of [[Larsa Solidor]], a peaceable young man who saw the hope of Ivalice in co-operation. A new level of freedom was granted to Ivalice.<ref name="ffxii">{{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

;Post 706

An unknown span of time after the events of '''Final Fantasy XII'', the female [[saint]] Ajora was born, and later founded a new religion, which became the dominant religion of the Kingdom of Ivalice. At some point following this, a mysterious cataclysm befell Ivalice as a whole, destroying airships and other forms of technology. With some forms of technology already limited by various factors,<ref name="jagd" /><ref name="travel"> Terrestrial Conveyances (Sage Knowledge 10 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> the loss of airships came as a crippling blow to Ivalice civilization, regressing it by several hundred years.<ref name="ulti" /> Remarkably, this was not the first occurrence of such regression in Ivalice.<ref name="ancients"> Mysteries of the Ancients 1 of 2, Clan Primer Bestiary {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

===''Final Fantasy Tactics''===

;The Kingdom of Ivalice

Legend has it that, at an unknown point in the history of the Ordalian continent, seven city-states warred with each other for conquest of a western peninsula. A king born to Murond eventually mustered an army strong enough to conquer the peninsula, but the way to victory proved long, and so he summoned a powerful entity to do his bidding. The entity killed the king, and was in turn slain by thirteen warriors, who gathered together the powerful 'zodiac stones' and slew the evil. This became known as the Zodiac Brave Legend.<ref name="fara" /> The seven states were, at some point, united to form the Kingdom of Ivalice (not to be confused with the region of the same name), and this kingdom would later be the setting for ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.

;50 Years War

1200 years after Ajora's life, and an unknown length of time after the cataclysm, Ivalice society had come to resemble that of [[medieval Europe]]. The Glabados church, founded by Ajora, was now dominant, and a [[feudal system]] in place.

Shortly prior to ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', the Kingdom of Ivalice went to war with Ordalia, its neighbor. Romanda, a country to the northwest of Ivalice, also entered the fray, assaulting the weakened Ivalice. The war ended after almost 50 years of conflict, with a treaty signed between Ivalice and Ordalia, Romanda having earlier withdrawn due to plague.

;The Lion War

''Final Fantasy Tactics'' introduced a subsequent conflict, where the sudden passing of the king of Ivalice sparked a [[civil war]]. Prince Goltana of the Black Lion and Prince Larg of the White Lion struggle first through politics and later through open warfare for the rights to the throne. The kidnapping of Princess Ovelia, a supposed heir to the throne, adds to the conflict, and the church of Glabados also involves itself politically. Delita Hyral, common-born but future king of Ivalice, manipulates the situation to his advantage, ending the war and marrying the Princess Ovelia, the two becoming king and queen.

;Present

{{seealso| List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters}}

Parallel to this, Ramza Beoulve, childhood friend of Delita, is embroiled in the struggles of the Lion War. Eventually he comes to discover the inherent corruption of the Glabados church at the hands of the [[Lucavi]] demons. Branded a heretic for his actions against the church (but which ultimately save Ivalice), he is stricken from historical records. His story is unearthed some 400 years later, by the historian Alazlam J. Durai, descendent of a travelling companion of Ramza, Olan Durai.

===''Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings'' ===
[[Image:RWLemures.JPG|thumb|right|The ''Purvama'' Lemurés]]
A few locations in the Ivalice of ''Final Fantasy XII'' return in ''Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings'', along with a new setting: Lemurés. A legendary ''Purvama'' (Floating Continent) raised into the skies by the god Falsanos long ago, this land is ruled by a magical stone known as the “Sacred Crystal” which erected a barrier to shield the Purvama from the rest of the world. In time, the “Legend of the Floating Land” became an ambition for Sky Pirates who seek the island and what riches are on it. The ruins of Lemurés are where the [[Ivalice#Demography|Aegyl]] reside.

===''Final Fantasy Tactics''===
[[Image:FFTIvalice.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.]]
''Final Fantasy Tactics'' takes place in the [[monarch]]ic [[empire]] of Ivalice, itself a part of the larger Ivalice region.<ref>[http://www.ffworld.com/?rub=ff12&page=interview_jp-mai04 Interview - Yasumi Matsuno]</ref> The kingdom borders Ordalia in the east, and the island nation of Romanda in the north-west, from which it is seperated by the Larner Channel. As a [[peninsula]] nation, Ivalice is also surrounded by several seas. The kingdom is composed of seven provinces, formerly individual kingdoms prior to their unification: Gallione, Lionel, Lesalia, Fovoham, Limberry, Zeltennia and Murond. 

At the western end of the kingdom, the province of Gallione is ruled by [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Prince Bestrada Larg|Prince Bestrada Larg]]. Igros Castle, capital of the province, is home to the Hokuten Knights and [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Ramza Beoulve|Ramza Beoulve]]'s family. The Royal Academy of Magic is located in the Magic City Gariland. [[Races of Final Fantasy#Moogles|Moogles]] once lived in Sweegy Woods before going extinct.

The ecclesiastical province of Lionel is located on a peninsula on the southern part of the kingdom. It is the place where [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Saint Ajora Glabados / Altima|Saint Ajora]] was executed twelve centuries before the events of the game. [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Cardinal Alphons Draclau / Queklain|Cardinal Alphons Draclau]], second in the Glabados Church, rules this province. Many ruins of an ancient, advanced civilization are excavated in the undergrounds of the insular Goug Machine City. An abandoned lighthouse in the East Bugross Sea leads to the mysterious Deep Dungeon.

The Imperial province of Lesalia, located on the central region of the kingdom, houses the capital Lesalia and the royal family Atkascha. It is a highland presenting several hills and plateaus, as well as the largest active volcano in the kingdom. The city of Bervenia, though located in this province, is governed by the Murond Glabados Church, as it was the birthplace of Saint Ajora.

The province of Fovoham is located at the northernmost part of the kingdom. Its capital is Riovanes Castle, home to [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Grand Duke Gelkanis Barinten|Grand Duke Gelkanis Barinten]]. The country of Romanda is located northwest of Fovoham, across the Larner Channel.

The province of Limberry is located on the southeastern part of the kingdom. It is ruled by [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Marquis Mesdoram Elmdor / Zalera|Marquis Mesdoram Elmdor]]. It is essentially a lowland of swamps and lakes.

At the eastern end of the kingdom, the province of Zeltennia is ruled by [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Prince Druksmald Goltana|Prince Druksmald Goltana]]. It is home to the Nanten Knights led by [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Cidolfas Orlandu|Cidolfas Orlandu]]. The province presents mountainous landscapes. The country of Ordalia, rival to the kingdom of Ivalice, is located east of Zeltennia.

The ecclesiastical province of Murond is located south of Gallione, on a small island of the Black Coral Sea. It is the center of the Glabados Church and is directly ruled by High Priest Marge Funeral. The province was larger in the past but most of it was submerged by a disaster after the execution of Saint Ajora. A remaining passage leading to Murond Death City was subsequently sealed in the undergrounds of the Orbonne Monastery.

==Demography==
The {{nihongo|'''Aegyl'''|エグル|Eguru}}　are a humanoid race that debut in ''[[Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings]]'', possessing wings that sprout from their backs.  These wings count as both a blessing (able to fly in the air) and a curse (resulting in a lifespan of 40 years).  The Aegyl dwell in the ruins of ''Purvama'' Lemurés.  They are a people with no true conflict amongst themselves, but there are a few who tend to go against the will of their people; such as Lluyd.

The {{nihongo|'''Baknamy'''|バクナムス|Bakunamusu}} are a green-skinned humanoid race that looks similar to goblins.  Their bodies are relatively small in stature; even as an adult, their height is only the size of a child [[Races of Final Fantasy#Hume|Hume]].  After the kingdom of Nabradia ceased to exist, they designated the Necrohol of Nabudis as their stronghold.  The Baknamy are sensitive to the air that they breathe, and living in the Necrohol of Nabudis where the air is polluted due to the city's destruction forces them to wear gas masks.  The poorer and less fortunate Baknamy commit crimes to earn a living, targeting adventurers and travelers, causing Humes to view them as a despicable race.

[[Image:Bangaa-ffta.jpg|150px|right|Bangaa race art from Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]
The {{nihongo|'''Bangaa'''|バンガ|Banga}} are a reptilian race appearing in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''.  They are separated into four main sub-branches according to the color of their skin: ''Bangaa Rugua'' (yellow-brown), ''Bangaa Fierce'' (bronze), ''Bangaa Bista'' (reddish-brown), and ''Bangaa Sanga'' (ash-colored).  These colorations have been associated with their personality and physical abilities; as an example, the ''Bangaa Ruaga'' are said to be intelligent and friendly. However, since many Bangaa are of mixed blood, this theory is not applied by the start of ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' and ''Final Fantasy XII''.<ref name="BRADY">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 }}</ref>  Their level of intelligence is comparable to that of Humes, though they live almost twice as long.  Being a very socially and cognitively advanced species, they hate being called "[[lizards]]" as this is regarded as an offensive slur.  Bangaa in ''Final Fantasy XII'' are often considered to be the most integrated of all races into Hume society, and are the race most friendly with the Humes.  The character Migelo, who raised Vaan and Penelo, is a Bangaa with blue skin.  In addition, Bangaa possess great agility and strength, and acute senses of hearing and smell, making them excellent hunters and fighters.  However, their eyesight is so poor that some wear blindfolds as part of their clothing.  Their magical abilities, however, are significantly less developed than those of [[Races of Final Fantasy#Hume|Humes]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Nu Mou|Nu Mou]], and [[Races of Final Fantasy#Moogle|Moogles]], due to problems their unique mouth gives them when chanting magic spells.  To make up for this, some Bangaa have developed Bangaa-only, exclusive higher-level spells for the race to use.  As they are best suited to physical forms of work, Bangaa are usually employed as soldiers or manual laborers and have been relegated to a lower social status than Humes.

The {{nihongo|'''Garif'''|ガリフ|Garifu}}　of ''Final Fantasy XII'' are depicted as appreciators of nature. Their size and stature is larger than normal Humes, and their well-built bodies are covered in thick fur.  They also have superior [[olfactory]] and [[auditory]] senses, which make them able hunters.  The Garif value the arts of war, but dislike unnecessary violence.  Scattered throughout the Bancour Region of [[Ivalice]], the Garif villages are sparsely located.  Each village is governed by a council of Elders led by a [[patriarchy|High Elder]].  Relations with other races are particularly peaceful, although it is not usual for a member of another race to be in their land.  Garif merchants are known to trade with the nomads of Giza Plains and the Dalmascans, exchanging items such as Bancour spices.  The Garif prefer to adorn themselves with natural ornaments of animal bones and stones over crafted objects.  Some question the Hume usage of machines in their everyday lives.  However, the only exception is the crafted masks; each Garif is given a mask to be worn from the day they were born until the end of their lives.  The Garif worshipped and kept knowledge of Nethicite; their legends were passed down through generations - in ancient times the [[Races of Final Fantasy#Occuria|Occuria]] granted them Nethicite, however the Garif's dislike for violence hindered them from utilizing its power, much to the Occuria's disappointment. 

The {{nihongo|'''Helgas'''|ヘルガス|Herugasu}} are a long-living race whose intelligence highly surpasses that of Humes.  Helgas are tall and thin, and along with white hair, their special features that differentiate them from Humes are their long limbs.  The Helgas are able to not only communicate telepathically while asleep, but can also probe into the dreams of others.  [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Other important characters|Gran Kiltias Anastasis]] is the only Helgas that appeared within ''Final Fantasy XII''.

[[Image:FFXIIHume.JPG|right|200px|Humans or Humes of ''Final Fantasy XII'']]
'''[[Human|Humes]]''' do not have any overwhelming skill in magic or in fighting, but are suited to fit into whatever role they are needed in. Like most humans in fantasy fiction, they are described as an ethnically and politically diverse species.

The '''Lucavi'''/'''Rukavi''' are a group of [[demon]]s from ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''. They also appear in ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', where they are called Espers.  They are linked to the world through the twelve [[Zodiac]] Stones.  Any person who holds a Zodiac Stone in his possession may make a contract with the Lucavi demon associated with that Zodiac Stone, and in doing so, become one with that Lucavi.  The resulting creature can transform between man and demon at will by using the Zodiac Stone.  The primary objective of the Lucavi is resurrect their banished leader [[Altima]], whose presence in [[Ivalice]] would allow the Lucavi to exist there without mortal host bodies.  Hashmalum, in the form of Vormav Tingel, leads the effort to accomplish this.  To resurrect Altima, there must have been a great deal of bloodshed since the time when [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters|St. Ajora]] (Altima's host) died.  To accomplish this, they secretly help the Murond Glabados Church (also linked to Ajora) mastermind the [[Lion War]], in hopes that the casualties it creates will be enough to make the difference.  In addition, Altima/Ajora needs a new host body, and the only eligible candidate is [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters|Alma Beoulve]], the sister of the hero [[Ramza]].  Finally, the resurrection itself can only take place at [[Ivalice|Murond Death City]], which is only accessible by a hidden gateway.  Hashmalum must locate this gateway, but this is not much of a problem since the Glabados [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters|High Priest Marge Funeral]] knows of its location.  Also among the Lucavi's goals is the possession of all twelve Zodiac Stones (especially Virgo since this is the stone associated with Altima).  In addition, they seek to eliminate Ramza Beoulve, who becomes a threat to their other objectives, especially as he possesses the Germonik Scriptures, which reveal the truth about the [[Zodiac]] Braves.  Some of the Lucavi reappear as Totema in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]''; Adrammelech is based on Adramelk, and Ultima is based on Altima. All of them also appear as [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|Espers]] in ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''.  A subboss in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'', Gukko, becomes a Rukavi before his final encounter with the party, with an appearance similar to that of a vampire-type enemy. This would seem to imply that he is hosting Zalera.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Image:FF12NuMou.jpg|150px|right|A Nu Mou from ''Final Fantasy XII - PS2'']]
The {{nihongo|'''Nu Mou'''|ン・モゥ|N Mou}}　are a mix of otter and gorilla-like species from ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' that are talented in the magical fields. In ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' they are also known to be able to speak with monsters.  Their jobs include Alchemist, Beastmaster, Black Mage, Illusionist, Morpher, Sage, Time Mage, and White Mage.  The two most famous Nu Mous are Babus Swain (Rune Seeker) and Ezel Berbier (Hermetic); both of them appeared as optional playable characters in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance''.   In ''Final Fantasy XII'', the Nu Mou appeared like their counterpart in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', however they play smaller roles. The Nu Mou's lifespan is described to be three times longer than that of a [[Races of Final Fantasy#Humans|Hume]]. They are short and hunched; half the size of an adult Hume, and are more adept in magic. Most of the Nu Mou appear in-game as acolytes of the Kiltia religion, found mainly in Mt. Bur-Omisace; save for Rabanastre and Nabradia.

The {{nihongo|'''Occuria'''|オキューリア|Okyūria}}　are immortal beings, often called (by both themselves and others) "the Undying". Referred to by some as gods, but unknown to the major religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a vital role in the history of Ivalice such as the creation of the Espers. The Occuria and their leader, Gerun, desired control of the history and future of Ivalice. Unable to directly manipulate Ivalice, they instead created the Sun-Cryst, the source of all Nethicite, with the intent of using "chosen ones" as the "fist" with which they would shape the world as they envisioned. They initially gave the stones to the Garif, who did not know how to use them.  In appearance, the Occuria have no visible faces, only a pair of glowing yellow eyes seen under their floating shell-like armor. The Occuria can become invisible to all but those they favor. They also possess the ability of possession and can also assume a form their target is familiar with. Their standard appearance, though, is recognizable in the Final Fantasy series.  Their featureless faces and bright, glowing eyes mimic those of the standard [[Black Mage]].

The {{nihongo|'''Rebe'''|レベ|Rebe}} are a minor race of ''Final Fantasy XII'' that appears in Skycity Bhujerba. Evolved from felines, they are deeply cultured and a bit aristocratic. They act as advisors and representatives for [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters|Marquis Halim Ondore the IV]].

The {{nihongo|'''Seeq'''|シーク|Shīku}} are a porcine race in ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''.  Despite amazing upper-body strength, powerful defense, and surprisingly speedy movement for such a bulky race, the Seeq have low intellect and are described as barely able to speak human languages.  However, ''Final Fantasy XII'' shows no real distinction between Seeq, Bangaa, or Hume characters, with all three races living in relative peace together in Rabanastre and areas outside of Archades.  Though somewhat cowardly, due to their incredible physical ability, they are often hired as mercenaries, guards, or hunters, with a significant amount going into thievery.  The Seeq are also attracted by shiny objects, often adorning themselves with such, sometimes to ridiculous lengths.

The {{nihongo|'''Urutan-Yensa'''|ウルタン＝エンサ|Urutan-Ensa}} are the "Lords and Masters of the Great Sea", a name bestowed befitting their presence in the Yensa Sandsea. The Urutan-Yensa are strictly territorial, attacking anyone who enters their land, including other tribes of their kind. Evolved from crustaceans, their bodies are thin and entirely covered by layers of clothing, which the bestiary states is either to hide their ugly bodies or to keep themselves protected from the sun. Their speech is usually incomprehensible, and attempts of befriending them have been met with failure. They prefer to wield simple bows and smallswords as compared to complicated instruments and machines. They had, however, learned to tame the Yensa Ichtions that dwell within the Sandsea, using them to travel great distances. They also fear the titantoises called Emeralditans, which they call "Urutan Eaters".  The Urutan-Yensa are divided into different tribes, each ruled by a queen, the only one able to speak, and each Urutan-Yensa is extremely proud of their heritage; it is a shame for an Urutan-Yensa to show any form of weakness, like asking the aid of others, with only death as the fitting punishment for the disgrace and restore honor to the entire tribe. Though Urutan-Yensa appear cruel, they can show mercy to few outside their race, but only so that others who dare wander in their domain will learn to know that the Urutan-Yensa are to be feared and respected. They are also known to exile members that show unusual aggressive and violent nature, known as the Urutan-Exile.

[[Image:Fran.jpg|200px|right|Fran, a Viera from ''Final Fantasy XII'']]
The {{nihongo|'''Viera'''|ヴィエラ|Viera}} are a mostly female character race in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''. The Viera possess long life, three times as long as a Human life, and are divided into two sub races: The light-skinned Veena and dark-skinned Rava. The Viera have rabbit or deer-like features, most notably their long ears. Their slender forms and long ears heighten their senses and speed, and although their defense is low, Viera agility and finesse are unmatched by any other race.  In fact, Viera can listen to the surrounding nature and sense Mist, and can sometimes go berserk from feeling an overwhelmingly vast quantity of active Mist. Piercings on the ears seem to be very common as they appear on all official [[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance|''Tactics Advance'']] pictures of Viera. In ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', Vieras have blue-white or purple-white hair, with only a few having hair that is pure white, which is considered to be a blessing. In ''Final Fantasy XII'', they live in hidden villages deep within the vast forests of Ivalice, one such area is Eruyt village deep within the Golmore Jungle. The Viera believed themselves to be intimately tied to the "Wood", a part of the very forests themselves and are rarely involved in matters outside the wood. Mixed breeds of Veena and Rava Viera have accustomed themselves to coexist within Hume society, dyeing their white hair, while the pure-blooded ones remain in the forest, caring not for the outside world and learning of it through listening to the "voice of the Wood" with their ears. A Viera that moves out of the forest, like [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Fran|Fran]], is considered an outcast and dead to her people. However, as Archadian forces began to level many forests, the number of Viera leaving the wood slightly increased.

==Mythology==
<!--
A section in which to address magic, Mist, nethicite, the Occura &C., in the manner of the Spira article.
-->
===''Final Fantasy XII''===
In the [[high fantasy]] tradition, ''Final Fantasy XII'''s world is littered with fantasy elements that directly or otherwise influence life in Ivalice. This influence ranges from transportation, magic, religion and faith to the history of the region. The most significant fantastical element in ''Final Fantasy XII'' is the existence of ''Mist'', the source of magic, which is so present that magic has replaced electricity in Ivalice by the time of ''Final Fantasy XII''.

;Mist
The phenomena of magic - spelt as magick in both ''Final Fantasy XII'' and, intermittently, ''Vagrant Story'' - exists due to the presence of ''Mist'' (distinct from the [[mist|weather phenomenon]]), a naturally occurring energy found around the world that influences the environment and all living things. Mist concentrations differ in every region in Ivalice, with the continent of Kerwon having the highest concentration of Mist, though this can also vary on a smaller scale; in areas where Espers are bound, or in mines that contain magicite, Mist is concentrated regardless of the norm of the region at large. Heavy Mist concentrations are visible to the naked eye, appearing as a reflective, prismatic fog or light streaks that warp the surrounding air. Heavy Mist negatively effects the environment by invoking violent behavior in beasts and sudden changes to the climate, though such concentrations equally allow powerful magic to be performed, and so can be seen as advantageous.

Mist is responsible for the existence of ''magicite'', stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that are installed into a component known as ''glossair rings'' that give flight to the vehicles in Ivalice, whether small-sized bikes or large airships, and memstones that function much like [[recording]] devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone. Without Mist, magicite is nothing more than an ordinary rock. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its cost-efficiency, led to it replacing [[electricity]] and its various sources as the dominant useable energy in Ivalice.

Nethicite, another type of magicite, works by absorbing Mist. Due to this, nethicite is known to nullify the effects of magic, as well as to store vast amounts of power. Nethicite can be described as either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or [[man-made]]). Deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, the ultimate source of which is the Sun-Cryst. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice. Manufacted nethicite is artificial nethicite created in the labs of Draklor under the direction of Dr. Cid.

Areas of Mist-laden winds and magicite-rich soil are known as Jagd ([[German language|German]] for ‘the hunt’), and are recognized as frontier regions, as they preclude proper skystone operation (and thus [[air superiority]], which is integral to war in Ivalice).

;Esper
'''Espers''' are magical beings once created by the Occuria{{Fact|date=April 2007}}; "scions of darkness" that were given great strength and intelligence. Believing themselves to be more powerful than their creators, they rebelled, driven either by dissatisfaction, as exhibited by the Esper Belias, or lust of power, as exhibited by the Esper Ultima. Following this, the Espers engaged themselves in a war against the Occuria, dubbed the Thousand Year War, led by the esper Ultima, but they were eventually defeated. Consequently, the Occuria bound their existence with the Glyph of the Beast, trapping them within the Mist. Any who controls the Glyph in turn controls the Esper, allowing them to operate as [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|summoned creatures]]. There are thirteen Espers, each representing the twelve [[Zodiac]] constellations and the additional [[Ophiuchus|Serpentarius]].

;Occuria
The ''Occuria'' are immortal beings, often called (by both themselves and others) "the Undying". Referred to by some as gods, but unknown to the major religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a vital role in the history of the region, such as in the creation of the Espers{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. The Occuria and their leader, Gerun, controlled the history and future of Ivalice. 

Unable{{Fact|date=April 2007}} (or unwilling) to directly manipulate Ivalice, they instead created{{Fact|date=April 2007}} the Sun-Cryst, the source of all Nethicite, with the intent of using "chosen ones" as the "fist" with which they would shape the world as they envisioned. They initially gave the stones to the garif, who did not know how to use them; seeking someone who could, they found the perfect candidate in a hume future generations would know as the Dynast-King Raithwall. Raithwall cut three shards of Nethicite from the Sun-Cryst - Dawn, Dusk, and Midlight. Using these he conquered Ivalice, just as the Occuria had wanted, forming the Galtean Alliance in the process. Though peace fostered in Ivalice in the subsequent four-hundred year rule, dissension in the small group of Occuria grew. Venat, apparently disgusted with the Occuria, left its kind and used Archadia to develop artificial Nethicite to overthrow their control by making mankind the masters of their own fate. Gerun and other Occuria decided to use Ashe to destroy the Empire, as she was Raithwall's descendant, and a fitting Chosen, however, Ashe resisted them, and attempted to destroy the Sun-Cryst with the sword they gave her. However, it was Reddas who destroyed the Cryst at the cost of his life. Because all deifacted nethicite originated from, and was empowered by the Sun-Cryst, destroying it effectively ended the ‘Age of Stones’; the Occuria's control over Ivalice.

In appearance, the Occuria have no visible faces, only a pair of glowing yellow eyes seen under their floating shell-like armor, surrounded by an aquamarine aura. The Occuria can become selectively invisible, and also possess the ability of possession, shape-shifting and image projection. Their standard appearance, though, is recognizable in the ''Final Fantasy'' series; their featureless faces and bright, glowing eyes mimic those of the standard [[Black Mage]]. Venat, perhaps due to his rebellion, possess an aura of a different color than the other Occuria.

===''Final Fantasy Tactics''===

;Zodiac Brave Story
Within the game, legends revolve around the ''[[Zodiac]] Braves'', twelve knights who used the power of Zodiac Stones - magical stones engraved with symbols of the twelve Zodiac constellations - to fight against a demon summoned by an ambitious king to control Ivalice. This myth was then twisted by the Glabados Church, as explained in the game's backstory, by including St. Ajora as the leader of the Zodiac Braves. This plot was deemed controversial due to the portraying of St. Ajora as the so-called "son of god".{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

;Lucavi
The name of the demons that existed due to the Zodiac Stones, the ''Lucavi'' seek to regain control of Ivalice by resurrecting their leader, the Bloody Angel Altima/Ultima. As explained in the game's backstory, the Lucavi manipulated the Glabados Church into controlling the war between the two noble factions in order to ensure enough bloodshed for Ultima's resurrection. The Lucavi numbers thirteen, which included the thirteenth sun constellation [[Ophiuchus]]. The Lucavi seen in the game share details with ''Final Fantasy XII'''s Espers, though the connection, if one exists, has yet to be expanded upon.

A proposal: to place the Tactics Advance and Vagrant Story element here.

=== ''Vagrant Story'' ===
[[Image:LeaMonde.jpg|thumb|right|Leá Monde]]
There is no direct mention of Ivalice in ''[[Vagrant Story]]''. However, several references are made; the Kingdom of Valendia, the setting for ''Vagrant Story'', shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in ''Final Fantasy XII''. The Kiltia religion, featured in ''Final Fantasy XII'', was the religion of the [[ghost town]] Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Alazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the Lion War (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in ''Final Fantasy Tactics''), is used at the beginning of the game,<ref>[http://barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/VSScript/vsscript01.html ''Vagrant Story'' script - Duke Bardorba’s Manor]</ref> and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story.<ref> [http://barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/vsodd.html ''FFT References'' section]</ref> In contrast to the other Ivalice games, magic is rare in the kingdom of Valendia, being suppressed by religious doctrine.<ref> [http://barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/VSScript/vsscript06.html ''Vagrant Story'' script - Town Center West]</ref>
