The '''Calgary Flames''' are a [[professional]] [[hockey]] team based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] and play out of the [[Pengrowth Saddledome]]. They play in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in the [[Northwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]].

The Flames arrived in the city of Calgary in 1980 after spending their first eight seasons in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as the [[Atlanta Flames]]. The Flames are the only NHL club to relocate from the [[United States]] to Canada.  The Flames spent their first three seasons playing in the [[Stampede Corral]], during which they lost only 32 games,<ref>{{cite book |title=2006-07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames |pages=pg. 4}}</ref> before moving into the [[Pengrowth Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]] in 1983.

Calgary's top rival are their Alberta cousins, the [[Edmonton Oilers]].  The two teams have often feuded in what is known as the [[Battle of Alberta]], an always feisty, and often memorable matchup eagerly anticipated by fans of both teams.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |author= |title=The uncivil war...Edmonton...April 23, 1988...Oilers 4 Flames 2 |url=http://www.slam.ca/Slam030917/col_francis-sun.html |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2003-09-17 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |author= |title=The uncivil war...Calgary...January 20, 2003...Flames 3 Oilers 2 |url=http://fun.canoe.ca/Slam030921/col_francis-sun.html |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2003-09-21 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref>

==Franchise history==
===Atlanta years (1972-80)===
{{details|Atlanta Flames}}

The Flames were the result of the NHL's first preemptive strike against the upstart [[World Hockey Association]]. In December [[1971-72 NHL season|1971]], the NHL hastily granted a team to [[Long Island]] &mdash; the [[New York Islanders]] &mdash; in order to keep the WHA's [[New York Raiders]] out of the brand new [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]]. Needing another team to balance the schedule, the NHL awarded a team to an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]-based group that owned the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Atlanta Hawks]], headed by prominent local real estate developer [[Tom Cousins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nyi/nylsanders.html|title=History of the New York Islanders|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Cousins named the team the "Flames" after the [[fire]] resulting from the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in the [[American Civil War]] by [[General William Tecumseh Sherman]], in which Atlanta was nearly destroyed.<ref name="atlflames">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/atlflames/aflames.html|title=History of the Atlanta Flames|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

The Flames were very successful early on, at least by the standards of expansion teams.  Under head coaches [[Bernie Geoffrion|Bernie “Boom Boom” Geoffrion]], [[Fred Creighton]] and [[Al MacNeil]], the Flames made the playoffs in six of eight seasons in Atlanta. In marked contrast, their expansion cousins, the Islanders, compiled two of the worst seasons in NHL history during their first two years in the league.  This relative success would not translate in the playoffs, however, as the Flames won only two post season games during their time in Atlanta.

Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing. Part of the reason was that the Flames' home arena, [[The Omni]], was one of the last arenas to be built without revenue-producing luxury boxes.  Also, Cousins' initial calcuations did not account for the WHA entering the picture.<ref name="fletcher">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/halloffame/fletcher110304.html |title=Building a franchise is Flether's forte |accessdate=2006-11-28 |last=McGourty |first=John |date=2004-11-03 |publisher=nhl.com}}</ref>  The Flames were also victims of their own early success, which resulted in several low draft picks. At the same time, the Islanders used high draft picks resulting from their first two wretched seasons to put together the core of a team that would win four [[Stanley Cups]] in a row in the early [[1980s]].

In 1980, Cousins was in considerable financial difficulty, and was forced to sell the Flames to stave off bankruptcy. With few serious offers from local groups, he sold the Flames a group of Calgary businessmen fronted by Canadian entrepreneur, and former owner of the Oilers, [[Nelson Skalbania]].<ref name="atlflames">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/atlflames/aflames.html|title=History of the Atlanta Flames|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  The price of US$16 million was the highest price paid for an NHL franchise at the time. Skalbania promptly moved the team to Calgary, but kept the Flames name since he figured it would be appropriate for an oil town like Calgary. The flaming "A" logo was replaced by a flaming "C" (the "A" was later brought back as the "A" on the alternate captains' jerseys). Skalbania sold his interest in 1982, and the Flames have been locally owned since then.

===Early Years in Calgary (1980-84)===
[[Image:Flames 1980-1995.gif|150px|left|thumb|The original Flames logo, used from 1980-94. A black border was added in 1995.]]
In their first year in [[Alberta]],led by [[Kent Nilsson]]'s 49-goal, 82-assist season, the Flames won their first two playoff series in their current location (a sweep over the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] in the first round and a seven-game victory over the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the second round) before bowing out to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] in the semi-finals.  This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in [[1981-82 NHL season|1981-82]], GM [[Cliff Fletcher]] jettisoned several former Atlanta players unused to a higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster. Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early [[1990s]]. His efforts to match the gifted Oilers, though not wholly successful, led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by the NHL. The Flames were one of the first teams to sign large numbers of U.S. college players, including [[Joel Otto]], [[Gary Suter]], and [[Colin Patterson]]. Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent, acquiring [[Hakan Loob]] and other key players. He was among the first to [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]] players from the [[Soviet Union]], including [[HC CSKA Moscow]] star [[Sergei Makarov]], but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989. Still, the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the great [[Wayne Gretzky]] himself and his Oilers, who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their [[1983-84 NHL season|1984]] [[Stanley Cup]] Championship.

===Glory years (1984-92)===
Fletcher's roster moves in 1982 allowed the Flames to become one of the NHL's best teams during the mid-[[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. They failed to earn 90 points in the regular season only once from 1984 to 1991, but were usually unable to transfer that success into a deep playoff run. The NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in the conference finals. Many observers thought that during the mid-1980s, the Oilers and Flames were far and away the two best teams in the Campbell Conference, and possibly the two best teams in the league.  For example, the Flames had their first 100-point season in [[1987-88 NHL season|1987-88]], earning the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for having the league's best record, and ended the Oilers' six-year reign atop the Smythe Division in the process.  However, they were swept by the Oilers in the second round of the playoffs.  The two teams' bitter rivalry mirrored the longstanding rivalry between their two cities. 

By [[1985-86 NHL season|1986]] the Flames had landed forwards [[Doug Risebrough]], [[Lanny McDonald]], [[Dan Quinn]], defenceman [[Al MacInnis]], and goalie [[Mike Vernon]]. They beat the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in the first round, beat the Oilers in the second round on [[James Stephen Smith|Steve Smith]]'s fluke goal into his own net in the seventh game, and also won in seven games over the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], shaking off the famous "Monday Night Miracle" at [[St. Louis Arena|The Arena]] (where [[Doug Wickenheiser]] scored in overtime to cap off a comeback from 5-1 down with 10 minutes to play) to win the decider at home. They were, however, no match for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the finals, losing in five games.  Montreal [[rookie]] goaltender [[Patrick Roy]], was nearly unstoppable in the last two games, allowing only four goals. It is no coincidence that the Flames made it to the Finals despite finishing with less than 90 points for the only time between 1984 and 1992, since this was the only time during this period that they defeated the Oilers in the playoffs.

On [[March 7]], [[1988]], the Flames traded away young future superstar [[Brett Hull]] along with [[Steve Bozek]] to the Blues for [[Rob Ramage]] and [[Rick Wamsley]].  Nonetheless, the Flames dominated the [[1988-89 NHL season|1988-89 season]], taking full advantage of the Oilers' trade of  [[Wayne Gretzky]] to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] to win their second straight division title in a runaway.  While they were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Canucks (and won due to a controversial goal), they got an unexpected gift when the Kings defeated the Oilers in seven games.  However, the Flames made short work of the Kings (a four-game sweep) and Blackhawks (five games) en route to a rematch of the 1986 finals with the Canadiens.  This time, the Flames won in six games, the last being a 4-2 win in Montreal.  This victory was especially significant in that it marked the second time that an opposing team won the Stanley Cup on [[Montreal Forum]] [[ice]] (the first being the [[New York Rangers]] in [[1927-28 NHL season|1928]], against the [[Montreal Maroons]]), and the first time against the storied Habs.  Longtime captain Lanny McDonald retired at the end of the season.

In 1989, thanks in part to Cliff Fletcher's diplomatic efforts, the Soviets finally gave permission for a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams. The first of these players was Sergei Priakin, a forward who joined the Flames in time for their 1989 playoff run. Although Priakin never became an NHL regular, his arrival blazed a trail for the large numbers of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in [[1989-90 NHL season|1989-90]]. Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and, though already in his thirties, won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]]: Rookie of the Year. It was Fletcher's last great contribution to NHL hockey and to the Flames. In 1991, he left the team to become general manager of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].

===Decline (1992-2003)===
Fletcher was succeeded by Doug Risebrough, who soon traded [[Doug Gilmour]] and four other Flames to his former boss for five inferior Toronto players.  The trade, arguably one of the most one-sided in NHL history, quickly backfired.  Despite the blossoming of [[Theoren Fleury]] (also a rookie in the Stanley Cup championship year) into an NHL star, the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in [[1991-92 NHL season|1992]]--only a year after finishing with their third 100-point season in franchise history--for only the third time in franchise history and the first time since [[1974-75 NHL season|1975]], while they were still in Atlanta.

[[Image:CGY_51.gif|left|thumb|150px|Calgary's  alternate logo 1999-2007; Horse Head]]
They rebounded to make the playoffs for the next three seasons in a row, including two consecutive division titles. However, they failed to get out of the first round in either year. More importantly, the Flames found it increasingly difficult to hold onto their best players as salaries escalated in the 90s. Most of the NHL's Canadian teams (aside from Montreal, Toronto and to a lesser extent, Vancouver) found it difficult to compete in the new environment. As a result, the collapse was sudden, swift and total. In [[1996-97 NHL season|1997]], a year after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years. 

As an example of the difficulties the once-proud franchise faced during this time, they had to trade Fleury midway through [[1998-99 NHL season|1998-99]] rather than lose him to free agency--only a few days after he became the franchise's all-time leading scorer.  The team also seriously considered moving to an American city due to declining ticket sales; during their glory years, Flames tickets were among the toughest in the NHL.  One of the few bright spots in this stretch was [[Jarome Iginla]]. For example, Iginla won the [[Rocket Richard Trophy|Rocket Richard]] and [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] Trophies in 2001-02 with 52 goals and 44 assists &mdash; 96 points, his greatest point total to date. By a surprising coincidence, he took 35 goals and 32 assists the next year. He would also score those exact totals in 2005-06.  He tied for the Rocket Richard Trophy with 41 goals in 2003-04 with [[Ilya Kovalchuk]] and [[Rick Nash]]. Another was defenceman [[Robyn Regehr]], who became the youngest nominee ever for the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]], which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey, in [[1999-2000 NHL season|his rookie year]], despite suffering two broken legs in a car accident the previous summer and a midseason collision with Iginla.

The Blues sent longtime Oilers net minder [[Grant Fuhr]] to Calgary for [[1999-2000 NHL season|1999-2000]], but "The Fury" never found his groove and announced his retirement at season's end.

===2004 playoff run===
After seven consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, the Flames returned to the playoffs in [[2003-04 NHL season|2004]], stunning the hockey world by defeating the three Western Conference division champions to become the first Canadian team in a decade to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/05/19/sharks_flames040519.html |title=Flames reach Stanley Cup finals |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-05-20 |publisher=cbc.ca}}</ref> The 
Flames' first victim was the Northwest Division winners, the 1994 finalist [[Vancouver Canucks]], in seven games. It was the Flames' first playoff series win since they won the 1989 final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2004041922 |title=Recap: Calgary 3, Vancouver 2, OT |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-04-20 |publisher=Yahoo! Sports}}</ref>

Then, they shocked the [[Detroit Red Wings]], who had garnered the league's best record that season, in six games. After eliminating the Pacific Division champs, the [[San Jose Sharks]], in six games in the Western Conference finals, the Flames earned a trip to the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals to face the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. The Canadian Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] flew the Flames flag beside the Maple Leaf,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_hwang/20040528.html |title=Cheering for the home team |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-05-28 |last=Hwang |first=Rosa |publisher=cbc.ca}}</ref> as did San Jose's city hall (after the Sharks lost the series, the Mayor of San Jose [as the losing side in a personal bet with Calgary's mayor] declared his city hall the world headquarters of Flames fans).

The final series went to seven games, with the Flames suffering a controversial non-goal in game six at home.  Replays showed that [[Martin Gelinas]] came close to scoring what would have been the go-ahead goal late in the third period, however the referees ruled it a non-goal, and later replays were ruled inconclusive.  The Lightning would go on to win in [[overtime (hockey)|double overtime]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Damian |last=Cristodero |title= One last shot |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/06/Lightning/One_last_shot.shtml |publisher=St. Petersberg Times |date=2004-06-06 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> before winning game seven at home to capture the Stanley Cup.  Interestingly, all of Calgary's series-winning goals during the playoffs were scored by Gelinas, including two in overtime.

Despite the loss, 30,000 fans packed into [[Olympic Plaza]] to celebrate the Flames run.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Bergman  |title=The Flames nearly brought the Stanley Cup home, and grateful Calgary gave thanks |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0012618 |format=Reprint |publisher=Maclean's Magazine |date=2004-06-21 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref>  The Flames would not raise their Western Conference championship banner for nearly 15 months, as the [[2004-05 NHL season|2004-05 season]] was wiped out by a [[2004-05 NHL lockout|labour dispute]].

===Post lockout (2006-present)===
[[Image:WeaverLankow.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Calgary Flames' [[Daymond Langkow]] moves in on [[Mike Weaver (hockey)|Mike Weaver]] of the [[Los Angeles Kings]], December 21, 2005]]
The Flames roared through the [[2005-06 NHL season|2005-06 season]], finishing with 103 points - their best total since the 1989 Cup-winning season--and their first division title in 12 years.  However, they lost to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in seven games during the  first round of the playoffs.  Star goaltender, [[Miikka Kiprusoff]] captured both the [[Vezina Trophy]] and the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]], while rookie defenceman [[Dion Phaneuf]] set a franchise record for goals by a rookie blueliner with 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/271296.html |title=NHL announces 2005-06 trophy finalists |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2006-05-04 |publisher=nhl.com}}</ref>

The 2006 Off-Season began with the surprising trade for [[Alex Tanguay]], formerly of the [[Colorado Avalanche]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calgaryflames.com/cgi-bin/news/comments.cgi?type=newsroom&file_num=0000000883 |title=Flames acquire Alex Tanguay |accessdate=2006-11-28 |last=Board |first=Mike |publisher=Calgary Flames}}</ref> and with [[Darryl Sutter]] relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant [[Jim Playfair]] to focus on his duties as General Manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=171090&hubname=nhl |title=Sutter steps down as Flames coach |accessdate=2006-11-28 |author=Canadian Press |publisher=tsn.ca}}</ref>. On [[12 December]], [[2006]], the Flames broke a new franchise record for the most consecutive home wins, with 10 straight home wins. The Flames finished the year with 96 points, netting them an 8th place finish in the tough Western Conference (seven teams finished with 100 or more points).  The Flames fell in six games to the top-seeded [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the first round.

==Noteworthy Events==
===The "Red Mile"===
:''See main article: [[Red Mile]]''

During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup finals of 2004, the city of Calgary essentially became the host of a "non-stop party". The 17th Avenue SW entertainment district, which runs West from the Pengrowth Saddledome, flooded with as many as 100,000 red-clad fans after games. Similar celebrations had occurred during Flames celebrations during the successful [[1980s]] and primarily took place along 11th Ave SW, then known as "Electric Avenue".

The "Red Mile" also gained notoriety quickly in 2004 as women would frequently bare their breasts for the crowd atop shoulders or cars. The Red Mile party became world-famous and received worldwide coverage in newspapers. The Red Mile was notable in that incidents were minimal, the crowds were positive, and only one arrest was made after a police officer was injured by a celebrant.

In April 2006, the Calgary Police Service announced that the Red Mile gatherings of 2004 would not be encouraged in 2006, and that measures would be taken to discourage it, including traffic diversions, a zero-tolerance policy on noise and rowdy behaviour, and the presence of plainclothes officers among the crowd to ticket offenders. After meeting with the Chief of Police, Mayor Dave Bronconnier convinced the Calgary Police Service to relax their ban on the "Red Mile" and encouraged people to make their way to 17th Ave. The police retained their zero tolerance policy on public nudity and drunkenness. Many, including Mayor Bronconnier, have responded to the police crackdown as "excessive" and "unnecessary", though the crowds only made appearances in large numbers after Flames wins in the opening series. Concerns were expressed after a Flames win on Saturday, April 29, prompted a rowdy gathering of fans and other celebrants, and fireworks were set off illegally.

===The "C" (Sea) of Red===
During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup finals of 2004, most of the Flames fans attending the hockey games at the Saddledome wore a red jersey with the Flames' famous flaming C on it. Many of those who did not have a red jersey wore a red shirt instead. Thus, the "C" of Red became the nickname for the fans at the Saddledome during the Flames' playoff run, and the trend of an attendance dressed almost entirely in red continued throughout the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. The tradition of the Sea/"C" of red dates back to the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs against the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. Oiler fans were donning hats promoting Hat Trick Fever in their quest for 3 straight Stanley Cups &mdash; "[[three-peat]]" &mdash;, and Flames fans countered by wearing red. In the 1987 playoffs against the [[Winnipeg Jets]], the Jets responded to the "C" of Red by encouraging fans to wear white, which created the [[Winnipeg White Out]].

==="Red Hot" Video===
The Calgary Flames' [[1987]] "Red Hot" video is a music video, created to benefit charities, featuring the players from that year's team. It features players like [[Lanny McDonald]], [[Brett Hull]], [[Gary Roberts (ice hockey)|Gary Roberts]], [[Mike Vernon]], [[Al MacInnis]], and [[Joel Otto]], among others, lipsynching and pretending to play instruments. It was released on VHS and the song was released on vinyl back in 1987. It enjoyed popularity then but was forgotten until the video surfaced on the internet in 2005.

===Honored Members===
''Hall of Famers'':Several members of the Flames organization have been honoured by the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] during the team's 27 year history in Calgary.  [[Lanny McDonald]] was the first Flame player inducted, gaining election in 1992.  McDonald recorded 215 goals in 492 games for the Flames, including a team record 66 goals in [[1982-83 NHL season|1982-83]].  He was joined in 2000 by a fellow member of the 1989 [[Stanley Cup]] championship team, [[Joe Mullen]].  Mullen spent five seasons with the Flames, recording 388 points and capturing two [[Lady Byng Trophy|Lady Byng Trophies]].  [[Grant Fuhr]] became the third former Flames player to enter the Hall, having been elected in 2003.  Fuhr played only one season in Calgary, however he recorded his 400th career win in a Flames uniform with a victory over the [[Florida Panthers]] on [[October 22]], [[1999]].<ref name="hhof">Hockey Hall of Fame, ''2006-07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pts. 20-21</ref>

Former head coach "Badger" [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey)|Bob Johnson]] joined McDonald in the class of 1992, gaining election as a builder. Johnson coached five seasons with the Flames from 1982-87, and his 193 wins remains a team record.

During that time, the Flames qualified for the playoffs sixteen consecutive times between 1976 and 1991. Fletcher was inducted in 2004.  [[Harley Hotchkiss]] became the third builder to gain election in 2006.  Hotchkiss is an original member of the ownership group that purchased and brought the Flames to Calgary in 1980. He has served many years as the chairman of the NHL Board of Directors, during which he played a significant role in the resolution of the [[2004-05 NHL lockout|2004-05 lockout]].<ref name="hhof" />

Flames radio broadcaster [[Peter Maher (hockey announcer)|Peter Maher]] was named the recipient of the [[Foster Hewitt Memorial Award]] in 2006 for his years of service as the radio play by play announcer for the Calgary Flames.
