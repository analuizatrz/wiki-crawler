'''Assata Shakur'''<ref name="namechange">''New York Times''. 1978, March 31. Section 2; Page 17, Column 3.</ref> (born [[July 16]], [[1947]]) under the name '''Joanne Deborah Byron Chesimard''',{{fn|Â°}} is an [[African-American]] [[activist]] who was a member of the [[Black Panther Party]] and [[Black Liberation Army]]. In [[1977]] she was [[conviction|convicted]] of several [[felony|felonies]] in relation to the [[1973]] slayings of [[New Jersey State Police|New Jersey State Trooper]] Werner Foerster and fellow activist Zayd Malik Shakur.  

She escaped from prison in [[1979]] and has been living in [[Cuba]] with [[right to asylum|political asylum]] since [[1984]].  Since [[May 2]], [[2005]], she has been classified as a "domestic terrorist" by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], which has offered a $1 million reward for assistance in her capture.

==Early life==
Shakur was born in [[New York City]], [[New York]] on [[July 16]], [[1947]], (or, according to the FBI, [[August 19]], [[1952]]) but spent most of her childhood in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]<ref name="scheffler203">Scheffler, p. 203.</ref> until her family relocated to [[Queens]] when she was a teenager. She attended [[Borough of Manhattan Community College]] and [[City College of New York]] in the mid 1960s, where she was involved in many political activities. After graduation, Shakur became involved in the [[Black Panther Party]] and the [[Black Liberation Army]].<ref name="james">James, Matthew Thomas. Joy James (Ed.). 2005.

Msgr. John Powis alleged that Shakur was involved in an armed robbery at his Our Lady of the Presentation church in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]] on [[September 14]], [[1972]] based on [[FBI]] photographs; Shakur was not charged with this robbery and the only person arrested for it was acquitted.<ref name="Daily News Article"> Daly, Michael. 2006, December 13. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/12-13-2006/news/story/479642p-403539c.html The Msgr. & the Militant]." ''New York Daily News''.</ref>

In [[1972]], Shakur was made the subject of a nationwide manhunt after the F.B.I. alleged that she was the "revolutionary mother hen" of a Black Liberation Army cell which had conducted a "series of cold-blooded murders of [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officers]]."<ref name="churchill308"/> After her capture, however, Shakur was charged with none of the killings which had made her the subject of the manhunt.<ref name="churchill308"/>

==New Jersey Turnpike shootout==
On [[May 2]], [[1973]], Shakur, at that time a member of the [[Black Liberation Army]] and no longer a member of the Black Panther Party, was stopped on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] by State Troopers James Harper and Werner Foerster, along with two Black Panthers: Zayd Malik Shakur (no relation) and [[Sundiata Acoli]], for driving with a broken taillight. Accounts of the confrontation differ (see the [[Assata Shakur#Witnesses|witnesses section]] below), but Zayd Shakur and Trooper Foerester were killed in the ensuing shootout, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were injured.<ref name="williamsfacts"/>

Acoli then drove the car&mdash;which contained Assata, who was wounded, and Zayd, who was dead&mdash;several miles down the road, where Assata Shakur was apprehended. Acoli then exited the car and fled into the woods and was captured after a [[manhunt]] the following day.<ref>Marpessa Kupendua. 1998, January 28. "[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/090.html Sundiatta Acoli]." ''Revolutionary Worker''. No. 94.</ref>

==Trials==
Between 1973 and 1977, in [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]], Shakur was indicted 10 times in 7 different criminal trials, including two [[bank robbery|bank robberies]], the [[kidnapping]] of a [[Brooklyn]] [[heroin]] dealer, [[attempted murder]] of two [[Queens]] police officers steming from a [[January 23]], [[1973]] failed ambush, and the murder of a New Jersey state trooper.<ref name="taylor">Taylor, Mark Lewis. 1999, January 17. "Flight From Justice." ''New York Times''. Section 14NJ; Page 15; Column 1.</ref><ref name="nelson">Nelson, Jim. 1988, February 29. The Soul Survivor; Assata Shakur on the Making of a Radical." ''The Washington Post''. p. B6.</ref><ref name="churchill308"/> Shakur's defense attorneys included [[Lennex Hinds]], [[William Kunstler]], [[Evelyn Williams]], [[Bob Bloom]], [[Florynce Kennedy]], [[Ray Brown (lawyer)|Ray Brown]], and Stanley Cohen, who died of unknown causes early on in Shakur's last trial.<ref name="nelson"/><ref>''Assata'', p. 247.</ref> Of these trials, three resulted in [[acquittal]]s, one in a [[hung jury]], and two in dismissals.<ref name="nelson"/> In one of her bank robbery trials, the jury determined that a widely-circulated F.B.I. photo allegedly showing her participating in the robbery was not her.<ref name="taylor"/>

Judge Leon Gerofsky ordered a [[change of venue]] in 1973 to [[Morris County, New Jersey]], saying "it is almost impossible to obtain a jury here comprised of people willing to accept the responsibility of impartiality so that defendants will be protected from transitory passion and prejudice."<ref name="williamsfacts"/> Shakur was originally slated to be tried together with Acoli, but the trials were separated due to her pregnancy,<ref name="williamsfacts"/> and hers resulted in a [[mistrial]] in 1974.<ref name="hinds">Atty. Lennex Hinds. 1998, October 26. "[http://www.assatashakur.org/trial.htm The injustice of the trial]." ''Covert Action Quarterly''.</ref> By the time her 1977 trial started, Acoli had already been convicted of firing the bullets which killed Trooper Foerester.<ref name="churchill308"/>

On [[March 25]], [[1977]]&mdash;back in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]]&mdash;Shakur was convicted as an [[accomplice]] the [[Felony murder|murders]] of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Zayd Shakur, possession of weapons, as well as [[assault]] and [[attempted murder]] of Trooper Harper. Under New Jersey law at the time, if a person's "mere presence" at a crime scene could be construed as "[[accomplice|aiding and abetting]]" that crime, that person could be charged with the substantive crime.<ref name="williamsfacts"/> She was sentenced to life plus 33 years in prison.<ref name="james"/><ref name="nelson"/><ref name="hinds"/> 

All of the jury members were white and five had personal ties to State Troopers.<ref name="williamsfacts"/><ref name="joy">James, Joy. p. 144.</ref> The judge did not allow evidence of alleged [[COINTELPRO]] involvement to be admitted during her trial and refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office which resulted in the disappearance of trial documents.<ref name="joy"/>

===Witnesses===

Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper  Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike driver who saw part of the incident were the only surviving witnesses.<ref name="williamsfacts">Evelyn A. Williams. 2005, June 25. "[http://assatashakur.org/appeal_case_facts_2005.htm Statement of Facts in the New Jersey trial of Assata Shakur]."</ref> 

Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements.<ref name="williamsfacts"/> The driver traveling North on the turnpike testified that he had seen a State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.<ref name="williamsfacts"/>

Shakur testified that Trooper Harper shot her after she raised her arms to comply with his demand, the second shot hitting her in the back as she was turning to avoid it, and that she climbed into the backseat of the Pontiac which Acoli drove five miles down the road and parked, and remained there until State Troopers dragged her onto the road.<ref name="williamsfacts"/>

Trooper Harper's three official reports state that after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli to the back of the vehicle  for Trooper Foerester&mdash;who had arrived on the scene&mdash;to examine his [[driver's license]], and that after Acoli complied and as he was looking inside the vehicle to examine the [[vehicle registration|registration]], Trooper Foerester yelled and held up an ammunition clip, as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red [[purse|pocketbook]], pulled out a [[9 mm caliber|nine-millimeter weapon]] and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Assata Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.<ref name="williamsfacts"/><ref name="taylor"/> In his [[Grand Jury]] testimony, Trooper Harper swore under oath that these reports were correct.<ref name="williamsfacts"/> 

Under [[cross-examination]] at both Acoli and Shakur's trials, Trooper Harper admitted to having lied in these reports and in his [[Grand Jury]] testimony about Trooper Foerester yelling and showing him an ammunition clip, about seeing Shakur holding a pocketbook or a gun inside the vehicle, and about Shakur shooting at him from the car.<ref name="williamsfacts"/><ref name="taylor"/>

===Medical evidence===
A key element of Shakur's defense was [[forensic biology|medical testimony]] meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A [[neurologist]] testified that the [[median nerve]] in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger;<ref name="hinds"/> a [[surgeon]] testified that it was "absolutely anatomically necessary" for Shakur's arms to have been in the air given her wounds and that Trooper Harper's claim that she was crouching was "totally anatomically impossible"; a [[pathologist]] testified that there was "no conceivable way" the first bullet could have hit Shakur's [[clavicle]] if her arm was down.<ref>Shakur, Assata. "[http://www.assatashakur.org/escape3.htm An Open Letter from Assata]." p. 3.</ref>

===Forensic evidence===
[[Neutron activation analysis]] administered after the shootout showed no [[gun powder]] residue on Shakur's fingers, which&mdash;her lawyers argued&mdash;proved she could not have shot a weapon; her [[fingerprint]]s were not found on any weapon at the scene, according to forensic analysis performed at the [[Trenton, New Jersey]] crime lab and the F.B.I. crime labs in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name="hinds"/><ref name="williamsfacts"/>

==Imprisonment==
After the Turnpike shootings, Shakur was imprisoned in New Jersey State Reception and Correction center<ref>Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wal. p. 410.</ref> in Yardville, [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]] and later moved to [[Rikers Island|Rikers Island Correctional Institution for Women]] in [[New York City]]<ref name="scheffler203"/> where she was kept in [[solitary confinement]].<ref name="muhammad">Muhammad, Nisa Islam. 2005, May 16. "[http://www.assatashakur.org/stakes.htm Assata: The stakes are raised]." ''Final Call News''.</ref>  Shakur's only daughter, Kakuya Shakur, was conceived during her trial and given birth to in prison.<ref name="nelson"/><ref name="scheffler203"/> On [[April 8]], [[1978]], Shakur was transferred to [[Alderson Federal Prison Camp]] in [[Alderson, West Virginia]] where she met [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[Lolita LebrÃ³n]]<ref name="scheffler203"/> and Mary Alice, a Catholic nun, who introduced Shakur to the concept of [[liberation theology]].<ref name="scheffler206">Scheffler, p. 206.</ref> At Alderson, Shakur was housed in the Maximum Security Unit, which also contained several members of the Aryan Sisterhood as well as [[Sandra Good]] and [[Lynette Fromme]], followers of [[Charles Manson]].<ref>Scheffler, p. 204.</ref> 

In 1978, after the Maximum Security Unit at Alderson was closed,<ref name="scheffler206"/> Shakur was transferred to the [[Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women|Clinton Correctional Facility for Women]] in [[New Jersey]].<ref name="scheffler203"/>

==Escape and political asylum in Cuba==
On [[November 2]], [[1979]] she escaped the [[Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women|Clinton Correctional Facility for Women]] in New Jersey, after members of the [[Black Liberation Army]] conducted an armed action. No one, including the guards, was injured during the prison break.<ref name="churchill308"/> Charged with assisting in her escape was her brother, [[Mutulu Shakur]], and [[Silvia Baraldini]].  In part for his role in the event, Mutulu was named on [[July 23]], [[1982]] as the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|380th addition to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list, where he remained for the next four years until his capture in 1986.

After her escape, Assata lived as a fugitive for the next several years. The F.B.I. circulated "wanted" posters throughout the New York-New Jersey area; her supporters hung "Assata Shakur is welcome here" posters in response.<ref name="cleaver2">Cleaver, Kathleen. 2005, August. "The Fugitive." ''Essesnce''.</ref> 
[[Image:assatabio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Assata: An Autobiography'']]
She fled to [[Cuba]] in 1984 where she was granted [[political asylum]], saying she had never received a fair trial.<ref name="cleaver2"/> In 1985 she was reunited with her daughter, Kakuya, who had previously been raised by Shakur's mother in New York.<ref name="scheffler203"/> She published ''Assata: An Autobiography'', which was written in Cuba, in 1987. Her autobiography does not give a detailed account of the events on the New Jersey Turnpike, except saying that the jury "Convicted a woman with her hands up!"<ref name="nelson"/>

Shakur, to this day, maintains her innocence, and her writings to this effect have been widely circulated on the [[internet]].<ref>''Chronic Magazine''. "[http://www.chronicmagazine.com/public.php?level=1&page_id=607 $1 million bounty on Tupac's godmother]."</ref> 

===Extradition attempts===
In 1997, Carl Williams, the superintendent of the New Jersey State Police wrote a letter to the [[Pope John Paul II]] asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's [[extradition]] during his talks with President [[Fidel Castro]].<ref>Chicago Sun Times. 1997, December 28. "N.J. cops enlist pope; Seek help in getting fugitive out of Cuba." p. 34.</ref> During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist [[Ralph Penza]].<ref name="assataletter2">Shakur, Assata. "[http://www.assatashakur.org/escape2.htm An Open Letter from Assata]." p. 2.</ref> On [[March 10]], 1998&mdash;the 85th anniversary of the death of [[Harriet Tubman]]&mdash;[[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Christine Todd Whitman]] asked [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] to do whatever it takes to return Shakur from Cuba.<ref>Brath, Elombe. 1998, March 13. "[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/100.html N.J. Bloodhounds on Assata's Trail]." ''NY Daily Challenge''.</ref> Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the [[United States Department of State|United States State Department]] had offered to lift the [[United States embargo against Cuba|Cuban embargo]] in exchange for the return of ninety U.S. political exiles, including Shakur.<ref>James, Joy. p. 115.</ref>

In [[1998]], the United States Congress passed a resolution asking Cuba for the [[extradition|"return"]] of Joanne Chesimard;  House Concurrent Resolution 254 passed 371-0 in the House and by [[unanimous consent]] in the Senate.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HC00254:@@@R House Concurrent Resolution 254].</ref>  Many members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] later explained that they were against her extradition, but mistakenly voted for the bill which was placed on the accelerated suspension calendar, generally reserved for non-controversial legislation.<ref>Waters, Maxine. 1998, September 29. "[http://www.assatashakur.org/waters.htm Congresswoman Waters issues statement on U.S. Freedom Fighter Assata Shakur]."</ref>  Representative [[Maxine Waters]] of California, who voted for the resolution, later explained her opposition, calling [[COINTELPRO]] "illegal, clandestine political persecution."<ref name="taylor"/>

On [[May 2]], [[2005]], the thirty-second anniversary of the Turnpike shootings, the F.B.I. classified her as a "domestic terrorist", increasing the reward for assistance in her capture to $1 million,<ref name="cleaver">Cleaver, Kathleen. 2005. "[http://www.assatashakur.org/cleaver_k.htm The Fugitive: Why has the FBI placed a million-dollar bounty on Assata Shakur?]."</ref><ref name="cleaver2"/> the largest reward placed on an individual in the [[history of New Jersey]].<ref name="williams"/> [[New Jersey State Police|New Jersey State Police superintendent]] Rick Fuentes said "she is now 120 pounds of money."<ref name="williams"/>

==Legacy==
A [[documentary film]] about Shakur, "Eyes of the Rainbow," written and directed by Gloria Rolando, appeared in [[1997]].<ref name="scheffler203"/>

The [[National Conference of Black Lawyers]], and [[Mos Def]] are among the professional organizations and entertainers to support Assata Shakur; The "Hands off Assata" campaign is organized by Dream Hampton.<ref name="williams"/> Hip-hop artist [[Common (rapper)|Common]] recorded a tribute to Shakur, "A Song for Assata," on his album ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (album)|Like Water for Chocolate]]''.<ref name="williams"/> Rapper [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]] recorded a similar "Assata's Song."<ref name="williams"/> 

On [[December 12]], [[2006]], the Chancellor of the [[City University of New York]], [[Matthew Goldstein]], directed City College's president, Gregory H. Williams, to remove the "unauthorized and inappropriate" designation of the "Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Community and Student Center," which was named by students in 1989, when a student group won the right to use the lounge after a campus shutdown over proposed tuition increases.<ref>Arenson, Karen W. 2006, December 13. "[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/nyregion/13cuny.html CUNY Chief Orders Names Stripped From Student Center]." ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1995, Manhattan Community College renamed a scholarship which had previously been named for Shakur, following controversy.<ref>Honan, William H. 1995, April 12.
