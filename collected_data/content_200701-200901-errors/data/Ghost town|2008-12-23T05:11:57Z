[[Image:Bannack.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Bannack, Montana]], USA, a well-preserved ghost town that is now a State Park.]]
A '''ghost town''' is a [[town]] or [[city]] that has been completely abandoned by human inhabitants, usually because the economic activity that supported it has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as [[flood]], government action, uncontrolled lawlessness or [[war]]. The term is sometimes used in a depreciative sense to include cities, towns, and neighborhoods which, while still populated, are significantly less so than years past.

A ghost town may be a site where little or nothing remains above the soil surface (e.g., [[Babylon]] оr [[Smeerenburg]]). Often a ghost town will still have significant art and architecture, e.g. [[Vijayanagara]] in [[India]] or [[Changan]] in China.

Some ghost towns are [[tourism|tourist]] attractions, among them [[Oatman, Arizona]], [[Bannack, Montana]], [[Kolmanskop]] and [[Elizabeth Bay (Namibian ghost town)|Elizabeth Bay]], outside [[Lüderitz]], [[Namibia]]. This is especially true of those that preserve interesting architecture. Visiting, writing about, and photographing ghost towns is a minor industry. 

Some ghost towns may be overgrown, difficult to access, and dangerous or illegal to visit.

==Factors==
[[Image:Cassilis historical area02.jpg|thumb|right|300px|As with many gold rush towns, the once thriving community of [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] is now abandoned]]
 
Factors leading to abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources (as was the case of [[Smeerenburg]] and [[Grytviken]]), or natural resources such as water no longer being available; [[railway]]s and [[motorway]]s bypassing or no longer accessing the town (as was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic [[Opeongo Line]]); economic activity shifting elsewhere; human intervention such as highway re-routing (as was the case with many towns located along [[U.S. Route 66]], after motorists bypassed the towns on the faster moving [[I-44]] and [[I-40]]); river re-routing (the [[Aral Sea]] being one example of this), and nuclear disasters such as [[Chernobyl]]. Significant fatality rates from [[epidemic]]s have also produced ghost towns; for example, some places in eastern [[Arkansas]] were abandoned after near-total mortality (over 7,000 Arkansans died  during the [[Spanish Flu]] epidemic of 1918 and 1919).<ref>[http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2004/11/21/living/03flu1918.prt Print Version<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Middle East has many ghost towns, created when the shifting of politics or fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically non-viable, e.g., [[Ctesiphon]].

Natural disasters can also create ghost towns. After being flooded more than 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of [[Pattonsburg, Missouri]] had enough after two floods in 1993. With government help, the whole town was rebuilt three miles (5 km) away. Residents moved to  New Pattonsburg, leaving the old Pattonsburg behind as a ghost town.

Due to improvements in scientific testing and warning procedures, ghost towns may also occasionally come into being due to an ''anticipated'' natural disaster — for example, the Canadian town of [[Lemieux, Ontario]] was abandoned in 1991 after soil testing revealed that the community was built on an unstable clay bed. Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former townsite into the [[South Nation River]].

Land contamination can also create a ghost town. This is what happened to [[Times Beach]], a suburb of [[St. Louis]] whose residents were exposed to a high level of [[dioxins]]. [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] was abandoned by many people due to a dangerous underground coal fire. Since some residents chose to stay despite the dangers, it cannot be classified as a true ghost town.

Ghost towns may also be created when land is [[eminent domain|expropriated]] by a government and residents are required to relocate. An example was when [[NASA]] acquired land to build a  [[rocket]] propulsion testing center. Construction of the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] in [[Mississippi]] required acquisition of a large [[buffer zone]] (approximately 34 square miles) because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing huge rockets. Communities were abandoned and roads became overgrown by forest.

Construction of [[dam]]s has produced ghost towns left underwater. Examples include the settlement of [[Loyston, Tennessee]], inundated by the creation of [[Norris Lake, Tennessee|Norris Lake]]. The town was reorganized and reconstructed on nearby higher ground. Other examples are [[The Lost Villages]] of [[Ontario]], and the hamlets of [[Nether Hambleton]] and [[Middle Hambleton]] in [[Rutland]], England, which were flooded to create [[Rutland Water]], Europe's largest man-made reservoir, [[Mologa]] in [[Russia]] that was flooded by the creation of [[Rybinsk reservoir]]. Many ancient villages had to be abandoned during construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, leading to displacement of many rural people.

==Revived ghost towns==
A few ghost towns manage a second life, often due to heritage tourism propagating an economy able to support residents. [[Walhalla, Victoria|Walhalla]], [[Australia]], for example, was a town deserted after its gold mine ceased operation. Owing to its accessibility and proximity to other attractive locations, Walhalla has had a recent surge in economy and population.

[[Alexandria]], the second largest city of Egypt, was a flourishing city in the Ancient era, but declined during the Middle Ages. With only 150 residents in the early 19th century, it qualified as a ghost town. During the Modern period, it has grown to a city of 3.5 to 5 million inhabitants. In [[Algeria]], many cities became hamlets after the end of [[Late Antiquity]]. They were revived with shifts in population during and after [[French Algeria|French colonization of Algeria]]. [[Oran]], today the nation's second largest city with 1 million people, before colonization was a village of a few thousand people.

==Ghost towns around the world==
===Americas===
====Argentina====
Most 19th and 20th century European immigrants to [[Argentina]] settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities.

The 1990s saw many rural towns become ghost towns when train services ceased and local products previously manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of cheap imported goods. Some ghost towns near cities offer tourist attractions, especially during weekends.

====Brazil====
The small [[village]] of Caraíbas, in the [[municipality]] of Itacarambi, state of [[Minas Gerais]], suffered an [[earthquake]] in the early morning of December 9, 2007. Measuring 4.9 degrees on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]], the earthquake was rare in Brazil. Located over a [[geological fault]], the village (76 families) was evacuated and has been abandoned since then.

====Canada====
{{See also|List of ghost towns in Canada|List of ghost towns in British Columbia|Ghost towns in Alberta|Ghost towns in Saskatchewan}}
Ghost towns are seen in [[Northern Ontario]], [[Central Ontario]], [[British Columbia]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] (see [[Newfoundland outport|outport]]) and in [[Quebec]]. Some of these were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often [[Company town|developed at the behest of the company]]. In British Columbia, they were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns.  

British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.<ref>Bruce Ramsey, ''Ghost Towns of British Columbia", Mitchell Press, Vancouver (1963-1975)</ref><!--other book refs added shortly--> Some ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]], once the largest town north of [[Kamloops]], which is now a year-round Provincial Museum.

====Chile====
Most of the ghost towns in Chile had once been mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] mining camps that prospered from the end of the [[Saltpeter War]] until the invention of [[synthetic saltpeter]] during [[World War I]]. The ghost towns of [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works]] in the middle of the [[Atacama Desert]] were declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s in 2005. The copper mining camp of [[Sewell, Chile|Sewell]], high up in the [[Andes]] of [[Central Chile]], was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006. Despite protection laws, this ghost town suffers "tourist looting." 

[[Port Famine]] ({{lang-es|Puerto Hambre}}) is arguably Chile's oldest ghost town. It was founded in the [[Strait of Magellan]] in 1584 by [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]]. Starvation and the cold climate killed all of the inhabitants. The [[England|English]] [[navigator]], Sir [[Thomas Cavendish]] landed at the site in 1587. He found only ruins of the settlement, and renamed the place ''Port Famine''.

Other lesser known ghost towns are located in the southern part of the [[Chilean Coast Range]]. They were once lumbermills where [[Fitzroya]] were cut down to make [[roof shingles]], a typical element of [[Chilota architecture]].

====Guyana====
[[Jonestown]] in [[Guyana]] became a ghost town because of the mass suicide of the [[Peoples Temple]] community that lived there.

====Mexico====
* [[Ojuela]]
* [[Real de Catorce]],

'''[[Real de Catorce]]''' was once a flourishing [[silver]] mining town in northern Mexico. Its dramatic landscapes and buildings have been used by Hollywood for movies such as ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001) with [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Julia Roberts]]. Recent efforts to adapt the town to tourism have created a mixture of ghost town and heritage tourist site adapted to visitors in search of interesting history in the country.

====United States====
[[Image:Bodie ghost town.jpg|thumb|300px|A street corner in the ghost town of [[Bodie, California]].]]
{{main|List of ghost towns in the United States}}
There are many ghost towns, or semi-ghost towns (some of them [[unincorporated communities]]) in the American [[Great Plains]], whose rural areas have lost a third of their population since 1920.  Thousands of communities in the northern plains states like [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Montana]] and [[Nebraska]] became railroad ghost towns when a rail-line failed to materialize. Hundreds more were abandoned when the US Highway System replaced the railroads as America's favorite mode of travel. Ghost towns are common in [[mining]] or old [[mill town]] areas: [[Washington]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Montana]], [[Minnesota]], and [[California]] in the western [[United States]] and [[West Virginia]] in the eastern USA. They can be observed as far south as [[Texas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Florida]]. When the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns played out, eventually the businesses ceased to exist, and the people moved on to more productive areas. Sometimes a ghost town consists of many old abandoned buildings (like in [[Bodie, California]]), other times there are simply structures or foundations of former buildings (e.g., [[Graysonia, Arkansas]]). Even some of the earliest settlements in the US are or have been ghost towns, such as [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the [[Zwaanendael Colony]] in Delaware and the famous [[Lost Colony]] in [[North Carolina]].

Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history, such as [[St. Elmo, Colorado]]; [[Central City, Colorado]]; [[Aspen, Colorado]]; [[Virginia City, Montana]]; [[Marysville, Montana]]; [[Tombstone, Arizona]]; [[Deadwood, South Dakota]]; [[Park City, Utah]]; [[Crested Butte, Colorado]]; or [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]], are sometimes included in the category, although they are active towns and cities today.

A recent attempt to declare an "Official Ghost Town" in California collapsed when the adherents of the town of [[Calico, California|Calico]], in [[Southern California]], and those of [[Bodie, California|Bodie]], in [[Northern California]], could not come to an agreement as to which of their favorites was more deserving.

The ghost town of [[Medicine Mound, Texas|Medicine Mound]] in [[Hardeman County, Texas|Hardeman County]] in [[West Texas]] is preserved through a [[museum]] operated there by [[Myna Potts]]. Medicine Mound consists of two buildings. The museum is in the former Hicks-Cobb [[General Store]].

A more recent ghost town is [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]], which at its peak had over 2,600 residents in either the borough itself or in immediately adjacent areas and was over 1,000 as recent as 1981 but as of 2007 is down to nine residents as a result of a [[coal seam fire|underground mine fire]] that started in the 1960s when a landfill created from an abandoned [[strip mine]] was set on fire. (At the time, it was legal to create a landfill from an abandoned strip mine as long as it was sealed off from any possible [[coal]] seams that could catch fire; this [[loophole]] has since been closed because of Centralia.) [[Pennsylvania]] later acquired the borough through [[eminent domain]] so it could get the residents safely moved to other areas, though a small handful remain.<ref>See [[Bill O'Neal]], ''Ghost Towns of the American West'' (1995).</ref>

===Antarctica===
[[Image:Deception-Base.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The derelict British base in Whalers Bay, Deception Island, destroyed by volcano eruption]]
[[Image:Grytvikken.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ghost town of Grytviken, South Georgia Island]]
The oldest ghost town in [[Antarctica]] is located in [[Deception Island]], where in 1906 a Norwegian-Chilean whaling company started using Whalers Bay as a base for a factory ship, the Gobernador Bories. Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were 13 factory ships based there.

Antarctica also has many more-recently abandoned scientific and military bases, especially in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].

====South Georgia====
The [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] used to have several thriving whaling settlements during the first half of the 20th century, with a combined population exceeding 2,000 in some years. These included [[Grytviken]] (operating 1904[[1964|-64]]), [[Leith Harbour]] (1909[[1965|-65]]), [[Ocean Harbour]] (1909[[1920|-20]]), [[Husvik]] (1910[[1960|-60]]), [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]] (1912[[1961|-61]]) and [[Prince Olav Harbour]] (1917[[1934|-34]]). The abandoned settlements have become increasingly dilapidated, and remain uninhabited nowadays except for the Museum curator's family at Grytviken. The jetty, the church, and dwelling and industrial buildings at Grytviken have recently been renovated by the Government of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], becoming a popular tourist destination. Some historical buildings in the other settlements are being restored too.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Similar to the United States, Canada and other former frontier countries, most ghost towns in [[Australia]] were usually formed after the end of mining operations or the removal of railway services. They are spread throughout the country and are located in every state and territory. Some ghost towns in Australia include [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Farina, South Australia|Farina]] in the far north of [[South Australia]], [[Newnes, New South Wales|Newnes]] in New South Wales, and [[Goldsworthy, Western Australia|Goldsworthy]], [[Cossack, Western Australia|Cossack]], [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]] in [[Western Australia]]. [[Ravenswood, Queensland|Ravenswood]] in north-eastern [[Queensland]] was a ghost town for many years, due to the declining gold rushes, but new gold discoveries in the area and improved mineral processing technologies, has boosted the economy of the area and revived the town.

[[Old Adaminaby]] in New South Wales is an example of one of the drowned towns which has been subsequently revealed through drought in recent decades.<ref>http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/world/drought-uncovers-australias-drowned-town-20070419-8ag.html</ref>

===Europe===
In Europe, many [[village]]s were abandoned over the ages, for many different reasons. 

Sometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life, and it is never resettled. This happened to the Swedish town [[Sjöstad]], in [[Närke]], in 1260, when the town's 700 merchants had crossed the ice of Lake [[Vättern]] and been cut down by the Danes. The Danes then proceeded to the town, ravaging and burning it. The town was never resettled. A farm named ''Skyrstad'', ruins and a silver treasure which yielded 4000 coins are all that testify to its existence (see [[abandoned village]]). It also happened to the French village [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] in 1944. Natural disasters also play a role. For example, the erupting volcano of [[Vesuvius]] famously terminated [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] in Italy in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 79.

In the United Kingdom, the once thriving farming village of [[Knaptoft]] in [[Leicestershire]] was depopulated due to the enclosure of the surrounding land for sheep pasture. The ruins of the former church still exist as a graveyard, with graves even occupying ground inside the ruins of the church. The villages of [[Imber]] on [[Salisbury Plain]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Tyneham]] near [[Dorset]]'s historic [[Jurassic Coast]], as well as several villages within the [[Stanford Battle Area]] in [[Norfolk]], were evacuated by the [[British Army]], and the abandoned buildings are now used for training exercises. The creation of [[reservoir]]s has led to the drowning of villages. These include [[Mardale|Mardale Green]] in the [[Lake District|English Lake District]] and two villages - [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent Village, Derbyshire|Derwent]] - drowned by the [[Ladybower Reservoir]] in [[Derbyshire]]. Also in [[Wales]] the village of [[Capel Celyn]] was drowned to form [[Llyn Celyn]], to provide water for Liverpool, and [[Llyn Clywedog]] drowned farmsteads and agricultural land to reduce flooding of the [[River Severn]].
[[Image:Smeerenburg-blubberovens.JPG|thumbnail|300px|right|Remains of the 17th century Smeerenburg, Spitsbergen]]
Industrialisation is another factor. For example, the village of [[Etzweiler]] in northwestern [[Germany]] was abandoned in the 1990s to make way for a [[coal]] ([[lignite]]) mine [http://www.xs4all.nl/~kazil/etzweiler.html] [http://diggelfjoer.swalker.nl/index.php?main=aband&sub=abandetz]. While Etzweiler disappeared in 2006, neighbouring [[Pesch]] and Holz have become near-deserted ghost towns by now (January 2008) and all that is left of [[Otzenrath]] are the remains of the village's church, where archeologists excavate remains of sacred buildings from medieval and potentially Roman times. [http://www.forbidden-places.net/urban-exploration-otzenrath-ghost-town]. Furthermore, parts of the motorway A44 have been removed and as the lignitemine continues to move west, parts of the A61 will follow before 2020 (with the A44 being rebuilt behind the mine).

Also in Belgium, several villages had to disappear to facilitate the expansion of the port of [[Antwerp]], such as the former villages of Oosterweel, Oordam, [[Wilmarsdonk]], Lillo and Oorderen. Soon, the village of Doel will follow suit.

[[Pyramiden]] (Danish, Swedish and Norwegian, meaning "the pyramid", Russian: Пирамида) was a [[Russia]]n settlement and coal mining community on the archipelago of [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]]. It was founded by [[Sweden]] in 1910, and sold to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1927. The settlement, with a one time population of 1,000 inhabitants, was abandoned in the late-1990s by its owner, the state-owned Soviet company Trust Artikugol, and is now a ghost town. There are no restrictions on visiting Pyramiden. However, visitors may not enter any buildings without permission, even if the doors are open. Most buildings are now locked. Pyramiden is accessible by boat or snowmobile. Guided tours are available (in Russian, Norwegian, and English).

The city of [[Pripyat, Ukraine|Prypiat]] and dozens of smaller settlements in northern [[Ukraine]] and southern [[Belarus]] were abandoned after the [[Chernobyl accident|Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] and turned into a closed [[zone of alienation|alienation zone]]. The area has been largely untouched since then, and as such it functions as a large [[time capsule]] of the late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era. There is an [http://www.kiddofspeed.com/chapter1.html online photojournal] of this area.

Several communities became ghost towns in [[Ireland]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century, particularly in the west of the country, due to a combination of the [[potato famine]] and economic decline brought on by the famine. These now consist primarily of knee high ruins of cottages. Notable ghost towns are on [[Achill Island]] and in the [[Burren]] area of county Clare. A more recent ghost town was created in the 1950s on [[Great Blasket]] island, where island life became unfeasible and the island was depopulated. The Island is only accessible to tourists in the summer months.

The [[Île aux Marins]] of the [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]] group of islands has been uninhabited since 1965.

In [[Finland]], which is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, most people live in the biggest towns, and some villages near the Russian border and in [[Lapland Province|Lapland]] are nearly abandoned.

While [[Athens]], Greece, experienced severe decline after the end of the Byzantine Empire, it may never have been a ghost town, although it certainly came close, dwindling to some 3,000 or 4,000 people by the 19th century. It has since gone back to being a major city. [[Rome]] experienced similar declines, but it too hasn't been completely abandoned (one of its lowest estimated populations was 17,000 in 1347, down from more than a million in Imperial times {{Fact|date=February 2007}}).

====Wales====
The village of [[Nant Gwrtheyrn]] on the Llŷn in Gwynedd, North Wales was an old quarry village which was abandoned in the 1950s after the quarry closed because there was no road leading to the village.  It has since been restored as a (Welsh) Language learning centre.

====Hungary====
Hundreds of villages were abandoned during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] wars in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 16-17th century. Many of them were never repopulated but generally they are not classified as ghost towns because few visible traces remained of them. Real ghost towns are rare in present-day [[Hungary]], except the abandoned villages of [[Derenk]] (left in 1943) and [[Nagygéc]] (left in 1970). Due to the decrease of rural population beginning in the 1980s dozens of villages are now threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as "died out" was [[Gyűrűfű]] in the end of the 1970s but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Sometimes depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts like [[Kán, Hungary|Kán]], [[Tornakápolna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]] and [[Révfalu]].

====Bulgaria====
An increasing number of settlements in [[Bulgaria]] are becoming ghost towns as a result of the ongoing demographic decline of that country since the late 20th century. According to the 2001 [[census]] there were 138 uninhabited villages, estimated to have become over 150 by 2006. There are such ghost villages in 16 out of the 28 provinces of the country, more numerous in [[Gabrovo Province]] (57 in 2001), [[Veliko Tarnovo Province]] (34), [[Kardzhali Province|Kardzhali]], [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad]], [[Burgas Province|Burgas]], and [[Lovech Province|Lovech]] Provinces. Some Bulgarian villages may avoid that fate thanks to immigration of settlers from abroad, mainly from the [[United Kingdom]] but also other [[EU]] countries, former [[USSR|Soviet]] republics, even [[Israel]] and [[Japan]].<ref>Monitor Daily, [http://big.bg/modules/news/article.php?storyid=32394 Dr. Boris Kolev: Over 150 are the dead villages in Bulgaria], Sofia, August 8, 2006 (in Bulgarian)</ref><ref>Trud Daily, [http://www.trud.bg/default.asp?issue_date=13/8/2007&im=8&id=13&iy=2007 Foreigners colonize native villages], Sofia, August 13, 2007 (in Bulgarian)</ref>

====Czech Republic====
There is a ghost-town town in [[Milovice]], 30 km from the capital, [[Prague]]. Milovice consists of four parts and two of them, [[Milovice]]-Mladá and [[Milovice]]-Boží Dar, were occupied by Soviet soldiers and their families. These two parts were abandoned in 1990-1991 after the [[Velvet Revolution]]. The population was about 20,000. Nowadays, Mladá, the central part of Milovice, is being rebuilt and many young people live there. Boží Dar, as well as the nearby airport, is totally abandoned.

====Poland====
A [[Poland|Polish]] ghost town is [[Kłomino]] (near to [[Borne Sulinowo]]; Russian name - Gródek/Гродек) in the northwest part of the country. It was built for Soviet soldiers and their families. The population was about 5,000. It was completely abandoned in 1992 after the collapse of the USSR. Only a few families live there now, but there are plans to repopulate the city.

====Ukraine====
{{See also |Prypiat, Ukraine}}

[[Prypiat, Ukraine|Prypiat]] is one of the biggest ghost towns today because at its peak, it had a population of over 50,000 residents; all have abandoned the town after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Prypiat was built to be the home for the workers of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. Unlike its neighboring town [[Chernobyl]], Prypiat remains a ghost town and is completely empty.

===[[Post-Soviet states]]===
Apart from [[Prypiat]], the majority of abandoned towns and settlements are located in northern Russia ([[Komi Republic|Komi]], [[Taymyr Autonomous Okrug|Taymyr]], [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]]). They were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crisis of the early 1990s. Other notable ghost towns are attributed to the [[post-Soviet conflicts]]. An example is [[Agdam]], [[Azerbaijan]]. Semi-deserted towns are situated in [[Abkhazia]], notably [[Tquarchal]], [[Ochamchira]]<ref>[http://www.undp.org.ge/news/agricabh.pdf]</ref>, [[Gagra]], the biggest being [[Sukhumi]].

In European [[Russia]], many villages have been depopulated since the 1940s.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6465/is_200305/ai_n25686585]</ref>

===Middle East===
The southern part of [[Famagusta]], also known as [[Varosha (Famagusta)|Varosha]]/Maraş is fenced of by Turkish army. Prior to the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, it was the modern tourist area of the city of [[Famagusta]]. For the last three decades, it has been left as a [[ghost town]].

====Turkey====
[[Kayaköy]] in southwestern [[Turkey]] was inhabited by Anatolian Greeks, until 1923 when a population exchange was agreed by the Turkish and Greek governments which left the town as a site of empty houses and Greek churches. 

====Oman====
The city of Sap Bani Khamis <ref>[http://www.omanclimbing.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=398 Sap Bani Khamis]</ref> is a abandoned town, previously inhabited by thieves. 

====Other====
There are many ghost villages in [[Iran]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] abandoned as a result of migration to major cities. Most of these towns are in ruins and a few serve as tourist attractions. In addition, the Syrian city of [[Quneitra]] has become a ghost town after the 1967 Six Day War and subsequent Yom Kippur war in 1973.

===Asia===


====Pakistan====
[[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo Daro]], two ancient cities in current day [[Pakistan]], have such good quality bricks displaying the creativity of the ancient people, that they still stand to their original forms up to 75%.

====India====
In addition, numerous cities in [[India]], such as [[Vijaynagar]], [[Bhangarh]], [[Dhanushkodi]], and others, have been known to have been destroyed or turned into ghost towns.

====Japan====
[[Hashima Island]] was a [[Japan]]ese mining town from 1887 to 1974. Once known for having the world's highest population density (in 1959 at 83,500 people per square kilometer), the island was abandoned when the coal mines were closed down.

===Africa===
Actions by government forces and killings by armed gangs created several deserted villages in the [[Central African Republic]] from the years 2005 to 2008. Examples are [[Goroumo]], [[Beogombo Deux]] and [[Paoua]].<ref name="BBC">{{cite web | title=Massacre haunts CAR villagers | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7788626.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2008-12-18 |accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Deserted villages and abandoned lives | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7779000/7779890.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref>

====Angola====
[[Ilha dos Tigres]]. This town lies in a zone which is ideally suited for ecologic projects. It was mentioned in the 'Unknown Africa-Angola' documentary <ref>[http://www.photographersdirect.com/buyers/stockphoto.asp?imageid=1499259 Unknown Africa-Ilha dos Tigres]</ref>

====D.R. Congo====
[[Goma]]. Goma is again a safe ghost-town now that the volcano eruption has passed. Still, however, the town lies in ruins. <ref>[http://us-africa.tripod.com/news.html Goma]</ref>

====Mali====
Though not completely abandoned, [[Chinguetti]] could be considered a ghost town.

====Morocco====
In [[Morocco]] a significant archaeological site, ''[[Chellah]]'', was inhabited successively by [[Phoenician]]s, Romans and native rulers: however, Chellah was almost totally abandoned and became a ghost town in the 13th century [[AD]], when the ruling dynasty relocated to [[Fes]]; the site was resettled by the [[Merinid]] Dynasty within the next century and re-used as a [[necropolis]] and [[mosque]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2007) ''Chellah'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham, [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17910]</ref>

====Namibia====
Outside [[Luderitz]], [[Namibia]] there are two ghost towns, [[Elizabeth Bay (Ghost Town)|Elizabeth Bay]] and [[Kolmanskop]]. Both were diamond mining towns and have been partly covered by the shifting sands of the [[Namib Desert]]. 

====Tunisia====
There is also the ancient city of [[Carthage]], which was rendered a ghost town by the Romans, revived by the same empire, and then destroyed again a few centuries later, with [[Tunis]] becoming the central city. Suburban settlement later occurred in the Carthage area.

====Ethiopia====
[[Dallol (town)|Dallol]] is a former mining town in Ethiopia. It is located in the [[Dallol]] crater, where the temperature can rise as high as 104 °Fahrenheit (40 °C). Therefore, it was the hottest inhabited place on Earth when people lived there.{{fact|date=April 2008}}

====Ivory Coast====
[[Grand Bassam]], [[Ivory Coast]] was the French Colonial capital of Ivory Coast until 1896, when it was abandoned by the French Colonial Government. Commercial activity gradually weakened until the city became a virtual ghost town in 1960, when the Ivory Coast became independent. Today the city has revived somewhat as a tourist and crafts center, but still has the aura of a ghost town, because large areas of the city, including some of its largest buildings, have been empty for decades.
