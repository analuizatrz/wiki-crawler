'''Endoscopic foreign body retrieval''' refers to the removal of ingested objects from the [[esophagus]], [[stomach]] and [[duodenum]] by [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] techniques.  It does not involve [[surgery]], but rather encompasses a variety of techniques employed through the [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscope]] for grasping [[foreign bodies]], manipulating them, and removing them while protecting the esophagus and [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]].<ref name=ASGE>Eisen GM, Baron TH, Dominitz JA, Faigel DO, Goldstein JL, Johanson JF, Mallery JS, Raddawi HM, Vargo JJ 2nd, Waring JP, Fanelli RD, Wheeler-Harbough J; American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

Management of foreign bodies of the upper gastrointestinal tract: update.  ''Gastrointest Endosc.'' 1995 Jan;41(1):39-51.

Commonly swallowed objects include [[coin]]s, [[button]]s, [[battery (electrical)|batteries]], and small bones (such as fish bones),<ref name=ASGE/> but can include more complex objects, such as [[eyeglasses]],<ref name=Grover>Grover SC, Kim YI, Kortan PP, Marcon NE.

==Indications and contraindications==
Some patients at risk for foreign body ingestion may not be able to give an accurate [[medical history]] of ingestion, either due to [[Ageing|age]] or mental illness.  It is important that physicians treating these patients recognize the [[symptom]]s of esophageal foreign body impaction requiring urgent intervention. Most frequently, these include drooling and the inability to swallow [[saliva]], neck tenderness, [[Vomiting|regurgitation]] of food, [[stridor]] and [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]] if there is compression of the trachea.<ref name=ASGE/><ref>Nandi P, Ong GB.  Foreign body in the oesophagus: review of 2394 cases.  ''Br J Surg.'' 1978 Jan;65(1):5-9.  PMID 623968</ref>

There are several situations in which endoscopic techniques are not indicated, such as for small blunt objects less than 2.5 cm which have already passed into the stomach (as these usually do not obstruct anywhere else), when there is [[Boerhaave syndrome|perforation of the esophagus]] or [[mediastinitis]] (inflammation of structures around the esophagus), and for [[narcotic]]-containing bags or [[condom]]s that have been ingested, because of the risk of overdose if they are ruptured.<ref name=ASGE/>

Foreign bodies should be removed from the esophagus within 24 hours of ingestion because of a high risk of complication.<ref>Chaikhouni A, Kratz JM, Crawford FA.  Foreign bodies of the esophagus.  ''Am Surg.'' 1985 Apr;51(4):173-9.  PMID 3985482</ref>

==Non-invasive testing==

Prior to undertaking endoscopy, attempts should be made to locate the foreign body with [[x-ray]]s or other [[Non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive techniques]].<ref name=ASGE/>  For radio-opaque objects, x-rays of the neck, chest and abdomen can be used to locate the foreign body and assist endoscopy.<ref>Lane JE, Boltri JM.  Imaging gastric pennies in children.  ''Emerg Radiol.'' 2005 Apr;11(3):180-2.  PMID 16028326</ref>  Alternative approaches, including the use of [[metal detector]]s, have also been described.<ref>Ramlakhan SL, Burke DP, Gilchrist J.  Things that go beep: experience with an ED guideline for use of a handheld metal detector in the management of ingested non-hazardous metallic foreign bodies.  ''Emerg Med J.'' 2006 Jun;23(6):456-60.  PMID 16714508</ref>

X-rays are also useful for identifying the type of foreign body ingested and complications of foreign body ingestion, including mediastinitis and perforation of the esophagus.<ref name=ASGE/>

==Endoscopy==
[[Endoscopy|Endoscopic]] retrieval involves the use of a gastroscope or an optic fiber [[charge-coupled device]] camera. This instrument is shaped as a long tube, which is inserted through the [[mouth]] into the esophagus and stomach to identify the foreign body or bodies.  This procedure is typically performed under [[conscious sedation]].  Many techniques have been described to remove foreign bodies from the stomach and esophagus.  Usually the esophagus is protected with an overtube (a plastic tube of varying length), through which the gastroscope and retrieved objects are passed.<ref>Smith MT, Wong RK.  Esophageal foreign bodies: types and techniques for removal.  ''Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol.'' 2006 Feb;9(1):75-84.</ref>

Once the foreign body has been identified with the gastroscope, various devices can be passed through the gastroscope to grasp or manipulate the foreign body. Devices used include [[forceps]], which come in varying shapes, sizes and grips,<ref name=Seo>Seo JK.  Endoscopic management of gastrointestinal foreign bodies in children.  ''Indian J Pediatr.'' 1999;66(1 Suppl):S75-80.  PMID 11132474</ref> [[snare device|snare]]s, and oval loops that can be retracted from outside the gastroscope to [[lasso]] objects,<ref>Chen SC, Yu SC, Yuan RH, Chang KJ.  Endoscopic removal of a large gastric metallic watch with a polypectomy snare loop.  ''Endoscopy.'' 1997 Nov;29(9):S55-6.  PMID 9476781 </ref> as well as [[Roth basket]]s (mesh nets that can be closed to trap small objects),<ref>Neustater B, Barkin JS.  Extraction of an esophageal food impaction with a Roth retrieval net.  ''Gastrointest Endosc.'' 1996 Jan;43(1):66-7.  PMID 8903823.</ref> and  [[magnet]]s placed at the end of the scope or at the end of [[nasogastric tube|orogastric tubes]].<ref name=Seo/><ref>Yamauchi K, Kobayashi T, Shinomiya T, Fujiwara D, Ito W, Onoda T, Yozai K, Ishii T, Nanamiya W, Sumiyoshi R, Ono T, Tamai M, Yamane Y, Suzaki N.  Device for the removal of button batteries.  ''Intern Med.'' 2001 Jan;40(1):9-13.  PMID 11201377</ref> Some techniques have been described that use [[foley catheter]]s to trap objects, or use two snares to orient foreign bodies.<ref name=Aoyagi />
