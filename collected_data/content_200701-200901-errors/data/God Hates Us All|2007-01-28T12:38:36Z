'''''God Hates Us All''''' is the eighth studio album by American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]. The album was recorded in [[Vancouver]] at [[The Warehouse Studio]]. After three delays due to artwork and remixing concerns, it was finally released through [[American Recordings]] on [[September 11]], [[2001]]. 

==Recording==
The band decided to record the record in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] for two reasons. It was cheaper then a [[Hollywood]] recording studio and producer Matt Hyde had previously worked in the studio. Guitarists [[Jeff Hanneman]] stated "It will be cheaper, there'll be no distractions."<ref name="liveDaily Interview: Slayer">{{cite web

==Lyrical themes==
The songs "Deviants" and "God Send Death", written by Hanneman are about the idea of killing people for fun. "I've read a bunch of books, and I put a lot of thought into it, and I figured out I'm really not a serial killer. I could kill somebody if they pissed me off, but I couldn't kill someone I didn't know, just for the power of it. I was really trying to get into that person's mind. Why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted to get into that mindset." states Hanneman. Vocalist [[Tom Araya]] had no contribution to the lyrics of the record.<ref name="liveDaily Interview: Slayer"/>

==Controversy==
The original album cover depicted a [[Bible]] covered in blood, with nails pushed in specific places to form a [[pentagram]] star, and with "Slayer" burnt into the front cover. A slip insert was created to be placed in front of the real cover in stores. This sleeve depicts the name of the band, four [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] [[Christian cross|Latin crosses]] in the form of a cross crosslet, and the name of the album in [[gold (color)|gold]] on a [[white]] background.

Despite its title and the original cover, the band was at pains to point out that the album was not a return to the horror-influenced "Satanic" lyrics of the past(despite the fact that much of the lyrics present on the album are very anti-religious, and much of the merchandise on the subsequent tours contained Satanic artwork). Kerry King has stated that the title "God Hates Us All" is a reference to having a bad day, one where you feel like God hates you.

As the album's release coincided with the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 Terrorist Attacks]], promotional posters were taken down almost immediately, as the title "God Hates Us All" would likely prove offensive to some.

The band used [[seven-string guitar]]s on the tracks "Warzone" and "Here Comes The Pain", the first time they had done so.

==Response==
The album debuted at number 29 on the [[Billboard 200]],<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web
