In March 2007, Gambito's video ''Mixed Nuts'' was nominated for the 2006 YouTube Video Awards for Best Comedy,<ref name=DMW>{{Cite news | url = http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2007/03/22/buzz-watch-happyslip-nominated-for-2006-youtube-video-award | author = Jay Braage | date = 2007-03-22 | title = Buzz Watch: HappySlip Nominated for 2006 YouTube Video Award | accessdate = 2007-08-21 | work = [[Digital Media Wire]]}}</ref> resulting in the second place.<ref name = "YT-AWDS-COM">{{cite news |title= 2006 YouTube Video Awards Results | url=http://www.youtube.com/ytawards?name=ytcomedy |publisher= [[YouTube]]}}</ref>  In May of the same year, she became one of the first YouTube users accepted into YouTube's revenue sharing program.<ref name=NYT>{{Cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/technology/05tube.html?ex=1187841600&en=ae6940b91e2b4aac&ei=5070 | title = Contributors on YouTube May Share Advertising Revenue | date = 2007-05-05 | accessdate = 2007-08-21 | author = Miguel Helft | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Gambito's performances typically include comedy sketches in which she impersonates members of her family.  She also sings and plays the piano or guitar. As Gambito has stated repeatedly in her videos, she is notably one of the very few top users acting, filming, editing and producing her shorts completely on her own.<ref>''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCtQ2G3geo Vlog #2]'', HappySlip's Channel on [[YouTube]]</ref><ref name=AS>{{Cite news | author = Jet Damazo | url = http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=451&Itemid=34 | title = A Filipina's Happy Slip is Showing | work = [[Asia Sentinel]] | date = 2007-04-13 | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref>

==Before YouTube==
Born and raised in [[Virginia]] and of [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ethnicity, she studied and graduated in nursing while obtaining several [[cameo appearance]]s and small parts in television commercials and movies, [[industrial film| industrial]] and [[training film]]s.<ref name=AJ>{{Cite news | author = | url = http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=124&a=18951 | title = Tuned in to 'Happy Slip': Getting to Know Christine Gambito | work = Asian Journal Online | date = 2007-03-20 | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref>

==The nickname==
Gambito attributes her nickname "HappySlip" to her Filipino mother's mispronunciation of "[[half slip]]":

{{cquote|As a child, my Filipino mom would always remind me to wear a half-slip with skirts. However, the way she would pronounce the phrase was misleading: "Your hap e-slip! Be sure to wear your hap e-slip!" So I naturally went around calling the thing a 'happy slip,' until friends at school corrected me by asking if I had a 'sad slip' as well.<ref name=BS>{{Cite news | author = Christine Gambito | url = http://www.backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/features/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003562978 | title = My YouTube, Myself  | work = [[Back Stage]] | date = 2007-03-26 | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref>}}

At her personal site, she explains that the phrase is not only a funny phrase from the past, but it also reflects what she would like people to feel when they watch her videos, hoping they will “slip into happiness” while watching. <ref>[http://www.happyslip.com/about/ Happyslip's Official website]</ref>

==Videos==
[[Image:Mixed.JPG|left|thumb|Gambito in "Mixed Nuts"]]Her first [[sketch]], ''Instant video blogging'',<ref>''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCtQ2G3geo Instant video blogging]'', HappySlip's Channel on [[YouTube]]</ref> was originally broadcasted on September 6, 2006 and featured Gambito impersonating four different characters, each representing a different video blogging style. Due to the positive response she received from the YouTube community, two of those characters (the teenager and the girl in the "soap opera" style) were explored further in the following videos, the latter becoming the first episode of a [[soap opera]] spoof featuring two twin sisters both interpreted by Gambito.
Her second video introduced many of the [[Leitmotif| recurring theme]]s in her following sketches, such as her parents' attitude towards her growing popularity over the Internet and her family's ethnic habits seen through the mind of an American.
Other notable sketches include ''Mixed Nuts''<ref>''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3y_hX0noR0 Mixed nuts]'', HappySlip's Channel on [[YouTube]]</ref> — a video depicting what she would call "a typical family discussion" which was later awarded with the second place in the 2006 YouTube Video Awards for Best Comedy<ref name = "YT-AWDS-COM" /> — and ''Mac Beautiful'',<ref>''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsqi2QHXaFI Mac beautiful]'', HappySlip's Channel on [[YouTube]]</ref> her first musical video, an ironic cover of the song [[You're Beautiful]] by [[James Blunt]] praising the beauty and efficiency of her 12" [[Apple PowerBook]] computer. Gambito later broadcast two videos containing original songs.<ref>''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUDDAyT3FnY Your Love]'', HappySlip's Channel on [[YouTube]]</ref><ref>''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHN0pTeI5K0 Happy Mother's Day]'', HappySlip's Channel on [[YouTube]]</ref>
