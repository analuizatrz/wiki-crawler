The '''Susquehanna River''', originally Sasquesahanough as per the 1612 [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]] map, is a [[river]] in the northeastern [[United States]]. At approximately 444&nbsp;[[mile|mi]] (715&nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]]) long, it is the longest river on the American East Coast. The Susquehanna forms from two main branches, with the North Branch, which rises in upstate [[New York]] often regarded as an extension of the main branch. The shorter [[West Branch Susquehanna River|West Branch]], which rises in western [[Pennsylvania]], is sometimes regarded as the principal tributary, joining the North Branch near [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]] in central Pennsylvania. The river drains a large watershed within the [[Allegheny Plateau]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], cutting through [[water gap]]s in the lateral mountain ridges in a broad zigzag course to flow across the rural heartland of southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern [[Maryland]], emptying in the north end of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], the [[ria]] of the Susquehanna.

==Description==
[[Image:susq.png|right|Susquehanna River watershed]]
Rising as the outlet of [[Otsego Lake]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]], the north branch of the river runs west-southwest through dairy country, receiving the [[Unadilla River]] at [[Sidney, New York|Sidney]] and the [[Chenango River|Chenango]] in downtown [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]]. At [[Athens Township, Pennsylvania|Athens]] in northern Pennsylvania, just across the New York state line, it receives the [[Chemung River|Chemung]] from the northwest and makes a right angle curve between Sayre and [[Towanda, Pennsylvania|Towanda]] to cut through the [[Endless Mountains]] in the [[Allegheny Plateau]]. It receives the [[Lackawanna River]] southwest of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and turns sharply to the southwest, flowing through the former anthracite industrial heartland in the mountain ridges of northeastern Pennsylvania, past [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Berwick, Pennsylvania|Berwick]], [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]], and [[Danville, Pennsylvania|Danville]]. It receives the smaller West Branch from the northwest at [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania|Northumberland]], just above Sunbury.

[[Image:Harrisburg 0127.jpg|300px|left|thumb|[[Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], with the state capitol dome from across the Susquehanna River]]
Downstream from the confluence of its branches it flows south past [[Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania|Selinsgrove]], where it is joined by its [[Penns Creek]] tributary, and cuts through a water gap at the western end of [[Mahantongo]] Mountain. It receives the [[Juniata River]] from the northwest at [[Duncannon, Pennsylvania|Duncannon]], then passes through its last water gap, through [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Mountain]] Pennsylvania, just northwest of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. It passes downtown Harrisburg (where it is nearly a mile wide), the largest city on the lower river, and flows southeast across south-central Pennsylvania, forming the border between [[York County, Pennsylvania|York]] and [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] counties, as well as receiving [[Swatara Creek]] from the northeast. It crosses into northern [[Maryland]] approximately 30&nbsp;miles (50&nbsp;km) northeast of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], where it is joined by [[Octoraro Creek]].  Finally the river enters the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay at [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]], where [[Concord Point Light]] was built in 1827 to accommodate the increasing navigational traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lhdigest.com/Digest/StoryPage.cfm?StoryKey=1004

==Geology==
[[Geology|Geologically]], the river is extremely ancient, often regarded as the oldest or second oldest major system in the world. It is far older than the [[Appalachian Mountains|mountains]] through which it turns - the flow of the ancient Susquehanna was so strong that it was able to cut through the mountains even as they were forming from the collision of Africa and North America some 300&nbsp;million years ago. Remarkably, the river's age means that it actually predates the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Before the end of the last ice age, the Susquehanna was a much longer river. The Chesapeake Bay constituted its lower valley before it was flooded by rising waters at the conclusion of the [[Pleistocene]], a formation known as a [[ria]].

==Pollution==
[[Image:Susquehanna ETM 19990923 lrg.jpg|thumb|250px|Satellite photo of the Susquehanna(upper left) where it empties into Chesapeake Bay(center).]]
The environmental group '''American Rivers''' named the Susquehanna "America's Most Endangered River for 2005" due to the excessive pollution it receives. Most of the pollution in the river is due to excess animal manure, agricultural runoff, urban and suburban stormwater, and raw or inadequately treated sewage. In 2003 the river alone contributed 44% of the nitrogen, 21% of the phosphorus, and 21% of the sediment flowing into the Chesapeake Bay. Pennsylvania may be subject to [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] sanctions if it does not reduce its pollution in the watershed by 2010. [http://www.cbf.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=10769]
It was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Historic importance==
The river has played an enormous role throughout the history of the United States. Before European conquest, the [[Susquehannock]], an Iroquoian tribe lived along the river and gave the Susquenanna its name. In the 17th century, it was inhabited largely by the [[Lenape]], forming roughly the western boundary of their inhabited territory, known as [[Lenapehoking]]. In the 18th century, [[William Penn]], the founder of the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Colony]], negotiated with the Lenape to allow white settlement in the colony between the [[Delaware River]] and the Susquehanna. Local legend claims that the name of the river comes from an Indian phrase meaning "mile wide, foot deep," referring to the Susquehanna's unusual dimensions, but while the word is [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], it simply means "muddy water."

In the late colonial times, the river became an increasingly important transportation corridor with the discovery of [[anthracite coal]] by Necho Allen in its upper reaches in the mountains. In 1792, the [[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal]] was proposed linking the Susquehanna and the Delaware along Swatara Creek and [[Tulpehocken Creek (Pennsylvania)|Tulpehocken Creek]]. In the 19th century, the river became the scene of the growth of industrial centers.

Conflicting land claims by Pennsylvania and [[Connecticut]] to the [[Wyoming Valley]] along the Susquehanna led to the founding of [[Westmoreland County, Connecticut]] and the [[Pennamite Wars]], which eventually led to the territory being ceded to Pennsylvania. 

During the [[American Civil War]]'s 1863 [[Gettysburg Campaign]], the commander of the [[Department of the Susquehanna]], [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major General]] [[Darius N. Couch]] resolved that [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] would not cross the Susquehanna. He positioned [[militia]] units under Maj. [[Granville Haller]] to protect key bridges in Harrisburg and [[Wrightsville, Pennsylvania|Wrightsville]], as well as nearby fords. Confederate forces approached the river at several locations in [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland]] and [[York County, Pennsylvania|York]] counties, but were recalled on [[June 29]] when Lee chose to concentrate his army to the west.

In [[1972]], the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] stalled over the New York-Pennsylvania border, dropping as much as 20&nbsp;inches (50.8&nbsp;cm) of rain on the hilly lands. Much of that precipitation was received into the Susquehanna from its western tributaries, and the valley suffered disastrous flooding. [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], was among the hardest hit communities. The [[Chesapeake Bay]] received so much fresh water that it killed much of the marine life.

In [[1979]], the river was the scene of the most serious [[nuclear power]] accident in U.S. history at [[Three Mile Island]] southeast of Harrisburg.

==Bridges, canals and dams==
{{sectstub}}
{{seealso|List of crossings of the Susquehanna River}}
{{seealso|List of dams and reservoirs of the Susquehanna River}}

The Susquehanna River has always loomed large in the transportation history of the [[United States]].  Prior to the 1818 opening of the [[Port Deposit Bridge]], the river formed a barrier between the northern and southern states, crossable only by ferry.  The earliest dams were constructed to support ferry operations in low water.  The presence of many rapids in the river meant that while commercial traffic could navigate down the river in the spring thaws, nothing could move up.  This led to the construction of two different canal systems on the Susquehanna, the first by the [[Proprietors of the Susquehanna Canal]] and later the [[Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal]].  The canals required additional dams to provide canal water and navigation pools.  As the industrial age progressed, bridges replaced ferries, and railroads replaced canals, often built right on top of the canal right of way along the river. Many canal remnants can be seen in [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]], along [[US Route 15]] in Pennsylvania, and in upstate New York at various locations. 
 
Today, there are over two hundred bridges crossing the Susquehanna, the sole remaining ferry is a seasonal tourist attraction, the canals are gone or are part of historical parks, and dams are related to power generation or recreation. Perhaps the most famous of these bridges, the [[Rockville Bridge]], crosses the river  from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] to [[Marysville, Pennsylvania]]. The Rockville Bridge is the largest stone and concrete arch bridge in the world.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It was built by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in the early 1900s, replacing an earlier iron bridge.
