'''Swiftfox''' is a modification of [[Mozilla Firefox]] for [[Linux]]-based platforms, with [[Software build|builds]] optimized for different [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] processors, made by Jason Halme. Swiftfox is freely downloadable, with [[open source]] code and [[proprietary]] binaries. Several versions of Swiftfox are available, each with a separate download for a specific type of [[Microprocessor|microprocessor architecture]]. Firefox [[Extension (Mozilla)|extensions]] and [[plugins]] are compatible with Swiftfox, with notable exceptions. The name Swiftfox comes from the animal [[Swift Fox]]. Swiftfox differs from Firefox by a limited number of changes, and builds for different processors. As these differences are technical, for general information on the browser see [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]].

== Optimization ==
The Swiftfox build is optimized using the following methods:

'''Binary code optimization'''
*Compiled with the highest level of [[compiler optimization]], rather than optimization for binary size.
** Swiftfox is compiled -O3,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://forums.getswiftfox.com/viewtopic.php?t=44 | title=Swiftfox Forum}}</ref><ref name=build20>Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds</ref> (the highest level)
***The resulting Swiftfox binary is larger than Firefox. (It should be noted that -O3 is not necessarily faster than -O2, or -Os.  -O3 introduces two more options on top of -O2: -finline-functions and -frename-registers.  The latter is good for CPUs with many registers but may actually be slower on other CPUs.<ref name=gccopt>{{cite web | url=http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.1/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options | title=Optimize Options - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)}}</ref>)
**Firefox is compiled -Os<ref name=build20>Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds</ref>. (-Os is the same as -O2 but removes optimizations which would increase the binary size <ref name=gccopt/>.)
*[[Binary file|Binaries]] incorporate additional [[instruction set]]s.<ref name=change20>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/mozilla_1_8_branch/changelog | title=Swiftfox 2.0pre changelog}}</ref>
** [[Intel]] and [[AMD]]: [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], [[SSE2]], (not generally [[SSE3]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://forums.getswiftfox.com/viewtopic.php?t=11&highlight=sse3 | title=Swiftfox Forum}}</ref>).
** [[AMD]] only: [[3DNow!]]
*Optimization specific to the build microprocessor architecture.<ref name=change20>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/mozilla_1_8_branch/changelog | title=Swiftfox 2.0pre changelog}}</ref>
** [[Intel]]: [[Pentium 4]], [[Pentium III|Pentium 3]], [[Pentium M]], [[Pentium III|Pentium 3M]], [[Pentium 2]], [[Pentium 4#Prescott|Prescott]].
** [[AMD64]]: [[Athlon64]] (32bit binary).
** [[AMD]]: [[Athlon XP]], [[Athlon]], [[K6-2]].
*Compiled with newer version of [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (Firefox 2.0 uses 3.3.2, Swiftfox 2.0 uses 4.0.4).<ref name=build20>Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds</ref>
'''Increased Security'''
*Better protection from [[Buffer overflow]] attacks<ref name=fortify>{{cite web | url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/009jul05/features/execshield/#checks | title=redhat.com | Limiting buffer overflows with ExecShield}}</ref> (Swiftfox 2.0 uses -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2; Firefox 2.0 uses gcc 3.x, which does not support this).<ref name=build20>Using url of ''about:buildconfig'' to check the details of the 2.0 builds</ref>
'''Simplify'''
*[[Pango]] is not included in the build {{Fact|date=April 2007}}. This means that [[Unicode typefaces|Unicode fonts]] remain supported (see [[Unicode and HTML]]), but without certain extra features<ref name=pangoexample>{{cite web | url=http://www.pango.org/ScriptGallery | title=Script Gallery - Pango }}</ref> provided by [[Pango]]. This simplification reduces the binary size, and reduces rendering.
'''Changed default preference values'''
*[[IPv6]] [[Domain name system|DNS]] lookups are disabled.<ref name=change15>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/releases/changelog | title=Swiftfox 1.5.0.7 changelog}}</ref><ref name=change20>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/mozilla_1_8_branch/changelog | title=Swiftfox 2.0pre changelog}}</ref> preventing slowdowns experienced<ref name=ipv6dns>{{cite web | url=http://forums.getswiftfox.com/viewtopic.php?p=12&sid=f37125f87effd7be076c6c748cdde960 | title=Swiftfox Forum}}</ref>
*[[HTTP pipelining]] is enabled by default.<ref name=change15>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/releases/changelog | title=Swiftfox 1.5.0.7 changelog}}</ref><ref name=change20>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/builds/mozilla_1_8_branch/changelog | title=Swiftfox 2.0pre changelog}}</ref> Note that [[Fasterfox]] provides a [[GUI]] to adjust these settings.

== Speed ==
=== Firefox speed ===
Firefox has been criticised for slow startup compared with other browsers <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/Mozilla-Firefox-Review-13677.shtml | title = Mozilla Firefox 1.5 Final Review | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = [[November 30]], [[2005]] | last = Muradin | first = Alex | publisher = Softpedia | accessdate = 2006-09-22}}</ref>, a criticism confirmed by pre-Firefox 2.0 speed tests.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/Mozilla-Firefox-Review-13677.shtml  | title = Mozilla Firefox Review | work = Softpedia | accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref><ref name=benchgeneral>{{cite web | url=http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html | title=Browser speed comparisons}}</ref> A speed comparison of various Linux (and other) browsers has been done.<ref name=benchgeneral>{{cite web | url=http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html | title=Browser speed comparisons}}</ref>

=== Swiftfox speed ===
No definitive benchmarking has been reported, but a quicker startup time and a 1.7% webpage rendering speedup has been reported on the 1.5.0.6 version.<ref name=benchswift>{{cite web | url=http://www.apcstart.com/node/3097 | title=APC Magazine: What's The Worlds Fastest Browser| accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref> . There are no benchmarks for the different processors builds.

== Additional options ==
Swiftfox is bundled with the following freely available Firefox plugins and extensions:
*[[XForms]] extension is installed and enabled
*libunixprintplugin.so plugin is installed

== Downloads available == 
*The latest released version of Firefox 2.0 - separate builds are available for each processor type covering [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] processors:
** packaged as a [[tar (file format)|tar]] file
** packaged for [[Debian]] installs
*Recent snapshots of development versions of Firefox 2.0 and 3.0 (trunk) - separate builds for [[AMD]] [[Athlon XP]] processors and [[Intel]] [[Pentium 4]] (and compatible).

== License ==
The same as Firefox, the Swiftfox source code is [[open source]], with the source code under [[Mozilla Public License|MPL 1.1]] except for parts relating to branding.<ref name=license/>
Unlike Firefox, the Swiftfox binaries have a proprietary license<ref name=license>{{cite web | url=http://getswiftfox.com/LICENSE | title=Swiftfox license}}</ref> which does not allow redistribution. According to the author, this is to prevent the possibility of any confusion with tainted versions (see the Firefox branding argument [[Mozilla Firefox#Trademark and logo issues]]). The name Swiftfox is trademarked by Jason Halme, and accordingly cannot be used on other third party Firefox builds without his permission.

=== Debian ===
Swiftfox binaries are available as [[deb (file format)|Debian packages]] from [http://getswiftfox.com/debian.htm official site]. Note that the proprietary binary license prevents Debian and other Linux distributions from having Swiftfox available as part of a distribution.

== Alternatives ==
* Firefox source code and Swiftfox changes are freely available for download, allowing anyone to create their own build.
* [[Swiftweasel]] is an optimized build of the Mozilla Firefox code that is licensed under the [[Mozilla Public License|MPL 1.1]].
