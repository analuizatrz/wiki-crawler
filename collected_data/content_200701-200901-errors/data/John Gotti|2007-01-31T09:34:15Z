{{otherpeople|John Gotti}}
'''John Joseph Gotti, Jr.''' ([[October 27]], [[1940]] &ndash; [[June 10]], [[2002]]) (also known as '''The Dapper Don''' and '''The Teflon Don''') or '''John Gotti''' was an [[United States|American]] [[mafioso]] and was the [[crime boss|don]] of the [[Gambino crime family]], one of the [[Five Families|five major]] [[New York City]] [[mafia]] families, from [[1986]] to [[1992]]. He became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style that made him the poster child for mobsters, an image that persists even today. 

==Career==
John Gotti was born '''John Joseph Gotti, Jr.''' to John Gotti Sr. and Fannie (Philomena) Gotti in [[The Bronx, New York]]. Fannie and John Gotti Sr. had thirteen children, two of whom died in infancy. His family  moved into a tough neighborhood in [[Brooklyn]] when he was 12. He had four brothers that also went into the Mafia life: [[Peter Gotti|Peter]], [[Gene Gotti|Gene]], [[Richard V. Gotti|Richard]] and to a lesser degree, [[Vincent Gotti|Vincent]]. Peter, Gene and Richard were all "made members" of the Gambino family as was John.
		
Gotti allegedly started as a mob [[hitman]], he worked under Captain [[Carmine Fatico]] and worked his way up to becoming [[Caporegime|captain]] of one of the most powerful crews in the Gambino family. His crew, however, was allegedly caught selling [[narcotics|drugs]], against the rules of the family, and was about to be disbanded.  Gotti and others in the family were not happy with the way that Castellano was running the family and allegedly organized the shooting of the Gambino family boss, [[Paul Castellano]], on [[December 16]], [[1985]]. Castellano was shot six times, along with his [[bodyguard]], Thomas Bilotti, outside [[Sparks Steak House]] in Manhattan and Gotti allegedly took control of the family.

Following his purported ascension to the top position of the Gambino family, Gotti became known as "The Dapper Don," appearing in public wearing $10,000 hand-tailored [[Brioni]] suits and reveling in media attention. Gotti was extremely popular in his Queens neighborhood, where he organized free lavish street parties and festivals, and had a reputation for keeping [[street crime]] out. The annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] party he hosted near his [[Bergen Hunt and Fish Club]] in [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park]], a neighborhood in [[Queens]], which featured an elaborate fireworks display, was a major media event. 

Gotti was arrested several times throughout his career, and although he served time in both state and federal prison (including a [[manslaughter]] conviction in connection with the shooting death of a low-level [[Irish-American]] gangster named James McBratney in a tavern on [[Staten Island]] in 1973), in the 1980s he was referred to by the media as the "Teflon Don" as he avoided conviction on [[racketeering]] and assault charges. Gotti bribed or threatened [[jury|jurors]] in several trials. He also made use of police [[informant]]s to keep a step ahead of investigators. 	 
		 
Gotti became something of a celebrity, and would frequently shake hands and pose for pictures with tourists outside the [[Ravenite Social Club]] in Manhattan, where he conducted business.

Gotti was long under intense [[Surveillance|electronic surveillance]] run by the [[FBI]], which was led by a Vietnam war veteran, [[Bruce Mouw]]. The 7 year effort by Mouw and his colleagues trying to bring down the leadership of the Gambino Family was well documented by journalist Howard Blum in the book ''Gangland: How The FBI Broke the Mob'' in 1995. His club, phones, and other places of business were all bugged. To get around this, he held meetings while walking down the street and played loud tapes of [[white noise]]. Eventually the FBI caught him on tape in an apartment above the club allegedly discussing a number of murders and other criminal activities. The FBI also caught Gotti denigrating his underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore "Sammy The Bull" Gravano]]. Angered and feeling he would be made a [[scapegoat]], Gravano agreed to testify against Gotti. Despite having confessed to participating in 19 murders, Gravano was given only a five year sentence and then entered the [[Witness Protection Program]].

==Prison==		 
Gotti and several associates were arrested in [[1993]]. Gotti was convicted by a jury before the Honorable I. Leo Glasser in the [[United States District Court]] for the Eastern District of New York on [[April 2]], [[1992]] for 13 counts of [[murder]], [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder, [[loansharking]], [[racketeering]], [[obstruction of justice]], illegal [[gambling]], and [[tax evasion]]; along with his ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Frank LoCascio]]. Many in the public were surprised to see ([http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gravano/testifies_20.html]) actors like [[John Amos]], [[Al Lewis]], [[Mickey Rourke]] and [[Anthony Quinn]] commend Gotti's character to the press during the trial.

On June 23, Gotti was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole [http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/don_24.html?sect=15]. It was assumed that Gotti would serve his sentence at the new federal "[[supermax]]" facility at [[Florence, Colorado]], but instead he was sent to the older [[USP Marion|United States Penitentiary at Marion]] in [[Marion, Illinois]], where he was kept in a cell 23 hours a day. His cell was underground and measured eight feet by seven feet. He was allowed out of his cell one hour per day for solitary exercise in a concrete-walled enclosure. He was allowed two showers per week and one radio and a small black and white television set in his cell. Meals were delivered to his cell through a slot in the door. In other words, he was in virtual solitary confinement. Four days after John Gotti was imprisoned at Marion, his father John Gotti Sr. died of heart failure at the age of eighty-five.

==Death==	
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:SaluteGotti.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A mourner Salutes John Gotti's hearse as it travels through [[Ozone Park]] for the last time.]]	  -->
Gotti died of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] at 12:45 p.m. on [[June 10]], [[2002]] at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where he had been transferred once the cancer was diagnosed. His family claimed he had not received proper care in jail and that faulty dental work had aggravated the disease. In 2005, rumors circulated that Gotti died through AIDS-related illness, though this has never been proven. 
Following his death, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]] announced that Gotti's family would not be permitted to have a [[Mass of Christian Burial]] for Gotti. The church said that Gotti's family would be allowed to have a '''Mass for the Dead''' for Gotti only after he had been buried. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] had taken similar action against other organized crime figures as well, such as  [[Paul Castellano]]. But unlike Castellano, Gotti's family was also permitted to have him buried in the mausoleum at [[Saint John's Cemetery, Queens|Saint John's Cemetery]] in [[Queens]], next to his son Frank Gotti.

==Family== 	 
On [[March 6]], [[1962]], John Gotti married [[Vicky Gotti|Victoria DiGiorgio]], the daughter of an Italian sanitation worker and his Jewish wife, by whom he had five children: Angela (born [[1961]]), [[Victoria Gotti|Victoria]], [[Junior Gotti|John Jr.]], [[Frank Gotti|Frank]] and Peter. John and his family lived on 85th Street in [[Howard Beach, New York|Howard Beach]].

[[Frank Gotti]] died in [[1980]] when a [[Howard Beach]] neighbor, [[John Favara]], hit 12-year-old Frank with his car as he was riding a motorized mini-bike.  John Favara was abducted shortly thereafter and he was never seen again. John Gotti and wife Victoria were on vacation in Florida when [[John Favara]] disappeared.

Gotti's son John, a father of six, is known as "[[Junior Gotti]]" and was acting boss of the Gambino Crime Family after John was put in prison. "Junior" was (October 2006) facing his third trial (following two deadlocked juries) on charges of twice hiring goons who attempted to kill [[Curtis Sliwa]]. After October 2006 the authorities announced that they would not try John Gotti Jr. a third time on these charges.

Peter is an alleged associate of the Gambino Family.

In 1984 his eldest daughter Angela gave birth to a son.  John was emotionally touched when she named her son Frank, after her dead brother.

According to numerous sources, he alledgedly had two illegitimate children as the result of a longtime affair with Staten Island housewife [[Shannon Connelly|Shannon "Sandy" Connelly]], the wife of Gambino soldier [[Ed Grillo]] [http://chicagosyndicate.blogspot.com/2006_02_26_archive.html].

==Legacy==		 
In 2004, a new television show called ''[[Growing Up Gotti]]'' was aired on the [[A&E Network|A&E]] [[television network]], which features Gotti's daughter [[Victoria Gotti]], a  socialite, and her three teenage sons. Soon afterwards, [[The Smoking Gun]] website--which repeatedly refers to Gotti as a "[[serial killer]]"-- posted the videos made of Gotti and his family during a prison visit several years ago. Prison officials routinely videotaped Gotti's visits. The video, which was presented in five parts, was called ''Blowing Up Gotti'' and showed a rather paranoid, conspiratorial John Gotti ranting about his enemies, including the President at that time, [[Bill Clinton]].  

He has been the model for characters Frank Masucci and Vincent Dosso, the crime bosses in ''[[Law & Order]]'', during season 1 and season 5 down to having one son being killed by a motorist. ''[[Law & Order]]'' still uses the Masucci name.

The judge in John "Junior" Gotti's racketeering trial has declared a mistrial, according to The Associated Press. This occurred on September 27th, 2006.

On October 20, 2006, [http://wcbstv.com/topstories/local_story_293111103.html federal prosecutors decided not to re-try John A. Gotti], leaving him a free man.
