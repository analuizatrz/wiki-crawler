'''''Amanita phalloides''''', also known as the '''death cap''', is one of numerous species of [[mushroom]]s in the genus ''[[Amanita]]'', and has an infamous reputation for being the most toxic of all types of fungi. It is responsible for the majority of deaths from consumption<ref>{{cite book |author=Benjamin, D. R. |title=Amatoxin syndrome |pages=198–214}} in: {{cite book |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas — a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians |publisher=New York: W H Freeman and Company |year=1995}}</ref>. Its dangerousness is heightened by its similarity to some widely eaten species. Its [[scientific name]] ''phalloides'' means [[phallus]]-shaped.

Widely distributed across the northern hemisphere, the death cap has been accidentally introduced further afield into such countries as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

==Description==
The death cap has a large and distinctive [[fungus|fungal]] fruiting body or [[Fruiting body|''basidiocarp'']], usually with a [[pileus]] (cap) from 5 to 15&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (2–6&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) across, initially rounded and hemispherical but flattening with age. Easily peeled, the cap surface can be olive green or brown with a green to smooth yellow tinge, and is often paler after rain. There is a partial veil, white fine [[lamella]]e (gills), and a white 4 to 18&nbsp;cm long and 1 to 3&nbsp;cm-thick stipe (stalk) with an ''annulus'' (ring) and a swollen ''volva'' (base), which may be hidden by leaf litter. As the volva is a distinctive and diagnostic feature it is important to remove some debris to check for one.<ref>{{cite book | author = Jordan P. & S. Wheeler | year = 2001 | title = The Ultimate Mushroom Book | publisher = Hermes House}}</ref> 

The death cap also has white gills and a white spore print. An entirely white form (''Amanita phalloides'' var. ''alba'') is also occasionally found.  

Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg, covered by a universal veil, which then breaks leaving the volva as a remnant. 

===Similarity to edible species===
[[Asia]]n immigrants in North America, Europe, and Australia have often mistaken the death cap for the [[edible mushroom|edible]] [[paddy straw mushroom]] (''[[Volvariella volvacea]]'') due to their similarity in appearance<ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Trim, G. M., ''et. al.'' |year=1999 |title=Poisoning by ''Amanita phalloides'' ("deathcap") mushrooms in the Australian Capital Territory |journal=[[Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume=171 |pages=247–249}}</ref>. This is a leading cause of mushroom poisoning in the [[United States]]. Because of its resemblance to edible mushrooms, it is considered especially dangerous; the Finnish name ''kavalakärpässieni'' ("devious [[Amanita muscaria|fly mushroom]]") is very apt.

==Distribution and habitat==
The death cap is found primarily and originally in [[Europe]] but now is also in [[North America]], southeastern [[Australia]]<ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Reid, D. A. |year=1980 |title=A monograph of the Australian species of ''Amanita'' Pers. ex Hook (Fungi) |journal=[[Australian Journal of Botany]] - Supplementary Series No. 8 |volume=48}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Cole, F. M. |year=1993 |title=''Amanita phalloides'' in Victoria |journal=[[Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume=158 |pages=849–850}}</ref>, [[South America]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]], typically under [[oak]]s, nut trees, other [[hardwood]]s and some conifers (for example, pines), usually in autumn to early winter depending on the location.  

Initial records from North America were of the similar ''[[Amanita brunnescens]]''<ref name = "Litten75">{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Litten, W. |year=1975 |title=The most poisonous mushrooms |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=232 |issue=3 |pages=90–101}}</ref>, which was described in 1918, but ''A. phalloides'' was later confirmed in the U.S. Other similar species are ''A. subjunquillea'' in eastern [[Asia]] and ''A. arocheae'' with a range extending from Andean [[Colombia]] to central [[Mexico]] (at least). All these fungi are [[mycorrhizal]].  

''Amanita phalloides'' appears to be spreading worldwide, and has been conveyed to new countries with conifers and hardwoods.

==Toxicity==
[[Image:Death Cap Mushroom.jpg|thumb|left|Warning sign in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].]]
Death caps have been reported to taste quite pleasant.<ref name="Clel76">{{cite book | author= Cleland JB | year =1976| title = Toadstools and mushrooms and other larger fungi of South Australia | publisher = South Australian Government Printer |pages = 326 | id = ISBN }}</ref>This, coupled with the delay in symptoms is particularly dangerous. The symptoms of mushroom poisoning may be delayed by 24 to 48 hours, during which time irreparable damage may be occurring. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, intense thirst and scanty urine. Later, coma and jaundice may occur.<ref>{{cite book | last = North| first = Pamela | year = 1967 | title = Poisonous Plants and Fungi in colour | publisher = Blandford Press & Pharmacological Society of Great Britain }}</ref>

As the common name suggests, it is highly poisonous, and is responsible for the majority of fatal [[mushroom poisoning]]s worldwide. It contains two types of toxins spread throughout the mushroom [[Thallus (tissue)|thallus]]: [[phallotoxin]]s ([[phalloidin]], [[phalloin]], [[phallisin]], [[phallicidin]]) and [[amatoxin]]s ([[amanitin]], [[amanin (organic compound)|amanin]], [[amanullin]]). The toxin most responsible for the deadly effects of the death cap is [[alpha-amanitin]]. The poison particularly affects the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s; frequently the only treatment for death cap poisoning is liver [[transplant]]. It is estimated that 30&nbsp;[[gram]]s (half of a cap) of this mushroom is enough to kill a human. Poisoning can be treated by intravenous injection of [[silibinin|silibinin dihydrogen disuccinate disodium]].

The herb Milk Thistle is said to completely reverse the effects of deathcap poisoning if taken within the first 10 minutes of ingestion, and greatly reduce the chance of liver damage and death if taken within 24 hours.{{citation needed}}

* [[Pope Clement VII]] died from eating the death cap mushroom.
