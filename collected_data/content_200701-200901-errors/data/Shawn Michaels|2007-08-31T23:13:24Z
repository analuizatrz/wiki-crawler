'''Michael Shawn Hickenbottom'''<ref name="Shawn Michaels - FAQs"/> (born [[July 22]] [[1965]]),<ref name="slam">{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/michaels-shawn.html |title=SLAM! Sports biography |accessdate=2007-07-10 |publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|CANOE]]|date=March 12, 2005}}</ref>
is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by the [[ring name]] '''Shawn Michaels'''. He performs on the ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), though he is currently out of action because of a [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] knee surgery. His absence is being [[kayfabe|portrayed on television]] as the result of a serious [[concussion]] inflicted by [[Randy Orton]].<ref name="Concussion">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/exclusives/hbkconcussions|title="Is it over for HBK?"|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref>

As of 2007, Hickenbottom is one of the longest-tenured performers in WWE, having joined in 1988. He is one of only two wrestlers to have appeared on the very first episode of RAW is WAR who are still with the company today. The other is [[The Undertaker]]. However, he was inactive in the company from 1998-2002 due to a severe back injury.<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.251)</ref>

Before coming to World Wrestling Entertainment, Hickenbottom began his career in Mid-South Wrestling in 1984. He then went on to Texas All-Star Wrestling. He made his national debut with the [[American Wrestling Association]] in 1986. He signed with World Wrestling Federation in 1988 while still under contract with AWA. He returned to AWA, only to go back to World Wrestling Federation in 1990.

Hickenbottom is a four-time World Champion; three-time as [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]], and a one-time [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]]. He was also the winner of the 1995 and 1996 ''[[Royal Rumble]]s''.

==Career==
===Early career===
Michaels was born on [[July 22]], [[1965]] in [[Chandler, Arizona]]. The last of four children - Randy, Scott and Shari. He was raised in a military family, he spent a brief part of his early years in [[Reading, Berkshire]], [[England]], but mainly grew up in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of 12. He was already an athlete; his career began at the age of 6 when he started playing [[American football|Football]], becoming a stand-out [[Linebacker]]; he attended [[Randolph High School (Texas)|Randolph High School]]<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.30)</ref> and eventually becoming Captain of the football team. After graduating he attended [[Southwest Texas State University]] in [[San Marcos, Texas]]. But soon he realized that the college life was not for him. Then he began pursuing the career of a professional wrestler. 

He was then trained by [[Mexico|Mexican]] professional wrestler [[Jose Lothario]], Michaels debuted in [[1984]], working with Mid-South Wrestling and later Texas All-Star Wrestling [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], where he and [[Paul Diamond]] were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by [[Chavo Guerrero|Chavo Guerrero, Sr.]]<ref name="S.C.W. Southwest Tag Team Title">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tx/san_antonio/scw/scw-sw-t.html

Michaels also wrestled for [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Championship Wrestling]]. There, he and tag team partner [[Marty Jannetty]] defeated [[The Batten Twins]] for the Central States Tag Team Championship,<ref name="N.W.A. Central States Tag Team Title">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/centralstates/nwa/cs-t.html#cs2

Central States Tag Team Champions 86/05/15 Kansas City, KS}}</ref> later losing it back to the Battens. Michaels also made several appearances in the [[Dallas, Texas]]-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] throughout 1985.

===American Wrestling Association (1986-1988) ===
Michaels made his national-level debut in 1986 in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), once again teaming with Jannetty. The pair were billed as "[[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]]" and won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] twice.<ref name="A.W.A. World Tag Team Title">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/awa/awa-t.html

World Tag Team Champions 87/01/27 & 87/12/27 St. Paul, MN & Las Vegas, NV}}</ref> They also appeared in the Mid-South on loan at this point. In a raid of AWA talent in 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]]. However, they were fired two weeks later for "partying too hard" (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography). They returned to the AWA, but were re-signed by the WWF a year later.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1988-1998, 2002-present) ===
{{main|The Rockers}}
They redebuted at a [[house show]] on [[July 7]], [[1988]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.133)</ref> Because of WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive monikers, they were repackaged as just "[[The Rockers]]".

The energetic team proved popular with both children and women, as well as 'smart' fans who appreciated technical wrestling. The team were mid-card stalwarts of TV and pay-per-view shows for the next two years, but never seemed to get a fair chance at the WWF's Tag Team Championships.

Their chance belatedly came in October 1990: The Rockers were scheduled to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Hart Foundation]]. Jim Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.

The match was taped with The Rockers fairly winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to a stopgap agreement with management and was rehired. The belts were returned to the Harts, while the change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on TV. When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed turnbuckle in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match.

====1992-1993====
The duo plodded along, eventually splitting on [[December 2]] [[1991]] during an incident on [[Edward Leslie|Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake's]] televised "Barber Shop" talk show segment. Michaels superkicked Jannetty and [[Defenestration|threw him]] through a [[Sugar glass|glass]] window on the "shop" set. Jannetty vanished from the WWF and Michaels turned heel as "The Boy Toy". His nickname was later changed to "The Heartbreak Kid", at [[Curt Hennig]]'s suggestion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forever-shawn.net/info/facts.html|title=Forever Shawn >>> Fast Facts|accessdate=2007-07-26|publisher=Forever-shawn.net}}</ref>

In his new [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]] as a vain, cocky heel named '''The Heartbreak Kid''', he was put together with mirror-carrying [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Sherri Martel|"Sensational" Sherri]], who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him. Sherri even sang the first version of his new [[theme music]] "Sexy Boy." During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of house shows, and had his departure announced with the words "Shawn Michaels has left the building" (alluding to the phrase "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] has left the building").

Michaels failed to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Bret Hart]] in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first ever [[Ladder match]] against him at a [[House show]]. Still, Michaels was beginning to get over as a heel. He won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Davey Boy Smith|"The British Bulldog"]] during ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[October 27]] [[1992]]. Shortly thereafter, he was in a PPV main event for the first time, facing — and losing to — future nemesis Bret Hart, for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at the ''[[Survivor Series (1992)|1992 Survivor Series]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 90-91 | language = English}}</ref> They were moved to the main event after [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]] left WWF suddenly, leaving his tag-team match with [[Randy Savage]] against [[Ric Flair]] and [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] hanging. The "Champion vs. Champion" match stole the show. 

Michaels and Sherri split at this point, and Jannetty quickly reappeared, leading to several memorable matches. After sneaking past [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]] in early 1993, Michaels lost his Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night RAW]]'' on [[May 17]], [[1993]].<ref name=1993results>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1993.html|title=RAW 1993 Results|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> He then regained it on [[June 6]] [[1993]] with the help of his debuting "[[bodyguard]]" (and off-air friend) [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]].<ref name=1993results/>

After a much-hyped but ultimately disappointing feud with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]], Michaels quit the WWF in September [[1993]]. It was announced that Michaels had failed to defend his belt enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for [[steroid]]s — a charge that Michaels denies to this day. After turning down [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW's]] advances, Michaels returned to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] and made several appearances in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's ''[[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]]'', substituting for the arrested [[Jerry Lawler]] in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's "Knights" against Bret, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]], and [[Owen Hart]].<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 91-92 | language = English}}</ref>

====1994-1995====
He soon entered a feud with [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], who had won the vacated Intercontinental Title during Michaels' absence. Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt. This feud culminated in a [[ladder match]] between the two at ''[[WrestleMania X]]''. Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 92 | language = English}}</ref> This match won "Match of the Year" awards from ''Pro Wrestling Illustrated''<ref name="Match of the Year">{{cite web|url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/pwi/pwimoty.htm|title=Wrestling Information Archive - Pro Wrestling Illustrated Award Winners - Match of the Year|accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> and the ''[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''. It also earned Michaels a reputation of being the "Innovator of the Ladder Match" when, in reality, it was Bret Hart who brought in the idea two years previously from his experience in [[Stampede Wrestling]] where the Ladder Match had been used since the 1970s.

Michaels battled various injuries over the next few months and soon launched the "Heartbreak Hotel" TV talk show segment, mainly shown on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''.

On [[August 28]] [[1994]], Michaels and his ever more popular sidekick, Diesel, captured the WWF World Tag Team Championship from [[The Headshrinkers]]. During their brief time as a tag team, they used a variation of the Headshrinkers' finishing move, where Michaels finished off their opponent by climbing on Diesel's shoulders and [[professional wrestling aerial techniques#splash|splashing]] on their opponents. The next day, at ''[[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]]'', Diesel lost the Intercontinental Title to Ramon when Michaels accidentally [[Superkick]]ed his bodyguard.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 92 | language = English}}</ref> This triggered a Michaels-Diesel split, drawn out until the ''[[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]]'' that November due to Michaels' hand injury at the time.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 92-93 | language = English}}</ref> Michaels went on to win the ''[[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995 Royal Rumble]]'', where he was the first [[Royal Rumble]] participant to win the match from the No.1 spot.<ref name="Royal Rumble 1995">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/january/1995.htm|title=Royal Rumble 1995 Results|accessdate=2007-08-08|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> This set up a championship/grudge match at ''[[WrestleMania XI]]'' against Diesel. Michaels recruited [[Sid Eudy|Sid]] as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match,<ref name="PS10">{{cite news | author = Martin, Finn | title = Power Slam Magazine, issue 10 | work = "Tough luck Shawn" (WrestleMania XI) | publisher = SW Publishing. | date = 1995-04-24 | pages = 20-25 | language = English}}</ref> and was attacked by Sid the following night. Michaels took time off.

He returned to the ring as a 'babyface' in June [[1995]] and defeated [[Jeff Jarrett]] in July for his third Intercontinental Title. This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at ''[[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]]'', in a Ladder Match, which Michaels won.<ref name="PS15">{{cite news | author = Martin, Finn | title = Power Slam Magazine, issue 15 | work = "Feel the Heat" (Summer Slam 1995) | publisher = SW Publishing. | date = 1995-09-25 | pages = 18-19 | language = English}}</ref> Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as [[Clique (professional wrestling)|The Clique/Kliq]], which others perceived had sufficient clout with WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], to become the dominant wrestling figures in the promotion for several years in the mid-1990s. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers. Michaels fan base was later nicknamed "The Kliq" as an inside reference to the real "Clique." 

In October 1995, he was [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] attacked by several men outside a bar in [[Syracuse, New York]]. Shortly afterwards, at the ''[[In Your House#In Your House 4: Great White North|In Your House: Great White North]]'' PPV, Michaels forfeited the Intercontinental Title to rival [[Shane Douglas|Dean Douglas]] because he was, according to the WWF, unable to compete. However, Douglas lost the title immediately to Clique member Razor Ramon.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 94 | language = English}}</ref> Douglas maintained that Michaels could have wrestled that night and simply did not want to put him [[over (professional wrestling)|over]].

The next month, during a match with Owen Hart on ''Monday Night RAW'', Owen nailed Michaels with an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|Enzuigiri]] kick to the back of Michaels' head. They continued to wrestle, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion in the Syracuse incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1995.html|title=RAW 1995 Results|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> The concussion was a [[Work (professional wrestling)|work]], skillfully kept from most fans at the time.

====1996-1997====
After teasing a retirement, Michaels announced that he would be returning to the WWF at the ''[[Royal Rumble (1996)|1996 Royal Rumble]]'' match, which he won for the second year in a row.<ref name="Royal Rumble 1996">{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 95 | language = English}}</ref> Around this time, [[Jose Lothario]], Michaels' original trainer, became his on-screen manager.

Michaels won his first WWF Championship at ''[[WrestleMania XII]]'' in March 1996, pinning Bret Hart in the 'sudden death' overtime of their a sixty minute [[Iron Man match]], which had ended in a 0-0 tie.<ref name="WWE title">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454119|title=HBK's first WWE title reign|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Michaels' friends [[Scott Hall]] and [[Kevin Nash]], Michaels soldiered on as champion for most of the year, notably overcoming [[Mick Foley|Mankind]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/september/1996.htm|title=In Your House 10 Results|accessdate=2007-08-09|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> [[Leon White|Vader]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/august/1996.htm|title=SummerSlam 1996 Results|accessdate=2007-08-09|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/1996.htm|title=King of the Ring 1996 Results|accessdate=2007-08-09|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> in pay-per-view battles. 

At ''[[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam 1996]]'' in his main event WWF championship match with Vader, Michaels notoriously became agitated during the match when Vader misheard Michaels and did not move out of the way on his subsequent elbow drop. Michaels changed direction in mid air upon realizing Vader was not going to move and then shouts loudly "move!" whilst stamping legitimately on Vader's head. Michaels admitted in a later recorded shoot interview that Mankind suggested that during their match at ''[[In Your House#In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]]'', Michaels should re-enact his genuine heat with Vader and perform the same stamp sequence seen at SummerSlam a month earlier.

Michaels' title reign ended at the ''[[Survivor Series (1996)|1996 Survivor Series]]'' in November, where he lost to [[Sid Eudy|Sycho Sid]], his former bodyguard, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in a face vs. face match. This match was notable for the [[New York City|New York]] fans cheering for Sid when he hit both Michaels and Jose Lothario with a television camera and cheering again when he won the match and championship.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 96-97 | language = English}}</ref> A flu-ridden Michaels recaptured the belt from Sid in January at the ''[[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]]'' in front of his hometown fans in San Antonio.<ref name="2nd WWE title reign">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454115|title=HBK's second WWE title reign|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> 

Michaels was supposed to defend his title at a [[WrestleMania 13]] rematch with Bret Hart but he gave up the title on a special episode of ''RAW'' dubbed ''Thursday RAW Thursday'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forever-shawn.net/info/archives/trt.html|title=Forever Shawn >>> Transcripts|accessdate=2007-07-26|publisher=Forevershawn.net}}</ref> broadcast live on the [[USA Network]] on [[February 13]] [[1997]]. This speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania. Michaels had been told by doctors that a knee injury was bad enough to have to retire. In the speech, Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he "had to find his smile again", which he had "lost" somewhere down the line. In the end, Bret Hart resumed his feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] for [[WrestleMania 13]], and Michaels did color commentary at the event.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 98 | language = English}}</ref>

After knee surgery by [[James Andrews (physician)|Dr. James Andrews]], he returned a few months later, briefly teaming with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] to win the WWF Tag Team Titles.<ref name="Stone Cold & HBK">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132122112|title=Stone Cold & Shawn Michaels first World Tag Team title reign|accessdate=2007-07-12|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> However, after a real life backstage fight with Bret Hart, Michaels quit the WWF, until Vince McMahon convinced Michaels otherwise, and gave him the role of a heel.

At ''[[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam 1997]]'', Michaels officiated the WWF title match between WWF Champion [[The Undertaker]] and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels nailing Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after Bret spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the title to his nemesis, Bret Hart, setting the stage for their match at ''[[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 99-100 | language = English}}</ref> Michaels' striking of the Undertaker with a chair began a feud between the two men. In October, at ''[[WWE Bad Blood#1997|In Your House: Badd Blood]]'', Michaels and Undertaker participated in the very first [[Hell in a Cell]] match, which saw Michaels falling off the side of the 15-foot high structure through a table. Michaels won the match with the help of the Undertaker's brother [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]], who made his debut.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 99 | language = English}}</ref>

In the summer, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend, [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] and Hunter's then-girlfriend, [[Joanie Laurer|Chyna]] to form '''[[D-Generation X]]'''. The group engaged in rebellious behavior, such as using the [[D-Generation X]] slogan "Suck it!", in addition to the [[D-Generation X#Crotch chop|crotch chop]] towards other wrestlers, and sometimes fans. Moving away from the family-oriented product, this marked the beginning of the WWF Attitude Era. Michaels also began re-feuding with [[Bret Hart]]'s reformed [[The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]], which was now a pro-[[Canada]] [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|stable]]. Michaels taunted The Hart Foundation and Canada by engaging in acts, such as blowing his nose with and humping the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian Flag]]. In his book, ''[[Heartbreak and Triumph|Heartbreak & Triumph]]'', Michaels claims the flag desecration was Bret Hart's idea.

Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a title shot at the ''[[Survivor Series (1997)|1997 Survivor Series]]'' against Bret Hart in what is thought to be the most controversial match in wrestling history. Michaels came out of this match, dubbed by fans the "[[Montreal Screwjob]]", as the WWF World Champion.<ref name="3rd WWE title reign">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/30445415|title=HBK's third WWE title reign|accessdate=2007-07-13|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref>
Michaels thus became the only wrestler to hold both the World Championship and the European Championship at the same time. However, he had Triple H pin him in December in a [[farce|farcical]] match, making Hunter the European Champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1997.html|title=RAW 1997 Results|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

====1998-Injury====
In [[1998]], Michaels received a back injury in the [[List of professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Casket match]] against the Undertaker at the ''[[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/january/1998.htm|title=Royal Rumble 1998 Results|accessdate=2007-08-09|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>; Michaels took a back body drop to the outside and smashed his lower back on the casket, causing him to herniate two discs and crush one completely. This forced Michaels into retirement after losing the WWF Championship to [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] at ''[[WrestleMania XIV]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_3/ai_80302529|title=Breaking hearts, unbroken spirit; former superstar Shawn Michaels, "the HeartBreak Kid", had his sights set on becoming the WWF's "Comeback Kid" - wrestler - Cover Story - Interview|accessdate=2007-07-25|publication=Wrestling Digest}}</ref> Prior to losing the belt, Michaels, along with DX allies, made regular appearances much like Steve Austin did the previous year after injuring his neck at SummerSlam. Wrestlers such as [[Bret Hart]], as Michaels reveals in his autobiography, did interviews on live television claiming that Michaels was faking his whole injury. Bret later apologized for these events.

Michaels returned to the WWF on [[November 23]] [[1998]], but not as a wrestler; instead, he replaced [[Sgt. Slaughter]] as the [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling#Commissioners|WWF Commissioner]], joining Vince McMahon's [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|stable]] as a heel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1998.html|title=RAW 1998 Results|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular TV appearances, booking matches, stamping down his authority, and sometimes deciding the outcome of matches. In early 1999, Michaels turned face and re-joined D-Generation X, but disappeared from WWF television for a few months, and by the time he had returned DX had broken up.

Michaels made occasional appearances on WWF television as commissioner as a face during the spring and summer of 1999. He was supposed to turn heel once again during the premiere episode of [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|''SmackDown!'']] on [[August 26]] [[1999]] when, while serving as a special guest referee, he superkicked [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], allowing Triple H to retain the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/1999.html|title=SmackDown 1999 Results|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> However, Michaels did not appear on WWF television until [[May 21]] [[2000]], as a face, to officiate the [[Iron Man match]] between the Rock and [[Triple H]].<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 106 | language = English}}</ref> He made one last appearance a month later, when he handed over the role of commissioner to [[Mick Foley]], becoming the official spokesperson for the WWF. Michaels then disappeared from WWF television for nearly a year.

Michaels' prolonged absences were the result of his opening of the [[Texas Wrestling Academy|Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy]] in early 1999. In February 2001, Michaels signed a multi year contract extension with the WWF.

====2002-Return to ''RAW''====
In [[2002]], Michaels returned to wrestling, brought in by [[Kevin Nash]] as a new member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020603.html|title=RAW results - June 3, 2002|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> After the nWo was disbanded, Triple H apparently wanted to mend ties with Michaels. This was solidified when Michaels beseeched Triple H to return to ''RAW''. Later on, they came down to the ring with their [[D-Generation X]] music and attire. When they were about to do their trademark "Suck It" taunt, Triple H nailed Michaels with the [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020722.html|title=RAW results - July 22, 2002|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> A week later, Triple H attacked Michaels from behind in a parking lot and put his head through a car window.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020729.html|title=RAW - [[29 July]] [[2002]] Results|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> Michaels surprised everyone by challenging Triple H to "a fight" (a non-sanctioned match) at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]], which Triple H accepted. 

Michaels returned to the ring to wrestle a match against Triple H at SummerSlam 2002, laying the foundation for a feud that lasted for years. This match was noted for Michaels' emotional in-ring return after more than four years on the shelf. Michaels won at SummerSlam but was attacked with a sledgehammer by Triple H after the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/august/2002.htm|title=SummerSlam 2002 Results|accessdate=2007-08-08|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

At ''[[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series 2002]]'', Michaels won the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] from Triple H in the first-ever [[Elimination Chamber]] match, which also featured [[Rob Van Dam]], [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]], [[Chris Jericho]], and [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]]. Michaels eliminated both Jericho and Triple H to win the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/november/2002.htm|title=Survivor Series 2002 Results|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> This title win marked the first time in WWE history that a wrestler won a World Championship in any type of [[steel cage match]]. A month later, Michaels lost the World Championship to Triple H in a [[Two out of three falls match|Three Stages Of Hell match]] at ''[[WWE Armageddon#2002|Armageddon]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 112 | language = English}}</ref>

[[Image:Jerichomichaels.jpg|right|thumb|Michaels' match with Chris Jericho at WrestleMania XIX in March 2003 was his first match at a WrestleMania since his back surgery in 1998.]]
Michaels then proceeded to feud with [[Chris Jericho]]. On [[January 13]] [[2003]], Jericho won an over-the-top-rope challenge to select his entry number for the ''[[Royal Rumble]]'', choosing number two in order to start the match with Michaels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030113.html|title=RAW results - January 13, 2003|accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> who had already been named number one.

After the match, HBK offered his hand to Jericho who, instead of shaking it, hugged Michaels. At first it seemed like good sportsmanship by Chris Jericho but he quickly kicked Michaels in the groin.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/march/xix.htm|title=WrestleMania XIX Results|accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> 
 
At ''[[SummerSlam (2003)|SummerSlam 2003]]'' Michaels competed in the second-ever Elimination Chamber Match, which also featured [[Randy Orton]], Kevin Nash, Chris Jericho, [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], and eventual winner, World Heavyweight Champion, Triple H. During the match, he helped Chris Jericho eliminate Kevin Nash, which prompted Nash to attack both men before exiting the chamber. Later in the match, Michaels was eliminated by Goldberg.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 113-114 | language = English}}</ref> He then went on to feud with Evolution member Randy Orton, who defeated him at ''[[WWE Unforgiven#2003|Unforgiven]]''.<ref name="PS112">{{cite news | author = Martin, Finn | title = Power Slam Magazine, issue 112 | work = "Boldberg grabs gold" (Unforgiven 2003) | publisher = SW Publishing. | date = 2003-10-22 | pages = 22-23 | language = English}}</ref> Michaels then had short feuds with [[Mark Henry]] and the new World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg before joining Steve Austin's Survivor Series Team. At ''[[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]]'', Team Austin (Shawn Michaels, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, and [[Dudley Boyz|The Dudley Boyz]]) faced Team Bischoff ([[Scott Steiner]], Mark Henry, Chris Jericho, Christian, and Randy Orton). During the match, Evolution member [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] interfered and gave Michaels the Batista Bomb, costing him the match.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 114 | language = English}}</ref> Michaels went on to defeat Batista at ''[[WWE Armageddon#2003|Armageddon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/december/2003.htm|title=Armageddon 2003 Results|accessdate=2007-07-18|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

Michaels went on to be in the main event of ''[[WrestleMania XX]]'' as part of an ongoing feud with Triple H, where he came up short in a match against Triple H and [[Chris Benoit]] for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]].<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 115 | language = English}}</ref> At ''[[WWE Bad Blood#2004|Bad Blood]]'' in June, Michaels lost to Triple H in a [[Hell in a Cell]] match.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 115 | language = English}}</ref> The next night on RAW, [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]] attacked Michaels with a steel chair, injuring him ([[kayfabe]]) in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/040614.html|title=RAW results - June 14, 2004|accessdate=2007-07-18|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> Michaels made his return at ''[[WWE Unforgiven#2004|Unforgiven]]'' and defeated Kane in a No Disqualification Match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/september/2004.htm|title=Unforgiven 2004 Results|accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> Two months later, he lost a World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H (after Edge interfered) at ''[[WWE Cyber Sunday#2004|Taboo Tuesday 2004]]'' when the fans voted for him ahead of [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and [[Chris Benoit]] to face Triple H one more time.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 116 | language = English}}</ref> Following this, Michaels was out of action for a few months with a [[legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] torn [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]].

====2005-2006====
Michaels returned in January 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/041227.html|title=RAW results - December 27, 2004|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
as the special guest referee in the [[Elimination Chamber]] Match (which featured Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Edge, Randy Orton, Batista, and eventual winner Triple H) at ''[[WWE New Year's Revolution#2005|New Year's Revolution 2005]]''. During the match, Michaels superkicked Edge, starting a feud between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/january/2005raw.htm|title=New Years Revolution 2005 Results|accessdate=2007-08-09|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

At the ''[[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005 Royal Rumble]]'', Edge defeated Michaels, who pinned him using the ropes for leverage.<ref name=RR2005>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 117 | language = English}}</ref> Michaels went on to compete in the Rumble match later that night and eliminated [[Kurt Angle]]. An angry Angle returned to the ring and eliminated Michaels and then put Michaels in the Ankle Lock.<ref name=RR2005/> As a result of what happened at the Royal Rumble, Michaels issued a challenge to Angle for a match at [[WrestleMania 21]], which Kurt Angle accepted when he appeared on ''RAW'' to attack Michaels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050228.html|title=RAW results - February 28, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
The next Monday night on ''RAW'', Jannetty and Michaels had a one time reunion as The Rockers and defeated [[La Résistance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050314.html|title=RAW results - March 14, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
Three days later on ''SmackDown!'', Angle defeated Jannetty with the Ankle Lock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/050317.html|title=SmackDown results - March 17, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
To send a "message" to Michaels before WrestleMania, Angle also put HBK's former manager Sensational Sherri in the Ankle Lock on ''SmackDown!'' on [[March 24]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/050324.html|title=SmackDown results - March 24, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

The next night on ''RAW'', [[Mark Copani|Muhammad Hassan]] and [[Shawn Daivari|Daivari]] came out to confront and assault Michaels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050404.html|title=RAW results - April 4, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
The following week, Michaels approached ''RAW'' General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]] demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused but informed Michaels to find a partner and he would grant a match. Michaels then made a plea for [[Hulk Hogan]] to come back and team with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050411.html|title=RAW results - April 11, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
On the [[April 18]] [[2005]] episode of ''RAW'', Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared to save Michaels and accept his offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050418.html|title=RAW results - April 18, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
At ''[[WWE Backlash#2005|Backlash 2005]]'', Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels when Daivari was pinned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/april/2005.htm|title=Backlash 2005 Results|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

On the [[July 4]] [[2005]] edition of ''RAW'', Michaels and Hulk Hogan fought Kurt Angle and then-Intercontinental Champion [[Carly Colón|Carlito]] in a tag team match. During the post-match pose, Michaels hit Hogan with his Sweet Chin Music, knocking Hogan to the ground and turning Michaels heel for the first time since returning in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050704.html|title=RAW results - July 4, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
The following week on ''RAW'', HBK appeared on [[Piper's Pit]] where he superkicked [[Roddy Piper]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050711.html|title=RAW results - July 11, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
and then challenged Hulk Hogan to a match at ''[[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050718.html|title=RAW results - July 18, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
Prior to SummerSlam 2005, neither Hogan nor Michaels had lost in a one-on-one match at SummerSlam. Hogan defeated Michaels at SummerSlam. After the match Michaels extended his hand to him, saying "''I needed to know, and I found out''" and he and Hogan shook hands. Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd and Michaels turned face once more.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 118 | language = English}}</ref>

Michaels began a feud with [[Chris Mordetsky|Chris Masters]]. The pair faced each other in a match at ''[[WWE Unforgiven#2005|Unforgiven 2005]]'' where Michaels won via pinfall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/september/2005.htm|title=Unforgiven 2005 Results|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>
At ''[[WWE Cyber Sunday#2005|Taboo Tuesday 2005]]'', Michaels won the fans choice for the second year running and became a part of the [[List of professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] with [[John Cena]] and Kurt Angle. Cena would retain the [[WWE Championship]].<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 119 | language = English}}</ref>

On the [[December 26]] [[2005]] edition of ''RAW'', [[Vince McMahon]] lauded Michaels for his part in the [[Montreal Screwjob]]. Michaels said he was only being loyal to his company, but said he had moved on and McMahon should move on as well. McMahon told Michaels he can "screw" him like he screwed [[Bret Hart]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/051226.html|title=RAW results - December 26, 2005|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
and he began setting unusual stipulations for Michaels' matches and interfering on behalf of Michaels' opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060102.html|title=RAW results - January 2, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

During the ''[[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]]'', to which Michaels entered twenty fifth, he eliminated [[MNM]] and [[Shelton Benjamin]] in succession to make it into the final six. At that point, Mr. McMahon’s music hit, and the Chairman made his entrance. As HBK stared down McMahon, [[Shane McMahon]] made a surprising appearance, attacking Michaels from behind and eliminating him from the match. An irate HBK ran back into the ring and nailed [[Triple H]] with Sweet Chin Music before chasing the McMahons to the locker room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/january/2006.htm|title=Royal Rumble 2006 Results|accessdate=2007-08-09|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

After several weeks of attacks and stipulations, Michaels confronted McMahon in the ring and challenged him to a match. McMahon refused and attempted (unsuccessfully) to force Michaels to sign retirement papers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060213.html|title=RAW results - February 13, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
After Vince and Shane knocked HBK out with a steel chair,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060227.html|title=RAW results - February 27, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
Mr. McMahon booked a match between himself and HBK at [[WrestleMania 22]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060306.html|title=RAW results - March 6, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
During a handicap match against the [[Spirit Squad]] Michaels former partner [[Marty Jannetty]] came down to help Michaels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060220.html|title=RAW results - February 20, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
Mr. McMahon offered Jannetty a contract if he "kissed his ass." The next week on ''RAW'' Jannetty refused and took Chris Masters' "Masterlock challenge" instead. Michaels tried to help Jannetty, which ultimately ended in Shane forcing a groggy Michaels to kiss Vince's ass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060227.html|title=RAW results - February 27, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

Michaels and Shane McMahon then met in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Street Fight|Street Fight]] at ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event]]''. Throughout the match, Vince interfered, allowing Shane to get the upper hand. However, Michaels kept kicking out and refused to submit. When he got the upper hand again by superkicking Shane, Vince knocked the ref down before the three count. Michaels went after Vince, which gave Shane enough time to hit Michaels with a low blow from behind. Shane applied the Sharpshooter, and Vince McMahon immediately ordered for the bell to be rung, even though Michaels did not tap out; an allusion to the [[Montreal Screwjob]].<ref name="PS142">{{cite news | author = Power Slam Staff | title = Power Slam Magazine, issue 142 | work = "Looking at WWE: SNMW" (March 18, 2006) | publisher = SW Publishing. | date = 2006-04-20 | pages = 25 | language = English}}</ref>

Despite interference from the Spirit Squad and Shane McMahon, Michaels defeated Mr. McMahon at WrestleMania 22 in a bloody [[List of professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Holds Barred match]]. The match is noted for being the start of the DX reunion that was soon to come.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/march/22.htm|title=WrestleMania 22 Results|accessdate=2007-08-08|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>
At [[WWE Backlash#2006|Backlash 2006]], Vince and Shane McMahon beat Michaels (with "[[God]]" as his tag team partner) with help from the Spirit Squad in a no DQ match; Michaels suffered a partially broken nose.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 121 | language = English}}</ref>
Michaels got revenge on the Spirit Squad in various ways, but by [[May 22]] [[2006]] the Squad [[kayfabe|injured]] Michaels' knee; this angle was written so Michaels could have surgery on his knee, which had been legitimately injured for some time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060522.html|title=RAW results - May 22, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

=====Return of D-Generation X===== 
{{main|D-Generation X}}
[[Image:Dx-sig-pose.jpg|thumb|225px|left|DX showing off their signature poses]]
In [[2006]], a series of events took place which suggested a reunion of Shawn Michaels and Triple H as [[D-Generation X]] starting at ''[[WrestleMania 22]]'' where both Shawn Michaels and Triple H performed the crotch chop during their matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wrestlemania22.html|title=WrestleMania 22 Results|accessdate=2007-07-11 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>
The two continued to deliver chops in the following episodes of ''[[WWE Raw|WWE RAW]]'' as Michaels feuded with Vince McMahon and Triple H went for the [[WWE Championship]], repeatedly butting heads with Vince McMahon in the process.

On the [[June 12]] [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'', DX officially reunited. During Triple H's gauntlet match against the [[Spirit Squad]], Michaels came in to help Triple H, and the two did the DX "crotch chops."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060612.html|title=RAW results - June 12, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-11|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

After the win, the group continued its sophomoric antics at the expense of The Spirit Squad, [[Vince McMahon]], [[Shane McMahon]], and [[Jonathan Coachman]] for several weeks. They then defeated the Spirit Squad at ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' in a 5-2 elimination match<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/snme/060715.html|title=Saturday Night's Main Event - July 15, 2006 Results|accessdate=2007-07-11|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

At ''[[WWE Cyber Sunday#2006|Cyber Sunday]]'', DX took on [[Rated-RKO]] ([[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and [[Randy Orton]]). The fan-selected referee [[Eric Bischoff]] allowed the illegal use of a steel chair to give Rated RKO the ill-gotten win, and the plaudit of being the first tag team to defeat DX in a tag team match since their reformation in June 2006.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts | work = "Wrestling’s historical cards" | publisher = Kappa Publishing | date = 2007 | pages = 122 | language = English}}</ref> However, at ''[[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]]'', Team DX emerged victorious, in a clean sweep of Team Rated-RKO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/november/2006.htm|title=Survivor Series 2006 Results|accessdate=2007-08-08|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

On the [[January 29]], [[2007]] edition of ''RAW'', Michaels captured the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] for the fourth time from Rated-RKO alongside WWE Champion [[John Cena]].<ref name="Cena & HBK">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/4065380|title=John Cena & Shawn Michaels first World Tag Team title reign|accessdate=2007-07-12|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref>
He then won a Triple Threat Number One contender's match on another edition of ''RAW'' to earn a shot at the WWE Championship.<ref>{{cite news | author = PWI Staff | title = Pro Wrestling Illustrated, May 2007 | work = Arena Reports | publisher = Kappa Publishing | year = 2007 | month= May | | page = 130 | language = English}}</ref> On [[April 1]] at ''[[WrestleMania 23]]'', Cena defeated Michaels in the main event, with the [[WWE Championship]] on the line, after he was forced to submit to the STFU.<ref>{{cite web|first=Brett|last=Kaplan|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmtmh/is_200704/ai_n18774303|title=Cena, Kennedy, Taker big winners on big stage|accessdate=2007-07-26|date=April 2007|publisher=Miami Herald}}</ref> The next night on ''RAW'', Michaels and Cena competed in two back-to back 10 team [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]]s, winning the first against [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]], and lost the tag team titles in the 2nd battle royal when Michaels threw Cena over the top rope.

Michaels' feud with Cena continued and he faced off with Cena, [[Adam Copeland|Edge]], and [[Randy Orton]] in a Fatal Four Way match at ''[[WWE Backlash#2007|Backlash]]'' for the WWE Championship. Cena retained the title once again when Michaels hit the Sweet Chin Music on Cena causing him to fall on Orton, which gained him the pinfall.<ref>{{cite web|first=Brett|last=Kaplan|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmtmh/is_200705/ai_n19100378|title=HBK assists Cena in title defense|accessdate=2007-07-25|date=May 2007|publisher=Miami Herald}}</ref>

[[The Great Khali]] defeated Michaels in a no disqualification #1 contender's match when he was choke bombed through the announce table, causing the referee to end the match. Michaels then entered a feud with Randy Orton when Orton claimed that he could beat Michaels. Michaels then faced off against Orton at ''[[WWE Judgment Day#2007|Judgment Day]]''. The week before the match, Michaels was attacked by Orton twice after his match with Edge<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070514.html|title=RAW results - May 14, 2007|accessdate=2007-07-11 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> and backstage at Judgment Day, (which contributed to his injury from The Great Khali); Orton went onto defeat Michaels, when he collapsed during the match.

'''Entrance music'''
*The song ''Sexy Boy'' was originally written for Michaels by [[Jimmy Hart]]. Hart thanked Michaels personally for continuing to use the song as his entrance music when he was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2005. Michaels' entrance music was originally performed by [[Sherri Martel]] until she became a babyface, and then the second version was performed by Shawn Michaels himself with traces of Sherri in the chorus portion of the song. The current version of the song in use today is the version Michaels sung himself. Michaels says that the song was the product of "magic" because how it originally sounded right after recording was simply "brutal."
*Since the return of [[D-Generation X|DX]], Michaels mostly used the DX entrance ''Break It Down,'' by [[Chris Warren (musician)|The Chris Warren Band]], even when wrestling in singles competition, but then went back to using ''Sexy Boy''.

==Personal life==
Growing up, Michaels was never called "Michael" because he hated the name, so his family and friends just called him "Shawn". Ever since, he's been referred to as Shawn.<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.18)</ref>

In 1996, Michaels posed in a non-nude layout for [[Playgirl]] [[magazine]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.233)</ref>

Michaels' marriage to his first wife, Theresa, was brief and ended in divorce.<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.194)</ref> He is now married to former WCW [[Nitro Girls|Nitro Girl]], [[Rebecca Curci|Whisper (Rebecca Curci)]]. They were married on [[March 31]] [[1999]] at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.296)</ref> It was a very small wedding ceremony. The only people present were Michaels, Rebecca Curci, and an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] impersonator. Michaels and Curci have a son, Cameron Kade (born on [[January 5]] [[2000]])<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.304)</ref> and a daughter, Cheyenne Michelle (born on [[August 19]] [[2004]])<ref>Michaels, Shawn.Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.329)</ref>

Michaels has several tattoos. He has a tattoo of a heart with a sword through it with what appears to be a snake around it in the shape of an "S". He has one on his wedding finger, that has an ''R'' for his wife Rebecca. Another in his left wrist, it's a bracelet design that says: '''Cameron''' for his son. On his left leg he has a picture of his wife, the other leg has a picture of the state of Texas. Finally, he has a small broken heart with the letters "HBK" above it, tattooed on his right hip.

Michaels' return to the WWE at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam 2002]] was supposed to be a 'one night only' show; Jim Ross even informed the audience that "Michaels is gonna leave us with something to remember him by" and "this is a one night performance from Shawn Michaels". However, after discovering he could still perform 100% in the ring, he gradually went back into wrestling full-time.

Michaels is [[cross-dominance|ambidextrous]]. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write. He typically uses his right leg to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but sometimes uses his left leg for an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|enzuigiri kick]]. 

Michaels is a [[Born again Christianity|born again Christian]]. His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of Cornerstone Church in his hometown of San Antonio. He also appeared on a [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] program along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forever-shawn.net/pics/caps/tv/ptl0106/ptl0106.html|title=Forever Shawn >>> Transcripts|accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref>

He is a fan of the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He has been seen wearing Spurs merchandise and attending Spurs games. JBL made a reference to Michaels being a season ticket holder during the 2007 Royal Rumble Match.

Michaels is the cousin of former TNA talent [[Matt Bentley]].
