== Plot ==

Siddhu ([[Siddharth Narayan]]) is a well-disciplined young man - that's how his parents see him. Siddhu's father Aravind ([[Prakash Raj]]) makes every decision for him. From what he eats to whatever he wears. Siddhu accepts his father's choices merely to please him. However, Siddhu secretly decides to take control of choosing two things in his life, his  future spouse and his career. However, Siddhu soon becomes engaged to another girl ([[Neha Bamb]]).
While complaining to his friends about his impending marriage, he accidentally bumps head with a girl - Hasini ([[Genelia D'Souza]]) who does what she likes. He falls in love with her and when his father finds out about it, he is furious. However, Siddhu manages to convince his father to have Hasini to stay at their house for seven days - in order to befriend the family. Hasini stays and manages to win everyone over, save for the father. She leaves the house, saying she doesn't want to marry Siddhu anyway - she has realized that he is a completely different person at home and what he liked about her outside of his house, seems to be a problem inside. Siddhu complains that it is all his father's fault: that he missed so many things in life, because he was always forced to do everything his father's way - and now, he missed Hasini. His father relents and goes to Hasini's house to ask her to marry his son, while Siddhu cancels his engagement to the other girl. However, Hasini's father makes Siddhu stay at his house for seven days so Siddhu can prove his worth to him. The movie ends with the implication that Hasini's father accepts their relationship.
