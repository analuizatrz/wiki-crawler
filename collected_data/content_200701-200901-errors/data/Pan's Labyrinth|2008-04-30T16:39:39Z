'''''Pan's Labyrinth''''' ({{lang-es|El laberinto del fauno}}, literally ''The Labyrinth of the Faun'') is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Spanish films of 2006|Spanish]] [[Spanish language|language]] [[fantasy film]]<ref name="newtimes">{{cite news |last=Shafer|first=Craig |url=http://www.newtimesslo.com/index.php?p=showarticle&id=2232 | title=Amazing journey: Fantasy both frightening and beautiful lurks in this award-winning labyrinth | publisher=New Times SLO | date=[[2007-01-18]] | accessdate=2007-01-24 }}</ref><ref name="SF">{{cite news |url= http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html |title=Guillermo del Toro and Ivana Baquero escape from a civil war into the fairytale land of ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-01-27| date=[[2006-12-25]] |publisher=[[Science Fiction Weekly]]| last=Spelling|first=Ian}}</ref> written and directed by [[Mexico|Mexican]] film-maker [[Guillermo del Toro]]. It was produced and distributed by the Mexican film company [[Esperanto Films]].

''Pan's Labyrinth'' takes place in a dual setting: [[Spain]] in May and June, 1944, during the turbulent period shortly after the [[Spanish Civil War]], and a fantasy world experienced by a Spanish girl, Ofelia, who is given three tasks by a mysterious [[faun]]. In the "real world," Ofelia's stepfather, the [[Falange|Falangist]] Captain Vidal, viciously hunts the [[Spanish Maquis]], [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] who continue fighting the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime in the region, while her pregnant mother grows increasingly ill. The "fantasy world" is one that Ofelia enters through an overgrown [[labyrinth]] garden, where she meets all manner of strange and magical creatures who become central to her story. The film employs make-up, puppetry, and [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects to create its creatures.

Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a [[parable]], influenced by [[fairy tale]]s, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'',<ref name="SF"/> a [[spiritual sequel]], though not an actual sequel. The original Spanish title refers to the mythological fauns of [[Greek mythology]], while the [[English language|English]] title refers specifically to the faun-like [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] (intended to help English-speakers differentiate the title from the term [[fawn]]). However, Del Toro has stated that the faun in the film is not Pan.<ref name="SF"/> 

The film premiered at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[November 24]], [[2006]]. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the film was given a limited release on [[December 29]], [[2006]], with a nationwide release on [[January 19]], [[2007]].<ref name="bom">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=panslabyrinth.htm|title=Pan's Labyrinth (2006)|accessdate=2007-02-12  |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>  ''Pan's Labyrinth'' has won numerous international awards, including three [[Academy Awards]], the [[Ariel Award for Best Picture]], and the 2007 [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form|Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]].

==Plot==
<!-- Read this before editing: 1. This is a synopsis, try to keep it as short as possible. Tiny details do not need to be added to it. 2. The spoiler warning is not to be used on Wikipedia any longer. -->

The movie opens with a fairy tale.  Ofelia ([[Ivana Baquero]]), a young girl who loves to read, lies on the ground, bleeding, while the narration explains that Princess Moanna of the Underground Realm, curious about the world above, escapes to the Earth, where the sun blinds her and, forgetting her past, she weakens and dies.  Nonetheless, her father retains hope that her spirit will eventually return to him.  

The story then cuts to [[Spain under Franco|post-Civil War Spain]] in [[1944]], with [[Francisco Franco]] firmly in power. Ofelia has traveled with her pregnant mother Carmen ([[Ariadna Gil]]) to join Captain Vidal ([[Sergi López i Ayats]]), her new stepfather and father of Carmen's unborn child, at his post in the mountains where he is rooting out Marxist guerillas.

Ofelia discovers a [[stick insect]] that she believes to be a [[fairy]]. It follows her to the mill where Vidal is stationed. Ofelia chases it into an ancient labyrinth nearby. Ofelia meets Vidal's housekeeper, Mercedes ([[Maribel Verdú]]), who treats her kindly. Later that night, Ofelia overhears Mercedes and the local doctor conspiring to help the rebels. Upon her mother's request, Ofelia tells a story to her unborn brother, a fable about pain and loss, and the promise of eternal life.  After waking her in the middle of the night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom where it changes into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets the faun ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]), who says he believes her to be Princess Moanna. He gives her three tasks to complete before the [[full moon]] to ensure that her "[[essence]] is intact" so that she can return to her father's realm. 

[[Image:Panslabyrinthofelia.JPG|thumb|left|The faun gives Ofelia the ''Book of Crossroads'', which explains her tasks.]]

Ofelia completes the first task of retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad that lives deep beneath the roots of a fig tree. Ofelia is becoming more worried about her mother, who has been ordered to stay in bed as her condition has worsened. The faun tells Ofelia of a magic way to restore her mother to health. Meanwhile, her stepfather is proving to be a brutish, cruel man. Ofelia then undertakes the second task of retrieving an ornate dagger from the lair of the Pale Man (also played by [[Doug Jones (actor)|Jones]]), a gruesome, child-eating monster who sits motionless in front of a large feast.  Although she was gravely warned not to consume anything, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man, who attacks her fairy friends and pursues her. She narrowly escapes by drawing an escape door with a piece of chalk. However, infuriated at her disobedience for having eaten the grapes, the faun refuses to give her the third task.

Events in the real world take an even grimmer turn as Vidal captures and tortures a rebel. The doctor who has been staying with them to help Carmen is ordered to tend the wounds of the tortured rebel, so that he can be tortured some more. Instead, the doctor kills him to end his ordeal (at the rebel's request). Vidal kills the doctor, just as Carmen goes into labor and starts hemorrhaging. She dies in childbirth, but delivers a healthy son&mdash;Vidal had said that if only one could be saved, that it should be his son. Vidal discovers that Mercedes is a spy, and he captures her and Ofelia as they attempt to escape. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, and Mercedes is taken to be tortured; however, she frees herself using a hidden knife with which she stabs and [[Glasgow smile|slices]] Vidal, but not fatally. She then flees but is caught. At the last moment, the rebels show up and rescue her.

The faun returns to Ofelia and gives her one more chance to prove herself. He tells her to take her baby brother into the labyrinth. She then uses the magic chalk to escape her room and sneak into Vidal's room. She drugs Vidal and grabs her brother; although disoriented, Vidal chases her through the labyrinth while the rebels attack the mill and Mercedes searches for her. The faun tells Ofelia that the [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] to the underworld will open only with the blood of an innocent, so he needs a drop of her brother's blood. Ofelia refuses to allow her brother to be harmed, so the faun, furious, disappears. Vidal finds her, takes the baby and shoots Ofelia. She falls to the ground, bleeding.  

When Vidal leaves the labyrinth, the rebels and Mercedes are waiting for him. Realizing that he will die, he calmly hands Mercedes the baby, and starts to make a request that they tell his son about his heroic father, but Mercedes tells him that his son will never even know his name. Pedro, one of the rebels, shoots Vidal in the face, killing him.

Mercedes enters the labyrinth to find Ofelia dying, while Ofelia's blood drips onto the altar that was the gateway into the underworld. The scene flashes to a dream-like state: Ofelia is reunited with the king ([[Federico Luppi]]) (her deceased father, resurrected) and queen (her mother, alive again) of the underworld. The faun is there, as are the fairies. Ofelia learns that by sacrificing herself, instead of her brother, she succeeded at the final task, proving herself to be the Princess Moanna and achieving immortality. In the real world, Ofelia dies. The viewer is left wondering which is the reality;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/carrie_rickey/20070112_inq_weekend_CRKPAN.html |author=Carrie Rickey |title=A magical tale of fantasy as an escape from evil |publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer |date=Fri, Jan. 12, 2007}}</ref> it is unclear from the inter-cut scenes whether she has actually died, as it seems in the world on the surface, or if she has taken her place as the princess of the underworld.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/movies/29laby.html?_r=1&ex=1168491600&en=a4a7b437ab5e3751&ei=5070&oref=slogin |author=A.O.

===Influences===
The idea for ''Pan's Labyrinth'' came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, which he says are filled with "doodles, ideas, drawings, and plot bits." He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.premiere.com/features/3364/del-toros-pans-labyrinth-sketches.html |accessdate=2007-07-20|date=|title=Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth Sketches| publisher=Premiere.com}}</ref> At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.mrnewsmx.com/fullStory.php?nid=25996 |accessdate=2007-07-20|date=[[2006-11-06]]|title=Almost a horror story|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Horn|first=John}}</ref> Though he originally wrote a story about a pregnant woman who falls in love with a faun,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=film&article=288 |accessdate=2007-07-20 |title=The world of the labyrinth|publisher=Bay Area Reporter|date=[[2007-01-04]]| last=Lamble|first=David}}</ref> Sergi López said that Del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written.'" López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he's said that "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head." <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.canmag.com/nw/6255-sergi-lopez-pans-labyrinth-interview |title=Sergi Lopez on ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-02]]|publisher=CanMag| last=Topel |first=Fred}}</ref>

Del Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "Alice" books, [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[Ficciones]]'', [[Arthur Machen]]'s ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' and ''[[The White People]]'', [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany's]] ''The Blessing of Pan'', [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s ''Pan's Garden'' and [[Francisco Goya]]'s works. In 2004, del Toro said: "Pan is an original story. Some of my favourite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling (remember the labyrinth image on ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]''?) and I am trying to mix them and play with them."<ref> [http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=28#28 Del Toro message board, Answers Archive Wed Nov 24, 2004 1:27 am], repost from elsewhere; Retrieved on [[2007-08-20]].</ref> It was also influenced by the illustrations of [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref name="panspeople">{{cite news|url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1949245,00.html |title=Pan's people|date=[[2006-11-17]]|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref> 

There are differing ideas about the film's religious influences. Del Toro himself has said that he considers ''Pan's Labyrinth'' "a truly profane film, a layman's riff on Catholic dogma", but that his friend [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]] described it as "a truly Catholic film". Del Toro's explanation is "once a Catholic, always a Catholic".<ref name="panspeople"/>

[[Guillermo Navarro]], the director of photography, said that "after doing work in Hollywood on other movies and with other directors, working in our original language in different scenery brings me back to the original reasons I wanted to make movies, which is basically to tell stories with complete freedom and to let the visuals really contribute to the telling of the story."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/January2007/PansLabyrinth/page1.php |title=Fear and Fantasy|accessdate=2007-06-17|date=January 2007|publisher=[[American Cinematographer]]}}</ref>

===Casting===
*'''[[Ivana Baquero]]''' as '''Ofelia''': Del Toro says he was "scared shitless" in casting the right actress for the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June to October 2005, when she was 11.) "The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age."<ref name="DH">{{cite news |url= http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php |title=Exclusive Interview: Guillermo del Toro "Pan's Labyrinth" |accessdate=2007-01-28|date=[[2006-09-26]] |publisher=Dark Horizons |last=Fischer|first=Paul}}</ref> Baquero says that del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairytales to help her "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was "marvelous", and that "At the same time it can bring you pain and sadness and scariness and happiness."<ref name=SF/>
*'''[[Sergi López i Ayats]]''' as '''Captain Vidal''': Del Toro met with López in [[Barcelona]], a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told Del Toro "You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care."<ref name="oscarwatch">{{cite news |url=http://www.oscarwatch.com/2007/01/pans_labyrinth_a_story_that.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth: A Story that Needed Guillermo Del Toro |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-11]]|publisher=oscarwatch.com| last=Stone|first=Sasha}}</ref> Of his character, López said he is "the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence &mdash; and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder &mdash; that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism."<ref name="Lopez biography">{{cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0530365/bio|title=Sergi López's biography|accessdate=2007-07-25 |date=[[2007-07-25]]|publisher=oscarwatch.com| last=Stone|first=Sasha}}</ref> 
*'''[[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]''' as '''The Faun''' and '''The Pale Man''': Jones had worked with del Toro before on ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' and ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'', and says the director sent him an email saying, "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you." Jones read an English translation of the script and was enthusiastic but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was "terrified" and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, or dubbing his lines with a [[voice-over]] actor, but Jones rejected both ideas preferring to learn the words himself. He said, "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right before I even went in," using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/6216|title=Doug Jones En Espanol |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2006-12-27]] |publisher=CanMag |last=Topel |first=Fred}}</ref> Del Toro decided afterwards that he still preferred to dub Jones with the voice of "an authoritative theatre actor," but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to easily match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.straight.com/node/63731 |title=Labyrinth’s faun unmasked |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=[[2007-01-11]] |publisher=straight.com |last=Eisner |first=Ken}}</ref>
*'''[[Maribel Verdú]]''' as '''Mercedes''': Like López, Verdú was cast against type; usually playing a sex goddess, del Toro selected her to play the compassionate revolutionary because he "saw a sadness in her ... he thought would be perfect for the part".<ref name="oscarwatch"/>
*'''[[Ariadna Gil]]''' as '''Carmen''': Ofelia's mother and Vidal's wife.
*'''Alex Angulo''' as '''Doctor Ferreiro''': a doctor in the service of Vidal who is anti-fascist.
*'''Manolo Solo''' as '''Garces''': one of Vidal's lieutenants.
*'''César Vea''' as '''Serrano''': one of Vidal's lieutenants.
*'''Roger Casamajor''' as '''Pedro''': Mercedes' brother, who is one of the rebels.

===Effects===
''Pan's Labyrinth'' employs some computer generated imagery in its effects, but also uses complex make-up and [[puppetry]]. The giant toad was inspired by ''[[The Maze (1953 film)|The Maze]]''. Del Toro himself performed the noises. The mandrake root is a combination of puppetry and CGI. Del Toro wanted the fairies "to look like little monkeys, like dirty fairies," but the animation company had the idea to give them wings made of leaves.<ref name="USAToday">{{cite web|url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-01-02-pans-labyrinth-main_x.htm |accessdate=2007-07-20|date=2007-03-14|title=Surprises lurk inside ''Pan's Labyrinth''| publisher=[[USA Today]]|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan}}</ref>

Jones spent five hours putting on make-up for the faun, which was mostly [[latex]] foam. He operated the faun's legs, while his own were digitally erased. Puppeteers helped to operate his face. Del Toro told Jones to "go rock star... like a glam rocker. But less David Bowie, more Mick Jagger."<ref name="USAToday"/> Del Toro also had the faun grow younger as the movie progressed. Jones said that he had to look out of the Pale Man's nostrils. The Pale Man's legs were attached to the front of his over a green leotard.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.chud.com/index.php?type=interviews&id=8772 |accessdate=2007-07-20|title=INTERVIEW: DOUG JONES (PAN'S LABYRINTH)|date=[[2007-02-18]]|last=Fischer|first=Russ}}</ref>

===Subtitles===
The film uses subtitles for its translation into other languages, including English. Del Toro wrote them himself, because he was disappointed with the subtitles of his previous Spanish film, ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]''. In an interview, he said that they were "for the thinking impaired" and "incredibly bad." He spent a month working with two other people, and said that he didn't want it to "feel like... watching a subtitled film."<ref>"[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/labyrinth%20director%20wrote%20his%20own%20subtitles_1021894 Guillermo Del Toro - Labyrinth Director Wrote His Own Subtitles]", contactmusic.com, [[2007-02-13]].

=== Comparisons to other films ===
In 2007, del Toro noted the striking similarities between his film and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney's]] ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'': both films are set around the same time, have similar child-age principal characters, mythic creatures (particularly the fauns), and themes of "disobedience and choice." Says del Toro: "This is my version of that universe, not only 'Narnia,' but that universe of children's literature."<ref name=del-toro-narnia>{{cite news|url=http://www.starbeacon.com/heat/local_story_363121523|title=Del Toro crafts a harrowing fairy tale|accessdate=2007-03-28|date=[[2006-12-29]] |publisher=[[Star Beacon]]}}</ref> In fact, del Toro was asked to direct ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' but turned it down for ''Pan's Labyrinth.''<ref name=del-toro-narnia/>

In addition to ''Narnia'', ''Pan's Labyrinth'' has also been compared to films such as [[Gabor Csupo]]'s ''[[Bridge to Terabithia (2007 film)|Bridge to Terabithia]]'' and [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/83674.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth Film Review - Time Out Film |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6778-bridge-terabithia-review | title=Bridge to Terabithia a Pan's Labyrinth for Kids |accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> Del Toro himself has noted similarities with ''[[The Spirit of the Beehive]]''.<ref name=outsidetheframe>{{cite web|url= http://www.thephoenix.com/OutsideTheFrame/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8ae649e6-a17f-478b-993a-a6f0f791a936 |title=Outside The Frame: Guillermo Del Toro Interview Part 1 |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=[[2007-01-11]] |publisher=ThePhoenix.com}}</ref>
