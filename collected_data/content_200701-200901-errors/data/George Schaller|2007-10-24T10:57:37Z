'''Dr. George Beals Schaller''' (born [[1933]]) is a [[mammalogist]], [[natural history|naturalist]], [[conservationist]] and [[author]]. Schaller is recognized by many as the world's preeminent field [[biologist]], studying [[wildlife]] throughout [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]].<ref name="msu" /><ref name="time">{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1663317_1663323_1669908,00.html|title=George Schaller - Heroes of the Environment|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 19|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|year=2007|author=Bryan Walsh|language=English}}</ref><ref name="man">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2006/10/01/stories/2006100100120500.htm|title= Man of Nature: A freewheeling chat with environmentalist George Schaller.|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 5|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|year=2006|author=K.

==Early life==

Schaller received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from the [[University of Alaska]] in [[1955]], and went on to the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] to obtain his [[Ph.D.]] in [[1962]].<ref name="cas" /><ref name="interview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryasia.com/interviews/gbschaller.php|title=Dr. George Schaller Interview|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 19|publisher=Sanctuary Asia|year=2006|author=Sanctuary Asia|language=English}}</ref> From 1962 to [[1963]], he was a fellow at the Behavioral Sciences department of [[Stanford University]]. From 1963 to [[1966]], Schaller served as research associate for the [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Pathology|Pathobiology]] department, and from 1966 to [[1972]], served as the [[Rockefeller University]]'s and [[New York Zoological Society]]'s research associate in research and animal behavior.<ref name="icp">{{Cite web|url=http://www.expo-cosmos.or.jp/jusyou/1996_e.html|title=The Prizewinner, 1996: George Beals Schaller|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 5|publisher=International Cosmos Prize|year=1996|author=International Cosmos Prize|language=English}}</ref> He later served as Director of the New York Zoological Society's International Conservation Program from [[1979]] to [[1988]].<ref name="natgeo2" />

==Mountain gorilla research== 

In [[1959]], when Schaller was only 26, he traveled to Central [[Africa]] to study and live with the [[gorilla|mountain gorilla]]s (''Gorilla beringei beringei'') of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]].<ref name="time" /><ref name="Natgeo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/best-of-adventure-2007/wildlife/george-schaller-leopards-lions-pandas.html|title=Biologist George Schaller's 50-Year Battle|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 5|publisher=National Geographic|year=2007|author=Ryan Bradley|language=English}}</ref><ref name="cic">{{Cite web|url=http://school.discoveryeducation.com/ontv/championsofthewild_1006.html|title=Mountain Gorillas|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 5|publisher=[http://www.ciconline.org/home Cable in the Classroom]|year=2006|author=Cable in the Classroom|language=English}}</ref> Little was known about the life of gorillas in the wild until the publication of ''The Mountain Gorilla: Ecology and Behavior'' in [[1963]], that first conveyed to the general public just how profoundly intelligent and gentle gorillas really are, contrary to then-common beliefs. Schaller has more recently recounted his epic two year study in ''The Year of the Gorilla'', which also provides a broader historical perspective on the efforts to save one of humankind's nearest relatives from the brink of extinction.<ref name="Natgeo" />

The American zoologist, [[Dian Fossey]], with assistance from the [[National Geographic]] society and [[Louis Leakey]], followed Schaller's ground-breaking field research on mountain gorillas in the Virungas.<ref name="lang" /> Schaller and Fossey were instrumental in dispelling the public perception of gorillas as brutes, by demonstrably establishing the deep compassion and social intelligence evident among gorillas, and how very closely their behavior parallels that of humans.<ref name="interview" />

==Conservation career==

In 1966, Schaller and  his wife traveled to [[Tanzania]] to live in the [[Serengeti]], and Schaller conducted one of the first studies of social behavior and movement of Africa's big cats.<ref name="uofa" /><ref name="Natgeo" /> 

In his 1972 work ''The Tree Where Man Was Born'', author [[Peter Matthiessen]] described Schaller as "single-minded, not easy to know". Matthiessen went on to say Schaller was "a stern pragmatist" who "takes a hard-eyed look at almost everything", "lean and intent", and in 1978's ''The Snow Leopard'' Matthiessen wrote that by that time, some considered Schaller the world's finest field biologist.<ref name="msu" /><ref name="man" /><ref name="matt">{{cite book |author=Matthiessen, Peter |title=The Snow Leopard (Penguin Nature Classics) |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=1978 |pages=352 pages |isbn=0-14-025508-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref>

In the fall of [[1973]], Schaller went to the remote [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region, {{mi to km|250}} inside [[Dolpo]], an area of [[Nepal]] occupied by people of the [[Tibet]]an culture and ethnicity.<ref name="interview" /> Schaller was there to study the Himalayan [[Bharal]], (blue sheep), and possibly glimpse the elusive [[snow leopard]], an animal rarely ever spotted in the wild. Schaller is one of only two Westerners known to have seen a snow leopard in Nepal between [[1950]] and 1978. Accompanying him on the trip was Matthiessen, and as a result of the trip, Matthiessen wrote ''The Snow Leopard'', ([[1978]]) detailing the accounts of their travels and research, which won the [[National Book Award]]. Schaller is referred to throughout the book as "GS".<ref name="matt" /><ref name="matthiessen">{{cite book |author=Matthiessen, Peter |title=The Snow Leopard |publisher=Viking Press |location=New York |year=1978 |pages=338 pages |isbn=0-670-65374-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

In the late [[1970s]], Schaller spent time in Brazil studying the [[jaguar]], [[capybara]], [[alligator]], and other animals of the region.<ref name="icp" /> 

In [[1988]], Schaller and his wife traveled to [[China]]'s [[Tibetan Plateau|Chang Tang]] (Qian Tang) region to study the [[Giant Panda]], and became the first westerners permitted to enter the remote region.<ref name="book">{{cite book |author=Schaller, George B. |title=Tibet's Hidden Wilderness: Wildlife and Nomads of the Chang Tang Reserve |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=168 pages |isbn=0-8109-3893-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref> Schaller sought to refute the notion that the panda population was declining due to natural [[bamboo]] die-offs.<ref name="interview" /><ref name="icp" /> Instead, Schaller found the panda's popularity was leading to its frequent capture, and was the biggest threat to the population. Schaller also found evidence that pandas were originally [[carnivore]]s, but underwent an evolutionary change to accommodate a diet of [[bamboo]], which is difficult to digest, reducing competition with other animals for food.<ref name="icp" />  Since Schaller's research, the panda population has increased in the wild by 45 percent.<ref name="Natgeo" /> During his time in China, Schaller would hand out cards to wildlife hunters that read: "All beings tremble at punishment, to all, life is dear. Comparing others to oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill."<ref name="Natgeo" /> Schaller has spent more time in China, than he has spent at his home in Connecticut.<ref name="lang" />

In [[1994]], Schaller and Dr. [[Alan Rabinowitz]] were the first scientists to uncover the rare [[Saola]], a [[forest]]-dwelling [[bovine]] in [[Laos]]. Later that year, Schaller rediscovered the Vietnamese [[Indo-chinese Warty Pig|Warty pig]], once thought extinct. In [[1996]], he located a herd of [[Tibetan red deer]], also thought extinct.<ref name="lang" /><ref name="Natgeo" /> 

In [[2003]], Schaller returned to Chang Tang, and found the wildlife in the area had rebounded since his first trip to the region.<ref name="wcs" /><ref name="china">{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/mgryzdzg/t36537.htm|title= American Biologist Praises Tibetan Wildlife Conservation|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 19|publisher=Chinese [[Embassy]]|year=2003|author=Chinese Embassy|language=English}}</ref><ref name="npr">{{Cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7316356|title=A Resurgence of Wildlife in Northern Tibet|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 19|publisher=National Public Radio|year=2007|author=Alex Chadwick|language=English}}</ref> Most significantly, the wild [[yak]] population, which was estimated at only 13 individuals, had grown to over 187.<ref name="china" /> "The Tibet Forestry Department has obviously made a dedicated and successful effort in protecting the wildlife." Schaller wrote in a letter to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]]'s Dawa Cering.<ref name="china" /> While in Tibet, Schaller worked on researching the rare Tibetan [[antelope]], or chiru, whose population declined due to trophy hunting for their exotic wool.<ref name="lcaof">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcaof.org/new.html|title=Current Reports: Observations from a Recent Field Report|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 20|publisher=Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation|author=George B.

In 2007, Schaller worked with [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and China to develop a new "Peace Park", that would protect {{mi2 to km2|20000}} of habitat for the largest wild sheep species, the [[Marco Polo sheep]].<ref name="lang" /><ref name="hindutwo" /><ref name="Natgeo" /> In danger due to their impressive spiral horns, which can measure up to {{ft to m|6}} in length, the sheep is sought out as a trophy by international hunters.<ref name="lang" /> Schaller's research in the [[Pamir Mountains]] will play an important role in the park's creation.<ref name="lang" /><ref name="time" /><ref name="hindutwo" />

==Conservation results==

Schaller's work in conservation has resulted in the protection of large stretches of area in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]], [[Brazil]], the [[Hindu Kush]] in Pakistan, and forests in Southeast [[Asia]].<ref name="newsci">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12617184.500.html|title=On the Trail of the Snow Leopard|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 19|publisher=[[New Scientist]] - Reed Business Information Ltd|year=1990|author=Christopher Joyce|language=English}}</ref> Due to Schaller's work, over 20 parks or preserves worldwide have been established, including [[Alaska]]'s [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR), the Shey-Phoksundo National Park in Nepal, and the Chang Tang Nature Reserve, one of the world's most significant wildlife refuges.<ref name="lang" /><ref name="man" /><ref name="interview" /><ref name="wcs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wcs.org/353624/192525|title=WCS Biologist George Schaller Reports Surprising Increase of Wildlife in Tibet|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 19|publisher=Wildlife Conservation Society|year=2007|author=Wildlife Conservation Society|language=English}}</ref> At over {{mi2 to km2|200000}},<ref name="npr" /> the Chang Tang Nature Reserve is triple the size of [[United States|America]]'s largest wildlife refuge, and was called "One of the most ambitious attempts to arrest the shrinkage of natural ecosystems," by ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name="cas">{{Cite web|url=http://www.calacademy.org/geninfo/newsroom/releases/2000/schaller0100.html|title=A Conversation with Dr. George Schaller|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 5|publisher=[[California Academy of Sciences]]|year=2000|author=[[California Academy of Sciences]]|language=English}}</ref>

==Controversy==

Schaller is one of a few prominent scientists who argue that [[bigfoot]] reports are worthy of further study. A 2003 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' story described Schaller as a "Bigfoot [[skeptic]]", but also said it was his opinion that scientists didn't bother with researching the subject before they "write it off as a [[hoax]] or [[mythology|myth]].

==Publications ==

Schaller has written more than fifteen books on African and Asian [[mammal]]s, including ''Serengeti Lion: A Study of [[Predator]]–[[Prey]] Relations'', ''The Last Panda'', and ''Tibet's Hidden Wilderness'', based on his own studies, and supported by long-term observations of species in their natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s. Schaller has also written hundreds of magazine articles, and dozens of books and scientific articles about [[tiger]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[cheetah]]s and [[leopard]]s, as well as wild sheep and goats, [[rhinoceros|rhinoceri]], and [[flamingo]]s. Over more than five decades, Schaller's field research has helped shape wildlife protection efforts around the world.<ref name="lang" /><ref name="man" /><ref name="cas" /><ref name="Natgeo" />
