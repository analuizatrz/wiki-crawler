About 363 million years ago amphibians came into existence.

When this argument was formulated, biologists divided all life into [[procaryote]]s, which are all single-celled, and [[eucaryote]]s, cells that are much larger and more complex and which appear both as single cells and in [[multicellular]] organisms. In the 1970s it was proposed and, after much debate, accepted that eucaryotes emerged as a result of a sequence of [[endosymbiosis | endosymbioses]] between procaryotes. For example: a predatory micro-organism invaded a large procaryote but the attack was neutralized, and the attacker took up residence and evolved into the first of the [[mitochondria]], [[organelle]]s that act as a eucaryote cell's principal energy suppliers; one of these [[Chimera (genetics) | chimera]]s later tried to swallow a [[photosynthesis |photosynthesizing]] procaryotic [[cyanobacterium]], but the victim survived inside the attacker and the new combination became the ancestor of [[plant]]s; and so on.<ref>{{cite book

However other research that started in the 1970s led to the recognition that there are now [[Three-domain system | three domains]] or major types of cell, eucaryotes, bacteria and [[archaea]]; and the term "procaryote" is now [[deprecated]].<ref name="Pace2008MolecularTreeOfLife">{{cite journal

Working out the shape of the "family tree" of eucaryotes, bacteria and archaea has also been hindered by the fact that most bacteria and archaea cannot be cultivated in laboratories. Most analyses have therefore relied on [[molecular phylogenetics]], classifying eucaryotes, bacteria and archaea by their proteins and forms of RNA used for various functions, rather than by direct observation. A widely-supported tree shows archaea and eucaryotes as "sisters", with bacteria as their "aunt".<ref name="Pace2008MolecularTreeOfLife" /> On the other hand a very different hypothesis shows eucaryotes as the earliest of the the three domains, with archaea and bacteria among their descendants; it reasons that eucaryotes retain many primitive-looking RNA functions, which archaea and bacteria discarded as they colonized hotter environments in which RNA is often unstable.<ref name="PooleJeffaresPenny1999EucaryotesEarly">{{cite journal

The differences between archaea, bacteria and eucaryotes are much greater than those within any of the three domains. This implies that there was much more radical change in the relatively short time between the LUCA and the first members of each of these domains than in the billions of years from the appearance of the domains to the present. Hence the LUCA's genetic replication system must have been significantly less accurate than those of modern cells.

Even the simple LUCA described above was too complex to have been the first type of life, since a replication system based on DNA requires a complex array of RNA and protein molecules as well. The discovery that some RNA molecules can [[catalyst | catalyze]] both their own replication and the construction of proteins led to the hypothesis of earlier life-forms based entirely on RNA. These [[ribozymes]] would have formed an [[RNA world]] in which there were individuals but no species, as [[mutation]]s and horizontal gene transfers would have meant that the offpsring in each generation were quite likely to have different genomes from those that their parents started with. At this stage it is quite likely that there was direct competion between ribozymes unaided by proteins, membranes and all the other apparatus of modern cells.<ref name="Hoenigsberg2003SelectionWithoutSpeciation" /> The earliest "ribozymes" may have been formed of simpler [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[PNA]],  [[TNA]] or GNA.<ref>{{cite journal

However, if the "RNA world" hypothesis is true, even the simplest ribozymes appear so complex that it is hard to see how they survived unaided through the early stages of their evolution, when their total lack of  self-repair capabilities would have made them very fragile. This led to a search for [[crystal]]line inorganic [[substrate]]s, surfaces that were less fragile but self-replicating and capable of attracting and bonding with growing RNA molecules. Various [[clay]]s and forms of [[iron sulfide]] have been proposed as substrates. Eventually some RNA molecules would have detached from their substrates and those that flourished would have started the "RNA world" phase of evolution.

This transition from non-living to living replicators implies that natural selection would have been operating before the actual emergence of life.<ref>{{cite journal

Somehow, in the energetic chemistry of early Earth, a molecule (or even something else) gained the ability to make copies of itself&mdash;the replicator. The nature of this molecule is unknown, its function having long since been superseded by life’s current replicator, [[DNA]]. In making copies of itself, the replicator did not always perform accurately; some copies contained an error. If the change destroyed the copying ability of the molecule, there could be no more copies, and the line would die out. On the other hand, a few rare changes might make the molecule replicate faster or better; those strains would become more numerous and successful. As choice raw materials (food) became depleted, strains which could exploit different materials, or perhaps halt the progress of other strains and steal their resources, became more numerous.<ref name="Dawkins-Ancestors-563">{{cite book

== Life before Cambrian ==
{{Main|Precambrian}}
The '''Precambrian''' extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] Period (about 570 [[annum|Ma]]).  It is not known when life originated, but carbon in 3.8 billion year old rocks from islands of western [[Greenland]] may be of organic origin.  Well-preserved bacteria older than 3.46 billion years have been found in [[Western Australia]].  Probable fossils 100 million years older have been found in the same area.  There is a fairly solid record of bacterial life throughout the remainder of the Precambrian.<ref name=prelifefm>{{cite web

The earliest cells had to form and exist in anoxic conditions. They were probably chemosynthetic.<ref>Gore, Pamela J.W. ([[February 3]] [[1999]]).

These are referred to as ''[[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran or Vendian biota]]''. Hard-shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that timespan.

A very diverse collection of animal forms appeared around {{Ma|544|Ma}}, starting in the latest Precambrian with a poorly understood ''[[small shelly fauna]]'' and ending in the very early Cambrian with a very diverse, and quite modern ''[[Burgess shale|Burgess fauna]]'', the rapid radiation of forms called the ''[[Cambrian explosion]]'' of life.

== Life during Phanerozoic ==
===Paleozoic life===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
[[Image:Asaphiscuswheelerii.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Trilobites]] flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era until becoming extinct in the [[Permian]] period]]
The Paleozoic spanned from roughly 542 [[mya (unit)|mya]] to roughly 251 mya ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004).
The Paleozoic covers the time from the first appearance of abundant, hard-shelled animal [[fossil]]s to the time when the [[continent]]s were beginning to be dominated by large, relatively sophisticated reptiles and complex [[fern]]s and [[seed plant]]s. The lower (oldest) boundary was classically set at the first appearance of creatures known as [[trilobite]]s and [[archeocyathid]]s. The upper (youngest) boundary is set at a major [[extinction event]] 300 million years later, known as the [[Permian extinction]]. Modern practice sets the older boundary at the first appearance of a distinctive [[trace fossil]] called ''[[Trichophycus pedum]]''.

At the start of the era, animal life was confined to [[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran fauna]].
There is some evidence that simple life may already have invaded the land at the start of the Paleozoic, but substantial plants did not take to the land until the [[Ordovician]], followed by animals in the Silurian. Neither group thrived on land until the Devonian. Although primitive [[vertebrate]]s are known near the start of the Paleozoic, animal forms were dominated by [[invertebrate]]s until the mid-Paleozoic. [[Fish]] populations exploded in the Devonian. During the late Paleozoic, great [[forest]]s of primitive plants thrived on land forming the great [[coal]] beds of [[Europe]] and eastern [[North America]]. By the end of the era, the first large, sophisticated reptiles and the first modern plants ([[conifer]]s) had developed.<ref>Rieboldt, S. (November 2002).

===Mesozoic life===
{{Main|Mesozoic}}
The Mesozoic extended roughly from 251 [[Mya (unit)|Ma]] to 65 Ma ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004).
The extinction of nearly all animal species at the end of the [[Permian]] period allowed for the [[adaptive radiation|radiation]] of many new lifeforms.  In particular, the extinction of the large [[herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dinocephalia]] left those [[ecological niche]]s empty. Some were filled by the surviving [[cynodont]]s and [[dicynodont]]s, the latter of which subsequently became extinct. [[Animal]] life during the Mesozoic was dominated, however, by large [[archosaur]]ian [[reptile]]s that appeared a few million years after the Permian extinction: [[dinosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and aquatic reptiles such as [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, and [[mosasaur]]s.<ref>"[http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Paleobiology/Mesozoic_Paleobiology.htm Mesozoic Era Paleobiology]". ''Fossil Museum''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-07]].</ref>

The climatic changes of the late Jurassic and Cretaceous provided for further adaptive radiation. The Jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity, and the first [[bird]]s and [[Eutheria|placental mammal]]s also appeared. [[Flowering plant|Angiosperms]] radiated sometime in the early Cretaceous, first in the [[tropics]], but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period. By the end of the Cretaceous, angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas, although some evidence suggests that [[biomass]] was still dominated by [[cycad]] and [[fern]]s until after the KT extinction.

Some have argued that [[insect]]s diversified with angiosperms because insect [[anatomy]], especially the [[mouth]] parts, seems particularly well-suited for flowering plants. However, all major insect mouth parts preceded angiosperms and insect diversification actually slowed when they arrived, so their anatomy originally must have been suited for some other purpose.

As the temperatures in the seas increased, the larger animals of the early Mesozoic gradually began to disappear while smaller animals of all kinds, including [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, and perhaps the ancestor [[mammal]]s to [[primate]]s, evolved. The KT extinction exacerbated this trend. The large archosaurs became extinct, while birds and mammals thrived, as they do today.

=== Cenozoic life ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The Cenozoic era covers the 65.5 million years since the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]].
The Cenozoic is the ''age of new life''. During this era, mammals diverged from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of terrestrial, marine, and flying animals.
As the [[dinosaur]]s perished at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, the [[mammal]]s took center stage. The mammals are the largest land animals of the Era, as the dinosaurs had been during the Mesozoic.<ref name=cenlifefm>{{cite web

The fossil record provides us with a few cases of exceptional preservation around the end of this explosion, with famous units such as the [[Burgess shale]] offering a glimpse into a bustling yet strikingly different world, in stark contrast to the microbe-dominated seas of just 80 million years before.

The Cambrian explosion has generated extensive scientific debate. The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted as early as the mid 19th century;<ref name=Buckland1841>{{cite book

The Cambrian explosion has proven difficult to study, partly because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across disparate [[continent]]s.  It should be borne in mind that absolute [[radiometric dating|radiometric]] dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by detailed analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks,  have only rather recently become available<ref>e.g. {{cite journal

===Ordovician-Silurian extinction events===
{{Main|Ordovician-Silurian extinction events}}
{{annotated image/Extinction}}

The extinctions occurred approximately 444&ndash;447 million years ago and mark the boundary between the [[Ordovician Period|Ordovician]] and the following [[Silurian Period]]s.  During this extinction event, which may have been composed of several distinct closely spaced events, there were several marked changes in biologically responsive [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope]]s, which may indicate separate events or particular phases within one event. 

At that time most complex [[multicellular organism]]s lived in the sea, and around 100 marine [[Scientific classification|families]] became extinct, covering about 49 percent<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rohde & Muller|year=2005|title=Cycles in Fossil Diversity|journal=Nature|volume=434|pages=208&ndash;210|doi=10.1038/nature03339|issue=7030}}</ref> of [[genus|genera]] of [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] (a more reliable estimate than species). The [[brachiopod]]s and [[bryozoan]]s were decimated, along with many of the [[trilobite]], [[conodont]] and [[graptolite]] families.

Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions  than by a decrease in [[speciation]].<ref name=Bambach>{{Citation | last=Bambach | first=R.K. | last2=Knoll | first2=A.H. | last3=Wang | first3=S.C. | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=Paleobiology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522&ndash;542 | date=December 2004 | url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&issn=0094-8373&volume=30&page=522 | accessdate=[[2007-10-07]]}}</ref>

===Late Devonian extinction===
{{Main|Late Devonian extinction}}
The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems, including the [[stromatoporoid]]s, and the [[rugosa|rugose]] and [[tabulate coral]]s. The reef system collapse was so severe that major reef-building (effected by new families of carbonate-excreting organisms, the modern scleractinian  corals) did not recover until the Mesozoic era. 

The late Devonian crash in [[biodiversity]] was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the [[Cretaceous]]: a recent survey (McGhee 1996) estimates that 22 percent of all the ''[[Family (biology)|families]]'' of marine animals (largely [[invertebrate]]s) were eliminated, the category of families offering a broad range of real structural diversity.<ref>McGhee, George R., Jr, 1996. ''The Late Devonian Mass Extinction: the Frasnian/Famennian Crisis'' (Columbia University Press) [http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/28695 reviewed by Sherman J. Suter, Smithsonian]</ref> Some 57 percent of the [[Genus|genera]] went extinct, and&mdash;the estimate most likely to be adjusted&mdash;at least 75 percent of the species did not survive into the following [[Carboniferous]]. The estimates of species loss depend on surveys of marine taxa that are perhaps not well enough known to assess their true rate of losses, and for the Devonian it is not easy to allow for possible effects of differential preservation and [[sampling bias]]es. Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the [[brachiopod]]s, [[trilobite]]s, [[ammonite]]s, [[conodont]]s, and [[acritarch]]s, as well as [[Agnatha|jawless fish]], and all [[placoderm]]s. Freshwater species, including our [[tetrapod]] ancestors, were less affected.

it is harder to produce such detailed statistics for land, river, swamp and lake environments because good Permian-Triassic rock sequences from terrestrial environments are extremely rare (the [[Karoo|Karoo basin]] is by far the best).

* Large herbivores suffered the heaviest losses.

The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event occurred 200 million years ago and is one of the major [[extinction event]]s of the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans.  Twenty percent of all marine families and all large [[Crurotarsi]] (non-dinosaurian [[archosaur]]s), some remaining [[therapsid]]s, and many of the large [[amphibia]]ns were wiped out.  At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct.

The Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event was the catastrophic mass [[extinction]] of extant animal species in a comparatively short period of time, approximately 65.5 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]].

Most, if not all, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s became extinct during or possibly a few years after the event.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Favstovsky, D.E.; P.M.

Many other groups of animals and plants, including [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and some [[invertebrate]]s, also became extinct at the K–T boundary. The event marks the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, and the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.

Most of the extinctions occurred in a relatively short time because extensive weather changes reduced [[photosynthesis]], thereby decreasing the amount of plant material available to [[herbivore|herbivorous animals]].  This change in food supply caused a massive disruption in Earth's ecology.

Despite the severity of the K–T extinction event, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction of different classes of organisms.  Organisms which depended on [[photosynthesis]] became extinct or suffered heavy losses due to reduced [[sunlight]].  Photosynthesizing organisms, from [[plankton]] (e.g. [[coccolithophorids]]) to land [[plant]]s, formed the primary part of the food chain in the late Cretaceous.  [[Herbivores|Herbivorous]] animals, which depended on plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, top [[predators]] such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' also began dying.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilf, P.; K.R.

Animals which built [[calcium carbonate]] shells (for example, coccolithophorids along with many groups of [[mollusc]]s, including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, [[fresh water]] [[snail]]s and [[mussel]]s), as well as organisms whose [[food chain]] depended on these [[calcium carbonate]] shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses.

Most omnivores, insectivores and [[carrion]]-eaters appear to have survived quite well. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals. Many mammals, and the birds which survived the extinction, fed on [[insect]]s, [[larva]]e, [[worm]]s, snails, etc., which in turn fed on dead plant matter. They may have survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they lived in "[[Detritus (biology)|detritus]]-based" food chains.<ref name="SheehanHansen">{{cite journal| last =Sheehan| first =P.| coauthors =T.A.

In [[stream]] [[Biocoenosis|communities]] few groups of animals became extinct. Stream communities tend to rely less on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from land. This may have buffered them from extinction.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Major extinctions of land-dwelling vertebrates at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, eastern Montana|author=Sheehan, P.M.; D.E.

Extinction was more severe among animals living in the [[Pelagic zone|water column]], than among animals living on or in the sea floor.

The largest air-breathing survivors, [[crocodilian]]s and [[champsosaur]]s, were semi-aquatic. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food. Modern crocodilian young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. This has been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.<ref name="SheehanHansen"/>

===Holocene extinction event===
{{Main|Holocene extinction event}}
[[Image:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Dodo]], a bird of Mauritius, became extinct during the mid-late 17th century after humans destroyed the [[forest]]s where the birds made their homes and introduced animals that ate their eggs.]]
The Holocene extinction event is a name customarily given to the widespread, ongoing [[mass extinction]] of [[species]] during the modern [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]. The large number of extinctions span numerous families of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s  including [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[arthropod]]s; a sizeable fraction of these extinctions are occurring in the [[rainforest]]s.  Because the rate of this [[extinction event]] appears to be much more rapid than the "Big Five" mass extinctions, it is also known as the ''Sixth Extinction''.  Since 1500 AD, 784 extinctions have been documented by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]].<ref>(2006). "[http://www.iucn.org/bookstore/HTML-books/Red%20List%202004/completed/Executive%20Summary.html Executive Summary: The Status of Globally Threatened Species]". ''The World Conservation Union. Retrieved on [[2007-10-07]].</ref>  However, since most extinctions are likely to go undocumented, scientists estimate that during the last century, between 20,000 and two million species have become extinct, but the precise total cannot be determined more accurately within the limits of present knowledge.  Up to 140,000 species per year (based on [[Species-area curve|Species-area theory]])<ref>Pimm, S.L.; G.J. Russell, J.L. Gittleman, T.M. Brooks (1995). ''The Future of Biodiversity'', Science 269: 347&ndash;50.</ref> may be the present rate of extinction based upon upper bound estimating.

In broad usage, the Holocene extinction event includes the notable disappearance of large [[mammal]]s, known as [[megafauna]], by the end of the [[last ice age]] 9,000 to 13,000 years ago.  Such disappearances have been considered as either a response to climate change, a result of the [[overpopulation|proliferation]] of [[modern human]]s, or both.  These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]] / Holocene boundary, are sometimes referred to as the ''[[New World Pleistocene Extinctions|Pleistocene Extinction Event]]'' or Ice Age extinction event.  However the Holocene extinction event continues through the events of the past several millennia and includes the present time.

The observed rate of extinction has accelerated dramatically in the last 50 years, to a pace greater than the rate seen during the Big Five.  There is no general agreement on whether to consider more recent extinctions as a distinct event or merely part of a single escalating process.  Only during these most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses. Overall, the Holocene extinction event is most significantly characterised by the presence of man-made driving factors and its very short [[geological timescale]] (tens to thousands of years) compared to most other extinction events.

Significantly, the rate of species extinctions at present is estimated at 100 to 1000 times "background" or average extinction rates in the [[evolution]]ary time scale of planet [[Earth]].<ref>Lawton, J.H.; R.M. May (1995). ''Extinction rates''. Oxford, UK: [[Oxford University]] Press. [[Special:Booksources/019854829x|019854829x]].</ref>

===Prokaryote===
{{Main|Prokaryote}}
It is generally accepted that the [[origin of life|first living cells]] were some form of prokaryote and may have developed out of [[protobionts]]. Fossilized prokaryotes approximately 3.5 billion years old have been discovered, and prokaryotes are the most successful and abundant organism even today. In contrast the eukaryote only appeared between approximately 1.7 and 2.2 billion years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Eukaryotes with no mitochondria|author=Cavalier-Smith, T.|date=1987|journal=Nature|volume=326|pages=332&ndash;3|doi=10.1038/326332a0}}</ref>  While Earth is the only known place in the universe where life exist, some have suggested structures within a Martian [[meteorite]] should be interpreted as fossil prokaryotes; this is open to considerable debate and skepticism. 

Prokaryotes diversified greatly throughout their long existence. The metabolism of prokaryotes is far more varied than that of [[eukaryote]]s, leading to many highly distinct types of prokaryotes.  For example, in addition to using [[photosynthesis]] or organic compounds for energy like eukaryotes do, prokaryotes may obtain energy from inorganic chemicals such as [[hydrogen sulfide]].

===Eukaryote===
{{Main|Eukaryote}}
[[Image:Fiveking.PNG|thumb|right|175px|The original, now outdated, five-kingdom system.]]
The origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life, since they include all complex cells and almost all multi-cellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll (1992) suggests they developed approximately 1.6 to 2.1 billion years ago.<ref>{{cite journal

There are two main lineages within eukaryotes: [[unikont]]s, which include [[animal]]s, [[fungi]], the [[Amoebozoa]], and [[choanoflagellate]]s, and [[bikont]]s, which include the [[Rhizaria]], [[Excavate]]s, [[Primoplantae|plants and relatives]], [[Chromista|Chromist]]s, and [[Alveolate]]s.

Eukaryotes became capable of [[photosynthesis]] when a [[cyanobacterium]] was engulfed by an ancestor to the [[Primoplantae]] (the group including [[green algae]], [[red algae]], and [[plant]]s).  Subsequently, green and red algae themselves became [[endosymbiont]]s in a variety of eukaryote lines, a process which has happened multiple times.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1481 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1481–1493 | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J.

The [[mitochondria]] of eukaryotes also derive from endosymbiosis and all eukaryotes have them, with the exception of a few groups (not related to each other) which instead have modified mitrochondria known as [[hydrogenosome]]s and [[mitosome]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tovar J, Fischer A, Clark CG |title=The mitosome, a novel organelle related to mitochondria in the amitochondrial parasite Entamoeba histolytica |journal=Mol.

===Archaea===
{{Main|Archaea}}
The Archaea are a major group of [[microorganism]]s. Archaea are similar to other [[prokaryote]]s in most aspects of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] structure and [[metabolism]]. However, their genetic [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]]&mdash;the two central processes in [[molecular biology]]&mdash;do not show many typical bacterial features, and are in many aspects similar to those of [[eukaryote]]s. For instance, archaean translation uses eukaryotic-like initiation and elongation factors, and their transcription involves [[TATA Binding Protein]]s and TFIIB as in eukaryotes. Many archaeal tRNA and rRNA genes harbor unique archaeal [[introns]] which are neither like eukaryotic introns, nor like bacterial (type I and type II etc which can "home") introns.

Archaea were identified in 1977 by [[Carl Woese]] and [[George E. Fox]] as being a separate branch based on their separation from other prokaryotes on 16S [[rRNA]] [[phylogenetic tree]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Woese, C.; G. Fox | title = Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: the primary kingdoms | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 5088&ndash;90 | year = 1977 | pmid = 270744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088}}</ref> These two groups were originally named the Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, treated as [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s or subkingdoms, which Woese and Fox termed Urkingdoms. Woese argued that they represented fundamentally different branches of living things. He later renamed the groups Archaea and [[Bacteria]] to emphasize this, and argued that together with [[Eukaryota|Eukarya]] they compose [[three-domain system|three Domains]] of living organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Woese, C.R.; O. Kandler, M.L.

The Archaea should not be confused with the [[geological]] term ''[[Archean]] eon'', also known as the ''Archeozoic era''. This refers to the primordial period of [[Earth]] history when Archaea and Bacteria were the only [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] organisms living on the planet.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Altermann, W.; J.

== Evolution of sex ==
{{Main|Evolution of sex}}

The evolution of sex is a major puzzle. The first [[fossil]]ized evidence of sexually reproducing [[organism]]s is from [[eukaryote]]s of the [[Stenian]] period, about 1.2 to 1 billion years ago with [[DNA]] forming 3.5 to 4.6 billion years.{{Verify source|date=April 2008}} Sexual reproduction is the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority of visible organisms, including almost all [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s. [[Bacterial conjugation]], the transfer of [[DNA]] between two [[bacteria]], is often mistakenly confused with sexual reproduction, because the mechanics are similar.

Organisms need to replicate their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage is one of the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. [[Diploid]] individuals can repair a mutated section of its DNA via [[homologous recombination]], since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and one copy is presumed to be undamaged. A mutation in an [[haploid]] individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become resident, as the [[DNA repair]] machinery has no way of knowing what the original undamaged sequence was.<ref name="dna-repair">{{cite journal | author = Bernstein, H.; H. Byerly, F. Hopf, R. Michod | title = Origin of sex | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 323&ndash;51 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6209512 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5193(84)80178-2}}</ref>  The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.<ref name="tatiana">{{cite book | author = Judson, O. | title = Dr. Tatiana's sex advice to all creation | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | year = 2002 | id = ISBN 0-8050-6331-5 | pages =233&ndash;4}}</ref>

Another theory is that sexual reproduction originated from [[Selfish DNA|selfish parasitic genetic elements]] that exchange genetic material (that is: copies of their own genome) for their transmission and propagation. In some organisms, sexual reproduction has been shown to enhance the spread of parasitic genetic elements (e.g. yeast, filamentous fungi).<ref name="hickey">{{cite journal | author = Hickey, D. | title = Selfish DNA: a sexually-transmitted nuclear parasite | journal = Genetics | volume = 101 | issue = 3&ndash;4 | pages = 519&ndash;31 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6293914}}</ref>  [[Bacterial conjugation]], a form of genetic exchange that some sources describe as sex, is not a form of reproduction.  However, it does support the selfish genetic element theory, as it is propagated through such a "selfish gene", the [[F-plasmid]].<ref name="tatiana"/>

A third theory is that sex evolved as a form of cannibalism.  One primitive organism ate another one, but rather than completely digesting it, some of the 'eaten' organism's DNA was incorporated into the 'eater' organism.<ref name="tatiana"/>

A theory states that sexual reproduction evolved from ancient [[haloarchaea]] through a combination of [[jumping genes]], and swapping [[plasmid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Extreme Microbes | first=S. | last=DasSarma | contribution=Extreme Microbes | work=American Scientist | year=2007 | volume=95 | pages= page 224&ndash;31 }}</ref>

A comprehensive ''origin of sex as vaccination'' theory proposes that eukaryan sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection when infected hosts began swapping nuclearized genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by more virulent symbionts. Sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) then evolved as a host strategy to uncouple (and thereby emasculate) the acquired symbiont genomes.<ref name="sterrer">{{cite journal | author = Sterrer, W. | title = On the origin of sex as vaccination | journal =  Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 216 | pages = 387&ndash;96 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3008}}</ref>
