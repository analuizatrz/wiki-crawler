The idea behind the Royal Rumble match is credited to [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]].<ref name=pat>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/patpatterson/bio/|title=Hall of Fame: Pat Patterson|accessdate=2007-12-03|publisher= WWE}}</ref> Before the match begins, the contestants draw spots in the Rumble.<ref name=wwematch/> The match consists of thirty men, beginning with the two men who chose entry numbers one and two in the ring.<ref name=wwematch/> At regular timed intervals, usually ninety seconds, one of the remaining 28 wrestlers enters the ring.<ref name=wwematch/> Participants must eliminate all other opponents, and the winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated.<ref name=wwematch/><ref name=mysterio/>

Similar to a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]], a wrestler is eliminated when leaving the ring over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor.<ref name=wwematch/><ref name=stats/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/battleroyal|title=Specialty Matches: Battle Royal|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> A referee, who is situated at ringside, must witness an elimination in order for it to be valid.<ref name=RR97>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/1988114111/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1997: Main Event| publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-03|quote=Stone Cold was actually eliminated during the match, but the referees failed to detect it, so he sneaked back in.}}</ref> A wrestler who is eliminated without a referee noticing may sometimes sneak back into the match. For example, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] was eliminated during the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 event]], but he re-entered without the referees' knowledge and eventually won the match.<ref name=RR97/> Moreover, a wrestler who exits the ring without going over the top rope is not eliminated from the contest. During the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Rumble match]], both [[Vince McMahon]] and Steve Austin left the ring, only to return later in the match.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1999: Main Event|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2007-12-30}}</ref> In the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|1994]] match, the last two participants [[Bret Hart]] and [[Lex Luger]] were declared co-winners when it was decided that both of their feet touched the floor at exactly the same time.<ref name=RR94>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811421/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1994: Main Event|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref> A similar situation occurred in the [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005]] match, however the match was restarted after [[Dave Batista|Batista]] and [[John Cena]] eliminated each other at the same time. Batista eliminated Cena afterwards to win the match.<ref name=RR05>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1995: Main Event|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2007-12-05}}</ref>

The reward for the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]] was the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]].<ref name=RR92>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881152/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1992: Main Event|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2007-12-05}}</ref> The tradition of granting a [[WWE Championship]] match at [[WrestleMania]] started in 1993.<ref name=about>{{cite web|url= http://prowrestling.about.com/od/thewrestlers/a/rumblewinnerfat.htm|title=The Fate of the Royal Rumble Winner|author=Eric Cohen|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2007-12-09|date=2007-04-25}}</ref> Despite being introduced in late 2002, it was not until 2004 that a winner had the choice of fighting for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] instead of the WWE Championship at WrestleMania.<ref name=about/> Due to the revival of the [[ECW Championship|ECW World Championship]] as a brand championship in mid-2006, the 2007 event added this championship as a choice to the winning stipulation.<ref name=ecwtitle>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02052007/|title=Tickets punched for WrestleMania|author=Brett Hoffman|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2007-12-05|date=2007-02-05}}</ref> From 2001 to 2007 the Royal Rumble match winner has gone on to win a World Championship title at WrestleMania.<ref name=facts/> After winning the 2008 match, [[John Cena]] became the first to use his championship opportunity at an event other than WrestleMania.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/matches/6235888/preview/|accessdate=2008-01-28|title=Randy Orton vs. John Cena (WWE Championship match): A battle for redemption with 'Mania implications|publisher=WWE|date=2008-01-28}}</ref> He also became the first man since 2000 to win the Royal Rumble match but fail to win the title in his championship opportunity as a result.

===Pay-per-view===
The Royal Rumble is a [[pay-per-view]] consisting of the Royal Rumble match, championship matches, and various other matches. The first Royal Rumble took place on January 24, 1988 and was broadcast live on the [[USA Network]].<ref name=RF161/> The following year, the event was rebranded as a pay-per-view.<ref name=pwh>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html#89|title=Royal Rumble results|publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com|accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref> It is part of WWE's "classic five" pay-per-views, along with [[WrestleMania]], [[Survivor Series]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[King of the Ring]].<ref name=Main166>Brian Shields. ''Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s'' (p.166)</ref>

The Royal Rumble match is usually situated at the top of the [[List of professional wrestling slang#C|card]].<ref name=guard>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2007/01/28/3473071.html|title=Old guard dominates Rumble| author=Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-09|date=2007-01-29}}</ref> This, however, is not always the case, as the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 event]] had the match in the middle of the pay-per-view.<ref name=guard/>

The first Rumble match featured only twenty men,<ref name=RR88>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/1988114/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1988: Main Event|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> and it was called the Rumble Royale.<ref name=RF161>Ric Flair. ''Ric Flair: To Be the Man'' (p.161)</ref> It lasted approximately thirty-three minutes of the two-hour broadcast.<ref name=facts>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/facts/|title=Royal Rumble: Facts & Figures|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> The modern Rumble matches are much longer, with the longest match, at the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|2002 event]], lasting over one hour and nine minutes of an approximately three-hour pay-per-view.<ref name=facts/>

With the [[WWE Brand Extension|brand extension]] introduced in mid-2002, the 30 entrants from 2003 to 2006 consisted of 15 wrestlers from both the [[WWE Raw|RAW]] and [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]] brands. At first, the winner of the match received a shot at his brand's champion.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2004/01/26/325195.html|title=Benoit wins the 'Rumble'|author=John Powell| publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-23|date=2004-01-26}}</ref> Starting in 2004, the Rumble winner had the option of challenging either brand's champion.<ref name=about/> For instance, [[Chris Benoit]] switched brands in 2004 and won the World Heavyweight Championship.<ref name=about/> The 2007 Royal Rumble marked the first year participants from the [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] brand competed along with the RAW and SmackDown! brands.<ref name=RR07>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/2007/matches/35535102/results/|title=A Phenom-enal Rumble|author=Louie Dee|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2007-12-05|date=2007-01-28}}</ref> The winner of the Royal Rumble now has the option to challenge for the [[ECW Championship]] as well.<ref name=ecwtitle/>

The [[Royal Rumble (2008)|2008 Royal Rumble]] was the first WWE pay-per-view to be available in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].<ref name=rrhd>{{cite web| url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/wwehdfaqs|title=How do I get WWE HD on my HDTV?|last=Clayton|first= Cory|accessdate=2008-01-20|publisher=WWE}}</ref>
