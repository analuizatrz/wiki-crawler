== Trivia ==
*Mainly due to the similarities in vocal style, the group is often mistaken for [[Metallica]]. As an example, many people have downloaded Eternal Decision's songs in P2P programs like [[Ares Galaxy]] or [[LimeWire]] believing they're singles or demos from Metallica's 2008 New Album, ''[[Death Magnetic]]''. As another example, the song ''[[Hunger]]'' from the [[self titled]] debut album received many downloads on [[Napster]] due to the fact that many people falsely believed it to be a new unreleased Metallica song or a collaboration between [[Megadeth]] and [[Metallica]]. <ref>
