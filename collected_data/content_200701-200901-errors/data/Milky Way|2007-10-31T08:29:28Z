The '''Milky Way''' (a translation of the [[Latin]] ''Via Lactea'', in turn derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Γαλαξίας'' (Galaxias) sometimes referred to simply as "[[Galaxy#Etymology|the Galaxy]]"), is a [[barred spiral galaxy]] that is part of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies.  Although the Milky Way is one of [[Hubble Deep Field|billions of galaxies]] in the [[observable universe]],<ref>Between 1{{e|10}} and 8{{e|10}}</ref> the Galaxy has special significance to [[human]]ity as it is the home galaxy of the planet [[Earth]].  The Milky Way galaxy is visible from [[Earth]] as a band of light in the night sky, and it is the appearance of this band of light which has inspired the name for our galaxy.

Some sources hold that, strictly speaking, the term "Milky Way" should refer exclusively to the band of light, while the full name '''Milky Way Galaxy,''' or alternatively '''the Galaxy''' should be used to describe our galaxy as a whole.<ref>

Visible from [[Earth]] as a hazy band of [[white]] [[light]] that is seen in the [[night sky]], arching across the entire [[celestial sphere]], the visual [[phenomenon]] of the Milky Way (as seen in the [[night]] [[sky]]) originates from [[star]]s and other material which lies within the galactic plane.  

The Milky Way appears brightest in the direction of the [[constellation]] of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], toward the [[galactic center]]. Relative to the [[celestial equator]], it passes as far north as the constellation of [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] and as far south as the constellation of [[Crux]], indicating the high inclination of Earth's [[equator|equatorial plane]] and the plane of the [[ecliptic]] relative to the galactic plane. The fact that the Milky Way divides the night sky into two roughly equal [[celestial sphere|hemispheres]] indicates that our Solar System lies close to the [[galactic plane]]. The Milky Way has a relatively low [[surface brightness]], making it difficult to see from any [[urban]] or [[suburban]] location suffering from [[light pollution]].

This estimate is based on research done in 2004 by astronomers Luca Pasquini, Piercarlo Bonifacio, Sofia Randich, Daniele Galli, and Raffaele G. Gratton. The team used the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the [[Very Large Telescope]] to [[Measurement|measure]], for the first time, the [[beryllium]] content of two stars in [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 6397]]. This allowed them to deduce the elapsed time between the rise of the first generation of stars in the entire Galaxy and the first generation of stars in the cluster, at 200 million to 300 million years. By including the estimated age of the stars in the globular cluster (13.4 ± 0.8 billion years), they estimated the age of the oldest stars in the Milky Way at 13.6 ± 0.8 billion years. (See also [[nucleocosmochronology]].)  Based upon this emerging science, the Galactic thin disk is estimated to have been formed between 8.3 ± 1.8 billion years ago.{{fact|date=2007-10-31}}

In 2005, observations by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] backed up previously collected evidence that suggested the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy. It consists of a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a disk of [[interstellar medium|gas, dust]] and stars. Within the disk region are several arm structures that spiral outward in a [[logarithmic spiral]] shape.

The Galaxy's bar is thought to be about 27,000 light-years long, running through its center at a 44 ± 10 degree angle to the line between the Sun and the center of the Galaxy. It is composed primarily of red stars, believed to be ancient (see [[red dwarf]], [[red giant]]). The bar is surrounded by a ring called the "5-[[Kiloparsec|kpc]] ring" that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Galaxy, as well as most of the Milky Way's [[star formation]] activity. Viewed from the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], it would be the brightest feature of our own galaxy.<ref name="fn14">{{cite web

===Spiral arms===
Each spiral arm describes a [[logarithmic spiral]] (as do the arms of all spiral galaxies) with a pitch of approximately 12 degrees. There are believed to be four major spiral arms which all start at the Galaxy's center. These are named as follows, according to the image at left:

Outside of the major spiral arms is the [[Outer Ring]] or [[Monoceros Ring]], a ring of stars around the Milky Way proposed by astronomers Brian Yanny and Heidi Jo Newberg, which consists of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago.

As is typical for many galaxies, the distribution of mass in the Milky Way Galaxy is such that the [[orbital speed]] of most stars in the Galaxy does not depend strongly on its distance from the center. Away from the central bulge or outer rim, the typical stellar velocity is between 210 and 240&nbsp;km/s.<ref name="fn4">{{cite web

 | accessdate=2007-05-10 }}</ref> Hence the [[orbital period]] of the typical star is directly proportional only to the length of the path traveled. This is unlike in the Solar System where different orbits are also expected to have significantly different velocities associated with them, and is one of the major pieces of evidence for the existence of [[dark matter]]. Another interesting aspect is the so-called "wind-up problem" of the spiral arms. If one believes that the inner parts of the arms rotate faster than the outer part, then the Galaxy will wind up so much that the spiral structure will be thinned out. But this is not what is observed in spiral galaxies; instead, astronomers propose that the spiral arms form as a result of a matter-density wave emanating from the galactic center. This can be likened to a moving traffic jam on a highway—the cars are all moving, but there is always a region of slow-moving cars. Thus this results in several spiral arms where there are a lot of stars and gas. This model also agrees with enhanced star formation in or near spiral arms; the compressional waves increase the density of molecular Hydrogen and protostars form as a result.

However, a few globular clusters have been found farther, such as PAL 4 and AM1 at more than 200,000 light-years away from the galactic center. While the disk contains gas and dust obscuring the view in some wavelengths, the spheroid component does not. Active [[star formation]] takes place in the disk (especially in the spiral arms, which represent areas of high density), but not in the halo. [[Open cluster]]s also occur primarily in the disk.

On [[January 9]] [[2006]], [[Mario Juric]] and others of [[Princeton University]] announced that the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] of the northern sky found a huge and diffuse structure (spread out across an area around 5,000 times the size of a full moon) within the Milky Way that does not seem to fit within current models. The collection of stars rises close to perpendicular to the plane of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. The proposed likely interpretation is that a [[dwarf galaxy]] is merging with the Milky Way. This galaxy is tentatively named the [[Virgo Stellar Stream]] and is found in the direction of [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] about 30,000 light-years away.

{{main|Local group|Andromeda-Milky Way collision}}
The Milky Way and the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] are a [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] of giant spiral galaxies. Together with their companion galaxies they form the [[Local Group]], a group of some 50 closely bound galaxies. The Local Group is part of the [[Virgo Supercluster]].

The Milky Way is orbited by two smaller galaxies and a number of [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] in the Local Group. The largest of these is the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] with a diameter of 20,000 light-years. It has a close companion, the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]. The [[Magellanic Stream]] is a peculiar streamer of neutral [[hydrogen]] gas connecting these two small galaxies. The stream is thought to have been dragged from the Magellanic Clouds in tidal interactions with the Galaxy. Some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way are [[Canis Major Dwarf]] (the closest), [[Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]], [[Ursa Minor Dwarf]], [[Sculptor Dwarf]], [[Sextans Dwarf]], [[Fornax Dwarf]], and [[Leo I Dwarf]]. The smallest Milky Way dwarf galaxies are only 500 light-years in diameter. These include [[Carina Dwarf]], [[Draco Dwarf]], and [[Leo II (dwarf galaxy)|Leo II Dwarf]]. There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies, which are dynamically bound to the Milky Way. Observations through the [[zone of avoidance]] are frequently detecting new distant and nearby galaxies. Some galaxies consisting mostly of gas and dust may also have evaded detection so far.

In January 2006, researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they circle the Galaxy, causing vibrations at certain frequencies when they pass through its edges.<ref>{{cite press release

}}</ref>  Previously, these two galaxies, at around 2% of the mass of the Milky Way, were considered too small to influence the Milky Way. However, by taking into account [[dark matter]], the movement of these two galaxies creates a wake that influences the larger Milky Way. Taking dark matter into account results in an approximately twentyfold increase in mass for the Galaxy. This calculation is according to a computer model made by Martin Weinberg of the [[University of Massachusetts, Amherst]]. In this model, the dark matter is spreading out from the galactic disc with the known gas layer. As a result, the model predicts that the gravitational impact of the Magellanic Clouds is amplified as they pass through the Galaxy.

Current measurements suggest the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is approaching us at 100 to 140 kilometers per second. The Milky Way may collide with it in 3 to 4 billion years, depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion. If they collide, it is thought that the Sun and the other stars in the Milky Way will probably not collide with the stars of the Andromeda Galaxy, but that the two galaxies will merge to form a single [[elliptical galaxy]] over the course of about a billion years.<ref>{{cite news | first=Janet | last=Wong | title=Astrophysicist maps out our own galaxy's end | publisher=University of Toronto | date=April 14, 2000 | url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin/000414b.asp | accessdate=2007-01-11 }}</ref>

In the general sense, the absolute velocity of any object through space is not a meaningful question according to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Special Theory of Relativity]], which declares that there is no "preferred" [[inertial frame of reference]] in space with which to compare the Galaxy's motion. (Motion must always be specified with respect to another object.)

Many astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 600&nbsp;km per second relative to the observed locations of other nearby galaxies. Most recent estimates range from 130&nbsp;km/s to 1,000&nbsp;km/s. If the Galaxy is moving at 600&nbsp;km/s, Earth travels 51.84 million km per day, or more than 18.9 billion km per year, about 4.5 times its closest distance from [[Pluto]]. The Galaxy is thought to be moving towards the constellation [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], and may someday become a close-knit member of the [[Virgo cluster]] of galaxies.

Another reference frame is provided by the [[Cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). The Milky Way is moving at around 552&nbsp;km/s<ref name="dipole">{{cite journal

This can be observed by satellites such as [[COBE]] and [[WMAP]] as a dipole contribution to the CMB, as photons in equilibrium at the CMB frame get [[Doppler effect|blue-shifted]] in the direction of the motion and [[redshift|red-shifted]] in the opposite direction.

===Etymology and beliefs===
[[Image:Jacopo Tintoretto 011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacopo Tintoretto]]'s "''The Origin of the Milky Way''"]]
{{main|List of names for the Milky Way|Milky Way (mythology)}}
There are many [[creation myth]]s around the world which explain the origin of the Milky Way and give it its name. The [[English language|English]] phrase is a translation from Greek Γαλαξίας ''Galaxias'', which is derived from the word for [[milk]] (γάλα, ''gala''). This is also the origin of the word [[galaxy]]. In [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]], the Milky Way was caused by milk spilt by [[Hera]] when suckled by [[Heracles]].

The term ''Milky Way'' first appeared in [[English literature]] in a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].
{{Quote|"See yonder, lo, the Galaxyë<br />&nbsp;Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,<br />&nbsp;For hit is whyt."|Geoffrey Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''c.'' 1380.<ref>{{cite web

In a large area from [[Central Asia]] to [[Africa]], the name for the Milky Way is related to the word for [[straw]]. It has been claimed that this was spread by [[Arab]]s who in turn borrowed the word from [[Armenian language|Armenian]].<ref>{{cite journal

The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name "Silver River" (銀河) is used throughout [[East Asia]], including [[Korea]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], "Silver River" (銀河) means galaxies in general and the Milky Way is called the "Silver River System" (銀河系) or the "River of Heaven" (天の川). In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], it is called''Vintergatan'', or "Winter Street", because the stars in the belt were used to predict time of the approaching winter.

[[Image:Herschel-Galaxy.png|thumb|right|The shape of the Milky Way as deduced from star counts by William Herschel in 1785; the solar system was assumed near center.]]
The [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Democritus]] (450 BC–370 BC) was the first known person to propose that the Milky Way might consist of distant stars. Actual proof of this came in 1610 when [[Galileo Galilei]] used a [[Optical telescope|telescope]] to study the Milky Way and discovered that it was composed of a huge number of faint stars.<ref>{{cite web | author=J. J. O'Connor, E. F. Robertson |date = November 2002 | url = http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Galileo.html | title = Galileo Galilei | publisher = University of St Andrews | accessdate = 2007-01-08 }}</ref> In a treatise in 1755, [[Immanuel Kant]], drawing on earlier work by [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]], speculated (correctly) that the Milky Way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars, held together by [[gravitation|gravitational forces]] akin to the Solar System but on much larger scales. The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. Kant also conjectured that some of the [[nebula]]e visible in the night sky might be separate "galaxies" themselves, similar to our own.<ref name="our_galaxy">{{cite web | last = Evans | first = J. C. |date= [[November 24]] [[1998]] | url = http://physics.gmu.edu/~jevans/astr103/CourseNotes/ECText/ch20_txt.htm | title = Our Galaxy | publisher = George Mason University | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref>

The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the [[Sun]] within it was carried out by [[William Herschel]] in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the Galaxy with the solar system close to the center.

In 1845, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.<ref>{{cite web | last = Abbey | first = Lenny | url = http://labbey.com/Telescopes/Parsontown.html | title = The Earl of Rosse and the Leviathan of Parsontown | publisher = The Compleat Amateur Astronomer | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref>

[[Image:Pic iroberts1.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of the "Great Andromeda Nebula" from 1899, later identified as the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]]]
In 1917, [[Heber Curtis]] had observed the nova [[S Andromedae]] within the "Great [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] Nebula" ([[Messier object]] [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]]). Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more [[nova]]e. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred within our galaxy. As a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the "island universes" hypothesis, which held that the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Heber D. Curtis | authorlink=Heber Doust Curtis | title=Novae in Spiral Nebulae and the Island Universe Theory | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | year=1988 | volume=100 | pages=6 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988PASP..100....6C }}</ref> In 1920 the [[The Great Debate|Great Debate]] took place between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Heber Curtis, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula was an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Harold F. | last=Weaver | url = http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/rtrumpler.html | title = Robert Julius Trumpler | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref>

The matter was conclusively settled by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the early 1920s using a new telescope. He was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some [[Cepheid variable]]s, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant to be part of the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite journal | author=E.
