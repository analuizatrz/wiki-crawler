'''Wellington''' is a small industrial town in rural [[Somerset]], [[England]], situated seven [[mile]]s south west of [[Taunton]] in the [[Taunton Deane]] district, near the border with [[Devon]], which runs along the [[Blackdown Hills]] to the south of the town. The town has a [[population]] of 13,696.{{ref|population}} It has many dependent villages including West Buckland, Langford Budville, Nynehead, Sampford Arundel and Sampford Moor. Rockwell Green is a formerly-independent village to the West of the town and while there is a [[green belt]] of land in between them, many consider it to be part of the town.

In the 1970s, housing developments happened on the South side of the town, prompted by its proximity to Junction 26 of the [[M5 motorway]].

The town had [[Wellington (Somerset) railway station|its own railway station]] on the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] from [[1 May]] [[1843]] until [[5 October]] [[1964]]. It was an important place where extra locomotives were attached to heavy trains to help them up the incline to Whiteball Tunnel.  The [[Reading to Plymouth Line|railway from Penzance to London]], and also to [[Bristol]] and the North, continue to pass through the town, but no trains stop.

Wellington gave its name to the first [[Duke of Wellington]], [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of       Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], and boasts a large obelisk to his honour, spotlit, on top of the closest hill to the town, the Wellington Monument. This is now separated from the town by the major motorway in the South-West, the [[M5 motorway|M5]]. Because of this, Wellington, Somerset can have a legitimate claim to have contributed to the more widespread use of the term in other place names and, of course, the Wellington Boot.
Wellington's main industry was wool-making, but this has now declined. The Fox family, still one of the more renowned names in the town, was at the forefront of this, and the name still lives on today. However, the town is still largely dependent on industry, notably its [[Aerosol spray|aerosol]] factory making aerosols for big names such as Marks and Spencer and Gillette. The company, now called Swallowfield, benefitted from the growth of own-brand products during the 1970s. The company dates back to 1950 though, when it was named Walter Gregory and Co. and produced the first consumer aerosols. The company has also been known as Aerosols International and was, for a time, owned by [[Cadbury Schweppes]]. After a management buyout in 1986, Swallowfield was then listed on the stock exchange. However, the company has recently been hit with the loss of a contract with Marks and Spencer, bringing estimated losses of Â£2 million.

The other big industry is bed making under the [[Relyon]] name. Relyon is now South-African owned and for many years has provided its own brand beds as well as making beds (and formerly furniture) for other high street names such as Marks and Spencer.

Wellington is also famous for its [[public school]], [[Wellington School, Somerset]], not to be confused with [[Wellington School, Shropshire]] or [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]]. Famous alumni of Wellington School include actor David Suchet and peer Lord Archer.

The main secondary school in the town is Court Fields Community School. The school is a technology college. A new state-of-the-art sports is being developed here, and is said to be completed in early 2008.

In spite of its small size, Wellington has historically been notable for its profusion of [[churches]] of many different denominations, including a [[Quaker]] meeting house. It also boasts its own weekly newspaper, the [[Wellington Weekly News]], in which a recent winter headline proclaimed "Tree falls in road".

Wellington has its own amateur dramatic group called Wellington Arts Association, which holds productions both at Wellington Arts Centre and at the Wellesley Theatre (the cinema and theatre in the town).

Wellington was home of [[Fox, Fowler and Company]], which was the last commercial bank permitted to print [[pound sterling|sterling]] [[banknotes]] in [[England and Wales]].

The town is twinned to the town of [[Immenstadt]] in [[Germany]], the town of [[Lillebonne]] in [[France]] and [[Torres Vedras]] in [[Portugal]]{{ref|Twinning}}.
