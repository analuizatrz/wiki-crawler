Affectionately nicknamed "La Binoche" by the French press, Binoche is well known worldwide for her roles in popular, award-winning films such as ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996) and ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]'' (2000) as well as internationally successful arthouse films including ''[[Three Colors: Blue]]'' (1993) and ''[[Caché (film)|Caché]]'' (2005).

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Binoche was born in [[Paris]], the daughter of Jean-Marie Binoche, a director, actor, and sculptor, and Monique Stalens, a teacher, director, and actress.<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/9/Juliette-Binoche.html</ref> Binoche's mother is of Polish descent, and her maternal grandparents were imprisoned at [[Auschwitz]] because they were [[intellectual]]s.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/01/sm_juliettebinoche01.xml&page=2</ref><ref>http://www.petey.com/kk/docs/binousa.txt</ref> Binoche also has French, Flemish, [[Brazil]]ian and Moroccan ancestry.<ref>http://living.scotsman.com/film.cfm?id=1443072007</ref><ref>http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117955600.html?nav=actress07</ref> Her parents divorced when she was four and Binoche, with her sister Marion, was sent to a boarding school.<ref name="actors">Stated in interview at ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''</ref>

Binoche began acting in amateur stage productions, and at 17 directed and starred in a student production of the [[Eugène Ionesco]] play, ''[[Le Roi se meurt|Exit the King]]''. The next year, she studied acting at the [[CNSAD|National Conservatory of Dramatic Arts of Paris]] (CNSAD). She found an agent through a friend and joined a theatre troupe in which she toured France, Belgium and Switzerland under the pseudonym of "Juliette Adrienne".

After quiting the CNSAD, she began acting lessons with famed coach [[Vera Gregh]].  Following in her mother's footsteps, she became a stage actress, occasionally taking small parts in French feature films.<ref name="actors"/> Her first screen role was a small part in the 1983 television film ''[[Dorothée, danseuse de corde]]'' by [[Jacques Fensten]], which was followed by a similarly small role in the provincial television film ''[[Fort bloque]]'' by [[Pierrick Guinnard]]. After Binoche secured her first big screen appearance with a small supporting role in [[Pascal Kané]]'s Algeria-themed ''[[Liberty Belle (film)|Liberty Belle]]'', she decided to pursue a career in cinema.

===1984 to 1991===
Binoche's early films saw her firmly established as a French star of some renown.<ref name="actors"/> The recurring themes of these films were of contemporary young women exploring their lives and their sexuality.  Small roles in ''[[Les Nanas]]'' ([984) and ''[[Adieu blaireau]]'' (1985) led to more significant exposure in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Je vous salue, Marie]]'' and [[Jacques Doillon]]'s ''[[La Vie de Famille (film)|La Vie de Famille]]'' which cast her as the teenage stepdaughter of [[Sami Frey]]'s character. This film was to set the theme and tone of the early career.

In 1985, Binoche secured the lead role in [[André Téchiné]]'s ''[[Rendez-vous (film)|Rendez-vous]]''. The film premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that year, winning Best Director. In 1986, Binoche was nominated for her first [[César Award]] for Best Actress for the film. Binoche's next film was a role in ''[[Mon beau-frère a tué ma soeur]]'' by [[Jacques Rouffio]], which was a critical and commercial failure.  Later that year, she starred opposite [[Michel Piccoli]] in [[Léos Carax]]'s ''[[Mauvais Sang (1986 film)|Mauvais Sang]]''. This film, however, was a critical and commercial success, leading to Binoche's second César Award nomination. In August 1986, she portrayed Tereza in [[Philip Kaufman]]'s ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' based on the [[Milan Kundera]] novel. This was Binoche's first [[English language]] role and was a worldwide success with critics and audiences alike.  After this success, Binoche decided to return to France rather than pursue an international career.

In 1988, she filmed the lead in [[Pierre Pradinas]]'s ''[[Un tour de manège]]'', a little-seen French film. Later that year she began work on [[Léos Carax]]'s ''[[Les Amants du Pont-Neuf]]''. The film was beset by problems and took three years to complete. When it was released in 1991, ''The Lovers on the Bridge'' was a critical success. Binoche won a [[European Film Award]] for best actress as well as her third César Award nomination.

===1992 to 2000===
Following the long shoot of ''Les Amants du Pont-Neuf'', Binoche relocated to [[London]] for the 1992 productions of ''[[Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights]]'' and ''[[Damage (film)|Damage]]'', both of which considerably developed her international reputation. For ''Damage'' Binoche received her fourth César Award nomination.  In 1993, she appeared in [[Krzysztof Kieslowski]]'s ''[[Three Colors: Blue]]'' to much critical acclaim. The film premiered at the 1993 [[Venice Film Festival]]. The film also landed Binoche a César Award for Best Actress as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.  Following this success, she took a short sabbatical during which she became mother of a son, Raphael.

In 1995, Binoche appeared in a big-budget adaptation of [[Jean Giono]]'s ''[[The Horseman on the Roof (1995)|The Horseman on the Roof]]'' directed by [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]]. The film was a box-office success around the world and Binoche was again nominated for a César Award for Best Actress. This role as a romantic heroine was to color the direction of many of her roles in the late 1990s.

In 1996, Binoche appeared in ''[[A Couch in New York]]'' by [[Chantal Akerman]]. The film was a flop, but another 1996 film, ''[[The English Patient (1996 movie)|The English Patient]]'', based on the acclaimed novel and directed by [[Anthony Minghella]], was a worldwide hit.  It garnered nine [[Academy Award]]s, including Best Supporting Actress for Binoche.

After this international hit, Binoche returned to France and began work on [[Claude Berri]]'s ''[[Lucie Aubrac]]'' opposite [[Daniel Auteuil]], which was based on a true story.  Binoche was released from the movie six weeks into the shoot, however, over differences with Berri regarding the authenticity of his script. Next she worked again with André Téchiné for ''[[Alice et Martin]]'' (1998) followed in 1999 by ''[[Children of the Century]]'' in which Binoche played the role of 19th-century French writer [[George Sand]].

2000 saw Binoche appear in four successful, but different, roles. Firstly was ''[[La Veuve de Saint-Pierre (2000 film)|La Veuve de Saint-Pierre]]'' by [[Patrice Leconte]] which saw Binoche nominated for a César Award for best actress.  Next she appeared in [[Michael Haneke]]'s ''[[Code Unknown]]'', a film which was made following Binoche's approach to the Austrian director.  Binoche made her Broadway debut in [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]].  Back on screen, Binoche was the heroine of the [[Lasse Hallstrom]] film ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]'' for which she won a [[European Film Award]] for Best Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award and a [[BAFTA]].

Between 1995 and 2000, Binoche was the advertising face of the [[Lancôme]] scent [[Poème]], her image adorning print campaigns and a TV advertising campaign. There were three commercials featuring Binoche for the perfume, including an advert directed by [[Anthony Minghella]] and scored by [[Gabriel Yared]].

===2001 to 2006===
Following the success of ''Chocolat'', Juliette Binoche returned to France for an unlikely role. ''[[Jet Lag (film)|Jet Lag]]'' (2002) opposite [[Jean Reno]] saw Binoche play a ditzy beautician. The film was a box-office hit in France and saw Binoche once again nominated for a César Award for best actress. In 2003, Binoche featured in an Italian TV commercial for the chocolates [[Ferrero Rocher]]. This ad played upon her ''Chocolat'' persona and featured Binoche handing Rochers to people on the streets of Paris. Next Binoche went to [[South Africa]] to film [[John Boorman]]'s ''[[In My Country]]'' (2004) opposite [[Samuel L. Jackson]].

Binoche then teamed up with Michael Haneke again for ''[[Caché (film)|Caché]]'' in [[2005]]. The film was an immediate success, winning best director at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche was nominated for a European Film Award for Best Actress for her role. Binoche's next film was ''[[Bee Season (film)|Bee Season]]'' with [[Richard Gere]].  ''[[Mary 2005 (film)|Mary]]'' (2005) saw Binoche collaborate with [[Abel Ferrara]] for an investigation of modern faith and [[Mary Magdalene]]'s position in the [[Catholic Church]]. The film was an immediate success, winning the Grand Prix at the 2005 Venice Film Festival.

[[2006]] saw Binoche take part in the [[portmanteau]] work ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'' appearing in a section directed by [[Nobuhiro Suwa]]. Binoche appeared at the 2006 [[Venice Film Festival]] to launch ''[[A Few Days in September (film)|A Few Days in September]]'', by [[Santiago Amigorena]]. Later in the month she traveled to the [[Toronto Film Festival]] for the premiere of ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]'', her second film with Anthony Minghella in the director's chair.

===2007 onward===
2007 marks one of Binoche's busiest years. The [[Cannes Film Festival]] saw the premiere of  ''[[Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge]]'' by the Taiwanese director [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]]. The film was well received by international critics and will debut around the world throughout 2007. ''[[Dan in Real Life]]'' was released in October; currently awaiting release are ''[[Paris (film)|Paris]]'' by [[Cédric Klapisch]] and ''[[Désengagement (film)|Désengagement]]'' by [[Amos Gitai]]. As of July 2007 Binoche is busy at work on ''[[L'Heure D'été]]'' by [[Olivier Assayas]]. Following that Binoche will star in ''Certified Copy'' for [[Abbas Kiarostami]] and ''The Other Man'' for [[Richard Eyre]] opposite [[Liam Neeson]]. In the July 2007 issue of [[Cahiers du Cinema]] Binoche mentioned that she would be auditioning for the [[Rob Marshall]] musical ''Nine'', currently in pre-production.

==Personal life==
Binoche has two children: Raphaël (born on [[September 2]], [[1993]]), whose father is André Halle, a professional scuba diver, and Hana ([[December 16]], [[1999]]), whose father is fellow French actor [[Benoît Magimel]], with whom Binoche starred in the 1999 film ''[[Children of the Century]]''. Binoche is currently romantically involved with Argentine writer/director [[Santiago Amigorena]].

Binoche posed nude for the November 2007 issue of the French edition of [[Playboy]] magazine.

===Painting===
In the 1991 film ''[[Les Amants du Pont-Neuf]]'', in which Binoche portrays an artist, the paintings used in the film were Binoche's own work. She also designed the poster for the film.

Binoche exhibited work done in collaboration with the French designer and artist [[Christian Fenouillat]] in 1993. They plan to collaborate again in the future and are currently working on pieces themed by Cinema.<ref>[http://www.mariinsky.ru/en/opera/fenouillat Mariinsky Theatre biography for Christian Fenouillat]</ref>

===Charities===
Binoche is involved with a number of charities, including  being a patron of the [[Cambodia]]n charity Aspecta since 1992. She is also godmother to nine Cambodian orphans.

In 2004 Binoche organised an auction for [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] in which disposable cameras were given to numerous celebrities and then auctioned off; the winner of each camera would then develop the pictures to reveal that celebrity's chosen subject.
