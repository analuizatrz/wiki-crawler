</ref><ref> [http://www.mythsoc.org/awards/ Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children’s Literature]</ref> written by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in the tradition of the [[fairy tale]]. It was first published on [[September 21]], [[1937]]. While it also stands in its own right, it is often seen as a prelude to Tolkien's monumental [[fantasy]] [[novel]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (published in 1954 and 1955) and a small part in the history of [[Middle-earth]] in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

== Writing the Book == 
In a [[1955]] letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects in the late 1920s, when he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], he began ''The Hobbit'' when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found one blank piece of paper. Suddenly inspired he wrote the words "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Thrór|Thror's]] map, outlining the geography of the tale. It was eventually published when a family friend named Elaine Griffiths was shown a typescript of the story in the early 1930s. When she later went to work for George Allen & Unwin, she revealed the existence of the story to a staffmember named Susan Dagnall, who in turn asked Tolkien if she could look at the (still incomplete) manuscript. He complied and Ms. Dagnall, impressed by it, urged him to complete the book. Once this was done in late 1936, she then showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by [[Allen & Unwin]].

Tolkien introduced or mentioned characters and places that figured prominently in his [[legendarium]], specifically [[Elrond]] and [[Gondolin]], along with elements from Germanic legend. But the decision that the events of ''The Hobbit'' could belong to the same universe as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was made only after publication, when the publisher asked for a sequel and Tolkien began work on what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

The novel draws on Tolkien's knowledge of historical languages and early European texts — many names and words derived from [[Norse mythology]], it makes use of [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[rune]]s, and is filled with information on calendars and moon phases, detailed geographical descriptions that fit well with the accompanying maps — attention to detail that would also be seen in Tolkien's later work.


==Plot==
Chapter I opens as the wizard Gandalf visits the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and invites him to join in an adventure. Bilbo declines, reluctant to leave the safety and comfort of his hobbit-hole. The next day, he is visited by dwarves who believe Bilbo can be of use to them in their journey to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim their ancestral treasure, now in the possession of Smaug the dragon. Bilbo realizes that Gandalf had represented him to the dwarves as a burglar. He reluctantly agrees to go, but he changes his mind the next morning. Gandalf urges him to join them, however, and they depart—a band of fourteen.

Chapters II through X depict Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves travelling out of the hobbit-lands toward the Lonely Mountain far to the east. As the landscape becomes less hospitable and the group faces hunger, bad weather, and attacks from hostile creatures, Bilbo often thinks fondly of home and questions his decision to come on this journey. In the Lone-lands, the travellers encounter trolls who capture the dwarves and tie them up in sacks, planning to roast and eat them later. They are rescued by Gandalf and Bilbo, who produces a key he found nearby. The key unlocks the trolls’ secret cave, where the travellers find gold and weapons, to which they help themselves. They travel on to the valley of Rivendell at the edge of the Wild, and stay at the home of Elrond, a hospitable elf leader. Elrond translates the runes on the swords that Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield, king of the dwarves, took from the trolls’ cave; they are ancient swords called Orcrist and Glamdring that come from dragon plunder or the Goblin-wars. Elrond also translates Thorin’s map, which clarifies the importance of Durin’s Day, the first day of the dwarves’ New Year. After two weeks, Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves resume their journey. Approaching the Misty Mountains, they take shelter from a storm in a cave that turns out to be the Great Goblin’s cavern. The Goblins capture Bilbo and his companions and take their ponies. Using Glamdring, Gandalf kills the Great Goblin and frees Bilbo and the dwarves. The travellers try to find their way out of the cave as the Goblins retreat, but Bilbo falls on his way out and loses consciousness.

When Bilbo regains consciousness and tries to make his way out of the cave, he finds a ring that he absentmindedly pockets. This incident, in Chapter V, marks a dramatic moment in his adventures, for the ring confers powers of invisibility on whomever wears it. Bilbo encounters old Gollum, a slimy, murderous creature who kills and eats Goblins and others who stray into the cave. They exchange riddles, and Gollum discovers that Bilbo has the ring, which is Gollum’s favourite possession. At the same time, Bilbo puts on the ring and discovers its magical power. Pursuing the invisible Bilbo, Gollum inadvertently shows him the way out of the cave. Bilbo has the opportunity to kill Gollum, but decides his invisibility is an unfair advantage and, instead, leaps over his head through the mouth of the cave.

After he is outside, Bilbo plans to go back and rescue his friends but finds they have escaped, too. He tells his tale and gains their respect. Then they all run away from the Mountains, fearful of the Goblins. They are chased up into trees by Wargs, menacing wild wolves. Gandalf chases the Wargs away, but the Wargs soon return with Goblins and try to smoke Bilbo and the dwarves out of the trees by setting fire to the forest. Bilbo and the dwarves are rescued by eagles, who fly them to their nest. After spending the night in safety, they resume their travels east and Gandalf takes them to the house of Beorn, the skin-changer, who outfits them for the next leg of their journey, through the forest of Mirkwood. At the end of Chapter VII, Gandalf leaves them at the edge of Mirkwood, warning them not to stray from the path. Gandalf does not reappear until the Battle of Five Armies near the end of the book.

Bilbo and the dwarves travel through the forest and use a boat to cross an enchanted lake. They rescue Bombur, one of the thirteen dwarves, from a fall into the lake. Hungry, they approach a party of feasting elves, but to no avail. Bilbo is captured by a spider, but fights his way free with the sword he took from the trolls; he names it Sting. Wearing the ring of invisibility, he frees the dwarves who have been bound in spiders’ webs and reveals to them the secret of the ring. At the end of Chapter VIII, Bilbo and the dwarves find that Thorin has been captured by elves, and in Chapter IX, all the dwarves are captured and thrown into the dungeon under the palace of the Elvenking. Bilbo escapes this fate because he is wearing the ring that makes him invisible, and he wanders around the Elvenking’s palace until he has developed a plan to free the dwarves. He hides them in empty wine barrels that are dropped through the floor of the palace and float down the river to Esgaroth or Lake-town. Bilbo and the dwarves spend some time in Lake-town, a town of men, but then move on and disembark near the Lonely Mountain.

Chapter XI depicts the encounter with Smaug the dragon, the object of the journey. The travellers can see the door to Smaug’s lair in the side of the Lonely Mountain, but they can’t open it until Bilbo suddenly understands the clues in Thorin’s map. On Durin’s Day, using the key from Thorin’s grandfather, Bilbo enters the Lonely Mountain. He sees Smaug the dragon sitting on the treasure hoard and, despite great fear, engages him in conversation and emerges with a cup he has stolen from the hoard. At this point, Bilbo becomes, in effect, the leader of the group. He re-enters Smaug’s lair and steals the Arkenstone, the precious gem of the hoard. In a vengeful rage, Smaug comes out of his lair and destroys the town of Esgaroth. Bard, a Lake-town archer, kills Smaug.

At this point, in Chapter XIV, various groups begin to converge on the Lonely Mountain, because the treasure Smaug had guarded is now up for grabs. Thorin refuses to ally with Bard or the elves, and Bilbo gives Bard the Arkenstone to use in bargaining with Thorin. Gandalf reappears. The Battle of Five Armies ensues—dwarves, men, and elves fighting against Goblins and Wargs. After the battle, Bilbo is taken to see Thorin, who is dying. He is buried with Orcrist and the Arkenstone; his inheritance, the hoard, is divided. Bilbo leaves with Gandalf, Elvenking, and Beorn to go back to the hobbit-lands. They stay with Beorn over Yule-tide and return to Elrond in the spring. When Bilbo arrives home, he finds that his house and its contents are being auctioned, because he is presumed dead. He recovers most of his possessions and leads an eccentric life, sometimes visited by his travel companions.

== Joining ''The Hobbit'' to ''The Lord of the Rings'' ==
In the first edition, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle game. During the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'' Tolkien saw the need to revise this passage, in order to reflect his new concept of the [[One Ring]] and its powerful hold on Gollum. Tolkien tried many different passages in the chapter that would become chapter 2 of ''The Lord of the Rings'', "The Shadow of the Past". Eventually Tolkien decided a rewrite of ''The Hobbit'' was in order, and he sent a sample chapter of this rewrite ("Riddles in the Dark") to his publishers. Initially he heard nothing further, but when he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition he learned to his surprise the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding.

In the introduction of ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as inside "The Shadow of the Past", the differences of the first edition are explained as a "lie" that Bilbo made up because of the One Ring's influence on him, and which he originally wrote down in his book. Inside ''The Lord of the Rings'', Bilbo finally confesses the true story at the Council of [[Elrond]], although Gandalf had deduced the truth earlier. As Tolkien presented himself as the translator of the supposedly historic ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'', where Bilbo and Frodo's stories were recorded, he further explained the two differing stories in ''The Hobbit'' by stating he had originally used Bilbo's original story, but later retranslated the work with the "true story" recorded by Frodo.

This first edition also uses the word "[[gnome]]", which Tolkien in his earlier writing had used to refer to the second kindred of the [[High Elves]] – the [[Noldor]] (or "Deep Elves"). Tolkien thought that "gnome", being derived from the Greek ''gnosis'' (knowledge), was a good name for the Noldor he created to be the wisest of the other Elves. But with its English connotations of a small, secretive, and unattractive creature (see [[garden gnome]]) Tolkien removed it from later editions.

He made other minor changes in order to conform the narrative to events in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in the ideas he was continually developing for the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''.

=== Differences and inconsistencies ===
{{OR}}
When finally revised, ''The Hobbit'' still has many differences from ''The Lord of the Rings''. Examples include the following:

* Matches are only featured in ''The Hobbit''. Flints are used in ''The Lord of the Rings''
* The trolls have English first names (Tom, Bert and Bill), and Bill has the English last name Huggins.
* The elves in Rivendell appear very happy, active and playful, contrasting highly with their noble, sombre portrayal in the rest of the Legendarium.
* There is lighthearted use of "magic"; Gandalf is said to have given the [[Old Took]] a pair of diamond studs that "fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered", and when Bilbo tries to steal a purse from the trolls, the purse shouts. Magic is not used so in ''The Lord of the Rings'', and is more often an enhancement or corruption of natural phenomena.
* The narrative style features many asides where the narrator addresses the reader directly.
* The hobbits' "[[pipe-weed]]" which is also featured in ''The Lord of the Rings'' is explicitly referred to as "tobacco".
* Orcs are called Goblins in ''The Hobbit'', but more often referred to as Orcs in ''The Lord of the Rings'' (particularly when the speaker is not a Hobbit).

Many of these inconsistencies occur because Tolkien originally wrote the book as a children's story separate from (but connected to) his mythological work,<ref name="carpenter-tolkien">{{cite book | last = Carpenter | first = Humphrey | authorlink = Humphrey Carpenter | title = J. R. R.

As told in "[[The Quest of Erebor]]" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Tolkien later had Gandalf say that Bilbo's account would have been very different, if ''he'' had written it instead.<ref name="unfinished-tales">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J.

== Publications of early drafts ==

In May and June 2007, HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin published in two parts ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]''.  Much like ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', ''The History of The Hobbit'' examines previously unpublished original drafts of ''The Hobbit'' with extensive commentary by John Rateliff.

== Editions ==
[[Image:Hobbit cover.JPG|right|200px|thumb|200px|Dustcover of the first edition of ''The Hobbit''. This cover was designed by Tolkien himself, as was the binding illustrated at the top of this article.]]
George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' in September 1937. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien himself. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by December due to enthusiastic reviews. Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York prepared an American edition to be released early in 1938 in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937. Despite the book's popularity, wartime conditions forced the London publisher to print small runs of the remaining two printings of the first edition.

As remarked above, Tolkien substantially revised ''The Hobbit'''s text describing Bilbo's dealings with Gollum in order to blend the story better into what ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had become. This revision became the second edition, published in 1951 in both UK and American editions. Slight corrections to the text have appeared in the third (1966) and fourth editions (1978).

New [[English-language editions of The Hobbit|English-language editions of ''The Hobbit'']] spring up often, despite the book's age, with at least fifty editions having been published to date. Each comes from a different publisher or bears distinctive cover art, internal art, or substantial changes in format. The text of each generally adheres to the Allen & Unwin edition extant at the time it is published.

The remarkable and enduring popularity of ''The Hobbit'' expresses itself in the collectors' market. The first printing of the first English language edition rarely sells for under $10,000 US dollars in any whole condition, and clean copies in original dust jackets signed by the author are routinely advertised for over $100,000. Online auction site [[eBay]] tends to define the market value for those who [[Early American editions of The Hobbit|collect ''The Hobbit'']].

== Adaptations ==
Over the years, ''The Hobbit'' has been adapted for other media multiple times.

===TV===
{{main|The Hobbit (film)}}
''[[The Hobbit (film)|The Hobbit]]'', an [[animated]] version of the story, produced by [[Rankin/Bass]], debuted as a [[television movie]] in the [[United States]] in 1977.

The BBC children's television series ''[[Jackanory]]'' presented an adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' in 1979.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Hobbit | series = Jackanory | serieslink = Jackanory}} [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0771799/ Internet Movie Database: ''Jackanory'', "The Hobbit" (1979)]</ref> Unusually for the programme, the adaptation had multiple storytellers.

===Film===
[[Peter Jackson]] and his wife [[Fran Walsh]] expressed interest in 1995 in adapting [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels. Jackson's pitch was to film ''The Hobbit'', and shoot ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' back-to-back afterward. They met with [[Saul Zaentz]], who bought the film rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' from [[MGM]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Brian Sibley]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher = Harpercollins | date = 2006 | location = London | pages = 313-116 | id = ISBN 0-00-717558-2}}</ref> However, frustration arose when Jackson's producer, [[Harvey Weinstein]] learnt Zaentz had production rights to ''The Hobbit'', but distribution rights still belonged to [[United Artists]]. U.A. was on the market, so Weinstein's attempts to buy those rights were unsuccessful.

Eight years later, [[New Line Cinema]] had produced [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] after [[Miramax Films]] left when they wanted to condense the two planned ''Rings'' films into one.<ref>{{cite DVD-notes | title = The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring: Special Extended Edition | titlelink= The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film) | director = [[Peter Jackson]] | format = From Book to Script (documentary) | publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | year = 2002}}</ref> However, New Line has a limited time option on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=limitedtime>{{cite news | author = Nicole LaPorte |url = http://movies.go.com/variety/feature?featureid=861521 |title = Inside Move: It's hard to be a 'Hobbit' |publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=  |accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> MGM holds the distribution rights to ''The Hobbit'', and expressed interest in teaming up with New Line and Jackson to make the film in September 2006.<ref>{{cite news | author = Stax | title = MGM Eyes Hobbit, T4 | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2006-09-11]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/732/732006p1.html | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> MGM also expressed interest in another prequel film, set between ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Hobbit, Crown, Panther News | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2006-11-14]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/746/746019p1.html | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>

In March 2005, Jackson launched a lawsuit against New Line, claiming he had lost revenue from merchandising, video and computer games releases associated with ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of The Ring]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Director sues over Rings profits | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = [[2005-03-02]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4312463.stm | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> New Line co-founder [[Robert Shaye]] was annoyed with the lawsuit, and said in January 2007 that Jackson would never again direct a film for New Line, accusing Jackson of being greedy.<ref>{{cite news | title = Jackson ruled out of Hobbit film | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = [[2007-08-17]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6251099.stm | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> MGM was disappointed with New Line's decision.<ref name=limitedtime/> [[Sam Raimi]] expressed interest in taking over the project.<ref>{{cite news | author=Adam Markovitz | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035161,00.html | title='Hobbit' Forming? | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=[[2007-04-16]] | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> In August 2007, after a string of flops, Shaye was trying to repair his working relationship with Jackson.

== Influences on other works==
<!-- [[Middle-earth]] has been featured in songs notably by [[Enya]] and the [[Brobdingnagian Bards]]. _Middle-earth in general or specifically The Hobbit? We need to distinguish. For more general works, there's "Works inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien". --> 

* [[Led Zeppelin]]'s song "[[Misty Mountain Hop]]" contains references to ''The Hobbit'', whilst other songs are thought to be influenced by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
* "[[The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins]]", performed by [[Leonard Nimoy]] as part of his 1968 ''Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy'' album, is the most pertinent because it recounts the book's storyline in its two minutes. The ballad's [[music video]] became a minor [[list of Internet phenomena|Internet phenomenon]] in the early 2000s when ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy was released.
* Another well-known reference is [[Blind Guardian]]'s [[Somewhere Far Beyond|The Bard's Song: The Hobbit]].
* A [[Trance music|trance]] track was released in 1995 by [[Dynamix Maniax]], featuring the title "Calling Middle-earth", containing a muffled sample from the 1977 [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated version of ''The Hobbit'']].
* The Canadian rock trio [[Rush (band)|Rush]] memorializes the elven refuge of [[Rivendell]] in a song of the same name on their 1975 album ''[[Fly by Night (album)|Fly by Night]]''.
* In the episode of ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'' "[[Journey to the Center of Nowhere]]", Courage's master Muriel is held captive by three large [[eggplant]] monsters that roughly resemble trolls. The eggplants argue amongst themselves over how to cook Muriel, whether they should fry her, grill her, bake her, or sit on her until she becomes jelly, a scene taken directly from ''The Hobbit''.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

<!--Hiding this part for now; we need to filter the Hobbit-inspired stuff from the LOTR-inspired stuff. They're not the same. Nightfall in Middle-earth is about The Silmarillion! Sheesh...
