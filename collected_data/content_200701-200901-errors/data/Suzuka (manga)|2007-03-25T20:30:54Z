== Overview ==
Suzuka was written by Kouji Seo, and featured in the Weekly Shōnen Magazine and published by Kodansha since [[3 March]] [[2004]].  As of March 2007 15 volumes have been released and the series is still ongoing.  Suzuka can be mistaken as a [[Love Hina]] ripoff because of similarities, including a girls' dormitory run by an aunt.  Suzuka differs from Love Hina in story plot, especially after chapter two when the story becomes unique and plays out Yamato and his friends' lives.  

An anime version was released on [[July 6]] [[2005]] by [[Studio Comet]] under director [[Hiroshi Fukutomi]], and was shown weekly on [[TV Tokyo]].  The series ends with 26 episodes, which coincides with Volume 9, Chapter 72 of the manga. The anime utilized original openings by COACH, and [[Background music|BGM]] by Takumi Masanori.  The Suzuka anime series follows the manga closely, without fillers nor randomness.  

The story constantly shifts back and forth between two themes: romance and sports.  When sports is the main topic, the viewer can recognize the change, because the music becomes more energetic, and the atmosphere is filled with determination.  Yamato tends to have a much more serious demeanor while in this mode, so too does Suzuka.  When the anime shifts to the topic of romance, the perverted friend of Yamato, Yasunobu, shows up often, offering comical relief as well as contributing to the comedic aspects of the series.  Fights between Yasunobu and Miki also soften the moment, as well as making the setting much more lively.  Another theme shown includes school life and dormitory life, which are comical since other characters are introduced, including two troublesome college girls who build on top of the ecchi-ness started by Yasunobu.  

While the plot of the story moves very quickly, rarely pausing to fill up space, the characters are carefully developed, and things such as sensitivity is carefully planned, and reactions from girls carefully thought out. Every single character grows and matures in thought throughout the story, but Yamato's carelessness can never be replaced.

== Plot ==
The plot is based on a young man, Yamato Akitsuki, who moves from his rural home in [[Hiroshima]] [[prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] to live at his aunt's apartment building/indoor bath complex in [[Tokyo]] and attend the local athletics-oriented [[high school]].  Before arriving at his new home he walks past his new school and sees a young girl practicing [[high jump]] at the track field. 

He falls in [[love]] with her at first sight and does not expect to see her again.  He soon discovers that she is Suzuka Asahina, one of the occupants of his aunt's apartment.  Because of Suzuka, Yamato discovers that he has the potential to become an impressive track star and joins the team in hopes of impressing her.  Suzuka is rather ambivalent with her feelings and wavers from liking him and disliking him.

The story is based around these two main characters and their friends.

== Characters ==
The ''Suzuka'' series offers many unique and likeable characters, all who have different personalities, ranging from the serious Suzuka to the perverted Yashunobu, from the somewhat-crazy Yuuka to the completely crazy Megumi, ''Suzuka's'' Dr. Hyde. <br>

== Anime ==
The anime version features the voice talents of many new actors. There are 26 episodes released by Studio Comet, and runs a plot almost identical to the manga, except for some obvious, required changes like the constant nude shots in the manga.  Likewise,while the manga Yasunobu thought he was being successful, the anime Yasunobu was able to understand his feelings.  This accepting Yasunobu was portrayed more often in the anime, whereas in the manga, he usually gives perverted tips, although he is generally understanding.  Another aspect left out were the many conversations that occurred in the baths, which were only shown in the manga. In addition, for probably a similar reason, the hole connecting Yamato's room with Suzuka's room was left out.
