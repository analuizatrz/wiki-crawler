'''Bradford "Brad" Rutter''' (born [[January 31]], [[1978]]) is best known as a contestant on the U.S. [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[game show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. Rutter became an undefeated five-time champion on ''Jeopardy!'' in 2000 and subsequently won an unprecedented three ''Jeopardy!'' tournament titles: the 2001 [[Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions|Tournament of Champions]], the [[Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters|Million Dollar Masters Tournament]], and the [[Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions|Ultimate Tournament of Champions]]. Following his third tournament win, in which he defeated [[Ken Jennings]] and [[Jerome Vered]] in the finals, Rutter surpassed Jennings as the [[American_game_show_winnings_records#All_Time_Winnings_List|highest money-winner ever on American game shows]]. Jennings subsequently regained his record by appearing on various other game shows, culminating in an appearance on ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (U.S. game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' (first aired on [[October 10]], [[2008]]). Rutter retained the record for ''Jeopardy!'' winnings with either $3,255,102 or $3,270,102, and a pair of [[Chevrolet Camaro]]s ($55,102 in five-day winnings, $100,000 and $1,000,000 and either $2,100,000 or $2,115,000 (see below) in his three tournaments respectively).

In twenty games, Rutter has never lost a match of ''Jeopardy!'', having twice trailed at the end of the first game of a two-day match before coming back to win the match in the second game &mdash; against Rick Knutsen in the finals of the 2001 Tournament of Champions, and against John Cuthbertson in the semifinals of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions.

==Winnings dispute==
There is a discrepancy between sources as to Rutter's total ''Jeopardy!'' winnings stemming from the prize structure of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions. Different cash prize amounts were awarded to players for finishing first, second and third in each game, with different amounts for each round of the tournament. Those who won the first round earned $15,000; second round winners earned $20,000; third round winners earned $30,000; fourth round winners earned $50,000; and Rutter earned an additional $2,000,000 for winning the tournament. Rutter was among nine top winners who received a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] to the second round (Ken Jennings was the only player to receive a bye to the finals). It is disputed whether these "Nifty Nine" players received $15,000 for their first-round byes. Different sources cite Rutter's tournament winnings as $2,100,000 or $2,115,000, resulting in a winnings total of either $3,255,102 or $3,270,102, depending on whether the $15,000 is included.

==Life outside ''Jeopardy!''==
Until 2007, Rutter lived in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], where he hosted ''[http://www.inquizitive.com/ InQuizitive]'', a locally broadcast quiz show for [[high school]] students.  He has also been a reader and judge for the high school [[National Academic Championship]].

Rutter is a 1995 graduate of Manheim Township High School in [[Neffsville, Pennsylvania]], where he was on the [[Quiz Bowl]] team.  He is one of the 18 people to have been named to the [[National Academic Championship]] Hall of Fame in its 25-year history.  At the 2005 Manheim Township High School graduation ceremony, he announced the start of a scholarship fund in memory of his late high-school quiz bowl coach.  

Rutter has described himself as a "slacker" in high school and a [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] dropout (while there, he studied [[English studies|English]] and [[History]]).  Before his success on ''Jeopardy!'', he worked at the [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] [[Trans World Entertainment|Coconuts record store]].  

===Other game show appearances===
He appeared on the U.S. game show ''[[1 vs. 100]]'' (as a member of "the Mob") on December 1, 2006 and again on December 8, 2006. He answered every question correctly and was one of only seven mob members to survive to the next show, as was [[Annie Duke]]. He would eventually be eliminated on the December 15th episode, on a question about Jewish reggae musician [[Matisyahu]]. He again appeared on February 9, 2007 and was eliminated late into a winner-takes-$250,000 "last man standing" competition, but before Ken Jennings. Rutter was the top seed in ''[[Grand Slam (US TV series)|Grand Slam]]'', but lost in the second round to [[Ogi Ogas]], a former ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' contestant.
