'''''The Oprah Winfrey Show''''' (also known as '''''Oprah''''') is an [[United States|American]] nationally [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]], hosted and produced by its namesake [[Oprah Winfrey]], and is the highest-rated talk show in American television history.<ref>[http://www.kingworld.com/release/oprah_winfrey.html King World press release] Retrieved [[July 34]], [[2006]]</ref>

It is currently the longest-running [[daytime television]] talk show in the [[United States]], having run since [[September 8]], [[1986]], for over 22 seasons and 3,000 episodes (as of [[September 10]], [[2007]]). The show is renewed through 2011 but in a 2007 interview with [[Larry King]], Oprah said that in 2011 she will not renew her contract, and thus end the show for good.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

'''''Oprah''''' has been included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's shortlist of the best television series of the twentieth century in 1998, and it made the top 50 of ''[[TV Guide]]'''s countdown of the greatest shows of all time<ref>[http://www.ez-entertainment.net/features/tvguide50.htm Top 50 Greatest Shows Of All Time]</ref> in 2002. 

The show is highly influential, especially with [[women]], and many of its topics penetrate into American pop-cultural consciousness. While early episodes of the show followed a [[Phil Donahue]]-style exploration of sensationalistic social issues, Oprah eventually transformed her series into a more positive, spiritually uplifting experience marked by [[Book discussion club|book clubs]], [[celebrity]] interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events. 
   
==Wildest Dreams==
One of the show's features in recent years has been the "Wildest Dreams" tour, which fulfills the dreams of people reported to her by producers, found mostly from viewers who write in to the show, be the dream a new house, an encounter with a favorite performer, or a guest role on a popular TV show.

During her nineteenth season premiere (fall 2004), Oprah surprised her entire [[audience]] by giving them each a [[Pontiac G6]]. It was named as one of the greatest television moments in history by ''[[TV Guide]]''. Although Oprah may be given credit for giving the cars away, they were donated to her by [[Pontiac]] as a [[publicity stunt]]. In 2005, [[Tina Turner]] guest starred, allowing ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' star [[Felicity Huffman]] to fulfill her Wildest Dream of singing backup to Turner. Another included a man named David Caruso who lost 300 pounds after weighing 525 pounds. He came on the show in 2003 and told Oprah that one of his wishes was to sit in a [[Porsche]]. Minutes later, a white 2004 Porsche Boxster S (worth about $63,000) was given to him. Oprah named this one of her 20 favorite moments on a special DVD set.

==Interviews==
Winfrey has interviewed a plethora of [[political]] and public figures during the past twenty years. In the earlier seasons of the show, rather than offering a simple publicity platform, a celebrity would often feature after a period of intense media scrutiny, such was the case when the model [[Naomi Campbell]] appeared after there were claims she had a substance abuse problem. She often interviews celebrities on issues that directly involve them in some way, such as cancer or charity work.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Winfrey claims her worst interviewing experience was with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in the fourth season. The actress refused to talk about her marriages and current relationship, leading to a number of awkward silences. Taylor later apologized and returned in a better frame of mind a year later.

In [[December]] [[2003]], [[AJ McLean]] appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show where he talked for the first time in public about his addiction to alcohol and drugs, and his struggles rising to fame. The rest of the band surprised him by arriving in person to give him support, marking the first time the [[Backstreet Boys]] had appeared together in public in almost two years. The band began to reform and reconcile their differences to start recording a comeback album.
[[Image:Cruiseonoprah.jpg|200px|thumb|Tom Cruise jumps ecstatically on [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]]'s couch]]
Oprah's interview with [[Tom Cruise]], which was broadcast on [[May 23]], [[2005]], has also gained notoriety. Cruise — according to the ''[[The New York Times]]'' — "jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell rapturously to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend." This scene quickly became part of American pop-cultural discourse and was heavily parodied in media as diverse as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and the film ''[[Scary Movie 4]]''.

Non-celebrity guests are generally individuals who have been involved in an extraordinary situation. Examples of these include an episode in the fourth season which featured [[Truddi Chase]], a woman with [[Multiple Personality Disorder]] who reported being violently and sexually abused beginning at the age of two. After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book ''When Rabbit Howls'', Oprah unexpectedly broke down in tears whilst reading the teleprompter, relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming. Other non-celebrity appearances include guests who are chosen for being particularly un-fashionable and are given a fashion makeover by renowned style advisors [[Trinny Woodall]] and [[Susannah Constantine]].<blockquote>

==Regular segments==
;[[Oprah's Book Club]]
:Originally featured a monthly [[book]] highlight, including [[author]] interviews. Its popularity caused featured books to shoot to the top of bestseller lists, often increasing sales by as many as a million copies at its peak. It was suspended in 2002 and returned in 2003, now featuring more [[classic]] works of literature, with reduced selections per season. The old format was reintroduced in September 2005, but her selection of [[James Frey]]'s ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' became controversial due to accusations of falsification. January 2006 saw [[Elie Wiesel]]'s [[Night (book)|Night]] selected; Oprah even traveled to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] with Mr. Wiesel. The most recent selection is A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle.  
 
;What's The Buzz
:Oprah introduces up-and-coming public figures generating industry buzz but not otherwise widely known. In what several media commentators have labelled ''The Oprah Effect'', people appearing on this segment such as Oscar-winner [[Jamie Foxx]] and singer [[James Blunt]] have benefited from the extra publicity the show brings. Blunt in particular saw album sales increase dramatically and a top two spot on the Billboard 200.

;Remember Your Spirit house of payne...
:Premiering and most popular during the mid-1990s, recurring guest and self described spiritualist [[Iyanla Vanzant]] emphasized the importance of self-affirmation and intrinsic worth.

;[[Oprah's Favorite Things]]
: Usually airs during the holiday shopping season or at the beginning of spring. Items personally favored by Winfrey are given away to the audience. Certain episodes of this type feature select groups of people; in 2005's Christmas edition [[Hurricane Katrina]] volunteer workers appeared in the audience; in November 2006 opting to hand out credit cards of one-thousand dollars and camcorders to members of her studio audience. who were then told to help others creatively using the money, in what Oprah has since called her favorite giveaway ever.

;Tuesdays With Dr. Phil
:In 1996 Oprah Winfrey hired "Relationship and Life Strategy Expert" [[Dr. Phil McGraw]] to prepare her for her trial in [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], [[Texas]] in which she was accused of intentionally defaming the U.S. beef industry. Winfrey credited him for her victory in that case and soon after, he made weekly appearances on her show, tackling human issue topics such as weight loss, financial planning and [[errant]] children. One episode saw a grieving woman who could not overcome the death of her daughter and revealed that she had planned to kill herself after the show. 

:Dr. Phil's Tuesday slots, with running commentary from Oprah herself, quickly became a popular feature and in 2002 he was given his own syndicated daily TV show, produced by Winfrey's Harpo Studios and ending the segments.

== Criticism ==

The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] received a proliferation of complaints from angry parents whose children watched the show in an early-evening slot in many television markets.
