[[Image:Briana Loves Jenna.jpg|left|thumb|Cover of ''Briana Loves Jenna'' (2001), first Club Jenna produced film, best selling and best renting title of its year, starring Jameson and [[Briana Banks]].]]

Jameson and Grdina formed [[Club Jenna]] as an [[Internet pornography]] company in 2000. ClubJenna.com was one of the first pornographic sites to provide more than pictures and videos; it provided explicit diaries, relationship advice, and even stock tips to paid members. The site was profitable in its third week. The business later diversified into multi-media pornographic entertainment, first by administering other porn stars' web sites, then, in 2001, by production of pornographic films.<ref name=Forbes/> 

Early Club Jenna films starred Jameson herself, limiting herself to on-screen sex with other women or with Grdina, who appeared as [[Justin Sterling]]. The first ClubJenna film, ''Briana Loves Jenna'' (2001), co-produced with Vivid, cost [[United States dollar|US$]]280,000 to make, and grossed over $1 million in its first year. It was the best selling and best renting pornographic title of its year, winning twin [[AVN Awards 2003|AVN Awards]].<ref name=Forbes/><ref name=JJJBio>[http://justjennajameson.com/bio.html JustJennaJameson.com bio] official fan site biography.
