The '''University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg''' is a leading [[South African]] [[university]] situated in the northern areas of central [[Johannesburg]].  It is more commonly known as '''Wits University'''. The university has its roots in the mining industry, as does Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand in general.

In 1959, the ''Extension of University Education Act'' forced restricted registrations of black students for most of the [[apartheid]] era; despite this, several notable black leaders graduated from the university. It became desegregated once again prior to the abolition of apartheid in 1990. Several of apartheid's staunchest critics, both white and black, were one-time students and graduates of the university.

== History ==
[[Image:The Wits University Great Hall.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Great Hall is on the east campus. It is where [[graduation|graduation ceremonies]], ceremonial lectures, concerts and other functions are held.]]

The university was founded as a school in [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] in 1896 as the "South African School of Mines".  Eight years later, in 1904 the school moved to [[Johannesburg]] and changed its name to the "Transvaal Technical Institute".  The school changed its name in 1906 to the "Transvaal University College" and in 1910, the school again changed its name to the "South African School of Mines and Technology".  Finally, in 1922, the school was granted full university status after incorporating the College as the "University of the Witwatersrand".  The area of Milner Park, north-west of Braamfontein was identified as the location for the new university [[campus]], and construction began in the same year.  There were to be six faculties that offered degrees at the University: arts, science, medicine, engineering, law, and commerce.

The school experienced significant growth after its incorporation as a university, growing from a mere 6,275 students in 1963 to over 16,400 in 1985.  In 1964, the Medical Library of the Faculty of Medicine moved to Esselen Street, in the [[Hillbrow]] section of Johannesburg.  During the course of the 1960s, the university opened many new schools and buildings, and acquired a limestone cave renowned for its archaeological material located at [[Sterkfontein]]. The Graduate School of Business was established later in 1968 in [[Parktown]].  

A farm next to Sterkfontein named [[Swartkrans]] rich in archaeological material was purchased in 1968, and excavation rights were obtained for archaeological and palaeontological purposes at Makapansgat, located in [[Limpopo province]].  The next year, the Ernest Oppenheimer Residence opened next to the Business school in Parktown, and later in the same year, clinical departments at the new Medical School opened.  In 1976, Lawson's Corner was renamed University Corner.  Senate House, the university's main administrative building, was completed in 1977.  The university underwent a significant expansion programme in 1984, acquiring the Milner Park showgrounds from the Transvaal Agricultural Society, and renaming it as west campus.  

In 1984, the Chamber of Mines building opened.  A large walkway named the Amic Deck was constructed across the De Villiers Graaff Highway which bisects the campus, linking the east and west campuses. In 2004, the Johannesburg College of Education was incorporated into Wits as an education campus under the national education department plan to reform tertiary education in South Africa.

The University is divided into five academic campuses. The Braamfontein campus (which serves as the main administrative campus) is divided into East and West Campuses by the by the [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1 (De Villiers Graaff Highway]]) and Yale Road. The entire campus is bordered by Empire Road (north), Jan Smuts Avenue (East), Jorrissen Street and Enoch Sontonga Road (south) and Annet Road (west). The historic east campus is primarily the home of the faculties of science and humanities, as well as the University [[Senate]] and administration. The west campus houses both the commerce and engineering faculties. The Main Campus is home to 6 [[Dormitory|residences]], namely Sunnyside and Jubilee Halls (female residences), Men's Res (College and Dalrymple Houses), Barnato Halls, David Webster, West Campus Village and International House.

Off the Braamfontein campus are three academic campuses, all in [[Parktown]]. The Wits Education Campus specialises with education, which is a school within the Faculty of Humanities. The education campus boasts three female residences; namely the Girton, Medhurst and Reith Hall. East of the education campus (across York Road), lies the Medical School which is the administration and academic centre for the health science faculty .

West of the education campus (across Victoria Avenue) lies the Wits Business School. It is the leading and most acclaimed [[business school]] in South Africa. Within the business school's borders are the Ernest Oppenheimer Halls (male residence) and the co-ed Parktown Village I.

There are centres that are not academic although referred to by the University as campuses. These are Graduate Lodge, Campus Lodge, South Court and Braamfontein Centre; all next to the Main Campus in [[Braamfontein]]. Furthermore there is Parktown Village II and Knockando Halls (a male residence) in Parktown, and the Essellen Street residence in [[Hillbrow]].
