'''Troy McClure''' is<!--per [[WP:TENSE]], McClure is and will always remain a fictional character, even though he isn't in the show anymore. He was never alive or real in the first place, therefore will never enter the past tense when written about in the out-of-universe sense.--> a [[fictional character]] in the American [[animation|animated]] sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He was [[voice acting|voiced]] by [[Phil Hartman]], and first appears in the second season episode "[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]".<ref name=first>{{cite video | people=Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike|year=2002|title=The Simpsons The Complete Second Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> McClure is a washed-up actor, usually shown doing low-level work, such as hosting infomercials and educational films. He appears as the central character in "[[A Fish Called Selma]]", in which he marries [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma Bouvier]] to aid his failing career and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also 'hosts' "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]" and "[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]".

McClure was partially based on [[B movie]] actors [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Doug McClure]], as well as Hartman himself. After Hartman's murder in 1998, the character was retired, making his final appearance in the tenth season in "[[Bart the Mother]]". McClure is often cited as one of the series' most popular characters; in 2006 [[IGN]] ranked him first on their list of the "Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters".

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Troy McClure is a stereotypical [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] has-been.<ref name=fcs>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh; Oakley, Bill; Silverman, David; Goldblum, Jeff|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> He was a star in the early 1970s, but his career went downhill due to rumors of a [[paraphilia]] involving [[fish]]. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Vegetarian|episodelink=Lisa the Vegetarian |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David; Kirkland, Mark; Mirkin, David|network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-15 |season=7 |number=133}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Simpson|episodelink=Lisa the Simpson |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Goldreyer, Ned; Dietter, Susie; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Reardon, Jim; Reiss, Mike; Jean, Al|network=Fox |airdate=1998-03-08 |season=9 |number=195}}</ref> and [[infomercial]]s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Marge in Chains|episodelink=Marge in Chains |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-06 |season=4 |number=80}}</ref> McClure introduces himself by saying, "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as...," mentioning two titles that are similar to his current performance. For example, in the episode "[[Bart the Mother]]", McClure introduces a film about birds by saying, "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as ''Earwigs: Eww!'' and ''Man vs. Nature: The Road to Victory''."
 
McClure's most prominent role occurs in the seventh-season episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]". In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with [[Selma Bouvier]], whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]]. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in ''Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!'', a stage musical version of the film ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. To further boost McClure's career, McClure's agent suggests that he marry Selma. Unaware of McClure's motivation, Selma accepts, and moves into McClure's house, a [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] building which resembles the [[Chemosphere]]. At his [[bachelor party]], a drunken McClure tells [[Homer Simpson]] that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing at the wedding, but later mentions McClure's admission to [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but she becomes disturbed when McClure's agent advises the pair have a child (since "all the big parts these days are going to family men"). Having a child will secure McClure's casting as [[List of fictional characters within The Simpsons#McBain|McBain]]'s sidekick in ''McBain IV: Fatal Discharge'', but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship, and decides to leave McClure. As a result, McClure settles for a starring role in the [[20th Century Fox]] film ''The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Fish Called Selma |episodelink=A Fish Called Selma |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Barth, Jack; Kirkland, Mark; Weinstein, Josh; Oakley, Bill|network=Fox |airdate=1996-03-24 |season=7 |number=147}}</ref>

In addition to his in-story appearances, McClure appears as host of "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]" and "[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]". The first is a behind the scenes look at ''The Simpsons'', answering questions and featuring extra "never before seen" material.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular|episodelink=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, John; Silverman, David; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-03 |season=7 |number=138}}</ref> The second is an episode presenting three possible spin-offs from ''The Simpsons''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase|episodelink=The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David; Greaney, Dan; Tompkins, Steve; Affleck, Neil; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-03 |season=7 |number=138}}</ref>

==Character==
===Creation===
[[Image:Troyconcept.png|thumb|right|200px|A concept drawing of McClure by [[Mark Kirkland]], for the episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]"]]
McClure was based on the typical "washed up" Hollywood actor. [[B movie]] actors [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Doug McClure]] served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects.<ref name=first/><ref name=inter>{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subjectlink = Matt Groening| interviewer = [[Terry Gross]]| title = Fresh Air| program = [[National Public Radio]]| callsign = [[WHYY-FM]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4249835| city = Philadelphia| date = 2004-12-29| accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref> Writer [[Mike Reiss]] later met Doug McClure's daughter, who revealed that her father had found the homage funny. His children would call their father "Troy McClure" when his back was turned.<ref name=first/> According to show creator [[Matt Groening]], [[Phil Hartman]] was cast in the role due to his ability to pull "the maximum amount of humor" out of any line he was given.<ref name=inter/> McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself.<ref>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Development===
McClure's character is most developed in "A Fish Called Selma", which provides a more in-depth look into his private life and backstory.<ref name=fcs/> [[Show runner]]s [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] were fans of Phil Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give Hartman as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of McClure's marriage to [[Selma Bouvier]], as she was "always marrying people".<ref name=fcs/> Animator [[Mark Kirkland]] was particularly pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting Hartman's voice-over performances, and the episode allowed him and the other animators to "open [McClure] up visually as a character".<ref name=fcs/> Throughout "A Fish Called Selma", it is hinted that McClure has strange sexual behavior. The writers did not initially know what the "unsavory" sexual preference would be, but eventually decided on a fish fetish, using a suggestion from executive producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Josh Weinstein described the fish fetish concept as "so perverted and strange, it was over the top".<ref name=fcs/>

===Retirement===
Phil Hartman [[Phil Hartman#Death|was killed]] by his wife Brynn on May 28, 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9805/28/hartman/|title=Phil Hartman, wife die in apparent murder-suicide|accessdate=2007-06-08|date=[[1998-05-28]]|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> Rather than replace Hartman with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other recurring character, [[Lionel Hutz]], from the show.<ref name=inter/> McClure last appeared in the season ten episode "[[Bart the Mother]]", which was dedicated to Hartman.<ref name="finalep">{{cite news|title=Tributes To A Star And His Voices|accessdate=2008-10-24|date=1998-09-23|work=[[The Record]]|author=Virginia Rohan|page=Y8}}</ref> Before his death, Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a live-action film about McClure, which would be penned by some of the show's writers.<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homerpalooza]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> He noted that he was "looking forward to his live-action movie, publicizing [McClure's] [[Betty Ford clinic|Betty Ford]] appearances."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/H/Hartman_Phil/1996/12/01/758979.html|title=Phil: The Jerky Guy|accessdate=2008-08-04|date=[[1996-12-01]]|publisher=[[Canoe]]}}</ref> [[Matt Groening]] later told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' that the idea never "got further than enthusiasm", but "would have been really fun".<ref name="empire">{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Life In Development Hell | pages = 76 | publisher = ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' | date = [[2007-05-24]] | accessdate = 2007-06-08}}</ref>

==Reception and cultural influence==
Even after his retirement, Troy McClure remains a popular supporting character. [[IGN]] ranked McClure first in their 2006 list of the "Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters", calling him "a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can be".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p5.html|title=Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters|accessdate=2007-06-08|date=[[2006-09-06]]|author=Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> In a 2007 article on ''Simpsons'' guest stars, Adam Finley of [[TV Squad]] wrote that McClure was "responsible for some of the funniest moments in Simpsons history".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/20/the-five-great-simpsons-guest-stars/|title=The Five: Great Simpsons guest stars|accessdate=2007-06-23|date=[[2006-06-20]]|author=Adam Finley|publisher=TV Squad}}</ref> Hartman ranked first on [[AOL]]'s list of their favorite 25 ''Simpsons'' guest stars.<ref>{{cite web|author=Potts, Kimberly|title=Favorite 'Simpsons' Guest Stars|url=http://television.aol.com/feature/the-simpsons/guest-stars|accessdate=2008-11-24|publisher=[[AOL]]}}</ref> [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] argues in ''[[Planet Simpson]]'' that McClure and [[Lionel Hutz]] "together...represent the most significant contribution to the show outside of its permanent cast", adding that "the show's Golden Age is hard to imagine without them". He continues, "The smarmy Hollywood type...has been done to death, but Hartman's version breathed new life into it with each appearance. McClure has become the [[apotheosis]] of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny reinterpretation whose trademark introduction...has become a shorthand way to describe any grossly artificial media figure."<ref name=Turner>{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Chris | title=[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]] |publisher=Random House of Canada |isbn=0-679-31318-4|pages=g. 405–6}}</ref>

McClure's most prominent episode, "[[A Fish Called Selma]]", is often regarded as one of the best episodes in the show's history, and is a favorite of many staff members.<ref name=fcs/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' placed the episode eighth on their top 25 ''The Simpsons'' episode list,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_2,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|accessdate=2007-06-09|date=[[2003-01-29]]|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''}}</ref> and IGN named the episode the best of the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]], calling it the "obvious pick". They also deemed McClure's ''Planet of the Apes'' musical the best moment of the episode and "maybe even the whole show".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/731/731095p2.html|title=The Simpsons: 17 Seasons, 17 Episodes|author=Goldman, Eric; Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2006-09-08]]|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref>
