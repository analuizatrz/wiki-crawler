Meanwhile, Lois begins to question whether she should [[breastfeeding|breastfeed]] Stewie any longer, as he is beginning to hurt her when feeding. Peter's free maid arrives, however, Peter fails to understand that the maid is a native speaker of the [[English language]], and begins speaking in simplified terms with her. Joan, Peter's maid begins her work by pulling items out of Peter's belly, the moving on to carrying Peter on her back when he wants to go to the local store. Meanwhile, Lois decides to refrain from breast-feeding Stewie, after advice by Brian, who slowly responds after Lois shows him her breasts. Upon meeting her, Quagmire invites her out with him the following day, where he exclaims to himself after leaving Peter's house that he is in love. 

Peter decides to give his maid an unnecessary amount of work for her final night, he does this by filling a [[watermelon]] full of fire crackers and giving it to [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], only for it to explode all around her. Meanwhile, Stewie does not take kindly to not being breast fed. Several weeks later, Quagmire [[Marriage|proposes marriage]] to Joan, to which she accepts and the couple begin to prepare their marriage ceremony, much to Cleveland, Joe and Peter's shock. Lois, Peter and their neghbours visit Quagmire's house, only to find that he has changed his personality and has a different outlook on life, however, Peter still believing this to be a prank, attempts to Quagmire by showing him [[Porn|pornographic]] magazines. Meanwhile, Stewie becomes increasingly stressed about not being breast-fed, thus resorting to jump from a playground swing on to another woman's breasts, only for Lois to have to pull him away, after he exclaims that the woman's breasts are lies. After discovering her [[bra]] size has dramatically increased, Lois's clothes begin to break, however, after Peter spills wine on her, he goes to shake her dry, thus making Quagmire think twice about his new marriage after seeing Lois's boobs shake.
