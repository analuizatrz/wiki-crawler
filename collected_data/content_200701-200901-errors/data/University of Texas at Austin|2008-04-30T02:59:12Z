The '''University of Texas at Austin''' (often referred to as '''The University of Texas''', '''UT Austin''', '''UT''', or '''Texas''') is a doctoral/research university located in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]. It is the [[flagship#University campuses|flagship]]<ref name="flagship1">{{cite news | url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/2005/07/mcdonald21.html | title=Texas flagship universities celebrate milestone of Giant Magellan Telescope partnership | publisher=University of Texas | date=2005-07-21 | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref><ref name="flagship4">{{cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/edu/364/000082118/ | title=University of Texas | work=NNDB | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref><ref name="flagship5">{{cite news | url=http://washingtontimes.com/culture/20051002-103300-6882r.htm | title=Flagship university of Texas seeks to boost diversity | author=Austin, Liz | date=2005-10-03 | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> institution of [[University of Texas System|The University of Texas System]]. The main campus is located less than a mile from the [[Texas State Capitol]] in Austin. UT Austin was named one of the original eight "[[Public Ivy]]" institutions of higher education; i.e., a public institution that "provides an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price."<ref>''The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities'' (2001) by Howard and Matthew Greene</ref> Founded in 1883, the university has had [[List of largest United States universities by enrollment|the fifth largest]] single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2006 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&ndash;2003), with nearly 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff.<ref name="EnrEss" /> It currently holds the [[List of largest Texas universities by enrollment|largest enrollment]] of all colleges in the state of Texas.<ref>http://www.txhighereddata.org/Reports/DocFetch.cfm?DocID=1434&Format=XLS&Confirmed=1</ref> 

The university also operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, most notably the [[J. J. Pickle Research Campus]]. Texas is a major center for academic research, annually exceeding $380 million in funding. In addition, the university's athletic programs were recognized by ''[[Sports Illustrated]],'' which dubbed UT "America's Best Sports College" in 2002.

==History==
{{main|History of the University of Texas at Austin}}
[[Image:Oldmainbuilding.jpg|right|thumbnail|The University's old Main Building in 1903.]]
The first mention of a public university in [[Texas]] can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]].  Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was ever taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas|Constitution of the Republic]], which included a provision to establish public education in [[Republic of Texas|republic]], including two universities or colleges. On [[January 26]], [[1839]], the Congress of Texas agreed to eventually set aside fifty [[league (unit)|league]]s of land towards the effort; in addition, forty acres in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated "College Hill."

In 1846, Texas was annexed into the [[United States]]. The state legislature passed the [[Act of 1858]], which set aside $100,000 in United States [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] towards construction. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues. However, Texas's [[secession]] from the Union and the [[American Civil War]] prevented further action on these plans.

The passing of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]] in 1862 facilitated the creation of [[Texas A&M University]], which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas.<ref>[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct8.html Texas A&M University] ''Handbook of Texas Online.'' Accessed [[29 July]] [[2006]].</ref> The [[Texas Constitution|Texas Constitution of 1876]] mandated that the state establish a university "at an early day," calling for the creation of a "university of the first class," The University of Texas. It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated one million acres (4000 km²) in West Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and [[grazing rights]] going to The University of Texas and Texas A&M. 

In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department. On the original "College Hill," an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on [[September 15]], [[1883]].

The old [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] [[Main Building of The University of Texas at Austin|Main Building]] served as the central point of the campus's forty acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes. However, by the 1930s, discussions rose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.

Constitutional restrictions against funding building construction hampered expansion. However, the funds generated by [[petroleum|oil]] discovered on university-owned grounds in 1923 were put towards its general endowment fund. This extra revenue allowed the university to pay down its debt, and pass bond in 1931 and 1947, funding the necessary expansion after the enrollment spike following [[World War II]]. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of [[eminent domain]]. With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original forty acres.

==Campus==

The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In February 2006, the Board of Regents voted to update and expand the football stadium, and in March 2006 the student body passed a referendum to build a new Student Activities Center next to Gregory Gym on the east side of campus, pending final approval by the Board of Regents. According to ''The Daily Texan'', the project is estimated to cost $51 million and is set to open between fall 2010 and fall 2012. Funding will primarily come from students, raising tuition by a maximum of $65 per semester.<ref>Terrell, Abby.

===Admission===
As a state public university, UT Austin is subject to [[Texas House Bill 588]] (aka HB 588, the top ten percent law, or the [[percent plan]]), which guarantees graduating Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university. For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity at UT Austin is deemed "more selective" according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carnegie Foundation Classifications of The University of Texas at Austin |url=http://carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&subkey=16431&start=782 |accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref> In fall 2006, a total of 27,315 applications were received and 13,305 were admitted. In fall 2007, 27,232 applications and 13,781 students were admitted.<ref>{{cite web| title=Information, Resources and Services for Prospective Students |url=http://bealonghorn.utexas.edu/ |accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref>

===Faculty and research===
[[Image:HET Dome.jpg|thumb|right|The 9.2 m [[Hobby-Eberly Telescope]] at The [[McDonald Observatory]] is the third largest telescope in the world.]]
In Fall 2007, UT Austin employed 2,300 [[Full-time equivalent|full-time]] faculty members, 51% who were tenured. The student-to-faculty ratio is 19.23.<ref>http://www.utexas.edu/academic/oir/statistical_handbook/07-08/pdf/0708facultystaff.pdf</ref> The university's faculty includes winners of the [[Nobel Prize]], the [[Pulitzer Prize]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[National Medal of Technology]], and numerous other awards.

The university exceeds $446 million in annual research funding<ref>http://www.utsystem.edu/news/fastfacts.html University of Texas System - Office of Public Affairs</ref> and has earned more than 400 patents since its founding. (Licensing deals generate more than $5 million annually for the university.)<ref>http://www.utexas.edu/opa/pubs/facts/research.php</ref>

===Endowment===
{{main|Permanent University Fund}}

The university receives income from an endowment known as the [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF), with $11.6 billion ([[List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment|fourth]]-largest in the [[United States]]) in assets as of November 2005,<ref name="endowment">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.nacubo.org/x2321.xml|title=2005 NACUBO Endowment Study|publisher=National Association of College and University Business Officers|accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref> of which 30 percent is dedicated to the university.<ref name="30-percent">As required by the Texas Constitution[http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html], the UT System gets two-thirds of the [[Available University Fund]], the annual distribution of PUF income. A regental policy[http://www.utsystem.edu/OGC/RegentalPolicies/AUFspend.htm] requires that ''at least'' 45 percent of this money go to UT Austin for "program enrichment." By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the ''minimum'' amount of AUF income that can be distributed to UT Austin under current policies. The Regents, however, can and do decide to allocate additional amounts to UT Austin. Also, the majority of the UT System share of the AUF is used for debt service of UT System [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], some of which were issued for the benefit of UT Austin[http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf]. One should note that the Regents are free to change the 45 percent minimum of the UT System share going to UT Austin at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.</ref> Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of this fund. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and [[Texas A&M University System|the Texas A&M University System]]; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10  percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University's total endowment value.

==Student life==
The university enrolls 37,377 undergraduate, 11,533 graduate and 1,467 law students. The student population includes students from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries, most notably, [[South Korea]], followed by [[India]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Mexico]] and the [[Republic of China]], are represented.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/academic/oir/statistical_handbook/04-05/students/analysis/ 2004-2005 Statistical Handbook, Degrees Conferred] ''The University of Texas Office of Institutional Research.''

===Housing===
The campus is currently home to fourteen residence halls, the last of which opened for residence in Spring 2007. On-campus housing can hold more than 7,100 students.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/student/housing/pdfs/reshall_masterplan_100405.pdf Residence Hall Master Plan] ''The University of Texas Division of Housing and Food.''

The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community. The first UT Greek chapters opened in [[1883]]; the same year as the university.<ref name="GreekGuide">{{cite web|title=Sorority & Fraternity Information Guide 2007–2008|work=The University of Texas Office of the Dean of Students|url=http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/gle/downloads/GrkGde07.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref> Over 11 percent of undergraduate students make up the nearly 4,500 members. With more then 50 national [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] chapters, the university's Greek community is one of the largest in the nation.

The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as "America's Best Sports College" in a 2002 analysis performed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/10/01/1_10/ America's Best Sports Colleges] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.

However this ranking is based only on clients of the Collegiate Licensing Company which does not handle licensing for approximately three dozen large schools such as Ohio State, Southern California, UCLA, Michigan State, and Texas A&M.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/longhorns/08/16/0816royalties.html|title=Texas repeats as national champion in merchandising|publisher=''[[The Austin American-Statesman]]''|accessdate=2007-08-17|date=2007-08-16|author=Maher, John}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.com/clcweb/publishing.nsf/Content/rankings.html|title=The Collegiate Licensing Company Rankings|accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>

The University of Texas has traditionally been considered a [[college football]] powerhouse.<ref name="Potomac">{{cite book  | url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=167960 | title=Texas Longhorns Football History A to Z | author=Pennington, Richard | publisher=Potomac Books | accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref><ref name="Tarheel">{{cite news |work=DailyTarheel.com | publisher= The Daily Tarheel | author=Fitt, Aaron | url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2002/09/14/Sportsaturday/Its-Not.About.Mack-1349746.shtml?norewrite200606280132&sourcedomain=www.dailytarheel.com | title=It's not about Mack | date=[[September 14]] [[2002]] | accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref><ref name="BC$">{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/04/commentary/column_sportsbiz/sportsbiz/ | title=Texas is the BC$ champ, too - Even before their stunning upset of USC, the Longhorns were big winners where it matters. |work=CNNMoney | publisher=Turner Broadcasting | date=[[January 5]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>  At the start of the 2007 season, the Longhorns were ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage.<ref name="Ark State gw">{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/doc_lib/090107_notes.pdf | title=Game notes - Arkansas State | work=MackBrownTexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas & Host Interactive | format=PDF | date=[[September 1]][[2007]] | accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref> The team experienced its greatest success under coach [[Darrell Royal]], winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, 1970, and winning a fourth title under head coach [[Mack Brown]] in 2005 after the 41-38 victory over previously undefeated [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] in the 2006 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]].

In recent years, the men's [[college basketball|basketball]] team has gained prominence, advancing to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, and the [[Elite Eight]] in 2006 and 2008.

The university's [[college baseball|baseball]] team is considered one of the best in the nation with more trips to the [[College World Series]] than any other school, with wins in 1949, 1950, 1970, 1983, 2002 and 2005.

Additionally, the university's highly successful men's and women's swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA Division I titles.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} In particular, the men's team is under the leadership of Eddie Reese, who served as the head men's coach at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, and the 2004 Games in Athens.

===Rivalries===
One of the university's notable rivals in many sports is [[Texas A&M Athletics|Texas A&amp;M University]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/texas/ Sports Illustrated's 50th Anniversary: Texas] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' poll (conducted by [[Harris Interactive]]) shows 56% of respondents picked Texas vs Texas A&M as the biggest rivalry, followed by Texas vs Oklahoma at 15%, and the Cowboys vs Texans at 7%.</ref> The two schools have acknowledged the importance of this rivalry by creating the [[State Farm]] [[Lone Star Showdown]] series, which encompasses all sports where both schools field a varsity team. The football game played between the two schools is the third longest-running rivalry in the nation and is the longest-running rivalry for both schools. The game used to be played on Thanksgiving day but in recent years has been played on the day following [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. Both schools traditionally hold a rally each year before the football game &mdash; Texas hosts the [[Hex Rally]], and students at Texas A&M host the [[Aggie Bonfire#Revival|Aggie Bonfire]] (although it is no longer an officially sanctioned Texas A&M event because of the deaths of 12 students in 1999). 

Some fans and observers, however, argue that the Longhorns' biggest rival in football is the [[University of Oklahoma]].<ref>[http://totaljibbly.blogspot.com/2005/11/season-it-never-fails.html The Season] ''Total Jibbly''. [[November 22]], [[2005]].</ref>  The football game between Texas and Oklahoma is known as the [[Red River Shootout]] and is held annually in [[Dallas, Texas]], at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]].  In recent years, this rivalry has been particularly spirited, in part due to the fact that at least one school had been ranked in the top five nationally at the time of the game (from 2000-05).

Other schools, such as Arkansas and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Texas Tech]], also consider Texas among their rivals.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200610280086 Texas Longhorns/Texas Tech Raiders Preview Saturday, October 28, 2006] ''[http://sports.yahoo.com/ Yahoo!
