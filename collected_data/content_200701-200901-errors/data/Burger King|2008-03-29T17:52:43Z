'''Burger King''' ({{NYSE|BKC}}), often abbreviated to ''BK'', is a global [[chain store|chain]] of [[hamburger]] [[fast food]] restaurants. The first restaurant was opened in [[Miami, Florida]] in 1954 by [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]], and has since used several variations of [[franchising]] to expand its operations. Burger King Holdings is the parent company of Burger King. In the United States it operates under the Burger King Brands title while internationally it operates under the Burger King Corporation banner. It is a publicly traded company with investment firms of [[TPG Capital, L.P.]], [[Bain Capital]], and [[Goldman Sachs]] each owning about 25% of the company.

At the end of its fiscal year 2007, Burger King reported that there are more than 11,300 outlets in 69 countries; 66% are in the United States and 90% are privately owned and operated. The company has more than 37,000 employees serving approximately 11.4 million customers daily.<ref name="2007report">{{cite web |url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/87/87140/2007_AR.pdf |format=PDF| title=BKC 2007 Annual Report |author=BKC publication |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date=October 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |quote=11,283 Restaurants in 69 countries and territories}}</ref> The company's two largest franchisees are [[Carrols Corporation]] with over 325 restaurants in United States, and [[Hungry Jack's]], which exclusively owns, operates or sub-licenses over 300 restaurants in [[Australia]].<ref name=bkcau>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4275422-1.html |title=Burger King Re-flags Australian Stores |author=Restaurant Business News |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=[[2003-05-30]] |accessdate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> 

The [[Burger King products|Burger King menu]] has evolved from a basic offering of burgers, fries, sodas and milkshakes in 1954 to a larger, more diverse set of offerings that includes several variations of [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[salad]]s and [[breakfast]].

===History===
{{expand-section|It needs more data on the 1970s to mid 1980s period|date=March 15, 2008}}
Burger King's first restaurant, originally called '''Insta Burger King''', was opened on [[December 4]], [[1954]] in a suburb of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]] by James McLamore and David Edgerton; both alumni of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]]. McLamore visited the original McDonald's hamburger stand belonging to [[Dick and Mac McDonald]] in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[California]]; sensing potential in their innovative [[assembly line]]-based production system, he decided to create a version of his own. By 1959, BK had grown to five regional stores in and around the metropolitan Miami area. About this time, McLamore and Edgerton decided to expand BK nationally by using a franchising system; a popular method for expansion due to its low capital cost for the parent company. They formed Burger King Corporation as the parent and began selling territorial franchise licenses to private owners across the US.<ref name="answers">{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/burger-king |title=History of Burger King Corporation |author=[http://www.fundinguniverse.com FundingUniverse.com] |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref>

In 1967, after eight years of private operation, the [[Pillsbury Company]] acquired Burger King and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, BK had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States. Even though Pillsbury owned and operated the company, BK was still the object of a series of failed and successful acquisitions and divestitures. In 1973, Chart House, owner of 350 BK restaurants at the time and one of BK's largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100 million ([[USD]]). When Chart House's bid failed, its owners, Billy and Jimmy Trotter, suggested that Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective Burger King holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company, an offer Pillsbury also declined. After the failed attempts to acquire BK, the relationship with Chart House and the Trotters began to sour; in 1979 BK successfully sued Chart House for improperly acquiring locations in Boston and Houston.<ref name="answers"/> In 1984, Pillsbury purchased Chart House's successor DiversiFoods for $390 million ([[USD]]) after a separate, independent $525 million DiversiFoods management-backed [[leveraged buy-out]] of the company failed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v19/ai_3930610 |title=How Pillsbury 'stole' DiversiFoods for just $390 million |author=Rick Telberg |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=[[1985-09-09]] |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02EFDA1238F931A25751C1A962948260 |title=DiversiFoods Net |publisher=New York Times |date=[[1984-12-12]] |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref>

In 1989, under the ownership of Grand Met, Burger King acquired many locations of its major [[UK]] rival [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] when the parent company bought the Wimpy's brand from its previous owner [[United Biscuits]] and re-branded them as Burger King, giving it an even greater presence in that country. While other "Wimpy" locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence they once did.<ref name="answers"/> In 1997, Grand Metropolitan merged with [[Guinness]] to form a company called [[Diageo]]. Diageo maintained ownership of BKC until 2001 when Diageo decided to focus solely on their beverage products and divest itself of the chain.

By the time of the sale, Burger King's revenues and market share had declined significantly, Burger King had fallen to a near tie for second place with rival [[Wendy's]] in the US market for hamburger chain restaurants.<ref name="slate">{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2102906/ |title=What's wrong with Burger King |author=Daniel Gross |publisher=Slate.com |date=[[2004-06-24]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> For many years leading into the early 2000s Burger King and its various owners plus many of its larger franchises closed many under-performing stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE123EF93BA35752C0A96E948260 |title=Pillsbury  restaurants cutbacks set |author=Calvin Sims |publisher=The New York Times |date=1988-01-08 |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> Several of its largest franchises entered bankruptcy due to the issues surrounding the performance of the brand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_33_23/ai_77757921 |title=Franchisee of Burger Chain Files Chap. 11 |author =Anthony Palazzo |publisher=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=[[2001-08-21]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E7D6153BF936A35751C1A9649C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Fast%20Food%20Industry |title=Big Burger King Franchise chain files for bankruptcy |author= |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[2002-12-05]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref>

===International expansion===
While BK began its foray in to locations outside of the [[continental United States]] in 1963 with a store in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], it did not have a large international presence. This situation changed shortly after the acquisition when Pillsbury opened its first international restaurant in [[Canada]] in 1969. Other international locations followed soon after: [[Oceania]] in 1971 with Hungry Jack's and in [[Europe]] in 1975 with a restaurant in [[Madrid, Spain]]. Beginning in 1982, BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several [[East Asian]] countries, including [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and [[Korea]].<ref name="answers"/> Due to high competition, all of the Japanese locations closed by the end of 2001.

== Franchises ==
<div id=franchises>
{{inuse-section|adding history of franchise structure. Expansion should take about two weeks and will be finished on or about 14 April|date=March 16, 2008}}
When the Burger King Corporation began franchising in 1967, it relied on a regional franchising model where franchisees would purchase the right to open stores within a defined geographic region. These franchise agreements granted BKC very little oversight control over its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control, store image and design and operations procedures.<ref name=answers/>

<!---This model remained in place until 1978 when Donald Smith restructured all future franchising agreements, disallowing new owners from living more than one hour from their restaurants, preventing corporations from owning franchises and prohibiting franchisees from operating other chains.--->

At the end of its fiscal year 2007, Burger King reported that there are more than 11,300 outlets in 69 countries; 66% are in the United States and 90% are privately owned and operated. The company has more than 37,000 employees serving approximately 11.4 million customers daily.

By 1974 Carrols owned and operated over 150 Carrols Club restaurants in the [[Northeast United States]] and abroad. In 1975 the company entered into a franchise agreement with Burger King Corporation and converted its existing Carrols restaurants in the US into BK locations, closed those stores that were not able to be updated and sold off its international operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carrols.com/html/History.htm# |title=Carrols Corp.

Hungry Jack's, sometimes colloquially abbreviated to HJ's, is the exclusive Australian master franchisee of Burger King Corporation. Its parent company is Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Competitive Foods Australia, a privately held company owned by [[Jack Cowin]]. With over 300 locations in that country, HJ's is the second largest franchisee of Burger King in the world.

When Burger King decided to expand its operations into [[Australia]], it found that its business name was already [[Australian trademark law|trademarked]] by a man running a small [[takeaway]] food shop in [[Queensland]]. Thus, BK was forced to change the name when it decided to open stores in the country - the only time this has happened in its corporate history. Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, [[Jack Cowin]], with a list of possible alternative names that the Australian Burger King restaurants could be branded as. The names were derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury. Cowin selected the "Hungry Jack" brand name, one of Pillsbury's US [[pancake]] mixture products, and slightly changing the name to a [[possessive form]] by adding an [[apostrophe#Possessive apostrophe|apostrophe]] '[[s]]' thus forming the new name '''Hungry Jack's'''. Accordingly, the first Australian franchise of the Burger King Corporation, established in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1971, was branded as Hungry Jack's.<ref name=bkcau/>

Hungry Jack's currently owns and operates or sub-licenses all of the Hungry Jack's and Burger King restaurants in Australia. As the master franchise for the continent, the company is responsible for licensing new operators, opening its own stores and performing standards oversight of franchised locations in Australia.

In the United States, approximately 90% of Burger King's franchises banded together to form the National Franchise Association (NFA). The 900 member group is based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and is designed to provide what the group calls Franchisee Relations Advocacy: it acts as a corporate negotiator that mediates with corporate-franchise disputes; a  [[lobbyist|government lobbying group]] to deal with issues that effect the fast food industry as a whole; and it provides group [[health insurance|health]], [[property insurance|property]] and [[casualty insurance|casualty]] [[insurance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfabk.org/pdf_doc/NFA%20Top%20Ten.pdf |type=pdf |title=Top 10 Reasons to Belong to the NFA |author=NFA publication |publisher=Burger King National Franchise Association |date=[[2007-12-04]] |accessdate=2008-03-16 |quote=}}</ref> In 2001, the group announced a plan to purchase Burger King Corporation from then-parent Diaego after the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20% of BKC on the [[NYSE]]. The NFA believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diaego bolster its liquor brands. The deal collapsed when the NFA was unable to put together an acceptable financing package.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2000/06/23/cndia23.xml |title=Burger King chief quits for UK post |author=Alistar Osborne |publisher=[[the Daily Telegraph]] |date=[[2001-03-21]] |accessdate=2008-03-23 |quote=DENNIS MALAMATINAS abruptly quit yesterday as Burger King's chief executive as Diageo announced plans to float the fast-food business on the New York Stock Exchange, valuing it at Â£2 billion or more.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2000/07/21/cnbur21.xml |title=Franchisees seek to buy Burger King |author=Andrew Cave |publisher=[[the Daily Telegraph]] |date=[[2001-03-21]] |accessdate=2008-03-23 |quote=BURGER King's army of American franchisees want to buy the business in a bid to thwart the chain's planned flotation by its parent company, Diageo.}}</ref>

In a 2005 dispute with its the NFA over issues including brand development and advertising, Burger King severed its relations with the group. Claiming that the NFA was resisting structural changes that BK was making in regards to pricing, hours and its new gift card program, CEO John Chindsey claimed ''many instances of the NFA's non-cooperation and affirmative disruption of efforts to improve the Burger King system.'' were the reason for the break. The company also announced that it would be diverting a $1 million (USD) NFA advertising subsidy into the company's own advertising fund. In a response, the NFA chairman Daniel Fitzpatrick responded in a letter to BKH stating ''to sever relations with the ... NFA is extremely regrettable" and based on "an erroneous set of facts, innuendo and rumor.'' and claimed that BKH owed the NFA $1.7 million in total subsidy funds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/news/print.phtml?id=4744 |title=Burger King breaks with franchise group |author= |publisher=[[QSR Magazine]] |date=[[2005-10-21]] |accessdate=2008-03-17 |quote=}}</ref> The two sides settled their differences in April 2006 when Burger King Holdings agreed to pay the disputed subsidy funds to the group.

==Legal issues==
As with other [[multi-national corporation]]s, Burger King has had its share of controversies and legal issues over the course of its existence. Issues have included trademark disputes, controversies with animal rights groups, health issues and labor relations. Several of its legal cases have been precedent setting in their scope, both in the United States and abroad. Depending upon its ownership and executive staff at the time, its responses to controversial situations has varied from acceding to demands to refusal to concede its position regardless of the outcome.

<div id=hjsuit>
;Burger King Corporation v. Hungry Jack's Pty Limited ([[Case citation|[2001] NSWCA 187]])

In 1991, Hungry Jack's Pty Limited renewed its [[franchise agreement]] with Burger King Corporation which allowed the Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee, however one of the conditions of the agreement was that Hungry Jack's had to open a certain number of stores each year for the term of the contract. In 1996, shortly after the [[Australian trademark law|Australian trademark]] on the Burger King name lapsed, BKC made a claim that Hungry Jack's had violated the conditions of the renewed franchise agreement by failing to the expand the chain at the rate defined in the contract and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation in partnership with [[Royal Dutch Shell]]'s Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd., began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in [[Sydney]] and throughout the Australian regions of [[New South Wales]], [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref name="zesb">{{cite web |url=http://www.zarcolaw.com/CM/News/news26.asp |title=Burger King Hit With Whopper ($44.6 Million) Of A Judgment |author=Alina Matas |publisher=Zargo Einhorn Salkowski & Brito.

As a result of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his company Competitive Foods Australia, began legal proceedings in 2001 against the Burger King Corporation claiming BKC had violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breech of the contract. The [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] agreed with Cowin and determined that BKC had violated the terms of the contract and awarded Hungry Jack's $46.9 million [[AUD]] ($41.6 million 2001 [[USD|US dollars]]).<ref>{{Cite Case AU|NSWCA|187|2001}}</ref> In its decision, the Court said that Burger King sought to engineer a default of the franchise agreement so that the company could limit the number of new Hungry Jackâs branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, which was a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.<ref>{{Cite Case AU|hcatranscripts|S157|1|2001}}</ref><ref name=findlawbkvhj/>

After BKC lost the case, it decided to terminate its business in the country and sold its operations and assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises in the region as the Burger King brand's master franchisee. TPF administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of BKC reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required BKC to provide administrative and advertising support as to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_23_37/ai_103382728 |title=Hungry Jack's to replace BK brand in Australia |author=[[Gale Group|The Gale Group]] |publisher=Nations Restaurant News |date=[[2003-06-09]] |accessdate=2008-03-08 |quote="Consolidation means more money for marketing and will create a powerful, single brand with an increased focus on operations excellence that should add to growth in profitability," Brad Blum, chief executive of Miami-based Burger King, said.}}</ref> TPF transfered its control of the BK franchises to HJP, which subsequently renamed the majority of the remaining BK locations as Hungry Jack's.<ref name=sbj-bktohj/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/01/1054406074309.html |title=Burger King slips into Hungry Jacks uniform |author=[[Associated Press|AP Wire]] |publisher=[[the Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=[[2003-09-13]] |accessdate=2008-03-08 |quote=Burger King Corp's new management said on Friday it was ceding the Australian market to the Hungry Jack's brand, dissolving a convoluted relationship that at one time went to court in a franchising dispute.}}</ref> While HJP is now the exclusive master franchisee for Burger King in Australia and has the right to allow new Burger King locations in the country, no new locations have opened and only a small handful of BK restaurants remain in New South Wales.

;Burger King v. Rudzewicz ([[Case citation|471 U.S. 462]])

In 1965, two Michigan businessmen, John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara, entered into a franchise agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. After attending training courses at regional Burger King training facilities in Michigan and in the Florida headquarters on how to run a Burger King franchise, they began operation of their new business. Sales began to decline at the location after several years, and because of their financial difficulties, they failed to pay their required [[franchise fee]]s and [[rent]] service to Burger King Corporation. This prompted BKC to file a lawsuit in Florida in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] for [[breach of contract]] and [[trademark infringement]] against Rudzewicz and MacShara because they continued operation of their restaurant after they were served notice to vacate the property.<ref name=peloso>{{cite web |url=http://www.invispress.com/law/civpro/burger.html |title=Burger King v. Rudzewicz |author=Christopher D. Peloso |publisher= |date=[[2007-05-19]] |accessdate=2008-03-04 |quote=}}</ref>

The District Court found that Florida has personal jurisdiction under Florida's [[long-arm statute]]. They also found for Burger King and ordered Rudzewicz to close the restaurant, to which Rudzewicz and MacShae appealed. In their appeal, they claimed that since they were residents of Michigan, and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida, that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Additionally it was claimed that the long-arm statute violated the [[14th Amendment]] and was unconstitutional. Citing a similar case, [[World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision.<ref name=findlaw/> In turn, Burger King Corporation appealed the Appellate Court's ruling to the [[US Supreme Court]] and was granted a hearing.<ref name=peloso/>

In its decision, the Supreme Court overturned the Appellate Court and found that Florida does have jurisdiction in the case. The Court concluded that the defendants, Rudzewicz and MacShae, sought out their franchise in the state of Florida and were availed of the protections of that state and were, therefore, subject to jurisdiction there. Additionally, the Court reasoned that the defendants had a "substantial and continuing" relationship with Burger King in Florida and that due process would not be violated because the defendants should have reasonably anticipated being summoned into court in Florida for breach of contract.<ref name=peloso/><ref name=findlaw>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=471&page=462 |title=471 U.S. 462 |publisher=[[Findlaw]] |date=[[1985-05-20]] |accessdate=2008-03-04 |quote=}}</ref>

;Burger King of Florida, Inc. v. Hoots ([[Case citation|403 F.2d 904]])
[[Image:Mattoon Burger King.jpg|thumb|200px|The Hoots' family ''Burger King'' restaurant located on the corner of Charleston Ave. and Fifteenth St. in Mattoon, Illinois. (September 2007)]]

As the company expanded, it became engaged in several disputes in regards to [[trademarks]]. The most prominent incident of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)|Burger King]] located in [[Mattoon, Illinois]]. Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an [[ice cream]] shop in the city of Mattoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop located in a former garage next to the original operation. Keeping with theme related to the name of the ice cream shop, ''Frigid Queen'', they named their burger stand ''Burger King'' and registered their [[trademark]] with the [[state of Illinois]] in 1959. In 1962 The Hootses, with knowledge of the Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation, added a second location located in [[Charleston, Illinois]].<ref name="kiley-decision"/><ref name="hoots">{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A2686 |title=The burger king and queen of Mattoon |author=John Jermaine |publisher=the Illinois Times |date=[[2003-11-20]] |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> 

In 1961, with its first location in [[Skokie, Illinois]], Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening stores and by 1967 had over twenty locations spread throughout the state. The Hootses, claiming that their trademark gave them exclusive rights to the name in Illinois sued BK in the state, and later federal, courts under the case ''Burger King of Florida, Inc. v. Hoots 403 F.2d 904 (7th Cir. 1968)''. The decision issued by [[United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois]], and upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], stated that the BKC federal trademark, applied for in 1961 and granted in 1963, took precedence over the Hootses' older, state trademark; The Court granted the Hootses exclusive rights to the Burger King trademark located within a circular area defined with a 20&nbsp;mile (32&nbsp;km) radius centered on their original location.<ref name="hoots"/><ref>The court cited numerous examples where the federal law explicitly gave federal trademarks stronger weight than other kinds.  See, for example, {{USC|15|1127}}: "The intent of this chapter is ... to protect registered marks used in such commerce from interference by State, or territorial legislation."</ref>

In 2001 the animal rights group [[PETA]] began targeting the various fast food chains in the United States over issues regarding the treatment of chickens by suppliers such as [[Tyson]]. Utilizing parodies of corporate logos and slogans, the group sought to publicly embarrass the companies into changing their corporate policies in dealing with poultry suppliers. After winning concessions from McDonald's with its ''McCruelty'' campaign, the group targeted Burger King with a six month campaign it called ''Murder King''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/businesswire/feeds/businesswire/2008/02/11/businesswire20080211006047r1.html |title=PETA Praises Safeway for Adopting New Industry-Leading Animal Welfare Policies |author=[[Business Wire]] |publisher=[[Forbes Magazine]] |date=[[2008-02-11]] |accessdate=2008-03-09 |quote=June 2001: Following PETA's six-month "Murder King" campaign, Burger King agrees to adopt standards that are in some areas better than those adopted by McDonald's.}}</ref> The group and its supporters, including celebrities such as [[Alec Baldwin]], [[James Cromwell]], and [[Richard Pryor]], staged protests outside BK restaurant across the US calling for the company to establish new compliance guidelines for it poultry suppliers. On [[28 June]] [[2001]], Burger King agreed with the group and established a series of procedures to ensure that its suppliers were conforming to agreed standards for animal welfare. These changes, along with the company's new vegetarian offering the [[BK Veggie]] sandwich, drew praise from the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/murderking.htm |title=Burger King Complies With Demand for Improved Animal Welfare Standards. |author=PETA press release |publisher=Femail.com.au |date=[[2001-06-28]] |accessdate=2008-03-09 |quote=The only way to avoid cruelty in meat production is to go vegetarian, but today Burger King has taken giant steps to improve the lives of millions of animals}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_12_36/ai_84237785 |title=PETA helps BK roll out vegetable-based burger |author= |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=[[2002-03-05]] |accessdate=2008-03-09 |quote=Aided by former challenger PETA, the radical animal-rights group, Burger King Corp. began a national rollout of the new BK Veggie burger and new reduced-fat mayonnaise.}}</ref>

In 2006, PETA went before the Burger King Holding's board during its annual board meeting to request the company have its suppliers switch to a more humane method of form of slaughter called [[controlled atmosphere killing]] (CAK) in the preparation of its poultry products. Using a different tack that went beyond stating that the procedure is more humane, the group claimed that the method was economically more feasible for the company as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produced better products by preventing injury to the animal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2006/11/27/daily24.html?jst=b_ln_hl |title=PETA to criticize Burger King poultry choices |author= |publisher=South Florida Business Journal |date=[[2006-11-28]] |accessdate=2008-03-09 |quote=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said it will use its position as a Burger King Holdings stockholder at Wednesday's shareholder's meeting to show its position on the fast-food company's poultry practices.}}</ref> Responding to this new protest, in March 2007 Burger King announced an additional series of changes to it policies regarding animal welfare. In the policy change BK announced that it would favor suppliers of chickens that use CAK rather than electric shocks to knock birds unconscious before slaughter. The company went on to add new policies that require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens; the rules require that 2% of its North American egg suppliers use [[cage-free]] produced eggs and 10% of it pork suppliers use crate free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the [[Humane Society of the United States]] were quoted as saying that Burger Kingâs initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiative would trigger for reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/business/28burger.html |title=Burger King Shifts Policy on Animals |author=Andrew Martin |publisher=[[the New York Times]] |date=[[2007-03-28]] |accessdate=2008-03-09 |quote=In what animal welfare advocates are describing as a "historic advance," Burger King, the worldâs second-largest hamburger chain, said yesterday that it would begin buying eggs and pork from suppliers that did not confine their animals in cages and crates.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2987450 |title=Burger King Offers Cage-Free Food. |author=AP Wire |publisher=Associated Press |date=[[2007-03-28]] |accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref>

Beginning in 2001, the CIW sought a pay raise of 1Â¢ per pound for tomato pickers in the region and began to target these chains with protests, letter writing campaigns and petitions demanding that the companies only purchase tomatoes from suppliers that agree to the pay increase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070929/NEWS01/70929017/1075 |title= Burger King protest plays out in SFM |author=Jacob Ogles |publisher=[[The News-Press]] |date=[[2007-09-27]] |accessdate=2007-10-02}}</ref> In 2005, both McDonald's Corporation and Yum! signed an agreement agreeing with the group's purchasing demands; however Burger King corporate parent Burger King Brands (BKB) declined to enter into an agreement with the group.<ref name=qsr-ciw>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/exclusives/0208/immokalee-1.phtml |title=Tomato Troubles |author=Jamie Hartford |publisher=QSR Magazine |date=[[February 2008]] |accessdate=2008-03-28 |quote=We are working diligently to find a legal way to comply with this scheme.}}</ref>

A December 2007 [[Associated Press]] article about the conflict claimed that the company had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the AP stated BKB had concerns that such agreements might prove to be a possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements as reasons for not entering into an agreement with the labor group. As part of the company's plan, AP claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement with. In a response, the company stated that in Februray 2007 BKB issued a press release claiming that while it is a larger purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of the workers of its suppliers as wages disputes are the province of the said producer. BKB also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships through its Have it Your Way Foundation for family members of CIW workers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/content/news/detail.aspx?id=899 |title=Burger King Corporation Issues "Penny per Pound" Statement |author=BKC press release |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date=[[2007-02-05]] |accessdate=2007-10-04 }}</ref>

In the release, BKH Vice President of Global Food Safety, Quality Assurance, and Regulatory Compliance Steven Grover confirmed the factuality of the AP report and that if the dispute between the growers and the CIW continues, the company would go forward with its plans to stop purchasing tomatoes from farms in the Immokalee region. The company stated that it purchase only 1% of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated ''"Weâre being asked to do something that we have legal questions about. We want to find a way to make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage."''<ref name=nyt-ciw>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/24/us/24tomato.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=us&adxnnlx=1198516223-xZ6CSo6cYFX5T2J1DjmZ3A&pagewanted=all |title=Tomato Pickersâ Wages Fight Faces Obstacles |author=Steven Greenhouse |publisher=[[the New York Times]] |date=[[2007-12-24]] |accessdate=2008-03-28 |quote=}}</ref> CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move, stating ''"...farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region, but says many don't have a human rights organization, such as the CIW, to stand up for their interests. Running away from the scene of the crime, does that make you any more innocent? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost[s] to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound?"''<ref name=qsr-ciw/>

Supporters of the group have stated that they intend to continue to protest BKBs position until such time that the company agrees to sign an agreement with the group.<ref name=nyt-ciw/>

[[Image:Jimmy Fund Card.png|thumb|150px|Burger King issued scratch card for 2007 Jimmy Fund Chance for Kids fund raising drive in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].]]
Burger King has several of its own in-house national [[charitable organization]]s and programs. The first is the Have It Your Way Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit, [[501(c)(3)]] corporation with multiple focuses on hunger alleviation, disease prevention and community education through scholarship programs at colleges in the US. The other charitable organization is the McLamore Foundation, also a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation that provides scholarships to students in the US and its territories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/community/hiywfoundation.aspx |title=the HIYW foundation |author= |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date= |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/community/mclamore.aspx |title=the McLamore Foundation |author= |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date= |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> Additionally, there is an optional literacy program that partners individual restaurants with community schools in the US.

In various regions across the United States, Burger King and its franchises have aligned themselves with several charitable organizations that support research and treatment of juvenile [[cancer]]. Each year these coalitions hold a fund raising drive called '''A Chance for Kids''', which has the restaurants selling [[lottery]]-style [[scratch cards]] for $1. Each card produces a winning prize that is usually a food or beverage product, but includes items such as shopping sprees or trips. In the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], BK has affiliated itself with the [[Major League Baseball]] team the [[Boston Red Sox]] and its charitable foundation, the [[Jimmy Fund]]. The group runs the contest in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], in the [[New York city]] area it operates the contest in association with the Burger King Children's Charities of Metro New York and the [[New York Yankees]].

[[Image:Burger king whopper.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Whopper]] sandwich, Burger King's signature product.]]
When the company began, its menu consisted predominantly of [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[soft drink]]s, and [[dessert]]s. In 1957, BK added its signature item, the [[Whopper]]. This quarter pound [[hamburger]] was created by Burger King founders [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]] as a way to differentiate BK from other burger outlets at the time. The sandwich became famous enough that BK eventually adopted the motto "Home of the Whopper."

One of Donald N. Smith's first changes to the menu was the addition of the Burger King Specialty sandwich line in 1979, which significantly expanded the breadth of the BK menu with many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new specialty sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic, in this case adults 18-34, members of which would be willing spend more on a higher quality product.<ref name=jakle>{{cite book |title=Fast Food: Roadside Restaurants in the Automobile Age |author=John A.

Burger King has employed varied advertising programs, both successful and unsuccessful, since its foundation in 1954. During the 1970s, output included a memorable jingle, the inspiration for its current mascot [[the Burger King]] and several well known and parodied [[slogans]] such as ''Have it your way '' and ''It takes two hands to hold a Whopper''.<ref name="bkcmah" >{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/content/corporation/history.html |title=Marketing and Advertising History |author=BKC publication |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date=[[2007-03-12]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref><ref name="sheph">{{cite web |url=http://shephyken.blogspot.com/2006/05/hold-pickles-hold-lettuce-special.html |title=Customer service and more |author=Shep Hyken |publisher=BlogSpot |date=[[2006-05-26]]|accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref> Burger King introduced the first [[attack ad]] in the fast food industry with the help of then unknown [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] in 1981.

Burger King was a pioneer in the advertising practice known as the [[product tie-in]] with a successful partnering with [[George Lucas]]' [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm, Ltd.]] to promote the 1977 movie [[Star Wars]] film ''[[Star Wars]]'' (later renamed ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'') in which BK sold a set of glasses featuring the main characters from the film. This promotion was one of the first in the [[fast food restaurant|fast food]] industry and set the pattern that continues to the present. BK's early success in the field was overshadowed by a 1982 deal between McDonald's and the [[Walt Disney Company]] to promote Disney's animated films beginning in the mid 1980s and running through the early 1990s. In 1994 Burger King reversed the situation with its own ten film promotional contract with Disney; the venture led to great success for both companies as this period in Disney animated film production is considered to be film company's second Golden Age. BK was able to promote such top ten films such as ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994) and ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995).<ref name="disney">{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Burger-King-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=Burger King Corporation, Turnaround under Grand Met in the 1990s |author= |publisher=[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/ FundingUniverse.com] |date= |accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref> A partnership in association with the [[PokÃ©mon]] franchise at the height of its popularity in 1999 was one of the most successful in the industry, rivaled only by McDonald's\Ty [[Beanie Babies]] cross-promotion in 1999-2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KIDS+SWARM+BURGER+KING+AS+POKEMON-MANIA+STRIKES.(News)(Statistical...-a083629023" |title=Kids swarm Burger King as PokÃ©mon-mania strikes |author=Jason Kandel |publisher=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=[[1999-11-12]] |accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref>

Shortly after the acquisition of Burger King by [[TPG Capital, L.P.]] in 2002, its newly hired [[CEO]] [[Brad Blum|Bradley (Brad) Blum]] set about turning around fortunes of the company by initiating an overhaul its flailing advertising programs. One of the first moves by the company was to reinstate its famous ''Have it your way'' slogan as the corporate motto. BK handed the effort off to its new advertising agency, Miami-based [[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]] (abbreviated as CP+B). CP+B was known for having a hip, subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients, exactly what BK was looking for.<ref name="BK-BBlum"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=14482 |title=Burger King Corporation Selects Crispin Porter + Bogusky As Lead Creative Advertising Agency|publisher=HispanicBusiness.com| date=[[23 January]] [[2006]]}}</ref> One of CP+B strategies was to revive the Burger King character used during BKs 1970s/1980s [[Burger King Kingdom]] children's advertising campaign as a [[caricature]]d variation now simply called "the King". The farcical nature of ''the Burger King'' centered advertisements inspired an [[internet meme]] where the King is [[Photo manipulation|photoshopped]] into unusual situations that are either comical or menacing, many times followed with the phrase ''Where is your God now?''.

Additionally, CP+B created a series new characters like [[the Subservient Chicken]] and the faux [[nu-metal]] band [[Coq Roq]] featured in a series of [[Viral marketing|viral]] web-based advertisements on sites such as [[MySpace]] and various BK corporate pages to compliment the various television and print promotional campaigns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mad.co.uk/Main/Home/Articles/be50c1fbeab44225a611af5edb1d4ae7/Burger-King-in-MySpace-campaign.html |title=Burger King in MySpace campaign |publisher=Mad.co.uk |date=[[2006-05-13]] |accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://marketingtoday.blogspot.com/2005/07/burger-king-goes-tasteless.html |title=Burger King Goes Tasteless |author=Peter Delegge |publisher=MarketingToday.com |date=[[2005-07-31]] |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/advertising/3877633-1.html |title=Burger King's Table Guests |author=Robyn Tippins |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=[[2006-08-03]] |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref> One of the more unique promotions that CP+B devised was the creation of a series of three [[advergaming|advergames]] for the [[X-Box 360]].

[[Image:Sitting king.png|thumb|120px|Alternate version of the ''Sitting King'' logo used until 1968.]]
The first logo that Burger King used is identified simply as the ''Sitting King'' logo; the first version of [[the Burger King]] character is shown sitting atop the of the sign holding a beverage. The sign has several versions, with the King either sitting atop a hamburger or on an inverted [[trapezoid]] with the company name along the top and its motto ''Home of the Whopper'' below it; some signs did not include the King and only had the inverted trapezoid. This logo was used in one form or another until 1969 when the famous Burger King "bun halves" logo made its debut, and has continued in one form or another until the current day. As implied by its name, the logo is meant to resemble a [[hamburger]]; the logo had two orange semi-circular "buns" surrounding the name, which was the "meat" of the logo. In 1994 BK updated the logo with a graphical tightening, replacing the aging "bulging" font with a smoother font with rounded edges. In addition, all secondary signing, such as roof and directional signs, was also updated with new rounded font.

In 1999, BK again revised its logo. The new Burger King logo is a stylized version of the original "bun halves" logo. BK changed the color of the restaurant's name from orange to red lettering, while leaving them sandwiched between two yellow bun halves. The new logo also tilts the bun halves and the [[font]] on an [[Coordinate axis|axis]], has a smaller "bun" motif and wraps the burger with a blue crescent whipping around the buns giving it a more [[circular]] appearance. Most restaurants did not acquire newer signs with the new logo, menus, and drive-thru ordering speakers until 2001. Again all secondary signage was updated with the new logo and type face, and all sign posts were repainted to match the blue coloring of the new crescent from their original black.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logoblog.org/burger-king-logo.php |title=Burger King Logo |author= |publisher=LogoBlog.org |date= |accessdate=2008-03-10 |quote=In 1969, Burger King established its famous Burger King âbun halvesâ logo that lasted till early 1990s.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr4-14bk.html |title=Burger King Shares Extensive Transformation Plans |author=BKC press release |publisher=BizJournals on Bison.com |date=[[1999-04-14]] |accessdate=2007-10-09 }}</ref>

The Hungry Jack's logo is based on the Burger King "bun halves" design. HJ currently uses a variation of the second generation "bun halves" logo, featuring the smoother font used in the Burger King logo from 1994. Currently, the only region that BK uses non-Latin text is the Middle East. In those Arabic speaking countries the logo is mirrored and uses Arabic characters; otherwise the logo is identical to the "blue crescent" logo used in the west.
