Before Ray Whitney played his first game on the ice, he was one of the Oilers' stick boys during Wayne Gretzky's late career in [[Edmonton]]; the other was [[Ryan Smyth]]. Ray was drafted in the second round (32nd overall) in the [[1991 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[San Jose Sharks]]. He has played for several different NHL teams during his 14 year career, including the San Jose Sharks ([[1991-92 NHL season|1991-92]] to [[1996-97 NHL season|1996-97]]), [[Edmonton Oilers]] ([[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98]]), [[Florida Panthers]] (1997-98 to [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01]]), [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] (2000-01 to [[2002-03 NHL season|2002-03]]), and [[Detroit Red Wings]] ([[2003-04 NHL season|2003-04]]). On August 6, 2005 Whitney signed a 2 year contract with the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL's Eastern Conference paying him $1.5 million per year. Ray is one of only 29 players in NHL history to record an overtime game-winner in a seventh game in the playoffs.  He did that in 1995 in a seventh game against the Calgary Flames while with San Jose.

As well as playing in the NHL, Ray has also played in the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL), [[International Hockey League]] (IHL), and [[American Hockey League]] (AHL).

In 2006, Ray helped Carolina win their first [[Stanley Cup]] with fellow Fort Saskatchewan native [[Mike Commodore]]. Ray stated that if the Hurricanes were not in the playoffs, he would have been rooting for the Oilers, as they were his childhood team. The Finals were a real emotional time for Ray and his father Floyd. Floyd stated that the Stanley Cup Finals were one of the hardest two weeks of his life. Being a guard for the Oilers dressing room and their practice goalie, Floyd had to chose between the team he worked with and his son. In the end, Floyd felt sorry for the Oilers but not too sorry, he was happy for his son.
