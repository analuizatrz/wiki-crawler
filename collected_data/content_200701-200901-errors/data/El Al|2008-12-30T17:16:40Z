'''El Al''' ({{lang-he|אל על}}, ''skyward'') ([[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange|TASE]]: [http://www.tase.co.il/TASEEng/General/Company/companyDetails.htm?companyId=001152 ELAL]) is the [[national airline]] of [[Israel]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.galbithink.org/topics/ka/priv.htm | title=Divestiture of Flag Carriers | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Galbi Think}}</ref><ref name="antimissiles">{{citeweb | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=683390&contrassID=1&subContrassID=5 | title=El Al Airlines installs anti-missile systems on passenger aircraft| accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Haaretz|quote=El Al, Israel's national carrier and largest airline|date=2006-02-15}}</ref> It operates regular international passenger and cargo flights between its [[Airline hub|hub]] at [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and destinations in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, as well as domestic connections to [[Eilat]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/FlightInfo/FlightSchedule/ | title=El Al Flight Schedule | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher= El Al}}</ref>

Since its inaugural flight from Geneva to Tel Aviv in September 1948 the airline has grown to serve 48 destinations on four continents.<ref name="History of El Al">{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/AboutElAl/ | title=History of El Al | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref> As the former national carrier of Israel, El Al has played an important role in Israel's humanitarian rescue efforts, airlifting Jews from [[Ethiopia]], [[Yemen]], and other countries where their lives were at risk.  The airline holds the world record for the most passengers on a commercial aircraft, a record set by [[Operation Solomon]] when Jewish refugees were transported from Ethiopia. El Al is widely acknowledged as the world's most secure airline, after foiling many attempted hijackings and terror attacks through its security protocols.<ref>{{cite web| title=El Al secure because it must be| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/07/04/el.al.security/| publisher=CNN| date=2002-07-05| accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/10/01/elal-usat.htm | title= Unfriendly skies are no match for El Al| publisher=USA Today |date=2001-01-10|last=Walt|first=Vivienne| accessdate=2007-04-29 }}</ref>

== History ==
=== Early years ===
[[Image:El Al Connie.jpg|thumb|right|El Al [[Lockheed Constellation]], 1951]]

In September 1948 [[Israel]]'s first [[President of Israel|president]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], attended a conference in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.  Weizmann was scheduled to fly back to Israel in a government aircraft<!--Swiss government?-->, but due to an embargo imposed on Israel at the time, this was not possible. A [[C-54]] military transport aircraft was instead converted into a civilian plane to transport Weizmann home. The aircraft was painted with the '''El Al/Israel National Aviation Company''' logo and fitted with extra fuel tanks to enable a non-stop flight from Geneva to Israel. It departed from [[Tel Nof Israeli Air Force Base|Ekron Air Base]] on 28 September, and returned to Israel on 30 September. After the flight, the aircraft was repainted and returned to military use.<ref name="answers">{{citeweb | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/el-al-israel-airlines-ltd | title=El Al Company History | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Answers.com Premium Partner}}</ref>

The airline was incorporated and became Israel's official carrier on 15 November 1948, although it used borrowed aircraft until February 1949, when two unpressurized [[DC-4]]s were purchased from [[American Airlines]]. The acquisition was funded by the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]], the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]], and other Jewish organizations. The first plane arrived at [[Ben Gurion International Airport|Lod Airport]] on 3 April 1949. Aryeh Pincus, a lawyer from South Africa, was elected head of the company. The first international flight, from [[Tel Aviv]] to Paris (refueling in Rome), took place on 31 July 1949.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13400/edition_id/259/format/html/displaystory.html | title=El Al flies to rescue throughout the world | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Jewish News Weekly of Northern California|last=Kanon|first=Sharon|date=2000-04-07}}</ref><ref name="answers" /> By the end of 1949, the airline had flown passengers to London and [[Johannesburg]]. A regular service to London was inaugurated in the middle of 1950.  Later that year, El Al acquired Universal Airways, which was owned by South African Zionists. A state-run domestic airline, [[Arkia Israel Airlines|Israel Inland Airlines]], was founded in which El Al had a 50% stake.<!--when?--><ref name="answers" />

El Al's cargo service was inaugurated in 1950 and initially relied on military surplus [[C-46]] aircraft. The same year the airline initiated charter services to the USA, followed by scheduled flights soon afterwards.<ref name="answers" /> From its earliest days the operation of the airline in keeping with Jewish tradition has been a source of friction; when the Israeli prime minister [[David Ben Gurion]] was forming his first coalition, the religious parties would not join unless Ben Gurion promised that El Al would serve only [[kosher]] food on its flights and would not fly on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]].<ref name="shabbat">{{citeweb | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010222124207/http://www.jewishgates.org/history/modhis/elal.stm | title=El-Al, Israel's Airline | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Gates of Jewish Heritage}}</ref>
[[Image:El Al ocean ad.png|thumb|El Al's 1958 advert promoting non-stop transatlantic services]]

As the national carrier, the airline was involved in several covert operations.<!--that doesn't necessarily follow--> In the early 1950s, El Al airlifted over 160,000 immigrants to Israel from [[History of the Jews in India|India]], [[History of the Jews in Iran|Iran]], [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemen]] as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]] and [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]].<ref name="History of El Al" />  In 1960, [[Nazi]] war criminal [[Adolf Eichmann]] was captured and flown from Argentina to Israel on an El Al aircraft.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874118-2,00.html | title=The Beast in Chains | publisher=Time Magazine | date=1960-06-06| accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

In 1955, after using [[Lockheed Constellation]]s for several years, the airline purchased two [[Bristol Britannia]] aircraft. El Al was the second airline in the world to fly this plane, after the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]]. In 1958, El Al ran a newspaper advertisement in the US featuring a picture of a "shrunken" Atlantic Ocean ("Starting Dec. 23, the Atlantic Ocean will be 20% smaller") to promote its non-stop [[transatlantic]] flights.<REF>{{cite news| url=http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:uff0IpxEuXsJ:www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937575,00.html%3Fiid%3Dchix-sphere+%22el+al%22+advertisement+1958&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=8&client=firefox-a | title=Adman's Adman | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=Time Magazine| date=1958-03-31}}</ref> This was a bold step: the airline industry had never used images of the ocean in its advertising because of the widespread public fear of airline crashes. The advertisement, which ran only once, proved effective. Within a year, El Al's sales tripled.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/weirtz/doyle.htm | title=Doyle Dane Bernbach | accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

=== Expansion in the 1960s ===
Despite the purchase of its Britannias and inauguration of non-stop transatlantic flights the airline remained unprofitable.<!--we didn't know it was unprofitable before--><ref name="answers" /> When Efraim Ben-Arzi took over the company in the late 1950s, the Britannias were replaced by [[de Havilland Comet|de Havilland Comet 4]], [[Boeing 707]], and [[Douglas DC-8]] jets. The first year that El Al turned a profit was 1960. That year, more than 50 percent of the passengers flying into Israel arrived on El Al flights.<ref name="answers" /> On 15 June 1961, the airline set a world record for the longest non-stop commercial flight: an El Al [[Boeing 707]] flew from Tel Aviv to New York, covering {{convert|5760|mi|km|0}} in 9 hours and 33 minutes.<ref name="History of El Al" />
By this time El Al was carrying 56,000 passengers a year&nbsp;— on a par with [[Qantas]] and ahead of established airlines like [[Loftleidir]]. In 1961, El Al ranked 35th in the world in the number of accumulated passenger miles.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Commercial_Aviation/ElAl/Tran25.htm | title=El Al, the Israeli Airline | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=US Centennial of Flight}}</ref>
El Al's success continued into the late 1960s. In 1968, regular flights to [[Bucharest]] were inaugurated, and cargo flights began to Europe and the USA. The airline also established a catering subsidiary, Teshet Tourism and Aviation Services Ltd. All these ventures brought in a profit of $2 million that year.<ref name="answers" />

=== Hijacking ===
In 1968, El Al experienced the first of many acts against the airline. On 23 July, the only successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place, when a 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers was taken over by three members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP). The aircraft was en route from Rome to [[Lod]]. The hijackers diverted it to [[Algiers]]. Bargaining with the hijackers went on for 40 days. Both the hijackers and the passengers, including 21 Israeli hostages, were eventually freed.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942267-2,00.html | title=Drama of the Desert: The Week of the Hostages | date=1970-09-21|accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=TIME}}</ref> On 26 December of the same year, two PFLP members attacked an El Al aircraft at [[Athens International Airport|Athens Airport]], killing an Israeli mechanic.<ref name="TVNZ"/> The [[Israeli Defense Forces]] responded on 29 December with a night-time raid on Lebanon's [[Beirut Airport]], destroying 14 planes on the ground belonging to [[Middle East Airlines]], [[Trans Mediterranean Airways]] and [[Lebanese International Airways]].<REF>{{cite web

[[Image:El Al 707 at Zurich 1982.jpg|thumb|right|An El Al [[Boeing 707]] touches down at [[Zurich Airport]] in 1982]]

El Al acquired its first [[Boeing 747]] in 1971. Many felt it was a risky purchase,<!--who are those many?--> given the high cost of the plane and fear of attacks, but El Al operations flourished after the purchase. Another 747 was delivered in 1973 and was used to inaugurate non-stop service from Tel Aviv to New York. In the air for 13 hours, and flying against prevailing winds, it was recorded as the longest commercial flight in the world.<!--presumably been overtaken now?--><ref name="answers" />

In the mid-1970s, El Al began to schedule flights from airports outside of Israel that departed on the [[Shabbat|Jewish sabbath]] and landed in Israel after it had finished. The religious parties in the government claimed that this was a violation of Jewish law and contrary to the agreement signed in the early days of the state, in which El Al promised to refrain from flying on the sabbath. In 1981, the newly re-elected prime minister [[Menachem Begin]], promised to abide by the agreement. Outraged, the secular community threatened to boycott the airline. In August 1982, El Al workers blocked Orthodox and Hassidic Jews from entering the airport.<ref name="shabbat" />

In 1977, El Al established a charter subsidiary then known as El Al Charter Services Ltd., but later renamed [[Sun D'Or|Sun D'Or International Airlines Ltd]]. Two years earlier, the airline had suffered its first losses since the late 1950s, largely a product of the global recession. The management changed three times towards the end of the 1970s, until Itzhak Shander was named president.<!--until? It changes again in 1982. This could be explained better--> As the political situation in Iran deteriorated, El Al began to airlift Jews to Israel. All the airline's infrastructure in Iran was eventually destroyed.<ref name="answers" />
El Al flights to [[Cairo]] were inaugurated in April 1980, following the [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]].<ref name="History of El Al" />  In late 1982, after a long period of labor disputes and strikes, El Al operations were suspended. The government appointed Amram Blum to run the company, which lost $123.3 million in the fiscal year ending April 1983.<!--appointed before or after the loss?--><ref name="answers" /> The airline also sold its stake in [[Arkia]] at this time.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/sde_dov.htm | title=Sde Dov/Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Global Security}}</ref>

Operations resumed in January 1983 under [[receivership]]. The government purchased two new [[Boeing 737]] aircraft and announced plans to acquire four [[Boeing 767]] jets at the cost of $200 million. Within four years, El Al was profitable again.<ref name="answers" /> It broke another record, since then surpassed, in May 1988 with a non-stop flight from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv, a journey of {{convert|7000|nmi|km|-2}} in 13 hours and 41 minutes.<!--what was the record? longest flight? quickest flight?--><ref name="History of El Al" /> Flights to Poland and Yugoslavia were inaugurated in 1989.<ref name="answers" />

=== 1990s and early 2000s ===
[[Image:elal.b747.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|El Al operated Boeing 747-200's between the 1970s and 1990s, now using the aircraft to transport cargo]]

In January 1990, [[North American Airlines]] began providing [[feeder service]]s in the US to El Al [[aviation gateway|gateways]]. El Al held a 24.9 percent stake in the airline until selling it back to Dan McKinnon in July 2003. By this time, El Al was operating a fleet of 20 aircraft, including nine Boeing 747s, and had begun replacing its aging Boeing 707s with the [[Boeing 757]]. Early that year, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, El Al inaugurated regular flights to Moscow. No airlifts from the former Soviet Union were possible at the time but permission was granted in 1991. Charter flights commenced in August 1991, with immigrants also occupying all available seats on El Al's scheduled routes. In cooperation with [[Aeroflot]], El Al flew  more than 400,000 Jewish immigrants to Israel within a three year period.

On 27 April 1994 El Al got its first [[Boeing 747-400]]. <ref name="answers" /><ref>

On 24 May 1991, an El Al [[Boeing 747]] cargo plane airlifted a record-breaking 1,087 [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] from [[Addis Ababa]] to Israel in the framework of [[Operation Solomon]].

El Al flights were inaugurated to the [[Far East]] and, in 1995, El Al signed its first [[codesharing agreement]] with [[American Airlines]].<ref name="answers" /> In February 1995, the receivership under which the airline had technically been operating since 1982 came to an end.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/3508/edition_id/62/format/html/displaystory.html | title=El Al Airlines posts $15 million profits | accessdate=2007-05-07| date=1996-04-26 | publisher=Jewish Bulletin Online}}</ref> In June 1996, El Al recorded another milestone: its first flight from Israel to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]].<ref name="History of El Al" />

[[Image:Operation Solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian Jews board an El Al aircraft during Operation Solomon]]

In 1996, El Al recorded $83.1 million in losses, due to the resumption of terrorist activities and the government's open-skies policy.<ref name="answers" /> To keep its planes flying during this period, El Al introduced flights "to nowhere": passengers were offered various kinds of in-flight entertainment as the plane circled the Mediterranean. One-day shopping trips to London and visits to religious sites in eastern Europe were also promoted.<ref name="answers" />

In 1997, El Al opened a separate cargo division.<!--it already had one, didn't it?--><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/ELALCargo/ | title=El Al Cargo Profile | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref> El Al's first [[Boeing 777]] embarked on its maiden flight in March 2000. Later that year the controversy over flights on Shabbat erupted again, when the airline announced that it was losing $55 million a year by grounding its planes on Saturdays. After the first phase of the long-delayed privatization of the company commenced in June 2003 and 15 percent of El Al's shares were listed on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]] the policy regarding sabbath flights was expected to change.<ref name="History of El Al" /><ref name="shabbat" />

In 2004 Knafaim-Arkia Holdings, the parent company of [[Arkia Israel Airlines]], acquired a large stake in Arkia and intended to seek full  ownership.<ref name="History of El Al" /><ref name="shabbat" /> However, due to Israeli anti-trust laws, Knafaim-Arkia was forced to sell its shares.<!--explain what relevance this has.

== Air Traffic Control ==
Unlike other countries where airlines can speak to Air Traffic Control in their native language, El Al pilots are required to speak to Air Traffic Controllers in [[English language|English]] at all times, regardless of the situation. This includes speaking to controllers in [[Tel Aviv]].

== El Al security ==
As a target for many decades, El Al employs stringent security procedures, both on the ground and on board its aircraft. These effective, though sometimes controversial, procedures have won El Al a reputation for security.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/10/01/elal-usat.htm | title=

=== Airport security measures ===
Passengers are asked to report three hours before departure. All El Al terminals around the world are closely monitored for security. There are plain-clothes agents and fully armed police or military personnel who patrol the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Inside the terminal, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats. Passengers will be asked questions about where they are coming from, the reason for their trip, their job or occupation, and whether they have packed their bags themselves. The likelihood of potential terrorists remaining calm under such questioning is believed to be low  (see also ''[[Microexpression]]'').<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2001/09/12/israelisecurity.htm | title=Israeli-style security might have averted hijackings | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=USA Today| date=2001-09-13}}</ref>
At the [[check-in]] counter the passengers' [[passport]]s and [[Airline ticket|ticket]]s are closely examined. A ticket without a sticker from the security checkers will not be accepted. At passport control passengers' names are checked against information from the [[FBI]], [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS), [[Scotland Yard]], [[Shin Bet]], and [[Interpol]] databases. Luggage is screened and sometimes hand searched. In addition, bags are put through a decompression chamber simulating pressures during flight that could trigger explosives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.segl.com/xj.php | title=El Al Decompression Chamber | accessdate=2006-07-18 | publisher=Simcoe Engineering Group Limited}}</ref> El Al is the only airline in the world that passes all luggage through such a chamber.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israelinsider.com/channels/security/articles/sec_0108.htm | title=El Al's legendary security measures set industry standards | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=[[Israel Insider]] | date=2001-10-03}}</ref> Even at overseas airports, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, even if they are supervised by government or private security firms.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2006-05-12-el-al-security_x.htm | title=El Al wants to do own bag screening at Newark | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=USA Today | date=2006-05-12}}</ref>

=== Flight security measures ===
[[Undercover]] agents (sometimes referred to as [[sky marshal]]s) carrying concealed firearms sit among the passengers on every international El Al flight.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2097352.stm | title=El Al sets security standards | date=2002-07-05| accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Most El Al pilots are former [[Israeli Air Force]] pilots. <ref name="Security">{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/09/26/rec.el.al.security | title=Model for air travel security may be El Al | date=2001-09-26| accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=CNN}}</ref>

[[Image:Elal.b777-200.4x-ecd.arp.jpg|thumb|El Al Boeing 777]]

The cockpits in all El Al aircraft have double doors to prevent entry by unauthorized persons. A [[password|code]] is required to access the doors, and the second door will only be opened after the first has closed and the person has been identified by the [[Captain (civil aviation)|Captain]] or [[First Officer]].<ref name="Security" /> Furthermore, there are reinforced [[steel]] floors separating the [[passenger]] [[cabin (aircraft)|cabin]] from the [[baggage]] hold.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10396216 | title=Flying under the eagle eyes of El Al's famed high security | accessdate=2006-08-15 | publisher=New Zealand Herald|last=Silver |first=Eric| date=2006-08-15}}</ref> This is intended to strengthen the plane in case of an explosion.

Following an attempt to shoot down an Israeli airliner in 2002,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2552097.stm|title=Kenyan police find Mombasa missiles|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2002-12-06}}</ref> all aircraft in the fleet have been equipped with an [[infrared countermeasures]] system called '[[Flight Guard]]', developed by [[Israeli Aerospace Industries]] to defend them against [[anti-aircraft missile]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vause|first=John|title=Missile defense for El Al fleet|publisher=[[CNN]]|date= 24 May 2004|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/24/air.defense/|accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=WILLIAMS|first=DAN|title=El Al Fits Fleet with Anti-Missile System|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=02/16/06 18:10|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1540304&C=airwar|accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iai.co.il/Default.aspx?docID=25873&FolderID=28973&lang=en&PageNum=3|title=IAI/Elta's "Flight Guard" Commercial Aircraft Protection System Funded|date=2003-09-08|publisher=[[Israeli Aerospace Industries]]}}</ref>  Although comparable systems such as [[CAMPS]] are now available for civilian aircraft, there is no information to date about any other airlines deploying such a system. Switzerland and other European countries have expressed concern that [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]] dropped by the Israeli system could cause fires in the vicinity of an airport.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3221013,00.html | title=Europe objects to El Al's anti-missile shield | accessdate=2006-11-12 | last=Beck | first=Eldad| date=2006-02-26| publisher=[[Ynetnews]]}}</ref>  However none of the higher risk countries that El Al aircraft fly to have raised any concerns.

=== Security controversy and passenger profiling ===
Critics of El Al note that its security checks on passengers include racial profiling<ref name="ArabReport">{{cite web | url=http://www.no-racism.org/arabic/data/publications/AirportReportEnglish.pdf |format=PDF| title=Suspected Citizens: Racial Profiling Against Arab Passengers by Israeli Airlines and Airports | last=Tarek |first=Ibrahim|year=2006| month=December |accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> and have argued that such profiling is unfair, irrational, and degrading to those subject to such screening.  Supporters of El Al argue that there is nothing inherently racist about passenger profiling and that special scrutiny of Muslims may often be necessary for security purposes.

The airline was also criticised by the Hungarian courts for refusing to search luggage with the passenger present, acting against Hungarian domestic laws which stipulate that only authorized officials are able to undertake such searches.<Ref name="ArabReport"/> A civil case was brought to [[Supreme Court of Israel]] on 19 March 2008 alleging that El Al's practice of ethnic profiling singles out Arabs for tougher treatment.<ref>[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8VGOUA00&show_article=1 Israeli Airport Security Challenged]</ref>

== Destinations ==
{{further|[[El Al destinations]]}}

El Al serves destinations on four continents with a well-developed European network that also takes in important cities in Russia, the Baltic region and CIS member states. The airline serves a number of gateway cities in North America and has expanded its service to cover central and southeast Asia and the Far East while retaining its limited coverage of Africa.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.airlineroutemaps.com/West_Asia/El_Al_europe.shtml | title=El Al European Route Map|accessdate=2007-05-07|publisher=Airline Route Maps}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.airlineroutemaps.com/West_Asia/El_Al_international.shtml|title=El Al Worldwide Route Map|accessdate=2007-05-07|publisher=Airline Route Maps}}</ref>
El Al service to its African and Asian destinations is complicated by the on-going refusal of neighbouring Arab nations, most importantly Saudi Arabia, to grant the Israeli flag carrier over-flight permission. The necessary re-routing of long-haul flights thus adds as much as ninety minutes to overall journey times. In recent years, this situation has seen improvements in the wake of bilateral air transport agreements concluded with Cyprus, Egypt and Jordan. Egypt is the only majority Muslim countries to which El Al provides passanger service [[Cairo Airport|(Cairo Airport)]] (it also provides service to [[Almaty Airport]] in [[Kazakhstan]], but only for cargo). In late 2007, the airline announced plans to launch service to Tokyo, Shanghai and one or two South American cities.<ref>{{citeweb | url=www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=2&cid=1195036615394&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |title=Up, up and away | publisher=Jerusalem Post | date=2007-11-15 | accessdate-2007-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/DocView.asp?did=1000269411&fid=1725 | title=El Al applies for northern flights | date=2007-10-30 | publisher=Globes | accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref>.

As of December 2008, the El Al network reached a total of 44 destinations including 31 in Europe, 7 in Asia, 4 in North America and 2 in Africa.

=== Fleet expansion ===
El Al currently have the following aircraft on order:
*4 [[Boeing 737-800]] aircraft to be leased for delivery in summer 2008 to early 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000311735&fid=1725 | title=El Al adds 3 new planes | date=2008-02-19 | work=Globes | accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref>
*4 [[Boeing 777-200ER]] aircraft for delivery between 2009 to 2012.

El Al will soon withdraw its last non-ER 767-200. (4X-EAA)

There is speculation over the airline acquiring the following aircraft:
*In May 2007, it was announced that El Al reached an agreement to lease six or seven aircraft from [[Boeing]] between 2011 and 2015 after canceling its option to buy eight [[Boeing 787]] aircraft. It is unclear what model these aircraft will be.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/DocView.asp?did=1000208163&fid=1725 | title=El Al, Boeing close to plane lease deal for 2011-15 | publisher=Globes | last=Tal| first=Dalia | date=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>
*In July 2007, it was announced that the airline had re-entered negotiations to purchase two 787s.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/DocView.asp?did=1000229503&fid=1725 | title=El Al to buy 2 Boeing 787s | date=2007-07-08 | accessdate=2007-07-09 | publisher=Globes | last=Tal | first=Dalia}}</ref> Boeing is trying to resurrect the 787 deal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1192380803707&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull| title=Boeing to El Al: Revive Dreamliner purchase plans| author=Jonathan Ferziger, Bloomberg| publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]| date=13 November 2007| accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref>
*Despite having talks with [[Airbus]] over aircraft, El Al stated in early 2008 that it plans to rationalize its long-haul aircraft around the 777 or 787. Having said this, CEO Haim Romano did not rule out the A350, saying that they would consider it if Airbus came up with "the right proposition."<ref name="flight int"/>  But the airline is under big pressure from the American government to buy airplanes from the American company Boeing.

== Matmid ==
Matmid is El Al's [[frequent flyer program]]. It was launched in 2004 following the merger of El Al's previous frequent flyer programs. Matmid has four tiers: Matmid, Matmid Silver, Matmid Gold, and Matmid Platinum.  Points accumulated in the program entitle members to bonus tickets, flight upgrades, and discounts on car rentals, hotel stays, and other products and services. Points are also awarded for travel with partner airlines, as well as for nights at partner hotels and for credit card purchases.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.superstar.de/flyer/News/New%20Matmid%20Club%20Broschure.pdf |format=PDF| title=Matmid Club | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Superstar Travel}}</ref>

=== Partnerships ===
Matmid points can be collected on most flights operated by:<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/MatmidFrequentFlyer/BenefitsFromELALPartners/Airlines/AeroMexico.htm | title=El Al Partner Airlines | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref>

*[[American Airlines]] and [[American Eagle Airlines|American Eagle]]
*[[South African Airways]]
*[[Sun D'Or]]
*[[Qantas]]

Some flights operated by the following airlines qualify for points:

*[[Aeroméxico]] flights from Madrid, Miami, New York, and Paris, to Mexico City

Points can also be collected on El Al's [[El Al#Codeshare agreements|codeshare]] flights.

== King David Lounge ==
[[Image:BGN LY King David Lounge birdseyeview.jpg|thumb|King David Lounge at Ben Gurion International Airport]]
The [[King David Lounge]] is the name adopted by El Al for special airport lounges, which serve the airline's premium class passengers. In total, there are five King David Lounges worldwide at key airports such as Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion, Paris-CDG, New York City-JFK International, London-Heathrow, and Los Angeles-International.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/MatmidFrequentFlyer/AboutTheClub/KingDavidClub.htm | title=El Al King David Lounge | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref>

All King David Lounges offer drinks, snacks, newspapers and magazines (Israeli and foreign), while some lounges also offer free [[Wi-Fi]] internet access. The King David Lounge at Terminal 3 at Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion airport has a separate section for first-class passengers, eqipped with telephone and shower facilities and a spa.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/AllAboutYourFlight/PremiumClasses/FirstClass/kingDavidLounge.htm | title=El Al King David Lounge Spa | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref>

== Codeshare agreements ==
As of July 2008, El Al has the following [[codeshare]] partners:<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.elal.co.il/elal/english/aboutelal/codeshare|title=El Al Codeshare Partners|accessdate=2007-05-07|publisher=El Al}}</ref>

It was announced in December 2007, that El Al would start a large code-sharing agreement with American Airlines in early 2008 following the cancellation of codeshare agreements between Delta and El Al as a result of Delta's launch of non-stop service between New York (JFK) and Tel Aviv, competing directly with El Al.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://news.cheapflights.com/airlines/2007/12/american-airlin.html |  title=American Airlines code share to open up Israel | publisher=Cheapflights | accessdate=2007-12-05 | date=2007-12-05}}</ref>

== Cargo ==

El Al has a cargo branch, El Al Cargo, which became independent in 1997. As the national cargo airline of Israel, it operates to destinations in Asia, Europe and North America. Before 2001, when the Israeli air cargo market opened up to competition, El Al Cargo enjoyed a monopoly. Now its main competition comes from [[CAL Cargo Air Lines]].<ref name="answers" />

== Livery ==
El Al's historic, superseded livery featured a turquoise/navy blue stripe down the side of the aircraft, and a turquoise tailfin with the flag of Israel at the top. El Al's logo was featured above the front run of windows on each side of the plane in the turquoise/navy scheme.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.airliners.net/open.file?id=1166039&WxsIERv=Obrvat%20757-258&Wm=0&WdsYXMg=Ry%20Ny%20Vfenry%20Nveyvarf&QtODMg=Zvyna%20-%20Znycrafn%20%28ZKC%20%2F%20YVZP%29&ERDLTkt=Vgnyl&ktODMp=Qrprzore%2024%2C%202006&BP=0&WNEb25u=Raevpb%20Cvreboba%20FcbgVG&xsIERvdWdsY=4K-ROG&MgTUQtODMgKE=&YXMgTUQtODMgKERD=973&NEb25uZWxs=2007-01-22%2021%3A01%3A02&ODJ9dvCE=&O89Dcjdg=25036%2F356&static=yes&width=1024&height=694&sok=JURER%20%20%28nvepensg_trarevp%20YVXR%20%27Obrvat%20757%25%27%29%20NAQ%20%28nveyvar%20YVXR%20%27Ry%20Ny%20Vfenry%20Nveyvarf%25%27%29%20%20BEQRE%20OL%20cubgb_vq%20QRFP&photo_nr=10&prev_id=1174285&next_id=1164049 | title=El Al Superseded Livery | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Airliners.net}}</ref> The new livery features a blue stripe with a thick silver border on the bottom that sweeps across the side of the aircraft near the wing, disappears over the top of the plane and reappears at the bottom of the tailfin. The El Al logo is part of the design, although it has been changed slightly since then.<!--and when would then be?--><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.airliners.net/open.file?id=1206451&WxsIERv=Obrvat%20777-258%2FRE&Wm=0&WdsYXMg=Ry%20Ny%20Vfenry%20Nveyvarf&QtODMg=Ybf%20Natryrf%20-%20Vagreangvbany%20%28YNK%20%2F%20XYNK%29&ERDLTkt=HFN%20-%20Pnyvsbeavn&ktODMp=Sroehnel%204%2C%202007&BP=1&WNEb25u=Fabeer%20-%20INC&xsIERvdWdsY=4K-RPP&MgTUQtODMgKE=&YXMgTUQtODMgKERD=732&NEb25uZWxs=2007-05-05%2023%3A30%3A37&ODJ9dvCE=&O89Dcjdg=30833%2F335&static=yes&width=1000&height=678&sok=JURER%20%20%28nveyvar%20%3D%20%27Ry%20Ny%20Vfenry%20Nveyvarf%27%29%20%20BEQRE%20OL%20cubgb_vq%20QRFP&photo_nr=2&prev_id=1206782&next_id=1205415 | title=El Al New Livery | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Airliners.net}}</ref>

*On 23 July 1968, El Al flight 426 operated by a [[Boeing 707]] on route from London to [[Tel Aviv]] via Rome, was hijacked by three members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] shortly after take-off from Rome-[[Leonardo da Vinci Airport|Fiumicino]] airport and forcefully diverted to [[Algiers]]. The hijacking ended after 40 days and is considered to be the only successful hijacking involving an El Al jet.

*In February, 1969, an El Al Boeing 707 was attacked at [[Zürich]] airport. An Israeli trainee pilot was killed, with another eight people being wounded. In a firefight involving security personnel, one terrorist was killed, while the others were arrested. The terrorists were later put on trial in Winterthur / Switzerland but released following the hijacking of a Swissair aircraft one year later.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.idéesuisse.ch/252.0.html?&no_cache=1&L=0&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1636&tx_ttnews%5Blist%5D=182%2C267%2C87%2C1636%2C509 | title=El Al hijack | accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>

*Another terrorist attack was foiled on 18 April 1986 in what became known as the [[Hindawi Affair]]. A pregnant Irish woman named [[Anne Mary Murphy]] was about to board an El Al flight at London's Heathrow airport when her bag was found to contain three pounds of plastic explosives. These had been planted by her fiancé [[Nezar Hindawi]] who was booked on a different flight. Hindawi was jailed for 45 years, the longest sentence ever delivered by a British court.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article493799.ece | title=El Al bomber too dangerous to release, court rules| publisher=Times Online|date=2004-10-13|last=Booth|first=Jenny|quote=His sentence of 45 years is believed to be the longest specific jail term ever imposed by an English court.|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> There was evidence that [[Syria]]n officials were involved and as a result, Britain cut off diplomatic relations with Syria.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/1064 | title=Terrorism: The Syrian Connection | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Daniel Pipes}}</ref>

Situated in [[Bijlmermeer]], a neighborhood of Amsterdam. The crash was caused by an engine detaching from the aircraft, knocking a second engine off the aircraft as well. The three crew members, one passenger, and 39 people on the ground were killed.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19921004-2 | title=Accident description El Al 1862 | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Aviation Safety}}</ref>

*On 23 October 2003, an El Al Boeing 767 flying from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles via Toronto was diverted to [[Montreal-Mirabel International Airport]] and onward to [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], where [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] tactical teams were on the ready. The diversion was the result of a "grave security threat", possibly a planned [[surface-to-air missile]] attack on the aircraft upon landing in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/10/26/pearson_elal031026.html | title=Israeli Flight Lands in Toronto| accessdate=2008-03-11 | publisher=CBC News| date=2003-10-27}}</ref>
