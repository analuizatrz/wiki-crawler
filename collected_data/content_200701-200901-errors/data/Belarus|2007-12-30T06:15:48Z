Until the 20th century, the [[Belarusians]] lacked the opportunity to form their national policy<!--do you mean "evolve a distinctive national identity, since the lands of modern-day Belarus had been occupied by ..."?-->, as the lands of modern-day Belarus belonged to several countries, including the [[Duchy of Polatsk]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. After the short-lived [[Belarusian People's Republic]] (1918–19), Belarus became a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]], the [[Byelorussian SSR]].

The final unification of Belarusian lands within its modern borders took place in 1939, when the ethnically Belarusian lands that were part of [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] were annexed by the USSR and attached to the Soviet Belarus. The territory and its nation were devastated in [[World War II]], during which Belarus lost about a quarter of its population and more than half of its economic resources;<ref name="axell">{{cite book | last = Axell | first = Albert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Russia's Heroes, 1941–45 | publisher = Carroll & Graf Publishers | date= 2002 | location = | pages = 247 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 078671011X }}</ref> the republic recovered<!--"recovered" sounds too cut-and-dried: it remained economically impoverished under the Soviet system, yes?

The parliament of the republic declared the sovereignty of Belarus on [[July 27]], [[1990]], and following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], Belarus declared independence on [[August 25]], [[1991]]. [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president since 1994. During his presidency, Lukashenko has implemented<!--retained?--> Soviet-era policies, such as state ownership of the economy, despite objections from Western governments. Since 1996, Belarus is negotiating with Russia to unify into a single state called the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]].

Most of Belarus's population of 9.85&nbsp;million reside in the urban areas surrounding Minsk and other [[oblast]] (regional) capitals.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://un.by/en/aboutbelarus/population/ |title=About Belarus - Population |accessdate=2007-10-07 |date=2003 |publisher=United Nations Office in Belarus }}</ref> More than 80% of the population are native Belarusians, with sizable minorities of Russians, Ukrainians and Poles. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare an official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Belarus'' derives from the term ''[[White Russia]]'', which first appeared in German and Latin [[medieval]] literature. The Latin term for the area was ''Russia Alba''. Historically, the country was referred to in [[English language|English]] as ''White Russia''. It is also claimed by some people that the correct translation is ''White [[Ruthenia]]'' (''White Rus'' phonetically), which either describes the area of Eastern Europe populated by Slavic people or the states that occupied the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halgal.com/ruthenian.html |title=An Understanding of the Terms 'Ruthenia' and 'Ruthenians |accessdate=2007-03-18 |last=Bielawa |first=Matthew |date=2002 |work=Genealogy of Halychyna/Eastern Galicia }}</ref> The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]].<ref name="alies">{{cite book | last = Alies | first = Bely | title = The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name | publisher = Encyclopedix | date= 2000 | location = Minsk, Belarus | isbn = 985-6599-12-1 }}</ref> During the 17th century, Russian [[tsar]]s used ''White [[Ruthenia|Rus']]'', asserting that they were trying to recapture their heritage from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name="alies"/> 

Belarus was named ''Belorussia'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Белоруссия) in the days of [[Imperial Russia]], and the Russian tsar was usually styled ''Czar of [[Russia|All the Russias]]—[[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]]''. ''Belorussia'' was the only [[Russian language]] name of the country (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Belarus'' (Беларусь) in Russian and in all other language transcriptions of its name. The change was made to reflect adequately the [[Belarusian language]] form of the name.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm |title=Law of the Republic of Belarus - About the name of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=2007-10-06 |date=1991-09-19 |publisher=Pravo - Law of the Republic of Belarus |language=Russian }}</ref> Accordingly, the name ''Belorussia'' was replaced by ''Belarus'' in English, and, to some extent, in Russian (although the traditional name still persists in that language as well); likewise, the adjective ''Belorussian'' or ''Byelorussian'' was replaced by ''Belarusian'' in English (though Russian has not developed a new adjective). Some Belarusians object to the name ''Belorussia'' as an unwelcome reminder of the days under Russian and Soviet rule.<ref name='belorussia'> {{cite web|url=http://pravapis.org/art_belarusian_adjective.asp |title=Belarus: Belarusian and Belarusan the correct adjective forms |accessdate=2006-03-08 |last=Katkouski |first=Uladzimir |date=2003-02-03 |publisher=Pravapis.org }}</ref> However, most residents of the country do not mind it being called Byelorussiya in Russian (which is, actually, the most widely spoken language there) – it is evidenced by the fact that several popular newspapers published locally still retain the traditional name of the country in Russian in their names (e.g. Komsomolskaya Pravda v Byelorussii, which is the localised publication of a popular Russian tabloid, and Sovetskaya Byelorussiya). Officially, the full name of the country is ''Republic of Belarus'' (Рэспубліка Беларусь, Республика Беларусь, Respublika Byelarus').<ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html#Govt |title=Belarus - Government |accessdate=2007-12-22 |date=2007-12-13 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] }}</ref> {{Audio|Republic of Belarus.ogg|listen}}

During the negotiations of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], Belarus first declared independence on [[25 March]] [[1918]], forming the [[Belarusian National Republic|Belarusian People's Republic]].

Belarus has historically been a [[Russian Orthodox]] country, with minorities practicing [[Catholicism]], [[Judaism]], and other religions. Belarusians converted to the Russian Orthodox Church after Belarus was annexed by Russia after the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Belarus's Roman Catholic minority, which makes up perhaps 10% of the country's population and is concentrated in the western part of the country, especially around [[Hrodna]], is made up of a mixture of Belarusians and the country's [[Polish people|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] minorities. About 1% belong to the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]].<ref>Library of Congress Country Studies [http://countrystudies.us/belarus/20.htm Belarus - Religion].

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Belarus}}

Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th century religious writing; the 12th century poetry of [[Cyril of Turaw]] is representative.<ref name='bypoem'>{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/literature/Old_Poetry.html |title=Old Belarusian Poetry |accessdate=2007-10-09 |date=1994 |publisher=Virtual Guide to Belarus }}</ref> By the 16th century, [[Polotsk]] resident [[Francysk Skaryna]] translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in [[Prague]] and [[Vilnius]] between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe.<ref name="byeb">"Belarus." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. <http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-33482>.</ref> The modern period of Belarusian literature began in the late-19th century; one important writer was [[Yanka Kupala]]. Many notable Belarusian writers of the time, such as [[Uładzimir Žyłka]], Kazimir Svayak, [[Yakub Kolas]], [[Źmitrok Biadula]] and [[Maksim Haretski]], wrote for a Belarusian language paper called ''[[Nasha Niva]]'', published in Vilnius. After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. The free development of literature occurred only in Polish-held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939.<ref name="byeb"/> Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus, not to return until the 1960s.<ref name="byeb"/> The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by [[Vasil Bykaŭ]] and [[Uładzimir Karatkievič]].

The first major musical composition by a Belarusian was the opera ''[[Faust]]'' by [[Antoni Radziwiłł]]. In the 17th century, Polish composer [[Stanislau Maniushka]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vincent Dunin-Marcinkevich]] and created the opera ''Sielanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Bolshoi Ballet Theatre in Minsk.<ref>{{cite news | first=Crystal | last=Zou | coauthors= | title=Ballets for Christmas | date=2003-12-11 | publisher= | url =http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html | work =Shanghai Star | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-20 | language = }}</ref> After the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]], music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland.

The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the [[Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk]], which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as [[Independence Day]] and [[Victory Day (Eastern Europe)|Victory Day]], draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk.<ref name="festivals">{{cite web| url=http://www.belarusembassy.org/belarus/culture.htm| title=Belarusian National Culture| publisher=Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in the United States of America| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country.

The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus']] period. Because of the cool climate, clothes, usually composed of [[flax]] or [[wool]], were designed to keep the body warm. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns.<ref>Virtual Guide to Belarus [http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/clothing/index.html Belarusian traditional clothing].

[[Cuisine of Belarus|Belarusian cuisine]] consists mainly of vegetables, meat (especially pork), and breads. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. A typical Belarusian eats a very light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host presents an offering of bread salt when greeting a guest or visitor.<ref>Canadian Citizenship and Immigration - [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project - Eating the Belarusian Way].
