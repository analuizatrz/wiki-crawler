'''''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''''' was a US fantasy fiction magazine edited by [[H. L. Gold]] in the years 1953-1955.  Although it has generally been regarded as one of the best of the many new magazines launched in the 1950s, it was not a commercial success, and lasted only ten issues.

''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'''s first issue was dated July 1953.  The magazine was launched by Galaxy Publishing Corporation as a fantasy companion to the successful [[Galaxy Science Fiction]].  The first issue featured [[Theodore Sturgeon]], [[Damon Knight]] and [[Richard Matheson]].  The cover painting was by [[Richard Powers]]; Gold was one of the very few American magazine editors to use his work, though Powers was prolific in the paperback field.  The cover art was often [[Surrealism|Surrealist]], which was unusual for a genre magazine.  The magazine was planned by Gold as a companion to his more successful [[Galaxy Science Fiction]], which had started publishing in 1950.  The quality of the fiction remained high throughout the magazine's life, with appearances from many well-known authors, and the magazine is often cited as being the successor to the unusual fantasy tradition of [[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]].  An editorial by Gold in the first issue laid out the magazine's scope, which excluded, in his words, only "the probably possible" and "the unentertaining".<ref name=Clute_Grant>{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] & [[John Grant|Grant, John]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Fantasy| origdate= 1997| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 110}}</ref><ref name=issues>See the individual issues.</ref>

''Beyond'' published several significant or widely-reprinted stories during its short history.  These included:
* ". . . And My Fear Is Great . . .", by Theodore Sturgeon (July 1953).
* "The Wall Around the World", by [[Theodore R. Cogswell]] (September 1953).
* "Kid Stuff", by [[Isaac Asimov]] (September 1953).
* "The Watchful Poker Chip", by [[Ray Bradbury]] (March 1954).  Generally reprinted under the title "The Watchful Poker Chip of H. Matisse".
* "The Green Magician", by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]] (November 1954).  Part of the Incompleat Enchanter series.
* "Upon the Dull Earth", by [[Philip K. Dick]] (November 1954).

Other writers who appeared in the magazine included [[Jerome Bixby]], [[John Wyndham]], [[James Gunn (author)|James E. Gunn]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Frederik Pohl]], both under his own name, and also with [[Lester del Rey]] (under the joint pseudonym of "Charles Satterfield"), [[Philip José Farmer]], [[Randall Garrett]], [[Zenna Henderson]], and [[Algis Budrys]].

An unusual feature of the magazine was that every story included a facsimile of the author's signature, set at the end of the story.  The magazine carried almost no non-fiction, though there were occasional "filler" pieces, as was common in such magazines, to fill spaces at the end of stories.  There were no book reviews, and only the first issue carried an editorial.<ref name=issues>See the individual issues.</ref>

The magazine carried interior artwork for almost every story throughout its life, usually including multiple illustrations for each story.  The best-known interior artist ''Beyond'' used was [[Ed Emshwiller]], though there were several other regulars.<ref name=issues>See the individual issues.</ref>

==Bibliographic details==
The publisher was Galaxy Publishing Corporation, New York, throughout.  The magazine was initially titled "Beyond Fantasy Fiction", and this remained the title on the masthead throughout the ten-issue run.  However, issue 9 changed the title to simply "Beyond Fiction" on the cover, spine, and table of contents.  Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to "Beyond Fantasy Fiction" for the table of contents.  As a result the magazine is often listed as having changed its name for the last two issues.<ref name=issues>See the individual issues.</ref><ref name=Tuck>{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

The magazine began as a 160-page [[Digest size|digest]], priced at 35 cents.  The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954.  The magazine was bimonthly throughout, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways.  However, the masthead for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, and so they are now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates.  The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number.<ref name=Tuck /><ref name=issues>See the individual issues.</ref>

In addition to Richard Powers, covers were contributed by René Vidmer and Arthur Krusz, among others.<ref name=issues>See the individual issues.</ref>

A British edition of the magazine ran for four issues.  These copied the first four issues of the US version, with slightly cut contents; they were numbered 1 to 4.  They were not dated, but appeared on a bimonthly schedule starting in November 1953 and finishing in May 1954.<ref name=Clute_Grant /><ref name=Tuck />

Nine stories from the magazine were collected into the 160-page paperback ''Beyond'', published in 1963 by Berkley (F712), edited by Thomas Dardis (who was not credited on the book).<ref name=Clute_Grant />
