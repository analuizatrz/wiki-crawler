A '''comedian''', or '''comic''', is a performer who entertains an audience by making them laugh. This might be through [[joke]]s or amusing situations, or acting the fool, as in [[slapstick]], or employing [[prop comedy]]. A female comedian may be known as a '''comedienne''', although usage of this term has declined in recent years.
A comedian who stands and addresses an audience directly is called a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]].

Since the mid-[[1980s]], a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], has been gaining popularity and delighting audiences with its offbeat style. This normally involves more experiential, or observational, reporting to get a laugh. Famous comedians often overstep the mark of what the public perceive as acceptable, such as the remarks made by [[Billy Connolly]] about the killing of [[Ken Bigley]].

Formats of a comedian's show are flexible and often depend on the type of [[comedy]]. Some comedians like Brian Figarol speak about their own day to day lives, while others like [[Frank Skinner]] sing humorous songs.

As far as content is concerned, comedians such as [[Tommy Tiernan]] draw on their background to poke fun at themselves, while others such as [[Bill Hicks]] and [[George Carlin]] have strong political and cultural undertones.

Many comics achieve a [[cult]] following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career is made when they win a notable comedy prize, such as the now defunct [[Perrier Award]]. Comics typically survive by continuous touring and foray into other areas of entertainment, when they have become famous. These include [[television]] (such as with [[Carlos Mencia]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Ray Romano]], [[Pablo Francisco]] and [[Dave Chappelle]]), films (such as with [[Chris Rock]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Janeane Garofalo]] and [[Robin Williams]]), [[radio]] (such as with [[Dave Callan]], [[Adam Carolla]] more examples needed) and the release of [[DVD]]s of live shows.
