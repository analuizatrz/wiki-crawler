'''Frank Skinner''', (born '''Christopher Graham Collins''' on [[28 January]], [[1957]]) is an [[England|English]] [[writer]] and [[comedian]].

Born at [[Sandwell General Hospital]], [[West Bromwich]], Collins grew up in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]]. He attended Moat Farm Infant School from 1961 to 1964, St. Hubert's Roman Catholic Junior School from 1964 to 1968, and then [[Warley High School|Oldbury Technical Secondary School]] from September 1968. 

He passed 2 [[O-level]]s in the summer of 1973 and was allowed to take [[A-level]]s in English Language and Art, along with several O-level re-sits, at Oldbury Technical School Sixth Form. But he was caught embezzling the school meals service by selling cut-price meal vouchers to pupils and expelled just six weeks into his studies.

For several years he was known to the police after a series of minor offences including putting a length of pipe across a road and causing a car crash, although he never ended up in prison.

But he soon turned his life around by taking 4 A-levels (including English Language and Literature) at night school and then graduating from the Birmingham Polytechnic, now known as [[UCE Birmingham]] in [[1985]] with a degree in English Literature. After graduating, he spent four years as an English lecturer at [[Halesowen College]], whilst being a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] on the side, before quitting his job in 1989 to pursue his comedy career full-time. During this period he quit drinking due to [[influenza]] and remains one of the UK's most high-profile recovering [[alcoholic]]s.

Collins took on the pseudonym '''Frank Skinner''' when the actors' union [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] told him there was already someone of the same name on their books (their rules do not permit two members with identical names). He took the name from a member of his late father's [[dominoes]] team.

Skinner had performed his first stand-up gig in 1987 and made his [[television]] debut a year later. In 1990 he co-wrote and starred in a weakly-received [[sitcom]], ''[[Packet of Three (TV series)|Packet Of Three]]'', on [[Channel 4]] but continued to see his reputation as a stand-up grow. He won the 1991 [[Perrier Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], beating [[Jack Dee]] and [[Eddie Izzard]].

He often works with best friend and ex-flatmate [[David Baddiel]], notably on the popular late night entertainment show ''[[Fantasy Football League]]'', from 1994 to 2004 and on ''[[Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned]]'' from 2000 to 2005. 

The duo also co-wrote and performed the [[soccer|football]] song "[[Three Lions]]" with the [[Lightning Seeds]] and the [[England national football team]] for [[Euro 96]], and re-released it for the [[1998 World Cup]]. Both times the song reached #1 in the UK charts and it is widely regarded as the best of the English football anthems. 

From 1995 to 1998, Skinner had his own chat show on [[BBC]] One, and moved it to [[ITV]] in 1999, where it ran until late 2005. He has appeared in a number of self-written sitcoms, including ''[[Blue Heaven]]'' (1992) and ''[[Shane (UK TV series)|Shane]]'' (2004). In 2003, he was listed in [[The Observer]] as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. He has lived in London since the beginning of his comedy career in 1991, but still supports [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]] and [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]]. When West Bromwich Albion won promotion to the [[FA Premier League]] in 2004, he featured in an Express and Star article which commemorated the club's promotion.

In 2005, Skinner announced he was going to leave behind his television work in favour of returning to the stand-up comedy circuit. It was rumoured that ITV's decision not to offer him a new contract was the main driving force behind this decision. A second series of ''Shane'' has been made, but is lost amongst the wrangling. 

Skinner and David Baddiel covered the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] by podcast for ''[[The Times]]'', a British broadsheet.  Frank is currently learning to play the banjo for a celebrity reality show to be broadcast on the BBC in 2007, and will also executive produce a [[CBS]] pilot version of ''Shane''. A novel, rumoured to be called "Thunderman and Jeff Phillips" may also follow in 2007.

In February 2006, he received an [[honorary degree]] from the [[University of Central England in Birmingham|University of Central England]]. [http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/feb06/dr820203.php]

In 2007, he announced a new live stand-up tour, his first for 10 years. He will perform in venues around the UK and Ireland during September and October 2007.
