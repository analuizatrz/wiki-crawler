The '''Victoria Cross''' ('''VC''') is a [[military decoration]] awarded for valour "in the face of the enemy" to members of armed forces of some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and previous [[British Empire]] territories. It takes precedence over all other [[Post-nominal letters|postnominals]] and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any [[Military rank|rank]] in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] during an investiture held at [[Buckingham Palace]]. It is the joint highest award for bravery in the United Kingdom with the [[George Cross]], which is the equivalent honour for valour not ''in the face of the enemy.''<ref name=Modclub/>

The VC was introduced on [[5 February]] [[1856]] by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] to reward acts of valour during the [[Crimean War]]. Since then the medal has been awarded 1,356 times to 1,353 individual recipients. Only 14 medals have been awarded since the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The traditional explanation of the source of the [[gunmetal]] from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian [[cannon]] captured at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855)|siege of Sevastopol]]. Recent research has thrown doubt on this story, suggesting a variety of origins.<ref name=Glanfield/> Due to its rarity, the VC is highly prized and the medal can reach over [[Pound sterling|£]]200,000 at auction and there are a number of public and private collections devoted to it, most notably that of [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]], which contains over one-tenth of the total VCs awarded.<ref name=Ashcroftweb/>

== Origin == <!-- linked from Victoria Cross for New Zealand -->
In 1854, after 40 years of peace, Britain found itself fighting a major war against Russia. The [[Crimean War]] was one of the first wars with modern reporting, and the dispatches of [[William Howard Russell]] described many acts of bravery and valour by British servicemen that went unrewarded.<ref name=Ashcroft>Ashcroft, Michael, Preface to Victoria Cross Heroes</ref>  

Before the Crimean War, there was no official standardised system for recognition of gallantry within the British armed forces. Officers were eligible for an award of one of the junior grades of the [[Order of the Bath]] and [[Brevet rank|Brevet promotions]] whilst a [[Mention in Despatches]] existed as an alternative award for acts of lesser gallantry. This structure was actually very limited; in actual practice awards of the Order of the Bath were confined to officers of [[field officer|field rank]]<ref>'''Original Warrant Foreword''': ''{{lang|ang|And, whereas, the third class of Our Most Honourable Order of the Bath is limited, except in very rare cases, to the higher ranks of both services, and the granting of Medals, both in Our Navy and Army, is only awarded for long service or meritorious conduct, rather than for bravery in action or distinction before an enemy,}}''</ref> Brevet promotions or Mentions in Despatches were largely confined to those who were under the immediate notice of the commanders in the field, generally members of the commander's own staff.<ref>British Gallantry Awards, p283</ref>  

Other European countries had awards that did not discriminate against class or rank; [[France]] awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]] (Legion of Honour) and [[The Netherlands]] gave the [[Order of William]]. There was a growing feeling amongst the public and in the Royal Court that a new award was needed to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man's lengthy or meritorious service. Queen Victoria signed a Royal Warrant on [[29 January]] [[1856]]<ref name=Ashcroft/> that officially recognised the VC. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the [[Crimean War]].<ref>Ashcroft, Michael, p.7-10</ref>

[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] had instructed the [[War Office]] to strike a new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal was meant to be a simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services.<ref name=vvaa>{{cite web | url=http://www.vvaa.org.au/med-vc.htm| title=The Victoria Cross | work=Vietnam Veterans Of Australia| accessdate=2007-06-15 }}</ref> To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, under the guidance of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], vetoed the suggestion that the award be called ''The Military Order of Victoria'' and instead suggested the name ''Victoria Cross''. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion.<ref>'''Original Warrant, Clause 5''':''{{lang|ang|Fifthly. It is ordained that the Cross shall only be awarded to those officers and men who have served Us in the presence of the enemy, and shall have then performed some signal act of valour or devotion to their country.}}''</ref> The first ceremony was held on [[26 June]] [[1857]] where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.<ref name=Ashcroft/>

It was originally intended that the VCs would be cast from the [[bronze]] [[wikt:cascabel|cascabels]] of two [[cannon]]s that were captured from the [[Russia]]ns at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855)|siege of Sevastopol]].<ref name=beharry359/><ref name=Navalmuseum/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hancocks-london.com/vc_manufacture.htm| title=Hancocks of London History of VC | publisher=Hancocks of London | accessdate= 2007-06-24}}</ref> The historian John Glanfield has since proven through the use of x-rays of older Victoria Crosses that the metal used for VCs is in fact from antique Chinese guns and not of Russian origin.<ref name=Glanfield>{{Cite news |url=http://telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/28/nvc28.xml |title=Author explodes myth of the gunmetal VC |last=Davies |first=Catronia |publisher=[[The Telegraph]] |date=2005-12-28 |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref><ref name=Navalmuseum/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hancocks-london.com/vc_manufacture.htm| title=Hancocks of London history of VC |publisher=Hancocks of London |accessdate= 2007-06-24}}</ref> One theory is that the guns were originally Chinese weapons but the Russians captured them and reused them at Sevastopol. It was also thought that some medals made during the [[First World War]] were composed of metal captured from different Chinese guns during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] but the original metal was used after the war. It is also believed that another source of metal was used between 1942 and 1945 to create five [[Second World War]] VCs when the Sevastopol metal went missing.<ref name=Glanfield/> 

The barrels of the cannon in question are stationed outside the Officers' Mess at the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] at [[Woolwich]]. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 358 oz (10 kg), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment [[Royal Logistic Corps]] at [[Donnington, Telford]]. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, [[Hancocks]] of London, has been responsible for the production of every VC awarded since its inception.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hancocks-london.com/ | title=Hancocks Jewellers |publisher=Hancocks of London| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

==Appearance==
[[Image:Victoria Cross Medal Ribbon & Bar.jpg|thumb|150px|Victoria Cross medal, ribbon, and bar.]]
The decoration is a [[cross pattée]], 41&nbsp;mm high, 36&nbsp;mm wide, bearing a crown surmounted by a lion, and the inscription <small>FOR VALOUR</small>.<ref>'''Original Warrant, Clause 1:''' ''{{lang|ang|Firstly. It is ordained that the distinction shall be styled and designated "The Victoria Cross", and shall consist of a Maltese cross of bronze, with our Royal crest in the centre, and underneath with an escroll bearing the inscription "For Valour".}}''</ref> This was originally to have been <small>FOR BRAVERY</small>, until it was changed on the recommendation of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the VC were brave in battle.<ref name=Navalmuseum>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/collections_special.htm |title=150 years of the Victoria Cross |publisher=[[Royal Naval Museum]] |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> The decoration, suspension bar and link weigh about 0.87 [[troy ounce]]s (27&nbsp;g).<ref>Ashcroft, Michael, p.16</ref>

The cross is suspended by a ring from a [[serif]]fed "V" to a bar ornamented with laurel leaves, through which the ribbon passes. The reverse of the suspension bar is engraved with the recipient's name, rank, number and unit.<ref name=vvaa/> On the reverse of the medal is a circular panel on which the date of the act for which it was awarded is engraved in the centre.<ref name=vvaa/>

The ribbon is crimson, 38&nbsp;mm (1.5 inches) wide. The original (1856) specification for the award stated that the ribbon should be red for army recipients and blue for naval ones.<ref>'''Original warrant, Clause Two:''' ''{{lang|ang|Secondly. It is ordained that the Cross shall be suspended from the left breast by a blue riband for the Navy, and by a red riband for the Army}}''</ref>  However the dark blue ribbon was abolished soon after the formation of the [[Royal Air Force]] on [[1 April]] [[1918]]. On [[22 May]] [[1920]] [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] signed a warrant that stated all recipients would now receive a red ribbon and the living recipients of the naval version were required to exchange their ribbons for the new colour.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.armymuseumwa.com.au/Refdocs/Foundation%20News%20Sept-Oct06.pdf | title=The Victoria Cross mentioned in newsletter | publisher=Army Museum of Western Australia| date=2006-09-01| accessdate=2007-06-21 }}</ref> Although the Army warrants state the colour as being red it is defined by most commentators as being crimson or "wine-red".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://collections.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.941 | title=The Victoria Cross | work=Imperial War Museum Exhibits and Firearms Collections | accessdate=2006-09-30 }}</ref>

==Awarding the medal==
The Victoria Cross is awarded for {{cquote|"... most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy."<ref name=modopshonours/>}}Awards of the Victoria Cross have always been announced in the pages of the ''[[London Gazette]]''. A recommendation for the VC is normally issued by an officer at [[Structure of the British Army|regimental level]] and has to be supported by three witnesses.<ref name=NAMUK/> In the case of a ''gallant and daring act'' being performed by a squadron, ship's company or a detached body of men (such as marines) in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross then a ballot is drawn. The officers select one officer, the NCOs select one individual and the private soldiers or seamen select two individuals.<ref>'''Original Warrant, Clause 13:''' ''{{lang|ang|Thirteenthly. It is ordained that in the event of a gallant and daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship's company, or detached body of seamen and marines not under fifty in number, or by a brigade, regiment, troop or company in which the admiral, general, or other officer commanding such forces may deem that all are equally brave and distinguished, and that no special selection can be made by them, then is such case the admiral, general, or other officer commanding, may direct that for any such body of seamen or marines, or for every troop or company of soldiers, one officer shall be selected by the officers engaged for the Decoration, and in like manner one petty officer or non-commissioned officer shall be selected by the petty officers and non-commissioned officers engaged, and two seamen or private soldiers or marines shall be selected by the seamen, or private soldiers, or marines engaged, respectively for the Decoration, and the names of those selected shall be transmitted by the senior officers in command of the Naval force, brigade, regiment, troop, or company, to the admiral or general officer commanding, who shall in due manner confer the Decoration as if the acts were done under his own eye.}}''</ref> For both individual and group awards the recommendation is then passed up the military [[Command hierarchy|hierarchy]] until it reaches the [[Secretary of State for War]],<ref name=NAMUK/> (now the [[Secretary of State for Defence]]) and then the monarch. Today, Royal assent is still required and the VCs are presented by the monarch.<ref name=NAMUK/>

Originally, the VC could not be awarded posthumously, and could not be awarded to Indian or African troops (although it could be awarded to their European officers).<ref name=vcfivetv>{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/victoriacross/ |title=Victoria Cross TV programme notes |publisher=fiveTV |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> Colonial troops were not eligible for the VC during the [[New Zealand Land Wars Victoria Cross recipients|New Zealand land wars]], so the [[New Zealand Cross (1869)]] was created.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/N/NewZealandCross/NewZealandCross/en |title=New Zealand Cross |publisher=New Zealand Encyclopedia |date=1966 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> One colonial soldier, Major [[Charles Heaphy]] was awarded the VC for his actions in 1864, as he was under British command.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/H/HeaphyCharles/HeaphyCharles/en |title=Charles heaphy biography |publisher=New Zealand Encyclopedia |date=1966 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> In 1905 it was made available to be awarded posthumously.<ref name=vcfivetv/> In the twentieth century it was made available to all troops in the service of the Crown (the first Indian soldier, [[Khudadad Khan]], received it in 1914).<ref name=vcfivetv/>

Between 1858 and 1881 the Victoria Cross could be awarded for actions taken "under circumstances of extreme danger" not in the face of the enemy.<ref>'''Warrant Amendment dated 1858-08-10''': ''{{lang|ang|subject to the rules and ordinances already made, on Officers and Men of Her Majesty's Naval and Military Services, who may perform acts of conspicuous courage and bravery under circumstances of extreme danger, such as the occurrence of a fire on board ship, or the foundering of a vessel at sea, or under any of the other circumstance in which, through the courage and devotion displayed, life or public property may be saved.}}''</ref> Six such awards were made during this period - five of them for a single incident (a shipwreck off the [[Andaman Islands]] in 1867).<ref name=Wargravescomm/> In 1881, the criteria were changed again and the VC was only awarded for acts of valour "in the face of the enemy".<ref name=Wargravescomm/> Due to this it has been suggested by many historians including Lord Ashcroft that the changing nature of warfare will result in fewer VCs being awarded.<ref name=vcfivetv/> The prevalence of more remote fighting techniques has meant that the opportunity to carry out acts of bravery are diminishing. The corresponding honour for acts of valour that do not qualify as "in the face of the enemy" is the [[George Cross]], which ranks alongside the VC.

===Separate Commonwealth awards===
{{seealso|Victoria Cross for Australia|Victoria Cross (Canada)|Victoria Cross for New Zealand}}
[[Image:VCstone.jpg|thumb|150px|Victoria Cross as it appears on [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] headstones.]]
In recent years, several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries have introduced their own honours systems, separate from the [[British Honours System]]. This began with the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, when the new countries of India and Pakistan introduced their own systems of awards. The VC was replaced by the MVC and Nishan-e-Haider respectivly, although the new countries continued to permit winners of British honors to wear their awards. Indeed, several Pakistani soldiers and officers were notable in being authorised to wear both the British medals and the ones earned in the later [[Indo-Pakistani wars]]. The "white" dominions  [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]]<ref name=nzgovdept>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/gallantry.html |title=New Zealand Honours |publisher=Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the [[Military Cross]] with their own. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour.<ref name=gazetteOofP/>

Australia was the first Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on [[15 January]] [[1991]]. Although it is a separate award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart.<ref name=ozvc>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/awards/medals/victoria_cross.cfm |title=The Victoria Cross for Australia |publisher=The Government of Australia |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>  Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from <small>FOR VALOUR</small> to the [[Latin]] <small>PRO VALORE</small> This was to accommodate both French and English, the two official languages of Canada.<ref name=CTVVChist>{{cite news| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070303/victoria_cross_070303/20070303?hub=TopStories |title=Top military honour now cast in Canada |last=CTV.ca |first News staff |publisher=CTV news |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

New Zealand was the third country to adapt the VC into its own honours system. While the New Zealand and Australian VCs are technically separate awards, the decoration is identical to the British design, including being cast from the same Crimean War gunmetal as the British VC.<ref name=nzgovdept/> As of July 2007, only one of the separate VCs has been awarded, to a New Zealand serviceman, [[Bill Apiata]], on [[2 July]] [[2007]], for his actions in conflict in [[Afghanistan]] in 2004.  

A Canadian version has been cast though that was originally to be awarded to the [[Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier]] at the rededication of the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial|Vimy Memorial]] on [[7 April]] [[2007]]. This date was chosen as it was the 90th anniversary of the [[battle of Vimy Ridge]] but pressure from Veterans organisations caused the plan to be dropped.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/article/189029 |last=Teotonio |first=Isabel |title= Vets irate at Victoria Cross proposal| publisher=Toronto Star| date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> 

While the New Zealand and Australian<ref name=ozvc/> awards are still made from the gunmetal captured during the Crimean War, the Canadian VC is not, and it is currently made of metal from an unspecified source.<ref name=CTVVChist/>

==Authority and privileges==
===Order of precedence===
As the highest award for valour of the United Kingdom, the Victoria Cross is always the first award to be presented at an investiture, even before [[knight]]hoods, as was shown at the investiture of [[Johnson Beharry]] who received his medal before General Sir [[Mike Jackson]].<ref name=beharry359>Beharry, Johnson p.359</ref> Due to its status the VC is always the first medal worn in a row of medals and it always appears first in [[post-nominal letters]] before any other awards or honours.<ref name=gazetteOofP>{{cite web| url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/download.asp?docid=559656 |title=Order of Precedence for Commonwealth Orders and Decorations |publisher=London Gazette |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> Similar acts of extreme valour that don't take place in the face of the enemy are honoured with the [[George Cross]] which has equal precedence but is awarded second due to fact that the GC is newer.<ref name=Modclub/>

===Salute===
There is a widespread erroneous myth that it is statutory for "all ranks to salute a bearer of the Victoria Cross." There is no official requirement that appears in the official Warrant of the VC, nor in [[Queen's Regulations and Orders]] but tradition dictates that this occurs and as such the Chiefs of Staff will salute a private soldier awarded a VC or GC.<ref name=Modclub>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/VictoriaAndGeorgeCrossHoldersTheWorldsMostExclusiveClub.htm |title=The world's most exclusive club |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

===Annuity===
The original warrant stated that NCOs and private soldiers or seamen on the Victoria Cross Register were entitled to a £10 per annum [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]].<ref>'''Original Warrant, Clause 14:''' ''{{lang|ang|It is ordained that every warrant officer, petty officer, seaman or marine, or non-commissioned officer, or soldier who shall have received the Cross, shall, from the date of the act by which the Decoration has been gained be entitled to a special pension of 10 pounds a year, and each additional bar conferred under Rule 4 on such warrant or petty officers, or non-commissioned officers or men, shall carry with it an additional pension of 5 pounds per annum.}}''</ref> In 1898, Queen Victoria raised the pension to £50 for those that could not earn a livelihood, be it from old age or infirmity.<ref>'''Warrant Amendment 1898-07-1898''' ''{{lang|ang|...authorize the increase of the Victoria Cross pension from 10 pounds to 50 pounds per annum, the condition to be satisfied in such cases being inability to earn a livelihood, in consequence of age or infirmity occasioned by causes beyond an Annuitant's control.}}''</ref> Today holders of the Victoria Cross or George Cross are entitled to an annuity, the amount of which is determined by the awarding government. Since 2002, the annuity paid by the British government is £1,495 per year.<ref>Glanfield, John, Chap1</ref> As of January 2005, under the ''Canadian Gallantry Awards Order'', members of the [[Canadian Forces]] or people who joined the British forces before [[31 March]] [[1949]] while domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland receive [[Canadian dollar|$]]3,000 per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canlii.org/ca/regu/si90-95/whole.html |title=Canadian Gallantry Awards Order |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> The Australian Government provides the two surviving Australian recipients a Victoria Cross Allowance under Subsection 103.4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/ |title=Veteran's Entitlement Act 1986 |publisher= Australasian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> In January 2006 the amount was [[Australian dollar|$A]]3,230 per year which is indexed annually in line with Australian Consumer Price Index increases.<ref> '''Australian Veteran's Entitlement Act 1986, Clause 103,''' ''Victoria Cross allowance granted to a veteran under this section is payable at the rate of [[Australian dollar|$A]]3,230 per year.

===Victoria Cross after World War II===
Since the end of the [[Second World War]] the original VC has been awarded 13 times: four in the [[Korean War]], one in the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] in 1965, four to Australians in the [[Vietnam War]], two during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, one in the [[Iraq War]] in 2004, and one in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] - in 2004.<ref name=vcregister/> The Victoria Cross for New Zealand has been awarded once, which was earned in 2004 but awarded in 2007.

In March 2002, it was widely reported in the media that the VC was to be awarded to an unnamed [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] in the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] for his involvement in fighting in the [[Tora Bora]] cave complex in November 2001.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1713764.stm | title=Net close in on Osama |publisher =[[BBC]] |date= 2001-12-16 | accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> There was some debate over whether he should be named but a compromise was reached that his name, and some specific details of the action, would be withheld from the official announcement in the ''London Gazette''.<ref name=Wargravescomm>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishwargraves.org.uk/newsite/medals/Victoria_Cross.htm |title=VC background |publisher=British War Graves Memorial |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> However, this did not happen; the VC award was never confirmed,<ref name=Wargravescomm/> and he and another member of the SAS, who had also been discussed as a possible VC recipient, were awarded [[Conspicuous Gallantry Cross]]es in October 2002 instead.<ref name=Wargravescomm/>

The two awards given in the 21st century to British personnel have been for actions in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan conflict]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]]. On [[18 March]] [[2005]], [[Private (rank)|Private]] [[Johnson Beharry]] of the 1st Battalion, [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]] became the first recipient of the VC since Sergeant [[Ian John McKay|Ian McKay]] in 1982.<ref name=beharry359/>The most recent award of the Victoria Cross to a British service person was the posthumous award on [[14 December]] [[2006]] to [[Corporal]] [[Bryan Budd]] of [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|3 Para]]. It was awarded for two separate acts of "inspirational leadership and the greatest valour" which led to his death, during actions against the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]] in July and August 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=250538&NewsAreaID=2 |title=Operational Honours: VC and GC for acts of exceptional valour |publisher=MOD press release |date=2006-12-24 |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

It was announced on [[2 July]] [[2007]] that Corporal [[Bill Apiata]] of the [[Special Air Service of New Zealand]] (NZ SAS) was awarded the [[Victoria Cross for New Zealand]] for carrying a severely wounded comrade 70 metres over rocky ground while under heavy machine-gun fire during the Afghanistan conflict in 2004.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0707/S00013.htm |title=Gallantry in Afghanistan |publisher=NZ Government through news agency |accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/0707/VCmediakit2jul07.pdf |title=Press kit related to july 2007 gallantry awards (NZ) |publisher=NZ Government through news agency |accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref>

=== Forfeited VCs ===
:''See also [[Victoria Cross forfeitures]]

The original Royal Warrant involved an expulsion clause that allowed for a recipient's name to be erased from the official register in certain wholly discreditable circumstances, and his pension cancelled.<ref>'''Original Warrant Clause 15:''' ''{{lang|ang|Fifteenthly. In order to make such additional provision as shall effectually preserve pure this most honourable distinction, it is ordained that, if any person be convicted of treason, cowardice, felony, or of any infamous crime, or if he be accused of any such offence, and doth not after a reasonable time surrender himself to be tried for the same, his name shall forthwith be erased from the registry of individuals upon whom the said Decoration shall have been conferred, and by an especial Warrant under Our Royal Sign Manual, and the pension conferred under Rule 14 shall cease and determine from the date of such Warrant. It is hereby further declared, that We, Our Heirs and Given Successors, shall be the all judges of the circumstances requiring such expulsion; moreover, We shall at all times have power to restore such persons as may at any time have been expelled, both to the enjoyment of the Decoration and Pension.}}''</ref> [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] though felt very strongly that the decoration should never be forfeited and in a letter to his Private Secretary, [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]], on [[26 July]] [[1920]], his views are forcibly expressed: {{cquote|The King feels so strongly that, no matter the crime committed by anyone on whom the VC has been conferred, the decoration should not be forfeited. Even were a VC to be sentenced to be hanged for murder, he should be allowed to wear his VC on the gallows.<ref name=NAMUK>{{cite web |url=http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/vc/page3.shtml| title=Posthumous VCs |publisher=National Army Museum |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>}}

After his intervention the rules pertaining to forfeitures were changed in 1931<ref name=NAMUK/> and the eight men who had lost their VCs were restored to official lists.<ref name=MilhistSteve>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/vc_awards.htm |title=British Military & Criminal History in the period 1900 to 1999 | publisher=Stephen Stratford |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

==Value of the VC==
{{wikinews|Victoria Cross fetches record price at auction}}
===Sales of the VC===
Some recipients have felt the need to sell their medals, often to avoid rows between their children:<ref name=Modclub/>{{cquote|"''By selling the medal they're taking the problem away. Now that they sell for such a huge sum, it is very difficult for someone to leave their medal to a regiment. The most important thing is that it is on display somewhere to serve as a future inspiration.''" '''Didy Grahame, Secretary to the VC and GC Association'''<ref name=Modclub/>}}

The inherent value of the VC can be seen by the increasing sums that the medals reach at auction. In 1955 the medal awarded to [[Edmund Barron Hartley]] was bought at [[Sotheby's]] for the then record price of £300. In October 1966 the [[Middlesex Regiment]] paid a new record figure of £900 for a medal awarded after the [[Battle of the Somme]]. In January 1969 the record reached £1700 for the medal of [[William Rennie]]<ref>''£1700 World Record...'';[[The Times]]; 22 January 1969; pg 12 col F </ref> In April 2004 the VC awarded in 1944 to [[Sergeant]] [[Norman Cyril Jackson|Norman Jackson]], [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], was sold at auction for £235,250.<ref name=AGErecord/> 

On [[24 July]] [[2006]], an auction at [[Bonhams]] in [[Sydney]] of the VC awarded to [[Alfred John Shout|Captain Alfred Shout]] fetched a world record hammer price of [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1 million. Captain Alfred Shout was awarded the VC posthumously in 1915 for hand-to-hand combat at the Lone Pine trenches in [[Gallipoli]] [[Turkey]]. The buyer ([[Kerry Stokes]]) has indicated that it will be displayed at the Australian War Memorial with the eight other VCs awarded to Australians at Gallipoli.<ref name=AGErecord>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Gallipoli-VC-medal-sets-auction-record/2006/07/24/1153593264537.html |title=Gallipoli VC medal sets auction record |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> 

=== Thefts of the VC ===
Given the rarity of the Victoria Cross and the fact they are rarely sold, these decorations are highly prized on the [[black market]].<ref name=VCstolen/> Several VCs have been stolen and being valuable have been placed on the [[Interpol]] watch-list for stolen items.<ref name=VCstolen>{{cite web| url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/aastolen.htm | title=List of stolen VCs | publisher=Iain Stewart, Victoria Cross.org| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

The VC awarded to [[Milton Fowler Gregg|Milton Gregg]], which was donated to the [[Royal Canadian Regiment Museum]] in [[London, Ontario]] [[Canada]] in 1979, was stolen on [[Canada Day]], ([[1 July]] [[1980]]), when the museum was overcrowded<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/history/victoria_cross.htm | title="Victoria Cross: Theft of the VC | publisher=solarnavigator.net| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> and has been missing since. A VC awarded in 1917 to Canadian soldier Corporal [[Filip Konowal]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoukes.com/history/konowal/ |title=Information on Konowal |publisher= Lubomyr Y. Luciuk and Ron Sorobey| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> was stolen from the same museum in 1973 and was not recovered until 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2004/08/23/victoria040823.html |title=Stolen VC back on display |publisher=CBC Canada |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

On [[December 2]], [[2007]], 9 Victoria Crosses were among 100 medals stolen from locked, reinforced glass cabinets at the [[QEII Army Memorial Museum]] in [[Waiouru]], New Zealand. [[Charles Upham]]'s VC and bar was among these.<ref name=NZHerald>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10479634|title=Army medal theft 'insult' to our nation's heritage|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref>

===In the UK===
In 2004 a national Victoria Cross and George Cross memorial was installed in [[Westminster Abbey]] close to the tomb of [[The Unknown Warrior]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=134063 |title= News of Memorial |publisher=MoD |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> Westminster Abbey is a living monument to British history in that it contains monuments and memorials to central figures in British History including [[Charles Darwin]] and [[James I of England|James VI & I]]. As such it was a significant honour for the VC to be commemorated in Westminster Abbey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/london-westminster-abbey.htm |title=Westminster Abbey, a history |publisher=Sacred Destinations guide |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

===Private collections===
====Lord Ashcroft====
British businessman and politician [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]] has amassed a private collection of over 140 VCs. Lord Ashcroft purchased his first medal in 1986 and the collection now contains over a tenth of the medals ever awarded, the largest private collection of such medals ever accumulated. The medals are now looked after by ''The Ashcroft Collection'' and a book detailing the collection was published in November 2006.<ref name=Ashcroftweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.victoriacrossheroes.com/collection.html|title=Ashcroft Collection website |publisher=Lord Ashcroft |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

====Canon William Lummis====
:''See also [[Canon William Lummis]]

'''Canon William Murrell Lummis''', [[Military Cross|MC]], was a military historian who built up an archive on the service records and final resting places of Victoria Cross holders.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mdani.demon.co.uk/esjd/page4.htm | title=Lummis cited as 'leading VC researcher'| publisher=Michael Daniels pHd|date=2007-06-15 | accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> This was then summarised into a pamphlet which was taken to be an authoritative source on these matters. However, Lummis was aware of short-comings in his work and encouraged [[David Charles Harvey|David Harvey]] to continue it. The result was Harvey's seminal book ''[[Monuments to Courage]].'' In 2007 the [[Royal Mail]] used material from Lummis' archives to produce a collection of stamps commemorating Victoria Cross winners.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/shop?catId=9300091&pageType=Others&pageId=shp_prddetails&product=prod40680016 | title=The Post Office issues VC stamps in 2007 illustrated with artifacts from the collection of Canon Lummis in the National Army Museum | publisher=Royal Mail |date=2007-06-15 | accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>
