'''''Casino Royale''''' ([[2006 in film|2006]]) is the twenty-first film in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]] and the first to star [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. Based on the [[1953 in literature|1953]] [[Casino Royale (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]], it was adapted by screenwriters [[Neal Purvis]], [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]], and [[Paul Haggis]] and directed by [[Martin Campbell]]. 

It is the third screen adaptation of the ''Casino Royale'' novel, which was previously produced as a [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|1954 television episode]] and a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 satirical film]]. However, the 2006 film is the only [[EON Productions]] adaptation of Fleming's novel. It is a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the Bond franchise, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede any previous film.<ref>{{cite web|title=IGN: Interview: Campbell on Casino Royale|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/659/659741p1.html|work=IGN.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc|date=[[2005-10-19]]|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> This not only frees the Bond franchise from more than forty years of continuity, but allows the film to show a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/entertainment/061116_bond_review.html|title=New James Bond Proves Worthy of Double-0 Status|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=SPACE.com|date=[[2006-10-21]]}}</ref> The film is set at the beginning of James Bond's career as Agent 007, having earned his [[Licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]. After preventing a terrorist attack at Miami Airport, Bond falls for [[Vesper Lynd]], the treasury agent assigned to provide the money he needs to foil a high-stakes poker tournament organized by [[Le Chiffre]]. The 22nd James Bond film, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', will be a direct sequel to ''Casino Royale'' and will continue some aspects of the story such as Le Chiffre's associate, Mr. White, and Lynd's Algerian boyfriend.

The casting for the movie involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy over Daniel Craig when he was eventually selected. Some [[Pierce Brosnan]] fans threatened to boycott the film in protest.<ref name="Location2">{{cite web|title=Blond, James Blond|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/08/commentary/mediabiz/index.htm|work=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=[[2006-11-06]]|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> Despite this, the film, and Daniel Craig's performance in particular, earned critical acclaim. ''Casino Royale'' was produced by EON Productions for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], marking the first official Bond film to be co-produced by the latter studio, which had produced and originally distributed the 1967 [[Canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] film version.

==Plot==
In [[Prague]], James Bond corners and kills corrupt [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] section chief Dryden and his underworld contact, earning his double-0 status. Meanwhile in Uganda, a Mr. White arranges a meeting between a banker, Le Chiffre, and the leader of a guerrilla group seeking a safe haven for his funds. Le Chiffre assures the leader that there is "no risk in the portfolio", but his investments actually involve considerable risk: he [[short (finance)|short sells]] successful companies and then engineers terrorist attacks to sink their stock values.

In his first mission as Agent 007, Bond goes to Madagascar in pursuit of an international bomb-maker named Mollaka. After a [[free running]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theurbanheroes.com/client.php?client=1 |title=Curtis - Sébastien's stunt double |date=2006-11-29 |publisher=www.theurbanheroes.com |accessdate=2007-05-14|quote=Curtis was hired to be a stunt double in the recent James Bond film ''Casino Royale''. He was on location in the Bahamas for 13 weeks working closely with Gary Powell, the stunt coordinator, to help plan and execute the opening chase scene.}}</ref> chase across the city to the [[List of fictional countries|Nambutu]] embassy, Bond kills his target and blows up a part of the embassy to enable his escape. He obtains Mollaka's mobile phone and discovers that it has received an SMS from Alex Dimitrios, an associate of Le Chiffre in the Bahamas. Bond travels there, wins his [[Aston Martin DB5]], and seduces Dimitrios' wife, Solange, who reveals that her husband is flying to Miami on business. Bond follows him to Miami, where he kills Dimitrios before noticing Le Chiffre's henchman, Carlos, leaving for the Miami Airport. There, Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype [[List of James Bond vehicles#Aircraft|''Skyfleet'' airliner]], leaving the banker with a major financial loss, since he had shorted and bought [[put options]] on Skyfleet stock which expired worthless.

Now under pressure to recoup his clients' money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]. Hoping that a defeat would force Le Chiffre to aid the British government in exchange for protection from his creditors, MI6 enters Bond into the tournament. He meets up with Mathis, his ally in Montenegro, and Vesper Lynd, a treasury agent, who is assigned to look after his handling of the government's $10 million [[buy-in]]. As the tournament progresses, Bond loses his initial stake and becomes enraged when Vesper refuses to authorize him to buy back in because she considers his play reckless.

[[Image:CasinoRoyalePhoto.jpg|thumb|left|Bond (right) and Le Chiffre (left) play poker at the Casino Royale.]]

Distraught over his failure, Bond prepares to assassinate Le Chiffre when he is intercepted by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Felix Leiter, also playing in the tournament. Leiter offers to supply Bond with the funds to re-enter the tournament in exchange for allowing the CIA custody of Le Chiffre. Back in the game, Bond rapidly recoups his losses when Le Chiffre and his associates attempt to poison him, an attempt Bond narrowly survives before winning the tournament. Following her celebratory dinner with Bond, Vesper is abducted by Le Chiffre, who uses her to lure Bond into a near-fatal car chase and ultimate capture. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for the access code to the game's winnings and when it becomes clear that Bond will not yield, Le Chiffre prepares to castrate him. Mr. White enters and kills Le Chiffre and his associates for their failure. Bond and Vesper are left alive.

Bond awakens in a hospital on Lake Como and orders Mathis, whom Le Chiffre identified as a [[double agent]] working for him, arrested. Bond admits his love for Vesper and vows to quit the service before it strips him of his humanity. Accordingly, he posts his resignation to M and goes on a romantic holiday in Venice with Vesper. However, Bond soon learns that his poker winnings were never deposited into the Treasury's account. Realizing that Vesper has stolen them, he pursues her and members of the organization she is working for into a building under renovation. After killing the henchmen in the building, Bond finds Vesper imprisoned in an elevator. Apologizing to him tearfully, she locks herself inside and the elevator plunges underwater. Bond dives in and attempts to rescue her, but she resists him and drowns. Mr. White, watching from a balcony, walks away with the money.

Bond, feeling betrayed, learns that Vesper had a French-Algerian boyfriend who was kidnapped and held for ransom by the organization behind Le Chiffre and Mr. White. Bond learns that she agreed to deliver the [[ransom]] money (his winnings) only if they would consent to leave Bond alive as well as her boyfriend. He discovers White's name and number in Vesper's mobile phone. White, arriving at a palatial estate near Lake Como, receives a phone call and is shot in the leg. Bond appears, gun in hand, and says, "The name's Bond, James Bond."

Two major exclusions from the film are the characters of [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Their exclusion makes ''Casino Royale'' the second film in the series without Q (''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' being the first), and the first without Moneypenny. In October 2005, producer Michael G. Wilson stated that the characters were not in the movie because they were not in the book, though Moneypenny was mentioned by Bond in the novel. The decision to leave Moneypenny's character out from the film coincided with the announcement by actress [[Samantha Bond]], who had portrayed the character in the previous four films, that she would not be reprising the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hastings|first=Chris|coauthors=Nina Goswami and David Fickling|title=Ah, Miss Moneypenny.

==Production==
[[EON Productions]] gained the rights for ''Casino Royale'' in 1999 after [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] exchanged them for [[MGM]]'s rights to ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sony Pictures, in an accord with MGM, drops its plan to produce new James Bond movies.|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1999-03-30]]|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30814FC35540C738FDDAA0894D1494D81&n=Top%2fNews%2fBusiness%2fSmall%20Business%2fMarketing%20and%20Advertising|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> In March 2004, [[Neal Purvis]] and [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]] began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back an Ian Fleming flavour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Purvis & Wade Talk Bond & Jinx|publisher=MI6.co.uk|date=[[2004-03-09]]|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/event_purvis_wade_talk.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> [[Paul Haggis]]' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book. And there was a confession. So in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. And then she sent Bond to chase after the villains. And Bond chased the villains into the house. And I don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her."<ref>{{cite news | author = Mark Lawson | title = Paul Haggis | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = [[2007-12-04]] | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2223284,00.html | accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] expressed interest in directing an adaptation of the ''Casino Royale'' novel,<ref>{{cite news|title=Kill Bill director aims for Bond|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2004-05-16]]|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3718975.stm|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> though this was only a personal interest, and he did not follow this up with EON. In the June 2007 issue of ''[[GQ]]'' (UK) Tarantino confirmed his desire to make ''Casino Royale'' after ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. Tarantino claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believes that this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with ''Casino Royale''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Heath|title=Quentin Tarantino Interview|work=GQ|publisher=|date=[[June 2007]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director.<ref>{{cite web|author=EON Productions|title=James Bond 21 Is Casino Royale|publisher=MI6.co.uk|date=[[2005-02-03]]|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_announced.php3|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with this film.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Consortium Led by Sony Corporation of America, Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Comcast Corporation and DLJ Merchant Banking Partners Enters into Definitive Agreement to Acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|publisher=Sony Corporation|date=2004-09-23|url=http://www.sony.com/SCA/press/040924.shtml|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

EON admitted that they had relied too heavily on [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects in the more recent films, particularly ''Die Another Day'', and were keen to accomplish the stunts in ''Casino Royale'' "the old fashioned way."<ref>{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dayla|title=Fake stunts banished as new Bond keeps it real|publisher=[[The Times Online]]|date=[[2006-03-14]]|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2084375,00.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade, and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible to the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming's darker storyline and characterization of Bond.<ref name="cinematographer">{{cite news|author=Jon Silberg|title=High Stakes for 007|publisher=[[American Cinematographer]]|date=[[December 2006]]|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/December2006/CasinoRoyale/page1.php|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

''Casino Royale'' became the first Bond film to take its title from a Fleming novel or short story since 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. It is also the first Bond film since then not to be adapted as a [[novelization]]. Instead, a film [[tie-in]] edition of Fleming's original novel was published.<ref>{{cite web|title=Casino Royale (movie tie-in) (James Bond 007) (Paperback)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|date=[[2006-10-31]]|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037668|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

===Casting===
Throughout 2004 and 2005, a whole legion of potential new actors to portray James Bond were speculated on by the media, ranging from established Hollywood actors, such as [[Eric Bana]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Goran Višnjić]] and [[Clive Owen]], to many unknown actors from a number of different countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dallas & Casino Royale Casting Rumors|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/95/9395.php|work=Variety|publisher=MovieWeb, Inc|date=[[2005-09-28]]| accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> At one point producer [[Michael G.

But being only 22 years old at the time, he was considered too young.<ref name="cast2">{{cite web|author=Chavez, Kellvin|url=http://www.latinoreview.com/films_2005/sonypictures/zorro2/mc-interview.html|publisher=Latino Review|title=Exclusive interview with Martin Campbell on Zorro and Bond|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

In May 2005, Daniel Craig announced that MGM and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him that he would get the role of Bond, and [[Matthew Vaughn]] told reporters that MGM offered him the opportunity to direct, but EON Productions at that point had not approached either of them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Craig, Vaughn on Bond|url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/609/609721p1.html|date=[[2005-05-03]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|date=[[2005-05-03]]|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> Later, Craig stated that the producers had indeed offered him the role, but he had declined until a script was available for him to read.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seven's Deadly Sins|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1949392,00.html|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=[[2006-11-17]]|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

By August 2005, speculation was high that the 37-year-old Daniel Craig was being seriously considered, although full casting for the role was not actually done until September. Then, on [[October 14]], [[2005]], EON Productions and Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed to the public at a press conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1592512,00.html|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|title=Daniel Craig confirmed as 006th screen Bond|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> Significant controversy followed the decision, as it was doubted if the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period Internet campaigns such as "danielcraigisnotbond.com" expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.moono.com/news/news01533.html|title=Anti-Bond protests|publisher=Moono|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed.<ref name="Location2"/>

The next important casting was that of the lead [[Bond girl]], Vesper Lynd. Casting director Debbie McWilliams acknowledged that Hollywood actresses [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Charlize Theron]] were strongly considered for the role and that [[Belgium|Belgian]] actress [[Cécile de France]] had also auditioned, but her [[English English|English accent]] "wasn't up to scratch."<ref>{{cite web|title=Casino Royale Bond girl candidates|publisher=[[MI6.co.uk]]|date=[[2006-07-07]]|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_girl_casting_rumours.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Audrey Tautou]] was also considered, but not chosen because of her role in ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' that was released in May 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4470|title=The New Bond Girls!|publisher=superherohype.com|date=[[2006-07-07]]|accessdate=2006-03-04}}</ref> It was announced on February 16, 2006 that French actress [[Eva Green]] would play the role of Vesper Lynd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/news/sb/2006-02-17#film5|publisher=StudioBriefing|title=New Bond Girl Will Be "Very Much an Equal to Bond"|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[Image:Daniel Craig on Venice yacht crop w Wilson.jpg|thumb|left|Producer Michael G. Wilson and Craig in Venice during filming]]
Principal photography for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on [[January 30]], [[2006]] and concluded on [[July 21]], [[2006]]. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague, with additional location shooting in the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The shooting schedule concluded at [[Pinewood Studios]].<ref name="Real">{{cite video|title=James Bond: For Real|medium=DVD|publisher=Special Treats Productions|year=2006}}</ref>

Initially, Michael G. Wilson confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would either be filmed or take place in Prague and [[South Africa]]. However, EON Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cox|first=John|title=Eon facing South African detour|publisher=CommanderBond.net|date=[[2005-08-08]]|url=http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2877|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and [[cinematographer|director of photography]] [[Phil Meheux]] were scouting [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film.<ref> {{cite news|last=Cox|first=John|title=Bond bound for Bahamas|date=[[2005-09-13]]|publisher=CommanderBond.net|url=http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2922|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> On [[October 6]] [[2005]], Martin Campbell confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would film in the Bahamas and "maybe Italy." In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt coordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague and at Pinewood Studios where the film used several stages as well as the paddock tank and the historic "[[007 Stage|Albert R. Broccoli 007 Stage]]". Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for [[Dunsfold]] Aerodrome in [[Surrey]], the cricket pavilion at [[Eton College]] (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].<ref name="Location2">{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Veronica|title=On the trail of James Bond|publisher=News.com.au|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,23483,20707920-27978,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

After Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around [[New Providence]] were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in [[Mbale]], Uganda was filmed at Black Park, Country Park in Buckinghamshire concluding on [[July 4]] [[2006]].

===Effects===
[[Image:GunBarrelPhoto.jpg|thumb|The [[James Bond gun barrel sequence|gunbarrel sequence]] modified as part of the opening sequence]]
In designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer [[Daniel Kleinman]] was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of ''Casino Royale'', which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood.<ref name=book>Fleming, Ian. ''Casino Royale''. London: Jonathan Cape (1953).</ref> Kleinman said, "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.<ref>{{cite web | title=Credits design | url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=4511| work=Daniel Kleinman | publisher=MI6.com | date=[[2006-12-06]] | accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitized the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at the Framestore CFC in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns.<ref name=cfc>{{cite web|title=Commercials at Framestore CFC|url=http://www.framestore-cfc.com/commercials/index.html|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

For the rest of the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor [[Chris Corbould]], as with the producers, wanted to return to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduce digital effects. According to Corbould, “CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It’s the best way to go”.<ref name="Real"/> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name="Real"/>

First on the schedule were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref name="Real"/> In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger, and reinforced with steel.<ref name="Real"/>

The sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name="Real"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name="Real"/>

The sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film.<ref name="Real"/> For the scene involving Bond following Vesper into the house undergoing renovation supported by inflatable balloons, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves which were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in {{convert|19|ft|m}} of water, and utilized banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.<ref name="Real"/>

The scene involving the car crash was devised using an [[Aston Martin DB9]] - modified to look like Bond's [[Aston Martin DBS V12]] - specially modified and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450 mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at [[General Motors Proving Grounds#Millbrook Proving Grounds|Millbrook Proving Grounds]] and stunt driver Adam Kirley had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding <span style="white-space:nowrap">70&nbsp;mph&nbsp;(113&nbsp;km/h)</span>, the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] on [[November 5]], [[2006]] as a new [[world record]].<ref name="Real"/>

===Music===
{{Main|Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)}}

The soundtrack of ''Casino Royale'', released by [[Sony Classical]] on [[November 14]] [[2006]] featured music composed by veteran composer [[David Arnold]], his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series, while Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the [[Film score|score]]. Producers Michael G.

Cornell was first reported to be writing and performing the song in collaboration with David Arnold on [[July 20]], [[2006]] by the Finnish newspaper ''Ilta-Sanomat'' and the complete score was completed early on the morning of [[October 11]] [[2006]].<ref name="arnold">{{cite web|title=David Arnold|url=http://www.davidarnold.com|publisher=David Arnold|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> "You Know My Name" is the first theme song since 1983's ''[[Octopussy]]'' to use a different title than the film, and Cornell is the first male performer since [[a-ha]] in 1987's ''The Living Daylights''. It is the fourth title theme after ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' and ''Octopussy'', that does not make any reference to the title of the film.<ref name="arnold"/> It is the first title song to be repeated in the end credits since "A View to a Kill". The end titles begin with the James Bond theme, but halfway through, an abbreviated version of Cornell's song is played.

==Release==
''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]], the [[Odeon West End]] and the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]] simultaneously in London on [[November 14]] [[2006]]. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], was in attendance with the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]. It was the third James Bond premiere that the Queen had attended following ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967) and ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002).<ref> {{cite web|title=Daniel Craig makes his 007 debut at premiere of Casino Royale|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=416461&in_page_id=1773&ico=Homepage&icl=TabModule&icc=picbox&ct=5|date=[[2006-11-18]]|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stars out for Bond royal premiere|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6146090.stm|date=[[2006-11-14]]|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

Only two days following the premiere, pirated copies appeared for sale in London. “The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK,” said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6157066.stm

The film achieved [[Pound sterling|GB£]]1.7 million of ticket sales in the UK on its first day of release, grossing more than twice as much as the former record-holder ''Die Another Day'', and becoming the highest UK take for any Bond film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/latest-tracking-bond-vs-birds-a-nailbiter/|title=Casino Royale UK Biggest 007 Opening|publisher=Deadline hollywood daily|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> Weekend opening total in the UK was GB£13,400,000, surpassing the previous record of GB£9,100,000 held by ''Die Another Day''. It claimed the third biggest opening weekend and became the sixth highest grossing film of all time in the UK with a box office total of approximately $108-$109 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commanderbond.net/article/3904|title=Casino Royale - Box Office Details|date=[[2007-02-23]]|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> (the total USA box office was approximately US$170 million).The film also had the biggest Bond opening in the [[Republic of Ireland]] with over [[euro|€]]1,100,000 in the first 2 weeks. Altogether the film took about €4,200,000 in Ireland. From [[November 16]] to [[November 19]] [[2006]], the film took in over $40,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Casino Royale - Box Office Data, Movie News, Cast Information|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/JB21.php|work=The Numbers|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

Opening day estimates in the United States and Canada showed ''Casino Royale'' on top with $14,750,000, while opening weekend estimates showed it in the second place with $40,600,000,<ref>{{cite news|title=Casino Royale grosses $40.6 million|publisher=SuperHeroHype!|date=[[2006-11-19]]|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4922|accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref> as well as earning another $42,000,000 internationally. Although ''[[Happy Feet]]'' won the overall weekend box office contest, such a comparison in earnings is problematic, as ''Happy Feet'' has little more than half the running time of ''Casino Royale'', and therefore had significantly more screenings per day, which translates into more potential gross. A better indication of the film's relative performances is that ''Casino Royale'', per theatre, outperformed ''Happy Feet'', which was released in 370 more theatres. According to [[Box Office Mojo]], ''Casino Royale'' took in, on average, $11,890 per theatre, while ''Happy Feet'' grossed $10,918 per theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=happyfeet.htm|title=Happy Feet (2006) box office|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref><ref name="BOM-CR"/>

==Reception==
Critics gave the film a positive response, in particular Craig's performance and credibility. During production this had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as Craig did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark, and suave. ''The Daily Mirror'', which had once run a front page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, ''The Name's Bland &mdash; James Bland'',<ref>{{cite news|title=The Name's Bland..

''[[The Times]]'' compared the more assertive portrayal by Craig to [[Timothy Dalton]], and praised the action as edgy,<ref>{{cite news|title="Brilliant" Bond seduces critics|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2006-11-04]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6116286.stm?ls|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wavell|first=Stuart|title=Potato Head shoots way to 007 triumph|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=[[2006-11-05]]|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2437998,00.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Critic Paul Arendt of BBC Films,<ref>{{cite web|last=Arendt|first=Paul|title=Casino Royale (2006)|publisher=BBC Films|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/11/06/casino_royale_2006_review.shtml|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Kim Newman]] of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Newman|title=Casino Royale|publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10199|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> and Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Casino Royale|publisher=Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/VE1117932077.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal, and cold.

Though American radio personality [[Michael Medved]] gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as "intriguing, audacious and very original... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas", he commented that the "sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Michael Medved]]|title=Casino Royale|publisher=Eye On Entertainment|url=http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/casinoroyale.doc|accessdate=2006-11-30}}</ref> Similarly, a reviewer for ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' praised the film for its darkness and Craig's performance, but felt that "like the novel, it suffers from a lack of sharpness in the plot" and believed that it required additional editing, particularly the finale.<ref>{{cite web|title=The best Bond since Connery|publisher=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|date=[[2006-10-20]]|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006480716,00.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Commentators such as Emanuell Levy concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Emanuell|title=Casino Royale B+|publisher=Emanuell Levy|url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=3668|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> In addition, Vesper Lynd (as portrayed by Eva Green) was chosen by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' as the fourth greatest Bond girl in the entire film series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joshua Rich|title=The 10 Best Bond Girls|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=[[2007-03-30]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1557446_8,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of ''[[The Observer]]'' who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier, and criticized Craig's performance with the review title "You might be shaken, but this Bond won't leave you stirred".<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Tim|title=You might be shaken, but this Bond won't leave you stirred|publisher=[[The Observer]]|date=[[2006-11-05]]|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1939830,00.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Steve Sailer]] of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' also criticized the film, saying it was "mediocre in execution and bloated in conception, wrapping the usual elephantine Bond movie mechanics around Fleming's minimal plot."<ref>{{cite news|last=Sailer|first=Steve|title=Unshaken, unstirred|publisher=The American Conservative|url=http://www.isteve.com/Film_Casino_Royale.htm|date=[[2006-12-18]]|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>
