== Trivia ==
*Mainly due to the similarities in vocal style, the group is often mistaken for [[Metallica]]. The song ''Hunger'' from the self titled debut received many downloads on [[Napster]] due to the fact that many people falsely believed it to be a new unreleased Metallica song or a collaboration between [[Megadeth]] and [[Metallica]].<ref>
