''Pirie'' was laid down at the [[Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd|Broken Hill Propriety]] Shipyard at [[Whyalla, South Australia]] on 19 May 1941, launched on 3 December 1941 by Mrs. H. T.

==Operational history==
On 11 April 1943, while escorting a British supply ship to [[Oro Bay]], ''Pirie'' was attacked by a large number of Japanese dive bombers.<ref name=spc/> At least seven bombs were dropped; the first six were near-misses, but the seventh penetrated the armoured bridge canopy, deflected off the hemsman's station, struck and killed the Gunnery Officer, then detonated on the upper deck.<ref name=spc/> Six other sailors were killed and four more wounded.<ref name=spc/> Anti-aircraft fire drove off the fighters before they could attack again, and downed several planes.<ref name=spc/> Repairs were completed in May 1943.<ref name=spc/>

''Pirie'' was the third Australian warship to enter Japanese territorial waters during the war, entering [[Tokyo Bay]] on 31 August 1945.<ref name=spc/> She remained in Tokyo Bay until mid-September and was present on [[Victory over Japan Day]] (2 September 1945), when the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] was signed.<ref name=spc/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq69-2.htm |title=Allied Ships Present in Tokyo Bay During the Surrender Ceremony, 2 September 1945 |accessdate=13 January 2007 |date=27 May 2005 |publisher=Naval Historical Center - U.S. Navy |quote=Taken from ''Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPAC/CINCPOA) A16-3/FF12 Serial 0395, 11 February 1946: Report of Surrender and Occupation of Japan''}}</ref>
