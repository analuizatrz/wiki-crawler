== Creation and conception ==

== History ==
[[Image:Azula Hates Barbie2.png|thumb|right|250px|Azula's cruelty was evident even as a child.]]
Azula was born to Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa around two years after her brother, [[Zuko]]. As such, she is the descendant of both Fire Lord Sozin (from Ozai) and Avatar Roku (from Princess Ursa).<ref name="The Avatar And The Firelord">{{cite episode|title=The Avatar and the Firelord|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=306|airdate=2007-10-24|season=3|number=6|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=306|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
She is named for her grandfather, Ozai's father, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender minor book 2 characters#Fire Lord Azulon|Fire Lord Azulon]]. Azula grew up in the riches, splendor, and privileges of being royalty in the Fire Nation. Even when she was only [[Zuko Alone|ten years old]], Azula expressed her natural talents, along with her tendency for malice and perfectionism. Her sharp wits and the prodigy she displayed towards [[Firebending]] gained her much attention and acclaim and made her Ozai's favorite child. Her father began raising her as his true heir early on, taking her into his confidence and grooming her in politics while ignoring Zuko. From the quality of her [[Fire Nation#Azula’s Ship|ship]] and soldiers, her favored status was readily apparent.

She had no desire to waste time playing around like a regular girl. She was much more interested in power, suggesting that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the [[heir apparent]], her [[Uncle Iroh]], whom she also dubbed "a quitter and a loser" for abandoning his siege at Ba Sing Se.<ref name="Zuko Alone">{{cite episode|title=Zuko Alone|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=207|airdate=2006-05-12|season=2|number=7|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=207|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
No love developed between her and Zuko throughout the next few years—when he was burned by their father in an Agni Kai, she watched with a [[Schadenfreude|savage triumph]].<ref name="The Storm">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=112|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=112|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

== Plot overview ==
=== Book 1: Water ===
During one of Iroh's flashbacks in "[[The Storm (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|The Storm]]," Azula can briefly be seen within the audience observing the [[Fire Nation#Agni Kai|Agni Kai]] in which Prince Zuko receives his facial scar from his father.<ref name="The Storm">{{cite episode | title = The Storm | episodelink = The Storm (Avatar: The Last Airbender) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-06-03 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 12}}</ref> 
Her identity was revealed a month later at the 2005 San Diego Comic Con. The character was revealed to be Prince Zuko's younger sister.<ref>[http://www.asmzine.com/features/conventions/sdcc05/ ASM: San Diego Comic-Con 2005 Coverage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Azula makes a full, albeit [[cameo appearance|cameo]], appearance at the end of the season one finale, The Siege of the North.<ref name="The Siege of the North Part 2">{{cite episode|title=The Siege of the North, Part II|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=120|airdate=2005-12-02|season=1|number=20|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=120|credits=Director: Dave Filoni; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

=== Book 2: Earth ===
When Fire Lord Ozai branded Iroh a traitor and her brother Zuko a failure, she obeyed her father's command for her to go and capture them.<ref name="The Siege of the North Part 2">{{cite episode | title = The Siege of the North | episodelink = The Siege of the North | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-12-02 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 19}}</ref>
While in Omashu, Azula first encountered [[Aang|the Avatar]]. Soon after the battle, she named the Avatar as a personal target in addition to her brother and elisted her friends [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Ty Lee|Ty Lee]] and [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Mai|Mai]]. <ref name="Return To Omashu">{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=203|airdate=2006-04-07|season=2|number=3|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=203|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Though both are her friends, Azula had to use some malicious persuasion to get Ty Lee to join; in "Return to Omashu", Azula responded to Ty Lee's rejection of her proposal by ordering the insertion wild animals and other dangers during Ty Lee's circus act.<ref name="Return To Omashu" /> Azula continues to pursue the Avatar for most of the season. While in Ba Sing Se, however, Azula's chase ceases until her later attempt to take over Ba Sing Se, which she acieves in one of the last episodes in the season by disguising her group as the Kyoshi warriors so the Earth King would let them in.<ref name="The Earth King">{{cite episode|title=The Earth King|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=218|airdate=2006-11-16|season=2|number=18|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=218|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: John O'Bryan|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

=== Book 3: Fire ===
==== Returning Home ====
Upon returning home, Azula and Zuko are welcomed with open arms by the people with a rally held in their honor to praise their successful efforts at the Earth Kingdom capital. Later Azula and Zuko converse about Zuko's long-awaited meeting with their father. When Zuko meets his father, it is revealed that Azula misinformed Ozai that he was the one who killed the Avatar. When confronted, Azula claims that she saw how worried Zuko was about not having the Avatar and decided to give him credit for his demise out of a generous gesture to repay his aid in the takeover of Ba Sing Se. Zuko, in disbelief accuses her of having an ulterior motive. Azula points out how letting him have all the glory over slaying the Avatar could do little to benefit her, but acknowledges the fact that should it be discovered that the Avatar was indeed alive, all that glory would swiftly turn into shame and foolishness.<ref name="The Awakening">{{cite episode|title=The Awakening|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=301|airdate=2007-09-21|season=3|number=1|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=301|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

[[Image:DontU4get.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Azula, Ty Lee, Mai, and Zuko stand together.]] <!-- Image has fair use rationale. See Image:Image:DontU4get.jpg -->

==== The Day of Black Sun ====
A few minutes after the beginning of the solar eclipse, as Aang, Toph, and Sokka manage to locate and burst into the Fire Lord's underground bunker, they are confounded to instead find Azula. She reveals that she's known about the invasion for months and is fully prepared to face and delay the attackers. Azula has two Dai Li agents she brought back from Ba Sing Se attack the trio while she runs away, closely pursued by Aang, Sokka and Toph. Once the agents have been defeated and Azula is cornered, Sokka realizes that she's merely wasting their time and that they should just forget her in favor of searching for Ozai. As they start to leave, Azula mentions Suki to Sokka, stating that she gave up hope on him ever rescuing her from her imprisonment. This revelation promptly makes Sokka charge at her in blind rage. Azula pulls out a shuriken, but Toph senses it and pins her to the wall. Sokka furiously demands to know where Suki is while Azula simply remains silent. When the eclipse ends, Azula breaks her restraints and coyly informs the trio of Ozai's precise location before running down the hall.<ref name="The Eclipse">{{cite episode|title=The Day of Black Sun Part 2: The Eclipse|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=311|airdate=2007-11-26|season=3|number=11|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=311|credits=Director: Joaquim dos Santos; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

== Personality ==
A dedicated nationalist, Azula relentlessly drills herself towards perfection and will settle for nothing less from herself or those that serve her. Even as a child she was seen to react with hostility when outdone. She is rather vain and believes that power and domination are what makes a person strong. 

She is also known for being one of the cruelest characters in the series. From a very young age, Azula demonstrated [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic]] aggression and lack of remorse, which suggest that Azula could be a [[sociopath]]—Toph, who can detect lies via vibrations in the environment, notes that Azula can lie with no physiological changes whatsoever, and Azula's own mother, Princess Ursa even remarked, "What is wrong with that child?” In "[[Zuko Alone]]", her first reaction to hearing of her uncle [[Uncle Iroh|Iroh]]'s son Lu Ten dying in battle is to wonder whether this now makes her father the heir to the throne. In a similarly cold-blooded comment, when hearing that Iroh is ending his two year siege of Ba Sing Se due to grief over his son's death, she dismisses him as a "loser and quitter". This cruel and seemingly total lack of compassion extends to all of her family, with the exclusion of her mother (although her primary reaction to their mother's disappearance is to use it to taunt Zuko). She grins maliciously when Zuko is burned and scarred by their father, and eagerly watched to see her father punished by her grandfather in "[[Zuko Alone]]". She also did not seem to care when her mother disappeared or when her grandfather died, instead only appreciating her father's dishonorable gall in stealing Iroh's birthright to the throne.  Her cruelty is apparently infamous and extreme; when Iroh accidentally ingests the poisonous White Jade flower in "[[The Cave of Two Lovers]], Zuko and Iroh decide that they would rather go seek help from the Earth Kingdom and face certain death than deal with the Fire Nation and be handed over to Azula. 

Azula's characteristic blue [[flame]]s symbolizes the power she possesses and constantly seeks to increase. Her [[apathy]] also accounts for her ability to create and direct [[lightning]], the "cold-blooded fire;" according to Iroh, the skill requires complete control of all emotion, which would not prove difficult for Azula with her one-track [[mentality]]. Despite all of this, she is an excellent tactician, regularly displaying perception and resourcefulness that allows her to take advantage of almost any situation. 

Ironically, for all her refinement and self-confidence, Azula does retain some unsureness. As a result of her sequestered life of royalty, Azula has come to develop a considerable amount of [[social ineptitude]], particularly in her uncertainty of how to act around boys. Her over-competitive nature surfaces during a [[Footvolley|Kuai ball]] game, and she later admits her jealously over how much attention Ty Lee receives from boys. 

===The Blue Dragon===
In "[[The Earth King]]," Zuko fell into a deep sleep and dreamed of himself as Fire Lord, counseled by two dragons. Grey DeLisle, the voice of Azula, voiced the [[Seiryu|blue dragon]] on the right of Zuko. Coincidentally, their ancestors [[Avatar Roku]] and Fire Lord Sozin owned a red dragon and blue dragon respectively.<ref name="The Avatar And The Firelord">{{cite episode|title=The Avatar and the Firelord|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=306|airdate=2007-10-24|season=3|number=6|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=306|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

==Abilities==
Azula is revealed to be proficient in the highly difficult technique of creating and guiding lightning, a sub-skill of Firebending, and was the first character within the show to demonstrate its creation.<ref name="The Avatar State">{{cite episode|title=The Avatar State|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=201|airdate=2006-03-17|season=2|number=1|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=201|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writers: Aaron Ehasz, Elizabeth Welch Ehasz, Tim Hedrick, John O'Bryan|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>


The second most noticeable feature of Princess Azula's bending is her ability to create characteristic [[Firebending#Blue fire|blue flames]], which are more intense than the red, orange and yellow fire normally used by Firebenders. In "[[Return to Omashu]]" Azula was seen using flames in previously unseen ways, such as jets of flames, whirling disks, and blades of fire.<ref name="Return To Omashu">{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=203|airdate=2006-04-07|season=2|number=3|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=203|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
Also notable is her ability to produce a greater amount flames than most Firebenders without tiring, as she is shown to be able to maintain successive assaults for long durations of time. She has also demonstrated the skill to condense her flames, enabling her fire to cut clean through various objects. When formed into fireballs, the flames serve to be rather concussive, able to firmly pulverize objects such as stone. Azula is able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames which withstood the full force of four simultaneous elemental attacks.<ref name="The Chase">{{cite episode|title=The Chase|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=208|airdate=2006-05-26|season=2|number=8|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=208|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writer: Joshua Hamilton|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
She is even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, as was seen during her fight with Aang in "[[The Drill]]."<ref name="The Drill">{{cite episode|title=The Drill|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=213|airdate=2006-09-15|season=2|number=13|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=213|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
The depth of Azula's potential came to a head in "[[The Crossroads of Destiny]]," where she is shown using her flames to propel herself forward almost similar to a jet.<ref name="The Crossroads of Destiny">{{cite episode|title=The Crossroads of Destiny|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=220|airdate=2006-12-01|season=2|number=20|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=220|credits=Director: Michael Dante DiMartino; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>


She is also a skilled actress, which she uses often to deceive or trick the enemy, seen especially in "[[The Crossroads of Destiny]]", when she pretended to be afraid of Long Feng when purposely captured by the Dai Li.<ref name="The Crossroads of Destiny">{{cite episode|title=The Crossroads of Destiny|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=220|airdate=2006-12-01|season=2|number=20|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=220|credits=Director: Michael Dante DiMartino; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
She has great self control, and is said to be "terrifying and inspirational" at the same time.<ref name="The Crossroads of Destiny">{{cite episode|title=The Crossroads of Destiny|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=220|airdate=2006-12-01|season=2|number=20|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=220|credits=Director: Michael Dante DiMartino; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
So composed is Azula that she is capable of lying without making even the slightest physical reaction.<ref name="The Eclipse">{{cite episode|title=The Day of Black Sun Part 2: The Eclipse|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=311|airdate=2007-11-26|season=3|number=11|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=311|credits=Director: Joaquim dos Santos; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
It is due to her fighting prowess, mastery of Firebending, conniving mind, and her pursuit of absolute perfection that Azula managed to conquer Ba Sing Se where everyone else had failed.

== Relationships ==
=== Mai ===
Throughout their childhood, Azula was known for trickery, such as causing her brother Zuko to fall with Mai into the water in order to laugh at them.<ref name="Zuko Alone">{{cite episode | title = Zuko Alone | episodelink = Zuko Alone | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-05-12 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 7}}</ref>

Mai does not necessarily fear Azula, as shown in the episode "[[The Drill]]," where Mai refused an order from Azula to chase Sokka and Katara in the drill's waste system ("She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me - I am ''not'' going in that wall sludge juice").<ref name="The Drill">{{cite episode|title=The Drill|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=213|airdate=2006-09-15|season=2|number=13|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=213|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
In another occasion, she also allows Sokka, Toph and the Earth King free to escape with the king's pet bear Bosco in "[[The Crossroads of Destiny]]", either due to the fact she didn't feel like fighting them or that she didn't want to deal with Bosco anymore.<ref name="The Crossroads of Destiny">{{cite episode|title=The Crossroads of Destiny|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=220|airdate=2006-12-01|season=2|number=20|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=220|credits=Director: Michael Dante DiMartino; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
However, these incidents have occurred in the absence of Azula; it is not known how Mai would have acted if she was around. Also, in "[[The Headband]]", after Azula interrupts her moment with Zuko, Mai sends a glare at Azula while her back is turned.<ref name="The Headband">{{cite episode|title=The Headband|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=302|airdate=2007-09-28|season=3|number=2|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=302|credits=Director: Joaquim dos Santos; Writer: John O'Brien|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

===Ty Lee===
Like Mai, Ty Lee regards Azula as a friend and even openly displays admiration for her, but ever since they were both children, she hasn't treated Ty Lee as such.<ref name="Zuko Alone">{{cite episode | title = Zuko Alone | episodelink = Zuko Alone | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-05-12 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 7}}</ref> Because Azula cannot stand to be "number two", even as a child, she shoved Ty Lee to the ground when she could do acrobatic flips that Azula couldn't.<ref name="Zuko Alone">{{cite episode | title = Zuko Alone | episodelink = Zuko Alone | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-05-12 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 7}}</ref>
Azula also bullied an unwilling Ty Lee into joining her search for the Avatar, her brother, and uncle while she was doing a performance.<ref name="Return To Omashu">{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=203|airdate=2006-04-07|season=2|number=3|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=203|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

Despite this, Azula has been known to be occasionally respectful and somewhat caring toward Ty Lee.  When she makes Ty Lee cry by telling her that no boy cares for her as a person, she apologizes quickly and even admits that it was her own insecurity that shaped that comment, proving that even she can care when she feels like it.<ref name="The Beach">{{cite episode|title=The Beach|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=305|airdate=2007-10-19|season=3|number=5|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=305|credits=Director: Joaquim dos Santos; Writer: Katie Mattila|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
