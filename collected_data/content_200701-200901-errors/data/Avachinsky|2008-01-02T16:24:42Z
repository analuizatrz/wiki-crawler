'''Avachinsky''' (also known as '''Avacha''' or '''Avacha Volcano''' or '''Avachinskaya Sopka''') ({{lang-ru|Авачинская сопка, Авача}}) is an active [[volcano]] on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in the far east of [[Russia]].  It lies within sight of the capital of [[Kamchatka Krai]], [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]].  Together with neighbouring [[Koryaksky]] volcano, it has been designated a [[Decade Volcano]], worthy of particular study in light of its history of explosive eruptions and proximity to populated areas.

==Geological history==

Avachinsky lies on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], at a point where the [[Pacific Plate]] is sliding underneath the [[Eurasian Plate]] at a rate of about 80&nbsp;mm/year.  A wedge of [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] material lying between the [[subduction|subducting]] Pacific Plate and the overlying Eurasian Plate is the source of dynamic volcanism over the whole Kamchatka Peninsula.

The volcano is one of the most active volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and began erupting in the middle to late [[Pleistocene]] era.  It has a horseshoe-shaped [[caldera]], which formed 30-40,000 years ago in a major [[landslide]] which covered an area of 500&nbsp;km² south of the volcano, underlying the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.  Reconstruction of a new cone inside the caldera occurred in two major eruption phases, 18,000 and 7,000 years ago.

==Recent activity==

Avachinsky has erupted at least 17 times in recorded history.  Eruptions have generally been explosive, and [[pyroclastic flow]]s and [[lahar]]s have tended to be directed to the south west by the breached caldera.  The most recent large eruption ([[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]]=4) occurred in 1945, when about 0.25&nbsp;km³ of [[magma]] was ejected.  The volcano has since had small eruptions in 1991 and 2001.

The volcano continues to experience frequent [[earthquake]]s, and many [[fumarole]]s exist near the summit.  The temperature of gases emitted at these fumaroles has been measured at over 400°C.  In light of its proximity to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Avachinsky was designated a [[Decade Volcano]] in [[1996]] as part of the [[United Nations]]' International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, together with the nearby [[Koryaksky]] volcano.
