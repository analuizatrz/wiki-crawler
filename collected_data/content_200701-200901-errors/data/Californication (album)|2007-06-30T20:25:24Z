'''''Californication''''' is the seventh studio album by [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released on [[June 8]], [[1999]] on the [[Warner Music Group|Warner Bros.]] label. ''Californication'' saw [[John Frusciante]], who had previously appeared on ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' and ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', replace [[Dave Navarro]] as the band's guitarist. The album produced many hits for the band, including "[[Around the World (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Around the World]]", "[[Otherside]]", "[[Californication (song)|Californication]]" and [[Grammy]]-award winning "[[Scar Tissue]]".

''Californication'' was commercially successful, reaching #3 on the US [[Billboard 200]]. It is the Chili Peppers' best-selling album to date, and has sold more than fifteen million copies worldwide.<ref name="billboard">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers album chart history|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Billboard}}</ref><ref name="bbc">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3864401.stm|title=Chili Peppers' album tops survey|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The album marked a change in style for the the band; ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Greg Tate noted that "while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, ''Californication'' dares to be spiritual and epiphanal".<ref name="rsreview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/277669/californication|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Rolling Stone'' magazine|author=Greg Tate}}</ref>

The title ''Californication'' is sometimes mistaken as a [[portmanteau]] of "[[California]]" and "[[fornication]]". However, in an interview with [[MTV]] in 2000, band member [[Anthony Kiedis]] stated that it is a not a sexual reference and that "californication" is "the act of the world being affected and saturated by the art and the culture being born and raised in California".<ref name="mtvinterview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/c/chilisfeature99_1.jhtml|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: ''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=MTV}}</ref>

==Background==
Guitarist [[John Frusciante]] had departed from the band, mid-tour, in 1992, due to his growing hatred for the fame the Chili Peppers were receiving, attributed mainly in part to their critically acclaimed album ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]''.<ref> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 295</ref> While the band attempted to regain confidence, it took over a year before they found a new guitarist to officially begin recording with. [[Dave Navarro]], formerly of [[Jane's Addiction]], was invited to the band after Arik Marshall, who had finished the tour with the Chili Peppers, was fired.<ref> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 307</ref> Navarro influenced the band's ensuing album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', by incorporating various elements of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock]]<ref name=AMGOHM>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fpfwxq9hldfe|title=''One Hot Minute'' review - by Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=All Music Guide.}}</ref>, which was something that the Chili Peppers had not previously been notable for. ''One Hot Minute'' was a commercial success, selling roughly five million copies, but a let down compared to ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 344, 358, 401.</ref> Critics, however, dismissed the album as weak and unfocused. <ref name=AMGOHM/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/biography|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Biography|accessdate=2007-06-25|publisher=''Rolling Stone Magazine''}}</ref> Shortly after the release of ''One Hot Minute'', Navarro was fired from the band due to internal differences. <ref>Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; pages 361–377</ref>

In the years following former guitarist John Frusciante's departure from the band, it became known that he had developed a heroin addiction that left him in poverty and near death.<ref name="redux">{{cite web| author=Skanse, Richard| url

==Writing and composition==
[[Image:rhcpcalifornication1.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Frusciante]]'s (third from left) return to the Red Hot Chili Peppers marks a change from their previous album. Left to right: Anthony Kiedis, Flea, John Frusciante, Chad Smith.]]
A considerable amount of the album's formation took place in the band member's homes in the summer of 1998. Kiedis and Frusciante often spent days together at each other's home, discussing song creation, guitar riffs and lyrical content. Much of the instrumental formation was pieced together through jam sessions, although this unrestricted nature was not present in the finished album which  favored a more structured song configuration.<ref> Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; pages 401–406</ref>

While most of the album progressed rapidly, "Californication" itself remained a difficult song to put together. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble to accompany the powerful lyrics, but encountered difficulty.<ref>Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; page 407</ref> The song was barely making progress, and was nearly scrapped had it not been for Kiedis' urgency to include it on the album. Only two days before the album’s initial recording ended did Frusciante set the final riff into place, and taught the rest of the band how to perform it. "Californication" is, essentially, a detailed classification of California, and, more specifically, the "fake" nature which is associated with much of [[Hollywood]].

''Californication's'' lyrics were derived from Anthony Kiedis' ideas, outlooks, and perceptions of life and its meaning. "Porcelain" resulted after Kiedis met a young mother at the [[YMCA]], who was attempting to battle her alcohol addiction whilst living with her infant daughter.<ref> Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; page 404</ref> Sarcasm had also been lingering in his mind for quite some time and he decided to devote an entire song to the concept. Kiedis found inspiration from former band mate [[Dave Navarro]], who he considered the "King of Sarcasm".<ref> Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; page 409</ref> Frusciante began playing a poignant guitar riff, which Kiedis immediately saw integrating smoothly into "Scar Tissue". Running outside with joy, he saw birds flying gracefully overhead which inspired the lyric, "With the birds I'll share this lonely view".<ref> Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; page 408</ref>{{Sound sample box align left|[[Californication (album)|Californication]] samples:}}
{{Listen|filename=Red Hot Chili Peppers - Around the World.ogg|title="Around the World"|description=Sample of "Around the World", the second single from ''Californication'', which combined hard, abrasive guitar progressions with a deeply melodic chorus. |format=[[Ogg]]}} {{Listen|filename=Red Hot Chili Peppers - Otherside.ogg|title="Otherside" | description=Sample of "Otherside", the fourth single from ''Californication'', which was one of the darkest recordings following ''One Hot Minute''.|format=[[Ogg]]}}{{sample box end}}

The recording was a change of style for the Chili Peppers, especially when compared to their previous album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', which combined various elements of [[psychedelic rock]] and [[Hard Rock|hard rock]]. Although ''Californication'' still contained their once essential "punk funk" trademark sound (such as "Purple Stain", "Get On Top", "I Like Dirt", "Around the World", and "Right on Time"), it leaned towards more melodic oriented melodies (for example, "[[Scar Tissue]]" and "[[Otherside]]") and focused on songs with implemented structure rather than [[jam session|jams]]. [[Alternative rock]] was tangible in tracks like "Easily" and "Emit Remmus".<ref name="rsgreatest" /> This change was attributed by Greg Prato of [[All Music Guide]] to the return of Frusciante to the lineup.<ref name="music.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.music.com/release/californication/1/|title=''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=music.com|year=2004|author=Greg Prato}}</ref>

His return came with a more experimental style; one song in particular, "Emit Remmus", features a repeating guitar riff which was recorded backwards (hence the title "Emit Remmus", "Summer Time" backwards). Experimental guitar work is consistent in  "Savior", and “This Velvet Glove”, as a [[Mellotron]] and other distortion methods were employed. The album includes multiple references to drugs and [[Hollywood]].<ref name="eweekly">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64068,00.html|title=''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|year=1999|author=David Browne}}</ref>

==Release==
The band played the songs "Scar Tissue", "Otherside", and "Californication" to their managers, in early 1999, where it was decided that "Scar Tissue" would be the lead single for the album.<ref name=srtisspg422> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 422.</ref> To support their reunited line-up, the band played various proms across the country in order to promote ''Californication''.<ref name=srtisspg422/> It sprouted a competition, which called upon high school students to write essays on "...how they could make their schools better, safer, happier, more rocking places, so that they didn't have to go to school afraid. If you wrote the essay, you got a free ticket to the show".<ref name=srtisspg422/>

''Californication'' was released on [[CD]] on June 8, 1999, debuting at #5 but peaking at #3 on the [[Billboard Top 200]]<ref name="billboard"/>.

==Critical recognition==
''Californication'' managed to gain more critical acceptance than its less popular predecessor, ''One Hot Minute'', and was a greater success worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fpfwxq9hldfe|title=''One Hot Minute'' Album Review - Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: "[his] vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility".<ref name="rsreview"/> Songs such as "Otherside" and "Porcelain" were called "[[The Smashing Pumpkins|Pumpkins]]-esque", while the album as a whole was "epiphinal" and that the "RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick".<ref name="rsreview"/> Other critics credited the album's success to the return of Frusciante. [[AMG|All Music's]] Greg Prato said that the "obvious reason for [the band's] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante", considering him to be the "quintessential RHCP guitarist".<ref name=AMGCalif>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:a9fuxqykld0e|title=''Californication'' Review - Greg Prato|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> The album as a whole was "a bona fide Chili Peppers classic".<ref name=AMGCalif/> 

Pitchfork, while considering the album a triumph over ''One Hot Minute'', felt ''Californication'' lacked the funk that was ever-present in ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref name=pitchfrkreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/21277-californication|title=Californication Review - Brent DiCrescenzo|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=Pitchfork Media}}</ref> It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be "the best big- time American rock guitarist going right now".<ref name=pitchfrkreview/> 

The album received criticism for what Tim Anderson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called "excessive compression and distortion" in the process of digital remastering,<ref name="guardianquality">{{Cite web|url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/insideit/story/0,,1992466,00.html|title=How CDs are remastering the art of noise|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> and was the subject of an online petition which garnered over 1,000 signatures.<ref name="soundpetition">{{Cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com/RHCPWBCD/petition.html|title=Sound Quality petition|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Petition Online}}</ref> ''[[Stylus magazine]]'' labeled it as one of the victims of the [[loudness war]] and commented that it suffered from digital clipping so much that "even non-audiophile consumers complained about it".<ref>{{citeweb|title=''Californication'' Sound Quality|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/imperfect-sound-forever.htm|accessdate=2007-06-25|publisher=''Stylus Magazine''}}</ref>

==''Californication'' tour==
[[Image:Johnfrusciante1.jpg|125px|thumb|right|[[John Frusciante]] in a live musical event during the Californication tour.]]
Immediately following the release of ''Californication'', the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to play at [[Woodstock '99]] which became infamous for the violence that occurred there.<ref name=scrtisspg423>Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 423</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/red_hot_chili_peppers/bio.jhtml|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers bio|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=VH1.}}</ref> The band was informed minutes before arriving that there were out of control crowds and bonfires in the fields.<ref name=scrtisspg423/> The situation escalated when the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's song "Fire" to finish their set. The disruption turned into violence as several women who had been '[[crowd surfing]]' were raped and property was destroyed and looted.<ref>{{citeweb|Title=|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/woodstock27.htm|title=Woodstock '99 Goes Up in Smoke - Alona Wartofsky|accessdate=2007-06-28|publisher=''Washington Post''}}</ref><ref>Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 424</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title=Police investigate alleged rapes at Woodstock '99|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9907/29/woodstock.rape/|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title="Repeated Violence"|publisher=The Lantern|

To kick off the band's European tour, the Chili Peppers staged a free show in [[Moscow|Moscow's]] [[Red Square]], on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000. <ref name=scrtisspage426/> Kiedis recalled of the situation: "Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that we needed a police escort to get near the stage."<ref name=scrtisspage426>Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 426</ref> Following the leg, the group did a show in [[New York City]], at the [[Windows on the World]], for [[K-Rock]] radio contest winners, then [[Big Day Out]] in Australia following several Japanese tour dates.<ref>Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 427.</ref> Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring and the band set up concerts which would be less strenuous to the foursome, but, consequently, less prosperous, financially; it would finish out ''Californication's'' ensuing tour.<ref> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue'';page 435</ref> As one of the last shows before the release of ''[[By the Way]]'', the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/robbiewilliams/articles/story/5923718/really_randoms_robbie_williams_eminem|title="Really Randoms" Nov 01, 2000 (paragraph 9)|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=''Rolling Stone Magazine''}}</ref>
