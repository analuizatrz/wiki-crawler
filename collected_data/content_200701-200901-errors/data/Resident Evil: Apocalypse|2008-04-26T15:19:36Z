==Plot summary==
The film begins with [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] ([[Milla Jovovich]]) recalling the key events from the [[Resident Evil (film)|first film]]. On [[September 29]], [[2002]], thirteen hours after the [[Viruses in the Resident Evil series#T Virus|initial T-Virus outbreak]] in The Hive, the [[Umbrella Corporation]] sends in a research team to re-open the complex. As the team enters The Hive through a secret insertion point beneath [[Raccoon City]], the entire team is slaughtered by [[zombie]]s and Lickers who have been sealed within the complex. Realizing the entrance is now open, and the virus and infectious zombies will make their way to the surface,  Umbrella establishes a security perimeter around the city to keep the citizens in a quarantined area. 

As civilians reach the checkpoints, Umbrella operatives screen them for traces of any infection, until [[Major Timothy Cain]] ([[Thomas Kretschmann]]), orders all checkpoints to be closed as the infection already reached the gates and informs remaining citizens to return to their homes. Meanwhile, Alice wakes up in a downtown hospital, and recalls her recent memories. After surviving The Hive, Alice was recovered by Umbrella and used for experimentation. She has gained superhuman powers because the T-Virus bonded with her blood on a cellular level. As she exits the hospital, she recognizes the virus has escaped causing devastation in the streets and makes her way to a police car where she grabs a shotgun from the front seat.

Elsewhere, [[Carlos Olivera]] ([[Oded Fehr]]) and two other Umbrella soldiers Nicholai Ginovaef ([[Zack Ward]]) and Yuri Loginova link up with multiple [[S.T.A.R.S. (Resident Evil)|Special Tactics And Rescue Service]] units in an attempt to hold against an onslaught of zombies in the street. However they are overrun, causing Carlos and his team to fall back with a infected Yuri who was bitten during the battle. [[Jill Valentine (Resident Evil film)|Jill Valentine]] ([[Sienna Guillory]]) (a S.T.A.R.S. unit member) together with [[Terri Morales]] ([[Sandrine Holt]]) and [[Peyton Wells]] ([[Razaaq Adoti]]) retreat to a church, where they are attacked by [[List of Resident Evil creatures#Licker|Licker]]s before being saved by Alice.

When the infection reached critical stages, Umbrella dispatched their [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis program]] ([[Matthew G. Taylor]]) to kill all remaining S.T.A.R.S. operatives, and when he encounters [[L.J. (Resident Evil)|L.J.]] ([[Mike Epps]]), and thirteen other members of S.T.A.R.S, they open fire on him, before he guns them down, sparing only L.J.'s life when he drops his weapons. [[Dr. Charles Ashford]] ([[Jared Harris]]), a key Umbrella scientist and creator of the T-Virus, has refused extraction by Umbrella until he has located and rescued his daughter [[Angela Ashford|Angela]] ([[Sophie Vavasseur]]). As he hacks into Raccoon City's network of closed circuit cameras, he determines she is hiding out in her school and contacts Alice and her group.  He informs them that Umbrella's method of sanitizing Raccoon City is by nuking it, but he offers to arrange for an evacuation in exchange for rescuing Angela. Inside the school, the group encounter Carlos and his team, who have also been given the same offer. After various encounters with [[List of Resident Evil creatures#Cerberus or Zombie Dog|zombie dogs]] and infected children who kill Terri and Nicholai respectively, they succeed in finding Angela, leaving the remaining survivors to escape and head towards the extraction point.

When contacted by Alice about their success, Ashford gives them the location of the extraction point, before being intervened by Major Cain, who had been aware of his plan, and captures him before killing him forcing Alice to fight Nemesis. As she defeats Nemesis, she realizes his true identity (her former friend, [[Matt Addison]]) and refuses to deliver the killing blow. Her mercy appears to rekindle a trace of Nemesis's former humanity, and they join forces and attack the Umbrella troops. Nemesis is killed in the ensuing fight, and Alice and the others escape in the helicopter, leaving Major Cain on the ground. Major Cain picks up a pistol and fires it into the rapidly growing crowd of approaching zombies several times, then tries to kill himself with the pistol, only to find that it is out of bullets. He is eaten alive just before the missile reaches the city, and destroys it.

The helicopter is caught in the blast radius, and during that time, Alice is impaled by a loose piece of metal, that was dislodged as the shock wave hit the helicopter. The helicopter then crashes into the Arklay Mountains. Alice is recovered by Umbrella, while the rest of the occupants in the helicopter escaped before the crash site was located. Alice is then taken to the Chicago Umbrella research station, where, after several weeks. Alice awakens in a giant water tank, completely regenerated from her injuries. Led by Umbrella scientist [[Dr. Isaacs]] ([[Iain Glen]]), the doctors release and begin to question her. At first, she appears to have no memory, but soon a rapid series of images of recent events come flashing back in her mind, and she states with contempt "''My name is Alice… and I remember everything.''" She fights her way out of the facility showing some of her darkest powers yet, only to be surrounded by dozens of armed guards. Suddenly, Jill, Carlos, and L.J. pull up in a SUV, disguised as Umbrella employees. Carlos shows the guards a written order placing her in his custody. They allow Alice to go, and as she enters the waiting vehicle, she sees Angela in the back seat. As they drive away, Angela asks Alice if she is all right. Alice doesn't respond, and Dr. Isaacs is shown saying, "Program Alice Activated." A close-up of her eye shows a flashing Umbrella logo as the film comes to an end.

===Story development===
[[Image:Arklaymountainsfromapocalypse.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Arklay Mountains]] overlooking [[Raccoon City]].]]
In March 2002, it was revealed the film would borrow plot elements from ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', as the film's subtitle was revealed as being ''"Resident Evil: Nemesis"''.<ref name="Eric Mabius Talks Resident Evil 2"/> It was also revealed the film would include new characters from the video game series such as [[Jill Valentine]], [[Claire Redfield]], [[Carlos Olivera]], [[Dr. William Birkin]] and [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]].<ref name="Resident Evil 2 has a Subtitle">{{cite web | author=| year=2003| title=Resident Evil 2 has a Subtitle| format= | work=countingdown.com| url=http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=567433| accessdate = 2007-12-25}}</ref><ref name="Director Paul Anderson Announces New Cast Members"/><ref name="Director Paul Anderson's Update on Casting"/> In April 2003, it was confirmed that the story would begin minutes after the ending of the first film, where Alice is a survivor lurking amongst the ruins of [[Raccoon City]].<ref name="Production To Begin In July">{{cite web | author=| year=2003| title=Production To Begin In July| format= | work=countingdown.com| url=http://www.countingdown.com/movies/567549/news?item_id=3030369| accessdate = 2007-12-25}}</ref>
[[Image:Nemesis film.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Umbrella launching its ''[[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]]'' Program]]

The film borrowed numerous elements from the game series including re-enactments of certain scenes from the games, such as Alice running through a building with an Umbrella helicopter firing at her, up to the point where she drops her gun, falls, re-grabs it and fires, which is reminiscent to the introduction scene of ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica]]''.<ref name="DVD">{{cite video| people= Paul W.S. Anderson| title= ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse Commentary''| medium= DVD| publisher= Sony Entertainment| date= 2004}}</ref> Another scene involves where Raccoon City is overrun by zombies, and the police and [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]] mercenaries are fighting back, up to the point in which a zombie reflects off a fallen police helmet, which is reminiscent to the introduction scene of ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.''<ref name="DVD"/> Other scenes involve the launching a missile to  destroy Raccoon City and the attack at the graveyard scene.<ref name="DVD"/>

The film references ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'' such as the crash site of the helicopter being located in the [[Arklay Mountains|Arklay Forest]] near the Arklay Mountains, where the ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'' series first began.<ref name="DVD"/> Other similarities include Jill basing her moves from the first game.<ref name="DVD"/> The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death which is also recorded.<ref name="DVD"/> A white goddess statue can be seen in the church as artwork of goddesses has a large role within the puzzles in the ''Resident Evil'' series.<ref name="DVD"/> Whilst walking on the ''Arklay Overpass'', Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. The games themselves use a fixed camera perspective, and in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective.<ref name="DVD"/> Another similarity includes where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when you find ammo or weapons in certain areas.<ref name="DVD"/>

The film references ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' such as when Alice visits the gun shop which is similar to Kendo's Gun Shop.<ref name="DVD"/> Angela Ashford's character is based on [[Sherry Birkin]], as they are both children, dressed in school uniforms, and in need of rescue. Both of their fathers are also researchers working for Umbrella.<ref name="DVD"/> The Ashford name, however, comes from the founders of Umbrella revealed in ''Resident Evil : Code Veronica''. The film also references ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'' such as Jill wearing the same outfit. Nemesis is a character taken directly from the game, and also mentions "S.T.A.R.S." on numerous occasions.<ref name="DVD"/>

===Production===
Actors portraying zombies were trained at a zombie "[[boot camp]]" where they were coached to act as ''zen-zombies'' and ''liquid'' zombies. Anderson and other crew members intended to make the zombies move faster but decided that it would be breaking a fundamental element of the games.<ref name="DVD"/> The design for Nemesis' was to include an actor in a suit ([[Matthew G. Taylor]]) with only special-effects applied to certain parts of the characters body such as the eye.<ref name="DVD"/> 

The [[List of Resident Evil creatures#Licker|Lickers]] were fully computer-generated though the use of physical puppets was originally considered.<ref name="DVD"/> To avert issues faced during production, the CGI work of the lickers began early.<ref name="DVD"/> The film was filmed on location in Canada with the film entering [[pre-production]] stages in mid 2003, with [[principal photography]] to originally begin in July 2003,<ref name="Production To Begin In July"/> before being bumped up to [[August 6]], [[2003]].<ref name="Milla Jovovich To Return With New Director">
