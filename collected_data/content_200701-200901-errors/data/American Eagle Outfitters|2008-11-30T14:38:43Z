It was founded in 1977 by Mark and Jerry Silverman as a subsidiary of [[Retail Ventures|Retail Ventures, Inc.]], a company which also owned and operated [[Silverman's Menswear]]. The Silvermans sold their ownership interests in 1991.<ref>http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/American-Eagle-Outfitters-Inc-Company-History.html</ref>

==Other brands==
In addition to its namesake brand, the company has developed and announced plans for several new brand and concept initiatives poised to drive new growth as the brand nears saturation in current markets. {{Fact|date=November 2008}} 

The company's second stand-alone lifestyle concept, [[Martin + Osa]], launched in the fall of 2006, targets men and women from 28 to 40 years of age. It features Cashmere sweaters and casual clothing for a much older target audience. They also sell products by Fred Perry, Adidas, Onitsuka Tiger and HOBO International. <ref>{{Citation

In 1999, the company acquired a Canada-based retail concept called [[Bluenotes]], which has approximately 100 stores averaging 3,300 square feet. The concept targeted a slightly younger demographic, ages 12-25, and was positioned as a denim-driven urban/suburban lifestyle brand. Due largely to poor performance, the Bluenotes business was sold to YM Inc. in 2001. <ref>{{cite news

===77 kids===
American Eagle released plans in January 2008, to launch "'''77 kids'''," a line of clothing aimed at children from infant to 10 years. Online shopping is currently the only way to purchase 77 kids merchandise, but there are plans to open retail stores in the future. <ref>{{cite press release

==Controversies==
===Strike===
In 2007, textile and apparel workers union [[UNITE HERE]] launched the "American Vulture" back-to-school boycott of American Eagle <ref>http://www.americanvulture.org</ref> in protest of alleged workers' rights violations at the company's Canadian distribution contractor [[National Logistics Services]] (NLS). On the 2007 second quarter conference call<ref>[http://seekingalpha.com/article/45199-american-eagle-outfitters-f2q07-qtr-end-8-4-07-earnings-call-transcript American Eagle Outfitters F2Q07 (Qtr End 8/4/07) Earnings Call Transcript - Seeking Alpha<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, CEO James O'Donnell clarified the American Eagle's relationship with NLS and its effect on business. He explained, "We owned NLS with the acquisition of Braemar back in 2000 and we subsequently sold off NLS in 2006, and we are currently a customer of NLS... We have really no involvement at all with Unite Here and NLS. Our only involvement with NLS is basically as a customer and there have been some allegations made I think to some of, to the public about it affecting our business. I can tell you right now it has not affected our business."
===Abercrombie & Fitch Lawsuits===
Since 1998, [[Abercrombie and Fitch]] has sued American Eagle Outfitters at least three times for copying its designs and advertisements.  Every time, American Eagle has prevailed, with courts telling Abercrombie that its designs are not able to be copyrighted.

==Company growth==
American Eagle expanded internationally by entering into [[Canada]]. A second store is open in the White Oaks Mall in London, Ontario, after acquiring some [[Dylex]] divisions in 2000 (Thrifty's, Braemar, & National Logistics). There are now American Eagle stores open all across Canada.

In 2006, 42 new American Eagle stores opened and 65 remodels were completed. Together with five new MARTIN + OSA stores and three new aerie stand-alone test stores, total gross square footage increased 8% for the year. In 2007, the company plans to open 45 to 50 more American Eagle, at least 15 aerie stand-alone, and approximately 12 new MARTIN + OSA stores. Additionally, approximately 45 American Eagle store remodels are planned which, combined with new store openings, will generate total 2007 square footage growth of approximately 10%.<ref>[http://seekingalpha.com/article/45199-american-eagle-outfitters-f2q07-qtr-end-8-4-07-earnings-call-transcript American Eagle Outfitters F2Q07 (Qtr End 8/4/07) James V.
