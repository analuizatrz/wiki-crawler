'''RNA interference''' (also called "[[RNA]]-mediated interference", but abbreviated '''RNAi''') is a mechanism for RNA-guided regulation of [[gene expression]] that is common in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. RNAi involves [[RNA#Double-stranded RNA|double-stranded ribonucleic acid]] (dsRNA) interfering with the [[Gene expression|expression]] of [[gene]]s with sequences [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to this dsRNA. 

The most well-studied outcome of RNAi is a form of post-transcriptional [[gene silencing]] where an [[antisense RNA]] strand marks a [[messenger RNA]] for degradation by a [[ribonuclease]]. The ribonuclease-containing multi-protein complex ([[RNA-induced silencing complex|RISC]]) that carries out the degradation reaction is conserved across the eukaryotic [[Three-domain system|domain]], as is the [[enzyme]] [[Dicer]] that processes dsRNA to the short (about 24 [[nucleotide]]s long) fragments that target RNAs for destruction. In cells, the fragments of double-stranded RNA that initiate the RNAi process often come from pre-[[microRNA]]s, RNA molecules that are involved in [[gene regulation]]. 

The ability of RNAi to dramatically and selectively reduce the expression of an individual [[gene]] makes RNAi a valuable ''in vivo'' laboratory research tool, both in [[cell culture]] and in multicellular organisms. Synthetic dsRNA can be added to cells in order to artificially induce RNAi. RNAi can also be used for large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell. This can help identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division. RNAi is also a promising therapy in [[human disease]]. RNAi has been particularly well-studied in certain organisms such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', in which the gene silencing [[phenotype]] is heritable, in ''[[Drosophila]]'', and in plants where the effect can spread from cell to cell within the organism.

Historically, RNA interference was known by other names, including [[post transcriptional gene silencing]], transgene silencing, and quelling. Only after these apparently-unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear they all described the RNAi phenomenon. Well before RNAi was discovered, RNA was used to reduce gene expression in plant genetics. Single-stranded [[antisense RNA]] was introduced into plant cells and [[hybridize]]d to the homologous single-stranded "sense" [[messenger RNA]].<ref name=Ecker_1986>{{cite journal |author=Ecker JR, Davis RW |title=Inhibition of gene expression in plant cells by expression of antisense RNA |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=83 |issue=15 |pages=5372-5376 |year=1986 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/83/15/5372 | id=PMID 16593734}}</ref> In 2006, [[Andrew Fire]] and [[Craig C.

===dsRNA cleavage===
RNAi is an RNA-dependent [[gene silencing]] process that is mediated by the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC) and is initiated by the activity of the [[ribonuclease]] protein [[Dicer]],<ref name="Bernstein">{{cite journal |author=Bernstein E, Caudy A, Hammond S, Hannon G |title=Role for a bidentate ribonuclease in the initiation step of RNA interference |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6818 |pages=363-6 |year=2001 |id=PMID 11201747}}</ref> which binds and cleaves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules to produce double-stranded fragments of 20-25 [[base pair]]s with a few unpaired overhang bases on each end.<ref name="Vermeulen">{{cite journal |author=Vermeulen A, Behlen L, Reynolds A, Wolfson A, Marshall W, Karpilow J, Khvorova A |title=The contributions of dsRNA structure to Dicer specificity and efficiency |journal=RNA |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=674-82 |year=2005 |id=PMID 15811921}}</ref> These short double-stranded fragments are called small interfering RNAs ([[siRNA]]s), which are separated into single strands and integrated into an active RISC complex. After integration into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and induce cleaveage of the mRNA, thereby preventing it from being used as a [[translation (genetics)|translation]] template. 

The detection and binding of exogenous dsRNA is mediated by an effector protein, known as RDE-4 in ''[[C. elegans]]'' and R2D2 ''[[Drosophila]]'', that differentially binds long rather than short dsRNA molecules via a mechanism that has not yet been determined and is required for native levels of Dicer activity.<ref name="Parker">{{cite journal |author=Parker G, Eckert D, Bass B |title=RDE-4 preferentially binds long dsRNA and its dimerization is necessary for cleavage of dsRNA to siRNA |journal=RNA |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=807-18 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16603715}}</ref> These proteins then facilitate the subsequent transfer of cleaved siRNA to the RISC complex.<ref name="Liu2003">{{cite journal |author=Liu Q, Rand T, Kalidas S, Du F, Kim H, Smith D, Wang X |title=R2D2, a bridge between the initiation and effector steps of the Drosophila RNAi pathway |journal=Science |volume=301 |issue=5641 |pages=1921-5 |year=2003 |id=PMID 14512631}}</ref>

===RISC activation and catalysis===
The catalytically-active components of the RISC complex are [[endonuclease]]s, which cleave the target mRNA strand [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to their bound siRNA. In animals these nucleases are known as [[argonaute]] proteins. As the fragments produced by Dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, only one of the two strands - known as the ''guide strand'' - binds the argonaute protein and leads to gene silencing. The other ''anti-guide strand'' or ''passenger strand'' is degraded during the process of RISC activation.<ref name="Gregory">{{cite journal |author=Gregory R, Chendrimada T, Cooch N, Shiekhattar R |title=Human RISC couples microRNA biogenesis and posttranscriptional gene silencing |journal=Cell |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=631-40 |year=2005 |id=PMID 16271387}}</ref> Although it was first believed that an [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent [[helicase]] separated the two strands,<ref name=Lodish>{{cite book | authors = Lodish H, Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipurksy SL, Darnell J | title = Molecular Cell Biology | edition = 5th ed. | publisher = WH Freeman: New York, NY | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mcb.TOC | id = ISBN 978-0716743668}}</ref> the process is actually ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC.<ref name="Matranga">{{cite journal |author=Matranga C, Tomari Y, Shin C, Bartel D, Zamore P |title=Passenger-strand cleavage facilitates assembly of siRNA into Ago2-containing RNAi enzyme complexes |journal=Cell |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=607-20 |year=2005 |id=PMID 16271386}}</ref><ref name="Leuschner">{{cite journal |author=Leuschner P, Ameres S, Kueng S, Martinez J |title=Cleavage of the siRNA passenger strand during RISC assembly in human cells |journal=EMBO Rep |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=314-20 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16439995}}</ref> The strand selected as the guide tends to be the strand whose [[5' end]] is more stable, but strand selection is not dependent on the direction in which Dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation;<ref name="Preall">{{cite journal |author=Preall J, He Z, Gorra J, Sontheimer E |title=Short interfering RNA strand selection is independent of dsRNA processing polarity during RNAi in Drosophila |journal=Curr Biol |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=530-5 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16527750}}</ref> instead, the R2D2 protein's binding orientation may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the less-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.<ref name="Tomari">{{cite journal |author=Tomari Y, Matranga C, Haley B, Martinez N, Zamore P |title=A protein sensor for siRNA asymmetry |journal=Science |volume=306 |issue=5700 |pages=1377-80 |year=2004 |id=PMID 15550672}}</ref> The structural basis of the argonaute protein binding preference has been elucidated by [[X-ray crystallography]] of the binding [[structural domain|domain]] of an RNA-bound argonaute protein, suggesting that the [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] 5' end of the RNA strand binds a [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] [[basicity|basic]] surface [[binding site|pocket]] stabilized by contact with a [[divalent]] [[cation]] such as [[magnesium]] and by [[aromaticity|aromatic]] [[stacking (chemistry)|stacking]] interactions between 5' nucleotide in the siRNA and a conserved [[tyrosine]] residue.

===Relationship to microRNA===
RNA interference shares its cellular mechanism with processing of [[genome|genomically]] encoded [[microRNA]] (miRNA) and the resulting [[translation|translational repression]]. The phenomenon of RNA interference, broadly defined, includes the endogenously induced gene silencing effected by miRNA as well as exogenously induced gene silencing triggered by foreign dsRNA. SiRNAs derived from long dsRNA precursors do differ from miRNAs in that miRNA molecules typically have incomplete base pairing to a target and inhibit or downregulate the translation of many mRNA molecules with similar sequences, whereas siRNAs (particularly those deliberately introduced in a laboratory setting) typically base-pair perfectly to induce mRNA cleavage only in a specific target.<ref name=Pillai_2006>{{cite journal | author = Pillai RS, Bhattacharyya SN, Filipowicz W | title = Repression of protein synthesis by miRNAs: how many mechanisms? | journal = Trends Cell Biol | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = | id = PMID 17197185}}</ref>  <!-- this needs clarification; is this true of eg exogenous viral RNA? --> Similar to exogenous siRNA, miRNA activity is clustered in [[P-bodies|GW bodies]], whose size fluctuates depending on the phase of the [[cell cycle]]; miRNAs are major regulators of cell cycle progression and [[cell proliferation]].<ref name="Lian">{{cite journal |author=Lian S, Jakymiw A, Eystathioy T, Hamel J, Fritzler M, Chan E |title=GW bodies, microRNAs and the cell cycle |journal=Cell Cycle |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=242-5 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16418578}}</ref> In ''[[Drosophila]]'', miRNA and siRNA have been observed to be differentially processed by distinct argonaute proteins<ref name="Okamura">{{cite journal |author=Okamura K, Ishizuka A, Siomi H, Siomi M |title=Distinct roles for Argonaute proteins in small RNA-directed RNA cleavage pathways |journal=Genes Dev |volume=18 |issue=14 |pages=1655-66 |year=2004 |id=PMID 15231716}}</ref> and dicer enzymes.<ref name="Lee">{{cite journal |author=Lee Y, Nakahara K, Pham J, Kim K, He Z, Sontheimer E, Carthew R |title=Distinct roles for Drosophila Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 in the siRNA/miRNA silencing pathways |journal=Cell |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=69-81 |year=2004 |id=PMID 15066283}}</ref>

===Variation among organisms===
Organisms vary in their cells' ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA interference are both systemic and heritable in plants and in ''[[C. elegans]]'', although not in ''[[Drosophila]]'' or [[mammal]]s due to the absence of [[RNA replicase]] in these organisms. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate through cells via the transfer of siRNAs through [[plasmodesmata]].<ref name=Lodish /> Some eukaryotic protozoa such as ''[[Leishmania]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' lack the RNAi pathway.<ref name=DaRocha_2004>{{cite journal | author = DaRocha W, Otsu K, Teixeira S, Donelson J | title = Tests of cytoplasmic RNA interference (RNAi) and construction of a tetracycline-inducible T7 promoter system in Trypanosoma cruzi | journal = Mol Biochem Parasitol | volume = 133 | issue = 2 | pages = 175-86 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 14698430}}</ref><ref name=Robinson_2003>{{cite journal | author = Robinson K, Beverley S | title = Improvements in transfection efficiency and tests of RNA interference (RNAi) approaches in the protozoan parasite Leishmania | journal = Mol Biochem Parasitol | volume = 128 | issue = 2 | pages = 217-28 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12742588}}</ref>

==Biological origins==

For miRNAs, certain parts of the genome are [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into short RNA molecules that fold back on themselves in a hairpin shape to create a double strand primary miRNA structure ([[miRNA|pri-miRNA]]). The Dicer enzyme then cuts 20-25 nucleotides from the base of the hairpin to release the mature miRNA. If this miRNA base-pairs with a target mRNA this may result in its cleavage.  This is quite similar to the siRNA function, however, many miRNA's will base pair with mRNA with an imperfect match. In such cases, the miRNA causes the inhibition of translation and prevents normal function. Consequently, the RNAi machinery is important to regulate [[Endogenous#Biology|endogenous gene]] activity. This effect was first described for the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' in 1993.<ref name=Lee_1993>{{cite journal |author=Lee R, Feinbaum R, Ambros V |title=The C. elegans heterochronic gene lin-4 encodes small RNAs with antisense complementarity to lin-14 |journal=Cell |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=843-54 |year=1993 |id=PMID 8252621}}</ref> In plants, this mechanism was first shown in the "JAW microRNA" of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]''; it is involved in the regulation of several genes that control the plant's shape.<ref name=Palatnik_2003>{{cite journal |author=Palatnik J, Allen E, Wu X, Schommer C, Schwab R, Carrington J, Weigel D |title=Control of leaf morphogenesis by microRNAs |journal=Nature |volume=425 |issue=6955 |pages=257-63 |year=2003 |id=PMID 12931144}}</ref> Genes have been found in bacteria that are similar in the sense that they control mRNA abundance or translation by binding an mRNA by base pairing, however they are not generally considered to be miRNA's because the Dicer enzyme is not involved.<ref name=Morita_2006>{{cite journal |author=Morita T, Mochizuki Y, Aiba H |title=Translational repression is sufficient for gene silencing by bacterial small noncoding RNAs in the absence of mRNA destruction |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=103 |issue=13 |pages=4858-63 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16549791}}</ref> It has been suggested that [[CRISPR]] systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are [[homology (biology)|orthologous]].<ref name="makarova">{{cite journal |author=Makarova K, Grishin N, Shabalina S, Wolf Y, Koonin E |title=A putative RNA-interference-based immune system in prokaryotes: computational analysis of the predicted enzymatic machinery, functional analogies with eukaryotic RNAi, and hypothetical mechanisms of action |journal=Biol Direct |volume=1 |issue= |pages=7 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16545108}}</ref>

==Gene knockdown==
[[Image:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.]]
RNAi has recently been applied as an experimental technique to study the function of genes in [[model organism]]s. Double-stranded RNA synthesized with a sequence equivalent to a selected regions of a gene of interest is introduced into a cell or organism, where it can cause a drastic decrease gene expression. Studying the effects of this decrease can yield insights into the physiological role of the gene product. Since RNAi may not totally abolish expression of the gene, this technique is sometimes referred as a "[[Gene knockdown|knockdown]]", to distinguish it from "[[Gene knockout|knockout]]" procedures in which expression of a gene is entirely eliminated.

Most [[functional genomics]] applications of RNAi have used the [[nematode]] ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', which are common [[model organism]]s in genetics research.<ref name=Dzitoyeva_2003>{{cite journal |author=Dzitoyeva S, Dimitrijevic N, Manev H |title=Gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor 1 mediates behavior-impairing actions of alcohol in Drosophila: adult RNA interference and pharmacological evidence |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=100 |issue=9 |pages=5485-90 |year=2003 |id=PMID 12692303}}</ref> ''C. elegans'' is particularly useful for RNAi research because the effects of the gene silencing are generally heritable and because delivery of the dsRNA is experimentally simple. Through a mechanism whose details are poorly understood, bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that carry the desired dsRNA can be fed to the worms and will transfer their RNA payload to the worm via the intestinal tract. This "delivery by feeding" yields essentially the same magnitude of gene silencing as do more costly and time-consuming traditional delivery methods, such as soaking the worms in dsRNA solution and injecting dsRNA into the gonads.<ref name=Fortunato_2005>{{cite journal |author=Fortunato A, Fraser A |title=Uncover genetic interactions in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' by RNA interference |journal=Biosci Rep |volume=25 |issue=5-6 |pages=299-307 |year=2005 |id=PMID 16307378}}</ref>

==Crosstalk between RNA editing and RNA interference==
The type of [[RNA editing]] that is most prevalent in higher [[eukaryote]]s converts [[adenosine]] (A) residues into [[inosine]] (I) in double-stranded (ds)RNAs through the action of ADAR ([[adenosine deaminase]] acting on RNA) enzymes.<ref name=Bass_2002>{{cite journal |author=Bass B |title=RNA editing by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=71 |issue= |pages=817-46 |year=2002 |id=PMID 12045112}}</ref> The idea that the RNAi and A→I [[RNA editing]] pathways might compete for a common substrate dsRNA was originally proposed in 2000.<ref name=Bass_2000>{{cite journal |author=Bass B |title=Double-stranded RNA as a template for gene silencing |journal=Cell |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=235-8 |year=2000 |id=PMID 10847677}}</ref>  Recent studies showed that precursor RNAs of certain [[miRNA]]s indeed undergo A→I RNA editing<ref name=Luciano_2004>{{cite journal |author=Luciano D, Mirsky H, Vendetti N, Maas S |title=RNA editing of a miRNA precursor |journal=RNA |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=1174-7 |year=2004 |id=PMID 15272117}}</ref><ref name="yang2006">{{cite journal |author=Yang W, Chendrimada T, Wang Q, Higuchi M, Seeburg P, Shiekhattar R, Nishikura K |title=Modulation of microRNA processing and expression through RNA editing by ADAR deaminases |journal=Nat Struct Mol Biol |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=13-21 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16369484}}</ref> and this mechanism seems to regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs.<ref name="yang2006" /> Furthermore, one of the mammalian ADAR-family members can sequester siRNAs, thereby reducing the efficiency of RNAi.<ref name=Yang_2005>{{cite journal |author=Yang W, Wang Q, Howell K, Lee J, Cho D, Murray J, Nishikura K |title=ADAR1 RNA deaminase limits short interfering RNA efficacy in mammalian cells |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=280 |issue=5 |pages=3946-53 |year=2005 |id=PMID 15556947}}</ref> Lastly, analysis of ADAR-null ''C. elegans'' strains indicates that A→I RNA editing might counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.<ref name=Nishikura_2006>{{cite journal |author=Nishikura K |title=Editor meets silencer: crosstalk between RNA editing and RNA interference |journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=919-31 |year=2006 |id=PMID 17139332}}</ref>

Despite the proliferation of promising cell culture studies for RNAi-based drugs, some concern has been raised regarding the safety of RNA interference, especially the potential for "off-target" effects in which a gene with a coincidentally similar sequence to the targeted gene is also repressed.<ref name="Tong">{{cite journal |author=Tong A, Zhang Y, Nemunaitis J |title=Small interfering RNA for experimental cancer therapy |journal=Curr Opin Mol Ther |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=114-24 |year=2005 |id=PMID 15844618}}</ref> A computational genomics study estimated that the error rate of off-target interactions is about 10%.<ref name="Qiu">{{cite journal |author=Qiu S, Adema C, Lane T |title=A computational study of off-target effects of RNA interference |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=1834-47 |year=2005 |id=PMID 15800213}}</ref> One major study of liver disease in mice led to high death rates in the experimental animals, suggested by researchers to be the result of "oversaturation" of the dsRNA pathway.<ref name="Grimm">{{cite journal |author=Grimm D, Streetz K, Jopling C, Storm T, Pandey K, Davis C, Marion P, Salazar F, Kay M |title=Fatality in mice due to oversaturation of cellular microRNA/short hairpin RNA pathways |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=537-41 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16724069}}</ref>

== History ==
The discovery of RNAi was preceded by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant scientists in the USA and [[The Netherlands]].<ref name=Napoli_1990>{{cite journal |author=Napoli C, Lemieux C, Jorgensen R |title=Introduction of a Chimeric Chalcone Synthase Gene into Petunia Results in Reversible Co-Suppression of Homologous Genes in trans |journal=Plant Cell |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=279-289 |year=1990 |id=PMID 12354959}}</ref> In an attempt to alter [[flower]] colors in [[petunia]]s, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding a key enzyme for flower [[pigmentation]] into petunia plants. Surprisingly, many of the petunia plants carrying additional copies of this gene did not show the expected deep purple or deep red flowers but carried fully or partially white flowers. When the scientists had a closer look they discovered that both types of genes, the endogenous and the newly introduced transgenes, had been turned off. Evidence was obtained for posttranscriptional inhibition of gene expression that involved an increased rate of mRNA degradation.<ref name=Van_Blokland_1994>{{cite journal | author = Van Blokland R, Van der Geest N, Mol JNM, Kooter JM | title = Transgene-mediated suppression of chalcone synthase expression in ''Petunia hybrida'' results from an increase in RNA turnover | journal = Plant J | year = 1994 | volume = 6 | pages = 861&ndash;77 | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1994.6060861.x/abs/ }}</ref> This phenomenon was called ''co-suppression of gene expression'', but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.

A few years later plant virologists made a similar observation. In their research they aimed towards improvement of resistance of plants against plant viruses. At that time it was known that plants expressing virus-specific proteins show enhanced tolerance or even resistance against virus infection. However, they also made the surprising observation that plants carrying only short regions of viral RNA sequences not coding for any viral protein showed the same effect. They concluded that viral RNA produced by transgenes can also attack incoming viruses and stop them from multiplying and spreading throughout the plant.<ref name=Covey_1997>{{cite journal | author = Covey S, Al-Kaff N, Lángara A, Turner D | title = Plants combat infection by gene silencing | journal = Nature | year = 1997 | volume = 385 | pages = 781&ndash;2 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6619/abs/385781a0.html }}</ref> They did the reverse experiment and put short pieces of plant gene sequences into plant viruses. Indeed, after infection of plants with these modified viruses the expression of the targeted plant gene was suppressed. They called this phenomenon “virus-induced gene silencing” or simply “VIGS”. These phenomena are collectively called [[post transcriptional gene silencing]].<ref name=Ratcliff_1997>{{cite journal | author = Ratcliff F, Harrison B, Baulcombe D| title = A Similarity Between Viral Defense and Gene Silencing in Plants | journal = Science | year = 1997 | volume = 276 | pages = 1558&ndash;60 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/276/5318/1558 }}</ref>

After these initial observations in plants many laboratories around the world searched for the occurrence of this phenomenon in other organisms.  [[Craig C. Mello]] and [[Andrew Fire]]'s 1998 ''Nature'' paper based on research conducted with their colleagues (SiQun Xu, Mary Montgomery, Stephen Kostas, Sam Driver) at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] and the [[University of Massachusetts]] reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into ''[[C. elegans]]''.<ref name="Fire" /> In investigating the regulation of muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA and [[antisense RNA]] injections had an effect on protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term ''RNAi''.  The discovery of RNAi in ''C. elegans'' is particularly notable, as it represented the first identification of the causative agent (double stranded RNA) of this heretofore inexplicable phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2006 for their work.<ref name="Daneholt2006">{{cite web | title=Advanced Information: RNA interference | last=Daneholt | first=Bertil | work=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2006 | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2006/adv.html | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> <!--put Mello's RNA statement here if cited; I don't like leaving unsourced statements attributed to Nobel laureates in the main text-->
