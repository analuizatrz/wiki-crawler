The '''Cougar''' (''Felis concolor''), also known as the '''Puma''' or '''Mountain Lion''', is a large, solitary cat found in the [[Americas]]. It has a vast range, from [[Yukon]] Territory in [[Canada]] to the southern [[Andes]] of [[South America]]. Its primary food is [[deer]] but it hunts a range of prey, from [[insect]]s, [[mouse|mice]] and [[rabbit]]s to the [[cat|Domestic Cat]], the [[dog|Domestic Dog]], the [[Alpaca]], [[livestock]], and even the [[Bighorn Sheep]] and the [[Elk (Cervus canadensis)|Elk]], and sometimes in the Rocky Mountains kills mature [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s. It is a secretive cat that usually avoids people, very rarely attacking humans.<ref name=attacks>{{cite web | url = http://cougarinfo.com/attacks3.htm | title = List of Confirmed Cougar Attacks In the United States and Canada 2001 - Now}}</ref>

Due to overhunting and continual human development of Cougar habitat, populations have dropped in many parts of its historical range, although recent conservation efforts have allowed numbers to improve in some areas. However, hunting the Cougar is still common in the United States, and is permitted in every state from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean with the exception of California. The Cougar is typically hunted with dogs that chase the animal until it climbs a tree, whereupon the hunters shoot it. State agency records show that over 30,000 Cougars were killed for sport between 1996 and 2006, one of the highest totals for any decade on record.{{fact}}

In the English language the Cougar has over 40 different names. Cougars are known by many regional names, including '''Panther''', '''Catamount''', '''Painter''', '''American Lion''', '''Mexican Lion''', '''Florida Panther''', '''Silver Lion''', '''Red Lion''', '''Red Panther''', '''Red Tiger''', '''Brown Tiger''', '''Deer Tiger''', '''Ghost Cat''', '''Mountain Screamer''', '''Indian Devil''', '''Sneak Cat''', '''King Cat''', and '''Painted Cat'''. The word ''Puma'' comes from the [[Quechua language]]. In Brazil it is also known as the '''Suçuarana''', from the [[Tupi language]], but also has other names. 

In North America, particularly the [[United States]], "Panther" by itself refers to a Cougar when the context implies a local species. In South America, "Panther" refers to both the spotted and black color morphs of the [[Jaguar]].

There is a considerable variation in color and size of this animal across its large range of habitats. Adult weights can range from 145-200 pounds. However, in spite of anecdotal accounts of "[[black panther]]s" in the Cougar's range (and outside the Jaguar's), [[melanism]] has never been documented in the Cougar. Such anecdotal accounts are particularly prominent in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States, a region where ''P. concolor'' is accepted as having been wholly extirpated by the late 1800's, and where breeding populations have not been documented as re-established by 2005.

==Physical characteristics==
The Cougar is tawny colored with lighter patches on the under body including the jaws, chin, and throat, with some color variation from region to region. The Cougar can run as quickly as 70km/h (43.5&nbsp;mph), jump 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft) from a standing position, and vertically leap 2.5&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft). It has been seen to jump horizontally 12&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) and vertically nearly 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft). One Cougar was observed jumping 3.6m (12&nbsp;ft) up into a tree while still holding a deer in its jaws. Its bite strength is more powerful than that of any dog. Cougar claws are retractable and it has four toes. In North America, the Cougar is slightly larger than the [[Leopard]] and similar in size to the Jaguar; in South America, the Cougar is somewhat smaller. Adult males in North America may be more than 2.4&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) long (nose to tail), and have an average mass of about 60-70&nbsp;kg (approx. 150&nbsp;lb). Some in rare cases may reach over 120&nbsp;kg (260&nbsp;lb). One in particular which was shot in Arizona weighed 125&nbsp;kg (275&nbsp;lb), after it had had its intestines removed. Females are much smaller and an adult can be less than 2&nbsp;m (7&nbsp;ft) long and have a mass of about 35&nbsp;kg (weigh approx 75&nbsp;lb). Cougar kittens have brownish-blackish spots and rings on their tails. Their life span is about a decade in the wild and 25 years or more in captivity. Cougars that live closest to the [[equator]] are the smallest, and increase in size in populations closer to the [[geographical pole|poles]].

Though frequently lumped in with larger cats, the Cougar is distinct in that it cannot roar, and makes vocalizations much more common to small cats.

==Hybrids==
In spite of not being closely related to the [[pantherine (animal)|pantherine]] [[big cat]]s, hybrids between the Cougar and the Leopard have been bred and are called the [[Pumapard]]. Hybrids between the Cougar and the [[Ocelot]] have also been bred. Hybrids between the Cougar and the Jaguar have been reported, but none have been proven.

==Population and distribution==
The Cougar has the largest range of any wild cat. Before the modern human [[population explosion]] in the Americas, the Cougar ranged across most of the Americas. Even now, it has the widest range of any [[New World]] land animal, spanning 110 [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s of [[latitude]], from the northern [[Yukon]] Territory (in [[Canada]]) to the southern [[Andes]] (on both the [[Chilean]] and [[Argentinean]] sides). It has also been sighted recently in Northern [[Connecticut]] and other parts of [[New England]], however, sightings are not generally regarded as reliable enough to serve as scientific evidence.<ref>{{cite web | title = Beyond Sightings to Signs | work = [http://www.easterncougar.org Eastern Cougar Foundation] | url = http://www.easterncougar.org/beyondsightings.htm | date = 2006-09-26}}</ref>  One of the few locations where the Cougar is in great danger is within the United States, mainly [[Florida]] and other parts of the East Coast. This is mostly due to human infringement, clashing with cities and other urban advancements or because of the loss of territories that urbanization brings. When the Cougar is found and relocated to more "wild" parts of the state, it is put into competition with pre-existing populations.

===Cougar populations of the United States and Canada===
Hunted almost to extinction in the United States and eastern Canada, the Cougar has made a determined comeback, with an estimated 30,000 individuals in the western United States. In Canada, the Cougar is found west of the prairies, in [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]] and the southern Yukon. It is also found in smaller numbers within the [[Canadian Shield]] and river valley regions of [[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. The densest concentration of Cougars in North America is found on [[Vancouver Island]] in British Columbia, while in the United States the densest concentration is in the Ventana Wilderness in the Los Padres National Forest, California.<ref name=iucn/>

The Cougar is gradually extending its range to the east, following [[Creek (stream)|creek]]s and riverbeds, and has reached [[Missouri]], [[Michigan]] and [[Kansas]]. In [[Texas]], the Cougar is generally confined to the western 2/3 of the state. However, there have been Cougar sightings in 218 of the 254 Texas counties, with confirmed mortalities in 67 counties since 1983, an indication that it is expanding statewide to its historical range.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/mlion/ | title = Mountain Lion (''Puma concolor'') | work = [http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/ Texas Parks & Wildlife Department]}}</ref> There are continuing reports of the survival of a remnant population of the Eastern Cougar in [[New Brunswick]], Ontario and the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] of [[Quebec]].

In the eastern United States, rumors and myths of the Cougar never died, but this cat is slowly making its way from myth to reality — especially along the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from [[Virginia]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. There, Cougar sightings are steadily increasing, and a government bounty is offered in many places for confirmed sightings. One very compelling piece of evidence surfaced in June 1997, when a [[Kentucky]] man hit and killed a Cougar kitten with his truck. DNA analysis proved that the animal was descended in part from wild North American Cougars, and it showed no evidence of having been someone's escaped pet.<ref name=attacks/>

The sightings are not limited to the mountains either. Locals as far east as the Coastal Plain Region of North Carolina have reported sightings.<ref>Shaw, Rob: Personal Interview</ref> In 1994 Charles R. "Buster" Humphreys Jr. claimed in his book, ''Panthers of the Costal Plain'' to have recorded over 500 sightings of Cougars. Half of these were coal black panthers. This species has never been officially recorded in the State of North Carolina.<ref>http://farshores.org/abc_us04.htm</ref>.

Due to [[urbanization]] in the [[urban-wildland interface]], Cougar ranges increasingly overlap with human habitation, especially in areas with a large population of deer, its natural prey. In these cases, the Cougar may occasionally prey on livestock and on [[pet]]s, such as dogs and cats. Cougar attacks on humans have increased since the late 1980s when Cougar hunting was effectively banned in many states and the Cougar populations began to climb dramatically. Even so, Cougar attacks are still rare.

There are an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 Cougars in [[California]] (est. circa 1990) and an estimated 4,500 to 5,000 in [[Colorado]].

==Behavior==
The Cougar can kill and drag prey about 7 times its own weight. It normally hunts large mammals, such as deer, but will eat small animals, such as the [[American Beaver]], the [[North American Porcupine]] or even mice, if the need arises and can even kill a Moose. Its diet consists of 50 different species. It hunts alone and ambushes its prey, often from behind. It usually kills with a bite at the base of the skull to break the neck of its target. The carcass of the kill is usually then buried or partially covered to protect it for several days, while the Cougar continues to roam and comes back for nourishment as needed. The Cougar does not enjoy being a scavenger, however, and will generally hunt for its own food and not eat from a carcass, even if one is available. The Cougar will catch and kill its prey 82% of the time, and are consequently finicky eaters. Like other cats, it will also move to certain areas for feeding. Adult males tend to claim a 100 square mile (250&nbsp;km²) stretch for their territory; adult females take 20 to 60 square miles (50 to 150&nbsp;km²) on average; however their ranges can vary from as much as 370 square miles (1000&nbsp;km²) to as little as 10 square miles (25&nbsp;km²).

The Cougar, like all other cats, is territorial, although more territorial than most cats, especially animals from desert and very snowy regions. It will mostly avoid fighting and usually wards off others with urine markings, but it sometimes competes aggressively for territory, especially among males. An Adult [[American Black Bear]] may be able to kill a Cougar and steal its kill, but generally conflicts between the two predators does not occur. Despite being fearsome when it comes to territorial disputes with other Cougars or protecting its young (have been seen warding off bears), it is mostly shy and reclusive, and tends to avoid humans.

A male may breed with several females. Females usually have 3 or 4 kittens in a den in a rocky location. If a male Cougar invades the territory of another male, he may kill the kittens of resident females so that they will become receptive to mating.

===Attacks on humans===
Attacks on humans are rare, but do occur, especially as humans encroach on wildlands and impact the availability of the Cougar's traditional prey. There were around 100 Cougar attacks on humans in the USA and Canada during the period from 1890 to January 2004, with 16 fatalities; California, which has the highest population density of areas with a significant Cougar habitat, has had 64 attacks and 16 fatalities, most of which happened in the past 10 years. Attacks by Cougars on humans and pets are associated with urban areas situated in the [[wildland urban intermix]] such as the [[Boulder, Colorado]] area, which have encouraged a traditional prey of the Cougar, the [[Mule Deer]], to [[habituation|habituate]] to urban areas and the presence of people and pets. Cougars in such circumstances may come to lose their fear of both people and dogs and come to see them as prey.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Beast in the Garden | id = ISBN 0393058077}}</ref>

By comparison, about 40 people die in the US each year of bee stings; humans are far more likely to get struck by [[lightning]] or die from a [[black widow spider]] bite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://homepages.dordt.edu/~mahaffy/mtlion/mtlionshort_human_cougar_risk.html}}</ref> "Given the opportunities available," notes wildlife biologist Kevin Hansen, "attacks on people are surprisingly rare events indeed, suggesting an overwhelming willingness on the part of the cougar to live and let live, at least where humans are concerned."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.watchtower.org/library/g/1998/4/22/article_01.htm | title = The Puma Everywhere and Nowhere}}</ref>

On [[January 8]], [[2004]] a puma killed and partly ate a [[mountain biking|mountain biker]] in [[Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park]] in [[Orange County, California]]; what is assumed to be the same animal attacked another [[mountain biking|mountain biker]] in the park the same day, but was fought off by other [[mountain biking|bikers]]. A young male puma was shot nearby by rangers later in the day.

From September 2004 to January [[2005]], there were several reported Cougar attacks in the [[Adirondack Mountain]] towns of [[upstate New York]]. The attacks were most prevalent in [[Hampton, New York]]. Although no humans were actually attacked, the animal did kill several dogs and some exotic birds in a zoo. The government denied the existence of a Cougar in the Adirondacks, and some cryptozoologists suggested that the animal was a [[Mesonychid]], although no eyewitness reports described the animal as resembling a dog.

The Cougar cannot be hunted in California except under very specific circumstances. This, as well as the extermination in California of the [[Gray Wolf]] and [[Brown Bear]], has allowed the Cougar to increase its numbers.  California law requires that wild animals who have attacked a human must be killed if they can be located.

====Puma safety tips<ref>Kobalenko, Jerry. ''Forest Cats of North America''. Buffalo, New York 14205: Firefly Books (U.S.) Inc, 1997. ISBN 1-55209-174-4</ref>====
*Do not hike alone, go in groups with adults supervising children. When hiking, appropriate clothing for rough terrain will aid in movement and evasion.
*If confronted by a puma, do not run; that might stimulate its instinct to chase, and they can quickly outrun any person. Instead, you must convince the puma that you are a threat instead of a prey. Maintain intense eye contact, and shout as loudly as you can. Raise your arms and appear as large and menacing as possible. 
*Don't "play dead." Pumas are likely to eat a human who plays dead.  This behavior is similar to that of [[American Black Bear#Encountering a Black bear in the wild|Black bears]], but unlike [[Grizzly bear#In case of bear attack|Grizzly bears]].
*Pick up young children without bending or turning from the puma (if possible). (Comment: When under an attack by a dog, experts recommend ''NOT''' picking up a child; because that act may be interpreted as you attacking, which would encourage the dog(s) to join in the supposed attack. Instead place yourself between the animal and the child.  Whether or not this applies to cougars is uncertain.)
*Do everything possible to appear larger or intimidating, including raising arms wildly, opening up jacket, and throwing stones and branches. But DO NOT CORNER THE PUMA!
*Do not crouch down or bend over; this may create the appearance of an ordinary [[quadruped]] prey rather than a typically non-prey [[biped]].
*Install motion-sensitive outdoor lighting.
*Keep pets from roaming and never feed pets outside. Be wary when leaving pets outside, particularly at dawn and dusk.
*Do not climb a tree, as pumas can climb better than humans.
*Jogging, running, and biking on wildland trails can be particularly hazardous since such runners are likely to be less attentive to the surroundings and the motion can trigger a "chase and kill" reflex in the animal. Talk to local authorities or park rangers to see if it is advisable before taking such a risk.

Culver (2000) has reported that many of these subspecies are genetically similar.  This study suggests that the original North American subspecies of ''Puma concolor'' became extinct during the Pleistocene extinctions some 10,000 years ago and that North America was then repopulated by South American pumas, leading to the genetic similarity of modern North American cougars.  The subspecies suggested by Dr. Culver are the following:

*[[Argentine Puma]] (''Puma concolor cabrerae'')
*[[Costa Rican Cougar]] (''Puma concolor costaricensis'')
*[[Eastern South American Cougar]] (''Puma concolor capricornensis''): includes the previous subspecies ''discolor'' and ''acrocodia''
*[[North American Cougar]] (''Puma concolor cougar''): includes the previous subspecies ''[[florida panther|coryi]], [[wisconsin cougar|shorgeri]], [[eastern cougar|cougar]], azteca, improcera, missoulensis, hippolestes, oregonensis, vancouverensis, californica, kaibabensis, browni, stanleyana'', and ''mayensis''
*[[Northern South American Cougar]] (''Puma concolor concolor''): includes the previous subspecies ''concolor, bangsi, soderstromi, incarum'', and ''osgoodi''
*[[Southern South American Puma]] (''Puma concolor puma''): includes the previous subspecies ''patagonica, puma, pearsoni'', and ''araucanus''

However, other criteria in addition to molecular genetic similarity are considered in deciding subspecies status, and no consensus has been reached about reorganization of species taxonomy.
