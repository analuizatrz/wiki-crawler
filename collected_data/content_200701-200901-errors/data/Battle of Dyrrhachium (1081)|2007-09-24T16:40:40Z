The '''Battle of Dyrrhachium''' (also known as '''Siege of Durazzo''') took place on [[October 18]], [[1081]] between the [[Byzantine Empire]], led by [[Alexius I Comnenus|Alexius I]], and the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]], the [[Duke of Apulia & Calabria]].

==Background==

The [[Normans]] first arrived in Southern Italy in [[1015]] from northern [[France]] and began serving the local [[Lombard]] [[lords]] as [[mercenaries]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Instead of being paid with money the Normans were being paid with land so they were powerful enough to challenge and defeat the [[Pope]] at the [[Battle of Civitate]].<ref name="Norwich13">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 13</ref>

The Normans in Southern Italy found their leadership with the [[Hauteville]] family and soon they had occupied most of Southern Italy.<ref name="Norwich13">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 13</ref> In [[1059]], [[Robert Guiscard]] of the Hauteville family was made by the Pope Duke of [[Apulia]], [[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]]. However, most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands and Sicily was in [[Saracen]] hands.<ref name="Norwich14">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 14</ref>

By [[1071]], Robert together with his brother [[Roger I|Roger]] had taken over the last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, [[Bari]] and had by the next year conquered all of Sicily from the Saracens.<ref name="Norwich14">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 14</ref> In [[1073]], the Byzantine Emperor, [[Michael VII]] sent an envoy to Robert ofering the hand of his son [[Constantine]] to Robert's daughter [[Helena]].<ref name="Norwich14">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 14</ref><ref name="Anna Comnena1.12">Anna Comnena, ''The Alexiad'', 1.12</ref>

Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to [[Constantinople]] but in [[1078]], Michael was overthrown and was succeeded on the throne by [[Nicephorus Botaneiates]] which destoryed any chances the Helena had for the throne.<ref name="Anna Comnena1.12">Anna Comnena, ''The Alexiad'', 1.12</ref> This gave Robert an excuse to intervene by claiming his daughter had been mistreated but was delayed by a revolt in Italy.<ref name="Norwich15">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 15</ref>

Robert began mustering his army by conscripting any man of servable age and forcing them in the army as well as refitting the army.<ref name="Norwich16">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 16</ref> During this period, a pretender claiming he was Michael VII arrived in Italy claiming he had escaped the monastery. Meanwhile, Robert sent an ambassador to the Byzantine court, with the instructions to demand proper treatment for Helena as well as winning over the [[Domestic of the Schools]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]].<ref name="Anna Comnena1.15">Anna Comnena, ''The Alexiad'', 1.15</ref> It is unknown how the ambassador fared with the first two but he fell under Alexios' charm and as he was returning to Italy he heard of Alexios successful coup.<ref name="Norwich16">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 16</ref>

When the ambassador returned to Robert, he urged him to make peace with Alexios claiming that Alexios wanted nothing but friendship with the Normans as well as claiming that the Michael at Robert's court was a pretender having seen the real Michael with his own eyes.<ref name="Anna Comnena1.15">Anna Comnena, ''The Alexiad'', 1.15</ref> Robert had no intentions for peace and he sent his son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemend]] with an advance force towards Greece while he followed shortly after.<ref name="Norwich17">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 17</ref>

==Prelude==

[[Image:Alexius I.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A manuscript depicting Alexios.]]

The fleet set off towards the Byzantine Empire the end of May in [[1081]]. The fleet consisted of 150 ships and the army was numbered 30,000 men as well as 1,300 Norman knights.<ref name="Norwich17">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 17</ref><ref name="Asimov216">Asimov, ''Constantinople: The Forgotten Empire'', 216</ref><ref name="Anna Comnena1.17">Anna Comnena, ''The Alexiad'', 1.17</ref> The fleet sailed to [[Valona|Avalona]] which was Byzantine territory and there they were joined by several ships form [[Ragusa]], a people in the [[Balkans]] who hated the Byzantines.<ref name="Norwich17">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 17</ref>

He soon left Avalona and he sailed to the island of [[Corfu]] which surrendered to him and having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements to arrive from Italy, he advanced on the city of [[Durres|Dyrrhachium]] which was the chief port and capitol of [[Illyria]]. As Robert's fleet was sailing to Dyrrhachium it was hit by a storm and several ships were lost.<ref name="Norwich17">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 17</ref>

Meanwhile, when Alexios heard that the Normans were preparing to invade Byzantine territory, he sent an ambassador to the [[Doge]] of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Domenico Selvo]] requesting aid against the Normans offering them trading rights in return for their help.<ref name="Norwich17">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 17</ref><ref name="Asimov216">Asimov, ''Constantinople: The Forgotten Empire'', 216</ref> The Doge who was alarmed by the Norman control of the Straits of Otranto took command of the fleet and sailed at once, suprising the Norman fleet under the command of Bohemond as night was falling. Overcoming the suprise, the Normans counter-attacked tenaciously but their inexperience in naval combat betrayed them and after the Venetian use of [[Greek fire]], the Norman line scattered and the Venetian sailed in Dyrrhacium's harbour.<ref name="Norwich18">Norwich, ''Byzantium: Decline and Fall'', 18</ref>

==Siege of Dyrrhachium==

Robert however was not discouraged by this naval defeat and began his siege of Dyrrhachium. In command of the garrison at Dyrrhachium was the proven general, George Palaiologos who had been send there by Alexios with orders to hold out at costs while Alexios himself mustered an army to come and relief the city.<ref name="Norwich18">Norwich, ''Byzantium:Decline and Fall'', 18</ref> 

Meanwhile, a Byzantine fleet arrived and after joining with the Venetian fleet, they attacked the Norman fleet which was again routed. The garrison at Dyrrhachium managed to hold out all summer despite facing Robert' catapults, balistae and siege tower. The garrison continued to make sallies from the city and one occasion Palaiologos fought all day with an arrowhead in his skull and an other sally suceeded in destroying Robert's siege tower.<ref name="Norwich18">Norwich, ''Byzantium:Decline and Fall'', 18</ref>

In Robert's camp disease struck with [[Anna Comnena]] claiming that up to 10,000 men died including 500 knights. Alexios, meanwhile was in [[Thessalonica]] with his army and when he heard that the situation in Dyrrhachium was getting desparate, he advanced in full force against the Normans. According to Anna Comena, Alexius had somewhat less than that, perhaps about 20 000 - the [[Thrace|Thracian]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] ''[[tagma]]ta'', the elite ''excubita'' and ''vestiaritae'' units, a force of so-called Manichaeans ([[Bogomil]] heretics organized into military units), [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[cavalry]], [[Seljuk Turks|Turkish]] and Frankish [[mercenary|mercenaries]], Balkan [[conscription|conscripts]], [[Armenia]]n [[infantry]], some of the [[Varangian]]s, and other light troops.

==Aftermath==

[[Image:Robert_Guiscard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Numismatics|Coin]] of Robert Guiscard.]]

This was a serious defeat for Alexius. The former Byzantine heartland in [[Anatolia]] had recently been overrun after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in [[1071]], and now the Balkans were on the verge of being lost as well. Guiscard captured Dyrrhachium and over the next few months took most of northern [[Greece]] as well. Alexius negotiated with [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] to attack Norman allies in [[Italy]], but while Guiscard returned home to deal with this, Bohemond defeated Alexius twice more. It was not until [[1083]] that Alexius forced the Normans out of the Balkans.

The initial successful intervention of the Venetian fleet pushed Alexios to issue the famous ''Golden Bull'', by which Venice trades obtained full tax exemption in the whole Empire, as well as an entire district in Constantinople. This act was the base of the extraordinary economical expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean in the following centuries.
