The '''Kitchen Building''' was constructed in 1916 as an office building on the corner of 15th Street and Winchester Avenue <ref name="PRESERVE_1978"/>. The Second National Bank (then known as the Ashland Day and Night Bank, which was renamed in 1922) occupied the first floor beginning in 1915 with other offices occupying the other levels.

In 1923, the '''Ashland Bank Building''' was constructed at the corner of Winchester Avenue and 16th Street  <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_1954"/>. The 11-story, 116 ft. (35 m.) tall building was one of the city's tallest structures.

Constructed in 1926, the '''Camayo Arcade''' was considered the "finest in the south" by the Paintsville Hearald <ref name="PRESERVE_1978">Chappell, Edward A. "A historic preservation plan for Ashland, Kentucky." City of Ashland, Apr. 1978. 2 Jan. 2006.</ref>. It is a four-story structure between Winchester Avenue and the alley, and two-stories between the alley and Carter Avenue. The arcade functioned with numerous shops on the first and second levels, and offices on the upper floors. The façade features a three-bay classical arch design and included bronze marquees at each entrance.

Completed on May 14, 1928 <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_1954"/>, the 11-story brick '''Henry Clay Hotel''' features classical and renaissance details <ref name="PRESERVE_1978"/>.

In 1930, a five-story <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_1954">"A history of Ashland, Kentucky, 1786-1954." Ashland Centennial Committee. 1954. 2 Jan., 2007.</ref> structure replaced the existing Kitchen Building, featuring a Beux-Arts inspired classical façade. Two years later, the bank moved to the former Ashland Bank Building <ref name="PRESERVE_1978"/>; the building became home of the Stecklers Department Store.

In 1949, Sears purchased the former Field Furniture Building and operated a major department store until 1991 <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_2004"/>.

In 1970, the Camayo Arcade was purchased by the Mayo family and was renamed the Second National Arcade <ref name="PRESERVE_1978"/>. It has since been renamed back to the Camayo Arcade.

Designed by the Touche, Dinkeloo and Associates, the '''Kentucky Power Company''' building was completed in 1976-77 <ref name="PRESERVE_1978"/>. The five-story glass structure, featuring stainless steel accents, includes an underground parking structure and drive-through lanes. It was later used by [[American Electric Power]] and is now host to numerous offices and a restaurant.

The '''Carl. D. Perkins Federal Building''' is a 62,000 sq. ft. federal building. Ground breaking took place on August 19, 1983 <ref name="CITYDIR_1985">"Ashland City Directory." 1985.</ref>. The new $8.3 million structure, at the corner of 15th Street and Greenup Avenue, was completed in 1985.

On March 8, 1984, ground breaking took place for a new $8.3 million '''Quality Royale Hotel''' at the corner of Winchester Avenue and 15th Street <ref name="CITYDIR_1985"/>. Envisioned originally in 1980 as a hotel, retail and visitors center at 6th Street where the Ashland Town Center resides today, developers instead chose a downtown location. The ten-story, 160-room structure was completed in September 1985 and was renamed [[Clarion Hotels|Quality Inn]] upon opening. The hotel features 112,500 sq. ft. of conference space, a 180-seat restaurant, 100-seat lounge, three ballrooms/dining rooms, two seminar rooms, an indoor pool and sauna and a two-story atrium. It is now known as the '''Ashland Plaza Hotel'''.

Today, the Henry Clay Hotel is the '''Henry Clay House''' featuring 52 apartments <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_2004"/>. The former Sears Building and the Kitchen Building are under the same consideration.

== Melody Mountain and Providence Hill ==
On March 20, 2003, it was announced that Melody Mountain would be developed <ref name="DI_033103">Fields, Ben. "Gilmore: Ashland mall has potential tenants waiting." Daily Independent [Ashland] 31 March, 2003. 31 Dec. 2006 [http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=5417].</ref>. Overlooking the city to the west, it is bounded by 6th Street, [[U.S. Route 23|US 23]], and a [[CSX]] spur. Initial plans were to include a [[Wal-Mart]], [[Home Depot]], [[O'Charley's]], [[Fire Mountain]] and [[Outback Steakhouse]], although Fire Mountain and Home Depot later dropped out of the project <ref>Fields, Ben. "Chick-fil-A set to open in September." Daily Independent [Ashland] 29 May, 2006. 31 Dec. 2006 [http://www.dailyindependent.com/siteSearch/apstorysection/local_story_149205104.html].</ref>. The $30 million Melody Mountain project was destined to be completed in 2005 <ref name="DI_033103"/>, however, it opened in early 2006.

Adjacent to Melody Mountain across US 23 is the 55-acre Providence Hill development project. It was first announced on December 21, 2004 <ref name="DI_122204">Crace, Beth. "New retail, residential development unveiled." Daily Independent [Ashland] 22 Dec., 2004. 31 Dec. 2006 [http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=25603].</ref> after the land was purchased several days prior for $700,000. On December 15, 2005, ground was broken for the $30 million housing and retail project <ref>Kirschner, Carrie. "Ground for Phase one of Providence Hill broken." Daily Independent [Ashland] 15 Dec., 2005. 31 Dec. 2006 [http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=52199].</ref>. Phase one will include nine three-story apartment buildings for a total of 216 units; upon completion, an eight-story condominium complex will be constructed overlooking downtown Ashland and the [[Ohio River]]. The final phase includes the completion of an upscale retail and office complex <ref>Kirschner, Carrie. "Man arrested for theft of construction materials." Daily Independent [Ashland] 20 Nov., 2006. 31 Dec. 2006 [http://www.dailyindependent.com/siteSearch/apstorysection/local_story_324231726.html].</ref>.

Providence Hill is expected to be complete in late-2007 <ref name="DI_122204"/>.

== Streetscape Improvements ==
[[Image:Ashland Kentucky Streetscape.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A renovated streetscape, looking east along Winchester Avenue.]]
On November 11, 2004, Ashland's [[Main Street]] program revealed plans for a streetscape project in the central business district <ref name="DI_111204">Crace, Beth. "Main Street lays out downtown revitalization plan." Daily Independent [Ashland] 12 Nov. 2004. 31 Dec. 2006 [http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=23010].</ref>. Billed as an economic development that would spur further revitalization of the downtown, the Kentucky's Main Street's initiative is to utilize state funds to restore business districts. The main focus in the plan is on Winchester Avenue which includes,
* Narrowing Winchester Avenue between 13th Street and 18th Street to two-lanes,
* Constructing new sidewalks and removing basements under city right-of-way,
* Burying utilities,
* Installing new traffic-signal mast-arms,
* Installing new period street lights,
* Retrofitting existing street lights with period street lamps,
* Planting new trees and vegetation in "pocket parks."

Tinted concrete was to be used at crosswalks, but this was changed to brick due to concerns about future maintenance concerns <ref name="DI_050305">Moses, Emily B. "Work begins on Streetscape plan." Daily Independent [Ashland] 3 May, 2005. 30 Dec. 2006 [http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=36788].</ref>.

The city received $850,000 in state grants in 2004 to jumpstart construction on a segment from 13th to 14th Streets along Winchester Avenue <ref name="DI_111204"/>. In 2005, construction extended to 15th Street. An additional $3 million from state and federal grants is required for completion to 18th Street; completion is scheduled for 2008.

Along with the streetscape project, a Judd Plaza renovation is also being planned <ref name="DI_102504">Crace, Beth. "Mayor advocates Judd Plaza upgrades." Daily Independent [Ashland] 25 Oct. 2004. 31 Dec. 2006 [http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=21795].</ref>. More green space, recreational and seating areas, and a stage are envisioned for the brick-lined plaza at the corner of 16th Street and Winchester Avenue. It would be home to concerts, speeches and plays and would tie into the [[Country Music Highway]] which runs through the city. In the immediate future, a clock at the plaza may be installed that would honor the city's recent sesquicentennial celebration.
