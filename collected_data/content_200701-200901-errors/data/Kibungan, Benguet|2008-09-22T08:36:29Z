==Geography==

===Topography===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kibungan Benguet.jpg|left|thumb|480px|Mountains of Kibungan, Benguet]] -->
Kibungan is well known in the province of Benguet as the town with unique grand mountains often mistaken to resemble those of the Switzerland mountains. Deep ravines and cliffs separate and isolate many sitios of some barangays. Although some plateaus, hills and small valleys can be seen in the locality, Kibungan is dominantly mountainous.

The municipality is within a cool highland mountainous zone with elevations at more than 2500 meters above sea level.During its coolest months of December - January, Barangay Madaymen experiences chilling temperature of 0 degrees Celsius causing the famous ''Frost of Madaymen''.

==Points of Interest and Tourism==
;Les-eng Rice Terraces: These magnificent terraces can be reached after 6-hour hike through lush pine forests in Barangay Tacadang.

;Mayos River: Located at the northeastern part of Barangay Poblacion. It is approximately 2.5 kilometers in length and is about 3 kilometers awayfrom Poblacion Proper. The river originates from ridges of nearby Barangays Madaymen, Palina and Tacadang and supplies water to rice paddies and vegetable farms along the vicinity.

;Palina Rice Terraces:In Barangay Palina at the foot of Mt. Kilkili believed to be a former volcano because of its conical shape. Constructed following a century-old system of rice terraces built with stone walls and neatly arranged one after the other. The rice terraces are at their best in December and June when the rice paddies turn golden yellow, near harvest time. The Palina rice terraces is known as the municipality’s rice granary.

:A road network links the area to the town proper and other barangays but public transport vehicles are limited.

In order to promote the uniqueness of the municipality's [[ecotourism]], the people want the tag "[[Switzerland]] of [[Benguet]]" removed as of 2007. The tag was created in good faith as the municipality is a mountainous region and has a cool climate that is associated with Switzerland. However, this gives the wrong impression that the municipality has snow-covered peaks for skiing.<ref>{{cite news |first=Delmar  |last=Cariño |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Benguet town drops Switzerland brand  |url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/features/view_article.php?article_id=98807 |format= |work= |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=2007-11-04 |accessdate=2007-11-08 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> Through a tagline contest, the municipality was able to select a more appropriate tagline however, this shall be released after refinement and adoption by the Sangguniang Bayan. 

==Indigenous rice varieties==
500 [[hectares]] are devoted to rice production (in Barangays or [[villages]] Palina, Poblacion and Tacadang). Kibugan is known for its 16 [[indigenous]] [[rice]] varieties which are still being cultivated in 2 distinct seasons, the Kintoman (dry) and the Pulaglag (wet).

===Red, white rice varieties===
Kintoman rice includes red rice varieties gal-ong, lasbakan, lablabi, kabal, dikalot, makabsog, langpadan and balatinao, while white rice varieties include sabsaba, lamadya, ngilaan and kalipago (also kintoman rice). Pulaglag red rice include talabtab and diket. Makanining and balisanga are white pulaglag rice. Laley, lamadya, ngila-an, bongkitan and balatinao are also planted during the rainy season. Balatinao, “black" rice is  used in [[wine-making]]. [[Glutinous rice]] varieties of diket, bongkitan and balatinao are also planted. All of these varieties require 6 months to harvest. The Tacadang Les-eng rice terraces and the Palina rice terraces at the foot of Mt. Kilkili both become golden yellow upon rice harvest in June and December. Tacadang, Palina, and Poblacion rice terraces at the foot of the rocky walls rise to 2,500 meters above sea level.
Kibungan rice is sold at P 120 ($2.74 - $ 1:P 43.75) per salop (2.5 [[kilos]]).
90% of the land area is agricultural, of total land area of 20,000 hectares.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/98763/Kibungan-folk-still-plant-indigenous-rice-varieties gmanews.tv,  Kibungan folk still plant indigenous rice varieties]</ref>
