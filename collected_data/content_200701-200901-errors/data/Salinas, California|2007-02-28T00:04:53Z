'''Salinas''' is the [[county seat]] and largest municipality of [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The most current estimate from the California Department of Finance, places the 2006 population at 148,350,<ref name="California Department of Finance, 2006 population estimate">{{cite web|url=http://www.dof.ca.gov/HTML/DEMOGRAP/ReportsPapers/Estimates/E1/documents/E-1table.xls|title=California Department of Finance, 2006 population estimate|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> showing a slight decrease since 2000 which is largely attributed to the city's high cost of living. The largely suburban city is located at the mouth of the [[Salinas Valley]] roughly eight miles from the Pacific ocean and enjoys a mild climate. Salinas is known for being an agricultural center as well as being the hometown of famed writer and Nobel prize laureate [[John Steinbeck]].

== Brief history ==
Salinas' economy is largely based upon [[agriculture]]. Located in one of California's richest farming regions, the area produces a variety of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, including [[lettuce]], [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[watermelon]]s, [[broccoli]], [[carrot]]s, [[cabbage]]s, and [[spinach]].Therefore many major vegetable producers are headquartered in Salinas.

Salinas was also the birthplace of  writer and Nobel prize laureate John Steinbeck. The recently revitalized historic downtown is home to the National Steinbeck Center and the [[John Steinbeck Library]]. The city is currently meeting with local developers to once again attempt to build a high-rise hotel and condominum complex. As of now, no definite decision has been made but development of one of the proposals is likely to proceed in the coming months.

== Geography ==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 49.2 [[km²]] (19.0 [[square mile|mi²]]), all land.

The city lies approximately 18 [[meters]] (59 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]) above sea level and is located roughly eight miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast, at the mouth of the Salinas Valley.  The Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges border the city to the east and south, respectively.  Both mountain ranges and the Salinas Valley run approximately 90 miles south-east from Salinas towards [[King City, California|King City]].

== Conveyor belt weather ==
[[Image:Las Palmas Snow.jpg|thumb|left|250px|On 10 March 2006, a record breaking storm covered many of the nearby mountain tops in a white blanket of snow.]]
Salinas enjoys cool and moderate temperatures due to the "natural [[air conditioner]]" that conveys ocean air and fog in from the [[Monterey Bay]] to Salinas while towns to the north and south of Salinas experience hotter summers as mountains block the ocean air.  Thus Salinas weather is closer to that of the [[Central Coast of California]] rather than that of inland valleys and thus enjoys a mild [[Mediterranean climate]] with typical daily highs ranging from the low 50s (°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) in the winter to the low 70s (°F) in the summer.  The difference between ocean and air temperature also tends to create heavy morning fog during the summer months (known as the [[marine layer]]) driven by an [[onshore wind]] created by the local high pressure sunny portions of the Salinas Valley which extend north and south from Salinas and the Bay.

The average annual rainfall for the city is approximately 242.3 [[millimeter|mm]] (9.5 [[inch|in]]). On rare occasions there is snowfall on the peaks of the [[Gabilan Mountains|Gabilan]] and [[Santa Lucia Mountains|Santa Lucia]] mountain ranges, which border, respectively, the east and west sides of the Salinas Valley.

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 151,060 people, 38,298 households, and 30,025 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] was 3,068.1/km² (7,948.4/mi²).  There were 39,659 housing units at an average density of 805.5/km² (2,086.8/mi²).  The racial makeup of the city was 64.10% [[Hispanic]], 45.16% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 5.90% [[Asian American]], 3.27% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 1.26% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] out of which 49.2% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.6% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.6% were non-families. 17.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 3.66 and the average family size was 4.07.

In the city the population was spread out with 32.0% under the age of 19 or younger, 11.8% from 18 to 24, 33.7% from 25 to 44, 15.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.1% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females there were 113.7 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 117.4 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $43,728, and the median income for a family was $44,669. Males had a median income of $35,641 versus $27,013 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $14,495.  About 12.8% of families and 16.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 20.1% of those under age 18 and 9.4% of those age 65 or over.

Median household income in the city tended to be significantly higher alonside the city limits, especially in the northern Harden Ranch and Creekbridge neighborhoods. East Salinas and the downtown area suffered from a very low median households income as well as high crime rates. South and North Salinas featured roughly the same level of median households income with the latter being home to city's wealthiest newly constructed neighborhoods.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Income Map">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ThematicMapFramesetServlet?_bm=y&-tree_id=403&-_MapEvent=zoom&-errMsg=&-_useSS=N&-_dBy=150&-redoLog=false&-_zoomLevel=4&-tm_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_M00024&-tm_config=|b=50|l=en|t=403|zf=0.0|ms=thm_def|dw=0.3778881864165808|dh=0.22403586680110513|dt=gov.census.aff.domain.map.EnglishMapExtent|if=gif|cx=-121.6414055|cy=36.6865445|zl=5|pz=5|bo=|bl=|ft=350:349:335:389:388:332:331|fl=403:381:204:380:369:379:368|g=16000US0664224|ds=DEC_2000_SF3_U|sb=50|tud=false|db=150|mn=0|mx=83123|cc=1|cm=1|cn=7|cb=|um=Dollars|pr=0|th=DEC_2000_SF3_U_M00024|sf=N|sg=&-PANEL_ID=tm_result&-_pageY=&-_lang=en&-geo_id=16000US0664224&-_pageX=&-_mapY=&-_mapX=&-_latitude=&-_pan=&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_longitude=&-_changeMap=Identify|title=US Census Bureau, Income Map|accessdate=2006-11-2}}</ref>

== Airport ==
[[Salinas Municipal Airport]] is located on the southeastern boundary of the City of Salinas, three miles from city center. It is a general aviation facility occupying 763 acres, with three runways serving single and twin engine aircraft and helicopters, as well as an increasing number of turbopropeller and turbine-powered business jets.
The airport has an air traffic control tower in operation twelve hours/day, 7 days/week. The Airport Terminal is located on Mortensen Avenue and houses Airport Office staff as well as professional offices. The City is currently accepting proposals for leasing and operation of the restaurant located within the Terminal. Salinas Airport Commissioners gave the nod to a proposed project that would bring a 100-room hotel, offices and hangars to a vacant lot in front of the Salinas Municipal Airport terminal. The Salinas Jet Center would include a national chain hotel, 80,000 square feet of office space, four large complexes combining more offices with airplane hangars and a 24-hour, full-service plane-fueling station.  The project would also include a taxiway to allow planes to come and go from the new hangars.

The airport has full [[Instrument Landing System]] (ILS) and [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) located on the airport. The ILS has a Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System, with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights. The VOR approach has Runway End Identifier Lights. All but the ILS runway, RWY 31, have Visual Approach Slope Indicators (VASIs).

===Airport Operational Statistics===
Aircraft based on the field: 224; Single engine airplanes: 160; Multi engine airplanes: 49; Jet airplanes: 1; Helicopters: 14; Aircraft operations: avg 237/day; Transient general aviation 57%; Local general aviation 40%; Air taxi 5%; Military less than 1%

===California International Airshow===
Salinas Airport is the location of the annual California International Airshow,  The [[airshow]] often features top-tier [[aerobatic]] teams such as the [[Snowbirds|Canadian Forces Snowbirds]], [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds]] and the [[Blue Angels|U.S. Navy Blue Angels]], with the proceeds going to local charities.

== Rail Transportation ==
[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, serves Salinas, operating its [[Coast Starlight]] daily in each direction between [[Seattle, Washington]] and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles]].

== Economy ==
[[Image:$700,000 Home.jpg|thumb|An average 1,800 sq ft home in the city's desirable north-western district valued at roughly $700k]]
Salinas is known as the ''Salad Bowl of America'' or ''Salad Bowl of the World''.  Over 80% of the lettuce grown in the United States is grown in the Salinas Valley. According to the 2000 US Census, 24% of the population worked in sales and office occupations, 21.4% worked in management, professional, and related occupations, 16.2% worked in service occupations, 14.9% worked in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, 14.4% worked in production, transportation, and material moving occupations, and 9.1% worked in construction, extraction, and maintenance occupations.

The large discrepency between household income levels and the median home price is largely due to the recent surge in house prices, that affected coastal California in an espcially strong manner.

== City funding ==
[[Image:HR003.JPG|thumb|250px|Ranch style home in North Salinas]]
During the first half of this decade, the Salinas city government struggled to deal with funding shortages.  A downturn in the state economy, combined with an unusually low per-capita tax base, forced the city to curtail certain services. During the crisis, Salinas almost became the first city in the [[United States]] to close its libraries. However, an outpouring of private donations provided an ample stop-gap measure, keeping the libraries open with reduced hours. Donations were raised through [[Rally Salinas!]], a grassroots fundraising organization launched by the city's mayor, to keep the libraries open through 2005. 

In November 2005, voters approved a tax measure to fund several vital services in the city, including libraries, by a 61 percent vote. The measure, known locally as  Measure V, will provide some $11 million in funding to take affect in the 2007 fiscal year. The measure will allow the city to start restoring more than $15 million in service cuts including the closure of three recreation centers and the elimination of graffiti abatement and crossing guard money for schools. An independent oversight committee was appointed by the City Council to oversee the money raised by the tax increase, which will be in place for the next 10 years. In April 2006, the committee recommended dedicating 70% of revenues to restoring [[library]] and police services.

In 2006, the city's financial situation was considerably improved, as Salinas officials announced a budget surplus.

==Crime==
[[Image:Salinas Crime.jpg|thumb|400px|The homicide rate since 1985 for Salinas, Sacramento and the US total.]]
One of the city's most serious problems is [[Crime in the United States|violent crime]]. While the city's current violent crime rate is above the national average, historic trends suggest improvement. The number of [[aggravated assault]]s fell from 844 in 1993 to 661 in 1998. In 2004, there were 11.4 murders per 100,000 residents, more than twice the national average of 5.5. In 2005, however, the city's homicide rate decreased dramatically to a record low of 4.96 homicides per 100,000 persons, approximately 15% below national average where it remained for 2006.<ref name="FBI uniformed crime report statistics, Salinas, 2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_08_ca.html|title=FBI uniformed crime report statistics, Salinas, 2005|accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref> Overall the rate of homicides per 100,000 persons is currently at its lowest level since the late 1980s, having returned from its record high levels in mid and late 1990s.<ref name="US Bureau of Justice Statistics, Violent Crime in Salinas since 1985">{{Cite web|url=http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Crime/Local/RunCrimeJurisbyJuris.cfm|title=US Bureau of Justice Statistics, Violent Crime in Salinas since 1985|accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref><ref name="US Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Vioent Crime Rates">{{cite web|url=http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Crime/State/RunCrimeStatebyState.cfm|title=US Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Vioent Crime Rates|accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref>

===Gangs===
[[Gangs|Gang activity]] is responsible for a substantial portion of the violent crime in Salinas. The majority of street gang territory in Salinas comes under the [[Norteño]] and [[Sureño]] gangs, located mostly in the  Eastside, however there are cliques elsewhere within the city.
In 1998, local police estimated that 17% of all violent crimes -- and 71% of the city's homicides -- were gang related. Partners for Peace, a local gang prevention and youth welfare group, cites the low educational attainment, low household income (considering the median house price), and high population density caused by a lack of affordable housing as aggravating factors. The [[Monterey County, California|County of Monterey]] launched a task force early this year in an effort to fight the problem of gangs. The Monterey County Joint Gang Task Force is composed of personnel from the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, Probation Department, District Attorney's Office and the Salinas Police Department.  The Sheriff's Office and the Salinas Police Department have ordered seven cars that will allow task force members to use their own equipment. The cars will feature radio and computer systems that can communicate across both Sheriff's Office and police frequencies. To increase their visibility to gang members, the cars are painted black with the words "Gang Task Force" written in silver across the sides, making them distinct from the black-and-white cars used by regular patrol officers.

== Media ==
The Monterey/Salinas metro area is served by a limited variety of local television stations, and is the 125th largest designated market area (DMA) in the U.S. with 218,080 homes (0.198% of the U.S.). Those stations are:

Channel 8: [[KSBW]] - ([[NBC]]) - Salinas

Channel 15/22: [[K15CU/]][[KMUV]] - ([[Telemundo]]) - Monterey/Salinas/Santa Cruz (Simulcast of [[KSTS]] 48).

Channel 25: [[KCAH]] - ([[PBS]]) - Watsonville (Simulcast of San Jose's [[KTEH]])

Channel 33: [[KDJT]] - ([[Telefutura]]) - Monterey 

Channel 35: [[KCBA]] - ([[Fox]]) - Salinas

Channel 43: [[KMCE]] - ([[Azteca America]]) - Monterey/Salinas

Channel 46: [[KION]] - ([[CBS]]) - Monterey

Channel 67: [[KSMS]] - ([[Univision]]) - Monterey

The Monterey/Salinas area has been lacking an ABC ([[American Broadcasting Company]]) affiliate since 2000, when [[KNTV]] was purchased, and subsequently became the NBC station for the San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose metropolitan area. KNTV, now known as [[NBC11]], later moved its transmission tower from Loma Prieta Peak (located between San Jose and Santa Cruz) to San Bruno Mountain, north of San Francisco International Airport, therefore ceasing its signal coverage in Monterey and Salinas.  A microwave relay feed of [[KGO-TV|KGO-7]], the ABC affiliate out of San Francisco, is available through the local cable provider ([[Comcast]]).
