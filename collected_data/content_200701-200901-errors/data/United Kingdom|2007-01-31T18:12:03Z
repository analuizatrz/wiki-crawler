It occupies the majority of the [[British Isles]] and its territory and population are primarily situated on the island of [[Great Britain]] and in [[Northern Ireland]], which shares a land border with the [[Republic of Ireland]] on the island of [[Ireland]]. The United Kingdom is bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and its ancillary bodies of water, including the [[North Sea]], the [[English Channel]], the [[Celtic Sea]], and the [[Irish Sea]]. The mainland is linked to [[France]] by the [[Channel Tunnel]].

The United Kingdom is a [[political union]] made up of four [[constituent country|constituent countries]]: [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

==History==
{{main|History of the United Kingdom}}
The [[Political union|Union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]] is the latest of several unions formed over the last 300 years. The [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[Kingdom of England]] had existed as separate states with their own [[monarchs]] and political structures since the 9th century. The once independent [[Wales|Principality of Wales]] fell under the control of English monarchs from the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284, becoming itself part of the [[Kingdom of England]] by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Laws in Wales Act 1535]].<ref name = "Schools">"[http://www.schoolshistory.org.uk/walesunion.htm The Act of Union with Wales]", Schools’ History, 7 November 2004.

18th century Britain, like  other [[Great Powers]], was a significant contributor to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], with [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[science|scientific]] input and an influential [[literary]] and [[theatrical]] tradition. Over the next century the United Kingdom played a leading role in developing [[Western world|Western]] ideas of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and [[capitalism]] with significant contributions to [[literature]], the [[arts]], [[science]] and technology.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> The wealth of the early [[British Empire]], like  other [[Great Powers]], was also partly generated by colonial exploitation,  including the industrialisation after 1750 of the [[slavery|slave trade]], with Britain's 18th century shipping fleet, the largest in the world, taking African slaves to the Americas as part of the infamous [[Triangular Trade]].<ref>[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular National Maritime Museum - the transatlantic slave trade provided the venture capital for the industrial revolution]</ref> At the beginning of the nineteenth century, however, after campaigns by abolitionist politicians including [[William Wilberforce]], Britain was the first nation to permanently [[Slave Trade Act 1807|prohibit]] trade in slaves.

After the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the defeat of France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Britain became the principal world power at the beginning of the 19th century.  At its peak, the [[British Empire]] stretched to almost one-quarter of the [[Earth]]'s surface and encompassed a third of its population, making it in terms of  population and territory the largest [[empire]] in history.

During the nineteenth century the country played an important role in the development of [[parliamentary democracy]], partly via a  growing extension of [[suffrage]] through a series of significant electoral reforms, and towards the end of the century  was the first nation to develop a  [[public health]] infrastructure. Developments of [[science]] and the [[arts]], building on an 18th century inheritance of figures such as [[Isaac Newton]], and   particularly its earlier tradition of  [[literature]],  were influential.

At the end of the Victorian period, however, the United Kingdom lost its  industrial leadership, particularly to the [[United States]], which surpassed the UK in industrial production and trade in the 1890s, and to a lesser extent to the [[German Empire]]. As a result of  gains  of the late 1800s Britain  nevertheless remained the pre-eminent superpower, and its empire expanded to its maximum size by 1921, gaining the [[League of Nations]] mandate over certain former German colonies after the [[World War I|First World War]]. However, from the close of [[World War I]] the United Kingdom's dominant role in international relations had begun to decline.

After emergence from the war, the creation of the world's first large-scale and international network of  broadcasting , the [[BBC]], its first experience of government by the growing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour movement]] in expansion since the late 19th century, and  recovery from the [[Great Depression]] in the late 1930s, Britain fought [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], with its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] allies including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]],[[South Africa]] and [[India]], later to be joined by further [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Wartime leader [[Winston Churchill]] and his successor [[Clement Atlee]] helped plan the postwar world as part of the Big Three.  World War II, however, left the United Kingdom financially and physically damaged. Economically costly wartime [[loans]], loans taken in 1945 from the United States and from Canada, combined with postwar [[Marshall Plan]] aid from the United States started the United Kingdom on the road to recovery.

1945 saw the emergence of the British [[Welfare State]] and one of the world's first and most comprehensive [[National Health Service|Health Service]]s, while the demands of a recovering economy brought people from all over the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] to create a [[multiethnic]] Britain. Although the new postwar limits of Britain's [[political]] role were confirmed by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956,  the international currency  of its [[English Language|language]] meant the continuing impact of its literature and [[culture]], while at the same time its [[popular culture]] found a global influence . The 1970s saw a period of economic stagnation following global economic downturn. The rule of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1980s saw the power of unions rolled back and this, together with a substantial inflow of [[North Sea]] oil royalties, added to economic recovery which was however accompanied by higher economic inequality.

<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->

[[Image:Insight may03 focus beaton large.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]].]]

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Executive (government)|executive power]] exercised on behalf of the [[British monarchy|monarch]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] and other [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] ministers who head [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|departments]].

The cabinet, including the prime minister, and other senior [[political minister|minister]]s collectively make up [[Her Majesty's Government]]. These ministers are drawn from, and are responsible to, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] - the legislative body which is traditionally considered to be "supreme" (that is, able to legislate on any matter and not bound by decisions of its predecessors).  The British system of government has been emulated around the world — a legacy of the British Empire's [[colonialism|colonial past]], most notably in the other [[Commonwealth Realms]] ­— however, the United Kingdom, along with [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]], form one of the three countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]], relying instead on traditional [[custom (law)|customs]] and separate pieces of [[constitutional law]]<ref>"[http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System A Guide To the UK Legal System]" Carter, Sarah ([[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]]), retrieved May 16 2006</ref>.

While the monarch is [[head of state]] and technically holds all executive power, they must nominate a [[head of government]] ([[Prime Minister]]) that the Parliament agrees upon.  The Prime Minister is nowadays always a member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], the last Lord to be Prime Minister was Lord Home in the 1960s.  The Prime Minister must be someone who the Monarch believes will be able to form a government with the "confidence" of a majority of members of the Commons.  This usually means the leader of the party with the largest number of Commons seats, because the "first past the post" electoral system for the Commons usually gives the largest party an absolute majority. If there were no party with an absolute majority, then the Prime Minister would be whoever could form a coalition with the support of a Commons majority.  This would almost certainly be the leader of the largest party in the coalition, but (conceivably) not necessarily the leader of the largest party in the Commons.

[[Image:Location of the BOTs.PNG|thumb|200px|Location of the British Overseas Territories <br><small>([[British Antarctic Territory]] and [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus]] not shown)</small>]]

The Prime Minister appoints ministers to government posts, usually from senior members of their own party.  Most ministers are members of, and answerable to, the House of Commons (particularly at their Department's "Question Time").  The remaining ministers are usually from the [[House of Lords]], Ministers do not legally have to come from Parliament, but that is the modern day custom, and a Prime Minister who wants to bring someone into the government from outside Parliament will usually first create them a [[Life Peer]], i.e. give them a non-hereditary seat in the House of Lords.  The chief advantage put forward for the Parliamentary system of Government is this direct accountability of cabinet members to Parliament.  The counter-argument is that the majority of legislators (elected to hold government to account) are (because they are in the PM's party) actually looking to the Prime Minister for personal advancement — and that most politicians (at least in the early stages of their career) appear to view the being an MP not as an honourable and status-awarding end in itself but as the route to office.

The current prime minister is [[Tony Blair]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who has been in office since 1997. At the 2005 general election, the Labour Party had a majority of 66 seats. However, it is now a 64 seat majority due to a by-election loss to the Liberal Democrats in Scotland. 

[[Image:The mall london.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] looking onto [[Buckingham Palace]], The official residence of the British Monarch.]]

In the United Kingdom, the monarch has extensive theoretical powers, but his/her role is mainly, though not exclusively, ceremonial<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990723/debtext/90723-23.htm Extract] (''[[Hansard]]'', [[23 July]] [[1999]], Col.1545) ("''As the Queen's consent has not been obtained, this cannot be dealt with.''") also see [[Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill]] Retrieved 17 May 2006</ref>. The monarch is an integral part of Parliament (as the "[[Crown-in-Parliament]]"), and theoretically gives Parliament the power to meet and create legislation. An [[Act of Parliament]] does not become law until it has been signed by the monarch (known as [[Royal Assent]]), although not one has refused assent to a bill that has been approved by Parliament since [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1708<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/hlctso29.htm |title=Royal Assent |accessdate= 2006-05-17}}</ref>. Although the abolition of the monarchy has been suggested, the popularity of the monarchy remains strong in the United Kingdom.  Support for a [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|British republic]] usually fluctuates between 15% and 25% of the population, with roughly 10% undecided or indifferent.<ref name = "Mori">"[http://www.mori.com/mrr/2000/c000616.shtml Polls Apart? The Public and the Monarchy]", Market & Opinion Research International, 16 June 2000, Retrieved 14 May 2006.</ref> The monarch is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]] who acceded to the throne in 1952 and was crowned in 1953.

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is the national legislature of the United Kingdom. It is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom, according to the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] (however, questions over sovereignty have been brought forward because of the {{abbr|UK}}'s entry in to the European Union<ref name = "Times20050914">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1779849,00.htm Europe Wins The Power To Jail British Citizens] ''[[The Times]]'', [[September 14]], [[2005]] </ref>).  It is [[bicameral]], composed of the elected [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the unelected [[House of Lords]], whose members are mostly appointed. The House of Commons is the most powerful of the two houses. The House of Commons houses 646 members who are directly elected from single-member constituencies based on population. The House of Lords has around 700 members (though the number is not fixed), constituted of [[life peers]], [[hereditary peers]], and bishops of the [[Church of England]]. (Note: The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic inheritance of seats in the Lords and permitted just 92 hereditary peers to remain. The Church of England is the [[established church]] of the state in England <ref>{{cite web | |url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history/ |title=The History of the Church of England |publisher=The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England|accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>.)

Since the 1920s, the two largest political parties in British politics have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of [[Parliamentary]] politics, the [[Plurality electoral system|first-past-the-post]] electoral system used for [[Elections in the United Kingdom|general elections]] tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament<ref name = "BBC2005">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/past_elections/html/default.stm General Election results through time, 1945–2001] BBC News, Accessed [[May 19]], [[2006]]</ref>. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] are the third largest party in the British parliament and actively seek a reform of the electoral system to address the dominance of the two-party system<ref>[http://www.libdems.org.uk/media/documents/policies/22Constitution.pdf Constitutional Reform] Liberal Democrats election change proposals, Accessed [[May 19]], [[2006]] </ref>.

Though many in the United Kingdom consider themselves 'British' as well as 'English', 'Scottish', 'Welsh', or 'Irish' (and increasingly also 'Afro-Caribbean', 'Indian', or 'Pakistani'), there has long been a widespread sense of separate national identities in the nations of Scotland and Wales and amongst the Catholic and Protestant communities in Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite web|| date=[[2004-01-08]] |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=448 |title= National Identity in Wales |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate= 2006-05-16}}</ref><ref>[http://www.scottishindependenceparty.org/ Scottish Independence Party website] Retrieved on 16-05-2006</ref><ref>{{cite web|coauthors=Karen Trew & Cate Cox | date=[[1999-06-28]] |url= http://www.ccruni.gov.uk/research/qub/trew95.htm |title=Dimensions of social identity in Northern Ireland |publisher= [[Queen's University of Belfast]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>. Independence for the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1922 provided only a partial solution to what had been termed in the 19th century the 'Irish Question', and competing demands for a [[united Ireland]] or continued union with Great Britain have brought civil strife and political instability up to the present day.

Though 'nationalist' (as opposed to 'unionist') tendencies have shifted over time in Scotland and Wales, with the [[Plaid Cymru]] (the Party of Wales) in 1925 and [[Scottish National Party]] founded in 1934, a serious political crisis threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom as a state has not occurred since the 1970s. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and government alongside that of the United Kingdom. However, this increased [[autonomous entity|autonomy]] and [[devolution]] of executive and legislative powers has not contributed to a reduction in support for independence from the United Kingdom, with the rise of new pro-independence parties. For example, the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] have gained popularity in recent years but have not significantly dented the parliamentary dominance on the three main parties.

[[Image:Stormont_Parliamentary_Building_01.JPG|thumb|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] in [[Stormont]], [[Belfast]], seat of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]]]

Tendencies to devolution with the wider United Kingdom have had only little resonance in England. There is little appetite for a [[devolved English parliament]], although senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have voiced concerns in regard to the [[West Lothian Question]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones |first=George | date=[[2006-01-17]] |url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/17/nscot17.xml |title=Baker seeks end to West Lothian question |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| date=[[2006-03-10]] |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4792120.stm |title=No English parliament — Falconer |publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>, which is raised where certain policies for England are set by MPs from all four constituent nations whereas similar policies for Scotland or Wales might be decided in the devolved assemblies by legislators from those countries alone. Alternative proposals for English [[English regions|regional]] government have stalled, following a poorly received referendum on devolved government for the [[North East England|North East of England]], which had hitherto been considered the region most in favour of the idea. England is therefore governed according to the balance of parties across the whole of the United Kingdom.

The resurgence in [[Modern Celts|Celtic]] language and identity, as well as 'regional' politics and development, has contributed to forces pulling against the unity of the state <ref> [http://www.manxman.co.im/cleague/  The Celtic League], accessed May 20 2006 </ref>. However, there is at present little sign of any imminent 'crisis' (at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|last General Election]], both the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] saw their percentage of the overall vote drop, though the SNP did gain two more seats and are the second largest party in the [[Scottish Parliament]] as well as official opposition).  Nevertheless, recent opinion polls have suggested that nationalism (i.e. a desire to break up the UK) is rising within Scotland and England. However, the polls have been known to be inaccurate in the past (for example, in the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]]).  Moreover, polls carried out in the 1970s and the 1990s showed similar results, only to be debunked at elections. In early [[2007]] in line with reporting on English and Scottish attitudes towards the [[Act of Union]], two polls, one for the Sunday Times of the 14th of January 2007 and another poll, shown on [[BBC]] News at Ten on the fifteenth of January both showed a vast majority in both countries favouring the retention of the union. Indeed, while support for breaking up the UK was strongest in Scotland, there was still a clear lead for unionism over nationalism. See http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6263807.stm. In Northern Ireland, there has been a significant decrease in violence over the last twenty years, though the situation remains tense, with the more hard-line parties such as [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Democratic Unionist]]s now holding the most parliamentary seats (see [[Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland]]).

==Law==
{{main|Law of the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:Parliament House, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|[[Parliament House, Edinburgh]] is the seat of the supreme courts of Scotland.]]

The United Kingdom has three distinct systems of law. [[English law]], which applies in [[England and Wales]], and [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]], which applies in Northern Ireland, are based on [[common law|common-law]] principles. [[Scots law]], which applies in Scotland, is a hybrid system based on both common-law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] principles. The [[Act of Union 1707]] guarantees the continued existence of a separate law system for Scotland.

The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is the highest court in the land for all criminal and civil cases in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], and for all civil cases in Scots law. Recent constitutional changes will see the powers of the House of Lords transfer to a new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]. <ref> "[http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom]", [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], Accessed [[2006-05-22]]. {{PDFlink}} </ref> 

In [[England and Wales]] the [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] (for civil cases) and the [[Crown Court]] (for criminal cases). In [[Scotland]] the chief courts are the [[Court of Session]], for civil cases, and the [[High Court of Justiciary]], for criminal cases, while the [[sheriff court]] is the Scottish equivalent of the county court.

The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the {{abbr|UK}} overseas territories, and the British crown dependencies.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:Uk-map.svg|thumb|left|Map of the United Kingdom]]

=== Topography ===

Most of England consists of rolling lowland terrain, divided east from west by more mountainous terrain in the Northwest ([[Cumbrian Mountains]] of the [[Lake District]]) and north (the upland moors of the [[Pennines]]) and [[limestone]] hills of the [[Peak District]] by the [[Tees-Exe line]]. The lower [[limestone]] hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Cotswolds]], [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] and [[chalk]] downs of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]]. The main rivers and estuaries are the [[Thames]], [[Severn]] and the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. The largest urban area is [[Greater London]]. Near [[Dover, England|Dover]], the [[Channel Tunnel]] links the United Kingdom with [[France]]. <ref> [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uk.html#Geo Geography of the United Kingdom] CIA, Accessed [[22 May]] [[2006]] </ref> There is no peak in [[England]] that is 1,000 [[metre]]s (3,300&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) or greater, the highest mountain being [[Scafell Pike]] in England's [[Lake District]], at some 978 metres (3,208 ft).

[[Scotland's geography]] is varied, with [[Scottish Lowlands|lowlands]] in the south and east and [[Scottish Highlands|highlands]] in the north and west, including [[Ben Nevis]], the highest mountain in the British Isles at 1,343 metres (4,406&nbsp;ft). There are many long and deep-sea arms, [[firth]]s, and [[loch]]s. Scotland has nearly 800 [[Scottish islands|islands]], mainly west and north of the mainland, notably the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]]. The capital city is [[Edinburgh]], the centre of which is a [[World Heritage Site]]. The largest city is [[Glasgow]] <ref> [http://www.heritage-of-scotland.com/geog.htm Geography of Scotland] Heritage of Scotland, Accessed [[22 May]] [[2006]] </ref>.  In total it is estimated that the {{abbr|UK}} includes around 1,000 islands, with 700 in Scotland alone <ref> [http://www.celticlegend.co.uk/dialysis/scotland.htm Dialysis Scotland] Accessed [[22 May]] [[2006]] </ref>.

Wales is mostly mountainous, the highest peak being [[Snowdon]] (Yr Wyddfa) at 1,085 metres (3,560&nbsp;ft) above sea level. North of the mainland is the island of [[Anglesey]] (Ynys Môn). The largest and capital city is [[Cardiff]] (Caerdydd); it has been the Welsh Capital city since 1955, located in [[South Wales]]. <ref> [http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/culture/sites/aboutwales/pages/geography.shtml Geography of Wales] [[BBC]] Wales, Accessed [[22 May]] [[2006]] </ref> The greatest concentration of people live in the south, in the cities of [[Swansea]] (Abertawe) and [[Newport]] (Casnewydd), as well as Cardiff, and the [[South Wales Valleys]]. The largest town in [[North Wales]] is [[Wrexham]] (Wrecsam).

Northern Ireland, making up the north-eastern part of Ireland, is mostly hilly. The capital is [[Belfast]] ('Béal Feirste' in [[Irish language|Irish]]), with other major cities being [[Derry]] ('Doire' in [[Irish language|Irish]]) and [[Newry]] ('Iúr Cinn Trá' in Irish). The province is home to one of the {{abbr|UK}}’s [[World Heritage Sites]], the [[Giant's Causeway]], which consists of more than 40,000 six-sided basalt columns up to 40 feet (12&nbsp;m) high. [[Lough Neagh]], the largest body of water in the [[British Isles]], by surface area (388&nbsp;km²&nbsp;/&nbsp;150&nbsp;mi²), can be found in [[Northern Ireland]]. <ref> [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm Geography of Northern Ireland] [[University of Ulster]] Accessed [[May 22]] [[2006]] </ref>. The highest peak is [[Slieve Donard]] at 849 metres (2,786&nbsp;ft) in the province's [[Mourne Mountains]].

===Climate===

{{main|Climate of the United Kingdom }}

[[England]] has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round, though the seasons are quite variable in temperature. However, temperatures extremely rarely fall below −15&nbsp;°C (5&nbsp;°F) and will only rise above 34&nbsp;°C (93.2&nbsp;°F) in the height of the summer. The prevailing wind is from the south west, bringing mild and wet weather to England regularly, from the Atlantic Ocean. It is driest in the east and warmest in the south east, which is closest to the European mainland. Snowfall can occur in Winter and early Spring, though it is not that common away from high ground.

The highest temperature recorded in England is 38.5&nbsp;°C (101.3&nbsp;°F) on [[10 August]] [[2003]] at Brogdale, near Faversham, Kent. [1]. The lowest temperature ever recorded in England is −26.1&nbsp;°C (−15.0&nbsp;°F) on [[10 January]] [[1982]] at Edgmond, near Newport, Shropshire. [2]

[[Wales]]' climate is alike in most regards to that of England, with the highest maximum temperature recorded at 35.2&nbsp;°C (95.4&nbsp;°F) in Hawarden Bridge, Flintshire on [[2 August]] [[1990]] and the lowest minimum temperature at -23.3&nbsp;°C (-10&nbsp;°F) in Rhayader, Radnorshire on [[21 January]] [[1940]]. [1]

The climate of [[Scotland]] is temperate and oceanic, and tends to be very changeable. It is warmed by the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic, and as such is much warmer than areas on similar latitudes, for example Oslo, Norway. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the {{abbr|UK}}, with the coldest ever {{abbr|UK}} temperature of -27.2 °C (-17.0&nbsp;°F) recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains, on [[11 February]] [[1895]] and [[10 January]] [[1982]] and also at Altnaharra, Highland, on [[30 December]] [[1995]]. Winter maximums average 6&nbsp;°C (42.8&nbsp;°F) in the lowlands, with summer maximums averaging 18&nbsp;°C (64.4&nbsp;°F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.9&nbsp;°C (91.2&nbsp;°F) at Greycrook, Scottish Borders on [[9 August]] [[2003]].

Generally, western Scotland is warmer than the east because of the influence of the Atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea. [[Tiree]], in the Inner Hebrides, is the sunniest place in Scotland: it had 300 days with sunshine in 1975. Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest place, with annual rainfall exceeding 120 [[inch]]es (3,000&nbsp;mm). In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 31 inches (800&nbsp;mm) annually. Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar experiences an average of 59 snow days per year, while coastal areas have an average of less than 10 days.

The whole of [[Northern Ireland]] has a temperate maritime climate, rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is persistent across the region. The weather is comparatively unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America. Average daytime maximums in Belfast are 6.5&nbsp;°C (43.7&nbsp;°F) in January and 17.5&nbsp;°C (63.5&nbsp;°F) in July. The damp climate and extensive deforestation in the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in much of the region being covered in rich green grassland. The highest maximum temperature was set at 30.8&nbsp;°C (87.4&nbsp;°F) at Knockarevan, near Belleek, County Fermanagh on [[30 June]] [[1976]] and at Belfast on [[12 July]] [[1983]], whilst the lowest minimum temperature recorded at -17.5&nbsp;°C (0.5&nbsp;°F) at Magherally, near Banbridge, County Down on [[1 January]] [[1979]]. [16]

The United Kingdom, along with the rest of Europe, has been hit by a heat wave during the summer months in recent years. The heat waves have been the cause of many deaths due to the temperatures nearing the 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F) mark.

===Cities===

{{main|City status in the United Kingdom}}

There are many different statistics and debates on which cities are the {{abbr|UK}}'s largest, due to differences between the administrative boundaries and metropolitan areas of cities, and because of merging of settlements into conurbations. The four capitals of the United Kingdom's constituent countries are [[London]] (England), [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland), [[Cardiff]] (Wales) and [[Belfast]] (Northern Ireland). London is by far the {{abbr|UK}}'s largest city. After that, the definition of largest is dependent upon the criteria used, but no one city stands out as larger than the others.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:Nelson's Column Looking Towards Westminster - Trafalgar Square - London - 240404.jpg|thumb|[[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]] is one of the most famous public places in the United Kingdom.]]

=== Population ===
At the April [[2001 UK Census|2001 {{abbr|UK}} Census]], the United Kingdom's population was 58,789,194, the third-largest in the [[European Union]] (behind [[Germany]] and [[France]]) and the twenty-first largest in the world. This had been estimated up to 59,834,300 <ref>"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=6 UK population approaches 60 million]", Office for National Statistics, 25 August 2005; Retrieved 14 May 2006.</ref> by the [[Office for National Statistics]] in 2004. Two years later it had increased to 60.2 million, largely from net immigration, but also because of a rising birth rate and increasing life expectancy. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1857779,00.html |title=Rising birth rate, longevity and migrants push population to more than 60 million |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref>

Its overall population density is one of the highest in the world. About a quarter of the population lives in England's prosperous south-east <ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/pyramids/pages/j.asp Census 2001: South East], Office for National Statistics. Retrieved 14 May 2006.</ref> and is predominantly urban and suburban, with an estimated 7,517,700 in the capital of London. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/subreports/pop_time_series/report.aspx |title=All people population: City of London |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref> The United Kingdom's high literacy rate (99%) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humana.org/Article.asp?TxtID=223&SubMenuItemID=183&MenuItemID=43 |title=United Kingdom |publisher=Humana |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> is attributable to universal public education introduced for the primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900 (except in Scotland where it was introduced in 1696, see [[Education in Scotland]]). Education is mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August).

=== Migration ===
{{main|Ethnic groups of the United Kingdom}}
Located as they are on a group of islands close to [[Continental Europe]], the lands now constituting the United Kingdom have historically been subject to many invasions and migrations, especially from Scandinavia and the continent - including Roman occupation for several centuries. Present day Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic stocks that settled there before the eleventh century. The pre-Celtic, Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse influences were blended on Great Britain under the Normans, Scandinavian Vikings who had lived in Northern France. 

More recent immigration has come through interaction with continental [[Europe]] and international ties forged by the [[British Empire]]. Since [[World War Two]]  the {{abbr|UK}} has absorbed substantial immigration, with Europe, Africa and South Asia being the biggest areas from where people currently emigrate. As of [[2001 British Census|2001]], 13.1% of the {{abbr|UK}}'s population identified themselves as an [[ethnic minority]].<ref> [http://www.cre.gov.uk/diversity/map.html] Commission for Racial Equality: Multi Ethnic Britain </ref>
The United Kingdom has amongst the highest immigration rates in Europe, along with [[Italy]] and [[Spain]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/immigration/story/0,,1852513,00.html|title=Immigration fails to stem European population loss | date=2006-08-17| accessdate=2006-08-20| publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>.  In some {{abbr|UK}} cities the percentage of '[[minority group]]s' is large but is still less than half, for example; London 40.1%,<ref name="CRE London">{{cite web|url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/diversity/map/london/index.html|title=London|publisher=[[Commission for Racial Equality]]}}</ref> Birmingham (UK's 2nd largest city) 34.4%<ref name="CRE Birmingham">{{cite web|url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/diversity/map/westmidlands/birmingham.html|title=Birmingham[[Commission for Racial Equality]]}}</ref> and Leicester 39.5%<ref name="CRE Leicester">{{cite web|url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/diversity/map/eastmidlands/leicester.html|title=Leicester[[Commission for Racial Equality]]}}</ref>.

The most recent pattern of immigration to the {{abbr|UK}} began in May 2004 when the European Union was expanded. From May 2004 to September 2006, around 500,000 people from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] immigrated to the {{abbr|UK}} to work.<ref>Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue & Customs and Department for Communities and Local Government, [http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/6353/aboutus/accessionmonitoringreport9.pdf Accession Monitoring Report: May 2004-September 2006], 21 November 2006, accessed 22 November 2006.</ref> This figure is for arrivals only and does not take account of people leaving, hence [[Net migration rate|net migration]] is likely to be lower.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5273356.stm 'Nearly 600,000' new EU migrants], [[BBC]], 22 August 2006. Retrieved 22 August 2006.</ref> In 2005 net migration from the new EU states stood at 64,000.<ref name="ONS"/>

The UK also has a high rate of [[emigration]].  A study<ref>Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah and Catherine Drew, ''[http://www.ippr.org/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=509 Brits Abroad: Mapping the scale and nature of British emigration]'', London: [[Institute for Public Policy Research]], 11 December 2006, accessed 20 January 2007 (see also [http://www.bbc.co.uk/britsabroad www.bbc.co.uk/britsabroad]).</ref> in 2006 found that at least 5.5 million British-born people live abroad. Another half a million now live or work abroad for part of the year.

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Anglospeak.png|right|thumb|300px|Countries where [[English language|English]] has official or ''de facto'' official language status.]]
Whilst the {{abbr|UK}} does not have an official language, the predominant [[spoken language]] is [[English language|English]]. This is a [[West Germanic]] language, descended from [[Old English]], featuring a large number of borrowings from [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman]]. The other indigenous languages are [[Scots language|Scots]] (which is closely related to English) and the [[Insular Celtic languages]] (which are not). The latter fall into two groups: the P-Celtic languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] and the [[Cornish language]]); and the Q-Celtic languages ([[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]). Celtic dialectal influences from [[Cumbric]] persisted in Northern England for many centuries, most famously in a unique set of numbers used for counting sheep. 

The English language has spread to all corners of the world (essentially due to the British Empire in the 19th and early 20th century) and has thus become the business language of the world. Worldwide, it is taught [[English language learning and teaching|as a second language]] more than any other. <ref> [http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=2055 English-Language Dominance, Literature and Welfare] Melitz, Jacques; Centre for Economic Policy Research; 1999; Accessed May 26 2006 </ref> The United Kingdom's Celtic languages are also spoken by small groups around the globe, mainly [[Scottish Gaelic in Canada|Gaelic]] in Nova Scotia, [[Canada]], and Welsh in [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].

Recent immigrants, especially from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], speak many other languages, including [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Polish Language|Polish]]. The United Kingdom has the largest number of [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]] , [[Bengali]], and [[Punjabi]] speakers outside of Asia.

=== Religion ===
{{main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:Canterbury Cathedral - Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|[[Canterbury Cathedral]], one of the oldest and most famous Christian structures in the {{abbr|UK}}.]]

[[Christianity]] was first introduced to Britain by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]], and the UK remains an officially Christian country. This is reflected throughout British public life - for instance there is an established church in England and a national church in Scotland. The Head of State is a Christian monarch crowned by an Archbishop in Westminster Abbey. British society could be said to belong to the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition, and the majority of people in the UK, 72%, identify themselves as Christian. <ref name="Christians">"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=293 Census shows 72% identify as Christians]", Office for National Statistics, Retrieved 14 May 2006</ref><ref name="Atheists">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurobarometer poll conducted in 2005] European Commission, Retrieved 07 December 2006</ref>, 

Each of the four nations of the United Kingdom have distinctive church traditions.

[[Augustine of Canterbury]] was sent to England by [[Pope Gregory I]] in in 597AD; northern parts of Great Britain were evangelised by Celtic missionaries from Ireland, such as [[Saint Columba|Columba]] and [[Saint Aidan|Aidan]]. The  English Church split from [[Church of Rome|Rome]] in 1534 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]]. Today the [[Church of England]] is the officially established [[Christian]] church in England, and acts as the 'mother' and senior branch of the worldwide Anglican Communion, and some of her bishops sit in the [[House of Lords]]. The [[British monarch]] is required to be a member of the Church of England under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]. [[Roman Catholic]]s are expressly forbidden from becoming monarch, stemming from conflict over the crown and whether Britain was in the past, Catholic or [[Protestant]]. The senior bishop of Church of England is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

[[Image:Westminster abbey west.jpg|thumb|right|[[Westminster Abbey]] is used for the [[Coronation]] of all British Monarchs, who are also made the head of the [[Church of England]].]]

The [[Church of Scotland]] (known informally as The Kirk), also has its roots in the [[Reformation]], breaking with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1560 (see [[Scottish Reformation]]). Today it is a [[Presbyterian]] church and, although recognised as the national church in Scotland, is not subject to state control in spiritual matters. The British monarch is an ordinary member, and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the Church at the coronation. The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which is part of the [[Anglican communion]], dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690. Although it is in [[full communion]] with the [[Church of England]], it is not a 'daughter church' of the Church of England, as it is proud of its own distinct origins and history . Unlike the Church of England, the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church are nowadays elected by church members. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the 19th century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland  including the [[Free Church of Scotland]]. 
 
In the 1920s, the [[Church in Wales]] was separated from the Church of England and became disestablished, i.e. lost its "official" status as the state religion.  However the Church in Wales remains in the [[Anglican Communion]]. [[Methodism]] and other independent churches are traditionally strong in Wales.

The Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished in the 19th century. It covers all of the island of [[Ireland]], both the Province of [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In Northern Ireland the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic Church in Ireland]] is the largest single denomination, although [[Protestant]]s are in the majority overall. The [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] is the largest Protestant denomination and is in terms of theology and history closely linked to the Church of Scotland

The [[Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain|Roman Catholic Church]] is the second largest denomination of Christianity in the {{abbr|UK}}. After the [[Reformation]], strict laws were passed against Catholics; these were removed by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] laws in the 1850s. There are separate Catholic hierarchies for [[England and Wales]], [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].

Other large Christian groups include the [[Methodists]] (founded by [[John Wesley]] in London) and the Baptists. There are also growing [[Evangelical]] or [[Pentecostal]] churches, many of which have flourished with immigration from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and beyond.

Modern day Britain is very diverse in terms of religion. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] have many followers in the {{abbr|UK}}; [[Sikhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]] and other religions have smaller numbers. 14.6% of the population identify themselves as having no religious beliefs.

Muslims are believed to number over 1.8 million, with many of them living in towns and cities including London, Birmingham, Bradford and Oldham.<ref>  {{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3933-2299410,00.html |title=We need imams who can speak to young Muslims in their own words |accessdate=2006-08-09 |date=2006-08-05 |publisher=[[The Times]]}} </ref> Mosques are a common sight in some parts of modern day Britain. The biggest groups of [[British Muslims]] are of [[Pakistan]]i, [[Bangladesh]]i and [[India]]n origin. More recently, smaller numbers of [[refugees]]  from [[Somalia]], [[Turkey]], [[Balkan]] and the [[Arab]] countries have  lightly increased Britain's [[Muslim]] population. The 2006 controversy over the [[burqa]], brought up in comments by [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], reflects a split between some Britons questioning the extent to which traditionalist forms of Islam are compatible with British society, and others happier with the form of Islam in Britain.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/10/07/uk.straw/ |title=Veil: British papers back Straw |accessdate=2006-05-11 |date=2006-07-10 |publisher=[[CNN]]}} </ref>

The other religions of [[India]]n origin, like [[Hinduism]] and [[Sikhism]] also enjoy an increased following in Britain. As of the 2001 census, there are about 560,000 Hindus and 340,000 Sikhs. <ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:London night.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[City of London]], the largest [[financial]] centre in Europe]]

For over 25 years the British economy has been  home to what became known  in the 1980s as the [[Anglo-Saxon economy|Anglo-Saxon model]], focusing on the principles of liberalisation, the [[free market]], 'common law' relating to property, and low taxation and regulation. Based on [[market]] [[exchange rate]]s, the United Kingdom is the fifth largest economy in the world; <ref>"[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=2005&ED=2005&R1=1&R2=1&CS=3&SS=2&OS=C&DD=0&OUT=1&C=512-941-914-446-612-666-614-672-311-946-213-137-911-962-193-674-122-676-912-548-313-556-419-678-513-181-316-682-913-684-124-273-339-921-638-948-514-686-218-688-963-518-616-728-223-558-516-138-918-353-748-196-618-278-522-692-622-694-156-142-624-449-626-564-628-283-228-853-924-288-233-293-632-566-636-964-634-182-238-453-662-968-960-922-423-714-935-862-128-716-611-456-321-722-243-965-248-718-469-724-253-576-642-936-643-961-939-813-644-199-819-184-172-524-132-361-646-362-648-364-915-732-134-366-652-734-174-144-328-146-258-463-656-528-654-923-336-738-263-578-268-537-532-742-944-866-176-369-534-744-536-186-429-925-178-746-436-926-136-466-343-112-158-111-439-298-916-927-664-846-826-299-542-582-443-474-917-754-544-698&S=NGDPD&CMP=0&x=31&y=8 Report for Selected Countries and Subjects]", International Monetary Fund, 2005. Retrieved 15 May 2006.</ref>, the second largest in Europe after [[Germany]], and the fifth-largest overall by [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|GDP (nominal)]].

The British were the first in the world to enter the [[Industrial Revolution]], and, like most industrialising countries at the time, initially concentrated on heavy industries such as [[shipbuilding]], [[coal mining]], [[steel]] production, and [[textiles]]. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the United Kingdom to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised and surplus labour from agriculture began to dry up, the United Kingdom began to lose its economic advantage. As a result, heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. The British service sector, however, has grown substantially, and now makes up about 73% of GDP. <ref>{{cite web| date=[[2006-04-26]] |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=9333 |title=Index of Services (experimental) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>

The service sector of the United Kingdom is dominated by [[financial services]], especially in banking and insurance. London is one of the world's largest financial centres with the [[London Stock Exchange]], the [[London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange]], and the [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance market all based in the city. It also has the largest concentration of foreign bank branches in the world. In the past decade, a rival financial centre in London has grown in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area, with [[HSBC]], [[Citigroup]], and [[Barclays plc|Barclays Bank]] all relocating their head offices there. The Scottish capital, [[Edinburgh]] also has one of the large financial centres of [[Europe]] <ref>"[http://www.marklazarowicz.org.uk/parliament/speeches2003/4.30(WH).htm Debate on Scottish financial services industry]", [[Mark Lazarowicz]] Labour MP, 30 April 2003. Retrieved 16 May 2006.</ref>.

[[Tourism in the United Kingdom|Tourism]] is very important to the British economy. With over 27 million tourists a year, the United Kingdom is [[World Tourism Rankings|ranked]] as the sixth major tourist destination in the world. <ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.world-tourism.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/2005_eng_high.pdf |title=International Tourism Receipts |format={{PDFlink}} |work=UNWTO Tourism Highlights, Edition 2005 |pages=12 |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] | language= |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>

The British manufacturing sector, however, has greatly diminished since World War II. It is still a significant part of the economy, but only accounted for one-sixth of national output in 2003.<ref>[http://www.dti.gov.uk/ministers/speeches/hewitt150704b.html TUC Manufacturing Conference], [[Patricia Hewitt]] speech, Department for Trade and Industry, 15 July. Retrieved 16 May 2006.</ref>. The [[British motor industry]] is a significant part of this sector, although all large-volume producers are now foreign-owned. Civil and defence aircraft production is led by the United Kingdom's largest aerospace firm, [[BAE Systems]], and the pan-European consortium known as [[Airbus]]. [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] holds a major share of the global aerospace engines market. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is also strong in the {{abbr|UK}}, with the world's second and third largest pharmaceutical firms ([[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[AstraZeneca]], respectively) being based in the {{abbr|UK}}. {{citation needed}}

The United Kingdom's agriculture sector accounts for only 0.9% of GDP.<ref>[http://www.travlang.com/factbook/print/uk.html CIA World Factbook - United Kingdom]</ref>
 
The {{abbr|UK}} has large coal, [[natural gas]], and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves, although the [[natural gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves are diminishing. Primary energy production accounts for about 10% of [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP), {{citation needed}} one of the highest shares of any industrial state. 

The currency of the {{abbr|UK}} is the [[pound sterling]], represented by the symbol £. The [[Bank of England]] is the [[central bank]], responsible for issuing currency.  Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover the issue. The {{abbr|UK}} chose not to join the [[Euro]] at the currency's launch, although the government has pledged to hold a public referendum for deciding membership if "five economic tests" are met. <ref name="fivetests" /> {{abbr|UK}} Public opinion is against the notion. <ref>{{cite web| date=[[2005-02-28]] |url=http://www.mori.com/polls/2005/citigroup-feb.shtml |title=EMU Entry And EU Constitution |publisher=[[MORI]] |accessdate=2006-05-17}}</ref>

Government involvement throughout the economy is exercised by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] ([[Gordon Brown]]) who heads [[HM Treasury]], but the [[Prime Minister]] ([[Tony Blair]]), is [[First Lord of the Treasury]] (the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] being the Second Lord of the Treasury). However since 1997, the [[Bank of England]], headed by the [[Governor of the Bank of England]], has control of interest rates and other monetary policy. The UK government has greatly increased [[public sector]] spending (i.e.: government spending of taxes) since 1995, and annual spending on investment in infrastructure has grown from £5.6bn in 1997 to £29bn in 2006.

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in the United Kingdom}}
The transport system in the United Kingdom is well developed. A radial road network of 29,145 miles (46,632 km) of main roads is centred on [[London]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Belfast]], whilst, in [[Great Britain]], a motorway network of 2,173 miles (3,477 km) is centred on [[Manchester]],[[Birmingham]] and London. There are a further 213,750 miles (342,000 km) of paved roads. The [[National Rail]] network of 10,072 route miles (16,116 route km) in Great Britain and 189 route miles (303 route km) in [[Northern Ireland]] carries over 18,000 passenger and 1,000 freight trains daily. Urban rail networks are also well developed in London and several other cities. [[Heathrow Airport]] is the world's busiest international [[airport]], and the UK has a considerable network of ports which received over 558 million tonnes of goods in 2003-04.

The government department overseeing transport is the [[Department for Transport]].

[[Image:WCML and M1.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[West Coast Main Line]] railway, alongside the [[M1 motorway]]]]

===Transport trends===
Since 1952 (the earliest date for which comparable figures are available), the UK has seen a dramatic shift away from the use of public transport and towards the use of private transport, for both passengers and freight.

In 1952 just 27% of distance travelled was by car or taxi; with 42% being by bus or coach and 18% by rail. A further 11% was by bicycle and 3% by motorcycle. The distance travelled by air was negligible.

By 2003 85% of distance travelled was by car or taxi; with just 6% being by bus and 6% by rail. Air, pedal cycle and motorcycle accounted for roughly 1% each. In terms of journeys, slightly over 1 billion are made per annum by main line rail, 1.1 billion by London Underground and other metro systems, 4.5 billion by bus, and 21 million on domestic air flights.

Passenger transport has grown significantly in recent years.  Figures from the DTI <ref>http://www.dtistats.net/energystats/ecuk2_2.xls Passenger kilometres by bus, rail, air, motorcycle, pedal cycle, 1970 to 2004, URN No: 06/453, DTI</ref> show that total passenger travel inside the UK has risen from 403 billion passenger kilometres in 1970 to 797 billion in 2004.

Freight transport has undergone similar changes, greatly increasing in volume and shifting from railways onto the road. In 1953 89 billion tonne kilometres of goods were moved, with rail accounting for 42%, road 36% and water 22%. By 2002 the volume of freight moved had almost trebled to 254 billion tonne kilometres, of which 7.5% was moved by rail, 26% by water, 4% by pipeline and 62% by road.

This shift from rail to road is both caused by, and a cause of, changes in the relative sizes of their networks; wheareas the rail network has halved from 31,336&nbsp;km in 1950 to 16,116 km today, the motorway network, which today is 3476 km long, did not exist in 1950. It has also been caused by rising economic affluence, the move of the population away from city centres, and changes in industry.

===Railways===
:''Main articles: [[Rail transport in Great Britain]]'', ''[[Rail transport in Ireland]]''

The rail network in the United Kingdom consists of two independent parts, that of [[Northern Ireland]] and that of [[Great Britain]]. Since 1994, the latter has been connected to [[mainland Europe]] via the [[Channel Tunnel]]. The network of Northern Ireland is connected to that of the [[Republic of Ireland]].

====Great Britain====
[[Image:390029 'City of Stoke-on-Trent' at Birmingham New Street.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Virgin Trains|Virgin]]'s [[Pendolino]] train]]

The rail network in Great Britain is the oldest such network in the world. The world's first intercity railway was the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], designed by [[George Stephenson]] and opened by the [[Prime Minister]], the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] on [[15 September]] [[1830]].

<!--(need more added in here, such as Railway Mania, Big Four, Nationalisation, Beeching Axe, etc.)''-->
Until 1996 the rail network in Britain, and the passenger and freight services on it, were owned, operated and maintained by [[British Rail]], a government-owned monopoly. In 1994 and 1995 British Rail was split into infrastructure, maintenance, rolling stock, passenger and freight companies, which were [[privatised]] from 1996 to 1997. Privatisation has proved controversial and the rail network has not yet experienced the full improvements that had been hoped.

In Britain, the infrastructure (track, stations, depots and signalling chiefly) is owned and maintained by [[Network Rail]], a [[non profit|not for profit]] company. Network Rail replaced [[Railtrack]], which became bankrupt in 2002 following the [[Hatfield rail crash|Hatfield Accident]] in 2000. Passenger services are operated by [[List of companies operating trains in the United Kingdom|train operating companies]](TOCs), most of which are franchises awarded by the UK Government. Examples include [[First Group]], [[Great North Eastern Railway|GNER]] and [[Virgin Trains]]. Freight trains are operated by Freight Operating Companies, such as [[EWS]], which are commercial operations unsupported by government. Most Train Operating Companies do not own the locomotives and coaches which they use to operate passenger services. Instead, they are required to lease these from the three [[Rail transport in Great Britain#Leasing services|ROSCOs]], Rolling Stock Operating Companies, with train maintenance carried out by companies such as [[Bombardier]].

In [[Great Britain]] there is 16,536 km of 1435 mm [[standard gauge|gauge]] track. 4,928 km of track is electrified and 12,591 km is double or multiple tracks. The maximum scheduled speed on the regular network has historically been around 125 [[miles per hour]] (200 km/h), on the [[Inter-City]] lines. On the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]], linking London with the Channel Tunnel, trains are now able to go at the speeds of French [[TGV]]s.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, [[Northern Ireland Railways|Northern Ireland Railways (NIR)]] both owns the infrastructure and operates passenger rail services. The Northern Ireland rail network is one of the few networks in Europe that carry no freight. It is publicly owned. NIR was united in 1996 with Northern Ireland's two publicly owned bus operators — [[Ulsterbus]] and Metro (formally [[Metro (Belfast)|Citybus]]) — under the brand [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]].

In [[Northern Ireland]] there is 342 km of track at 1600 mm [[broad gauge|gauge]]. 190 km of it is multiple track.

====Rapid transit====
Four cities in the UK have [[rapid transit]] systems. Most well known is the [[London Underground]] (known as the Tube), the oldest and longest rapid transit system in the world. Also in [[London]] are the separate [[Docklands Light Railway]] (though this is integrated with the Underground in many ways), and the [[North London Line]], operated by [[Silverlink]] (formerly by [[British Rail]]). Outside of London there is the [[Glasgow Subway]], [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] and [[Merseyrail]] in Liverpool.

====Trams and Light Rail====
[[Image:OldTram 700.jpg|thumb|150px|A vintage British tram, preserved at the [[National Tramway Museum]]]]

[[Tram]] systems were popular in the UK in the late 19th and early 20th century. However with the rise of the [[automobile|car]] they began to be widely dismantled in the 1950s. By 1962 only [[Blackpool tramway]] remained. However in recent years trams have seen a revival in the UK, as in other countries. Examples of this second generation of tram systems include: 
*[[Manchester Metrolink]] in [[Greater Manchester]]
*[[Sheffield Supertram]] in [[Sheffield]]
*[[Midland Metro]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]
*[[Tramlink]] in [[Croydon]]
*[[Nottingham Express Transit|NET]] in [[Nottingham]]

Edinburgh and Glasgow are soon to get light rail train services in their cities.

{{see also|Category:Tram transport in the United Kingdom|Trams in London|Trams_in_Europe}}

===Roads===
The [[road]] network in the United Kingdom is extensive, with around 370,000&nbsp;km of road, and is one of, if not the most, popular method of transportation.  A high-speed [[motorway]] system, with a total length of 3300&nbsp;km, was constructed from the 1950s onwards, and links all major cities (though part of the [[A74 road|A74]] linking England and Scotland has not yet been upgraded).  The maximum speed limit is 70 [[miles per hour]] (113&nbsp;km/h).  Alongside the motorway system are [[trunk roads]], many of which are [[dual carriageway]], various A and B roads, and many unclassified roads.

The [[Highways Agency]] (a division of the Department of Transport) is responsible for maintaining motorways and trunk roads in [[England]]. Other English roads are maintained by [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]]. In [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] roads are the responsibility of the [[Scottish Executive]] and [[Welsh Assembly]] respectively. Northern Ireland's roads are overseen by the Roads Service, a section of the [[Department for Regional Development]].

[[Toll roads]] are rare in the United Kingdom, though there are many [[toll bridges]] such as the [[Severn crossing]].  In 2003 the UK's first toll motorway, the [[M6 Toll]] road, opened in the [[Birmingham]] area to relieve the congested [[M6 motorway]]. [[Congestion charging]] systems also operate in a few cities such as central [[London]] and [[Durham]]. The government is considering introducing further [[road pricing]] schemes.

Driving is on the left.

:''See also:'' [[Great Britain road numbering scheme]], [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom]]

====Buses====
[[Coach (vehicle)|Coach]]es provide long-distance links throughout the UK: in England & Wales the majority of coach services are provided by [[National Express]]. [[Megabus]] run no-frills coach services in competition with National Express and services in Scotland in co-operation with [[Scottish Citylink]]. Within regional areas, there is are various local [[bus]] systems which in Great Britain were usually originally owned by [[local government in the United Kingdom|local councils]], but have been deregulated and privatised under the [[Transport Act 1980]]. Since deregulation the majority of these local bus companies have been taken over by one of the "Big Four" private transport companies: [[Arriva]], [[FirstGroup plc]], [[National Express Group]] (owners of National Express) and [[Stagecoach Group]]. In Northern Ireland coach, bus (and rail) services remain regulated and are provided by [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]].

===Water===

[[Image:UKUNIV Kopie.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the UK showing the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] and the applicable jurisdictions; the [[territorial sea]] extends to no more than 12 nautical miles from land.]]

Due to the United Kingdom's [[island]] nature, before the [[Channel Tunnel]] and the advent of [[air travel]] the only way to enter or leave the country was on water, except at the border between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

====Ports and harbours====
Approximately 95% of freight enters the UK by sea (75% by value).  Three major ports handle most freight traffic:
*[[Felixstowe]] on the east coast - the fourth largest seaport in Europe.
*[[Tilbury]], near [[London]].
*[[Southampton]] on the south coast.

There are many other ports and harbours around the UK, including the following towns, cities and rivers:

[[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]], [[Avonmouth]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Barry]], [[Belfast]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], [[Dover, England|Dover]], [[Falmouth, England|Falmouth]],  [[Glasgow]], [[Gloucester, England|Gloucester]], [[Grangemouth]], [[Harwich]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Inverness]], [[Leith]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Newport]], [[Peterhead]], [[Plymouth]], [[Poole]], [[Port Talbot]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Scapa Flow]], [[Sullom Voe]], [[Swansea]], [[Tees]], [[Tyne]].

====Merchant marine====
For long periods of the last millennium Britain had the largest merchant fleet in the world, but it has slipped down the rankings. There are 429 ships of 1,000 [[GRT]] or over, making a total of 9,181,284 [[GRT]] (9,566,275 [[DWT]]).  These are split into the following types: bulk carrier 18, cargo 55, chemical tanker 48, container 134, liquefied gas 11, passenger 12, passenger/cargo 64, petroleum tanker 40, refrigerated cargo 19, roll on/roll off 25, vehicle carrier 3.  There are also 446 ships registered in other countries, and 202 foreign-owned ships registered in the UK. ''(2005 CIA estimate)''

[[Image:Mersey Ferry - River Mersey - Liverpool - 2005-06-28.jpg|thumb|200px|Mersey ferry]]

====Other shipping====
Passenger ferries operate internationally to nearby countries such as [[France]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Belgium]] and [[the Netherlands]].  Ferries also operate within the UK, connecting [[Scotland]] with [[Northern Ireland]], [[Southampton]] with [[Isle of Wight]] and many smaller routes.

[[Cruise ship]]s depart from the UK for destinations worldwide, many heading for ports around the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Caribbean]].

The [[Solent]] is a world centre for [[yachting]] and home to largest number of private yachts in the world.

====Inland waterways====
Major [[canal]] building began in the UK after the onset of the [[Industrial revolution]] in the 18th century. A large canal network was built and it became the primary method of transporting goods throughout the country. However, by the 1830s with the development of the [[railways]] the canal network began to go into decline.

There are currently  1,988 miles (3200&nbsp;km) of [[waterways in the United Kingdom]], and the primary use is recreational. 385 miles (620&nbsp;km) is used for commerce. ''(2004 CIA estimate)''

===Air transport===
''Main article: [[List of airports in the United Kingdom]]''
[[Image:Heathrow Visitor Centre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Heathrow Airport]] is the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|world's busiest airport in terms of numbers of international passengers]].]]
There are 471 [[airport]]s in the UK, of which 334 are [[paved]]. There are also 11 [[heliport]]s. ''(2004 [[CIA World Factbook|CIA]] estimates)''

[[BAA plc|BAA]] runs many of the UK's airports, its flagship being [[London Heathrow Airport]], the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|busiest airport in the world in terms of number of international passengers]], and [[London Gatwick Airport]], the second largest.   The third largest is [[Manchester Airport]], in [[Manchester]], which is run by [[Manchester Airport Group]], which also owns various other airports.

Other major airports include [[London Stansted Airport]] in [[Essex, England|Essex]], about thirty miles (50&nbsp;km) north of London and [[Birmingham, UK International Airport|Birmingham International Airport]], in [[Birmingham]].

Outside of England, [[Cardiff International Airport]], [[Glasgow International Airport]] and [[Belfast International Airport]], are the busiest airports serving [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] respectively.

The largest airline in the UK is [[British Airways]], who operate long-distance flights from the UK to all over the globe.  Others include [[Bmi (airline)|bmi]], [[Easyjet]], and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]].

==Administrative subdivisions==
{{main|Subdivisions of the United Kingdom}}

The United Kingdom is divided into four ''[[home nations]]'' or ''[[constituent country|constituent countries]]''. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each have a parliament or assembly and a devolved executive (the arrangements in Northern Ireland are currently suspended).  England has no "national" parliament or government (it is ruled directly by the UK government).

Each nation is further subdivided for the purposes of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]]. The Queen appoints a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] as her personal representative in lieutenancy areas across the {{abbr|UK}}; this is little more than a ceremonial role. The following table highlights the arrangements for local government, lieutenancy areas and cities across the home nations of the {{abbr|UK}}:

Historically, the four nations were divided into [[Traditional counties of the British Isles|counties]] as areas for local government administration. Although these are still used to some extent for this purpose and as geographical areas, they are no longer the sole basis for [[local]] government administration.

In recent years, England has, for some purposes, been divided into nine intermediate-level [[Regions of England|Government Office Regions]]. Each region is made up of [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|counties]] and [[unitary authorities]], apart from [[London]], which consists of [[London borough]]s. Although at one point it was intended that each or some of these regions would be given its own elected regional assembly, the plan's future is uncertain following a rejection, by referendum, of a proposed assembly in the [[North East England|North East]] region.

[[City status in the United Kingdom|City status]] is governed by [[Royal Charter]]. There are 66 British cities (50 in England; 6 in Scotland; 5 in Wales; and 5 in Northern Ireland). 

The [[British crown|Crown]] has sovereignty over the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], and the [[Isle of Man]] - known collectively as the [[crown dependencies]]. These are lands historically owned by the [[British monarch]] but are not part of the United Kingdom itself. They are also not in the European Union. However, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the authority to legislate for the dependencies, and the British government manages their foreign affairs and defence. 

The {{abbr|UK}} also has fourteen [[British overseas territory|overseas territories]] around the world, the last remaining territories of the [[British Empire]]. The overseas territories are also not considered part of the {{abbr|UK}}, but in most cases the local populations have British citizenship and the right to abode in the {{abbr|UK}}. This has been the case since 2002.

==Military==
{{main|British Armed Forces}}

[[Image:2006 CVF STOVL.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Royal Navy]]'s [[CVF Aircraft Carriers]] with [[F-35]] fighter jets replacement for the Invincible class aircraft carriers fleet and [[Sea Harriers]].]]

The Army, Navy and Air force are collectively known as the [[armed force]]s and are also known as the '''British Armed Forces''' or '''Her Majesty's Armed Forces''', but officially '''Armed Forces of the Crown'''. Their [[Commander-in-Chief]] is the monarch, [[Elizabeth II]] and they are managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. The armed forces are controlled by the [[Defence Council]] currently headed by [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Jock Stirrup|Sir Jock Stirrup]].

The United Kingdom fields one of the most powerful, efficient and comprehensive armed forces in the world. Its global [[power projection]] capabilities are deemed second only to the [[United States military]], and its navy is the world's second strongest. <ref>{{cite web|title=Sea Vision UK|work = Why is the maritime sector so important?|publisher=[[Sea Vision UK]]|date=2006|url = http://www.seavisionuk.org/maritime_sector.htm|accessdate = 2006-11-16}}</ref> Furthermore, amongst the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] allies the Royal Navy's total naval tonnage is second only to the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] and has the third largest share of tactical combat aircraft to the [[US Air Force|US]] and [[Military of France|France]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter II: REGIONAL OVERVIEW AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF KEY ALLIES: Contributions of Selected NATO Allies|work = Allied Contributions to the Common Defense: A Report to the United States Congress by the Secretary of Defense|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|date=March 2001|url =  http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/allied_contrib2001/Allied2001-Chap2.html|accessdate = 2006-10-14}}</ref><!--If anyone has a more recent source, please insert!--> According to the British Ministry of Defence, the {{abbr|UK}} has the second highest [[military expenditure]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title = About Defence: Defence Spending|date=2006-12-07|url =  http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/Organisation/KeyFactsAboutDefence/DefenceSpending.htm}}</ref>

The United Kingdom possesses a comprehensive nuclear arsenal (one of the [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|small number of countries]] to do so), utilising the submarine-based [[Trident missile|Trident II]] ballistic missile system with nuclear warheads. These [[Vanguard class submarine]]s were designed and built by [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd|VSEL]] (now [[BAE Systems Submarines]]) at [[Barrow-in-Furness]].

The British Armed Forces are charged with protecting the United Kingdom and its overseas territories, promoting the United Kingdom's wider security interests, and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and other coalition operations.

[[Image:Trident II missile image.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Royal Navy]] operates four nuclear [[Vanguard class]] submarines armed with the [[Trident II]] nuclear missiles.]]

The [[British Army]] had a reported strength of 102,440 in 2005 <ref>"[http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/6FBA7459-7407-4B85-AA47-7063F1F22461/0/modara_0405_s1_resources.pdf Annual Reports and Accounts 2004-05]", Ministry of Defence. Retrieved 14 May 2006. {{PDFlink}}</ref> and the [[Royal Air Force]] a strength of 49,210. The 36,320-member [[Royal Navy]] operates the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent, which consists of four [[Trident missile]]-armed submarines, while the [[Royal Marines]] are the Royal Navy's [[Light Infantry]] units for [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] operations and for specialist reinforcement forces in and beyond the [[NATO]] area. This puts total active duty military personnel in the range of 190,000 deployed in over 80 countries. 

There are also reserve forces supporting the regular military. These include an army reserve, the [[Territorial Army]] (TA), the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), [[Royal Marines Reserve]] (RMR) and the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] (RAuxAF). About 9% of the regular armed forces is made up of women, a figure that is higher for the reserve forces.

The [[United Kingdom Special Forces]], principally the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) and [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS), but including others, provide troops trained for quick, mobile, military responses in [[counter-terrorism]], land, maritime and [[amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]], often where secrecy or covert operations are required. 

Despite the United Kingdom's wide-ranging capabilities, recent pragmatic defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" would be undertaken as part of a coalition. <ref>Office for National Statistics "{{abbr|UK}} 2005: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" p. 89 </ref> [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[2001 war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] (Operations [[Operation Veritas|VERITAS]], [[Operation Fingal|FINGAL]] and [[Operation Herrick|HERRICK]]), [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] (Ops [[Operation Granby|GRANBY]], [[Operation Desert Fox|DESERT FOX]], [[Operation Telic|TELIC]] and the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zones]]) may all be taken as precedent; the last war in which the British military fought alone was the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, with full-scale combat operations lasting almost three months.

=== Literature ===
{{main|British literature}}

[[Image:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|The [[Chandos portrait]], believed to depict [[William Shakespeare]], famed playwright]]

The countries that make up the United Kingdom have provided some of the world's most notable and popular authors, poets and literary figures. The English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the [[English language]].<ref> [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109536 Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shakespeare], [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562101/Shakespeare.html MSN Encarta Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare], [http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/Shakespeare,+William Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare]. Accessed Feb. 26, 2006.</ref>

Many world-famous writers and poets lived and wrote in the United Kingdom. England is particularly well represented in the history of the [[novel]]. Early English writers who could be described as novelists include [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[Sir Thomas Malory|Thomas Malory]] and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. These romantic writers were followed by a wave of more realistic writers in later centuries, including [[Jane Austen]] (often credited with inventing the modern novel), [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], [[Charles Dickens]], the [[Brontë|Brontë sisters]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[Anthony Trollope]]. In the 20th century, [[H. G. Wells]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[EM Forster]], [[George Orwell]] and [[Graham Greene]]  made contributions.  More recently [[Ian McEwan]] , [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Martin Amis]] and [[Zadie Smith]]  were amongst those gaining recognition, while childrens' author [[J. K. Rowling]] has had immense recent popularity.

Wales and Scotland have also contributed many notable writers to the UK's stock of great literature, particularly in poetry. In the early medieval period, Welsh writers composed the famous [[Mabinogion]]. In modern times, the poets [[R.S. Thomas]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] have brought Welsh culture and ideas to a world audience. In Romantic literature, Scotland offers [[Sir Walter Scott]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s epic adventures and the leading poet of his day, [[Robert Burns]]. Modern Scottish writers like [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and [[Neil M. Gunn]] helped develop a distinct modernist and nationalist Scottish voice, sometimes termed the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. A more grim outlook is found in [[Ian Rankin]]'s stories and the psychological horror-comedy of [[Iain Banks]].

Many authors from other nationalities, particularly the Irish, and from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, have also lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include [[Jonathon Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and  [[Joseph Conrad]], and  more recently British authors of overseas origin such as [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] and [[Salman Rushdie]].

Important poets include [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Milton]], [[William Blake]], [[Robert Burns]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[John Keats]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[R. S. Thomas]], [[Wilfred Owen]], [[John Betjeman]], [[Philip Larkin]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Ted Hughes]].

The history of the [[theatre]] in the United Kingdom is particularly vivid. Shakespeare's contemporaries [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]] add depth to the early theatre. More recently [[Alan Ayckbourn]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Michael Frayn]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism ;  with successful recent playwrights also including [[John Osborne]], [[Arnold Wesker]], [[Alan Bennett]] and  [[David Hare]].

===Engineering and innovation===
{{seealso|Category:British inventors|Category:British inventions}}

As birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the UK was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th century. Famous British engineers include [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], best known for the creation of the [[Great Western Railway]], a series of famous [[steamship]]s, and numerous important [[bridge]]s. 

Recent British inventors include [[James Dyson]], inventor of the [[DC01|Dual Cyclone]] bagless [[vacuum cleaner]].

As above, notable engineering firsts include the steam locomotive and the modern railway, [[television]], [[electric lighting]], the [[electric motor]], the [[screw propeller]], the [[internal combustion engine]], the [[jet engine]]. Two notable innovations are [[vaccination]] and [[antibiotics]].

<!--
Other notable figures in the fields of engineering and innovation include:

*[[Tim Berners-Lee]] (inventor of the [[world wide web]])
*[[James Blundell (physician)|James Blundell]] (performed the first [[blood transfusion]])

=== Cinema ===

{{main|Cinema of the United Kingdom}}

The United Kingdom has been influential in the development of cinema, with the [[Ealing Studios]] claiming to be the oldest studios in the world. Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry is characterised by an ongoing debate about its identity, and the influences of American and European cinema. Famous films include the [[Harry Potter]], [[Star Wars]] and [[James Bond]] series which, although made by American studios, used British source materials, locations, actors and filming crew.

=== Design and architecture ===
{{main|Architecture of the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:London Eye Twilight April 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[British Airways]] [[London Eye]].]]

The United Kingdom has produced a number of important architects, including  Sir [[Christopher Wren]], and [[Sir Norman Foster]] along with designers [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and [[Jonathan Ive]]. 

=== Music ===
{{main|British Music}}

Notable composers from the United Kingdom have included [[Henry Purcell]], [[Sir Edward Elgar]], [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] (most famous for working with librettist [[Sir W. S. Gilbert]]), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and Lord [[Benjamin Britten]] who pioneered British [[opera]], while London remains one of the major [[classical music]] capitals of the world.

The {{abbr|UK}} was, with the US, one of the two main contributors in the development of [[rock and roll]], and the {{abbr|UK}} has provided some of the world's most famous rock bands including [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]],  [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Deep Purple]],  [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Who]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Cure]], [[The Jam]], [[Iron Maiden]] and Judas Priest.

The {{abbr|UK}} has also been at the forefront of a succession of developments of rock, including   [[punk rock]], with bands like   [[The Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]], as well as  Goth and Rave  youth culture, folk rock, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]  and [[progressive rock]]. The late-1970s and 1980s saw the rise of [[Post-Punk]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]]. The so-called 'Second British Invasion' into the US popular music scene took place from 1982 to 1984 when {{abbr|UK}} bands flooded the US Billboard charts. In the mid to late-1990s, the [[Britpop]] phenomenon saw bands such as [[Radiohead]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and  [[Blur (band)|Blur]] attain considerable national and international success. The 1990s also saw the rise of major Welsh bands such as [[The Stereophonics]] and [[Manic Street Preachers]].

The {{abbr|UK}} has also at the forefront of [[electronica]], with British artists such as [[The Prodigy]] and [[The Chemical Brothers]] helping this mainly underground genre to cross over into the mainstream (having originated in the early-90's with techno bands such as [[Orbital]]). British pop producers [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] dominated the charts in the late-80s and early-90s with their instantly recognisable brand of pop.

The 1990s charts were also dominated by the [[boy band]] phenomenon, with groups such as [[Take That]] thriving amongst countless others. Girl groups like the [[Spice Girls ]] and [[Sugababes]] also found considerable success. In the 2000s [[Pop]] came back again with new singers such as [[Sophie Ellis Bextor]] and [[Lily Allen]].

[[UK Garage]] developed out of the urban music scene towards the end of the decade, through acts such as the [[Artful Dodger]]. The popularity of '[[soft rock]]' bands such as [[Coldplay]] has increased, whilst [[Indie (music)|indie music]] has grown in profile, with bands such as [[The Libertines]] and [[Arctic Monkeys]] enjoying chart success and [[Pete Doherty]] gaining newspaper headlines. '[[Reality-TV]]' has also produced a new generation of 'popstars', some of whom such as [[Will Young]] and the girlband, [[Girls Aloud]], have gone on to successful careers.

=== Media ===
{{main|Media of the United Kingdom}}

The {{abbr|UK}} has a virtually unrivaled number of media outlets, and the prominence of the English language gives it a widespread [[international]] dimension. 

The [[BBC]] is the {{abbr|UK}}'s publicly-funded [[radio]] and [[television]] broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest broadcaster in the world. Funded by the compulsory [[television licence]], the BBC operates several [[BBC Television|television networks]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] stations both in the {{abbr|UK}} and abroad. The BBC's international television news service, [[BBC World]], is broadcast throughout the world and the [[BBC World Service]] radio network is broadcast in 33 languages globally. The major television networks in the {{abbr|UK}} are [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV]], [[Channel 4]], [[Five (TV)|Five]] and [[BSkyB]].  The vast majority of digital [[Cable television|cable]] services are provided by [[NTL|NTL:Telewest]] (created by the merger of NTL and Telewest in March 2006), and [[free-to-air]] digital terrestrial television by [[Freeview]]. 

[[Radio in the United Kingdom|Radio in the {{abbr|UK}}]] is dominated by [[BBC Radio]], which operates 10 national networks and over 40 local radio stations. The most popular radio station, by number of listeners, is [[BBC Radio 2]], closely followed by [[BBC Radio 1]].  There are also hundreds of commercial radio stations which are largely local-based offering up a variety of music or talk formats.

Traditionally, [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspapers]] could be split into "quality", serious-minded newspaper (usually referred to as ''[[broadsheets]]'' because of their large size) and the more populist, tabloid varieties. For convenience of reading, many traditional broadsheets have switched to a '[[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]-sized' format, traditionally used by [[tabloid]]s. [[The Sun (newspaper)|''The Sun'']] has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper in the {{abbr|UK}}, with approximately a quarter of the market; its sister paper, ''[[The News of The World]]'' similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market <ref> [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,1782,00.html ABC Newspaper Circulation Figures] ''[[The Times]]'', [[May 12]] 2006, accessed May 16 2006.</ref>, and traditionally focuses on celebrity-led stories. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a [[Right-wing politics|right-of-centre]] paper, is the highest selling of the 'qualities' (former broadsheets), having overtaken ''[[The Times]]'' in circulation figures.

''[[The Guardian]]'' is a more [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|liberal]] or left-wing former broadsheet. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' is the main business paper, printed on distinctive salmon-pink broadsheet paper. Scotland has a distinct tradition of newspaper readership. {{see|List of newspapers in Scotland}}

===Sport===
{{main|Sport in the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|right|thumb|The [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Championships [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament is held in London every July.]]

A number of major [[sport]]s originated in the United Kingdom, including [[association football]] (football, or soccer), [[rugby football]] (rugby), [[golf]], [[cricket]] and [[boxing]].

The most popular sport in the {{abbr|UK}} is [[Football (soccer)|association football]] (known as soccer in any country with its own native football game), commonly referred to as just "football". The {{abbr|UK}} does not compete as a nation in any major football tournament. Instead, the home nations compete individually as [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. It is because of this four-team arrangement that the {{abbr|UK}} does not compete in football events at the [[Olympic Games]]. However, there is talk of a united team taking part in the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]], which are to be held in London. The English and Northern Irish football associations have confirmed participation in this team while the [[Scottish FA]] and the [[Welsh FA]] have declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent status.

The {{abbr|UK}} is home to many world-renowned football clubs, such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in England, and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in Scotland. Clubs compete in [[Football in the United Kingdom|national leagues and competitions]] and some go on to compete in European competitions. British teams are generally successful in European Competitions and several have become European Cup/UEFA Champions League winners: [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (five times), [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (twice), [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (twice), [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. The [[English Premier League]] is also the most-watched football league in the world<ref>http://www.footy-live.com/Premiership.html</ref> and is particularly popular in [[Asia]]: in the [[People's Republic of China]], matches attract television audiences between 100 million and 360 million, more than any other foreign sport.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3207829.stm | title = Chinese phone maker's fancy footwork | publisher = BBC News | date = [[27 October]] [[2003]]| accessdate = 2006-08-09 }}</ref>

[[Image:NewWembleyBuild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wembley Stadium]] when completed will be the largest football stadium in the World.]]

The early reference to the separate national identities in the UK is perhaps best illustrated by the game of cricket.  [[Cricket]] was invented in [[England]]. There are league championships but the [[England|English]] national team dominates the game in Britain. There is no UK team.  Although some [[Welsh]] and [[Scottish]] players have played for [[England]], it is in [[England]] where cricket retains its major fan base in the UK. [[England|English]] [[cricket]] grounds include Lords, The Brit Oval, Headingly, Old Trafford, Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. However Cardiff's [[Sophia Gardens]] ground has become increasingly popular in recent years.

The {{abbr|UK}} has proved successful in the international sporting arena in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. It is widely considered that the sport's most successful rower is [[Steven Redgrave]] who won five gold medals and one bronze medal at five consecutive [[Olympic Games]] as well as numerous wins at the [[World Rowing Championships]] and [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

Both forms of rugby are national sports. [[Rugby league]] originates from and is generally played in the North of England, whilst [[Rugby Union]] is played predominantly in [[Wales]], [[Ireland]] and [[Southern England]]. Having supposedly originated from the actions of [[William Webb Ellis]] at the town of [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], it is considered the national sport of Wales. In [[rugby league]] the {{abbr|UK}} plays as one nation &ndash; [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] &ndash; though in union it is represented by four nations: England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (which consists of players from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and Northern Ireland). [[England national rugby union team|England]] is the holder of the [[Rugby World Cup]]. Every four years the [[British and Irish Lions]] tour either Australia, New Zealand or South Africa.  Here, rugby football differs internationally to association football, as the England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) teams do come together to form the [[British and Irish Lions]], though they do all compete separately internationally for the most part.

The [[Wimbledon Championships]] are international [[tennis]] events held in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in south London every summer and are seen as the most prestigious of the tennis calendar.
[[Image:Royal & Ancient Clubhouse.jpg|thumb|[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] regarded as the worldwide "Home of Golf".]]
[[Thoroughbred racing]] is also very popular in England. It originated under [[Charles II of England]] as the "Sport of Kings" and is a royal pastime to this day. World-famous horse races include the [[Grand National]], the [[Epsom Derby]] and [[Royal Ascot]].

Golf is one of the most popular participation sports played in the {{abbr|UK}}, with [[St Andrews]] in Scotland being the sport's home course. Cricket is also popular, although the popularity of the game is dramatically greater in England than in other parts of the {{abbr|UK}}, all four constituent nations [[as of 2006]] compete at the One-Day International level &ndash; Scotland independently, Wales as part of the English team, and Northern Ireland as part of All-Ireland.

[[Shinty|Shinty or camanachd]] (a sport derived from the same root as the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[hurling]] and similar to [[bandy]]) is popular in the [[Scottish Highlands]], sometimes attracting crowds numbering thousands in the most sparsely populated region of the {{abbr|UK}}.

The country is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] and the [[World Rally Championship]] are based in the {{abbr|UK}}. The country also hosts legs of the F1 and World Rallying Championship calendars and has its own [[Touring Car Racing]] championship, the [[BTCC]].

British [[Formula One World Championship|Formula One World Champions]] include [[Mike Hawthorn]], [[Graham Hill]] (twice), [[Jim Clark]] (twice), [[John Surtees]] (who was also world champion in motorcycling), [[Jackie Stewart]] (three times), [[James Hunt]], [[Nigel Mansell]], and Graham Hill's son, [[Damon Hill]]. British drivers have not been as successful in the World Rally Championship, with only [[Colin McRae]] and the late [[Richard Burns]] winning the title.

* The [[national anthem]] of the {{abbr|UK}} is "[[God Save the King]]" but as the Monarch changes from male to female the song that complements God Save the King is changed to God Save the Queen. The anthem name remains God Save the King.<ref>It is sometimes asserted by those used to a legislative tradition that "God Save the Queen" is not the actual national anthem of the {{abbr|UK}}, (or sometimes that it is the ''de facto'' national anthem) because no law has ever been passed to say that that is the case. In the {{abbr|UK}}, however, such laws are unnecessary; custom, practice and proclamation are sufficient to establish it as the official national anthem.</ref>

* [[Britannia]] is a [[national personification|personification]] of the {{abbr|UK}}, originating from the [[Roman occupation of Britannia|Roman occupation]] of southern and central Great Britain<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdate=2006-06-25}}</ref>. Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or [[golden]] hair, wearing a [[Corinthian]] helmet and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a [[shield]], bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding the back of a lion. In modern usage, Britannia is often associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song ''[[Rule Britannia]]''.
[[Image:Proof-gold-britannia.jpg|thumb|240|Britannia, featured on [[Royal Mint]] gold bullion coin]]

* The [[lion]] has also been used as a symbol of the {{abbr|UK}}; one is depicted behind Britannia on the [[50p|50 pence]] piece and one is shown crowned on the back of the [[10p|10 pence]] piece. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the [[British Army]]. Lions have been used as [[heraldic device]]s many times, including in the royal arms of both the kingdoms of [[Coat of Arms of England|England]], [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in [[Wales]]. The lion is featured on the emblem of the [[England national football team]], giving rise to the popular football anthem ''[[Three Lions]]'', and the [[England national cricket team]].

* The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of [[Great Britain]], and is often associated with [[Winston Churchill]]'s defiance of Nazi Germany.

* Britain (especially England) is also personified as the character [[John Bull]].

* The ancient British landscape, and especially some of its distinctive fauna such as the [[oak]] tree and the [[rose]], have long been a widely-used proxy for the visual representation of British identity. The red rose is the emblem of the [[England national rugby union team]] and the [[RFU]]
