'''Sir Alfred Patrick Caldwell-Moore''', [[Commander of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society|HonFRS]], [[Royal Astronomical Society|FRAS]] (born [[4 March]] [[1923]] in [[Pinner]]) known as '''Patrick Moore''', is an [[England|English]] [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomer]] who has attained legendary status in astronomy as a writer, researcher, radio commentator and television presenter of the subject and who is credited as having done more than any other to raise the profile of astronomy among the British general public. He was born to Captain Charles Trachsel Caldwell-Moore [[Military Cross|MC]] (died 1947) and Gertrude, née White (died 1981 aged 94). 

Sir Patrick was always very close to his mother and she was a talented artist who lived with him at his [[Selsey]] home which is still colourfully decorated with many paintings of "bogeys", little friendly aliens, which she regularly produced and were sent out annually as Patrick's Christmas cards.

He is a former president of the [[British Astronomical Association]], co-founder and former president of the [[Society for Popular Astronomy]], author of over 70 books on astronomy, presenter of the longest running television series (with the same original presenter), ''[[The Sky at Night]]'' on the [[BBC]] and a famous figure on British television (such as being the [[Gamesmaster]]). He is well known for his rapid mode of speech, trademark [[monocle]], poorly fitting blazers, extremely high trouser line and a fondness for the [[xylophone]]. 

Sir Patrick is also an accomplished composer. He is entirely self-taught in music. His favourite style includes 19th century Viennese waltzes and marches, but he has also turned to ragtime, polkas, and a nocturne. In 1981 he played a xylophone solo in a [[Royal]] Command Performance.

== Early life ==

Sir Patrick Moore was born in [[Pinner]] in [[Middlesex]] and moved to [[East Grinstead]] in [[Sussex]], where he spent his childhood. His youth was marked by poor health and consequently he was educated at home by private tutors. He developed an interest in [[astronomy]] at the age of six and was elected to the [[British Astronomical Association]] at the age of 11. In the [[Second World War]] Moore lied about his age in order to join the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and from 1940 until 1945 he served as a navigator in [[RAF Bomber Command]], reaching the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]], having received his flight training in Canada where he met [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Orville Wright]] whilst on leave in New York. The war had a significant influence on his life: his only known romance ended when his fiancée, a nurse, was killed by a bomb which fell on her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked, somewhat poignantly, that he never married because "There was no one else for me... second best is no good for me...I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23380963-details/Why+Patrick+Moore+is+married+to+the+moon/article.do |title=Why Patrick Moore is married to the moon |accessdate=2007-04-03 |format= |work=This is London article}}</ref>

After the war, Moore eventually set up home at [[Selsey]] in [[Sussex]], where he constructed a home-made [[reflecting telescope]] in his garden and began to observe the [[Moon]]. He was fascinated by the subject and he is now acknowledged as a specialist in lunar observation, one of his particular areas of expertise being the study of the glimpses of the Moon's [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] that are occasionally visible due to the Moon's [[libration]]. He was also an early observer of [[Transient lunar phenomena]]: short-lived glowing areas on the lunar surface.

== Television ==
On [[26 April]] [[1957]], at 10:30 pm, in an event that was to be a landmark of his career, Moore presented the first episode of ''The Sky at Night'', a BBC television programme for astronomy enthusiasts. Since then, he has presented every episode each month, excepting July 2004, because of a near-fatal bout of [[food poisoning]] caused by eating a contaminated [[goose egg]]. Moore appears in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the longest-serving TV presenter, by virtue of having presented the show since 1957. Early editions of ''The Sky at Night'' were transmitted live and on one occasion he swallowed a [[fly]] live on air. Since 2004, the programme has been presented from Moore's home, as he is no longer able to travel to the studios, owing to [[arthritis]]. 

On [[1 April]] [[2007]], a 50th anniversary semi-spoof edition of the programme was broadcast on BBC1, with Moore depicted as a [[Time lord]] and featuring, as special guests, amateur astronomers [[Jon Culshaw]] (impersonating Moore presenting the very first [[The Sky At Night]]) and Dr [[Brian May]]. This tongue-in-cheek edition of the show included a look-ahead to the state of astronomy in the year 2057, with May recalling his appearance in a disastrous concert on the [[Moon]], in which an accident resulted in an explosion of rocket fuel that sent [[Queen (band)|Queen]] drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen)|Roger Taylor]] into [[orbit]], with accompanying footage of Taylor orbiting the moon, [[drumsticks]] still in hand. During the programme, Moore tries in vain to warn his past self to avoid the goose egg that gave him food poisoning in 2004 and expresses annoyance at the late time slot that the show occupies. 

On [[6 May]] [[2007]], a special edition of ''The Sky at Night'' was broadcast on BBC1, to commemorate the programme's 50th anniversary, with a party in Moore's garden at [[Selsey]], attended by amateur and professional astronomers. It consisted of a retrospective of highlights from the past 654 editions of the programme, together with Moore reminiscing with guests who have appeared over the past 50 years and who have been influenced in various ways by the programme and by Moore himself. Another special edition, broadcast on BBC4 on [[9 December]] [[2007]], was a retrospective of achievements in astronomical science during the past 50 years, together with a review of the highlights of "The Sky at Night" in presenting such achievements and the contributions of distinguished astronomers to the programme during those years.  

Patrick Moore has undertaken significant research in astronomy. It was revealed in a TV programme that when the Russians wanted accurate information on the Moon over a number of years, they first went to America then other countries for the information but could not obtain such information. Patrick Moore was then suggested as a source of the data and on visiting him at this dwelling, they were invited in.  Moore left them and returned with a pile of exercise books with all the necessary information in, his records of observations over many years which is how in 1959, the [[Soviet Union]] used his charts of the moon to correlate their first pictures of the far side with his mapped features on the near side and he was involved in the lunar mapping used by the [[NASA]] [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] [[Manned space mission|space missions]]. In 1965, he was appointed Director of the newly-constructed [[Armagh Planetarium]], a post he held until 1968. During the Apollo programme, Moore was a presenter of the [[British television Apollo 11 coverage|BBC's television's coverage of the moon landing]] missions. He compiled the [[Caldwell catalog]]ue of astronomical objects and in 1982 [[asteroid]] [[2602 Moore]] was named in his honour. 

Moore has written over 70 books on astronomy, all of them typed on a Woodstock typewriter of 1908 vintage, which he has always preferred to any more modern device. After the BBC withdrew financial support, he independently produced a 50th anniversary DVD of his life and work titled 'The Astronomical Patrick Moore'.

On [[7 March]] [[2006]], he was hospitalized and fitted with a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] because of a cardiac abnormality.

=== Honours and appointments ===
In 1945, Moore was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. In 1968, he was appointed OBE and promoted to CBE in 1988. In 2001, he was [[knighthood|knighted]] "for services to the popularisation of science and to broadcasting". In the same year, he was appointed an [[Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society]]. In June 2002, he was appointed as Hon. Vice President of the Society for the History of Astronomy. He has also won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for services to television.

During a podcast of the [[Ricky Gervais Show]] in 2006, he was chosen by [[Karl Pilkington]] as one of six people who ought to re-start and educate human life on an imaginary uninhabited planet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBDDlE_k0kM |title=Brand New Ricky Gervais podcast |accessdate=2008-02-17 |format=Flash |work=YouTube}}</ref>

A keen amateur [[chess]] player, Moore often carries a pocket set around with him and has been honoured with the title of Vice President of Sussex Junior Chess Association.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icu.ie/articles/display.php?id=123 |title=Sussex v. Ireland Junior Match 2002 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=Herbert Scarry |work=The Irish Chess Union}}</ref> In 2003, he presented Sussex Junior [[David Howell (chess player)|David Howell]] with the best young chess player award on [[Carlton TV]]'s ''Britain's Brilliant Prodigies'' show.

=== Other interests and popular culture ===
Aside from presenting ''The Sky at Night'' show, Moore has appeared in a number of other television and radio shows, including, from 1992 until 1998, playing the role of [[Gamesmaster]] in the television show of the same name: a character who professed to know everything there is to know about video gaming. He would issue video game challenges and answer questions on cheats and tips presented in the Consoletation Zone. His appearance differed depending on the show's season (eg. in Season 1, he was an artificial intelligence whereas in Season 5, set in Heaven, he looked like a god). 

He also appeared in self-parodying roles, in several episodes of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' and on the [[Morecambe and Wise]] show. He had a minor role in the fourth radio series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and featured in the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] sci-fi parody, [[Independence Day UK]]. He also appeared in [[It's a Celebrity Knockout]], [[Blankety Blank]] and [[Face the Music]].  He has appeared on television at least once in a film prop [[spacesuit]]. Despite believing that there may well be life in other parts of the universe, he has stated that he believes that there has not been any real contact with [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s and he dismisses all theories of the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs.

Until being forced to give up owing to [[arthritis]], Moore was a keen [[musician]] and accomplished [[xylophone]] player. He has composed a substantial corpus of works, including two [[operetta]]s. He occasionally performed novelty turns at the [[Royal Variety Performance]] and appeared in a song-and-dance act in the 1971 [[Morecambe and Wise]] Christmas special. As a guest on ''[[Have I Got News For You]],'' he accompanied the show's closing theme tune on the xylophone and as a pianist, he once accompanied [[Albert Einstein]] playing [[Le Cygne (Saint-Saëns)|The Swan]] by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] on the violin (of which no recording was made). Moore is listed by the [[Internet Movie Database]] as the uncredited musical consultant on the 1968 [[Stanley Kubrick]]/[[Arthur C Clarke]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Patrick Moore was also the subject of a popular internet cartoon entitled "[http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/patrick+moore/ Patrick Moore Plays the Xylophone]", which appears on [[Weebl's Stuff]].

He is a friend of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist and astrophysicist Dr [[Brian May]], who himself is a sometime guest on [[The Sky At Night]]. The pair have co-authored a book with [[Chris Lintott]], entitled ''Bang! The Complete History of the Universe''.

His books are mostly [[non-fiction]] dealing with astronomy, along with several [[science fiction]] [[novel]]s. His first novels were a series about the first arrivals on [[Mars]], including [[Mission to Mars (novel)]] and [[The Voices of Mars (novel)]], followed in 1977 by the start of the ''Scott Saunders Space Adventure'' series, aimed primarily at a younger audience, which eventually ran to six novels. In 1983 he published ''Bureaucrats: How to Annoy Them'' under the [[pseudonym]] R. T. Fishall.

In January 1998, part of Moore's [[observatory]] at his home in Selsey was destroyed by a [[tornado]] which passed through the area. The observatory was subsequently rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/45580.stm |title=Town picks up the pieces after tornado |accessdate=2007-04-03 |format= |work=BBC News website}}</ref>

Along with many other celebrities, Patrick Moore has been the subject of crank-calls by [[comedian]] [[Jon Culshaw]], as part of the [[BBC Radio 4]] show [[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]. On this occasion, Jon Culshaw impersonated [[Tom Baker]]'s role of the [[Fourth Doctor]] ([[Doctor Who]]), supposedly consulting Moore on various astronomy-related matters. Moore, being aware of what was going on, confused Culshaw by out-playing him in his use of [[technobabble]], resulting in a rare pause from the comedian as he tried to think of a response.

=== Activism ===
Moore is noted for his [[conservatism|conservative]] political views. In the 1970s, he was Chairman of the anti-immigration [[United Country Party]], a position he held until the party was absorbed by the [[New Britain Party]] in 1980. He then joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and later the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]], becoming a long standing supporter and patron of the [[euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukipdorset.org/patron.htm |title=UKIP Dorset Party Patrons Page |accessdate=2007-05-08 }}</ref> Moore introduced the DVD 'Britain on the Brink', a documentary which, he asserted, exposed the 'truth' that had been hidden from British people about being a member state in the [[European Union]]. He opposes the [[Iraq War]], stating: <blockquote>Mr. Bush’s venture into Iraq could have instead paid for the entire [[NASA| space program]] for quite a few years... I think Bush is certifiable. He’s a danger. If we are not careful he’ll plunge the world into a Third World War. He’s power-drunk you see. If he goes for [[Iran]] or [[North Korea]], big trouble! What’s the difference between [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Saddam Hussein]]? Mugabe doesn’t produce oil!<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b3ta.com/interview/patrickmoore/ |title=Interviews: Patrick Moore |accessdate=2007-08-11 |work=[[b3ta]]}}</ref></blockquote>

He is an opponent of [[fox hunting]] and all blood sports. He has been a lifelong animal lover, actively supporting many animal welfare charities. He has a particular affinity for cats and has two of them.

== Personal life ==
Because of his long-running television career and eccentric demeanour, Moore is widely recognised and has become a popular public figure, even to people with no interest in astronomy. In 1976, this was used to good effect for an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool]]'s spoof on [[BBC Radio 2]], when Moore announced that at 9.47 am, a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event was going to occur: [[Pluto]] would pass behind Jupiter, temporarily causing a [[Jovian-Plutonian gravitational effect|gravitational alignment]] which would reduce the Earth's own [[gravity]]. Moore informed listeners that if they could jump at the exact moment that this event occurred, they would experience a temporary floating sensation. The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging that they actually experienced the sensation. 

Moore joined the [[Flat Earth Society]] as an ironic joke, though some have taken this seriously.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/SciRefGuides/flatearth.html |title=The Flat Earth and its Advocates: A List of References |accessdate=2007-04-03 |format= |work=[[Library of Congress]] Science Reference Guides}}</ref>

In May 2007, Moore provocatively asserted that the BBC was being "ruined by women", commenting that: <blockquote> "The trouble is that the BBC now is run by women and it shows: soap operas, cooking, quizzes, kitchen-sink plays. You wouldn’t have had that in the golden days.” </blockquote>

In response, a BBC spokeswoman described Moore as being one of TV's best-loved figures and remarked that his "forthright" views were "what we all love about him".  <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1760061.ece The BBC is being ruined by women, says Patrick Moore], Adam Sherwin, Times Online, [[8 May]] [[2007]].</ref>
