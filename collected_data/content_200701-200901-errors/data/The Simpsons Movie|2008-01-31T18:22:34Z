'''''The Simpsons Movie''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[animation|animated]] [[comedy film]] based on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. The film was directed by [[David Silverman]], and stars the regular television cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Pamela Hayden]]. It features [[Albert Brooks]] as Russ Cargill, the evil head of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] who intends to destroy [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] after [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] polluted the lake. Because the townspeople exile him and his [[Simpsons family|family]] abandon him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Cargill's scheme.

Previous attempts to create a film version of ''The Simpsons'' had failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually, producers [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Scully]], and [[Richard Sakai]] began development of the film in 2001. A writing team consisting of Scully, Jean, Brooks, Groening, [[George Meyer]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Jon Vitti]], [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]] and [[Matt Selman]] was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this creativity continued after animation had begun in 2006. This meant hours of finished material was cut, which included [[Cameo appearance|cameo roles]] from [[Isla Fisher]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Erin Brockovich]], [[Edward Norton]] and [[Kelsey Grammer]]. [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Green Day]] appeared in the final cut as themselves.

Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including [[Burger King]] and [[7-Eleven]], which [[Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed selected stores]] into [[Kwik-E-Mart|Kwik-E-Marts]]. The film premiered in [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Vermont]], which had won the right to hold it through a competition organized by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. The film was a box office success, grossing over [[US$]]526 million. It received a significant majority of positive reviews, with some critics saying it was better than the latter seasons of the show.

==Plot==
<!--If you do not want spoilers, then do not read this section. Please keep plot to this length, no spoiler tags. It is a basic over view of the film, not a blow by blow description of jokes.-->
While [[rock music|rock]] band [[Green Day]] are performing on Lake Springfield, the band members fail to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge, causing it to sink. At a memorial service, [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] has a [[prophecy|prophetic]] vision, in which he predicts the impending doom of the town, but only [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes it seriously. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and an Irish boy named [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Colin]], whom she has fallen in love with, hold a seminar where they convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] adopts a pig, which causes his now neglected son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to look to their neighbor, [[Ned Flanders]], as a parental figure. 

Homer stores the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge, and she tells him to dispose of it safely. However, Homer gets distracted and instead dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Nearby, Flanders and Bart discover the squirrel during a hike, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] captures it. [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, presents five options to [[President of the United States|President]] [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Schwarzenegger]], who randomly picks the action of enclosing [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] in a giant glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, an angry mob of townspeople approach the Simpsons' home. The family escapes through a [[sinkhole]] in [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s sandbox and flee to Alaska. 

Cracks start to appear in the dome and Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to become widespread, plans to destroy Springfield. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement for a new [[Grand Canyon]] to be located where Springfield is. Marge and the kids decide to go and save the town, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill them. The family abandon Homer and leave but are captured by the EPA and placed back in the dome. After a visit from a mysterious [[Inuit mythology|Inuit shaman]], Homer has an epiphany that he must save the town in order to save himself. Just as he arrives at Springfield to do so, a helicopter lowers a bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs to the peak of the dome and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and bomb off. Homer grabs the bomb and a motorcycle. After reuniting with Bart, they cycle up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb explodes, shattering the dome. The town praises Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset. The townspeople begin restoring Springfield back to normal.

==Production==
===Development===
The production staff had considered a film adaptation of ''The Simpsons'' since early in the series. The show's creator, [[Matt Groening]], felt a feature length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series.<ref name=creators>{{cite news | author = Edward Douglas | title = The Creators of The Simpsons Movie! | publisher = Comingsoon.net | date = [[2007-07-24]] | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=22484 | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> He intended the film to be made after the show ended, "but that [...] was undone by good ratings."<ref name=variety/> There were attempts to adapt the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]] episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]" into a film, but difficulties were encountered in expanding the episode to feature-length.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mark Kirkland, David Silverman|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> For a long time the project was held up.

===Animation===
[[Image:David Silverman in 2007-cropped.JPG|right|thumb|Director [[David Silverman]] looked at some of the television episodes he had directed for inspiration.]]
Animation for the film began in January 2006,<ref name="pig feces"/> with the ''[[Itchy & Scratchy]]'' short being the first scene to be [[Storyboard|storyboarded]].<ref name=com>{{cite video | people=Brooks, James L.; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Scully, Mike; Silverman, David; Castellaneta, Dan; Smith, Yeardley|year=2007|title=Audio commentary| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Groening rejected making either a [[live action]] or a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film,<ref name="totalfilm"/> describing the film's animation as being "deliberately imperfect", and "a tribute to the art of [[traditional animation|hand-drawn animation]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6273738.stm|title='Clumsy' Simpsons movie promised|accessdate=2007-07-05|date=[[2007-07-05]]|author=Neil Smith|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The film was produced in a widescreen [[anamorphic format|2.35:1]] aspect ratio, to distinguish it from the look of the television series,<ref name=officialsite/><ref name=com/> and colored with the largest palette the animators had ever had available to them.<ref name=creators/> A lot of the animation was produced using [[Wacom#Cintiq|Wacom Cintiq]] tablets, which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production.<ref name=com/> Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world: [[Film Roman]] in [[Burbank, California]], [[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[Glendale, California]], and [[AKOM]] and Rough Draft Korea in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. Like the television series, the storyboarding, characters, background layout and [[animatic]] parts of production, were done in America. The overseas studios completed the [[Traditional animation#Animation|animation]], [[tweening|in-betweening]] and [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|digital ink and paint]] processes.<ref name=com2/>

Director [[David Silverman]] said that unlike the TV series where "you [have] to pick and choose", the film gave them the opportunity to "lavish that attention [on] every single scene." The characters have shadows, unlike in the show.<ref name=nytimes/> Silverman and the animators looked to films such as ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Les Triplettes de Belleville|Triplets of Belleville]]'', and ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' for inspiration, as they were "a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed".<ref name=nytimes/> They also looked for ideas for a dream sequence, in Disney films such as ''[[Dumbo]]'' and the [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] cartoon ''Pluto's Judgment Day'',<ref name="totalfilm"/> and for crowd scenes in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''.<ref name=moviesonline/> Silverman looked at some of the ''Simpsons'' episodes he had directed, primarily his two favorites, "[[Homie the Clown]]" and "[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]".<ref name=silvermaninter>{{cite news|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2280|title=Interview: 'Simpsons Movie' Director David Silverman Loves Making D'oh|accessdate=2007-07-31|date=[[2007-07-31]]|author=Peter Brown|publisher=iF Magazine}}</ref> [[Mike B.

For inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film, the production staff spent a long time looking at a poster that featured more than 320 ''Simpsons'' characters.<ref name=ew>{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20035330,00.html | title = Inside 'The Simpsons Movie' | accessdate = 2007-05-05 | author = Dan Snierson | date = [[2007-04-27]] | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Groening said they tried to include every single character in the film, with 98 having speaking parts,<ref name="pig feces"/> and most members of the crowds being previously established characters instead of generic people.<ref name=com/> The series' regular voice actors: [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], and [[Harry Shearer]], as well as semi-regular performers [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Pamela Hayden]] and [[Marcia Wallace]], reprised their roles.<ref name=variety/> [[Joe Mantegna]] returned as [[Fat Tony]],<ref name="fattony">{{cite news|url=http://www.creators.com/lifestylefeatures/hollywood-exclusive/jon-cryer-and-lisa-joyner-plan-june-wedding-joe-mantegna-pulls-eclectic-string-of-roles.html|title=Jon Cryer and Lisa Joyner Plan June Wedding/Joe Mantegna Pulls Eclectic String of Roles|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=creators.com}}</ref> while [[Albert Brooks]], who supplied many guest voices in episodes, was hired as [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Russ Cargill]],<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonsmovie.com/main.html|title=About the DVD|publisher=The Simpsons Movie.com|accessdate=2007-11-29}} Go to the Simpson's house, click on Lisa's book, then on "Production Notes".</ref> after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film.<ref name=moviesonline/> For "about a week", he was to reprise the role of [[Hank Scorpio]] from the episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", but the staff felt that creating a new character was a better idea.<ref name=com2/>

Although he does not provide the voice, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] is [[President of the United States]] in the film. He was chosen instead of the incumbent President [[George W.

===Editing===
Every aspect of the film was constantly analyzed, with storylines, jokes and characters regularly being re-written.<ref name="com"/> Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget restrictions,<ref name="empire"/> ''The Simpsons Movie'' crew continued to edit their film into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May, two months before the film was released.<ref name=com/> James L. Brooks noted, "70 percent of the things in [one of the trailers]&mdash;based on where we were eight weeks ago&mdash;are no longer in the movie".<ref name=ew/> Groening said that enough material for two more movies was cut.<ref name="totalfilm"/> Various new characters were created, and then cut because they did not contribute enough.<ref name="empire"/> Originally Marge was the character who had the [[Prophecy|prophetic vision]] in church. The writers however considered this too dark and it was changed to Grampa.<ref name=com/> The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He was previously named Dexter and Adrien, and his appearance was completely altered.<ref name=moviesonline/> One idea was to have [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] act as Lisa's love interest, but the writers realized "the audience was not as familiar with [his] long-standing crush on [Lisa] as [they had] thought".<ref name=com/> A [[car chase]] in which Homer throws flaming [[Mummy|mummies]] out of a truck at the EPA was replaced with "more emotional and realistic" scenes at the motel and carnival that allowed for a change of pace.<ref name=com/> 

Further changes were made after the March 2007 preview screenings of the film in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona]].<ref name=com/> This included the deletion of [[Kang and Kodos]] heavily criticizing the film during the [end credits.<ref name="pig feces"/> A lot of people at the screenings found the original film too coarse, and some of Homer's behavior too unkind, so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer.<ref name=com/> Russ Cargill was re-designed several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Albert Brooks based on [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. The older model was the one used by [[Burger King]] for the action figure.<ref name=com/> Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story, and the "[[List of animals in The Simpsons#Plopper|Spider-Pig]]" gag was also a late addition.<ref name=moviesonline/> One excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund.<ref name=com/> Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end,<ref name=ploppersback>{{cite news|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/808/808965p1.html|title=SDCC 07: The Simpsons Panel|accessdate=2007-07-29|author=Eric Moro|date=[[2007-07-28]]|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> and several musical numbers that appeared throughout.<ref name="com"/> A news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut because it did not fit the overall context of the film.<ref name=com/>

Al Jean described the film's message as being "a man should listen to his wife". In addition, the film parodies two major contemporary issues, religion and environmentalism.<ref name=breath>{{cite news | author = Daniel Martin | title = Breathe a sigh of relief, The Simpsons Movie is brilliant | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = [[2007-07-05]] | url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/07/breathe_a_sigh_of_relief_the_s.html | accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> The theme of environmentalism is present in Homer's polluting of Lake Springfield, Green Day's cameo, and Lisa and Colin's romance.

Religion is focused on in Grampa's momentary possession, and Marge believing what he said to be a message from God.<ref name=reuters/> Groening joked the film "posit[s] the existence of a very active God", when asked if he believed it was likely to offend.<ref name=breath/> Mark I. Pinsky, author of ''The Gospel According to The Simpsons'', said the film "treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds". Regarding the scene where the tenants of [[Moe's Tavern]] and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the "chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility". In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, "It is [the] willingness of ''The Simpsons'' to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated, relationship with religion."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=24886|title='The Simpsons Movie' - Does faith, religion hit 'Homer' in Springfield?|accessdate=2007-08-02|date=[[2007-08-01]]|author=Mark I.
