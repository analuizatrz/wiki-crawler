'''TCF Bank Stadium''' is the future [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] for the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] [[college football]] team at the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. By enrollment, the university is the fourth largest college campus in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web| title= NCES Digest of Education Statistics| url= http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d05/tables/dt05_215.asp| date= 2005| accessdate= 2007-03-24}}</ref> The 50,000 seat on-[[campus]] "[[horseshoe]]" style stadium is under construction and planned to be built in time for the 2009 football season.

==History==
[[Image:Minnesota State Capitol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minnesota State Capitol]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]. Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] signed the TCF Bank Stadium bill in May 2006 at the University of Minnesota [[McNamara Alumni Center]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stadium Bill Signed at McNamara|url=http://www.alumni.umn.edu/Stadium_Signing.html|date=[[May 25]], [[2006]]|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota via University of Minnesota Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>]]
The push for a new on-campus stadium for the Golden Gopher football team began in the fall of 2000. The university cited poor revenue and lack of a college football atmosphere at the off-campus [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] as their main reasons for wanting to move back.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Hippert  | first = Rebecca  | title = STUDENT SENATE MINUTES  | publisher = University of Minnesota Student Senate  | date = [[April 19]], [[2001]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/usenate/ssen/010419stu.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | last = Pugmire  | first = Tim  | title = U of M may go it alone in stadium chase  | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio  | date = [[December 13]], [[2002]]  | url = http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/13_pugmiret_stadium/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref>  A plan for a joint [[Minnesota Vikings]]/University of Minnesota football stadium was proposed in 2002, but differences over how the stadium would be design and run, as well as state budget constraints, led to the plan's failure.<ref>>{{cite news   | last = Scheck  | first = Tom  | title = Committee kills Vikings stadium plan | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio | date = [[February 18]], [[2002]]  | url = http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200202/18_khoom_stadiums/index.shtml | accessdate =  }}</ref>  In September of 2003 a highly publicized attempt was made by [[T.

Finally on [[March 24]], [[2005]], the university and TCF Bank announced a deal that would have the bank contribute $35&nbsp;million towards the project which would give them naming rights.<ref name=newstadium>{{cite web  | title = TCF Financial Corporation gives $35 million  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = [[March 24]], [[2005]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Gophers_new_TCF_Bank_Stadium.html  | accessdate = 2006-01-10 }}</ref>  The deal was given an expiration date of [[December 31]], [[2005]]; time enough for the [[Minnesota Legislature]] to provide the bulk of funding needed to make the project a reality.<ref name=dec31>{{cite web  | title = Stadium sponsorship agreement with TCF extended  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = [[December 28]], [[2005]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Stadium_sponsorship_agreement_with_TCF_extended.html  | accessdate = 2005-12-28 }}</ref>  

During the remainder of 2005 the university concentrated on drafting a stadium proposal that would draw the support of state [[politician]]s.  The final plan proposed that the state of Minnesota would contribute 40% of the stadium cost while the university would raise the remaining 60% on its own.  Portions of that 60% were to be funded by the TCF naming rights, while the remainder would come from a $50 per semester student fee, private donations, the sale of 2840&nbsp;acres (11.5&nbsp;km²) of university land in rural [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] back to the state, and game day parking revenue.<ref name=newstadium />  Even though the university proposal drew widespread legislative support, the stadium effort suffered a setback when the 2005 legislative session ended before the stadium [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] could be heard.<ref name ="leg">{{cite web  | title = At the Legislature  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/legislature.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>  Late in 2005 when it became evident that this would happen, the university and TCF Bank announced that it had extended the naming rights deal to [[June 30]], [[2006]].<ref name=dec31 />

Despite the 2005 session having ended with the bill not even coming to a vote, the stadium effort did not lose momentum in the legislature and was introduced quickly in the 2006 session.  On [[April 6]], [[2006]], the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] passed the stadium bill on a 103&ndash;30 vote.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for H.F.

The proposed funding that was removed was to be replaced with a state wide [[tax]] on [[sports memorabilia]]. It also would have required the stadium to be named Veterans Memorial Stadium (which would be similar to the previous on-campus football stadium Memorial Stadium, which was last used in 1981 and then demolished in 1992).<ref name=mpr5906>{{cite news  | last = Sheck  | first = Tom  | title = Senate passes stadium bills for Twins, Gophers, and Vikings  | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio  | date = [[May 9]], [[2006]]  | url = http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/05/09/gopherstadium/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref> Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] stated he supported the House version.<ref>{{cite news

Even though the differences between the house and senate bills were major, the details were ironed out and approved on [[May 19]], [[2006]] in a House&ndash;Senate [[Conference committee|conference committee]].  The TCF Bank naming rights and land sale remained in the bill, as did a scaled down $25 per year student fee.  The tax on sports memorabilia as well as the Veterans Memorial Stadium name were voted out.

The stadium was planned as the centerpiece of a 75-acre research park called the East Gateway District on the East Bank side of the Twin Cities campus, expanding an existing precinct and adding a new Medical Biosciences Building.

==Location==
The TCF Bank Stadium site is located on the northeast side of the Minneapolis campus, near the site of the former [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]]. The new stadium's site had been the location of the Huron Boulevard Parking Complex, where the university's four largest parking lots were located.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Stadium Location  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = [[July 18]], [[2006]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/location.html#  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>   The address will be 2009 University Ave S.E.<ref name="logo" /> 

The stadium is part of a 75&nbsp;acre (.3&nbsp;km²) expansion of the Twin Cities campus, the largest since the [[University_of_Minnesota#West_Bank|West Bank]] was built in the 1960s. Current plans for the area call for the construction of as many as 10 new academic buildings by 2015.<ref name="stribmjs" /> The proposed [[Central Corridor (Minnesota)|Central Corridor]] [[light rail]] transit line is expected to run near the stadium, with a [[Train station|station]] in [[Stadium Village, Minneapolis|Stadium Village]] serving the facility. Construction of the Central Corridor is scheduled to begin in 2010 and be completed by 2014.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Central Corridor Light-Rail Transit Factsheet  | publisher = Metropolitan Council  | date = December, 2006  | url = http://metrocouncil.org/about/facts/CentralCorridorFacts.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>

An [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact assessment]] of the stadium site was conducted by the university between December of 2004 and March of 2006 at a cost of $1.5&nbsp;million.  The results were approved by the Board of Regents on [[March 27]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Environmental Review Process  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/environmental_review.html  | accessdate = 2007-05-21 }}</ref>

TCF Bank Stadium will be a horseshoe-style stadium which organizers say will have a "traditional collegiate look and feel".<ref name=newcost />  The first phase of the construction will include approximately 50,200 seats, with the design able to support future expansion to 80,000 seats.

Infrastructure work at the stadium site began in late June 2006, and a [[Groundbreaking|ceremonial groundbreaking]] took place at the stadium site on [[September 30]], [[2006]].  The beginning of construction on the stadium itself along with the unveiling of the stadium's [[logo]] took place on [[July 11]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium logo unveiled to signal start of Gopher football stadium construction  | publisher = University of Minnesota | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/news_details.php?release=070706_3399&page=UMNN  | accessdate = 2007-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium™ Construction PHASE 3  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/phase3.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>  Site preparation and [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] work will continue through the summer and fall of 2007, with work on the stadium's [[steel]] skeleton beginning the following winter.  It is anticipated that the stadium's external structure will be completed in the fall of 2008, leaving just under a year to complete internal finishing, [[landscaping]], and lighting.<ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium Construction Timeline | publisher = Gophersports.com  | url = http://www.gophersports.com/PhotoAlbum.dbml?SPSID=38605&SPID=3280&DB_OEM_ID=8400&PALBID=12198 | accessdate = 2007-07-11 }}</ref>

==Other uses==
While TCF Bank Stadium will be the game day venue of the Golden Gophers football team, the university has identified a number of other anticipated uses for the facility.  The stadium will replace [[Northrop Auditorium]] as the home of the [[University of Minnesota Marching Band]], providing the band with new storage, rehearsal, and locker facilities.  The university also expects to use the stadium for [[intramural sports]], career fairs, and graduation ceremonies.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Hopp  | first = Deborah  | title = The U's new stadium is about more than football  | publisher = St. Paul Pioneer Press  | date = [[February 28]], [[2006]]  | url = http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/02/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref>  

Several potential non-university uses for the stadium have been discussed as well.  [[Minnesota State High School League]] state tournaments, concerts, and marching band and [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum corps]] competitions have all been considered.<ref>{{cite book |last= University of Minnesota |title= University of Minnesota On-Campus Football Stadium - Final EIS |year= 2003}}</ref>  TCF Bank Stadium has been named as a possible location to host preliminary [[Football (soccer)|soccer]] matches if [[Chicago]] wins its [[Chicago 2016 Olympic bid|bid]] to host the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news   | last = Yue  | first = Loren  | title = Chicago 2016 turns to Minnesota for help  | publisher = Chicago Business  | date = [[January 10]], [[2007]]  | url = http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=23441  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref>  Should the [[Minnesota Vikings]] successfully carry out a plan to build a new stadium on the current site of the [[Hubert H.
