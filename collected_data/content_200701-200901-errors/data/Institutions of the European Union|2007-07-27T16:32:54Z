{{Life in the European Union}}
The [[European Union]] is governed by a number of institutions which are laid out in the [[treaties of the European Union]]. The structure has remained fairly similar since the [[Treaties of Rome]] even though their relationships have changed. In addition to the official institutions there are a number of other bodies and agencies, most of which also have a basis in the treaties.

==Treaty Institutions==
There are five official institutions. In treaty order, they are:
* the [[European Parliament]];
* the [[Council of the European Union]];
* the [[European Commission]];
* the [[Court of Justice of the European Communities]];
* the [[European Court of Auditors]].

===Executive===
The '''[[European Commission]]''' acts as an [[executive branch|executive]] or [[civil service]] of sorts. It is currently composed of one member from each state (currently twenty-seven) and is responsible for drafting all proposed law, a duty over which it maintains a monopoly in order to co-ordinate [[European Law]], as well as ensuring the treaties are followed (the "Guardian of the Treaties"). It also controls some agencies and the day-to-day running of the Union. Its [[President of the European Commission|president]] (currently [[José Manuel Barroso]]) is selected by the [[European Council]] and subsequently approved by the Parliament, along with the remainder of the Commission.

===Legislature===
[[Image:European-parliament-strasbourg-inside.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Strasbourg Hemicycle.]]
The '''[[Council of the European Union]]''' (also known as the "Council of Ministers") forms the first half of the Union's [[legislative branch]]. It is composed of the national ministers responsible for the area of EU law being addressed; a law regarding agriculture, for example, would go to a Council composed of national agriculture ministers. As a result the body primarily represents the national interest of member-states. The institution's [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]] rotates between the member states every six months; to provide continuity, every three presidencies co-operate on a common agenda. This body should not to be confused with the [[European Council]] below or the non-EU [[Council of Europe]].

The '''[[European Parliament]]''' forms the second half of the Union's legislative branch. Its membership, 785 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs), are the only EU officials directly elected by [[Elections in the European Union|popular vote]], once every five years. Its members sit according to political groups rather than nationality and elect the Parliament's [[President of the European Parliament|president]], currently [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]].

===Judiciary===
The [[judicial branch]] of the Union consists primarily of the '''[[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice of the European Communities]]''', the supreme court of the Union, higher than national supreme courts. The institution is composed of one judge nominated by each member-state, with the president elected from among those nominees, and eight advocate generals who together ensure European law and treaties are interpreted in a uniform way. The current president is [[Vassilios Skouris]]. It should not to be confused with the non-EU [[European Court of Human Rights]]. 

Below the Court of Justice there is a lower court called the '''[[Court of First Instance]]''' created to lift some of the work load of the Court of Justice. It consists of twenty-seven members, including its president (currently [[Bo Vesterdorf]]). There is also an eight-judge '''[[European Union Civil Service Tribunal|Civil Service Tribunal]]''' including a president, currently [[Paul J. Mahoney]]. The tribunal deals with discipline among European civil servants.

Outside the Court of Justice, the '''[[European Court of Auditors]]''' monitors the Union's accounts. Its president is [[Hubert Weber]].

==Major non-institutional bodies==
===European Council===
Another major body of the Union is the '''[[European Council]]''', known informally as the "European Summit". Although with no specific authority and not currently recognised as an official institution, the Council is seen as the supreme political body of the Union as it tends to guide the Union's policy-making. It is composed of the member states' heads of state or government and the [[President of the European Commission]] and meets four times a year, either in Brussels or at a venue in the [[Presidency of the European Union|Presidency]]'s country. Its president, the "President-in-office of the European Council", is currently [[José Sócrates]].

===Financial bodies===
[[Image:Eurotower in Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|right|185px|The Central Bank in Frankfurt.]]
The '''[[European Central Bank]]''' controls [[monetary policy]] within the [[Eurozone]] and is the key financial institution whose duty is to ensure price stability. Its independence means there is little control over it from the institutions; however, its governing board does contain the governors of all Eurozone national central banks. It is at the centre of the [[European System of Central Banks]] which comprises all EU national banks. Its president is appointed by the [[European Council]], currently [[Jean-Claude Trichet]]. 

The Union's financing institution is the '''[[European Investment Bank]]''', providing capital for projects within European policy objectives. Its board of govoners is composed of the twenty-seven national finance ministers. The chairman of its board of directors and management committee is [[Philippe Maystadt]].

===Advisory bodies===
There are also two [[Advisory bodies to the European Union|advisory committees]] to the institutions: 
* The '''[[Economic and Social Committee]]''' advises on economic and social policy (principally relations between workers and employers) being made up of representatives of various industries and work sectors. Its 344 members, appointed by the Council for four-year terms, are organised into three fairly equal groups representing employers, employees and other various interests. Its president is [[Dimitris Dimitriadis]]. 
* The '''[[Committee of the Regions]]''' is composed of representative of regional and local authorities who hold an electoral mandate. It advises on regional issues. It has 344 members appointed every four years by the Council. Member are organised in political groups and its president is [[Michel Delebarre]]. Although it has no powers of its own it must be consulted by the Council and Commission on various matters.

==Other bodies and agencies==
The '''[[European Ombudsman]]''' deals with citizens grievances against the Union's institutions and is elected for five-year terms by the Parliament. The current [[Ombudsman]] is [[Nikiforos Diamandouros]].

The '''[[European Data Protection Supervisor]]''' (EDPS) ensures the institutions respect citizens' privacy rights in relation to data processing. The current supervisor is [[Peter Hustinx]].

Three inter-institutional bodies are:
* the '''[[Office for Official Publications of the European Communities]]''', which publishes and distributes official Union publications. The Office's director-general is [[Thomas Cranfield]];
* the '''[[European Personnel Selection Office]]''' (EPSO), a recruitment body which organises competitions for posts within Union institutions. Its director is [[Erik Halskov]]; 
* the '''[[European Administrative School]]''' (EAS), which provides specific training for the staff of Union institutions. Its director is [[David Walker]].

'''[[OLAF]]''' (''Office Européen de Lutte Anti-Fraude'') deals with investigating fraud in the institutions and therefore operates independently of institutions such as the Commission. It is, howevever, classed as a [[General Services in the European Commission|General Service]] in the Commission. It was established in [[1999]] and its director is [[Franz-Hermann Brüner]].

There are numerous '''[[Agencies of the European Union|other specialised agencies of the EU]]''', usually set up by secondary legislation though sometimes written into treaties, for example [[Europol]]. The agencies are usual set up to deal with a specific area, such as Food Safety (the [[European Food Safety Authority]]) or defence procurement and development (the [[European Defence Agency]]). These agencies tend to be decentralised across the Union.

==Locations of the institutions==
{{main|Location of European Union institutions}}
There is no official "capital city of the European Union", with institutions spread across a number of cities. Though with most concentrated in [[Brussels]], that city is often considered the ''de facto'' capital of the Union. The seats of the institutions and some other bodies are guaranteed by the treaties<ref>Protocol 8 of consolidated versions of the treaty on European Union and of the treaty establishing the European Community and later [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf EurLex] and soon by Protocool 6 of the [[European Constitution]] [http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/en/treaties/dat/12004V/htm/C2004310EN.01026001.htm EurLex]</ref>.

[[Image:Armoiries Bruxelles.svg|20px|]]&nbsp;'''[[Brussels]]''' is the seat of the [[European Commission]] (staff of about 23,000) and the [[Council of the European Union]]. The [[European Parliament]] also has its second seat in the city, being the venue for its committee meetings and mini-sessions. In addition it hosts nearly all [[European Council]] summits, the [[Committee of the Regions]], the [[Economic and Social Committee]] and numerous agencies of the Union (including the [[European Defence Agency]] and [[EUROCONTROL]]) as well as being the headquarters for non-EU institutions such as [[NATO]] and the [[WEU]]. As a result of this concentration, most representation towards the Union is in the city and it is the favoured city for any move towards a single "capital".

[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Court of Justice in Luxembourg.]]
[[Image:Coat of arms Luxembourg City.png|20px|]]&nbsp;'''[[Luxembourg City]]''' is the Union's ''de facto'' judicial capital housing all the Union's courts; the [[European Court of Justice]] (incorporating the [[Court of First Instance]]) and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. It also plays host to the [[European Investment Bank]] and the [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]], though the Parliament hasn't met in the city for decades (but the hemicycle still exists).

[[Image:Europaparlament.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Strasbourg seat of Parliament.]]
[[Image:Coat of Arms of Strasbourg.svg|20px|]]&nbsp;'''[[Strasbourg]]''' is the official seat of the [[European Parliament]], meeting there for twelve week-long plenary sessions each year. Because this is the official, and most iconic, seat, the Parliament is sometimes know as the "Strasbourg Assembly". However due to the costs of the two seats there is a strong movement to abandon this seat, however the movement is being blocked by the host nation, [[France]]. The city also hosts the headquarters of all bodies covered by the [[Council of Europe]], such as the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

Agencies and bodies are divided among the member states; for example, [[Image:Wappen-frankfurt.png|20px|]]&nbsp;[[Frankfurt]], as the largest financial centre in the Eurozone, hosts the Central Bank, while [[The Hague]] hosts [[Europol]]. Since the [[Enlargement of the European Union|2004 enlargement]], there has been a drive to put more agencies in the new member-states to make a more equal distribution. However some problems have been encountered with this, for example; [[Frontex]], the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many do not want to live in the agency's host city, [[Image:Grand CoA Warsaw.png|20px|]]&nbsp;[[Warsaw]], due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] in [[Image:Praha CoA CZ.svg|20px|]]&nbsp;[[Prague]] has met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.

==Institutional changes==
[[Image:Consttreat.jpg|right|thumb|The European Constitution includes amendements to the EU's institutions.]]
The [[Reform Treaty]] is still being negotiated, but the institutional amendments of its draft includes are expected to remain. In its current state, the European Council and Central Bank will become official institutions, the Council of the European Union will become the "Council of Ministers", and the Court of Justice of the European Communities will be renamed as the "Court of Justice of the European Union".<ref name="Reform Draft Open">{{cite web|title =Draft treaty modifying the treaty on the European Union and the treaty establishing the European community|date=[[2007-07-24]]|publisher=[[Open Europe]]|url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|accessdate = 2007-07-28 }}</ref>
