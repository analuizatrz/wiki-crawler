==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}

As [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] attempts to get a motor boat, a new shopping mall in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] is being built on sacred ground. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] condemns and protests the building of the mall. Thanks to her protest, it prompts the school to conduct an archaeological dig. When Lisa is digging, it reveals a human skeleton with wings. Springfield's residents are convinced it is an [[angel]], and Homer cashes in by moving the skeleton into the family's garage; however, Lisa is skeptical, believing it may not actually be an angel, and even attempting to have [[Stephen Jay Gould]] use it for research. After the tests fail, Springfield's religious zealots riot and destroy all of the scientific [[institution]]s.  In keeping with the typical collective Springfield intelligence, the victims of this rampage include a [[Christian Science]] library. Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton; however, it has disappeared.

When the skeleton reappears, it carries a foreboding message that [[Apocalypse|The End]] will come at sundown. As for science vs. religion, Judge Snyder issues a [[restraining order]] that keeps science and religion 500 yards apart at all times. Sundown approaches, and Springfield's citizens are frightened, but nothing catastrophic occurs. The skeleton suddenly yells "Prepare for the end... the end of high prices!" and is hoisted over to the entrance of a new discount shopping mall. Lisa realizes that the "end is near" saga was actually a publicity stunt for the mall as a way to exploit the deepest beliefs of people, and calls for a boycott of the mall. However, the bargain-hunting public still go shopping immediately. In the end Marge points out to Lisa that, despite all her skepticism, for a few seconds while the Angel was rising Lisa really did believe the Angel was real. Lisa denies this, but thanks her mother for her support in her moment of weakness.
