'''Dubstep''' is a [[genre]] of [[electronic music]] that has its roots in [[London]]'s early 2000s [[UK garage]] scene.  The name of the genre was coined by Ammunition Promotions.  Musically, dubstep is distinguished by its dark mood, sparse rhythms, and emphasis on [[bass (musical term)|bass]]. Dubstep started to spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006, with many websites devoted to the genre appearing on the [[Internet]] and thus aiding the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz.<ref>{{cite news|author=Wilson, Michael|title=Bubble and squeak: Michael Wilson on dubstep|work=Artforum International|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bubble+and+squeak%3a+Michael+Wilson+on+dubstep.-a0165312289|date= 1 November 2006}}</ref> Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' and online publications such as [[Pitchfork Media]], with a regular feature entitled ''The Month In: Grime/Dubstep''.  Interest in dubstep grew significantly after [[BBC Radio 1]] [[disc jockey#Radio disc jockeys|DJ]] [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled "Dubstep Warz") in January 2006.<ref name="teleg"/><ref name="Time1">{{cite web | author= O'Connell, Sharon | title=  Dubstep | work=  [[Time Out London]] | url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2083/3.html | date= 4 October 2006 |accessdaymonth=21 June | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref><ref name="Pitch1">{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39704-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= 16 November 2006 |accessdaymonth=21 June | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref>

{{sample box end}}Dubstep's early roots are in the more experimental releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of [[Grime (music)|grime]] into the [[South London]]-based [[2-step garage]] sound. These experiments often ended up on the B-side of a [[white label]] or commercial garage release.<ref name="teleg">{{cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=[[2006-10-14]] |last = de Wilde |first=Gervase |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/10/14/bmdubstep14.xml |title=Put a bit of dub in your step: a new form of dance music from Croydon is ready to conquer the world}}</ref><ref name="wire279">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/current/index.php |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |issue=279 |title=The Primer: Dubstep}}</ref><ref name="plasticman">{{cite web|title= Interview: Plasticman|work= Riddim.ca |url=http://www.riddim.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=49&Itemid=39 |author=Pearsall |date=[[2005-06-18]]}}</ref> Dubstep is generally [[instrumental music|instrumental]].  Like another, more vocal garage hybrid, grime, the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a [[minor key]] and can feature [[dissonant]] harmonies such as the [[tritone|augmented fourth]] within a [[riff]]. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of [[sample (music)|samples]], a propulsive, sparse rhythm,<ref name="cbc">[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/dub_style.html "South London calling" from CBC.ca website] Matthew McKinnon, January 30 2007</ref> and an almost omnipresent [[sub-bass]].  Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced [[techno]] such as [[Basic Channel]] to [[classical music]] or [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name="cbc" /><ref name = "Pitch5" /><ref name="RA101" />

===Rhythm===
Dubstep rhythms are usually [[syncopation|syncopated]], and often [[swung note|shuffled]] or incorporating [[tuplet|triplets]]. The tempo is nearly always in the range of 138-142[[beats per minute|bpm]].<ref name="cbc">.</ref>
Dubstep rhythms typically do not follow the [[four-to-the-floor]] patterns common in many other styles of electronic dance music such as techno and [[house music|house]], but instead tend to rely on a kickdrum based around the first and third beat of a bar (a characteristic inherited from 2-step garage) and longer percussion loops than the four-bar phrases present in much techno or house. Often, a track's percussion will follow a pattern which when heard alone will appear to be playing at half the tempo of the track; the double-time feel is instead achieved by other elements, usually the bassline. An excellent example of this tension generated by the conflicting tempo is [[Skream]]'s ''Rutten'', which features a very sparse rhythm almost entirely composed of [[kick drum]], [[snare drum]], and a sparse [[hi-hat]], with a distinctly [[half time (music)|half time]] implied 69bpm tempo. The track is instead propelled by a constant sub-bass following a four to the floor 138bpm pattern, and a sampled [[flute]] phrase.

In an ''Invisible Jukebox'' interview with ''The Wire'', dubstep artist and label owner [[Kode9]] commented on a DJ [[MRK1]] (formerly Mark One) track, observing that listeners "have internalized the double-time rhythm" and the "track is so empty it makes [the listener] nervous, and you almost fill in the double time yourself, physically, to compensate".<ref name="Wire269">''Invisible Jukebox'', [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] no. 269, July 2006</ref>

===Bass drops, rewinds and MCs===
Many dubstep tracks incorporate one or more "bass drops," another characteristic inherited from drum 'n' bass.  Typically, the percussion will pause, often reducing the track to silence, and then resume with more intensity, accompanied by a dominant subbass (often passing [[portamento]] through an entire octave or more, as in the audio example).

Rewinds (or reloads)<ref name="Nice1">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Interview with Joe Nice | date=[[2006-08-15]] | publisher= | url =http://www.getdarker.com/?id=5&fid=7&tid=53 | work =GetDarker | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | language = }}</ref> are another technique used by dubstep DJs.  If a song seems to be especially popular, the DJ will 'spin back' the record by hand without lifting the stylus, and play the track in question again. Rewinds are also an important live element in many of dubstep's precursors; the technique originates in dub reggae [[Sound system (DJ)|soundsystems]], and is also used at UK garage and jungle nights.<ref name="Clark4">{{cite news | first=Martin | last=Clark | coauthors= | title=The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | date=[[2006-07-14]] | publisher= | url =http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/37340-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | work =Pitchfork Media | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | language = }}</ref>

Taking direct cues from [[Jamaica]]'s lyrically sparse [[deejay]] and [[toasting]] mic styles in the vein of [[reggae]] pioneers like [[U-Roy]], the MC's role in dubstep's live experience is critically important to its impact<ref>[http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2006/09/low-end-theory Low End Theory: Dubstep Merchants | XLR8R<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. As the music is largely instrumental, the MC operates in a similar context to [[drum and bass]] and is generally more of a complement to the music rather than the deliverer of lyrical content<ref>[http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?id=82272 Boomkat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Notable mainstays in the live experience of the sound are MC Sgt Pokes and MC Crazy D, both from London<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/mar/04/urbanmusic.features</ref><ref>http://inyourbass.com/blog/articles/39</ref><ref>http://www.totalkiss.com/Channels/Music/Music_DJPage.aspx?djId=73</ref>. Production in a studio environment seems to lend itself to more experimentation, however; Kode9 has collaborated extensively with [[the Spaceape]], who MCs in a [[Rastafari movement#Music|dread poet]] style, whilst [[The Bug|Kevin Martin]]'s experiments with the genre are almost exclusively collaborations with MCs such as [[Warrior Queen (musician)|Warrior Queen]], [[Roll Deep|Flowdan]], and [[Tippa Irie]]. [[Skream]] has also featured Warrior Queen and grime artist [[Jamie Adenuga|JME]] on his debut album, ''[[Skream! (album)|Skream!]]''.

===Structure===
[[Image:DubwarDeepMedi24.jpg|thumb|right|Mala of Digital Mystikz]]
Early dubstep releases inherited a [[song structure (popular music)|structure]] similar to those used in drum and bass and UK garage, typically comprising an [[introduction (music)|intro]], a main section (often incorporating a bass drop), a [[bridge (music)|midsection]], a second main section similar to the first (often with another drop), and an [[outro]]. 

This rather rigid format has evolved in recent times, unlike in grime, where the focus tends to be on providing a musical framework - commonly eight- or sixteen-bar loops - for [[Microphone Controller|MC]]s to [[rap]] over. As a result, some grime DJs, such as [[Plastician]], have begun playing more dubstep,<ref name="Pitch5">{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/43074-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= 23 May 2007 |accessdaymonth=14 July | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref> and some grime MCs, such as JME, have released tracks with a dubstep sound or MCed directly over dubstep beats.  Coki and Mala of [[Digital Mystikz]] have experimented with abrupt, 16-bar intros and have produced tracks with dub vocalists,<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?id=20781 |title=Digital Mystikz - Haunted / Anti-War Dub |accessdate=2007-10-26 |work=Boomkat }}</ref> and dubstep artist and label co-owner [[Skull Disco|Sam Shackleton]] has moved toward productions which fall outside the usual dubstep tempo, and sometimes entirely lack most of the common tropes of the genre.<ref name="wire281">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/current/index.php |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |issue=281 |title=Rave from the grave: Skull Disco}}</ref>

Forward>> also ran a radio show on east London pirate station [[Rinse FM]], hosted by producer/DJ Kode9, owner of the [[Hyperdub]] label.<ref>[http://www.tempa.co.uk/art_kode_9.html Tempa<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="kode9blog">http://www.kode9.com/</ref><ref name="fiddy">[http://chantellefiddy.blogspot.com/2006/03/introducing-kode-9.html Chantelle Fiddy's World of Whatever: Introducing...

Producers including D1, Skream and [[Benga (musician)|Benga]] make regular appearances.<ref name="djmag">.</ref>

Another crucial element in the early development of dubstep was the Big Apple Records record shop in [[Croydon]].<ref name="Time1" /> Key artists such as Hatcha and later Skream worked in the shop (which initially sold garage and drum and bass, but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area),<ref name="wire279" /> while Digital Mystikz were frequent visitors.  El-B, Zed Bias, Horsepower, and a young Loefah regularly visited the shop as well.<ref name="Time1" /> The shop and its record label have since closed down<ref name="Mugan"/> and reopened under the name Mixing Records.

===Origins of the scene: 2002&ndash;2005===
[[Image:Skream live.jpg|thumb|right|Dubstep producer Skream, one of the most widely known names in the scene]] Throughout 2003, DJ Hatcha pioneered a new direction for dubstep on Rinse FM and through his sets at Forward>>.<ref name="Time1" /><ref name="Pitch3" /> Playing sets cut to 10" one-off reggae-style [[dubplate]]s, he drew exclusively from a pool of new South London producers&mdash;first [[Benga (musician)|Benga]] and Skream,<ref name="Pitch3" /> then also Digital Mystikz and Loefah&mdash;to begin a dark, clipped and minimal new direction in dubstep.<ref name="'Pitch6/05'"> {{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10330-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep |title=Column: The Month in Grime / Dubstep |accessdate=2007-07-18 |last=Clark |first=Martin |date=2005-06-22 |work=Pitchfork Media }}</ref> 

South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, [[dub music|dub]] values, and appreciation of [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] bass weight to the dubstep scene.<ref name="Mugan" /> Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.<ref name="Pitch2">{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10331-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= 20 July 2006 |accessdaymonth=4 July | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref>

After releasing 12"s on Big Apple, they founded DMZ Records, which has released thirteen 12"s to date.

DMZ's first anniversary event (at the Mass venue, a converted church) saw fans attending from places as far away as Sweden, the U.S., and Australia, leading to a queue of 600 people<ref name="RWD"/> at the event. This forced the club to move from its regular 400-capacity space<ref name="Pitch1" /> to Mass' main room, an event cited as a pivotal moment in dubstep's history.<ref name="RA101" /><ref>{{cite web | author= Clark, Martin | title=  The Month In: Grime/Dubstep | work=  [[Pitchfork]] | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10337-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep | date= 8 March 2006 |accessdaymonth=10 July | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref>

In 2004, [[Aphex Twin|Richard James]]' label, [[Rephlex]], released two compilations that included dubstep tracks - the (perhaps misnomered) ''Grime'' and ''Grime 2''.

===Evolution of the sound: 2007-present===
[[Image:MaryAnneHobbsOnDecks.jpg|thumb|right|BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs]] Techno artists and DJs are now assimilating dubstep into their sets and productions.<ref name="RA101" />  Shackleton's "Blood On My Hands" was remixed by [[minimal techno]] producer [[Ricardo Villalobos]] (an act reciprocated when Villalobos included a Shackleton mix on his "Vasco" EP) <ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/51419-vasco-ep-part-1 Vasco EP Part 1 | Pitchfork<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and included on a mix CD by [[Panoramabar]] resident Cassy.<ref name="RA101" />  [[Ellen Allien]] and [[Apparat (musician)|Apparat]]'s 2006 song "Metric" (from the [[Orchestra of Bubbles]] album)<ref name="Orch1">{{cite news | first=Nate | last=De Jong | coauthors= | title=Stylus Review of "Orchestra of Bubbles" | date=[[2006-04-19]] | publisher= | url =http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/ellen-allien-apparat/orchestra-of-bubbles.htm | work =Stylus Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-19 | language = }}</ref><ref name="Orch2">{{cite news | first=Philip | last=Sherburne | coauthors= | title=Pitchfork Review of "Orchestra of Bubbles" | date=[[2006-05-04]] | publisher= | url =http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15164-orchestra-of-bubbles| work =Pitchfork Media | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-19 | language = }}</ref>, [[Modeselektor]]'s Godspeed (from the 2007's Happy Birthday! album, among other tracks on that same album) and Roman Flugel's remix of [[Riton (musician)|Riton]]'s "Hammer of Thor" are other examples of dubstep-influenced techno.<ref name="RA101" />  Berlin's  Hard Wax record store (operated by influential<ref name="metro">[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=6949 Losing your mind in Berlin (Metro Times Detroit)]</ref> dub techno artists Basic Channel)<ref name="sherburne1">[http://phs.abstractdynamics.org/2005/11/ philip sherburne: November 2005 Archives<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="blackdownbc">[http://blackdownsoundboy.blogspot.com/2007/04/on-friday-night.html Blackdown: One Friday night<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> has also championed Shackleton's [[Skull Disco]] label, later broadening its focus to include other dubstep releases<ref name="Pitch5" />, whilst the same label's sound can be heard as an influence more and more within the genre, with producers such as [[2562 (musician)|2562]] and [[Martyn (dubstep musician)|Martyn]] adopting a similar minimal aesthetic{{Fact|date=October 2008}}.

Some critics have also seen a dubstep influence in the Britney Spears song "Freakshow" (from her 2007 album [[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]), which Tom Ewing describes as "built around the 'wobbler' effect that's a genre standby."<ref name="'ewing'">{{cite news | first=Tom | last=Ewing | coauthors= | title=Column: Poptimist #10: Britney in the Black Lodge (Damn Fine Album) | date=2007-11-20 | publisher= | url =http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47096-column-poptimist-10 | work =[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | language = }}</ref><ref name="'oc'">{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Segal | coauthors= | title=Have You Heard of This Britney Spears Chick? | date=2007-11-06 | publisher=[[Village Voice Media]] | url =http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/new-releases/have-you-heard-of-this-britney/ | work =Heard Mentality:The [[OC Weekly]] Music Blog | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | language = }}</ref> 

Much like drum and bass before it, dubstep has started to become incorporated into other media, particularly in the United Kingdom. In 2007, Benga, Skream, and other dubstep producers provided the soundtrack to much of the second series of [[Dubplate Drama]], which aired on [[Channel 4]] with a soundtrack CD later released on [[Rinse FM|Rinse Recordings]]. The sound also featured prominently in the second series of the teen drama [[Skins (TV series)|Skins]], which also aired on Channel 4 in early 2008.

As the genre has spread to become an international rather than UK-centric scene, it has also seen a number of women making headway into the scene in a variety of ways. Alongside Soulja of Ammunition Promotions and Mary Anne Hobbs, an influx of female producers, writers, photographers and DJs all have broken through, in the up-til-then male orientated scene, without making gender an issue. With key 12" releases on [[Hyperdub]], [[Immigrant (record label)|Immigrant]] and [[Hotflush Recordings]], producers [[Vaccine (musician)|Vaccine]], [[Subeena]] and [[Ikonika]] have introduced a palette of new sounds and influences to the genre, such as double-time bass drums, [[chiptune|8-bit]] [[video game]] samples, hand percussion and lushly arranged strings <ref name="timeoutlondon">[http://www.timeout.com/london/clubs/features/5005/Women_in_dubstep.html Women in dubstep - Time Out London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Mary Anne Hobbs commented that the mood at dubstep nights is less aggressive, or more meditative, leading to a larger female attendance at events than with the genre's precursors, noting "Grime and drum 'n' bass raves tend to be quite aggy. People in dubstep clubs tend to have a more meditative approach, which is inviting to females. You see the female-to-male ratio constantly going up – it’s got the potential to be 40:60".<ref name="timeoutlondon" />

Cook's Drumz of the South [[flickr]] page documents the evolution of the scene in a photographic timeline of sorts, and was for a time the only photographic archive of the key events such as the early FWD and DMZ nights in London<ref name="timeoutlondon" /><ref>[http://www.melissabradshaw.net Decks in the City<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/drumzofthesouth Flickr: infinite's Photostream<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/collective/gallery/2/static.shtml?collection=dubstep BBC - Collective - Gallery - Dubstep<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

The summer of 2007 saw dubstep's musical palette expand further, with [[Benga]] and [[Digital Mystikz|Coki]]  scoring a crossover hit (in a similar manner to Skream's "Midnight Request Line") with the track "Night", which gained widespread play from DJs in a diverse range of genres. [[Radio 1]] DJ [[Gilles Peterson]] named it his record of 2007, and it was also a massive hit in the equally bassline-orientated, but decidedly more [[four-to-the-floor]] genre of [[bassline house]]<ref name="Clark9">[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/46889-the-month-in-grime-dubstep Pitchfork Feature: Column: The Month in Grime / Dubstep<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, whilst Burial's late 2007 release ''[[Untrue]]'' (which was nominated for the 2008 [[Mercury Music Prize|Nationwide Mercury Music Prize]] in the UK) incorporated extensive use of heavily manipulated, mostly female, 'girl next door' vocal samples<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90611642 Burial: Beautiful Dread, Inviting and Sinister : NPR Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.
