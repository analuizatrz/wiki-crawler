The '''Bell R-12 (Model 48)''' was an [[United States|American]] 1940s military utility helicopter built by [[Bell Helicopter]] company.

==Development==
During [[1946 in aviation|1946]] Bell Helicopter began development of a new helicopter, much larger, that [[Bell 47|Model 47]]. It was partly basing upon its construction, first of all, a rotor system, and was basically a scaled-up version of Model 47. The basic variant was civilian [[Bell Model 42|Model 42]], but the [[United States Air Force]] got interested in the design and ordered development of its military variant, '''Model 48'''. Two prototypes were ordered as the '''XR-12'''. It was powered by a 540 hp [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340]]-AN-1 [[radial engine]] and seated five. A production batch of 34 helicopters was ordered, under a designation '''R-12A''', but it was cancelled afterwards. Another enlarged prototype (the '''XR-12B''', Model 48A) with seats for eight and a more powerful 600 hp R-1340-55 engine was also ordered. It was followed by ten pre-series helicopters '''YR-12B''', with a redesigned cabin, with a glazed nose, instead of car-like nose<ref>[http://www.aviastar.org/helicopters_eng/bell_48.php Bell Model 48]</ref>. With a change in designation system the helicopter was re-designated the '''H-12'''. Test were not satisfactory, there were initially problems with a main rotor, and none were ordered.

==Variants==
;'''XR-12''':prototype, redesignated XH-12, two built.
;'''R-12A''':production version, 34 on order cancelled.
;'''XR-12B''':prototype with more powerful engine and increased seating, re-designated XH-12B, one built.
;'''YR-12B''':as XR-12B but with R-1340-55 engines, re-designated YH-12B, ten built.
;'''XH-12''':XR-12 re-designated in 1947.
;'''XH-12B''':XR-12B re-designated in 1947.
;'''YH-12B''':YR-12B re-designated in 1947.
