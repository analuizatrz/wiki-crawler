'''Michael Peter Balzary''' (born [[October 16]], [[1962]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]), better known by his [[nickname]]/[[stage name]] '''Flea''', is an [[Australia]]n-American [[bassist]] for the [[alternative rock]]/[[funk rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and a frequent [[session musician]] for other music acts.  He has also [[actor|acted]] in a number of [[motion pictures|movies]].

==Early life==
===Family life===

Michael Balzary lived a relatively conventional childhood in [[Melbourne, Australia]], until his father Mick, a customs officer, was posted to [[New York City|New York]] in March 1967. Mick Balzary relocated his entire family to New York, including wife Patricia, his daughter Karen, and 5-year-old Michael. 

In 1971, only four years after arriving in the [[United States|U.S.]], Balzary's mother, Patricia, fell in love with jazz musician Walter Urban, Jr. and filed for divorce from Mick Balzary. Michael Balzary, his mother, sister, and soon-to-be-stepfather moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1972. {{Fact|date=January 2007}}

Balzary developed an affinity for [[music]] at a very early age. He first played the [[drums]], then he began the [[trumpet]] at age nine. Balzary displayed strong natural aptitude for the instrument and swiftly earned a place in the [[Los Angeles Junior Philharmonic Orchestra]]. 

Watching his stepfather playing with his bebop [[jazz band]] profoundly affected the eleven-year-old Balzary. His stepfather's musicianship inspired a lifelong love of jazz and the leading exponents of the genre, such as [[Miles Davis]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Ornette Coleman]]. On [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'', Balzary said that he had no original interest in [[rock and roll]], and that his initial ambition was to become a jazz musician like his stepfather. 

===Fairfax High School===

Balzary was an avid trumpeter and jazz fan when he began attending [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]] in September 1976. On his first day at Fairfax, Balzary was "play-fighting" with fellow tenth-grade student Tony Shurr in the quadrangle, when  Balzary's future bandmate, [[Anthony Kiedis]], came to Shurr's defense. Despite the initial enmity between Balzary and Kiedis, the two swiftly became best friends. As their friendship grew, Balzary introduced Kiedis to the world of jazz. 

Balzary continued to improve his trumpet skills, taking the rank of first trumpet in the Fairfax school orchestra. Kiedis admired Balzary for his constantly swollen lip (as noted in Kiedis's autobiography, ''Scar Tissue''). 

Through Kiedis, Balzary soon became friends with another Fairfax student and future bandmate, [[Hillel Slovak]]. Slovak played in a band called Anthym. Balzary's musical taste strayed from jazz when Slovak introduced him to rock music. Balzary soon became attuned to artists including [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The New York Dolls]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. 

Spurred by his newfound interest in rock, Balzary allowed Slovak to tutor him on bass guitar in 1978. In 1980, Todd Strassman, bassist for Anythm left the band to go to college.  Balzary joined the band at this time.

During a ski trip with Anthony Kiedis and friend Keith Barry, Balzary earned his long-standing nickname "Flea," which has become the singular name associated with the musician.<ref>http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/columns/the_history_of/the_history_of_flea_part_1.html History of the Flea (Accessed on January 21, 2007)</ref>

==Career==
While playing in [[What Is This?|Anthym]], Flea's exceptional bass skills attracted attention from outside the band. In 1982, Flea received an offer to become the new bass player for [[Fear (band)|Fear]], an aggressive punk band from Los Angeles. He accepted the offer, playing for a short period with both bands. 

In 1983, Flea, Kiedis, Slovak, and Irons formed the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. They were signed with EMI within 6 months. Flea left Fear to concentrate on working with the Chili Peppers. Balzary also turned down an offer to play in the post-Sex Pistols band [[Public Image Ltd.]] with his longtime idol, [[John Lydon]], as he preferred to stay with his friends.

Flea has aided the careers of several prominent musicians, most notably [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]. In 1993, Flea met the unknown local artist, after he saw her perform at a local café. He went back to her van where she was currently living, where she sang a few of her songs. He described her singing voice as being "beautiful" and "breathtaking". Two years after this encounter Jewel was signed to [[Atlantic Records]] and released her diamond record, ''[[Pieces of You]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calhoun |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |coauthors=Jensen |title=Revealing Jewel: An Intimate Portrait from Family and Friends |year=2003 |publisher=Atria |location=New York, NY |id=978-0743475402}}</ref>  Flea also helped establish the non-profit [[Silverlake Conservatory of Music]] in 2001 and mentors young musicians in that program.

Flea is the only member that has never left or been kicked out of the ''[[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]''.  However, he has currently gone on a break from the band to teach music at his [[Silverlake Conservatory of Music]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18617938/?GT1=9951]</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/25/AR2007052500362.html Washington Post:School Rocks!</ref>

===Performance Style===
Flea's uniquely fast approach to the popular "slapping and popping" bass technique influenced several musicians even before the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] broke into the mainstream. However, on the Chili Peppers' breakthrough album, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', Flea used the fused fast-slapping technique less than previous albums, stating that even though he'd made a name for himself from it, he felt as though he wouldn't be giving himself broad enough avenues of playing styles (as stated personally by Flea in the documentary ''Blood Sugar'', "Funky Monks"). He now utilises all three major bass playing techniques - thumbstyle (slap and pop), finger style and using a [[plectrum]]. Flea is also known for his energetic antics while performing live.

Flea's playing style is heavily influenced by bassist [[Bootsy Collins]] (who in turn was largely influenced by [[Sly & The Family Stone]] bassist [[Larry Graham]], the inventor of slap-bass), funk music, and by the energy of early [[punk rock]] bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]].

In the liner notes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation, Flea writes: {{cquote|I would like to mention the [[electric bass]] players who have had a huge influence on me and whom I have repeatedly stole from. They are... [[Jah Wobble]], [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], [[James Jamerson|James Jamerson Sr.]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Eric Avery]], [[Aston Barrett|Aston Family Man Barrett]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Andrew Weiss]], [[Peter Hook]], and the bass players for [[Fela Kuti]].}}

===Instruments===
====Bass====
Flea's main basses have almost always been ones with [[pickup (music)#Active and passive pick-ups|active electronics]]. His signature live bass up until ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' was the [[Music Man StingRay]], which he also used to record the album ''[[Freaky Styley]]''. In the studios for ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]'' and ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' Flea used a [[Spector]] bass.  ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' was recorded with a [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] Mach II, Stingray 5 string and ''[[One Hot Minute]]'' with an [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]] Epic. From ''Californication'' onwards, he received a signature model from [[Modulus Guitars]], which is based on the StingRay. For ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'', he used a '62 [[Fender Jazz Bass|Fender Jazz bass]]. The Jazz bass was initially used during the subsequent Stadium Arcadium tour, but Flea later decided that he wasn't cutting through enough, and stopped using the Jazz bass in favor of his Modulus signature. Flea can be heard using several different [[effects pedals]] throughout his career, most notably an [[envelope follower]] ("[[The Power of Equality]]", "21st Century"), and an [[overdrive (music)|overdrive]] pedal ("[[Around the World (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Around the World]]", "[[So Much I]]"). 

The effects he uses at the moment are:

Boss ODB-3 Bass Overdrive<br />
MXR Micro Amp (booster)<br />
Electro Harmonix Q-Tron (envelope filter)<br />
Dunlop 105Q Bass Wah<br />

[[Image:fleaspedals.jpg]]

Flea's [[Gallien-Krueger]] amp rig equates to three 2001RB heads, three 410RBH cabinets and three 115RBH cabinets.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

====Trumpet====
Flea still plays trumpet occasionally, for example, as part of a [[horn section]] on the [[Jane's Addiction]] album [[Nothing's Shocking]], on [[Mike Watt]]'s ''Ball Hog or Tug Boat?'', on [[The Mars Volta]]'s second release ''[[Frances The Mute]]'', and with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] during a performance of ''[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]'' at Hollywood Rock '93, a music festival in Brazil. 

Most recently, he joined [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] on "The Third Movement of the Odyssey" for the ''[[Halo 2]]'' soundtrack.  The songs "Subway To Venus", "[[Pretty Little Ditty]]", and "[[Taste the Pain]]" on the Chili Peppers album ''[[Mother's Milk]]'', "[[Apache Rose Peacock]]" on ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', and "Tear" and "On Mercury" on ''[[By the Way]]'' also feature Flea on trumpet. Flea also plays trumpet in some of the songs on ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'', namely "Torture Me", "Slow Cheetah", and "Hump De Bump". On the song "Mercy Mercy" a b-side of ''[[Tell Me Baby]]'' Flea plays the trumpet. The bassist will, on occasion, play trumpet during the Peppers' live performances, as demonstrated on the "[[Live at Slane Castle]]" DVD and the "Live in Hyde Park" double CD.

===Independent work===
====Solo====
After the release of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' One Hot Minute album, Flea briefly pursued a solo career. While he never released an album, a few demos of his songs survive, like "You Got Stuck With Me" and "Fiberoptics". Additionally, his song "I've Been Down" was released on the original movie soundtrack for ''[[The Basketball Diaries (film)|The Basketball Diaries]]''.

====Session====
In 1982, Flea was the bassist for [[Fear (band)|Fear]] before choosing to stick with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. He played bass on the hit 1989 single ''Bust a Move'' by [[Young MC]]. He played with Gibby & Andrew Weiss ([[Butthole Surfers]]) and [[Johnny Depp]] in 1995 in a band called [[P (group)|P]] on the 'Michael Stipe' [[7"]]. He played trumpet on Jane's Addiction's ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'', and filled in for [[Eric Avery]] on bass during their reunion tour in 1997. Flea also has played on [[Porno for Pyros]] 1996 album "[[Good God's Urge]]" and played a few shows with them in 1997. 
He played bass for [[The Mars Volta]] on 2003's ''[[De-Loused in the Comatorium]]'' and trumpet for 2005's ''[[Frances the Mute]]''. He also played bass for [[Alanis Morissette]] on the acclaimed song 'You Oughta Know', as well as guest appearances on countless albums by other artists. Flea has also played in support of the activist group [[Axis of Justice]].

====Acting====
Flea made his acting debut in the 1984 cult classic punk drama ''[[Suburbia (movie)|Suburbia]]'' where he was credited as "Mike B. The Flea." His filmography also includes ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'', ''[[Motorama (film)|Motorama]]'', ''[[Dudes (film)|Dudes]]'', ''[[Son in Law]]'', ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'', ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', ''The Blue Iguana'', ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''Liar's Poker'', ''[[Mr. 3000]]'', and the [[Psycho (1998 film)|1998 remake]] of the [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] classic ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. More notably, Flea played the character [[Other Characters in Back to the Future#Douglas J. Needles|Douglas J. Needles]] in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (although he disliked the film, calling it a "Multi million dollar piece of trash"<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw2SW1fIWg0]</ref>) and provided the voice of the [[feral children|feral boy]] Donnie in the animated television series and [[The Wild Thornberrys Movie|film]] ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]''. Flea also appears in [[Mike Gordon]]'s 2002 film ''[[Rising Low]]'' which is about 25 bassists who recorded an album with [[Gov't Mule]] following the death of their bassist [[Allen Woody]].
