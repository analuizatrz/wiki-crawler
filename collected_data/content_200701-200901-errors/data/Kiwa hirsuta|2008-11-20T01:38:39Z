'''''Kiwa hirsuta''''' is a [[crustacean]] discovered in 2005 in the South [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | author = E. Macpherson, W. Jones & M. Segonzac | year = 2006 | title = [http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/front/medias/publication/6892_z05n4a3.pdf A new squat lobster family of Galatheoidea (Crustacea, Decapoda, Anomura) from the hydrothermal vents of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge] | journal = [[Zoosystema]] | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 709–723}}</ref> This [[Decapoda|decapod]], which is approximately 15 [[centimetre|cm]] (6 [[inch]]es) long, is notable for the quantity of silky blond [[setae]] (resembling fur) covering its [[pereiopod]]s ([[thorax|thoracic]] legs, including [[claw]]s). Its discoverers dubbed it the "[[yeti]] [[lobster]]" or "yeti [[crab]]."<ref name="BBC">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4785482.stm |title='Furry lobster' found in Pacific |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2006-03-08]]}}</ref>

''K. hirsuta'' was discovered in March 2005 by a group organized by Robert Vrijenhoek of the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] in [[Monterey, California]] and Michel Segonzac of the [[Ifremer]], using the [[submarine]] [[DSV Alvin|DSV ''Alvin'']], operating from RV ''Atlantis''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbari.org/expeditions/eastermicroplate/ |title=Easter Microplate Expedition March 12–April 6, 2005 |publisher=[[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]]}}</ref> The discovery was announced on the 7th of March, 2006. It was found 1,500 [[kilometre|km]] (900 [[mile]]s) south of [[Easter Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], at a depth of 2,200 [[metre|m]] (7,200 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]), living on [[hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[Pacific-Antarctic Ridge]].<ref>{{cite news | title = French Journal Says New Crustacean Found | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/07/ap/tech/mainD8G71SI05.shtml | date=[[2006-03-07]] |publisher=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> Based on both [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[molecular biology|molecular data]], the species was deemed to form a new [[genus]] and [[family (biology)|family]] ('''Kiwaidae'''). The animal has strongly reduced eyes that lack [[pigment]], and is thought to be blind.

The "hairy" pincers contain [[filamentation|filamentous]] [[bacteria]], which the creature may use to detoxify poisonous minerals from the water emitted by the [[hydrothermal]] vents where it lives. Alternatively, it may feed on [[bacteria]], although it is generally thought to be a [[carnivore]].<ref name="BBC" /> Its diet also consists of green [[algae]] and small [[shrimp]].

Although it is often referred to as the "furry lobster" outside the [[scientific literature]],<ref name="BBC"/> ''Kiwa hirsuta'' is not a true [[lobster]] but is more closely related to [[squat lobster]]s and [[hermit crab]]s. The term "furry lobster" is more commonly used for the family ''[[Synaxidae]]''.

==Etymology==
Macpherson ''et al.'' named the genus ''Kiwa'' after "the goddess of the shellfish in the Polynesian mythology," although [[Kiwa (mythology)|Kiwa]] is a male guardian of the sea in [[Maori mythology]].<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Elsdon Best]] | title = The Maori - Volume 1 | chapter = IV. Cosmogony and Anthropogeny | pages = 89–105 | chapterurl = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bes01Maor-t1-body-d4.html |year=1924}}</ref> ''Hirsuta'' means "hairy" in [[Latin]].

== In popular culture ==
[[Folk rock]] singer-songwriter [[Jonathan Coulton]] wrote a song entitled "Furry Old Lobster" as part of his "Thing-a-Week" project. It references not the furry lobster described in this article, but a kind of [[otter]] and its disappearance.<ref>[http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2005/12/09/thing-a-week-12-furry-old-lobster/ Jonathan Coulton » Blog Archive » Thing a Week 12 - Furry Old Lobster<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://areasofmyexpertise.com/lobsters.html Is this the furry lobster you were referring to?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> An unspecified type of furry lobster also appears in the mythology of [[John Hodgman]]'s fake almanac, [[The Areas of My Expertise]]; this was published shortly before the discovery of ''K. hirsuta''.

The webcomic [[Sheldon_(webcomic)|Sheldon]] ran a strip a few weeks after the announcement of ''K. hirsuta'' discussing the unusual nature and speculating on the long-term future of the species.<ref>[http://www.sheldoncomics.com/archive/060326.html Sheldon strip published March 26, 2006]</ref>

The immediate public interest in ''K. hirsuta'', which included a plush toy produced in Japan, led Segonzac to ponder what he called a "cuddly-toy sentimentality" and whether people were trying to "escape the present".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Deep |last=Nouvian |first=Claire |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=The Univeristy of Chicago Press |location= |isbn=0-226-59566-8 |pages=219 }}</ref>
