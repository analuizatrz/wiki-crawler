'''Lewis Carl Hamilton''' (born [[January 7]], [[1985]] in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Formula One]] [[Auto racing#Single-seater racing|driver]]. Hamilton started racing [[kart racing|karts]] at the age of eight. When he was ten,<ref>http://www.f1-live.com/f1/en/drivers/hamilton.shtml</ref> he approached [[McLaren]] team owner [[Ron Dennis]] at an awards ceremony and told him he would drive for McLaren one day; four years later, Hamilton was signed to the McLaren driver development support programme. Hamilton became [[Europe]]an karting champion in 2000 with maximum points and made a successful transition to racing cars the following year. 

He progressed through the junior formulae, achieving titles in [[British Formula Renault Championship|British Formula Renault]], [[Formula Three Euroseries|European Formula Three]] and [[GP2 series|GP2]]. He was appointed as a Formula One driver for McLaren in [[2007 Formula One season|2007]]. In his first season in the top international single seater category he became the first [[rookie]] driver to lead the world championship, finishing on the podium in his first nine races and winning four out of the first fifteen Grands Prix of the 2007 season. Hamilton signed a multi-million pound contract with [[HarperCollins]] for his autobiography.<ref>{{cite news

==Personal and early life==
Hamilton's [[paternal]] grandparents emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] from [[Grenada]] in the 1950s. His grandfather worked on the [[London Underground]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Grenadian roots of first black F1 driver |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/11/061127_grenadaf1.shtml |date=[[2006-11-27]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> His mother Carmen and father Anthony, (who is now an IT consultant), named him after the US Olympic gold medal winning athlete [[Carl Lewis]].<ref>Sourced from [[ITV]]'s 2007 Bahrain Grand Prix commentary</ref> Hamilton's parents separated when he was two and, until he was ten, he lived with his mother and half-sisters Nicola and Samantha.<ref>{{cite news |title=MY BOY RACER| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20070701/ai_n19341883 |date=[[2007-07-01]] |publisher=[[Daily Mirror]] |accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref> After that he lived with his father, step-mother Linda and half-brother Nicholas who has [[cerebral palsy]].

==Early career==
===Karting===
Hamilton began [[kart racing|karting]] in 1993 at the age of eight,<ref name="BBC_07-06-19">{{cite news

I'm going to race for McLaren". From the Cadet ranks (1993-7), he progressed through the Junior Yamaha (1998) and Junior Intercontinental A (1999) divisions, earning him attention from [[McLaren|Team McLaren]], who signed him to the McLaren driver development support program. This contract included an option of a future F1 seat, thus making Hamilton the youngest ever driver to secure an F1 contract.<ref name="BBC_07-06-19" />

Lewis Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In [[Formula A]] and [[Formula Super A]], racing for TeamMBM.com, his team mate was [[Nico Rosberg]], who would later drive for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team in Formula One. Following his karting successes, the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]] made him a ‘Rising Star’ Member in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren.com/theteam/lewis_hamilton_biography.php|title=Lewis Hamilton Biography|publisher=Vodafone McLaren Mercedes official website|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>

Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth overall. This led to a full 2002 [[British Formula Renault Championship|Formula Renault UK]] campaign with Manor Motorsport. Hamilton finished third overall with three wins and three pole positions. He remained with Manor for another year and won the championship with ten wins and 419 points to the two wins and 377 points of this nearest rival, [[Alex Lloyd (racing driver)|Alex Lloyd]]. Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the [[British Formula Three Championship]]. Here he was less successful: in the first race he was forced out with a puncture,<ref>{{cite news

Hamilton and Manor then made their debut in the [[2004]] [[Formula Three Euroseries]]. They won just one race and Hamilton was fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix and raced one of the [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau F3 Grand Prix]]. Hamilton first tested for [[McLaren]] in late 2004, at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].<ref>{{cite news

He moved to reigning Euroseries champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds. He also won the [[Ultimate Masters of Formula 3|Marlboro Masters of Formula 3]] at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]].<ref>{{cite news

After the season, British magazine ''[[Autosport]]'' featured him in their “Top 50 Drivers of 2005” issue, ranking Hamilton 24th. After Hamilton's success in Formula Three, he was signed by [[ART Grand Prix]] for the [[2006 GP2 Series season]]. Like ASM in F3, ART were the class of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with [[Nico Rosberg]]. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt.

Among his notable performances was a dominant win at the fifth round held at the [[Nürburgring]], despite serving a penalty for speeding in the [[pit stop|pit lane]]. At his home race at [[Silverstone]], supporting the [[British Grand Prix]], Hamilton impressed again by overtaking two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed (up to 150&nbsp;mph in a GP2 car) bends where overtaking is rare. He demonstrated his overtaking prowess again at the race in Istanbul, when he recovered from a spin that left him 18th, to take second place in the final corners. He became GP2 champion in unusual circumstances. [[Giorgio Pantano]] won the penultimate race at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], and set the fastest lap on the final lap, initially taking this bonus point from Hamilton. However, it transpired that he had set this under a yellow flag, indicating to the officials that he had not slowed enough to avoid potential danger, leading to him losing the fastest lap, which therefore gave Hamilton the single point he needed to clinch the title.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Luis Hamilton Sepang.jpg|thumb|right|Hamilton securing second place in Malaysia.]] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, [[Pedro de la Rosa]], [[Gary Paffett]] or former World Champion [[Mika Häkkinen]] would drive for McLaren alongside defending champion [[Fernando Alonso]] in [[2007 Formula One season|2007]], Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.

===Career===

[[Image:Lewis Hamilton 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Hamilton driving for [[McLaren]] at the [[2007 Malaysian Grand Prix]].]]

On his debut at the [[2007 Australian Grand Prix]], he qualified fourth and finished third in the race, thus becoming the fourteenth driver to finish on the podium on his GP début (excluding those in the first ever World Championship round).<ref name="Super Wheels">{{cite news|url=http://www.superwheels.co.za/default.asp?id=5221&des=sportstalk|title=Hamilton still has long way to go|work=Super Wheels|publisher=Reuters|date=2007-03-22|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> In [[2007 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]], Hamilton got his first front-row start, qualifying and finishing second behind [[Felipe Massa]].

Hamilton had to be content with second place at [[2007 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]]. He felt he was prevented from challenging for the win by his team. However the FIA later deemed that "McLaren did nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result."<ref>{{cite news| title =FIA McLaren-Monaco Full statement | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/6178.html| date =[[2007-05-30]]| accessdate =2007-06-05}}</ref>

Hamilton gained the first [[pole position]] of his F1 career in [[Montreal]] at the [[2007 Canadian Grand Prix]]. On race day, Hamilton led almost continuously from start to finish, despite having his lead cut on the four occasions the safety car was deployed. The win strengthened his championship challenge.<ref>{{cite news| title =Canadian Grand Prix | publisher =BBC Sport| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6739373.stm| date =[[2007-06-10]]| accessdate =2007-06-11}}</ref> A week later, Hamilton won the [[2007 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]] also from pole position, becoming the first Briton since [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] in [[1983 United States Grand Prix West|1983]] to win a Formula One World Championship race in the US, and only the second person after [[Jacques Villeneuve]] to win more than one race in his first F1 Championship season since the first year of the Championship itself. 

[[Image:Hamilton leading Silverstone 2007.jpg|thumb|Hamilton during his first British Grand Prix at [[2007 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]].]]
By finishing third at [[2007 French Grand Prix|Magny-Cours]] behind [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] drivers [[Kimi Räikkönen]] and Felipe Massa, Hamilton extended his lead in the Driver's Championship to 14 points. This was the first time in his F1 career that he finished a race in a lower position than he started, and the first time he had been passed on the racetrack in Formula One. At [[2007 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]], Hamilton's home Grand Prix, he started from pole and led for the first 16 laps of the race. He was unable to maintain this pace for the full race, finishing 40 seconds behind Räikkönen and Alonso but still leading the championship.

However as he kept his engine running he was lifted back on to the circuit and able rejoin the race after the restart. His 9th place finish in this race was both his first non-podium and non-points finish, enabling title contenders Alonso and Massa to reduce Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship. After Alonso was relegated five places for obstructing Hamilton in qualifying, Hamilton was able to extend his championship lead by winning the [[2007 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]]. [[Kimi Räikkönen]] stayed within five seconds of him for the entire race (excluding pit stop periods). However, the team was docked all of their constructor's points due to the incident in qualifying.

After declaring he had restored his relationship with Alonso,<ref name="Hamilton calls for truce">{{cite news| title = Hamilton calls for truce and targets the bigger battles ahead | url = http://sport.guardian.co.uk/motorsport/story/0,,2156086,00.html#article_continue| work = sport.guardian.co.uk| publisher = Guardian Unlimited | date = 2007-08-25| accessdate = 2007-08-25}}</ref> Hamilton qualified second in [[2007 Turkish Grand Prix|Turkey]].

At the Italian GP, Hamilton was beaten by Alonso, reducing his Championship lead to three points. Hamilton finished fourth behind Alonso at the Belgian Grand Prix, cutting his Championship lead to two points. However he extended his lead to 12 points after winning the [[2007 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese grand prix]] in adverse weather conditions, a race which Fernado Alonso retired from.

===Relationship with McLaren===

Hamilton's relationship with team boss Ron Dennis dates back to 1995.<ref>{{cite web| title = Hamilton 2007 Pre-season interview | url = http://www.sportinglife.com/formula1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=formula1/07/03/05/AUTO_Formula_One_Hamilton.html| publisher = Sporting Life | date = 2007-08-30| accessdate = 2007-08-30}}</ref> However, intense rivalry with teammate Alonso has led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso will leave McLaren at the end of the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite news| title =The future of Fernando Alonso| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns19511.html| date =[[2007-08-06]]| accessdate =2007-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Alonso cool on future at McLaren| publisher =news.bbc.co.uk| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/motorsport/formula_one/6932307.stm| date =[[2007-08-05]]| accessdate =2007-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Rumour: Hamilton to Ferrari?| publisher =muchhalasworld.com| url =http://www.muchhalasworld.com/2007/05/31/rumour-hamilton-to-ferrari/| date =[[2007-05-31]]| accessdate =2007-09-13}}</ref>

The first indication that Hamilton was discontented with his team was after he finished second at [[2007 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]]. After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA initiated an inquiry to determine whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders. McLaren denied favouring double world champion [[Fernando Alonso]], and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that: "McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars. They did nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result."<ref>{{cite news| title =FIA McLaren-Monaco Full statement | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/6178.html| date =[[2007-05-30]]| accessdate =2007-06-05}}</ref>

Tensions within the team were most clearly demonstrated at the [[2007 Hungarian Grand Prix]]. During final qualifying for the race, Hamilton was involved in a controversy that saw McLaren and Alonso penalised for delaying Hamilton in the pits - preventing Hamilton from putting in a final "hot lap" before the end of the session. McLaren blamed Hamilton for the incident,<ref>{{cite news| title = Dennis: Hold up is Hamilton's fault| publisher =f1.gpupdate.net| url =http://f1.gpupdate.net/en/news/2007/08/04/dennis-hold-up-is-hamilton-s-fault/| date =[[2007-08-04]]| accessdate =2007-08-05}}</ref> saying that he was supposed to let Alonso pass him and gain track position in the initial stages of the final qualifying session. Alonso was relegated to 6th place on the grid, thus elevating Hamilton (who had initially qualified second) to the number one slot. Hamilton won the race from his improved grid position, extending his championship lead by a further five points. Hamilton said he thought Alonso's penalty was "quite light if anything" and only regretted the loss of constructors' points.<ref>{{cite episode|title= Chequered Flag (podcast)| network= BBC| station= BBC Radio Five Live| minutes= 5:56}}</ref> On team radio following qualifying,  this exchange between Hamilton and Ron Dennis is reported to have taken place:<ref>{{cite news| title =Hamilton handed pole after Alonso punished| publisher =timesonline.co.uk| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article2199765.ece| date =[[2007-08-05]]| accessdate =2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =LEWIS F-WORD STORM| publisher =sundaymirror.co.uk| url =http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/sport/motorsport/2007/08/05/lewis-f-word-storm-98487-19574046/| date =[[2007-08-05]]| accessdate =2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Dennis feels the strain as McLaren team ethos stretched to breaking point by warring drivers| publisher =sport.guardian.co.uk| url= http://sport.guardian.co.uk/motorsport/story/0,,2142385,00.html| date =[[2007-08-06]]| accessdate =2007-08-07}}</ref>

During the 2007 European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, Hamilton became the first driver to have his car recovered by a crane and put back on the track during an F1 race, although several drivers have been pushed back onto the circuit by the marshals without mechanical aids when judged to be in a dangerous position, such as Michael Schumacher during the [[2003 European Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite news
