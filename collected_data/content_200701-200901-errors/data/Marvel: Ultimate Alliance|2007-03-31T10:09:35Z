'''''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] released by [[Raven Software]] and [[Activision]] in October 2006 in U.S. Previously referred to as '''''[[Marvel Legends]]''''', this game features more than 20 characters which are available to players and 140 character appearances in total.

==Story==
{{spoiler}}
[[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] has formed a new [[Masters of Evil]] in pursuit of an unknown goal. They then launch an attack on a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]]. [[Nick Fury]] sends out a distress call to all available meta-humans. [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] respond and proceed to eliminate Doom's forces. After saving the helicarrier, Nick is given the OK by the government to create a special task force of superhumans to counter the Masters of Evil.

==Features==
The game features over 140 characters from the Marvel Universe. Players are able to create teams, and have online and co-operative play, for up to 4 players. In arcade mode players will have to fight for the most kills in order to get the experience points at the end of the level. There are also special comic book missions, revisiting a moment in a character's past and facing a classic arch rival. Characters may have up to four costumes, which can alter the stats of the character.

Players will fight in mid air, underwater and on the ground, with fully destructible and interactive environments in over 17 locations, traveling around different locales on planet Earth, different dimensions, and even the depths of space by the end of the game. The game has alternative endings, affected by the decisions the player(s) make throughout the game. These endings are based on whether or not the player chooses to complete optional missions.

The game is quite rewarding for fans of Marvel's characters, providing lots of bonuses and nods to knowledgeable fans who know their comic history. Putting together teams of characters who have a shared history together, for example, may give team bonuses (ex. using [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Ms. Marvel]] on the same team would yield you the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], giving you a boost in attack damage for all team members). Using particular characters to interact with other NPCs can also yield additional dialogue, and villains will also react accordingly when met with their nemeses (for example, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] will talk directly to [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] or [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] upon seeing those characters in the first chapter). The game also features trivia games, artwork and many more references to the Marvel Universe.

While many characters in the game by default are rendered with the appearance they have in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics, the world of the game is predominantly based upon that of the [[Earth 616|original Marvel Universe]], with many villains, character designs and references to events that exist only in that continuity (for example, [[Galactus]] is the original Marvel Universe's version, not Ultimate Marvel's hive-minded robotic version).

==Versions==
The game is available for the [[Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Wii]] and PC. The graphical engine and looks differ between the various platforms. For the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[Xbox]], and [[Wii]], characters models are similar to ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse|X-Men Legends II]]'' style. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions feature more detailed character models and environments. The PC version vary depending on the customization of a user's settings, at maximum settings and shaders with premium hardware, the PC graphics will be similar to or better than the 7th gen. The PC version also features "intuitive mouse controls" <ref>[http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/game_info.php Marvel: Ultimate Alliance official site]</ref> and works with a gamepad. 

There are exclusive characters on the GBA, PSP, Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3. The PSP has four exclusive characters, the GBA has two exclusive characters, and the three next-gen systems share two exclusive characters. [[Moon Knight]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (the next-gen exclusive characters) are now playable on the PC version as well with a game mod. Activision has officially announced that there will be 8 additional downloadable characters on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace on Tuesday 10th of April 2007- [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Activsion to Release New Marvel: Ultimate Alliance Heroes and Villains on Xbox Live Marketplace|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/marvelultimatealliance/news.html?sid=6167963&om_act=convert&om_clk=gsupdates&tag=updates;title;1|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>  . It has not been said whether any other platforms will have access to these characters.

===GBA===
"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance" is drastically altered for the Game Boy Advance Port. The game is now a side-scrolling fighting game, with minor RPG elements (such as the ability to alter your characters stats). Also the graphics are compressed qualitywise for system and the character selection has been drastically reduced. 

Teams consist of three characters and a striker, a non-playable fourth character who can be summoned to perform a devastating attack directed toward on-screen enemies. 

Playable characters include: 
* Spider-Man (Starter Character)
* Wolverine (Starter Character)
* Iceman (Starter Character)
* Blade
* Captain America
* Deadpool
* Elektra
* Thing (Must be Unlocked)
* Ms. Marvel (Must Be Unlocked)
* Thor

Strikers include:
* Dr. Strange (starter striker)
* Ghost Rider
* Iron Man
* Dark Phoenix
* Namor the Sub-Mariner
* Vision

Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Iceman are the game's starter team with Dr. Strange as your striker. Blade, Deadpool, Captain America, Elektra, and Thor become unlockable after completing the first mission, along with striker Ghost Rider. As the game progresses, characters become unlocked as more missions are completed. 

Some additional gameplay modes are also included for additional gameplay: S.H.I.E.L.D. Simulator, Time Challenges, Scavenger Hunts, and a Survival mode.

===PSP===
The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version features simplified graphics, different characters, and extra features:
*Four exclusive playable Marvel characters: [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Ronin (comics)|Ronin]]
*One exclusive comic book villain: [[Andreas Strucker|Swordsman]]
*6 special comic book missions
*Microphone support ''(voice chat)'', via which players can speak with other players online
*Online-recordable player statistics
*Exclusive prequel missions
*Three exclusive single-player gameplay modes

===Wii===
[[Image:Marvel_7th.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Screenshot from E3 2006's 6th generation build.]]
The [[Wii]] version features:
*Specific motion-sensitive controls for normal moves
*Motion-sensitive controlled Special attacks, unique for each character
*Access to any special move at any time, which is unavailable for any other build.
*There is no online play, but there is a normal multiplayer mode in which up to four players may play at once.
*Does not have the five exclusive simulator missions available on the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions.

==Characters==
While ''Ultimate Alliance'' follows in the footsteps of Raven Software's ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' games, it has a broader scope of inclusion, adding playable heroes from [[Marvel Comics]]' other popular comics, including [[Spider-Man]], many different members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the entire [[Fantastic Four]]. In addition, each character has four different costumes. Most of these extra costumes are different costumes characters have had in their comics appearances; for example, Spider-Man has his black symbiote costume and his red and gold [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Tony Stark's "Iron Spider" costume|"Iron Spider"]] costume, as well as his classic red and blue costume. Some of the costumes are alternate versions of the same character or even entirely separate characters with similar powers or appearance: for example, many characters appear in their [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] versions, and both versions of the character [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] as well as the [[MC2]] character [[Spider-Girl]] are available via the costume change feature.

One major thing to note is that the version of Nick Fury used for Alliance is not the same as previously appeared in the X-Men Legends game. However, the [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] model that was previously used is still available as an alternate costume for Fury.

While all versions of ''Ultimate Alliance'' share a common core of initially-available and unlockable characters, many of the different versions have exclusive characters. The PC, [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox]] versions have only the basic core, while the PlayStation Portable version adds four characters, the Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and Wii versions share a pair of exclusive characters, and the Game Boy Advance version has two exclusive characters while lacking some of the unlockable characters.

The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] was going to be the final playable character, but as the rights to use the character are held by [[Sierra Entertainment]], this was not possible. However, the player meets Bruce Banner in the Omega Base & sees a defeated Hulk in a cinematic prior to the final mission. The character will be made available for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace in April 2007 (see [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance#Versions|above]]) 

As of March 23rd, it has been announced that the 360 version of the game will feature new content with 8 characters that updates them with costumes, special powers, and voice dialog for the game.  The new expansion pack will include 4 heroes The Hulk, Cyclops, Hawkeye, and Nightcrawler as well as 4 villans Doctor Doom, Magneto, Venom, and Sabretooth.  There is currently no word on if these characters will be made available for the PS3 or Wii.
