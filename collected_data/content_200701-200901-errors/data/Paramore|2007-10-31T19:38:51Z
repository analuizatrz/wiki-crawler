'''Paramore''' (pronounced "Par-a-mour" ({{IPAEng|ˈpærəmɔər}})) is an [[United States|American]] [[pop rock]]<ref name="poprock">{{cite web| title= Paramore| publisher= mp3.com| url= http://www.mp3.com/artist/paramore/summary/| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> band that formed in [[Franklin, Tennessee]] in [[2002]]. After several lineup changes, Paramore primarily consists of Hayley Williams ([[lead vocals]]), Josh Farro ([[lead guitar]]/[[backing vocals]]), Jeremy Davis ([[Bass Guitar|bass]]), and Zac Farro ([[Drum kit|drums]]).

Influenced by the likes of [[Jimmy Eat World]] and [[Sunny Day Real Estate]],<ref name="prog">{{cite news| title= Paramore in prog shock rock?| publisher= manchestereveningnews.co.uk| url= http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/rock_and_pop/s/1015556_paramore_in_prog_rock_shock| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> frontwoman Hayley Williams and lead guitarist Josh Farro are the group's primary songwriters. In 2005, the group released their debut album ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'', gaining a fanbase through touring and internet promotion of the singles "[[Pressure (Paramore song)|Pressure]]" and "[[Emergency (song)|Emergency]]." By 2007, the band gained mainstream notoriety with their second album ''[[Riot!]]''. The first single, "[[Misery Business]]," has received wide radio airplay and allowed for MTV to feature the band in Artist of the Week segments during August 2007. With their early success, much attention is paid to the young age of the band members; their ages range from 17 to 22.<ref>{{cite news| last= Mandia| first= Delia Rosa| title= Paramore rocks at a young age | publisher= ''Staten Island Advance''| date= [[2007-06-24]]| url= http://www.silive.com/living/advance/index.ssf?/base/living/118268101157980.xml&coll=1| accessdate= 2007-09-30}}</ref>

===Formation and ''All We Know Is Falling'' (2002-2005)===
At the age of 13, vocalist Hayley Williams moved from her hometown of [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], [[Mississippi]] to Franklin, Tennessee where she met brothers Josh and Zac Farro.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web| title= Biography| publisher= All Music| url= http://wc06.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0pfrxq8sldae~T1 | accessdate= 2007-08-16}}</ref> Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with [[Brett Manning]] and had also participated in school productions.<ref name="siren">{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| interviewer= David Walter| title= Youth Gone Wild| date= [[2007-10-17]]| url= http://www.soundthesirens.com/articles/index.php?id=8,334,0,0,1,0| accessdate= 2007-10-14}}</ref> Prior to forming Paramore, however, members of the group took part in a [[funk]] cover band.<ref name="funk">{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2= Josh Farro| interviewer= Joshua Martin| title= ASL's Exclusive Interview With Paramore| date= [[2007-06-26]]| url= http://www.socialitelife.com/2007/06/26/asls_exclusive_interview_with_paramore.php| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been "edgy about the whole female thing" of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were "really good friends", she "started writing for them" and it eventually "worked out".<ref name="Euro"/> The band was later officially formed by Josh Farro ([[lead guitar]]/[[backing vocals]]), Zac Farro ([[Drum kit|drums]]), Jeremy Davis ([[Bass Guitar|bass]]) and Williams ([[lead vocals]]) in 2004, with the later addition of Jason Bynum ([[Rhythm Guitar]]). They took the name Paramore, which is derived from a friend's mother's maiden name; once the group learned the meaning of the identically-sounding word ''paramour'' ("secret lover"), they decided to adopt the name, using the ''Paramore'' spelling.<ref name="Euro">{{cite interview |subject=Josh Farro |subject2=Hayley Williams |subject3= Jeremy Davis| interviewer=cathyreay |title= Interview With Paramore |date=[[2007-07-14]]| url=http://www.europunk.net/interviews.php?id=173 |accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> The band's first song written together was "Conspiracy", which was later used on their debut album.<ref name="hitherson">{{cite news| title= Paramore: All We Know Is Falling| publisher= hitherson.com| date= [[2006-06-15]]| url= http://hitherston.com/press/?p=8| accessdate= 2007-09-30}}</ref>
[[Image:Paramore 2005.jpg|thumb|In 2005, Paramore consisted of (l-r): Jason Bynum, Josh Farro, Hayley Williams and Zac Farro. This line up was used during promotion for ''All We Know is Falling'', however, Bynum was later replaced by Hunter Lamb.]]
Over the following years, Paramore performed at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]]. [[John Janick]], CEO and co-founder of the music label [[Fueled by Ramen]], got ahold of Paramore's demos and went to a [[Taste of Chaos]] performance in [[Orlando, Florida]] to see the band perform live. After a smaller private performance at a warehouse, the band was signed to the label in April 2005.<ref name="Trades">{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2=Josh Farro| interviewer= Tony Pascarella |title= Interview: Hayley Williams and Josh Farro of Paramore| date= [[2005-08-08]]| url= http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440 | accessdate= 2007-08-16}}</ref>

Paramore traveled back to Orlando to record their debut album ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'', but, shortly after arriving, Davis opted to leave the band citing personal reasons. The remaining four members of Paramore continued with the album, writing "[[All We Know]]" about his departure, and later deciding to base ''All We Know Is Falling'' around the concept. The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief as Williams explains, "The couch [on the cover of ''All We Know is Falling''] with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space."<ref name="Trades"/> Recording for ''All We Know is Falling'' had taken three weeks, and promotional material for the album had only featured the four of the remaining members. Before touring, the band added John Hembree ([[Bass Guitar|bass]]) to their line up.<ref>{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| interviewer= Jason Schleweis| title= Paramore Interview| date= [[2005-07-14]]| url= http://www.crushmediamagazine.com/paramoreinterview.html| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> After being asked by the band, Davis returned to Paramore, after five months apart, as Hembree left.<ref>{{citation| title= Paramore Kerrang!

Paramore released "[[Pressure (Paramore song)|Pressure]]" as its first single, with a video directed by [[Shane Drake]], but the song had failed to place on the charts. The video featured the band performing in a warehouse, eventually getting sprayed with water sprinklers as the storyline of a conflicted couple occurs. In July, "[[Emergency (song)|Emergency]]" was released as the second single, the video again reuniting the band with director Shane Drake and featuring Hunter Lamb, who replaced Bynum on guitar.<ref name="AMG"/> The video for "Emergency" showcased Paramore in another performance, this time fixing the members bloody and in worn costumes. The third single "All We Know", was released with limited airtime, and the video consisting of a collection of live performances and backstage footage. During that summer, Paramore was featured on the Shira Girl Stage of the 2005 Warped Tour.<ref name="Trades"/>



===''Riot!'' (2006-Present)===
In January of 2006 they were a part of the Winter Go West Tour where they played alongside Seattle bands [[Amber Pacific]] and [[The Lashes]], and in February, Williams' vocals were featured on "Keep Dreaming Upside Down" by [[October Fall]].<ref name="Oct Fall">{{cite web| title= October Fall - A Season in Hell| publisher= AbsolutePunk.net| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=118240 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> In the spring 2006, Paramore was an opening act on headlining tours for both [[Bayside]] and soon afterwards, [[The Rocket Summer]]. They toured the United Kingdom from [[October 5]] to [[October 15]], [[2006]], where they ended in London at The [[Mean Fiddler]]. The band then covered [[Foo Fighters]]' "[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]" for the ''[[Sound of Superman]]'' soundtrack which was released on [[June 26]], [[2006]].<ref name="Hero">{{cite press release| title= IT'S A BIRD, IT'S A PLANE™, IT'S SOUND OF SUPERMAN| publisher= Rhino| date= [[2006-03-23]]| url= http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=386 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref>  During the summer of 2006, Paramore played a portion of Warped Tour, primarily on the [[Volcom]] and [[Hurley International|Hurley]] Stages, and their first night on the Main Stage was at a date in their hometown of Nashville. Paramore's first United States headlining tour began on [[August 2]], [[2006]] to a sold-out audience<ref name="MTV"/> with support from [[This Providence]], [[Cute Is What We Aim For]], and [[Hit the Lights (band)|Hit the Lights]] with the final show in Nashville. That year they were voted "Best New Band", and Williams as #2 "Sexiest Female", by readers of the [[United Kingdom|British]] magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]''.<ref name="FBR">{{cite news| last= Fletcher| first= Alex| title= Paramore| publisher= fueledbyramen.com| date= [[2007-09-24]]| url= http://www.fueledbyramen.com/bands/index.php?id=44 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref>

In [[2007]], Paramore was named by British  magazine ''[[NME]]'' as one of ten bands to watch out for in their "New Noise 2007" feature.<ref name="FBR"/> In January, the band played an acoustic set for the grand opening of a Warped Tour exhibit at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]],<ref name="R&R">{{cite news| title= Warped adds Agent Orange, video from Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame exhibit| publisher= punknews.org| date= [[2007-02-09]]| url= http://www.punknews.org/article/22158 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> and the dress Williams wore in the video for "Emergency" was also put onto display in the exhibit.<ref name="Dress">{{cite news| last= Moseley| first= Brittany| title= Warped Tour: Thirteen years of memorabilia to Cleveland| publisher= Stater Online| date= [[2007-01-31]]| url= http://media.www.stateronline.com/media/storage/paper867/news/2007/02/01/Entertainment/Warped.Tour.Thirteen.Years.Of.Memorabilia.To.Cleveland-2689838.shtml | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> Paramore was featured in ''Kerrang!'' magazine once more, however, Williams believed the article was an untrue portrayal of the band, particularly because it focused on her as the main component. Afterwards, Williams addressed the issue in the band's [[LiveJournal]], with a post saying, "we could’ve done without a cover piece. sorry, if it offends anyone at kerrang! but i don’t think there was one bit of truth in that article."<ref>{{cite news| title= Paramore Not Happy About Kerrang Article| publisher= drivenfaroff.com| date= [[2007-05-31]]| url= http://www.drivenfaroff.com/2007/05/31/paramore-not-happy-about-kerrang-article/| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> In April, Williams' vocals were featured in "Then Came To Kill" by [[The Chariot (band)|The Chariot]].<ref name="Kill">{{cite web| title= God Makes Real Noise| publisher= PopMatters.com| url= http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/44051/the-chariot-the-fiancee/ | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref>

Paramore began recording their second album ''[[Riot!]]'' in January 2007, ending production in March, without the guitar of Hunter Lamb (who left the band early in 2007 to get married);<ref name ="AMG"/> without Lamb, lead guitarist Farro was required to play both guitar parts on the album.<ref name="cellar">{{cite interview| subject= Josh Farro| interviewer= Stephanie Keller| title= Paramore: They’re Looking for a Riot!| date= [[2007-05-01]]| url= http://www.thecellarmagazine.com/underground/?p=130| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> Lamb has since been replaced by guitarist Taylor York as temporary member for the duration of touring.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web| title= Paramore| publisher= mtv.com| url= http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/paramore/artist.jhtml#bio | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> After being courted by producers Neal Avron and [[Howard Benson]],<ref name="girl"/> Paramore opted to record ''Riot!'' with [[New Jersey]] producer David Bendeth, releasing the album on [[June 12]], [[2007]]. ''Riot!'' entered the Billboard 200 at number 20, the UK charts at number 24, and sold 44,000 its first week in the United States.<ref name="MTV"/> The name ''Riot!'' had been chosen because it meant "a sudden outburst of uncontrolled emotion", and it was a word that "summed it all up".<ref name="girl"/> The first single off of the album, released [[June 21]], [[2007]], "[[Misery Business]]," is, according to Williams, "more honest than anything I've ever written, and the guys matched that emotion musically."<ref name="FBR"/> Williams wrote the song about a past experience involving a male friend who she felt was being manipulated by a girl, and later on when Williams and her friend began to date, she penned the lyrics to "finally explain my side of the story and feel freed of it all".<ref name="Misery">{{cite web| title= redemption. it's a long story.| publisher= livejournal.com| date= 2007-06-27| url= http://paramoreband.livejournal.com/31376.html| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> Later, Williams addressed the lyrics in the chorus: 
[[Image:Paramore Misery.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Paramore's current line-up consists of (l-r): Josh Farro, Jeremy Davis, Hayley Williams and Zac Farro. In the music video for "Misery Business", the four confront a superficial girl.]]

{{cquote|But God does it feel so good<br>'Cause I got him where I want him right now<br>And if you could then you know you would<br>'Cause God it just feels so<br>It just feels so good}}

Williams felt that some might find the use of God "casually. in vain, to be blunt" as [[blasphemy]], and as a Christian, she doesn't want "to be held responsible for causing a lot of people to use my God's name in vain."<ref name="Misery"/> She posted an explanation and apology on the band's LiveJournal.
Paramore's video for the song featured the band performing in a room with the words 'Riot!' covering all surfaces, all intertwined with the storyline of a superficial girl who acts cruely to other students before being confronted by Williams. "Misery Business" was the third Paramore video to be directed by Shane Drake, and was nominated for the "Best Video" award at the Kerrang! Awards 2007, but lost to [[Fall Out Boy]]'s "[[This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race]]".<ref name="Kerrang Award">{{cite web| title= Kerrang Awards 2007: The Winners| publisher= Digital Spy| url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a73558/kerrang-awards-2007-the-winners.html | accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref> "Misery Business" is also featured on the soundtrack to the [[EA Sports]] video game [[NHL 08]].

Summer of 2007 saw Paramore participating on their third Warped Tour and posting journals of their experiences on [http://yourhereblog.mtv.com/?s=paramore. yourhereblog for MTV]. In June they were declared by [[Rolling Stone]] as "Ones to Watch".<ref>{{cite web| title= Paramore| publisher= rollingstone.com| url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/paramore| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> The second single off of ''Riot!'', "[[Hallelujah (Paramore song)|Hallelujah]]", was released on July 30, 2007, and is currently only available online and on UK television. The video, much like "All We Know", features backstage footage and live performances. In August 2007, Paramore had been featured in television spots on [[MTV]], performing acoustic versions of their songs or acting in short accompaniments to MTV program commercials. As "MTV Artists of the Week", the band filmed the faux camping themed spots in [[Queens, New York]], all written and directed by Evan Silver and Gina Fortunato.<ref name="Camp">{{cite web| title= Behind the Scenes: Paramore's TV Spots| publisher= mtv.com| url= http://www.mtv.com/photos/?fid=1567097 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> Mtv.com also has a collection of [http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?id=1566472&vid=165783 short videos] with the band to promote ''Riot'' as well.

==Musical style and influences==
The majority of Paramore's recordings come from collaborations between lead vocalist Hayley Williams and lead guitarist Josh Farro &mdash; Farro first writes the music, afterwords taking it to Williams for a melody and lyrics, and from that point the song worked out between the two.<ref name="Trades"/> Once the foundation is laid out, the remaining band members help to work on sound and arrangement. The duo's songwriting has been called "contrastly cliched and weak at points"<ref>{{cite web| title= Riot!

Review| publisher= sputnikmusic.com| url= http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=18631| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> Williams' vocals have often been cited as "completely top notch" enough to accompany those lyrics; the same has been said of Farro's guitar.<ref>{{cite news| title= Paramore - Live| publisher= caughtinthecrossfire.com| date= [[2006-10-15]]| url= http://www.caughtinthecrossfire.com/music/live/2341| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref><ref name="Josh"/> 

Joshua Martin had written after an interview with Williams, "The band isn't just a short pop-punk girl with red hair and a spunky attitude. Their music is like them, it's aged differently. It's sped up, and slowed down. It's emo without being whiney, or bratty. Almost a very literal anti-[[Avril Lavigne]]."<ref name="funk"/> ''[[Alternative Press]]'' magazine had commented that the band was "young sounding", yet "honest".<ref name="NN">{{cite interview| subject= Josh Farro| subject2= Jeremy Davis| interviewer= Charlotte Otter| title= Interview: Paramore | url= http://www.new-noise.net/features/interview-paramore_1965.html| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> Paramore's first album ''All We Know is Falling'' had an arguably more "formulaic pop-punk" sound that was "delivered particularly well"<ref name="decoy">{{cite web| last= Davies| first= Alex| title= Paramore - Riot!| publisher= decoymusic.com| url= http://www.decoymusic.com/index.php?content=reviews&reviewid=23086&oldreview=0| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> and the combination of the two had created a "refined rock infused pop/punk album".<ref>{{cite web| last= Schleweis| first= Jason| title= Paramore| date= [[2005-07-26]]| url= http://www.crushmediamagazine.com/Paramore-AllWeKnowIsFallingReview.html | accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> The band's second release, ''Riot!'', had shown Paramore in their development as a band, "exploring a diverse range of styles", however, not straying far from "their signature sound".<ref name="decoy"/>

''Alternative Press'' and various other reviewers have noted that the band's stage performances have helped boost them to larger fame. ''Alternative Press'' states that Williams "has more charisma than singers twice her age, and her band aren't far behind in their chops, either."<ref>{{Cite news| title= Bamboozle Recap: Day 1| publisher= altpress.com| date= [[2007-05-06]]| url= http://altpress.com/news/747.htm| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> Because of the female fronted aspect of the band, Paramore has gained comparisons to [[Kelly Clarkson]] and the afore mentioned Avril Lavigne, to which one reviewer said was "sorely unfounded".<ref>{{cite web| last= Pascarella| first= Tony| title= Music Review: Paramore, "All We Know Is Falling"| publisher= the-trades.com| date= [[2007-07-20]]|url= http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3377| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last= Drumm| first= Alex| title= Paramore| publisher= emotionalpunk.com| url= http://www.emotionalpunk.com/cdreview/293/| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> Williams has gone on to comment about the female aspect of the band saying that Paramore isn't "this girl-fronted band" and it makes "music for people to enjoy music, not so people can talk about my sexuality."<ref name="girl">{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2= Josh Farro| interviewer= Julia Conny| title= Paramore| date= [[2007-05-25]]| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/printthread.php?t=239981| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref>

Reviewer Jonathan Bradley noted that the band's music had a sound derivative from that of early emo band [[Rites of Spring]], sharing with its predecessors' "unabashed sincerity", however, "notably omit[ing] much of the neurotic self-examination."<ref>{{cite web| last= Bradley| first= Jonathan| title= Paramore - Riot! - Review| publisher= stylusmagazine.com| date=[[2007-08-13]]| url= http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/paramore/riot.htm| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> A reviewer at ''NME'' had likened Paramore's sound to that of "[[No Doubt]] (stripped of all the [[ska]] bollocks)" and "Kelly Clarkson's wildest dreams".<ref>{{cite web| title= Review| publisher= nme.com| url= http://www.nme.com/reviews/paramore/8695| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref>

Although they believe themselves to be considered a pop music band by others, they were influenced by various rock music artists. Paramore has expressed their influence for creating the band and their music had come from appreciation for [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Death Cab for Cutie]] and [[Failure (band)|Failure]]; Williams citing her personal influences as [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]] and [[Etta James]].<ref>{{cite news| title= Questions and Answers with Paramore| publisher= paramore-fans.com| date= [[2007-09-19]]| url= http://www.paramore-fans.com/article/2/questions-and-answers-with-paramore| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> Williams explained that bands such as [[U2]], "who are massive, and do whatever they want, write whatever they want and they stand for something", Jimmy Eat World, "who I don’t think ever disappoint their fans", and [[No Doubt]], who "have done amazing things", act as a pattern for the path in which Paramore would like to take their career.<ref name="prog"/>
