==Plot==
[[Image:Parineeta 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Shekhar and Lalita on the day of their apparent marriage]]This film adaptation of [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]'s 1914 novella, ''[[Parineeta]]'', places the story in the [[Kolkata]] of 1962. As the credits roll, scenes from the erstwhile [[Calcutta]] are displayed along with the narrator's ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) introduction of the era to the audience. The narration focuses on the night of the marriage of Shekhar ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) and Gayatri Tantya ([[Diya Mirza]]), a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Navin Rai ([[Sabyasachi Chakravarthy]]) as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar readying himself for the occasion. While he is doing that, images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighborhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married. 

[[Image:Parineeta 2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Girish and Charu during their card game with Lalita and Koel]]An angry Shekhar comes back home to play a favorite tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing the [[Rabindranath Tagore]]’s tune on his piano while young Lalita and Koel are around. Lalita, with her parents having died in a car accident, lives with Gurcharan’s family whereas Koel and Charu are her neighbors. As this scene flashes across Shekhar’s mind, he sings a song full of sadness and loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. A rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar, spends his days playing the music of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] or [[Elvis Presley]] and composing his own songs with Lalita, rather than becoming part of his shrewd father's world of profit and business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantia ([[Diya Mirza]]), the beautiful but, devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry into. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Koel’s house. Girish seems smitten by Lalita whereas Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lalita’s close friendship with Girish.

One day, a shocked Lalita, who’s employed at the Rai’s office, realizes of a hotel project from Gurcharan’s ancestral ''haveli'' (palatial house). On an earlier occasion, Gurcharan had borrowed money from Navin Rai after putting his ''haveli'' on mortage. She understands that if the money is not be repayed in a few months, Navin Rai would take over the property. She immediately thinks of asking Shekhar for monetary help. Unforeseen circumstances prevent this and Girish upon realizing this, alleviates their problem by making Gurcharan his business partner. Gurcharan repays the debt and the turn of events prompts Shekhar to think why Lalita chose to ask Girish for money instead of him. On one auspicious night, Shekhar and Lalita apparently get married without anyone’s knowledge. 

[[Image:Parineeta 3.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Shekhar confronting his father about Lalita, his wife]]While Shekhar is off to [[Darjeeling]] on a business trip, Navin Rai violently thunders on Lalita about the loss of his hotel project embarrassing and humiliating her. Rai gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolizing the end of their association. Gurcharan unable to digest this faces a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Rai informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is digusted to hear of the marriage and in the anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. In the meanwhile, Girish assists the Gurcharan family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s ''haveli''. With a shock, Shekhar realizes that Lalita denied Girish's marriage proposal and thereby he married Koel. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families.

=== The key elements ===
Prior to [[Parineeta (2005 film)|Parineeta]], [[Pradeep Sarkar]] was a well-known personality in the area of [[advertisement]]s. With 17 years in mainstream advertising and 7 years of advertisement film-making and commercial cinema, he completed about 1000 [[Television advertisement|commercials]] and 15 music videos <ref name="pradeepintro">{{cite news|accessdate=2007-10-22|url=http://www.movietalkies.com/artists/complete-profie.asp?ArtistId=44267
|title=Pradeep Sarkar profile}}</ref>. [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]], the film's producer, took notice of his music videos and contacted Sarkar to direct some of the music videos of the film, [[Mission Kashmir]] (2000) <ref name="ref2">{{cite web|work=Hindu.com|title=A debut at 52!|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/08/18/stories/2007081851940600.htm}}</ref>. After carving a niche in filming music videos, Sarkar gave the thought of filming ''Parineeta'' to Chopra <ref name="ref2">{{cite web|work=Hindu.com|title=A debut at 52!|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/08/18/stories/2007081851940600.htm}}</ref>. There began the making of the film. 

About the film's comparison with the novel, Chopra said in an interview that, as compared to its [[Parineeta (1953 film)|1953 namesake film]] by Bimal Roy, the film's story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them one and a half years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasizing under-represented characters from the novel <ref name="chopra1">{{cite web|work=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-10-22|first=Tanmaya Kumar|last=Nanda|title='Judge me by the highest standards'|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/10chopra.htm}}</ref><ref name="chopra2">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-22|first=Anuj|last=Kumar|work=Hindu.com|title=A maverick, period!|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2005061001970400.htm&date=2005/06/10/&prd=fr&}}</ref>. In a separate interview, Chopra said that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. He gave due credit to Sarkar and the film's [[cinematography|cinematographer]], [[Natarajan Subramaniam]] for the visuals of the movie <ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title= "Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref>. Chopra cited an interesting anecdote about his belief in Sarkar's film making abilities. He said that he never personally signed the [[cheques]] for the film's expenditure. He transferred money into Sarkar's bank account and the cheques were eventually signed by Sarkar and his spouse <ref name="chopra1">{{cite web|work=Rediff.com|title='Judge me by the highest standards'|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/10chopra.htm}}</ref>. In an interview given by [[Saif Ali Khan]] who portrayed ''Shekhar'' in the film, he said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. However, with the film's crew not finding the depiction apt, they began filming the movie with a ''60's'' look <ref name="refsaif">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-22|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/saif-ali-khan.html|title=Saif Ali Khan spills Parineeta secrets!|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref>.

=== Casting ===
Chopra said in an interview that [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Vidya Balan]] were not the first choices for the lead roles in ''Parineeta'' <ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title="Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref>.

He instead hoped to work with established actresses like [[Aishwarya Rai]] or [[Rani Mukherjee]]. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of ''Lalita'', he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance <ref name="refsaif">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/saif-ali-khan.html|title=Saif Ali Khan spills Parineeta secrets!|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref>.

[[Image:Greencar.jpg|thumb|right|Shekhar and his friend in the green car]]The choice of [[Sanjay Dutt]] was because of his versatality, said Chopra in an interview. He also said that the affable nature of Sanjay was a plus during the film making <ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title="Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref>.

=== Filming and music ===

[[Image:Parineeta The Film.JPG|180px|thumb|right|Shekhar ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) playing the piano while Lalita ([[Vidya Balan]]) sings "[[Piyu Bole]]".]]With Sarkar knowing the city of [[Kolkata]] very well, the film was primarily shot there <ref name="kolkata">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-24|first=Rohini|last=Bhandari|url=http://www.businessofcinema.com/boc/?file=story&id=5367|title=Interview - Pradeep Sarkar|work=Businessofcinema.com}}</ref>. Re-creating the movie sets back to the 60s era required a lot from the film's crew. Chopra said that it costed them money and difficulty to procure the green colored car which was driven by Shekhar and his friend in the film. Chopra even confirms the authenticity of the piano used in the song, ''[[Piyu Bole]]'', to be of that era. <ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title="Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref>.

=== Reviews, critiques and controversies ===
Released on [[June 10]], [[2005]], one of the critics went to say that the film wasn't tipped to do much at the box office given that the novella wasn't not one of the author, [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]'s lavish creations. Citing comparisons with the [[Parineeta (1953 film)|1953 version]], the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray ''Lalita's'' character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporaries, Sanjay Dutt and Saif Ali Khan, and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments for the film to be a successful adaptation.<ref name="bollywoodcritics">{{cite news|accessdate=2007-10-27|url=http://www.bollywood.com/archives/2005/06/parineeta_could.html
