'''Kaziranga National Park''' is situated on the south bank of the [[Brahmaputra]] river in [[Assam]], [[India]]. It is famous as a refuge for the Indian or [[one-horned rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis''). Stretching over an area of 430 km², Kaziranga is one of the last refuges of the Indian rhino. The national park is a vast stretch of coarse, tall [[elephant grass]], [[marshland]] and dense [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]]. The Park celebrates its centenary in [[2005]].

Kaziranga reserve was created to preserve Indian rhinocerous numbers, it was established as a proposed forest reserve on [[June 1]], [[1905]], and Kaziranga was declared a reserve forest in [[1908]] by the British and was officially closed for shooting in [[1926]]. In [[1938]] the Park was opened to visitors. In [[1950]] the area was declared a [[wildlife sanctuary]], in [[1954]], the rhino was given legal protection through the Assam (Rhinoceros) Bill that laid down heavy penalties for killing it. In [[1974]] Kaziranga was designated a [[national park]], the first national park in Assam. Bounded by the misty blue hills of Barail and [[Karbi Anglong]] to the south, the national park was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in [[1985]]. Today it holds the world's largest population of Indian rhinos, numbering more than one thousand.
