'''BenQ Corporation''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/bɛn kju:/}}; {{lang-zh|明基電通股份有限公司}})  is a [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]-based company specializing in the manufacturing of computing, communications, and consumer electronics devices.

The name reflects their corporate motto or vision:
'''B'''ringing '''E'''njoyment a'''n'''d '''Q'''uality to life.

The company was established in 1984, initially known as [[Acer Peripherals Inc.]], then [[Acer (company)|Acer]] CM (Communications and Multimedia), and finally rebranded as BenQ<ref>http://www.benq.com/page/?pageId=6</ref> in [[December 2001]]. 

BenQ manufactures technology products, including communication and personal computer related products. Its principal products include [[TFT LCD]] monitors and televisions, [[scanners]] and [[Computer printer|printers]], [[digital cameras]], projectors, [[laptop]]s, [[computer keyboard]]s, [[mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[mobile phone]]s.

The head office is located in [[Taoyuan]], [[Taiwan]], and the company operates worldwide. BenQ owns and operates branch offices in key markets, and employ over 13,000+ individuals. Three business groups manage BenQ's product lines: Mobile Communications Business Group, Digital Media Business Group and Integrated Manufacturing and Services Business Group.  

On [[October 1]], [[2005]], BenQ acquired the mobile devices division of [[Germany]]'s [[Siemens AG]], becoming the 6th largest company in the mobile phone industry by accumulated market share.  The acquisition results in a new business group, [[BenQ-Siemens|BenQ Mobile]], of BenQ Corporation entirely dedicated to wireless communications. Mobile phones of the new group are marketed under a new brand, BenQ-Siemens.

On [[August 24]], [[2006]] BenQ announced plans to spin-off its manufacturing operations in early 2007, separating contract manufacturing and own-brand divisions.      

In late [[September]] [[2006]], the mobile devices division BenQ Mobile ([[Germany]]) announced bankruptcy. BenQ faced criticism from German politicians and its own employees.

BenQ Corporation is part of the BenQ Group, which also includes [[AU Optronics]].
