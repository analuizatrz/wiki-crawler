'''"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"''' is an episode in the eighth season of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', featuring fictional [[pilot episode|pilot episodes]] from non-existent [[television series]] derived from ''The Simpsons''. The episode is a parody of the tendency of network executives to try to find any reason to [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] characters from a hit series.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
[[Troy McClure]] hosts a television special introducing three television shows produced using ''Simpsons'' characters. The gimmick of the special is that the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX network]], faced with a schedule with only three filled slots (''The Simpsons'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]''), commissions the producers of ''The Simpsons'' to produce 35 different series. The producers end up churning out three. None of these shows exist in real life.

===Chief Wiggum, P.I.===
[[Clancy Wiggum]] and his son [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] move to [[New Orleans]] with [[Seymour Skinner]] (AKA 'Skinny Boy', a former resident of the city) as Clancy's sidekick, in what is supposedly a dark police drama. When Ralph is kidnapped by Clancy's new nemesis, Big Daddy, Clancy tracks Big Daddy down and saves Ralph, but ultimately lets the villain escape, feeling he will meet him again the following week. The Simpson family makes a guest appearance while celebrating [[Mardi Gras]].

===The Love-matic Grampa===
The next clip is from an odd [[sitcom]]-style comedy about the bartender [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s love life. Moe receives advice from the [[ghost]] of [[Abraham Simpson]], who was crushed by a falling shelf in a store and subsequently got lost on his way up to Heaven and possesses Moe's Love Tester machine, a la ''[[My Mother, the Car]]''. Moe gets a date, but his dependence on the machine is revealed, and he confesses to receiving advice. His date is actually happy when she hears this, flattered that Moe would go to all that trouble for her. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] makes a guest appearance when he visits the bar.

===The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour===
Homer, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] appear in a [[comedy]] show featuring various [[songs]] and skits. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] refuses to participate, but is replaced by an attractive [[blonde]] [[prom]] queen. This segment is a [[parody]] of ''[[The Brady Bunch#The Brady Bunch Variety Hour|The Brady Bunch Variety Hour]]'', an infamous short-lived spinoff of the 1970s sitcom, considered one of the worst shows of all time. [[Tim Conway]] guest stars.

Troy McClure ends the special with a look at the upcoming season of ''The Simpsons'', filled with blatantly ridiculous plot twists such as Homer turning Lisa into a frog using [[magical|magic powers]], the discovery of Bart's two long lost identical brothers, [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]] marrying [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], [[Bumblebee Man]], and [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy]], and Homer meeting an alien named [[The Great Gazoo|Ozmodiar]] that only he can see.

*Many of the producers, notably [[Matt Groening]], were uneasy about this episode, feeling that its intentionally bad writing and plots would be mistranslated as actual bad sitcom writing. He also didn't like the idea of breaking the fourth wall and saying that in "reality" the Simpsons were not a family and just a bunch of actors. This issue wasn't really addressed in this episode, but the viewers are left with the impression that they are a family. In the Season 11 episode "[[Behind the Laughter]]", the fourth wall is broken again, but the Simpsons are portrayed as a family that goes into acting together.

*This episode has since proved very controversial, with some loving it, such as ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' which put the episode in its Top 25 Simpsons episode list, while others disliked the intentionally bad writing and simply call it a bad episode. 

*[[Yeardley Smith]], the voice of Lisa, has only one line in this episode (not counting her giggle as she removes her Mardi Gras outfit).

*This was the first non-Halloween episode to have 3 separate stories, although "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]" had over a dozen storylines.

* The title of the Wiggum segment is an obvious spoof of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', but may have been inspired by the ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' spinoff ''[[Beverly Hills Buntz]]'', which similarly featured a single law enforcement character from a popular show transplanted to a completely different city to become a detective. The segment goes on to parody ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', ''[[Miami Vice]]'' and ''[[Baywatch Nights]]''.
* Moe's segment has a ''[[Bewitched]]''/''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' feel to it, as well as ''[[My Mother the Car]]''. The first moments of the segment parody ''[[Cheers]]'', but it quickly swings away from that. 
* Skinner can be seen talking to a look-alike of [[Huggy Bear]] of ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]'' fame.
* The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of [[Jan Brady]] in the ''[[Brady Bunch Variety Hour]]'' when [[Eve Plumb]] refused to participate.
* On the commentary, the producers cited several shows parodied during the variety show, including ''[[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[Laugh In]]''.
* Ozmodiar is a spoof of [[the Great Gazoo]] from ''[[The Flintstones]]''.
* The songs parodied during the third segment are:
**"I Want Candy" by [[The Strangeloves]]
**"[[Peppermint Twist]]" by Joey Dee and the Starlighters
**"[[Whip It]]" by [[Devo]]
**"Lollipop" by [[The Chordettes]]
*The Lovematic-Grandpa machine sings ''Daisy Daisy'' in a distorted manner when its electrical circuits are failing, spoofing [[HAL 9000|HAL]] from the [[1968 in film|1968 film]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.
