'''Omar Ahmed Khadr''' ([[September 19]] [[1986]] - ) is the 4<sup>th</sup> child in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Khadr family]]. He has been imprisoned in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s since he was captured at the age of 15 following a 2002 firefight between American troops and militants in Afghanistan. He is accused of throwing a grenade that killed a US soldier, leading to charges of war crimes and providing support to terrorism.<ref name=DoDList2>[http://www.dod.mil/news/May2006/d20060515%20List.pdf list of prisoners (.pdf)], ''[[US Department of Defense]]'', [[May 15]] [[2006]]</ref> 

Born in Toronto, his case has drawn considerable attention as a [[child soldier]] who is the youngest prisoner held in [[extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial detention]] by the United States to face charges in the [[War on Terror]]. The only Western citizen remaining in Guantanamo, Khadr is unique in that Canada has refused to seek [[extradition]] or [[repatriation]].

On [[2007-06-04]], a military court dismissed all charges against Khadr because the tribunal was only authorised to charge ''illegal'' enemy combatants, but Khadr and others had only be labelled as "enemy combatants" with no judgment on their legality, during their administrative processing.<ref name=MiamiHerald20070604>

In February 2008, the Pentagon accidentally released evidence that revealed that although Khadr was present during the firefight, there was no other evidence that he had thrown the grenade. After his comrade was killed, a wounded Khadr, on his knees, was shot twice in the back before being captured.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/02/05/khadr-account.html?ref=rss New witness account shows Khadr charges should be dropped: lawyers]</ref>

In [[1992]], Khadr's father stepped on a land-mine while in [[Lowgar Province|Lowgar, Afghanistan]] and nearly died; the Khadr family moved back to Toronto so he could recuperate. Once the family moved back to Toronto, Omar became "hypersensitive to tension in the family" and would often quote [[Captain Haddock]] from [[The Adventures of Tintin]].<ref name="unending" /> Enrolled at [[ISNA Elementary School]], Omar's teachers described him as "very smart, very eager and very polite".<ref name="unending" />
[[Image:Khadr Kids.png|thumb|left|An early photo of Khadr's mother and siblings.]]
Returning to Pakistan with his family, Ahmed was arrested in 1995 after it was discovered that a [[Sudanese]] man staying with the family had purchased one of the vehicles used in [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]]'s bombing of the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan.<ref name="unending" /><ref name="ClarkeTestimony">[http://banking.senate.gov/_files/clarke.pdf Statement of] [[Richard A.

[[Image:Khadr Zoo.png|thumb|Khadr at the [[Metro Toronto Zoo]].]]
Khadr's father moved his family to [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan]] in [[1997]], where they lived in their father's [[NGO]] office. During their stay, the family visited the compound of [[Osama Bin Laden]], whom Ahmed had befriended during the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]] in the 1980s, on occasion and the children of the two families played together.<ref name="SonofAlQaeda">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/khadr/ Son of Al Qaeda], ''[[Frontline (PBS)]]''</ref>  Described as one of Bin Laden's senior lieutenants, the father moved his family into Bin Laden's compound after the leader had abandoned it.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]], the United States retaliated by [[Operation Infinite Reach#Attack on camps in Afghanistan|bombing camps in Afghanistan]]. Thus, expecting a similar retaliation following the [[9/11|September 11th attacks]] in 2001, the 14-year old Omar followed his father into the mountains, where he washed laundry and cooked meals for the group of militants.<ref name="unending" />

According to a 2007 charge sheet released by [[Susan Crawford (Pentagon)|Susan J. Crawford]], the convener of the Guantanamo Military Commissions, Khadr received "one-on-one" weapons training with an unnamed al-Qaeda member nine months after heading into the mountains.<ref>[[CBS News]], [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/24/terror/main2723020.shtml Murder Charges For Canadian Gitmo Inmate], April 24, 2007</ref>

==The Firefight and Capture==
[[Image:Alleged Khadr 3.png|thumb|275px|A youth alleged to be Khadr, serving with Afghan insurgents.]]
The 15-year old Khadr was captured following a four-hour<ref name="cbc" /> firefight in the village of [[Ab Khail]]. It was considered the first major engagement since [[Operation Anaconda]] had ended four months earlier.<ref name="purple" /> 

According to his brother [[Abdurrahman Khadr]], Omar had been sent to accompany three of the men visiting the residence, to serve as a translator for the gathered Mujahideen at his father's request - since he was fluent in the local [[Pashto]] dialect, as well as Arabic and English. He had previously been asked to serve as a translator for [[Abu Laith al-Libi]].<ref name="thestar" /> His involvement as a translator was against his mother's wishes, and she wasn't aware he had been sent out that day.<ref name=LATimes20070623/><ref>[[CBS News]], [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/16/60minutes/main3516048_page2.shtml Omar Khadr: The Youngest Terrorist?]</ref>

From approximately February 2002, a team of American soldiers were using [[Khost Airfield|the abandoned Soviet airbase]] in [[Khost, Afghanistan]] as an intelligence-gathering outpost, as they tried to blend in and gain the trust of the local community.<ref name="thestar">Shephard, Michelle. [[Toronto Star]]. [http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/208502 Khadr goes on trial], April 29, 2007</ref>

In the early morning of [[July 27]] 2002, a team comprised of American Special Forces, the [[505th Infantry Regiment (United States)|505th Infantry Regiment]]<ref name="dustoff">Dustoff Newsletter, [http://www.dustoff.org/newsletter/Fall-winter02/article-two.htm Rescue of the Year], 2002</ref>  and a "militia", comprised of hundreds of Afghan fighters loyal to mercenary warlord [[Pacha Khan Zadran]] and led by Zadran's brother Kamal,<ref>Baldauf, Scott. [[Christian Science Monitor]], [http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0729/p01s01-wosc.html Firefight shows strong al-Qaeda persistence], July 29, 2002</ref><ref name="goodson" /> had been sent from the airbase to the home of an elderly wheelchair-bound man believed to be a bomb-maker.<ref name="thestar" /> The search turned up no evidence against the man.<ref name="worth" /> 

While at the house, a report came in that a certain monitored [[satellite phone]] had just been used 600 metres<ref name="goodson">Vincent, Isabel. [[National Post]], "[http://www.nationalpost.com/home/story.html?id={35363D34-2294-4F73-96E9-7C568725623E} The Good Son]", December 28, 2002.</ref> from the group's present location. Six soldiers were sent to investigate the site of the phonecall.<ref name="thestar" />

The group consisted of [[Executive Officer|XO]] Captain Mike Silver, Sgt [[Christopher Speer]] from [[Delta Force]], [[Layne Morris]] and Master Sgt. Scotty Hansen, both from the [[19th Special Forces Group (United States)|19th Special Forces Group]] and two others.<ref name="thestar" />

Arriving at a series of [[mud hut]]s surrounded by a 10-foot<ref name="fay" /> stone wall with a green metal gate<ref name="easy">Bravin, Jess. [[Wall Street Journal]]. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06352/747086-84.stm At Guantanamo, even 'easy' cases have lingered], December 18, 2006</ref> approximately 100 metres radius from the main hut, the Special Forces team saw children playing around the huts.<ref name="worth" /> 

Seeing five "well-dressed"<ref name="easy" /> men sitting around a fire in the main residence, with [[AK-47]] rifles visible in the room, Morris approached and told the occupants to open the front door. "They looked at me and I looked at them," he later remembered.<ref name="easy" /> When he was ignored, he retreated and the six Americans took up a position around the complex and waited 45 minutes while Morris called for support.<ref name="goodson" /> During this time, a crowd of approximately 100 local Afghans had gathered around the area to watch the incident unfold.<ref name="easy" />

Once the reinforcements arrived, two of Zadran's militiamen were sent into the compound to speak with the inhabitants. They returned to the Americans' position and reported that the men inside claimed to be [[Pashtun]] villagers. They were told to return to the huts, and inform the occupants that the Americans wanted to search their house regardless of their affiliation.<ref name="voa">Drudge, Michael. [[VOA News]], [[s:Ab Khail VOA Report|Afghanistan/Combat]], August 1 2002</ref> Upon hearing this, the occupants of the hut opened fire, shooting both militiamen.<ref>Note: The translators are varyingly described as "wounded" or "killed" by the opening fire</ref><ref name="worth">[[Andy Worthington|Worthington, Andy]]. [http://www.nthposition.com/thetrialsofomarkhadr.php The trials of Omar Khadr, Guant√°namo's "child soldier"], November 7 2007.</ref>  At this point, Hansen and another soldier then ran forward and dragged the two militiamen away - an action that would see Hansen awarded a [[Bronze Star]] after the battle.<ref name="thestar" />

Several women immediately fled the huts and ran away while the occupants began throwing grenades at the American troops, with intermittent rifle fire. 

Morris and Silver had now taken up positions outside the stone wall, with Silver "over Morris's left shoulder explaining where he should try to position his next shot"<ref name="thestar" /> when Morris fell back into Silver, with a cut above his right eye and shrapnel embedded in his nose. "I thought his weapon had malfunctioned, that was my first thought," was Silver's recollection of the wound later attributed to an unseen grenade.<ref name="thestar" />

Morris was dragged a safe distance from the action, and was shortly after joined by Spc. Michael Rewakowski, Pfc. Brian Worth and Spc. Christopher Vedvick all of the 3rd Platoon of Company B of the 1st Battalion of the 505th.<ref name="fay">[[Fayetteville Observer]], [http://www.fayettevillenc.com/obj_stories/2002/aug/m01bragg.shtml story on firefight], August 3, 2002</ref> who had also been wounded by the grenade attacks.<ref name="purple">Schult, Ann Marie.

At 0910 a request for [[MedEvac]] was sent to the [[57th Medical Detachment]]. Ten minutes later, ''DUSTOFF 36'' and ''Wings 11'', a pair of [[UH-60]]s, were deployed as well as [[AH-64 Apache]]s ''Widowmaker 23'' and ''Widowmaker 26'' as escort. Arriving at the scene, the Apaches strafed the compound with cannon and rocket fire, while the medical helicopters remained 12 miles from the ongoing firefight.<ref name="dustoff" />  The helicopters finally landed at 1028 to load the wounded, as a pair of [[F-18 Hornet]]s dropped [[Mark 82 bomb]]s on the houses.<ref name="thestar" /><ref name="dustoff" /> Leaving the Apaches to continue attacking the house along with a pair of [[A-10 Warthog]]s that had just arrived on-scene, the MedEvac left for [[Bagram Airbase]], arriving at the hospital at 1130.<ref name="dustoff" />
[[Image:Khadr medic 2.png|thumb|250px|Two soldiers kneel over the wounded Khadr.]]
Unaware that Khadr and an unidentified Mujahideen had survived the bombing, Silver and Speer followed three Delta Force soldiers entered the compound's ruins,  picking their way over the carcasses of dead animals and three fighters.<ref name="thestar" />  

According to Silver's 2007 telling of the story, he then heard a sound "like a gunshot", and saw the three Delta Force soldiers duck - as a grenade flew past them and exploded near Speer, who was at the rear of the group.<ref name="thestar" /> Nobody had seen the origin of the grenade. In 2008, an accidentally-released written statement by one of Hansen's team stated that they had already begun taking "directed rifle fire" from a surviving Mujahideen before the grenade was thrown.<ref name="cbc">[[CBC News]], [http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/02/05/khadr-account.html?ref=rss New witness account shows Khadr charges should be dropped: lawyers], February 5, 2008</ref>
[[Image:Alleged Khadr 2.png|thumb|left|A youth, allegedly Khadr, smiling while burying landmines.]]
Silver initially claimed that ''two'' of the Delta Force troops then opened fire,<ref name="thestar" /> leading to Khadr, who was alleged to be holding a [[pistol]], being shot in the chest three times.<ref name="worth" /> Later reports suggested that only ''one'' soldier, identified as ''OC-1'' in documents, had opened fire. First shooting the wounded Mujahideen who had dropped his rifle and was struggling to move on the ground - OC-1 then saw Khadr crouched on his knees with his back to the soldiers, wounded by shrapnel that had just permenantly blinded his left eye,<ref name="worth" /> and shot him twice in the back.<ref name="cbc" />

After searching the remains of the collapsed compound, soldiers discovered a video which shows a youth alleged to be Khadr helping to assemble explosives along with al-Libi<ref name="thestar" /> and plant [[landmine]]s.<ref name="easy" /><ref>[[CBS News]], [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/16/60minutes/main3516048.shtml Omar Khadr: The Youngest Terrorist?, Was Only 15 Years Old When He Was Captured In Afghanistan]</ref>

==Time at Bagram==
The unconscious Khadr was airlifted to receive medical attention at Bagram, where interrogations began immediately after he gained consciousness. In a complaint lodged with [[Amnesty International]], Khadr states that he was refused pain medication for his wounds, that he had his hands tied above a door frame for hours, had cold water thrown on him, had a bag placed over his head and was threatened with military dogs. Unallowed to use washrooms, he was forced to urinate on himself.<ref name="amnesty">[[Amnesty International]], [http://www.amnesty.org/en/alfresco_asset/6e01555b-a2df-11dc-8d74-6f45f39984e5/amr511842005en.html Case File 14: Omar Khadr]</ref>

On [[30 August]] 2002, Canadian officials sent a diplomatic query to the United States requesting [[consulate|consular]] access to their citizen being held at Bagram. The request was denied ten days later, with a statement that Canada would be notified only if Canadian citizens were transferred to Guant√°namo Bay.<ref name="amnesty" />

He was interrogated again on [[September 17]], during which time he is alleged to have mentioned hearing vague reports that a [[bounty]] of $1500 had been offered for each American soldier killed in Afghanistan - but didn't know who was offering the reward. When asked how that made him feel at the time, the 15-year old stated "I wanted to kill a lot of American[s] to get lots of money".<ref name=GlobeAndMail20070712>

Defence attorney [[Nathan Whiting]] responded to the 2007 claims, stating that it was "hardly convincing for the U.S. to suggest that in the midst of this battle, and after the entire site had been flattened by 500-pound bombs and everyone else in the compound killed, Omar was lying under the rubble thinking about how to earn himself $1,500."<ref name=GlobeAndMail20070712 />

Khadr spent three months recuperating at Bagram. During that time he was often singled out for extensive labour by American soldiers who "made him work like a horse", referring to him as "Buckshot Bob" and calling him a murderer.<ref>[[Moazzam Begg|Begg, Moazzam]], ''Enemy Combatant''</ref>

==Time at Guantanamo==
He was transferred to [[Guantanamo Bay]] in October 2002 to face charges of terrorism and war crimes for his actions.

In addition to being charged with the murder of Speer, Khadr is also being accused of attempted murder, conspiracy, spying and "providing material support for terrorism".<ref name=Macleans20070425>

In the early spring of 2003, Khadr was told "Your life is in my hands" by a military interrogator, who spat on him, tore out some of his hair and threatened to send him to a country that would torture him more thoroughly, making specific reference to an Egyptian ''Askri raqm tisa'' ("Soldier Number Nine") who enjoyed raping prisoners.

==Combatant Status Review Tribunal== 
{{wikisource|Summary of Evidence for Combatant Status Review Tribunal - Khadr, Omar Ahmed}}The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the June 2004 [[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]] that the [[Bush administration]] was wrong to declare they could legally withhold all the protections of the [[Geneva Conventions]] to captives from [[the war on terror]] - and that [[due process]] must be followed. Consequently, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] instituted "[[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s". 
[[Image:CSRT notice read to a Guantanamo captive.jpg|thumb|Combatant Status Review Tribunal notice read to a Guantanamo captive.]]
The Tribunals were not themselves authorized to determine whether the captives were ''lawful combatants'' -- simply to determine whether or not the captives have already been correctly proven to match the administration's definition of an "[[enemy combatant]]". Participation by the captives was voluntary, and Khadr chose not to be involved in his tribunal, at the urging of his lawyers who had been unallowed to meet with him.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}.

On [[August 31]] 2004, a [[Summary of Evidence (CSRT)|Summary of Evidence memo]] was prepared for Khadr's [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]. The summary alleged that he had admitted he threw a [[hand grenade|grenade]] which killed a U.S. soldier, attended an [[Afghan training camp|al Qaida training camp]] in [[Kabul]] and worked as a translator for [[al Qaida]] to coordinate [[land mine]] missions. In addition, he was accused of helping to plant the landmines between Khost and [[Ghardez]], and having visited an airport near Khost to collect information on U.S. convoy movements.<ref name=CsrtSummaryOfEvidenceOmarAhmedKhadr>

His actual tribunal was convened a week later, on [[September 7]], as Panel #5 reviewed his status in the detainment camp. The tribunal concluded that Khadr was an "[[enemy combatant]]" and a one-page summary of conclusions was released on [[September 17]].

==Role of Canadian Government==
After their initial inquiry in August 2002, the Canadian government maintained a stance of refusing to request [[extradition]] or [[repatriation]] for their native-born citizen even though all other Western countries had successfully removed their citizens from the detention camp.

A 2002 press release from Foreign Minister [[Bill Graham]] stated:<ref name=TorStar247900>

"It is an unfortunate reality that juveniles are too often the victims in military actions and that many groups and countries actively recruit and use them in armed conflicts and in terrorist activities. Canada is working hard to eliminate these practices, but child soldiers still exist, in Afghanistan, and in other parts of the world."

However, the article then notes that Graham's office subsequently tried to fight concerns over Khadr's youth.<ref name=TorStar247900/>

In February 2003, Canadian Foreign Affairs intelligence officer [[Jim Gould]] and an official from the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] were allowed to interrogate Khadr themselves.<ref name=TorStar247900/>  The presence of Gould allowed the government to claim that the purpose of the visit was to "to ascertain Khadr's well-being", while his attorney [[Nate Whitling]] argued that "Foreign Affairs is suggesting that the visit was actually for (Khadr's) benefit, but this is not the case". His attorneys then sought a [[Federal Court of Canada|Federal Court]] [[injunction]] to prevent CSIS from interrogating their client in the future.<ref name="ctv01" />

Assistant Director of CSIS [[William Hooper (CSIS)|William Hooper]] assured the Canadian public this interrogation was not intended to secure intelligence for an American prosecution, but admitted that the information was all freely shared with his American captors - without securing any guarantees, such as foregoing potential [[death penalty]] charges.<ref name="ctv01">[[CTV News]], [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050409/Khadr_CSIS_050409?s_name=&no_ads= CSIS admits sharing Khadr info with U.S.: report], Apr. 9 2005</ref>

The report from the Canadian interrogation states that:<ref name=TorStar247900/>
{{quotation|"In a fit of anger, he tore off his shirt revealing extensive scarring on the upper torso and a cluster of smaller ones on the upper left side of his body and on the back of his left shoulder."}}

In January 2008,  the revised manual for Canadian Consular Officers included a list of locations where it was possible that Canadians in foreign custody would undergo torture. The United States was on the list, based on the belief that Canadians could face torture in Guantanamo Bay - where Khadr is the sole Canadian.<ref name=CtvTortureGuide20081017>

The [[open letter]] was signed by two former foreign affairs ministers and several sitting members of parliament.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

The letter acknowledges that the Khadr family has an unsympathetic reception in Canada: {{quotation|"We are aware that, setting aside any of Khadr's own actions, the notoriety of his family makes him unsympathetic in the eyes of some. But it is plainly unjust to punish the son for the sins of the fathers, or to deny a citizen the protection of his government because of the words or deeds of family members."}}

The [[Canadian Bar Association]] urged Canadian [[Prime Minister]] to repatriate Khadr to stand trial in the Canadian justice system.<ref name=NationalPost20070812>

Other legal experts outlined difficulties in trying Khadr in Canada.

== The Speer/Morris lawsuit ==
Sgt. Speer's widow, Tabitha, and Sgt. [[Layne Morris]] launched a join [[civil suit]] against the estate of [[Ahmed Said Khadr]] - claiming that the father's failure to control his son resulted in the loss of Speers' life and Morris' right eye.

Utah US District Judge Paul Cassell gaving his ruling on [[February 17]] 2006, awarding $102.6 million in triple damages in what he said likely marks the first time terrorist acts have resulted in civil liabilities.<ref name=SLTribune> [http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3522572 GI injured in Afghan war wins lawsuit: Unique case: Court awards default judgment to man blinded in one eye], ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', [[February 16]] [[2006]]</ref>

Under US law, one can't sue for damages that were caused by "acts of war".  Speer and Morris argue that Khadr was engaged in an act of terrorism, not an act of war.

An article published in the [[June 14]] [[2007]] ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' said that Morris and Speer's widow might collect funds via the [[U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]].<ref name=SaltLakeTribune20070514>
