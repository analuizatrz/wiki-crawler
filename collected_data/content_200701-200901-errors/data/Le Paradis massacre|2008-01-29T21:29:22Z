The '''Le Paradis massacre''' was an atrocity committed by members of the 14th Company, [[SS Division Totenkopf]] under the command of [[Hauptsturmführer]] [[Fritz Knochlein]] against 99 ''[[hors de combat]]'' members of the 2nd Battalion of the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]] on [[May 26]], [[1940]] during [[World War II]]. The incident took place as the [[British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was attempting to retreat through the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region during the [[Operation Dynamo|evacuation from Dunkirk]]. 

Soldiers of the Royal Norfolks were isolated from their regiment, and held out in a farmhouse against an attack by [[Waffen-SS]] forces in the village of Le Paradis. After running out of ammunition, the defendants surrendered to the German troops who led them across the road to a wall and machine-gunned them. Ninety-seven British troops died. Two survived with injuries and hid until being captured days later. The commander of the German [[SS]] unit who ordered the massacre, Fritz Knöchlein, was tracked down, convicted by a war-crimes court and executed in [[1949]]. 

==Background==
The German invasion of [[France]] through the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] commenced just after dawn on the [[10 May]], [[1940]]. Army Group A under the command of Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] fought its way through southern Belgium and north-eastern France. German forces pushed the [[French Army]] and the BEF to the [[Meuse river]] on [[12 May]], crossing it that evening.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/facts01.htm |title=The Battle of France  |accessdate=2007-12-19 |author=German Propaganda Archive |date= |work= |publisher=Calvin College}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germanwarmachine.com/campaigns/1940/battleoffrance1.htm |title=German Army Battles & Campaigns: Battle of France, 1940  |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Brown Online}}</ref>.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Viking |isbn=0670910821 | |pages=221-556}}</ref> From there, they rapidly advanced to the [[English Channel]] over the course of the next week. BEF units, including detached companies of the Royal Norfolks and [[Royal Scots]], were used by allied command in an attempt to slow the German advance in northern France to allow more time to evacuate troops from Dunkirk<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192805509| |pages=94-97 |chapter=Uneasy Allies}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/5/14/55627/2665 |title=1940: The Battle of France |accessdate=2007-12-19 |author= |date=May 14, 2002 |work= |publisher=Scoop}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dunkirk: From Disaster to Deliverance |last=Wilson |first=Patrick |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=158097046X | |pages=42-56 |chapter=Massacre at Le Paradis}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Viking |isbn=0670910821 |pages=221-556}}</ref>

===SS Division Totenkopf===
The men of SS Division Totenkopf had been strongly indoctrinated with the [[Nazi Party]] ideology by its commander [[Theodor Eicke]]. They had a fanatical loyalty to him and [[Germany]], along with an imbued hatred of [[Jews]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States of America]].<ref>{{cite book |title=SS-Totenkopf |last=Mann |first=Dr. Chris |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |isbn=0760310157| pages=85 |chapter=Blooding}}</ref> The men of Totenkopf fought recklessly throughout the campaign, suffering comparatively higher death rates that other German forces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LSCGxAunpDsC&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=totenkopf+moroccan&source=web&ots=A-Q5aOv_JK&sig=yMznmRFbYujBBb6ysB1XUbjzuK8 |title=The Waffen-SS |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Gordon Williamson |date=2004 |work= |publisher=Osprey Publishing| pages=24}}</ref>

The Battle of France was SS Division Totenkopf's first major engagement of World War II. They were part of the reserves of Army Group A, and were called to the front line on [[17 May]]. The unit was engaged in "mopping up" operations against Allied forces to the north and east of [[Cambrai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QYU4QJsUWLYC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=ss+totenkopf+france+cambrai&source=web&ots=-BuGYKl7eO&sig=78w8MoFmSWaeneAGjQmN17Nn430 |title=Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-1945  |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Charles W.

By the time the operation had finished in Cambrai, the first German units had reached the English Channel but the British counter-attacked under Major-General [[Giffard LeQuesne Martel|G. Le Q. Martel]] just west of [[Arras]], on [[21 May]]. The Totenkopf division suffered casualties of just under 100 men in repelling the assault.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-6.html |title=The Counter-Attack At Arras |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Major L.

Ellis |date= |work= |publisher=HyperWar Project}}</ref> The Totenkopf was then ordered to the town of [[Béthune]] by General [[Erich Hoepner]] and crossed the [[La Bassée]] river under British attack on [[24 May]]. However, the men were ordered to retreat the next day on direct orders from [[Adolf Hitler]], issued to preserve tanks for the upcoming campaign in Dunkirk and to allow the [[Luftwaffe]] the chance to attack Allied positions in the area.<ref>{{cite book |title=SS-Totenkopf |last=Mann |first=Dr. Chris |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |isbn=0760310157| |pages=80 |chapter=Blooding}}</ref> The men thus had to make the hazardous crossing again on the night of [[26 May]].

===Royal Norfolk Regiment===
The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolks, along with the 8th [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], were holding the Allied line at the villages of Riez du Vinage, Le Cornet Malo and Le Paradis with the battalion [[headquarters#Military_headquarters|headquarters]] based at Le Paradis. The battalions had been ordered to hold out for as long as possible against the Germans to give time for the [[BEF]] to evacuate from Dunkirk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norfolkbc.fsnet.co.uk/archive_collection/strips_farrow/mackillers_paradis.htm |title=Le Paradis Massacre |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Major John L. Raybould |date= |work=Britannia and Castle |publisher=Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Royal Norfolk, East Anglian and Royal Anglian Regimental Associations}}</ref>

The SS Division Totenkopf emerged from the Bois de Paqueaut wood and attacked Le Cornet Malo at dawn, on the [[27 May]]. The British troops defended stubbornly but were eventually overrun, the attack resulting in the deaths of four German officers and one hundred and fifty men. Another 480 and 18 officers were wounded. Later the same day the German troops moved forward to attack Le Paradis.<ref>{{cite book |title=SS-Totenkopf |last=Mann |first=Dr. Chris |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |isbn=0760310157| |pages=80-83 |chapter=Blooding}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192805509| |pages=285-288 |chapter=Surrounded at Le Paradis}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ritterkreuztraeger-1939-45.de/Waffen-SS/K/Knoechlein-Fritz.htm |title=Ritterkreuzträger Fritz Knöchlein |accessdate=2007-12-20 |author=Uwe Schweisfurth |date= |work= |publisher=Uwe Schweisfurth |language=German}}</ref>

==Battle of Le Paradis==
[[Image:FritzKnoechlein.jpg|thumb|Fritz Knöchlein pictured on [[May 27]] [[1941]]]]
After the engagement at Le Cornet Malo, C [[company (military unit)|company]] and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen back to their headquarters at Cornet Farm just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/pooleys_revenge.htm |title=Private Pooley's Revenge |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Stephen Stratford |date= |work= |publisher=Stephen Stratford}}</ref> They therefore dug in around the farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis road, the boundary between the Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st [[Royal Scots]]. The Norfolk's last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite no support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment, until 17:15 when they ran out of ammunition.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192805509| |pages=2888-289 |chapter=Surrounded at Le Paradis}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ritterkreuztraeger-1939-45.de/Waffen-SS/K/Knoechlein-Fritz.htm |title=Ritterkreuzträger Fritz Knöchlein |accessdate=2007-12-20 |author=Uwe Schweisfurth |date= |work= |publisher=Uwe Schweisfurth |language=German}}</ref> During the battle the Germans had attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks, and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192805509| |pages=288-289 |chapter=Surrounded at Le Paradis}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ritterkreuztraeger-1939-45.de/Waffen-SS/K/Knoechlein-Fritz.htm |title=Ritterkreuzträger Fritz Knöchlein |accessdate=2007-12-20 |author=Uwe Schweisfurth |date= |work= |publisher=Uwe Schweisfurth |language=German}}</ref>

The 99 surviving defenders of the 2nd Norfolks were eventually ordered to surrender by their commander Major Lisle Ryder, and they left the cowshed in which they had been defending under a white flag.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ritterkreuztraeger-1939-45.de/Waffen-SS/K/Knoechlein-Fritz.htm |title=Ritterkreuzträger Fritz Knöchlein |accessdate=2007-12-20 |author=Uwe Schweisfurth |date= |work= |publisher=Uwe Schweisfurth |language=German}}</ref> Due to the boundary between the two British regiments being the road, Ryder's men surrendered to SS Hauptsturmführer Fritz Knöchlein and his company, who had been fighting the Royal Scots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/pooleys_revenge.htm |title=Private Pooley's Revenge |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Stephen Stratford |date= |work= |publisher=Stephen Stratford}}</ref> Recent evidence suggests that around twenty men of the Royal Scots who surrended to a SS unit may also have been murdered.<ref>{{cite news |last=Picken |authorlink= |title=Book reveals Nazi massacre of 21 Royal Scots |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=911672007 |work= |publisher=Edinburgh Evening News |date=11 June 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref>

===Massacre===
The British captives, a majority of whom were wounded, were disarmed and marched down a road off the Rue du Paradis. While they were waiting two machine-guns from No.4 Machine-gun Company were prepared and set up by a barn in a paddock of the farm.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192805509| |pages=285-288 |chapter=Massacre at Le Paradis}}</ref> The British prisoners were marched to the barn, lined up alongside it and fired upon by the two German machinegunners, who continued firing until all the British had fallen. Knöchlein then armed his men with bayonets and they finished off any remaining survivors. Satisfied that they had killed them all, the German soldiers left to rejoin the rest of their regiment.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cooper |authorlink= |title=Le Paradis: The murder of 97 soldiers in a French field on the 26/27th May 1940 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/83/a2328383.html |work= |publisher=BBC |date=22 February 2004 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Vengeance of Private Pooley |year=1957 |publisher=William Heineman Ltd |isbn=095077331X |pages=104-119}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QYU4QJsUWLYC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=ss+totenkopf+france+cambrai&source=web&ots=-BuGYKl7eO&sig=78w8MoFmSWaeneAGjQmN17Nn430 |title=Hitlers Heerführer: Die deutschen Oberbefehlshaber |accessdate=2007-12-21 |author=Johannes Hürter |date=2007 |work= |publisher=OldenbourgWissenschaftsverlag |pages=189| language=German}}</ref>

[[Image:LeParadisFarmhouse.jpg|thumb|The farmhouse where the survivors of the Royal Norfolks surrended]]
An account by Private Albert Pooley; one of only two survivors:

<blockquote>... we turned off the dusty French road, through a gateway and into a meadow beside the buildlings of a farm. I saw with one of the nastiest feelings I have ever had in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.'<ref>{{cite book |title=SS-Totenkopf |last=Mann |first=Dr. Chris |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |isbn=0760310157| |pages=84-85 |chapter=Blooding}}</ref></blockquote>

In total, 97 British prisoners were killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. However, despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty for three days and nights, surviving on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the [[Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht's]] 251st Infantry Division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres.html |title=Massacres and Atrocities of World War II: Le Paradis |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=George Duncan |date= |work= |publisher=George Duncan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ritterkreuztraeger-1939-45.de/Waffen-SS/K/Knoechlein-Fritz.htm |title=Ritterkreuzträger Fritz Knöchlein |accessdate=2007-12-20 |author=Uwe Schweisfurth |date= |work= |publisher=Uwe Schweisfurth |language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Viking |isbn=0670910821 |pages=311-379}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
On the day after the massacre, the [[28 May]], Gunter d'Alquen, a journalist in the [[Waffen-SS]] arrived at the scene with Dr Thum, the SS-Totenkopf deputy legal advisor. d'Alquen made a report of what he saw:

<blockquote>It was possible to look into the back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had come to the conclusion that a summary trial had taken place.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192805509| |pages=301-302 |chapter=Massacre at Le Paradis}}</ref></blockquote>

Another report was made by Major Friedkerr von Riedner, who was also at the scene of the massacre on that day.

<blockquote>These people had almost all suffered head wounds from shots that must have been fired at close range. Some had their whole skull smashed in, an injury that can almost only be caused by a blow from a gun butt or similar means. <ref>{{cite book |title=Dunkirk: From Disaster to Deliverance |last=Wilson |first=Patrick |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=158097046X | |pages=73 |chapter=Massacre at Le Paradis}}</ref></blockquote>

News of the massacre spread to neighbouring German divisions, eventually reaching General [[Hoepner]], commander of the German forces in France. He disliked the SS, especially [[Theodor Eicke|Eicke]], and was determined to have him dismissed if charges of mistreatment or murdering of prisoners could be brought. However none of these investigations were ever successful, possibly because Knöchlein stated that the British had been using [[dumdum]] bullets, thus violating the [[Hague Convention of 1899]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 |last=Jackson |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192805509| |pages=285-288 |chapter=Surrounded at Le paradis}}</ref> Even many SS officers were appalled by the massacre, some reportedly even challenged Knöchlein to a duel, although none was ever fought.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-KEtPlNQJNgC&pg=RA1-PA76&lpg=RA1-PA76&dq=le+paradis+massacre&source=web&ots=dV4NIMNPqY&sig=uLY5aSFyv8TbUB3Hf_xS5n2LG0Y#PRA1-PA77,M1 |title=The Waffen SS |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=George H. Stein |date=1966 |work= |publisher=Cornell University Press| pages=76}}</ref> 

The Allies received no information about the massacre until the summer of [[1943]], when Pooley, who had spent the last three years in a German hospital due to the injuries he had suffered in the massacre, was declared medically unfit and repatriated. However, Pooley's story was not believed on his arrival by the British authorities; it was not thought that the German army were capable of such atrocities against British troops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norfolkbc.fsnet.co.uk/archive_collection/strips_farrow/mackillers_paradis.htm |title=Le Paradis Massacre |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Major John L. Raybould |date= |work=Britannia and Castle |publisher=Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Royal Norfolk, East Anglian and Royal Anglian Regimental Associations}}</ref> Private O'Callaghan did not return to the [[United Kingdom]] until [[1945]] after the liberation of his [[prisoner-of-war camp]]. He confirmed Pooley's story, which  prompted an official investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norfolkbc.fsnet.co.uk/archive_collection/strips_farrow/mackillers_paradis.htm |title=Le Paradis Massacre |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Major John L.

The bodies of those killed in the massacre were exhumed in [[1942]] by the French, but only about fifty of the 97 remains were successfully identified. The bodies were then reburied in Le Paradis churchyard, which now forms part of the Le Paradis War Cemetery administered by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/cemetery_details.aspx?cemetery=2027400&mode=1 |title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission: Le Paradis |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission}}</ref> In [[1970]], a memorial plaque was placed on the barn wall where the massacre took place and a large memorial was subequently erected beside the church.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Regiments/RoyalNorfolkMassacreWordlWar2.html |title=Massacre of Royal Norfolk Soldiers At Le Paradis |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=War Memorials Trust}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Babbington |authorlink= |title=Wartime massacre commemorated by Dunkirk veterans |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article275689.ece |work= |publisher=The Independent |date=03 June 2000 |accessdate=2007-12-12 }}</ref>

==Trial of Knöchlein==
{{see|Fritz Knöchlein}}
After the war, the evidence of O'Callaghan and the discovery of the [[SS]]-run [[extermination camps]] prompted the British authorities to look into the reports. The massacre was investigated by the War Crimes Investigation Unit and after Knöchlein's company was identified as the perpertrators in [[1947]], he was traced and arrested in [[Germany]].<ref name=Statford>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/pooleys_revenge.htm |title=Private Pooley's Revenge |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Stephen Stratford |date= |work= |publisher=Stephen Stratford}}</ref> Knöchlein was arraigned on charges of [[war crimes]] in August 1948; to which he pleaded not guilty: 

[[Image:KnochleinTrial.jpg|thumb|O'Callaghan and Pooley in Hamburg during the trial]]

<blockquote>The accused Fritz Knöchlein, a German national, in the charge of the Hamburg Garrison Unit, pursuant to Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals, is charged with committing a war crime in that he in the vicinity of Paradis, Pas-de-Calais, France, on or about 27 May 1940, in violation of the laws and usages of war, was concerned in the killing of about ninety prisoners-of-war, members of The Royal Norfolk Regiment and other British Units.<ref name=Statford/></blockquote>

He was tried before Curiohaus war crimes court in [[Altona, Hamburg]], in Court Number 5 on Monday, [[11 October]], [[1948]]. Knöchlein's defence hinged on the claim that he was not present at the massacre, although his lawyers did not deny that the event took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and [[White Flag|misused a flag of truce]]; all of which was vigorously denied by the prosecution.<ref name=Statford/> Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognizing Knöchlein.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Vengeance of Private Pooley |last=Jolly |first=Cyril |authorlink= |year=1957 |publisher=William Heineman Ltd |isbn=095077331X | pages=167-198 |chapter= }}</ref> 

On the twelfth day of the trial, during his summation, the Judge-Advocate said that whether the British had used illegal ammunition or abused a flag of truce was irrelevant; the German troops still had absolutely no right to execute prisoners of war without a fair and proper trial. On [[25 October]] at 11:30, the verdict was read out by the President of the court. This asserted that the defendant, Fritz Knöchlein, had been found guilty of war crimes. His lawyer, Dr. Uhde, made the following plea to the court for clemency on account of Knöchlein's wife and family, who had attended every day of the trial.

<blockquote>All that is left for me to say is that some little doubt may have remained in the minds of the Court which will enable the members not to award the extreme penalty. Spare the life of the accused. He has a wife and four children who are dependent upon him for support. Consider also the fact that he is a soldier, and the Court is composed of members of the British Army. I believe I am entitled to appeal to the Court to pronounce a sentence which will enable my client to come out of prison at an early date. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norfolkbc.fsnet.co.uk/archive_collection/strips_farrow/mackillers_paradis.htm |title=Le Paradis Massacre |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Major John L. Raybould |date= |work=Britannia and Castle |publisher=Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Royal Norfolk, East Anglian and Royal Anglian Regimental Associations}}</ref></blockquote>

Despite this plea however, it was announced at 15:00 that he was to be sentenced to death by hanging; Knöchlein paled but showed no emotion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norfolkbc.fsnet.co.uk/archive_collection/strips_farrow/mackillers_paradis.htm |title=Le Paradis Massacre |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Major John L.
