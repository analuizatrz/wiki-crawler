'''Tzaraath''' (''tzaraas'', ''tzaraat'', ''tsaraas'', ''tsaraat''; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] צרעת) is an affliction mentioned in the [[Tanakh]] and other [[Judaism|Jewish]] sources, starting in {{bibleverse||Leviticus|13|JP}}–{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14|JP}}. Although the term is commonly translated as ''[[leprosy]]'', the reported symptoms of tzaraath are not entirely consistent with leprosy. Furthermore, tzaraath was believed to affect the clothes and home of an afflicted person, not just his body.  See also: [[Metzora (parsha)]]

==Epidemiology==
Because the descriptions of ''tzaraath'' in Biblical texts are second-hand sources not intended to serve as epdemiological analyses, there is a fair amount of speculation involved in characterizing it.  Furthermore, although it is presumed to be a medical condition, these texts characterize it as a spiritual affliction with a supernatural cause.   Some aspects of these descriptions differ from that of [[leprosy]].  For instance, they say that tzaraath will sometimes go away on its own after the infected person has been secluded (Leviticus 14). Its ability to infect clothes and houses (Leviticus 13), is clearly not true of leprosy as it is known today.

According to Dr. Harold Spinka, M.D., and the Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia, Biblical leprosy describes a number of conditions.  Spinka states that besides including the modern leprosy, Biblical leprosy can also include various [[Dermatology|skin conditions]], [[syphilis]], [[smallpox]], and not merely the disease leprosy as understood today. Experts are divided on whether Biblical leprosy includes modern leprosy, see Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia citation in the references section.[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1959/JASA3-59Spinka.html] 
The Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia and the journal Perspectives in Biological Medicine state that Biblical leprosy may include [[mold]].[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14593226&dopt=Abstract]

Dr. Spinka wrote regarding the Levitical law regarding Biblical leprosy, "A review of Leviticus of the Old Testament shows that the priests were in charge of infectious diseases, as well as of the moral and religious welfare of the nation. The differential diagnosis between infectious and non-infectious cutaneous diseases is quite modern." [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1959/JASA3-59Spinka.html] Similarly, Arturo Castiglioni in ''A History of Medicine'' wrote, "The laws against leprosy in Leviticus 13 may be regarded as the first model of a sanitary legislation" (p. 71).  Castiglioni also stated, "Study of Biblical texts appears to have demonstrated that the ancient Semitic peoples, in agreement with the most modern tenets of epidemiology, attributed more importance to animal transmitters of disease, like the rat and the fly, than to the contagious individual" (p. 71).

==Causes of ''tzaraath''==
According to Jewish theological tradition, Tzaraath was often believed to have come not through [[Pathology|natural means]] but as a punishment for [[sin]], and to have been cured not through natural means but through [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]] and forgiveness. 

The [[Talmud]] (Babylonian Talmud Arachin 16a) lists seven causes for ''tzaraath'':
# ''[[lashon hara]]'' (speaking negatively of others)
# [[murder]]
# a vain [[oath]]
# illicit [[sexual intercourse]]
# [[pride]]
# [[theft]]
# stinginess

However, other ''[[midrash]]ic'' sources add other reasons, and one source states categorically that ''tzaraath'' appeared only as punishment for ''[[lashon hara]]''.

[[Midrash|Midrash Rabbah]] states that ''tzaraath'' initially affected a person's house. If he repented, it required only the removal of affected stones; if not, it required tearing down the entire house (as the ''tzaraath'' would not go away). Then the plagues came upon one's clothes. If he repented, they only required washing; if not, they required burning. Then the plagues would come upon a person's body. If he repented, he underwent purification; if not, "he shall dwell alone" (Leviticus 13:46).

==Types of ''tzaraath''==
===''Tzaraath'' of garments===
''Tzaraath'' could appear upon any article made of [[wool]], [[linen]], or [[leather]], not only garments; however, as most such items are garments, this form of ''tzaraas'' is commonly referred to as that of garments.

===''Tzaraath'' of houses===
If ''tzaraath'' were to appear upon the bricks of a house, everything in the house would be removed from the house, and a ''[[kohen]]'' would then examine the bricks. Depending on the severity of the ''tzaraath'', the bricks may need to be removed, or the house demolished.

''Tzaraath'' of houses is viewed by some as a [[punishment]], by others as a [[reward]] or [[blessing]], as follows.

It may be a punishment for stinginess. Suppose someone's neighbors ask him for the use of some item &mdash; a tool, perhaps &mdash; and he replies that he has no such item. ''Tzaraath'' may appear upon his house, so that all of his possessions are laid outside (see above), his neighbors will be able to look and see that he does indeed have whatever he would not lend them.

On the other hand, [[Rashi]] states at {{bibleverse||Leviticus|14|JPR}}, verse 34, (based on a Midrash: [[Leviticus Rabbah|Vayikra Rabbah]] 17:6) that ''tzaraath'' of houses was a blessing on the [[Israelites]] when they entered [[Canaan]] [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|in the thirteenth century BCE]]. The Canaanites had hid their gold and other valuables in the walls of their houses. When ''tzaraath'' appeared on a house and the bricks were removed, the homeowner would find the treasures that had been hidden.
