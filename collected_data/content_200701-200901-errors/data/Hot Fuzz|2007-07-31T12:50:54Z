'''''Hot Fuzz''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] police [[action film|action]]/[[comedy film|comedy]] film written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]] and starring Simon Pegg and [[Nick Frost]]. The three have worked together previously on the motion picture ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and the television series ''[[Spaced]]''. It was directed by [[Edgar Wright]] and produced by [[Nira Park]]. 

==Plot==
<!-- Move information that isn't so important to the Cast section to describe characters, ala the Star Wars/Lord of the Rings articles.-->
<!-- Please do not add spoiler warnings to the top and bottom of this section - as stated in Wikipedia policy regarding spoilers (which can be found in the [[Wikipedia:Spoiler]] article), spoiler warnings are unnecessary in sections in which it is already assumed that there will be spoilers,such as plot summaries. If you do add a spoiler warning, it will be deleted.-->

Nicholas Angel, an extremely dedicated and over-achieving [[police officer]] in [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service]], is so good that he makes everyone else on the service look bad. As a result his superiors send him to a place where his talents won’t be quite so embarrassing: the sleepy and seemingly crime-free [[village]] of [[Sandford (Hot Fuzz)|Sandford]], where there hasn't been a recorded murder for twenty years. 

Once there, he is partnered with well-meaning but overeager and naive police constable Danny Butterman, the son of local police Inspector Frank Butterman and the late Mrs Irene Butterman. A committed action movie fan, Danny is in awe of his new big-city partner, believing him to be a real-life "[[Bad Boys II|bad boy]]" who just might provide him with his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Angel, meanwhile, struggles to adjust to the quiet and uneventful pace of the village, and despite clearing up several otherwise unnoticed [[crime]]s and [[misdemeanor]]s in short order (such as shoplifters, underage drinkers and a farmer storing a huge supply of illegal weapons in his barn), soon finds his most pressing concern being a [[swan]] that has escaped from its owner. Faced with the reality of his situation, Angel and Danny eventually bond over drinks at the local pub and action movies.

Soon after Angel's arrival, a series of grisly deaths rock the village, all committed by an individual in a black hood and cloak. Increasingly convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and that the victims of the 'accidents' were murdered, Angel begins to clash with the other officers on the force, in particular the two detectives who believe that he's nothing more than an uptight city cop with an overactive imagination. However, Angel refuses to drop the [[investigation]] and initially suspects Simon "Sissy" Skinner, the charming but sinister manager of the local [[Somerfield (UK retailer)|Somerfield]] supermarket, of murdering the victims due to their involvement in a lucrative property deal. His confrontation with Skinner only reveals Skinner's apparent innocence and further damages Angel's credibility with his colleagues. 

After being ambushed in his hotel room by the cloaked murderer, who is unmasked as the giant trolley boy of the Somerfield supermarket acting under the instruction of Skinner, Angel is led to a nearby castle where he discovers the truth&mdash;Inspector Butterman, Skinner and the [[Neighbourhood Watch]] Alliance (NWA), intent on keeping Sandford's title of "Village of the Year", have been murdering anyone who may potentially damage the village's image. Angel discovers the bodies of various "problem" people whom the NWA have disposed of (several of whom Angel had encountered earlier in the movie), before being cornered and stabbed by Danny, apparently a member of the NWA.

Angel is not harmed, however; having tricked the NWA into believing that Angel is dead, Danny instead drives him to the village limits and releases him, insisting that he knew nothing about their true activities. Danny urges Angel to flee, reasoning that no one would believe the truth about Sandford. However, whilst at a rest stop Angel sees the two movies he and Danny bonded over on a nearby sales rack (''[[Point Break]]'' and ''[[Bad Boys II]]'') and is inspired to stop the NWA once and for all; to that end, he drives back to town and arms himself with the confiscated weapons seized earlier in the movie. After Angel meets with Danny in the village, the two begin to dispatch the members of the NWA in an increasingly destructive and frantic series of gun fights. 

Initially confronted by their colleagues in the Sandford Police Service (who are quickly persuaded of the truth), Angel and Danny take the battle to the supermarket. Skinner and Inspector Butterman flee, and are pursued by Angel and Danny to a nearby model village, where both are eventually subdued. Although Angel's old supervisors arrive from London begging Angel to return, as their crime statistics have risen drastically seemingly as a result of his absence, Angel elects to remain in Sandford. Back at the police station, the Sandford Police celebrate their triumph and attempt to complete their paperwork, but are ambushed by a remaining member of the NWA. He attempts to shoot Angel but Danny jumps in front of the blast. In the resulting chaos a confiscated [[naval mine]] is triggered and the station is destroyed. One year later, Angel lays flowers on a grave marked 'Butterman'; it is revealed that Danny has survived, however, and that the grave is his mother's. Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny to Sergeant, and the film ends as they go back to working the beat together in Sandford.

British singer and actor [[Joseph McManners]] also played a cameo role as a schoolboy at the climatic battle scene of the movie, however, his background story and an entire sub-plot surrounding his character was cut from the final version and can only be found on the DVD. [[Stephen Merchant]] also makes a brief appearance where at the end of the film when Angel is offered his job back in London just before he can be seen with the swan. <ref name="joemcmanners-hot-fuzz-character">[http://www.joemcmanners.com Official News Updates] at www.joemcmanners.com (accessed [[June 23]], [[2007]])</ref>

==Production==
Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script.<ref>{{cite web | author = Joe Utichi | title = Countryside Commandoes | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes | date = [[2007-02-13]] | url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/click/movie-1164807/reviews.php?rid=1598617 | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref> During the latter half of 2005, [[Working Title Films|Working Title]] approached several towns in [[South West England]] looking for an appropriate filming location. Simon Pegg commented "We're both from the [[West Country]] so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in [[Frome]]".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | episodelink =  | series = The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]] | airdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref> 

[[Stow-on-the-Wold]] was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon [[Wells]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/search/display.var.874709.0.thank_god_we_did_screen_film_event.php|title=Thank God we did screen film event|date=[[2006-08-11]]|publisher=Cotswold Journal}}</ref> Edgar Wright's hometown. Wright has commented "and Wells is very picturesque [...] I love it but I also want to trash it".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref> Filming also took place at the [[Hendon Police College]], including the driving school skid pan and athletic track.<ref>[http://www.movielocationsguide.com/Hot_Fuzz/filming_locations List of locations used in Wells, Somerset]</ref>

Wright has said that it takes elements from his final amateur film, ''Dead Right'', which he described as both "''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' set in Somerset" and "a ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' film in Somerset".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref>
He uses some of the same locations in both films including the Somerfield supermarket, where he used to work as a shelf-stacker.<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref>

The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said "Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into peoples heads [...] It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | episodelink =  | series = The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]] | airdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref> Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof in that, '"They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it."<ref>{{cite news | author = Clark Collis | title = Brits and Giggles | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2007-04-13]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20034733,00.html | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> The film was scored by [[David Arnold]] (well known for his [[James Bond (films)|James Bond series]] scores since 1997).

Filming commenced on [[March 19]], [[2006]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/newsArticle.php?newsID=115 | title=Filming under way on Hot Fuzz | publisher=Working Title Films | date=[[2006-03-20]]}}</ref> and lasted for 11 weeks.<ref name="channel4">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/apps26/film/reviews/film.jsp?section=indepth&id=159113&page=3|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref> Throughout the filming process Pegg, Frost and Wright recorded a regular [[video blog]] which is available on the ''Hot Fuzz'' section of the Working Title website.

Critically, the movie received positive reviews, and was rated almost as highly as their previous film, ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/shaun_of_the_dead/|title=Shaun of the Dead|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> It has a 90% fresh rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/hot_fuzz/|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2007-04-05}}</ref>. Olly Richards of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' said of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost "After almost a decade together they’re clearly so comfortable in each other’s presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours".<ref>{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Hot Fuzz | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10243 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> [[Johnny Vaughan]] of ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' already called it the "most arresting Brit-com of 2007".<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Johnny Vaughan]]|title=The Plod Couple|publisher=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|date=[[2007-02-16]]|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2007070721,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> Phillip French of ''[[The Observer]]'', who did not care for ''Shaun of the Dead'', warmed to the comedy team in this film.<ref>{{cite news|author=Phillip French|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[The Observer]]|date=[[2007-02-18]]|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,2015564,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> The film also received positive reviews stateside. Derek Elley of ''Variety'' praised Broadbent and Dalton, "[who] are especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect".<ref>{{cite news | author = Derek Elley | title = Hot Fuzz | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2007-02-20]]|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932857.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>  As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by [[screenwriter]] [[Shane Black]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Kolan|title=Interview With Edgar Wright (page 2)|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-03-13]]|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/772/772635p2.html|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

However, the ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' only gave ''Hot Fuzz'' 2/5, stating that "many of the jokes miss their target" as the film becomes more action-based.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/entertainment/movies/tm_headline=hot-fuzz%26method=full%26objectid=18621717%26siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Hot Fuzz|work=[[Daily Mirror]]}}</ref> ''[[Daily Mail]]'' also shared ''The Mirror'''s view, saying that "It's the lack of any serious intent that means too much of it is desperately unamusing, and unamusingly desperate".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/reviews.html?in_article_id=436569&in_page_id=1924|title=It aims.
