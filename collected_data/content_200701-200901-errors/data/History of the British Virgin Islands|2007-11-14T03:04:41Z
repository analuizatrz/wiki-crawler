The '''History of the British Virgin Islands''' is usually, for convenience, broken up into five separate periods:
* Pre-Columbian Amerindian settlement, up to an uncertain date
* Nascent European settlement, from approximately 1612 until 1672
* British control, from 1672 until 1834
* Emancipation, from 1834 until 1950
* The modern state, from 1950 to present day

These time periods are used for convenience only. There appears to be an uncertain period of time from when the last [[Arawak]]s left what would later be called the [[British Virgin Islands]] until the first Europeans started to settle there in the early 1600s, but each period commences with a dramatic change from the time period which precedes it, and so is a convenient way to compartmentalise the subject.

==Pre-Columbian settlement==

The first recorded settlement of the Territory was by Arawak Indians from [[South America]], in around 100 BC.  However, there is some dispute about the dates.  Some historians place it later, at around 200 AD, but they suggest that the Arawaks may have been preceded by the [[Ciboney]] Indians, who are thought to have settled in nearby [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] as early as 300 BC.<ref>Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 6</ref>  There is some evidence of [[Amerindian]] presence on the islands as far back as 1500 BC,[http://dg.ian.com/index.jsp?cid=54918&action=viewLocation&formId=105392] although there is little academic support for the idea of a permanent settlement on any of the current British Virgin Islands at that time.

The Arawaks inhabited the islands until the 1400s when they were displaced by the more aggressive [[Carib]]s, a tribe from the [[Lesser Antilles]] islands, after whom the [[Caribbean Sea]] is named. Some historians, however, believe that this popular account of warlike Caribs chasing peaceful Arawaks out of the Caribbean islands is rooted in simplistic European stereotypes, and that the true story is more complex.

None of the later European visitors to the Virgin Islands ever reported encountering Amerindians in what would later be the British Virgin Islands, although Columbus would have a hostile encounter with the Carib natives of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]].

Comparatively little is know about the early inhabitants of the Territory specifically (as opposed to the Arawaks generally).  The largest excavations of Arawak pottery have been found around Belmont and Smuggler's Cove on the northwest of [[Tortola]], but many other sites have been found, including at Soper's Hole, Apple Bay, Coxheath, Pockwood Pond, Pleasant Valley, Sage Mountain, Russell Hill (modern day [[Road Town]]), Pasea, Purcell, Paraquita Bay, Josiah's Bay, Mount Healthy and Cane Garden Bay.  Modern archaeological excavations regularly cause local historians to revise what they thought they knew about these early settlers.  Discoveries reported in the local newspapers in 2006 have caused postulation that the settlement of the islands by Arawaks may have been much more significant than had earlier been thought.

==1472 - Early European exploration==

The first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by [[Christopher Columbus]] in [[1493]] on his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus gave them the fanciful name ''Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Vírgenes'' (Saint Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins), shortened to ''Las Vírgenes'' (The Virgins), after the legend of [[Saint Ursula]]. He is also reported to have personally named [[Virgin Gorda]] (the Fat Virgin), which he thought to be the largest island in the group.

The Spanish claimed the islands by original discovery, but did nothing to enforce their claims, and never settled the Territory.  In [[1508]] [[Juan Ponce de León II|Juan Ponce de León]] settled [[Puerto Rico]], and reports in Spanish journals suggested that the settlement used the Virgin Islands for fishing, but nothing else.  It is unclear whether they sailed as far the modern British Virgin Islands to fish, and the references may be to the present [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].<ref>To sail from Puerto Rico to Tortola involves sailing against the prevailing wind for approximately 70 miles.  In the vessels of the day, which did not sail well upwind, this would have been a trip of 2 or 3 days.</ref>

In [[1517]] [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sir Sebastian Cabot]] and [[Thomas Pert|Sir Thomas Pert]] visited the islands on their way back from their exploration of Brazilian waters.

[[Image:NPG Drake.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Drake, who would visit the islands four times, and would lend his name to its main channel]]

[[John Hawkins|Sir John Hawkins]] visited the island three times, firstly in [[1542]] and then again in [[1563]] with a cargo of [[slave]]s bound for [[Hispaniola]].  On his third visit, he was accompanied by a young Captain by the name of [[Sir Francis Drake|Francis Drake]] in the ''Judith'', for whom the central channel in the British Virgin Islands would later be named.

Drake would return in [[1585]], and is reported to have anchored in North Sound on Virgin Gorda prior to his tactically brilliant attack on [[Santo Domingo]].  Drake returned for the final time in [[1595]] on his last voyage during which he would eventually meet his death.

In [[1598]] the [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|Earl of Cumberland]] is reported to have used the islands as a staging ground for his later attack on [[La Fortaleza]] in Puerto Rico.

In [[1607]] some reports suggest that [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]] sailed past the Virgin Islands on the expedition led by Captain [[Christopher Newport]] to found the new colony in [[Virginia]].

The English monarch, [[James I of England|King James I]], granted a patent to the [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Earl of Carlisle]] for [[Tortola]], as well as "[[Anguilla|Angilla]], Semrera ([[Sombrero, Anguilla|Sombrero island]]) & [[Anegada|Enegada]]".  He also received letters of patent for [[Barbados]], [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]] and "all the Caribees" in [[1628]].  Carlisle died shortly after, but his son, the 2nd Earl of Carlisle, leased the patents to [[Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey|Lord Willoughby]] for 21 years in [[1647]].  Neither ever attempted to settle the northern islands.

===First Dutch settlements===

It was a Dutch [[privateer]] named [[Joost van Dyk]] who organised the first permanent settlements in the Territory in Soper's Hole, on the West end of Tortola.  It is not know precisely when he first came to the Territory, but by 1615 van Dyk's settlement was recorded in Spanish contemporary records, noting its recent expansion.  He traded with the Spaniards in [[Puerto Rico]] and farmed cotton and tobacco.  

Some sources suggest that the first settlements in the Virgin Islands were by the Spanish, who mined copper at the [[Copper Mine, Virgin Gorda|copper mine on Virgin Gorda]], but there is no archaeological evidence to support the existence of any settlement by the Spanish in the islands at any time, or any mining of copper on Virgin Gorda prior to the 1800s.

By [[1625]] van Dyk was recognised by the [[Dutch West India Company]] as the private "Patron" of Tortola, and had moved his operations to [[Road Town]]. During the same year van Dyk lent some limited (non-military) support to the Dutch Admiral [[Boudewijn Hendricksz]], who sacked [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  In September 1625, in retaliation, the Spanish led a full assault on the island of Tortola, laying waste to its defences and destroying its embryonic settlements.  Joost van Dyk himself escaped to the island that would later [[Jost Van Dyke|bear his name]], and sheltered there from the Spanish.  He later moved to the island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] until the Spanish gave up and returned to Puerto Rico.

Notwithstanding the Spanish hostility, the Dutch West India Company still considered the Virgin Islands to have an important strategic value, as they were located approximately half way between the Dutch colonies in [[South America]] (now [[Suriname]]) and the most important Dutch settlement in [[North America]], [[New Amsterdam]] (now [[New York City]]).  Large stone warehouses were built at Freebottom, near Port Purcell (just east of Road Town), with the intention that these warehouses would facilitate exchanges of cargo between North and South America.

[[Image:Fort Charlotte, Tortola 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The remains of Fort Charlotte, built on an earlier lookout post erected by the Dutch]]

At this time, the Dutch settlers erected some small earthworks and a three-[[cannon]] [[fort]] above the warehouse, on the hill where [[Fort George, Tortola|Fort George]] would eventually be built by the English. He also constructed a wooden stockade to act as a lookout post above Road Town on the site that would eventually become [[Fort Charlotte, Tortola|Fort Charlotte]].  They also stationed troops at the Spanish "dojon" near Pockwood Pond, later to be known as [[Fort Purcell]], but now ordinarily referred to as "the Dungeon".

In [[1631]] the Dutch West India Company expressed an interest in the [[copper]] which had been [[Copper Mine, Virgin Gorda|discovered]] on [[Virgin Gorda]], and a settlement was set up on that island, which came to be known as "Little Dyk's" (now known as Little Dix).

In [[1640]] Spain attacked Tortola in an assault led by Captain Lopez.  Two further attacks were made by the Spanish on Tortola in [[1646]] and [[1647]] led by Captain Fancisco Vincente Duran.  The Spanish anchored a warship in Soper's Hole at West End and landed men ashore.  They then sent another warship to blockade Road Harbour.  After a team of scouts returned a safe report, the Spanish landed more men and attacked Fort Purcell overland by foot.  The Dutch were massacred, and the Spanish soldiers then moved marched to Road Town, where they killed everyone and destroyed the settlement.  They did not, apparently, attack the smaller settlements further up the coast in Baugher's Bay, or on Virgin Gorda.

===Decline of the Dutch West India Company===

The settlements were not ultimately an economic success, and the evidence suggests that the Dutch spent most of their time more profitably engaged in privateering (or piracy, depending upon one's perspective) than trading.  The lack of prosperity of the territory mirrored the lack of commercial success of the Dutch West India Company as a whole.

The company changed its policy, and it sought to cede islands such as Tortola and Virgin Gorda to private persons for settlement, and to establish [[slave]] pens.  The island of Tortola was eventually sold to [[Willem Hunthum]] at some point in the 1650s, at which time the Dutch West India Company's interest in the Territory effectively ended.

In [[1665]] the Dutch settlers on Tortola were attacked by a British privateer, John Wentworth, who is recorded as capturing 67 slaves which were removed to [[Bermuda]].  This is the first official record of slaves being held in the Territory.

Subsequently in [[1666]] there were reports that a number of the Dutch settlers were driven out by an influx of British "brigands and pirates", although clearly a number of the Dutch remained.<ref>Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 23</ref>

==1672 - British colonisation==

The British Virgin Islands came under British control in 1672, at the outbreak of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], and have remained so ever since.  The circumstances of the British taking control however are somewhat uncertain.  The Dutch averred that in 1672 Willem Hunthum put Tortola under the protection of Colonel Sir [[William Stapleton]], the English [[Governor-General]] of the [[Leeward Islands]].  Stapleton himself reported that he had captured the Territory shortly after the outbreak of war.

What is clear is that Colonel William Burt was dispatched to Tortola and took control of the island by no later than [[13 July]] [[1672]] (when Stapleton reported the conquest to the Council of Trade).  Burt did not have sufficient men to occupy the Territory, but before leaving the island, he destroyed the Dutch forts and removed all their cannon to [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]].<ref>Which perhaps suggested conquest rather than safekeeping.</ref>  

By the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] of [[1674]], the war was ended, and provision was made for mutual restoration of all territorial conquests during the war.  The Treaty provided the Dutch with the right to resume possession of the islands, but by then the Dutch were at war with the French, and fear of a French attack prevented their immediate restoration.  Although the possessions were not considered valuable, for strategic reasons the British became reluctant to surrender them, and after prolonged discussions, orders were issued to Stapleton in June 1677 to retain possession of Tortola and the surrounding islands.  

In [[1678]] the [[Franco-Dutch War]] ended, and the Dutch returned their attention to Tortola, although it was not until [[1684]] that the Dutch ambassador, Arnout van Citters, formally requested the return of Tortola.  However, he did not do so on the basis of the Treaty of Westminster, but instead based the claim on the private rights of the widow of Willem Hunthum.  He asserted that the island was not a conquest, but had been entrusted to the British.  The ambassador provided a letter from Stapleton promising to return the island.<ref>Part of the dis-communication that arose between the British and Dutch related to the fundamental conceptual differences between the treatment of colonies; the British viewed colonies as belonging to the Crown, and settled with its permission; the Dutch viewed colonies as belonging to the individuals, with the benefit of the Crown's protection.</ref>

At this time ([[1686]]), Stapleton had completed his term of office and was ''en route'' back to Britain.  The Dutch were told Stapleton would be asked to explain the discrepancy between his assertion of having conquered the island, and the correspondence signed by him indicating a promise to return it, after which a decision would be made.  Unfortunately Stapleton travelled first to France to recover his health, where unfortunately he died.  Cognisant that other Caribbean territories which had been captured from the Dutch during the war had already been restored, in August 1686 the Dutch ambassador was advised by the British that Tortola would be restored, and instructions to that effect were sent to Sir [[Nathaniel Johnson]], the new Governor of the Leeward Islands.  

But Tortola was never actually returned to the Dutch.<ref>The correspondence all refers solely to Tortola, which appears to be the limits of the Territory that the Dutch claimed.  However, the British subsequently asserted control over the entire island group.</ref>  Part of the problem was that Johnson's orders were to restore the island to such person or persons who have "sufficient procuration or authority to receive the same..."  However, most of the former Dutch colonists had now departed, having lost hope of restoration.  Certainly there was no official representation of the Dutch monarchy or any other organ of government.  In the event, Johnson did nothing.

In November [[1696]] a subsequent claim was made to the island by Sir Peter van Bell, the agent of Sir Joseph Shepheard, a [[Rotterdam]] merchant, who claimed to have purchased Tortola on 21 June 1695 for 3,500 [[Dutch gulden|guilder]]s.  Shepheard was from the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], and the prospect of Tortola coming under Brandenburger control did not sit well in [[Westminster]].<ref>This was largely a reaction to Brandenburger activities in relation to trade between Britain and Holland in Europe at the time.</ref>  The Brandenburg claim was dismissed by the British on the grounds that Stapleton had conquered rather than been entrusted with Tortola.  The now common delaying tactic of forwarding all correspondence to Governor Codrington for comment was employed.  Codrington readily appreciated the risks of a Brandenburg trading outpost on Tortola, as such an outpost already existed on nearby St. Thomas.<ref>Codrington even suggested that van Bell's actual claim appeared to relate to the St. Thomas outpost and not Tortola at all; whether a ruse or a ''bona fide'' interpretation, merely making such a comment would involve 6 months in returns of correspondence by sailing vessel across the Atlantic.</ref>  The Brandenburgers had previously set up an outpost for trading slaves on Peter Island in [[1690]], which they had abandoned, and they were not considered welcome.  At the time they had an outpost on St. Thomas, but they engaged in no agriculture, and only participated in the trading of slaves.  Negotiations became more intense, and the British re-asserted the right of conquest and also (wrongly, but apparently honestly) claimed to have first discovered Tortola.  During the negotiations, the British also became aware of two older historical claims, the 1628 patent granted to the Earl of Carlisle (which was inconsistent with Hunthum's title being sold to him by the Dutch West India company), and an order of the King in 1694 to prevent foreign settlement in the Virgin Islands.  In February [[1698]] Codrington was told to regard the earlier 1694 orders as final, and the British entertained no further claims to the islands.

===Geographical limits of the Territory===
[[Image:DSC00835.JPG|thumb|right|300px|St. John, claimed by the British but never settled.  They effectively abandoned their claim to the island in 1718.]]
Although the islands which presently form the British Virgin Islands have been under British control since 1672, a number of other islands came under the control of the British Crown (some more than once) during the subsequent period, but no longer form part of the Territory.  At the time the British took control of the territory, the following islands were considered part of the Virgin Islands.<ref>The prefix "British" to describe the British Virgin Islands only began to be used in the 1940s as a response to the U.S.A. renaming the Danish Antilles the "U.S. Virgin Islands".  Legally, the name of the Territory is still the "Virgin Islands" ''simpliciter''.</ref>

* '''[[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]]'''.  The British initially claimed St. Thomas (and St. John as well), but in [[1717]] the Danish disputed their claim to those islands.  In contrast to the long dispute over ownership of Tortola, the dispute over St. Thomas was settled readily with a year.  The Danish claim was strong; they had the benefit of the Treaty of Alliance and Commerce of [[1670]] between Britain and Denmark, which led to the founding of the [[Danish West India Company]] in [[1671]] which its charter permitted it to take possession of and occupy the two islands.  On 25 May [[1672]] the Danes took possession of St. Thomas, and discovered it to have been abandoned by the British settlers some weeks earlier.  The British could scarcely object to the Danes retaining the island.
* '''[[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]]'''.  However, no sooner than the dispute over St. Thomas settled, than acrimony flared up again over St. John, when the Danes purported to settle it on 23 March [[1718]].  The reaction of [[Walter Hamilton]], Governor of the Leeward Islands, was immediate.  He dispatched the [[HMS Scarborough|HMS ''Scarborough'']] to the island.  A period of fraught negotiations followed, but ultimately the Danes refused to quit St. John, and the British declined to use force to seize it.  Truthfully, the British were less concerned about St. John than about St. Croix, which they thought that the Danes would eventually covet as well.
* '''[[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]]''' (or ''St. Cruz'', as it was known at the time).  The British fears proved to be well founded.  In [[1729]] a claim was made to St. Croix by the Danes who (in an ironic twist) claimed it had been sold to them by the French.  St. Croix had been settled at an uncertain point over a century before by settlers from a number of different European nations, but in [[1645]] violence had flared up between them, and the English governor was [[murder]]ed.  The English summarily expelled the Dutch, and the French, at their own request, were removed to [[Guadeloupe]], leaving the British in sole control of the island.  But in [[1650]] the Spanish invaded from Puerto Rico and the British surrendered the island.  Later in the same year the Dutch had sought to return to St. Croix, believing that the Spanish would by then have returned  to Puerto Rico, but when they arrived the Spanish were still there, and the Dutch were all killed or captured.  The Governor General of the French Caribbean colonies then subsequently mounted an attack on the island at his own expense and drove out the Spanish, but he was unable to establish a colony, and surrendered the title to the island to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Order of Malta]] in [[1653]].<ref>The transfer was confirmed by the French monarchy by letters patent.</ref>  In [[1665]] St. Croix reverted by purchase to the [[French West India Company]], and upon the Company's collapse in [[1674]], the King of France claimed it as part of his dominions, although the island was subsequently ordered to be abandoned as an economic failure - the date of abandoning would later be hotly disputed.  In May [[1733]] the French purported to sell the island to the Danish West India Company.  If the French had only abandoned it in [[1695]] (as they asserted), it was French at the time of the Treaty.  If the French had abandoned the island in [[1671]] (as the British claimed), then under the 1686 Treaty, St. Croix would be peacably in British possession.   In the end, the French had documents to support their claim, and the British did not, and so the Council of Trade admitted that "upon the whole we must submit... whether it may be proper to advise His Majesty to insist any longer upon a title so weakly supported."  The British thereafter ceased to resist the French sale of the island to the Danes.

Britain would actually conquer St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix in March 1801 through the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]], but they restored them by the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in March, 1802.  They were then re-taken in December 1807, but were restored again by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1815.  Thereafter they would remain under Danish control until 1917 when they were sold to the U.S.A. for US$25 million, and were later renamed the "U.S. Virgin Islands".

*'''[[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]]''' (or ''Crab Island'', as the British referred to it).  Vieques was periodically settled by the British, but on each occasion they were driven off by Spanish soldiers from nearby Puerto Rico.  In the early 1700s the Colonial authorities ordered the removal of British settlers on Vieques and re-settled them on [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]].  Ironically enough, a century later after emancipation a number of former slaves would go and seek work on Vieques as free men of colour, notwithstanding that Vieques was still a slave owning society.

Relationships with the Danes were strained from the outset.  The Danes continuously resorted to nearby islands for timber, clearly violating British sovereignty.  British ships which foundered in St. Thomas was subject to extortionate levy for [[Marine salvage#Ship salvage and the law|salvage]].  Further, St. Thomas became a base for pirates and privateers which the Danish Governor either could not or would not stop.  During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] the Danes supported the French colonies, and allowed the French to sell British ships seized as [[prize (law)|prizes]] in [[Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands|Charlotte Amalie]].  No doubt the British invasions in the early 1800s did not help relations, and in later years smuggling and illegal sales of slaves by St. Thomians would frustrate British authorities.

===Law and order===

{{see also|Piracy in the British Virgin Islands}}

Even after British control of the Territory became complete, population infiltration was slow.  Settlers lived in fear of possible Spanish attack, and there was the constant possibility that diplomatic efforts might fail and the Territory might revert to an overseas power (as happened in St. Croix).  Spanish raids in [[1685]] and ongoing negotiations between the Dutch and the British over the fate of the islands led to them being virtually abandoned; from 1685 to 1690 the population of the Territory was reduced to two - a Mr Jonathan Turner and his wife.  In [[1690]] there was a relative explosion in the population, which had swollen to fourteen.  By [[1696]] it was up to fifty.

[[Image:Old HM Prison, Road Town.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The old HM Prison in Road Town.  Used up until 1996, it was built on the site of an earlier prison in the mid 1800s]]

From [[1678]] the British appointed a deputy-governor for the Territory (initially for the Territory and Saba and St. Eustatius, until the latter two islands were returned to the Dutch).  The role was somewhat vague, and had no legislative, executory or judicial powers attached to it.  The deputy-governor was encouraged to appoint a local governor beneath him, though it was common complaint being unable "to gett one that's tolerable fitt amongst them to take the command upon them."<ref>Calendar of State Papers, America and the West Indies, 1716-1717, No. 350</ref>  In 1709 Governor Parke observed that "they live like wild people without law or Government, and have neither Divine nor Lawyer amongst them..."  

It was not until [[1773]] that the Virgin Islands actually had its own legislature.<ref>Prior to that laws were extended to the Territory by the legislature in Antigua.  Some of these laws are still in force in the British Virgin Islands, such as the Common Law (Declaration of Application) Act, 1705</ref>  The uncertainty of tenure and slightly ambivalent official British attitude to the fate of the Territory influenced the early population - for many years only debtors from other islands, pirates and those fleeing the law were prepared to undertake the risk of settling in the Virgin Islands.  Most references to the islands from occasional visitors comment on the lack of law and order and the lack of religiosity of the inhabitants.

The Territory was granted a Legislative Assembly on [[27 January]] [[1774]], however, it took a full further decade for a constitutional framework to be settled.  Part of the problem was that the islands were so thinly populated, it was almost impossible to constitute the organs of government.  In [[1778]] [[George Suckling]] arrived in the Territory to take up his position as Chief Justice of the Territory.  In the event, a court was not actually established until the Court Bill was passed in [[1783]], but even then the vested interests ensured that Suckling could still not take up his position, and the islands had a court but no judge.  Suckling finally left the islands without ever taking up his post (or ever being paid) on 2 May [[1788]], impoverished and embittered, due to the machinations of local interests which were fearful of the recourse of their creditors if a court was to be established.  Suckling was forthright in expressing his views on the state of law and order in the Territory - he described the residents of Tortola as "in a state of lawless ferment.  Life, liberty and property were hourly exposed to the insults and depredations of the riotous and lawless.  The authority of His Majesty's Council, as conservators of the peace, was defied and ridiculed...  The island presented a shocking state of anarchy; miserable indeed, and disgraceful to government, not to be equalled in any other of His Majesty's dominions, or perhaps in any civilized country in the world."

Almost 100 years after Governor Parke had expressed his views, one of his successors would speak in similar terms.  On his appointment in [[1810]], Governor [[George Elliot]] was struck by the "state of irritation ... almost of anarchy".  Writer Howard, an agent selling a distressed cargo of slaves from a shipwreck in Tortola in [[1803]] wrote that "Tortola is well nigh the most miserable, worst-inhabited spot in all the British possessions... this unhealthy part of the globe appears overstocked with each description of people except honest ones."

===Quaker settlement===

Although short in both duration and number, the Quaker settlement in the British Virgin Islands from 1727 to 1768 would play an important part in the history of the Territory for two reasons.  Firstly, the trenchant opposition of the Quakers to slavery had a contributing effect to the improvements in the treatment of slaves within the Territory (the exceptional case of [[Arthur William Hodge]] notwithstanding) compared to other Caribbean islands, and to the large number of [[free people of color|free blacks]] within the islands.  Secondly, for such a small community, a large number of famous historical figures came from that small community, including [[John C. Lettsome]], [[William Thornton]], [[Samuel Nottingham]] and [[Richard Humphreys]].  There are some vague assertions that Arthur Penn, brother of the more famous [[William Penn]], also formed part of the Quaker community of the British Virgin Islands for a time.<ref>Florence Lewisohn, ''Tales of Tortola and the British Virgin Islands'', pages 40 and 41, although she cites no authority beyond local legend for the proposition,</ref>  However, this seems unlikely as the dates of his lifetime do not fit easily within the timeframe of the Quaker community in the British Virgin Islands, and as Quaker history is generally very well documented, it is unlikely that an expedition by a member of such a famous family would go unnoticed.

===Fortification===
[[Image:Fort Recovery 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fort Recovery, a traditional tower fort.]]
Between 1760 and 1800 the British significantly upgraded the defences of the Territory.  Usually building upon earlier Dutch fortifications, new structures armed with [[cannon]] were erected at [[Fort Charlotte, Tortola|Fort Charlotte]], [[Fort George, Tortola|Fort George]], [[Fort Burt]], [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]] and a new fort was built in the centre of Road Town which came to be known as the [[Road Town Fort]].  As was common at the time, plantation owners were expected to fortify their own holdings, and [[Fort Purcell]] and [[Fort Hodge]] were erected on this basis.

==Slavery economy==
{{main|Slavery in the British Virgin Islands}}

In common with most [[Caribbean]] countries, slavery in the British Virgin Islands forms a major part of the history of the Territory.  One commentator has gone so far as to say: "One of the most important aspects of the History of the British Virgin Islands is slavery."<ref>Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 45</ref>

As [[Tortola]], and to a lesser extent [[Virgin Gorda]], came to be settled by [[plantation]] owners, slave labour became economically essential, and there was an exponential growth in the slave population during the 1700s.  In [[1717]] there were 547 black people in the Territory (all of whom were assumed to be slaves); by [[1724]], there were 1,430; and [[1756]], there were 6,121.  The increase in slaves held in the Territory is, to a large degree, consistent with development of the economy of the British Virgin Islands at the time.

===Slave revolts===

Uprisings in the Territory were common, as they were elsewhere in the Caribbean.  The first notable uprising in the British Virgin islands occurred in [[1790]], and centred on the estates of Isaac Pickering.  It was quickly put down, and the [[ringleader]]s were [[capital punishment|executed]].  The revolt was sparked by the rumour that freedom had been granted to slaves in England, but that the planters were withholding knowledge of it.  The same rumour would also later spark subsequent revolts.

Subsequent rebellions also occurred in [[1823]], [[1827]] and [[1830]], although in each case they were quickly put down.

Probably the most significant slave insurrection occurred in [[1831]] when a plot was uncovered to kill all of the white males in the Territory and to escape to [[Haiti]] (which was at the time the only free black republic in the world) by boat with all of the white females.  Although the plot does not appear to have been especially well formulated, it caused widespread panic, and military assistance was drafted in from St. Thomas.  A number of the plotters (or accused plotters) were executed.

It is perhaps unsurprising that the incidence of slave revolts increased sharply after 1822.  In 1807, the trade in slaves was abolished.  Although the existing slaves were forced to continue their servitude, the [[Royal Navy]] patrolled the Atlantic, capturing slave ships and freeing slave cargoes.  Starting in 1808 hundreds of freed Africans were deposited on Tortola by the Navy who, after serving a 14 year "apprenticeship", were then absolutely free.  Naturally, seeing free Africans in the Territory created enormous resentment and jealousy amongst the existing slave population, who understandably felt this to be enormously unjust.

==1834 - Emancipation==
[[Image:BrotherSlave.jpg|thumb|left|Emancipation pamphlet, circa 1815]]
The abolition of slavery occurred on [[1 August]] [[1834]], and to this day it is celebrated by a [[Public holidays in the British Virgin Islands|three day public holiday]] on the first Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August in the British Virgin Islands.  The original emancipation proclamation hangs in the High Court.  However, the abolition of slavery was not the single defining event that it is sometimes supposed to have been.  Emancipation freed a total of 5,792 slaves in the Territory, but at the time of abolition, there were already a considerable number of free blacks in the Territory, possibly as many as 2,000.<ref>A number of settlers in the Territory, [[John C. Lettsome]] and [[Samuel Nottingham]] amongst them, had manumitted large numbers of slaves.  Lettsome manumitted 1,000 slaves upon inheriting them.  Further, subsequent to the abolition of the slave trade, the [[Royal Navy]] deposited a number of freed Africans in the Territory who settled in the Kingston area on [[Tortola]].  In January of 1808, the [[HMS Cerberus|HMS ''Cerberus'']] seized the American schooner, the ''Nancy'' with a cargo of enslaved Senegalese Africans in the Territory's waters; between August 1814 and February of 1815 a further four ships' slave cargoes were seized from the ''Venus'', the ''Manuella'', the ''Atrevido'' and the ''Candelaria'' and a further 1,318 liberated slaves were deposited on Tortola's shores (of whom just over 1,000 survived).  In 1819, a Portuguese slave ship, the ''Donna Paula'', was wrecked upon the reef at Anegada. The ship's crew and 235 slaves were saved from the wreckage.  Further Spanish ships, ''en route'' to [[Puerto Rico]] were reported wrecked off Anegada in 1817 and 1824, and their cargos settled on Tortola.  Although many of these former slaves died due to the appalling conditions that they were kept in during the transatlantic crossing, a large number survived, and had children.</ref>  Furthermore, the effect of abolition was gradual; the freed slaves were not absolutely manumitted,<ref>Except for those under the age of 6, who were immediately freed.</ref> but instead entered a form of forced apprenticeship which lasted four years for house slaves and six years for field slaves.<ref>[[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], section 4[http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm]</ref>  The terms of the forced apprenticeship required them to provide 45 hours unpaid labour a week to their former masters, and prohibited them from leaving their residence without the masters permission.  The effect, deliberately, was to phase out reliance on slave labour rather than end it with a bang.  The Council would later legislate to reduce this period to four years for all slaves to quell rising dissent amongst the field slaves.

[[Joseph John Gurney]], a [[Quaker]], wrote in his ''Familiar Letters to Henry Clay of Kentucky'' that the plantation owners in Tortola were "decidedly saving money by the substitution of free labor on moderate wages, for the deadweight of slavery".<ref>However, as a Quaker, Gurney was fundamentally opposed to slavery, and so his comments should perhaps be read accordingly.</ref>

In practice, the economics of the abolition are difficult to quantify.  Undeniably the original slave owners suffered a huge capital loss.  Although they received £72,940 from the British Government in compensation, this was only a fraction of the true economic value of the manumitted slaves.<ref>It is difficult to quantify precisely the value of the freed slaves, but in [[1798]] the total value of slaves in the British Virgin Islands had been estimated at £360,000.  It is likely that figure would have increased considerably during the subsequent 36 years, particularly as the price of slaves rose enormously after the passing of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]].</ref>  In terms of net cash flow, whilst the slave owners lost the right to "free" slave labour, they now no longer had to pay to house, clothe and provide medical attention for their former slaves, which in some cases almost balanced out.  The former slaves now usually worked for the same masters, but instead received small wages, out of which they had to pay for the expenses formerly borne by their masters.  However, some former slaves managed to amass savings, which clearly demonstrates that in net terms the slave owners were less well off in income terms as well as capital as a result of abolition.

===Decline of the sugar industry===

An often held view is that the economy of the British Virgin Islands deteriorated considerably after the abolition of slavery.  Whilst this is, strictly speaking, true, it also disguises the fact that the decline had several different causes.  In 1834 the Territory was an agricultural economy with two main crops: [[sugar]] and [[cotton]].  Of the two, sugar was the considerably more lucrative export.

Shortly after the abolition of slavery the Territory was rocked by a series of [[hurricane]]s.  At the time, there was no accurate method of forecasting hurricanes, and their effect was devastating.  A particularly devastating hurricane struck in 1837, which was reported to have completed destroyed 17 of the Territory's sugar works.  Further hurricanes hit in 1842 and 1852.  Two more struck in 1867<ref>The hurricane of 1867 was responsible for the sinking of the [[RMS Rhone|RMS ''Rhone'']]</ref> and 1871.  The island also suffered severe drought between 1837<ref>Presumably apart from the hurricane</ref> and 1847, which made sugar plantation almost impossible to sustain.

[[Image:Brewers Bay Sugar Mill (2).jpg|thumb|right|250px|An abandoned and ruined sugar mill in Brewer's Bay.]]

To compound these miseries, in [[1846]] the United Kingdom passed the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846]] to equalise duties on sugar grown in the colonies.  Removing market distortions had the net effect of making prices fall, a further blow to plantations in the British Virgin Islands.

In [[1846]] the commercial and trading firm of Reid, Irving & Co. collapsed.  The firm had 10 sugar estates in the British Virgin Islands and employed 1,150 people.  But the actual economic effect of its failure was much wider; the company also acted as a ''de facto'' bank in the Territory, allowing advances to be drawn on the company as credit.  Further, the company had represented the only remaining direct line of communication to the United Kingdom; after its collapse mail had to be sent via St. Thomas and [[Copenhagen]].

By [[1848]], [[Edward Hay Drummond Hay]], the [[List of Presidents of the British Virgin Islands|President of the British Virgin Islands]], reported that: "there are now no properties in the Virgin Islands whose holders are not embarrassed for want of capital or credit sufficient to enable them to carry on the simplest method of cultivation effectively."

In December [[1853]] there was a disastrous outbreak of [[cholera]] in the Territory, which killed nearly 15% of the population.<ref>A total of 942 deaths were recorded out of a total population of 6,919 (13.9%)</ref>  This was followed by an outbreak of [[smallpox]] in Tortola and [[Jost Van Dyke]] in [[1861]] which caused a further 33 deaths.

Up until 1845 the value of sugar exported from the Territory varied, but averaged around £10,000 per annum over the preceding ten years.  With the exception of 1847 (an unusually good year), the average for the subsequent 10 years was under £3,000.  By 1852 it had fallen below £1,000 and would never recover.

Although this was terrible news for the islands as a whole, as Isaac Dookhan has pointed out,<ref>Isaac Dookhan, ''History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 127</ref> this did mean that the value of land plummeted sharply, and enabled the newly free black community to purchase land where otherwise it might not have been able to do so.  It also created the basis for the future peasant agricultural economy of the British Virgin Islands.

===Insurrection===
Soon after emancipation the newly freed black population of the British Virgin Islands started to become increasingly disenchanted that freedom had not brought the prosperity that they had hoped for.  Economic decline had led to increased tax burdens, which became a source of general discontent, for former slaves and other residents of the Territory alike.  

In [[1848]] a major disturbance occurred in the Territory.  The causes of the disturbance were several.  A revolt of slaves was occurring in St. Croix, which increased the general fervour in the islands, but the free population of Tortola were much more concerned with two other grievances: the appointment of public officials, and the crackdown on smuggling.  Although Tortola had sixteen coloured public officials, all except one were "foreigners" from outside the Territory.  During the period of economic decline, smuggling had been one of the few lucrative sources of employment, and recent laws which imposed stringent financial penalties (with hard labour for non-payment) were unpopular.  The anger was directed against the magistrates by the small shop keepers, and they concentrated their attack on the stipendiary magistrate, Isidore Dyett.  However, Dyett was popular with the rural population, who respected him for protecting them from unscrupulous planters.<ref>Isaac Dookham, ''History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 154 and 155</ref>  The ringleaders of the insurrection had supposed that their attack would lead to a general revolt, but their choice of Dyett as a target robbed them of popular support, and the disturbance eventually fizzled.

However, the insurrection of [[1853]] was a far more serious affair, and would have much graver and more lasting consequences.  Arguably it was the single most defining event in the islands' history.  Taxation and economics was also at the root of that disturbance.  In March of 1853 Robert Hawkins and Joshua Jordan, both Methodist missionaries, petitioned the Assembly to be relieved on taxes.  The Assembly rejected the request, and Jordan is said to have replied "we will raise the people against you."<ref>Source: Colonial Office papers 239/95 enclosure in a letter from Chads to Newcastle, 29 August 1853</ref>  Subsequent meetings fostered the general discontent.  Then in June 1853 the legislature enacted a head tax on cattle in the Territory.  Injudiciously, the tax was to come into effect on 1 August, the anniversary of emancipation.  The burden of the tax would fall most heavily on the rural coloured community.  There was no violent protest when the Act was passed, and it has been suggested that rioting could have been avoided if the legislature had been more circumspect in enforcing it,<ref>Isaac Dookham, ''History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 156</ref> although the historical background suggests that insurrection was never far away, and only needed a reason to spark into life.  

On 1 August 1853 a large body of rural labourers came to [[Road Town]] to protest the tax.  However, instead of showing a conciliatory approach, the authorities immediately read the [[Riot Act]], and made two arrests.  Violence then erupted almost immediately.  Several constables and magistrates were badly beaten, the greater part of Road Town itself was burned down, and a large number of the plantation houses were destroyed, cane fields were burned and sugar mills destroyed.  Almost all of the white population fled to [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]].  President [[John Cornell Chads|John Chads]] showed considerable personal courage, but little judgement or tact.<ref>Isaac Dookham, ''History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 156</ref>  On 2 August he met a gathering of 1,500 to 2,000 protesters, but all he would promise to do was relay their grievances before the legislature (which could not meet, as all the other members had fled).  One protester was shot (the only recorded death during the disturbances themselves) which led to the continuation of the rampage.  By 3 August, the only white people remaining in the Territory were John Chads himself, the Collector of Customs, a Methodist missionary and the island's doctor.

The riots were eventually suppressed with military assistance from St. Thomas, and reinforcements of British troops dispatched by the Governor of the Leeward Islands from [[Antigua]].  Twenty of the ringleaders of the riots were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment; three were [[capital punishment|executed]].

==="Decline and disorder"===

The period which followed the riots of 1853 has been referred to by one historian as the period of "decline and disorder".<ref>Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 61</ref>  Some commentators have suggested that the white population essentially refused to return, and the islands "went to de bush".<ref>Florence Lewisohn, ''Tales of Tortola and the British Virgin Islands'', page 62</ref>  But this is clearly an exaggeration.  Whilst many whites did not return to their heavily mortgaged and now ruined estates, some did, and rebuilt.  But the rebuilding required as a result of the insurrection, as well as the climate of uncertainty it created, alongside the existing poor economic conditions, created an economic depression which would take nearly a century to lift.  It would in fact take a full two years before even the schools in the Territory would be able to open again.<ref>The first schools formally reopened in May 1855.  Reports indicated that others reopened "gradually" but do not indicate when the last school reopened.</ref>

Tensions in the Territory continued to simmer, and local unrest ran high.  Exports continued to decline, and large numbers travelled abroad seeking work.  In 1887 a plot for an armed rebellion was uncovered.  In 1890 a dispute over smuggling led to further violence, and a Long Look resident, Christopher Flemming, emerged as a local hero simply for standing up to authority.  In each case widespread damage was averted by bringing in reinforcements for the local authorities from Antigua and, in 1890, from St. Thomas.   

Whilst the violence undoubtedly reflected disenchantment with the economic decline and lack of social services, it would be wrong to construe this period as a form of "Dark Ages" for the Territory.  During this period there was, for the first time, a significant expansion in the islands' schools.  By [[1875]] the Territory had 10 schools; a remarkable development in light of the complete absence of functional schools after the insurrection of 1853.  This period also saw the first coloured British Virgin Islander, [[Fredrick Augustus Pickering]], appointed as President in [[1884]].  

Pickering stepped down in 1887, and in 1889 the title of the office was changed to Commissioner, marking a clear decrease in administrative responsibilities.  Offices were also consolidated to save on salaries.<ref>The President also served as Magistrate and Treasurer.</ref> The Council itself became less and less functional, and it only narrowly avoided dissolution by appointing two popular local figures, Joseph Romney and Pickering.

==Modern developments==
[[Image:C de Castro and I Fonseca - busts.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The busts of Isaac Fonseca and Carlton de Castro outside of the Legislative Council.]]
However, in 1901 the Legislative Council ''was'' finally formally dissolved, and the islands were then officially administered through the Governor of the Leeward Islands, who appointed a commissioner and an executive council.  The Territory was not remotely economically prosperous, and social services had deteriorated to vanishing point.  Emigration was extremely high, particularly to St. Thomas and to the [[Dominican Republic]].  Both concern and assistance from Britain was in very short supply, not least because of the two [[World War]]s which were fought during this period.

In 1947 another unlikely hero emerged.  H. Faulkner was a fisherman from Anegada, who came to Tortola with his pregnant wife.  He had a disagreement with the medical officer, and he went straight to the marketplace and for several nights criticised the government with mounting passion.  His oratory struck a chord, and a movement started.  Led by community leaders such as Isaac Fonseca and Carlton de Castro, a throng of over 1,500 British Virgin Islanders marched on the Commissioner's office and presented their grievances.  The voices of the people were heard. 

===1950 - Self government===
[[Image:Old LegCo Building, Road Town.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Legislative Council building in Road Town, erected about sixty yeards from the market where Faulker roused the crowds.]]
As a result of the demonstrations the previous year, the Legislative Council was reinstituted in 1950 under a new [[constitution]].  The reformation of the Legislative Council is often left as a footnote in the Territory's history - a mere part of the process that led to the more fundamental constitutional government in 1966 - and the 1950 constitution was in fact always envisaged as a temporary measure.  But, having been denied any form of democratic control for nearly 50 years, the new Council did not sit idly by.  In 1951 external capital was brought in to assist farmers from the Colonial Welfare and Development office.  In 1953 the Hotel Aid Act was enacted to boost the nascent [[tourism]] industry.<ref>Pursuant to which [[Fort Burt]] hotel, Treasure Isle hotel and Little Dix Bay (built by [[Laurance Rockefeller]]) were built almost immediately.</ref>  Up until 1958 the Territory had only 12 miles of motorable roads; over the next 12 years the road system was vastly improved, linking West End to the East End of Tortola, and joining Tortola to [[Beef Island]] by bridge.  The [[Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport|Beef Island airport]] (now renamed after [[Terrance B. Lettsome]]) was built shortly thereafter.  The Territory considered holding a [[plebiscite]] as to whether the British and [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] should merge under the U.S. flag, but (although there was no opposition from Westminster) it is unlikely that the U.S. State Department would have acquiesced to taking over responsibility for the impoverished Territory, and in the event no plebiscite was ever held.

External events also played a factor.  In 1956 the [[Leeward Islands Federation]] was abolished.  Defederation enhanced the political status of the British Virgin Islands.  Jealous of its newly acquired powers, the Council declined to join the new [[Federation of the West Indies]] in 1958, a move that would later be crucial in the development of the [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore finance]] industry.

In 1966 the new constitution with a much greater transfer of powers was brought into effect by order in council.  Elections followed in 1967, and a comparatively young [[Lavity Stoutt]] was elected as the first [[Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands|Chief Minister]] of the Territory.

===Financial services===
[[Image:Harney Westwood & Riegels.jpg|thumb|right|The financial services industry led to surge in growth in the Territory.]]
The fortunes of the Territory dramatically improved in the late twentieth century with the advent of the [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore financial services]] industry.  Former president of the BVI's [[British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission|Financial Services Commission]], [[Michael Riegels]], recites the anecdote that the industry commenced on an unknown date in the 1970s when a lawyer from a firm in New York telephoned him with a proposal to incorporate a [[company (law)|company]] in the British Virgin Islands to take advantage of a [[double taxation]] [[tax treaty|relief treaty]] with the United States.  Within the space of a few years, hundreds of such companies had been incorporated.  

This eventually came to the attention of the United States government, who unilaterally revoked the Treaty in 1981.<ref>The British Virgin Islands was not alone in this regard; this was part of a policy of mass-repeal by the United States of double tax relief treaties with "[[microstate]]s".</ref>  

In 1984 the British Virgin Islands, trying to recapture some of the lost offshore business, enacted a new form of companies legislation, the [[International Business Companies Act]], under which an [[offshore company]] which was exempt from local taxes could be formed.  The development was only a limited success until 1991, when the United States invaded [[Panama]] to oust General [[Manuel Noriega]].  At the time Panama was one of the largest providers of offshore financial services in the world, but the business fled subsequent the invasion, and the British Virgin Islands was one of the main beneficiaries.  

In 2000, [[KPMG]] were commissioned by the British Government to produce a report on the offshore financial industry generally, and the report indicated that nearly 41% of the offshore companies in the world were formed in the British Virgin Islands.  The British Virgin Islands is now one of the [[Offshore Financial Centre#List of main offshore financial centres|world's leading offshore financial centres]], and boasts one of the highest incomes per capita in the Caribbean.
