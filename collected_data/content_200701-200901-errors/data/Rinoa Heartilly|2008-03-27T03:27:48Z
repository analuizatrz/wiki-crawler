{{nihongo|'''Rinoa Heartilly'''|リノア・ハーティリー|Rinoa Hātirī}} is the female lead of [[Square Co.|Square]]'s (now [[Square Enix]]) ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''. She is the seventeen year old daughter<ref name="Manual6">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VIII North American instruction manual | pages=6-9 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SLUS-00892GH}}</ref> of [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#General Caraway|General Caraway]], a high-ranking officer in the Galbadian army, and [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Julia|Julia Heartilly]], a famous singer and former love interest of [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Laguna|Laguna Loire]].<ref name="CarawayandJulia">'''Kiros:''' "Heard she recently got married." / '''Raine:''' "Oh yeah! To some army general, right? General Caraway or something?" / '''Kiros:''' "I'm not too sure." / '''Raine:''' "I read in a magazine that her true love went off to war and never came back. General Caraway comforted her while she was feeling down. That's how they got to know each other." (''Final Fantasy VIII''</ref><ref name="Caraway">'''Squall:''' "Where's Rinoa?" / '''General Caraway:''' "She has not receive the type of training you all have, and may become a burden. It's for the best that she stays out of this operation." / '''Selphie:''' "So you're Rinoa's father?" / '''General Caraway:''' "I can't remember the last time she called me that." / '''Zell:''' "So the father's a top military officer, and the daughter's a member of an anti-government faction!? That's bad... Really BAD!" / '''General Caraway:''' "Yes, indeed. It's a serious problem. But it doesn't concern you. It's our problem." {''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Throughout the game, she falls in love with the protagonist, [[Squall Leonhart]].<ref name="ignreview">{{cite web | author=Lundigran, Jeff | date=1999 | title=Final Fantasy VIII Review | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/153/153847p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref><ref name="Manual6"/><ref name="gamerevolution">{{cite web | author=Liu, Johnny | year=1999 | title=Game Revolution Review Page - ''Final Fantasy VIII'' | url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/sony/rpg/final_fantasy_8.htm | publisher=[[Game Revolution]] | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> She has black hair with brown highlights and dark eyes. Rinoa and Squall are featured in the electronic board game ''[[Itadaki Street Special]]''.

==Development==
When designing Rinoa, [[Tetsuya Nomura]] emphasized that he tried to avoid letting the possibilities presented by the recent advancements in [[full motion video]] technology become the entire focus, believing that these innovations might tempt developers to make their female characters "too beautiful" and focus more on physical appearance than personality. With this concern in mind, Nomura set out with the intention to avoid making Rinoa gorgeous, and to simply make her "[[cuteness|cute]]" instead. To further emphasise this, he wrote a list of vocabulary traits and physical habits for Rinoa's character that he felt conveyed this idea of "cute, not gorgeous," and sent them to Nojima along with the character's design.<ref name="shella">{{cite web | last=Khosla|first=Sheila | date=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | publisher=FLAREgamer | accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref>

==''Final Fantasy VIII''==
Outspoken, spirited, emotional, and honest with her feelings, she speaks her mind without reservation.<ref name="Manual6"/> Because of her ambition, she can often be stubborn.<ref name="Manual6"/> The year before the game begins, she was romantically involved with Squall's long-standing rival [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Seifer|Seifer Almasy]].<ref>'''Rinoa:''' "I don't really know. I... I think it was love. I wonder how [Seifer] felt...? ...It was last summer... I was 16." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Rinoa's weapon of choice is the ''Blaster Edge'', a bladed ring mounted to her wrist that acts much like a [[boomerang]].<ref name="Squareprofile"/>  She is assisted by her faithful dog, Angelo, during battle.<ref name="LimitBreak"/> Later in the game, she acquires a secondary limit break called ''Angel Wing'', in which she becomes uncontrollable for the remainder of the battle, acting on her own by casting spells with greatly increased power.

In the game, Rinoa is a member of the "[[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Forest Owls|Forest Owls]]", a small resistance faction seeking to liberate the small nation of Timber from Galbadian occupation.<ref>'''Zone:''' "Just stand anywhere you want. This is a full-scale operation. Our resistance, 'The Forest Owls', will be forever known in the pages of Timber's independance! Exciting, huh? It all started when we got a hold of top-secret info from Galbadia." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> She is called the "princess" of the group.<ref>'''Zone:''' "Just take it easy. Here, let me introduce you. Looks like you already met Watts. I guess it's just our princess then." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Rinoa first meets Squall at the SeeD inauguration ball at [[Garden (Final Fantasy VIII)#Balamb Garden|Balamb Garden]]. During the dance, she manages to charm the usually antisocial Squall<ref name="Manual6"/> into dancing with her.<ref>'''Rinoa:''' "SeeD members dance quite well, don't they?" / '''Squall:''' "Approach your target inconspicuously at a dance party... There may be missions requiring this sort of subterfuge. It's expected of SeeD to learn various skills." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Her purpose for visiting the Garden is revealed when the Forest Owls hire Squall, [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Zell|Zell Dincht]], and [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Selphie|Selphie Tilmitt]] as mercenaries. She clashes with Squall during a Forest Owls operation,<ref>'''Rinoa:''' "...Tell me. This is an order. An order from your client!" / '''Squall:''' "How serious are you...? Really...? The 3 of you plop down on the floor to discuss strategy? On top of that, you can't make a decision without our input, right? How do you think we feel, working for such an organization?" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> resulting in her brief departure. However, she decides to stay with them as they are forced to flee Timber, and ends up traveling along with them. At the end of disk one, Rinoa is reunited with her father, with whom she has a rocky relationship.<ref name="Caraway"/>

On disk two, she shares a moment with Squall at Fishermans Horizon, during a concert performed by the remaining party members.<ref>'''Rinoa:''' "Fine... I guess I'll have to bug you for the rest of the night. And I'm gonna keep chanting 'concert, concert, concert' and drive you nuts. Is that what you want?" / '''Squall:''' "...Oh man..." / '''Rinoa:''' "I'm getting to you already, huh? Looks like you have no choice!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> After this, both characters become aware of people's efforts to force them into a relationship.<ref>'''Rinoa:''' "So that's what you call it. You know Zell said he'll make me one exactly like it. Who knows, maybe I can become like a lion, too. That'd be crazy, huh!? I mean, everyone might, y'know, get the wrong idea about us." / '''Squall:''' (If it's so crazy, why do you sound so delighted? Everyone is trying to get us together. It's so obvious even I can tell.) "You sound like you want everyone to get the wrong idea." / '''Rinoa:''' "No-no-no-no-no!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> The party soon learns that Rinoa is the only main character who did not spend time at Edea's Orphanage.<ref>'''Irvine:''' "Seifer was there, too. Except for Rinoa, we were all there." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Later, Rinoa is possessed by [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Ultimecia|Ultimecia]] when she loses her influence over [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Edea|Sorceress Edea]], which causes Rinoa to fall into a [[coma]]-like state. Consequently, Squall tries desperately to revive her, eventually traveling to the country of Esthar.<ref>'''Zell:''' "Is the princess still asleep?" / '''Quistis:''' "She might wake up with a kiss from the prince." / '''Squall:''' "Is that why you came all the way out here? To tell me that?" / '''Quistis:''' "You're going to Esthar, right? We're coming, too." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> However, Ultimecia manages to use Rinoa to release [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Adel|Sorceress Adel]] from her orbital prison.<ref>'''Rinoa:''' "But Edea's still... I can't guarantee anything, either, if Ultimecia possesses me again... You saw me. She controlled me in outer space and made me break Adel's seal. What might happen next time? What will I end up doing? Will I end up fighting everyone? ...Scary thought, isn't it?" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref>

[[Image:SnRembracescene.JPG|thumb|Squall and Rinoa embrace after he frees her from confinement in Esthar]]
After Rinoa's use expires, Ultimecia possesses Adel and leaves Rinoa to die in space.  Squall rescues her, and the two attempt to share a personal moment on the Ragnarok spaceship while the game's theme song, "[[Music of Final Fantasy VIII#Eyes On Me|Eyes On Me]]", plays in the background.<ref>'''Squall:''' "Why are you holding onto me like this?" / '''Rinoa:''' "You don't like this, Squall?" / '''Squall:''' "Just not used to it." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref><ref>'''Rinoa:''' "I don't want the future. I want the present to stand still. I want to stay here with you..." / '''Squall:''' (Rinoa...) / '''Squall:''' (I don't know what to do... This is just another crossroad in my life. But, for the first time, I don't know which way to go. I've come this far because I've...fallen for you. ......Rinoa...... Now...am I just supposed to let you go?" / '''Voice:''' "Respond, Ragnarok!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> While this is happening, Squall discovers that Edea's power had been passed to Rinoa, turning her into a Sorceress.<ref>'''Voice:''' "Rinoa? The sorceress!?" She's on the ship!?" / '''Squall:''' (So... It's true? Rinoa is a sorceress?) / '''Rinoa:''' "I've...become a sorceress. I can't stay with you anymore, Squall." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> When they land, Rinoa is sent to the Sorceress Memorial by Esthar, who fear her sorceress powers; however, Squall is convinced by his party members to rescue her.<ref>'''Squall:''' (A fool, huh?) "...Maybe." (What am I doing...? I may never get to hear Rinoa's voice ever again... What the hell am I doing? What can I do? ...Of course...) / '''Quistis:''' "Have you decided?" / '''Zell:''' "Heading to Esthar, right?" / '''Squall:''' "Pandora whatever and Sorceress Adel are out of my hands. I don't even know where to look for Sis. The only think I know is Rinoa. The only thing I want to do for sure right now is for Rinoa. We're going to get Rinoa back!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> The two share an embrace at the Sorceress Memorial, which is also depicted in the opening cutscene, and continue their quest. During the game's ending, she reunites with Squall, and kisses him for the first time on the Balamb Garden balcony.

==Reception and criticism==
Although Squall and Rinoa clearly develop a relationship, it is never explicit until the final cutscene. [[IGN]] criticized this, stating that "considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens — not to mention forming the central image of the box art — it's incomprehensible why no one says "I love you" to anyone, ever."<ref name="ignreview"/> [[Game Revolution]], however, stated "Frankly, you don't even have to play the game to know that love will win out in some way...very 'Hollywood.' But it is the way in which they tell the story that sets it apart from being just some teen-angst drama".<ref name="gamerevolution"/>

In terms of Rinoa herself, when the Game Revolution reviewer cited the wish that the game had [[voice acting]], he specifically mentioned Rinoa, stating "there is something sorely missing when I can't hear Rinoa talk".<ref name="gamerevolution"/> She is also the subject of numerous fansites, as well as an 8.0 rating on WomenGamers.com.<ref name="WomenGamers">{{cite web|url=http://www.womengamers.com/dw/rinoa.php|title=Rinoa Heartilly review|publisher=WomenGamers.com|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref>
