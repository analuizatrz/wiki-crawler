Australian Hospital Ship '''AHS ''Centaur''''' was a former ocean liner converted to a [[hospital ship]] and attached to [[Australian]] naval forces during [[World War II]]. Built in [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]] in 1924, the 3,066 ton vessel operated with the [[Ocean Steamship Company]] (Blue Funnel Line). ''Centaur'' was convered in 1943 and commissioned as a hospital ship on 12 March, 1943. 

==Sinking==
At approximately 4.07 am on [[14 May]], [[1943]], while on her second run from [[Sydney]] to [[Port Moresby]], [[New Guinea]], ''Centaur'' was torpedoed by the [[Japanese Navy]] submarine I-177, commanded by Hajime Nakagawa. The torpedo struck ''Centaur'' on the port side, sinking the ship. ''Centaur'' is recorded to have sunk at 4.10 am, at a point 24 nautical miles east-northeast of [[Point Lookout, Queensland|Point Lookout]], [[North Stradbroke Island]], [[Queensland]]. <ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=A Critical Vulnerability - The Impact of the Submarine Threat on Australia’s Maritime Defence (1915-1954)|origdate= |origyear=2005 |origmonth=June |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/spc/maritimepapers/piama15/piama15_full.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Sea Power Centre – Australia |location= |language= |isbn=0-642-29625-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p. 358 |chapter=Appendix V|chapterurl=http://www.navy.gov.au/spc/maritimepapers/piama15/piama15_appendices.pdf |quote= }} </ref> The rapid sinking of ''Centaur'' prevented the deployment of life rafts, and several who escaped the ship were killed by shrapnel or burning fuel-oil. The ship was well illuminated and marked as a hospital ship, and the act of sinking a ship so marked was considered to be a [[war crime]]. The sinking of ''Centaur'' drew strong reactions from General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]]. The Japanese acknowledged the role of I-177 in 1979, in an official history. <ref name="HeraldTimeline">{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Stephens |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Birthday beers spared George |url= |format= |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=John Fairfax Holdings |id= |pages= |page=20 |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate= |language= |quote= }}</ref>

At the time of the sinking, there were 332 persons onboard, broken down as 75 [[Merchant Navy]] crew, 65 ship's [[Australian Army]] medical staff including 12 nurses, and 192 members of the Army's 2/12th Field Ambulance, who were being transported to establish and reinforce various medical units. Of these, only 64 survived, with only one survivor from the port side of the ship. The survivors spent thirty-six hours clinging to debris before they were rescued  by the [[United States Navy]] ship [[USS Mugford (DD-389)|USS ''Mugford'']]. <ref name="HeraldTimeline"/>

==Memorial==
The Centaur memorial is at Point Danger, [[Coolangatta, Queensland]]. It consists of a monumental stone topped with a cairn, surrounded by a tiled moat with memorial plaques explaining the commemoration. The memorial is in turn surrounded by a park with a boardwalk, overlooking the sea, that has plaques for other ships lost during World War II, including both Merchant and [[Royal Australian Navy]] ships. (34 ships were attacked off the east coast of Australia; of these 13 were torpedoed but did not sink; of the 4 struck by mines, 1 sank.) 

The memorial was unveiled on the 50th anniversary of the sinking, [[14 May]] [[1993]], by Minister for Veteran's Affairs, [[Australian Senate|Senator]] the Honourable [[John Faulkner]]. Apart from Australian survivors and local dignitaries, a contingent from USS ''Mugford'' traveled from the [[United States]] for the event.
