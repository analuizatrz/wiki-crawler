[[Image:Stephen Weiss.jpg|thumb|250px|A player taking a backhander]]'''Ice hockey''', often referred to simply as '''hockey''' in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], is a team [[sport]] played on [[ice]]. It is a speedy and physical sport. Ice hockey is most popular in areas that are sufficiently cold for natural, reliable seasonal ice cover. It is one of the four [[major professional sports league|major North American professional sports]], and is represented by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) at the highest level, and the [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL), the highest level of women's ice hockey in the world. It is the official [[national pastime|national winter sport]] of Canada, where the game enjoys immense popularity, and is also the most popular spectator sport in [[Finland]]. Only six of the thirty NHL franchises are based in Canada, but Canadian players outnumber Americans in the league by a ratio of almost four to one. About thirty percent of the league's players are non-North American. 

The sport's popularity in the U.S. is concentrated in certain regions, notably the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], the [[Midwest]], and [[Alaska]]. This concentration helps to make ice hockey the least watched major sport in the [[United States]], though it is by far the most watched sport in [[Canada]].  Nonetheless, in certain major U.S. cities (notably [[Buffalo Sabres|Buffalo]], [[Detroit Red Wings|Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Pittsburgh]], [[Minnesota Wild|Minneapolis]], [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago]], [[Boston Bruins|Boston]], [[New York Rangers|New York City]], [[Philadelphia Flyers|Philadelphia]], [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Tampa]] [[Colorado Avalanche|Denver]], and [[Columbus Blue Jackets|Columbus]]) it commands popularity levels similar to and occasionally exceeding [[basketball]] for winter sports fans. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Ice hockey is a physically demanding sport, due to the high tempo and quick changes in puck possession during a typical game. On a full-sized rink, a player who merely coasts or who is relatively stationary will be of little use to his or her team. Players may leave play and return later, so, in a competitive game, they typically play in shifts of from thirty to forty-five seconds to maintain the fast pace.

While there are 64 total members of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), [[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United States]] have finished in most of the coveted 1st, 2nd and 3rd places at [[IIHF World Championships]]. Of the 63 medals awarded in men's competition at the Olympic level from 1920 on, only six did not go to the one of those countries, or a former entity thereof, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]]. Only one of those six medals was above bronze.  Those seven nations have also captured 162 of 177 medals awarded at 59 non-Olympic [[IIHF World Championships]], and all medals since 1954. Likewise, all nine Olympic and 27 [[IIHF World Women Championships]] medals have gone to one of those seven countries.  Also deserving of mention is [[Switzerland]], which has won two men's bronze medals at the Olympics and finished at least third seven times at the World Championships.  Switzerland also maintains one of the oldest and top-rated ice hockey leagues ([[Nationalliga A|the Swiss Nationalliga]]) outside of the NHL.<ref>{{cite web | last=National Hockey League | authorlink=National Hockey League | title=Hockey a hot ticket in Switzerland | url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=278996 | accessdate=October 24 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==History==
[[image:SCENEONICE.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dutch burghers playing a game that looks much like ice hockey.]]

Games between teams hitting an object with curved sticks have been played throughout history; 4000 year-old drawings at the Beni-Hasen tombs in [[Egypt]] depict a sport resembling [[field hockey]].<ref>{{cite web | last=USA Field Hockey | title=Field Hockey History & Tradition | url=http://www.usfieldhockey.com/history/index.htm | accessdate=October 12|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The 1527 Galway Statutes in [[Ireland]] made reference to ''"the horlinge of the litill balle with hockie stickes or staves."''<ref>{{cite journal | last=MacLennan | first=H.D. | title=Shinty in England, Pre-1893 | journal=The Sports Historian | volume=19 | issue=2 | pages=43-60 | date=November, 1999 | url=http://www.aafla.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/1999/sh192e.pdf}}
</ref> The [[etymology]] of the word hockey is uncertain. It may derive from the [[Old French]] word ''hoquet'', [[shepherd's crook]], or from the [[Middle Dutch]] word ''hokkie'', meaning [[shack]] or [[doghouse]], which in popular use meant [[Goal (ice hockey)|goal]]. Many of these games were developed for fields, though where conditions allowed they were also played on ice. 16th-century [[Dutch paintings]] show townsfolk playing a hockey-like game on a frozen [[canal]].

European immigrants brought various versions of hockey-like games to North America, such as the [[Scotland|Scottish]] sport of [[shinty]], the closely-related [[Ireland|Irish]] sport of [[hurling]], and versions of field hockey played in England. Where necessary these seem to have been adapted for icy conditions; for example, a colonial [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] newspaper records hockey being played in a [[snow storm]] in Virginia. Both [[English language|English]]- and [[French language|French]]-speaking Canadians played hockey on frozen rivers, lakes, and ponds using cheese cutters strapped to their boots {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and early paintings show hockey being played in [[Nova Scotia]]. Author [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton]] wrote of boys from King's College School in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]], [[Nova Scotia]], playing ''"hurley on the ice"'' when he was a student there around 1800.<ref>{{cite web | title=Birthplace of Ice Hockey | url=http://www.birthplaceofhockey.com | accessdate=April 15|accessyear=2006}}</ref> To this day, "[[Shinny]]" (derived from Shinty) is a popular [[Canadian]] term for an informal type of hockey, either on ice or as [[street hockey]]. These early games may have also absorbed the physically aggressive aspects of what the [[Mi'kmaq]] [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] [[First Nation]] in [[Nova Scotia]] called ''dehuntshigwa'es'' ([[lacrosse]]).  

In 1825 [[John Franklin|Sir John Franklin]] wrote that ''"The game of hockey played on the ice was the morning sport"'' while on [[Great Bear Lake]] during one of his [[Arctic]] expeditions.  In 1843 a British Army officer in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]], wrote ''"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice."''<ref name='queens'>{{cite web | title=Hockey night in Kingston| url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 | accessdate=June 21|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The Society for International Hockey Research contends, based on a Boston Evening Gazette article from 1859, that an early game of hockey on ice occurred in Halifax in that year. The first game to use a puck rather than a ball took place in 1860 on Kingston Harbour, involving mostly [[Crimean War]] veterans.

Based on Haliburton's writings, there have been claims that modern ice hockey originated in Windsor, Nova Scotia, and was named after an individual, as in 'Colonel Hockey's game'.<ref>Garth Vaughan, ''The Puck Stops Here: The origin of Canada's great winter game'', Fredericton: [[Goose Lane Editions]], 1996, p. 23.</ref> Proponents of this theory state that the surname ''Hockey'' exists in the district surrounding Windsor. In 1943, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association declared Kingston the birthplace of hockey, based on a recorded 1886 game played between students of [[Queen's University]] and the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].

===Foundation of the modern game ===
[[image:McGill Hockey 1901.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ice hockey at McGill University, Montreal, 1901.]]
[[Image:Silver7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ottawa Hockey Club "Silver Seven", the Champion of the [[Stanley Cup]] in 1905]]

The foundation of the modern game centered on [[Montreal]]. On March 3, 1875 the first organized indoor game was played at Montreal's Victoria Rink by [[James Creighton (hockey)|James Creighton]] and several [[McGill University]] students. In 1877, several McGill students, including Creighton, [[Henry Joseph]], [[Richard F. Smith]], [[W.F. Robertson]], and [[W.L. Murray]] codified seven ice hockey rules. The first ice hockey club, McGill University Hockey Club, was founded in 1880.<ref>{{cite web | last=Zukerman | first=Earl | title= McGill’s contribution to the origins of ice hockey | date=March 17, 2005 | url=http://www.athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=81 | accessdate=October 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The game became so popular that it was featured in Montreal's annual Winter Carnival in 1883. In 1885, A.P. Low introduced the game to [[Ottawa]]. During the same year, the [[Oxford University Ice Hockey Club]] was formed to play the first [[Ice Hockey Varsity Match]] against traditional rival [[Cambridge University Ice Hockey Club|Cambridge]] in St. Moritz, Switzerland. This match was won by the Oxford Dark Blues, 6-0.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Talbot | first=Michael | title=On Frozen Ponds | journal=Macleans | date=March 5, 2001 | url=http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/canada/article.jsp?content=47048#continue}}</ref><ref>Cambridge Evening News, "Sporting Heritage is Found", July 26, 2003.</ref> The first photographs and team lists date from 1895.<ref>{{cite web | last=Oxford University Ice Hockey Club | title=History | url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ouihc/history.html | accessdate=October 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This continues to be the oldest hockey rivalry in history.

In 1888, the new [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley of Preston]], whose sons and daughter became hockey enthusiasts, attended the Carnival and was impressed with the hockey spectacle. In 1892, recognizing that there was no recognition for the best team, he purchased a decorative bowl for use as a trophy. The Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, which later became  more famously known as the [[Stanley Cup]], was first awarded in 1893 to the champion amateur team in Canada, [[Montreal AAA]]. It continues to be awarded today to the [[NHL|National Hockey League]]'s championship team.<ref>{{cite book | last=Podnieks | first=Andrew|coauthors=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] | title=Lord Stanley's Cup | year=2004 | publisher=Triumph Books| id=ISBN 1-55168-261-3}}</ref>

By 1893, there were almost a hundred teams in Montreal alone, and leagues throughout Canada. [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] hockey players had incorporated [[cricket]] pads to better protect the [[goaltender|goaltender's]] legs. They also introduced the "scoop" shot, later known as the wrist shot.

1893 also saw the first ice hockey matches in the U.S., at [[Yale University]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Hockey (Ice) | encyclopedia = The Canadian Encyclopedia | publisher = Historica Foundation of Canada | date = 2006|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0003794}}</ref> The U.S. Amateur Hockey League was founded in [[New York City]] in 1896, and the first professional team, the [[Portage Lakers]] was formed in 1903 in [[Houghton, Michigan]] (although there had been individual professionals in Canada before this).

The five sons of Lord Stanley were instrumental in bringing ice hockey to Europe, beating a court team (which included both the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]) at [[Buckingham Palace]] in 1895. By 1903 a five-team league had been founded. The Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace was founded in 1908 to govern international competitions, and the first European championships were won by Great Britain in 1910. In the mid-20th century, the Ligue became the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]].<ref>{{cite web | last=International Ice Hockey Federation | authorlink=International Ice Hockey Federation | title=History of Ice Hockey | url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf/history/history.htm | accessdate=October 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|250px|right|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]

While the general characteristics of the game are the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used. The two most important codes are those of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF)<ref>{{cite book | last=International Ice Hockey Federation | authorlink=International Ice Hockey Federation | title= Official Rule Book 2002-2006 | date=September 2002 |url=http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf}}</ref> and of the North American [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).<ref>{{cite book | last=National Hockey League | authorlink=National Hockey League | title=Official Rules 2006-07 | publisher=Triumph Books | date=2006 | location=Chicago, USA |url=http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf|id=ISBN 1-894801-03-2}}</ref> North American amateur hockey codes, such as those of [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]], tend to be a hybrid of the NHL and IIHF codes, while professional rules generally follow those of the NHL.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

Ice hockey is played on a ''[[hockey rink]]''. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, each of whom is on ''[[ice skate]]s''.  There are five players and one ''[[goaltender]]'' per side. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[rubber]] disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players may control the puck using a long [[Hockey stick|stick]] with a blade that is commonly curved at one end. Players may also redirect the puck with any part of their bodies, subject to certain restrictions. Players can angle their feet so the puck can redirect into the net, but there can be no kicking motion.  Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.

Hockey is an "offside" game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s hockey was an onside game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. The period of the onside game was the golden age of stick-handling, which was of prime importance in moving the game forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a truly team sport, where individual heroics diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.<ref>{{cite book | last=Dryden | first=Ken | authorlink=Ken Dryden | title=The Game | date=1999 | id= ISBN 0-7715-7673-0}}</ref>

The other five players are typically divided into three forwards and two defencemen. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair, but may change less frequently than the forwards. A substitution of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[shorthanded]]'' or on a ''[[powerplay|power play]]''. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the course of the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005-2006 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.

The boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play (they can also be used as tools to play the puck), and play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a ''[[faceoff]]''. There are two major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: ''[[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]]'' and ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]''.

Under IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18 plus two goaltenders.

==Penalties==
[[image:hockeyfight.JPG|thumb|280px|Altercations often occur near the goal after a stoppage of play, since defensive players are extremely concerned with protecting their [[goaltender]].  All rulebooks call for penalties if an offensive player interferes with a goaltender's ability to defend the goal.]]
{{main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}
For most penalties, the offending player is sent to the ''[[penalty box]]'' and his team has to play without him and with one less skater for a short amount of time.  Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed. This gives the other team what is popularly termed a ''[[power play]]''.

A two-minute ''minor penalty'' is often called for lesser infractions such as tripping, elbowing, roughing, high-sticking, too many players on the ice, illegal equipment, charging (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, interference, delay of game, hooking, or cross-checking. More egregious fouls of this type may be penalized by a four-minute ''double-minor'' penalty, particularly those which (inadvertently) cause injury to the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or the other team scores on the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score (effectively expiring the first minor). Five-minute ''major penalties'' are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. The foul of 'boarding', defined as "check<nowiki>[ing]</nowiki> an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards" by the [http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule44.html NHL Rulebook] is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violence of the hit. A minor or major penalty for "Boarding" is also often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.

Some varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, they both serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In that case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder); this applies regardless of current pending penalties, though in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In that case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if a minor or major is assessed in addition, a designated player must serve out that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned "two-and-ten").

A player who is tripped, or illegally obstructed in some way, by an opponent on a ''[[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]''&nbsp;&ndash; when there are no defenders except the goaltender between him and the opponent's goal&nbsp;&ndash; is awarded a ''[[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]'', an attempt to score without opposition from any defenders except the goaltender. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway in order to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.
[[Image:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]

Officials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game). In the NHL, there is an area behind the goal line that goaltenders are not allowed to play the puck.  Doing so also results in a delay of game minor.

A new penalty in the NHL applies to the goalies.  The goalies now are unable to play the puck in the "corners" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. The area immediately behind the net is the only area behind the net in which the goalie can play the puck.

An additional rule that is not a penalty in the new NHL is the two line offside passes. There are no more two-line offside pass whistles blown.  Now players are able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.

The NHL has taken steps to speed the game of hockey up and create a game of finesse, which is different from the past where hockey was a game of hits, fights, and penalties.  Today's game of hockey is a stricter called game which in-turn provides more protection to the players and allows for more goals to be scored.

There are many infractions for which a player may be assessed a ''[[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]]''. The governing body for United States amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game ("Zero Tolerance").

In men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. (In the NHL, you can hit an opposing player only for a brief moment after he loses control of the puck -usually less than 3 seconds- without incurring a penalty.) {{Fact|date=February 2007}} This use of the hip and shoulder is called ''body [[Checking (ice hockey)|checking]].'' Not all physical contact is legal &mdash; in particular, hits from behind and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.

==Officials==

{{main|Official (ice hockey)}}

A typical game of ice hockey has two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|official]]s'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are responsible only for calling offside and [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]] violations, and one or two ''referees'', who call goals and all other penalties. ''Linesmen'' can, however, report to the ''referee(s)'' that a penalty more severe than a two-minute minor penalty should be assessed against an offending player.  On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.

Officials are selected by the league for which they work.  Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests.  Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.  USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.

==Tactics==
[[Image:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Winning the [[faceoff]] can be the key to some strategies. A game between [[Saginaw]] and [[Plymouth]]'s [[Ontario Hockey League]] teams.]]

An important defensive tactic is ''[[Checking (hockey)|checking]]''&nbsp;&ndash; attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Forechecking'' is checking in the other team's zone; ''backchecking'' is checking while the other team is advancing down the ice toward one's own goal. These terms usually are applied to checking by forwards. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (within a short period of time after possession; usually less than three seconds). Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.

Offensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to [[Shot (hockey)|shoot the puck]].
[[Image:Peter Bondra scoring.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Peter Bondra]] of the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] [[Shot (hockey)|shoots the puck]] and scores behind [[Roberto Luongo]] of the [[Florida Panthers]]]]



A ''deflection'' is a shot which redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''one-timer'' is a shot which is struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. A ''deke'' (short for ''decoy'') is a feint with the body and/or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. ''Headmanning the puck'' is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice.

A team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play may elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, removing the goaltender and replacing him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, this tactic is extremely risky, and sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.

Although it is officially prohibited in the rules, at the professional level in North America [[Fighting in hockey|fights]] are sometimes used to affect morale of the teams, with aggressors hoping to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. Both players in an altercation receive five-minute major penalties for fighting. The player deemed to be the "instigator" of an NHL fight, if one is determined to exist, is penalized an additional two minutes for instigating, plus a ten-minute misconduct penalty. If there is no instigator, both players stay in the penalty box for five minutes, and neither team loses skaters. This so-called instigator rule is highly controversial in NHL hockey: many coaches, sportswriters, players and fans feel it prevents players from effectively policing the objectionable behavior of their peers, which is often cleverly hidden from referees. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} They point to less extreme on-ice violence during the era before the rule was introduced. [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner [[Conn Smythe]] famously observed that "If you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat 'em on the ice." <ref>http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCM/is_3_29/ai_67492139/pg_2 }}</ref>
[[Image:Ottawa v Tampa Bay refs goal fight April 22 2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A fight during the game between the [[Ottawa Senators]] and the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] for the 2006 [[Stanley Cup]]]]

The Neutral zone trap:<br />
The trap is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. In youth hockey development of the neutral zone trap often begins with the left wing lock. In this tactic the left wing plays in the normal position of the left defence men while in the offensive zone. The left defenceman then moves to the centre.  The centre and right wing chase the puck.  When the opposing team gains control of the puck, the defencemen and the left wing pull out and set a two man trap along the boards.  The left or right wing available, backs up the trap while the centre and right wing pursuit and try to get in front of the play further blocking the offensive attack.

==Periods and overtime==
A game consists of three ''periods'' of twenty minutes each, the clock running only when the puck is in play. In international play, the teams change ends for the second period, again for the third period, and again after ten minutes of the third period. In many North American leagues, including the NHL, the last change is omitted. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.

Various procedures are used if a game is tied. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play 20 minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999-2000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single 5 minute sudden death period with 5 players (plus a goalie) per side, with the winner awarded 2 points in the standings and the loser 0 points. In the event of a tie (if the OT was scoreless), each team was awarded 1 point. From 1999-2000 until 2003-04 the [[National Hockey League]] decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having 4 players (plus a goalie) per side to "open-up" the game. In the event of a tie, each team would still receive 1 point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded 2 points in the standings and the losing team 1 point. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an 'Empty Net' goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss.  International play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period followed by a [[Overtime (ice hockey)#Shoot out|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]s. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''sudden death'' (actually sudden victory) format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided by a shootout the winning team is awarded 2 points in the standings and the losing team is awarded 1. Ties no longer occur in the [[NHL]]. Also, no statistics in the shootout count-no goals are awarded to players who score in the shootout, and goalkeepers are not credited with saves or goals against. Therefore, it is possible for a goalie to lose a game in which he gets a shutout. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Women's ice hockey==
[[Image:Womenplayinghockey.jpg|right|thumb|Women playing hockey at [[Rideau Hall]] circa 1890 (earliest known image of women's hockey)]]

Ice hockey is one of the fastest growing women's sports in the world, with the number of participants increasing 400 percent in the last 10 years.<ref>{{cite web | title=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html | url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html | accessdate=December 4 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> While there are not as many organized leagues for women as there are for men, there exist leagues of all levels, including the [[National Women's Hockey League]], [[Western Women's Hockey League]], and various European leagues; as well as university teams, national and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] teams, and [[recreation]]al teams. There have been nine [[IIHF World Women Championships]].<ref name="IIHF WWC list">{{cite web|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]|url=http://www.iihf.com//archive/WW.pdf|format=PDF|title=IIHF World Women Championships|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>
[[Image:Girls ice hockey team 1921.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A girls ice hockey team in 1921]]
Women's ice hockey was added as a medal sport at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Japan]]. The United States won gold, Canada won silver and Finland won bronze.<ref name="Hunter 1998 Olympics">{{cite web|author=Andria Hunter|title=1998 Winter Olympics|url=http://www.whockey.com/int/olympics/1998/|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

The chief difference between women's and men's ice hockey is that bodychecking is not allowed in women's ice hockey. After the 1990 Women's World Championship, bodychecking was eliminated because female players in many countries do not have the size and mass seen in North American players. There are many who feel that the relative lack of physical play is a detriment to its popularity among the mainstream hockey public, while others feel its absence leads to a faster game more reliant on skating and puck-handling skills. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} In current IIHF women's competition, bodychecking is either a minor or major [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]], decided at the referee's discretion.<ref name="IIHF Rules Section 6">{{cite web|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]|title=Section 6 - Specific Rules|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/rules/img/sec6.pdf|format=PDF|work=International Ice Hockey Federation Official Rule Book|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

In addition, players in women's competition are required to wear protective full-[[hockey mask|face masks]].<ref name="IIHF Rules Section 6"/>

One woman, [[Manon Rhéaume]], appeared as a goaltender for the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in preseason games against the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] and the [[Boston Bruins]], and in 2003 [[Hayley Wickenheiser]] played with the [[Kirkkonummi]] [[HC Salamat|Salamat]] in the [[Finland|Finnish]] men's [[Suomi-sarja]] league. Several women have competed in North American minor leagues, including goaltenders [[Charline Labonté]], [[Kelly Dyer]], [[Erin Whitten]], [[Manon Rhéaume]], and defenceman [[Angela Ruggiero]].

==Sledge hockey==
{{main|Sledge hockey}}

[[Sledge hockey]] is a form of ice hockey designed for players with physical [[disability|disabilities]] affecting their lower bodies. Players sit on double-bladed [[sled|sledges]] and use two sticks; each stick has a blade at one end and small picks at the other. Players use the sticks to pass, stickhandle and shoot the puck, and to propel their sledges. The rules are very similar to [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] ice hockey rules.<ref>{{cite web | last=International Paralympic Committee | authorlink=International Paralympic Committee | title=Ice Sledge Hockey - Rulebook | url=http://www.paralympic.org/release/Winter_Sports/Ice_Sledge_Hockey/About_the_sport/Rules/ice_sledge_hockey_rulebook.pdf  | accessdate=October 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Canada]] is a recognized international leader in the development of the sport, and of equipment for players. Much of the equipment for the sport was first developed in Canada, such as sledge hockey sticks laminated with [[fiberglass]], as well as aluminum shafts with hand carved insert blades and special aluminum sledges with regulation skate blades.

==International competition==
[[Image:Schweden-lettland.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] vs [[Latvian national ice hockey team|Latvia]] in [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] 2005]]
The annual men's [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] are highly regarded by Europeans, but they are less important to North Americans because they coincide with the [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs. Consequently, Canada, the United States, and other countries with large numbers of NHL players have not always been able to field their best possible teams because many of their top players are playing for the Stanley Cup. Furthermore, for many years professionals were barred from play. Now that many Europeans play in the NHL, the world championships no longer represent all of the world's top players.

Hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924 (and at the summer games in 1920). Canada won six of the first seven gold medals. The United States won their first gold medal in 1960. The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] won all but two Olympic ice hockey gold medals from 1956 to 1988 and won a final time as the [[Unified Team]] at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville Olympics]]. Since all players in the communist system were "amateurs," the USSR's elite national team was the best the country had to offer, {{Fact|date=February 2007}}  while the best Americans, Swedes, Finns, and Canadians were professionals and thus barred from Olympic competition. Nonetheless, U.S. amateur college players defeated the heavily favored Soviet squad on the way to winning the [[gold medal]] at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]]. This "[[Miracle on Ice]]" launched a surge of newfound popularity for a game about which many Americans had not cared much. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] and [[1974 Summit Series]],  established [[Canada]] and the [[USSR]] as a major international ice hockey rivalry. It was followed by five [[Canada Cup]] tournaments, where the best players from every hockey nation could play, and two exhibition series, the 1979 [[1979 Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] and [[Rendez-vous '87 ]] where the best players from the NHL played the USSR. The Canada Cup tournament later became the [[World Cup of Hockey]], played in 1996 and 2004. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004. Since 1998, NHL professionals have played in the Olympics, giving the best players in the world more opportunities to face off.

There have been nine women's world championships, beginning in 1990.<ref name="IIHF WWC list"/> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name="Hunter 1998 Olympics"/> Currently Canada and the United States dominate the world scene. The [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden marked the first women's world championship or Olympic final that did not involve both Canada and the United States.

==Ice hockey in popular culture==
====Films====
Like all of the major sports, hockey plays a major part in American popular culture. Though it is the least popular of the four professional sports in the US ([[American football]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and hockey), a number of notable [[Hollywood]] films have been made about hockey. Notable hockey films include ''[[Slap Shot (movie)|Slap Shot]]'' (1977), ''[[The Mighty Ducks (movies)|The Mighty Ducks]]'' (1992, successful enough to spawn two sequels and an NHL team named the [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]), and ''[[Miracle (film)|Miracle]]'' (2004). The first two are fictional comedies; the last is a drama based on the true story of the 1980 "Miracle on Ice" USA Olympic gold medal team. Other hockey films include ''[[Youngblood (1986 movie)|Youngblood]],'' ''[[Hockey Night]]'', ''[[MVP: Most Valuable Primate]]'', ''[[H-E Double Hockey Sticks]]'', ''[[Mystery, Alaska]]'', ''[[The Rocket (film)|The Rocket: The Maurice Richard Story]]'', ''[[The Sweater]]'' and the 1937 [[John Wayne]] film ''Idol of the Crowds ''. Many other films are less hockey-oriented but nonetheless prominently involve the sport. Both ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' and ''[[The Cutting Edge]]'' centre around failed hockey players using their talents for other sports ([[golf]] and [[figure skating]], respectively), while ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' contains a number of prominent references to the sport during the film. The Jean-Claude Van Damme starrer ''[[Sudden Death]]'' (1995) is set and shot entirely in the [[Mellon Arena|Pittsburgh Civic Arena]], the (supposed) stage for the seventh game of the NHL Stanley Cup finals. While "[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]" was never a hockey movie, [[Chevy Chase]]'s lead character, Clark Griswold, was famous for wearing a light [[Chicago Blackhawks]] jersey with "Griswold" and the numbers "00" on it during certain scenes. It also plays a part in Disney Channel original movies ''Go Figure '' and [[Genius (film)|''Genius'']], and romantic comedy ''[[Just Friends]]''. In Quebec, the movie [[Les Boys]] is a cult classic for many hockey fans, enough to spawn 3 sequels. The fourth installement of Les Boys featured "Hockey Legends" such as [[Guy Lafleur]], [[Pierre Bouchard]], [[Martin Brodeur]], [[Yvon Lambert]] and more.

====American television====
Hockey also frequently shows up in American television, particularly in shows set in the colder regions of the US such as the Northeast. One of the recurring characters on ''[[Cheers]]'' was [[Eddie LeBec]], a [[French-Canadian]] [[Boston Bruins]] goalie who married cast regular [[Carla Tortelli]]. LeBec later was cut from the team and joined a traveling ice show; the character was eventually killed off. One memorable episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', "[[The Face Painter]]", involves the antics of Elaine's face-painting boyfriend Puddy, a rabid [[New Jersey Devils]] fan, and Jerry's stubborn refusal to thank an acquaintance for [[New York Rangers]] playoff tickets after the game when he had already thanked him numerous times beforehand. In ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', the character of PA Donna Abandando, played by [[Gail O'Grady]] and a love interest of Detective Greg Medavoy in season 3, was a noted New York Rangers fan, having previously dated one of the players. Her Rangers pennant famously hung over her desk at the front of the squad room. Many episodes of [[Home Improvement]] included references to the Detroit Red Wings and in one episode, Tim and his neighbour Wilson are at a game when Wilson wins the door prize. Actor [[Richard Dean Anderson]] has incorporated his personal love of hockey into two of his lead characters: [[MacGyver]], and ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'''s [[Jack O'Neill]]. In an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Lisa on Ice]]", Bart is the star of his peewee hockey team, the Mighty Pigs, coached by [[Chief Wiggum]]. Lisa is eventually forced to become a goaltender on an opposing team—the Kwik-E-Mart Gougers, coached by [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]]—to avoid a failing grade in [[physical education|gym]], and she blossoms from a nervous wreck to an intimidating star. Eventually, the two teams play each other. Towards the end of the game, Bart is awarded a penalty shot, but before he shoots, he thinks of all his memories with Lisa. Lisa does this as well, and the two embrace each other. The finishes with the two teams tying each other and furious fans destroying the hockey arena. More recently, the FX show [[Rescue Me (TV series)|''Rescue Me'']], which stars [[Denis Leary]], has featured hockey games as an integral part of several episodes; [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]rs and former [[Boston Bruins]] forwards [[Cam Neely]] and [[Phil Esposito]] have had cameos. Leary's character plays in the [[FDNY]] vs. [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] hockey game. Many ''[[Friends]]'' episodes also involve [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]], [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]], and [[Ross Geller|Ross]] attending [[New York Rangers]] games.  At the end of one episode of ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', Tony and Angela are at a hockey game.  Angela asks Tony what the red circle on the ice is for, and Tony indicates that it is blood (humorously furthering the [[stereotype]] of hockey violence). In ''[[Scrubs (TV show)|Scrubs]]'', [[Perry Cox|Dr. Cox]] frequently wears a [[Detroit Red Wings]] jersey while not at the hospital; this is because of [[John C. McGinley]]'s real-life friendship with Red Wings defenceman [[Chris Chelios]].  Hockey has also been referenced many times in the series of six movies known as the View Askew Movies, which were written and directed by Actor/Director/Writer/Hockey Fan, Kevin Smith.  His first movie, Clerks (1994), featured a street hockey game played on the roof of a store, however many of the players in the game wore ice hockey jerseys, including the New Jersey Devils, Pittsburgh Penguins, and a CCCP International Jersey.  Mall Rats (1995) featured character Brodie (Jason Lee) playing an ice hockey game for Sega Genesis.  Chasing Amy (1997) featured Joey Adams and Ben Afleck attending a high school ice hockey game.  The other 3 movies, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Clerks II didn't feature any ice hockey references, however Dogma did feature a street hockey reference.

====Canadian television====
Because of hockey's huge popularity in Canada, it is considered one of the most important elements of Canadian pop culture. It features often in homegrown television and movies, such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC Television]] series ''[[Hockey: A People's History]]'' and ''[[Hockeyville]]'', the [[Global TV]] reality show ''[[Making The Cut: Last Man Standing]]'', as well as scripted shows like [[CTV|CTV's]] ''[[Power Play (TV series)|Power Play]]'' (1998-2000) and [[Showcase|Showcase's]] [[Rent-A-Goalie|Rent-A-Goalie]] (2006-).

====Music====
Among the more famous hockey references in music is ''[[The Hockey Song]]'' by Canadian folk singer [[Stompin' Tom Connors]]. [[Warren Zevon]] is known for a hockey song called "Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)" from his 2002 album ''[[My Ride's Here]]''. The song's title is in reference to the commonplace fights that tend to break out between players during games and tells the tale of Buddy, a Canadian farmboy turned hockey goon.

There are several less well-known songs which either directly or indirectly feature hockey references and hockey teams, such as "Zamboni" (a reference to the machine used to resurface the ice between periods and after games) by the Gear Daddies; "Helmethead" by [[Great Big Sea]], which details the romantic exploits of an AHL player; and "Time to Go" by the Dropkick Murphys which references hockey directly, as well as the colours of Boston's NHL team, the Bruins (black and gold).

Canadian band [[The Tragically Hip]] has a number of songs that with hockey references, including "Fifty Mission Cap", about former [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Toronto Maple Leaf]] [[Bill Barilko]], "Fireworks", and "Lonely End of the Rink". Their song "Wheat Kings" is not about hockey, but the Wheat Kings is the name of a hockey team in [[Brandon, Manitoba]]). In addition, "Heaven Is a Better Place Today" is a tribute to the late hockey player [[Dan Snyder]].

Also, the American rock group [[Five for Fighting]], whose name is a hockey penalty reference chosen by singer [[John Ondrasik]], who is a major ice hockey fan. Also, L.A. hardcore band Donnybrook takes its name form a slang term referring to a fight between players during a hockey game.

The name of the Boston hardcore band [[Slapshot (band)|Slapshot]] is an ice hockey reference, and they have taken this concept further with the album titles ''Sudden Death Overtime'' and ''Greatest Hits, Slashes and Crosschecks''.

==Attendance records==
===The Cold War===

The largest hockey attendance in history was on October 6, 2001, for a game commonly known as the Cold War. Two college hockey rivals, [[University of Michigan]] and [[Michigan State University]], opened their season with a game in Michigan State's outdoor football arena, [[Spartan Stadium]]. A $500,000 sheet of ice was used, and the temperature was 30° F. The game drew a record breaking 74,554 spectators, smashing the previous number of 55,000 attendence during the Sweden vs. Soviet Union game during the world championship in [[Moscow]].<ref name="Michigan Hockey Newspaper"/>

===The Heritage Classic===

The largest crowd to ever watch an NHL game was during the [[Heritage Classic]] when 57,167 people watched the [[Edmonton Oilers]] battle the [[Montreal Canadiens]].  The game was held at [[Commonwealth Stadium]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], on November 22, [[2003]]. Montreal edged Edmonton 4-3. One of the most memorable things about this game was Canadiens' goaltender [[José Théodore]]'s [[tuque|toque]] which he wore outside of his mask.

An old-timers game (referred to as the MegaStars game) was played prior to the NHL game and featured an alumni of Oilers playing against a squad of former Canadiens.  This is the only alumni game in which [[Wayne Gretzky]] has played since retiring, and he maintains it will also be the last.
