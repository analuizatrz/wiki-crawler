[[Christian views of Jesus]] (see also [[Christology]]) center on the belief that Jesus is the Messiah whose coming was [[Messianic prophecy in Christianity|promised in the Old Testament]] and that he was [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] after his crucifixion. Christians predominantly believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], who came to provide [[Salvation#Christian views of salvation|salvation]] and reconciliation with [[God]]. [[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian]] Christians profess various other interpretations regarding his divinity (see [[Jesus#Religious perspectives|below]]). Other Christian beliefs include Jesus' [[Virgin Birth]], performance of [[miracles of Jesus|miracles]], fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|biblical prophecy]], [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]] into [[Heaven]], and future [[Second Coming]].

In [[Islam]], Jesus ({{lang-ar|عيسى}}, commonly transliterated as '''''[[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]]''''') is considered one of [[Islamic concept of God|God's]] most beloved and important [[prophets of Islam|prophets]], a bringer of divine scripture, a worker of miracles, and the Messiah. [[Muslim]]s, however, do not share the Christian belief in the crucifixion or [[divinity of Jesus]]. Muslims believe that Jesus' crucifixion was a divine illusion and that he [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|ascended bodily to heaven]]. Most Muslims also believe that he will [[Islamic eschatology|return to the earth]] in the company of the [[Mahdi]] once the earth has become full of sin and injustice at the time of the arrival of Islam's [[Antichrist]]-like [[Dajjal]].

== Chronology ==
{{main|Chronology of Jesus}}

The most detailed accounts of Jesus' birth are contained in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (probably written between 65 and 90 AD/CE),<ref name="mat-date">[[Darrell L. Bock]], ''Jesus According to Scripture'', pp. 29–30, gives a ''c.'' 60–70 date; L. Michael White, ''From Jesus to Christianity'', p. 244, gives ''c.'' 80–90.</ref> and the [[Gospel of Luke]] (probably written between 65 and 100 AD/CE).<ref name="luke-date">Bock, ''ibid.'', p. 38, gives ''c.'' 62–70; White, ''ibid.'', p. 252, gives ''c.'' 90–100.</ref> Scholars debate over the details of Jesus' birth, and few claim to know the exact year or date of his birth or death.

The nativity accounts in the [[New Testament]] gospels of Matthew and Luke do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus. In [[Western Christianity]], it has been traditionally celebrated on December 25 as [[Christmas]] (in the [[Liturgical year|liturgical]] season of [[Christmastide]]), a date that can be traced as early as 330 among Roman Christians. Before then, Jesus' birth was generally celebrated on [[January 6]] as part of the feast of [[Theophany]],<ref> Erwin Fahlbusch and Geoffrey William Bromiley, ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity.'' Grand Rapids, Mich.; Leiden, Netherlands: Wm. B. Eerdmans; Brill, 1999–2003, 1:454–55</ref> also known as [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]], which commemorated not only Jesus' birth but also his [[baptism]] by [[John the Baptist|John]] in the [[Jordan River]] and possibly additional events in Jesus' life. (Many today in [[Eastern Christianity]] celebrate Christmas on January 7 because they continue to use the Julian calendar, in which December 25 corresponds to January 7 on the Gregorian calendar now in common usage.) Some scholars note that Luke's descriptions of shepherds' activities at the time of Jesus' birth suggest a spring or summer date.<ref> Porterm J. R. ''Jesus Christ: The Jesus of History, the Christ of Faith.'' Oxford University Press, 1999. Pg. 70 ISBN 0–19–521429–3</ref> Scholars speculate that the date of the celebration was moved by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in an attempt to replace the Roman festival of [[Saturnalia]] (or more specifically, the birthday of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god [[Sol Invictus]]).

In the 247th year during the [[Diocletian]] [[Calendar era|Era]] (based on Diocletian's ascension to the Roman throne), [[Dionysius Exiguus]] attempted to pinpoint the number of years since Jesus' birth, arriving at a figure of 753 years after the [[founding of Rome]]. Dionysius then set Jesus' birth as being [[December 25]] [[1 BC|1 ACN]] (for "Ante Christum Natum," or "before Christ (was) born"), and assigned AD 1 to the following year — thereby establishing the system of numbering years from the birth of Jesus: ''[[Anno Domini]]'' (which translates as "in the year of [[Lord]]"). The system was created in the then current year 532, and almost two centuries later it won acceptance and became the established [[calendar]] in Western civilization.

It is hard to date Jesus' birth because some sources are now gone and over 1900 years have passed since the [[Gospels]] were written; however, based on a [[lunar eclipse]] that the first-century historian [[Josephus]] reported shortly before the death of [[Herod the Great]] (who plays a role in Matthew's account), as well as a more accurate understanding of the succession of Roman Emperors, Jesus' birth would have been before the year 3 BC/BCE.

The Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew both place Jesus' birth under the reign of [[Herod the Great]]. Luke describes Jesus' birth as occurring during the Roman governorship of [[Quirinius]], and involving the [[Census of Quirinius|first census]] of the Roman provinces of [[History of Syria#Syria in antiquity|Syria]] and [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]]. Josephus places the governorship of Quirinius, and a census, in 6 AD/CE (which Luke refers to in {{niv|Acts|5:37|Acts 5:37}}), long after the death of Herod the Great in 4 BC/BCE. Hence, debate has centered over whether or not the sources can be reconciled by asserting a prior governorship of Quirinius in Syria, or if an earlier census was conducted and, if not, which source to consider in error.<ref>Josephus, Antiquities 17.342–4</ref>

The date of Jesus' death is also unclear. The [[Gospel of John]] depicts the crucifixion as directly before the [[Passover]] festival on Friday 14 [[Nisan]] (called the [[Quartodecimanism|Quartodeciman]]), whereas the [[synoptic gospels]] (except for {{niv|Mark|14:2|Mark 14:2}}) describe Jesus' [[Last Supper]] as the Passover meal on Friday 15 Nisan; however, some scholars hold that the synoptic account is harmonious with the account in John.<ref name="alternate-supper">See [[Leon Morris]], ''The Gospel According to John, Revised'', pp. 284–295, for a discussion of several alternate theories with references.</ref> Further, the Jews followed a [[lunisolar calendar]] with phases of the moon as dates, complicating calculations of any exact date in a solar calendar. According to [[John P. Meier]]'s ''A Marginal Jew'', which takes into consideration the [[procurator]]ship of [[Pontius Pilate]] and the dates of the Passover in those years, Jesus' death was probably on [[April 7]], [[30]] AD/CE or [[April 3]], [[33]] AD/CE.<ref>Meier, p.1:402</ref>

{{Gospel Jesus}}

== Life and teachings, as told in the Gospels ==
{{main|New Testament view on Jesus' life}}

The [[Bible]]'s four [[biblical canon|canonical]] [[gospel]]s are the main sources for the traditional [[Christian]] biography of Jesus' life.
Christian scholars generally believe the gospel accounts to be [[historical method|historically accurate]]; critical scholars, on the other hand, debate the extent of their historicity.

=== Genealogy and family ===
{{main|Genealogy of Jesus|Desposyni}}

[[Image:Czestochowska.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Jesus and Mary: [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]]]]

Of the four gospels, only Matthew and Luke give accounts of Jesus' genealogy. The accounts in the two gospels are substantially different, and various theories have been proposed to explain the discrepancies.<ref>Joseph A. Fitzmyer, The Gospel According to Luke I-IX. Anchor Bible. Garden City: Doubleday, 1981, pp. 499–500; I. Howard Marshall, The Gospel of Luke (The New International Greek Testament Commentary). Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1978, p. 158;</ref> Both accounts, however, trace his line back to [[David|King David]] and from there to [[Abraham]]. These lists are identical between Abraham and David, but they differ between David and Joseph. Matthew starts with [[Solomon]] and proceeds through the kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] to the last king, [[Jeconiah]]. After Jeconiah, the line of kings terminated when [[Babylonian captivity|Babylon conquered Judah]]. Thus, Matthew shows that Jesus is the legal heir to the throne of [[Land of Israel|Israel]]. Luke's genealogy is longer than Matthew's; it goes back to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] and provides more names between David and Jesus.

Joseph, husband of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and Jesus' father, appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood. John's account of Jesus commending Mary into the care of the [[beloved disciple]] during his crucifixion ({{niv|John|19:25–27|John 19:25–27}}) suggests that Joseph had died by the time of Jesus' ministry.<ref> Easton, Matthew Gallego, [http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/joseph-fosterfatherofjesus.html "Joseph (the foster father of Jesus Christ)"], Christiananswers.net Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]]</ref> The New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, and Galatians tell of Jesus' relatives, including what may have been brothers and sisters.<ref>{{niv|Matthew|13:55–56|Matthew 13:55–56}}, {{niv|Mark|6:3|Mark 6:3}}, and {{niv|Galatians|1:19|Galatians 1:19}}</ref> The Greek word ''adelphos'' in these verses, often translated as ''brother'', can refer to any familial relation, and most Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians translate the word as ''kinsman'' or ''cousin'' in this context (see [[Perpetual virginity of Mary]]). Luke also mentions that [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], mother of John the Baptist, was a "cousin" or "relative" of Mary ({{niv|Luke|1:36|Luke 1:36}}), which would make John a distant cousin of Jesus.

=== Nativity and early life ===
{{main|Annunciation|Nativity of Jesus|Child Jesus}}

[[Image:Gerard van Honthorst 002.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''Adoration of the Shepherds'', [[Gerard van Honthorst]], 17th century]]

According to Matthew and Luke, Jesus was born in [[Bethlehem]] of [[Judea]] to Mary, a virgin, by a miracle of the [[Holy Spirit]]. The Gospel of Luke gives an account of the [[angel]] [[Gabriel]] visiting Mary to tell her that she was chosen to bear the [[Son of God]] ({{niv|Luke|1:26–38|Luke 1:26–38}}). According to Luke, an order of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] had forced Mary and Joseph to leave their homes in [[Nazareth]] and come to the home of Joseph's ancestors, the house of [[David]], for the [[Census of Quirinius]].

After Jesus' birth, the couple was forced to use a [[manger]] in place of a crib because there was no room for them in the town's inn ({{niv|Luke|2:1–7|Luke 2:1–7}}). According to Luke, an angel announced Jesus' birth to shepherds who came to see the newborn child and who subsequently publicized what they had witnessed throughout the area (see [[The First Noël]]). Matthew tells of the "[[Biblical Magi|Wise Men]]" or "[[Magi]]" who brought gifts to the infant Jesus after following a star which they believed was a sign that the [[King of the Jews]] had been born ({{niv|Matthew|2:1–12|Matthew 2:1–12}}).

Jesus' childhood home is identified as the town of [[Nazareth]] in [[Galilee]]. Except for a [[Flight into Egypt|journey to Egypt]] by his family in his infancy to escape Herod's [[Massacre of the Innocents]] and a short trip to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] (in what is now Lebanon), the Gospels place all other events in Jesus' life in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]].<ref>''For Egypt'': {{niv|Matthew|2:13–23|Matthew 2:13–23}}; ''For Tyre and sometimes Sidon'':{{niv|Matthew|15:21–28|Matthew 15:21–28}} and {{niv|Mark|7:24–30|Mark 7:24–3}}</ref> According to Matthew, the family remained in Egypt until Herod's death, whereupon they returned to Nazareth to avoid living under the authority of Herod's son and successor [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]] ({{niv|Matthew|2:19–23|Matthew 2:19–23}}).

Only Luke tells that Jesus was found teaching in the temple by his parents after being lost. The [[Finding in the Temple]] ({{niv|Luke|2:41–52|Luke 2:41–52}}) is the only event between Jesus' infancy and baptism mentioned in any of the canonical Gospels. According to Luke, Jesus was "about thirty years of age" when he was baptized ({{niv|Luke|3:23|Luke 3:23}}). In Mark, Jesus is called a carpenter. Matthew says he was a carpenter's son, suggesting to some that Jesus may have spent some of his first 30 years practicing carpentry with his father ({{niv|Mark|6:3|Mark 6:3}}, {{niv|Matthew|13:55|Matthew 13:55}}).

=== Baptism and Temptation ===
{{main|Baptism of Jesus|Temptation of Jesus|John the Baptist}}

[[Image:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|right|175px|''Temptation of Christ'', [[Ary Scheffer]], 19th c.]]

All three synoptic Gospels describe the [[Baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]], an event which Biblical scholars describe as the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. According to these accounts, Jesus came to the [[Jordan River]] where John the Baptist had been preaching and baptizing people in the crowd. Matthew describes John as initially hesitant to comply with Jesus' request for John to baptize him, stating that it was Jesus who should baptize him. Jesus persisted, "It is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness" ({{niv|Matthew|3:15|Matthew 3:15}}). After Jesus was baptized and rose from the water, Mark states Jesus "saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending upon Him like a dove. Then a voice came from heaven saying: 'You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'" ({{nkjv|Mark|1:10–11|Mark 1:10–11}}). The Gospel of John doesn't include the baptism but does attest that Jesus is the very one about whom John the Baptist had been preaching — the Son of God.

Following his baptism,Jesus was led into the desert by God where he [[fasting|fasted]] for forty days and forty nights ({{niv|Matthew|4:1–2|Matthew 4:1–2}}). During this time, the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] appeared to him and tempted Jesus three times. Each time, Jesus refused temptation with a quotation of [[scripture]] from the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]. The devil departed and angels came and brought nourishment to Jesus ({{niv|Matthew|4:1–11|Matthew 4:1–11}}, {{niv|Mark|1:12–13|Mark 1:12–13}}, {{niv|Luke|4:1–13|Luke 4:1–13}}).

=== Ministry ===
{{main|Ministry of Jesus|Sermon on the Mount|Sermon on the Plain|Twelve Apostles|Transfiguration of Jesus}}

[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''Sermon on the Mount'', [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], 19th c.]]

The Gospels state that Jesus, as Messiah, came to "give his life as a ransom for many" and "preach the good news of the [[Kingdom of God]]."<ref>{{niv|Mark|10:45|Mark 10:45}}, {{niv|Luke|4:43|Luke 4:43}}, {{niv|John|20:31|John 20:31}}.</ref> Over the course of his ministry, Jesus is said to have [[Miracles of Jesus|performed various miracles]], including healings, [[exorcism]]s, [[walking on water]], [[turning water into wine]], and raising several people, such as [[Lazarus]], from the dead ({{niv|John|11:1–44|John 11:1–44}}, {{niv|Matthew|9:25|Matthew 9:25}}, and {{niv|Luke|7:15|Luke 7:15}}).

[[Image:First century palestine.gif|thumb|200px|right|Judæa and Galilee at the time of Jesus]]

The Gospel of John describes three different [[passover]] feasts over the course of Jesus' ministry. This implies that Jesus preached for a period of three years, although some interpretations of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] suggest a span of only one year.<ref>"The Thompson Chain-Reference Study Bible NIV," published December 1999, B.B. Kirkbride Bible Co., Inc.; William Adler & Paul Tuffin, "The Chronography of George Synkellos: A Byzantine Chronicle of Universal History from the Creation," Oxford University Press (2002), p. 466</ref>
The focus of his ministry was toward his closest adherents, the [[Twelve Apostles]], though many of his followers were considered [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]. The Twelve Apostles and others closest to Jesus were all Jews as shown by Jesus’ statement that his mission is directed only to those of the house of Israel ({{niv|Matthew|15:24|Matthew 15:24}}) and by the fact that only after the death of Jesus did the apostles agree with Paul that the teaching of the gospel could be extended to uncircumcised Gentiles ({{niv|Acts|15:1–31|Acts 15:1–31}}, {{niv|Galatians|2:7–9|Galatians 2:7-9}}). Jesus led an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] following. He preached that the [[End times|end of the current world]] would come unexpectedly, and that he would return to judge the world, especially according to [[The Sheep and the Goats|how they treated the vulnerable]]; for this reason, he called on his followers to be ever alert and faithful. Jesus also taught that repentance was necessary to escape hell, and promised to give those who believe in him eternal life ({{niv|John|3:16–18|John 3:16–18}}).

At the height of his ministry, Jesus attracted huge crowds numbering in the thousands, primarily in the areas of [[Galilee]] and Perea (in modern-day [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]] respectively).<ref>In ''John'', Jesus' ministry takes place in and around Jerusalem.</ref> Some of Jesus' most famous teachings come from the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which contained the [[Beatitudes]] and the [[Lord's Prayer]]. Jesus often employed [[Parables of Jesus|parables]], such as the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. His teachings encouraged unconditional self-sacrificing [[agape|God-like love]] for God and for all people. During his sermons, he preached about service and humility, the forgiveness of sin, faith, [[Turn the other cheek|turning the other cheek]], [[Expounding of the Law#Love|love for one's enemies]] as well as friends, and the need to follow the spirit of [[Torah|the law]] in addition to the letter.<ref>''Sermon on the Mount'': {{niv|Matthew|5–7|Matthew 5–7}}; ''Prodigal Son'': {{niv|Luke|15:11–32|Luke 15:11–32}}; ''Parable of the Sower'': {{niv|Matthew|13:1–9|Matthew 13:1–9}}; ''Agape'': {{niv|Matthew|22:34–40|Matthew 22:34–40}}.</ref>

Jesus often met with society's outcasts, such as the [[publicani]] (Imperial tax collectors who were despised for extorting money), including the apostle [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]; when the [[Pharisees]] objected to Jesus' meeting with sinners rather than the righteous, Jesus replied that it was the sick who need a physician, not the healthy ({{niv|Matthew|9:9–13|Matthew 9:9–13}}). According to Luke and John, Jesus also made efforts to extend his ministry to the [[Samaritans]], who followed [[Samaritanism|a different form]] of the Israelite religion. This is reflected in his preaching to the Samaritans of [[Sychar]], resulting in their conversion ({{niv|John|4:1–42|John 4:1–42}}).

According to the synoptic gospels, Jesus led three of [[Twelve Apostles|his apostles]] — [[Simon Peter|Peter]], [[John the Apostle|John]], and [[James the Great|James]] — to the top of a mountain to pray. While there, he was [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]] before them, his face shining like the sun and his clothes brilliant white; [[Elijah]] and [[Moses]] appeared adjacent to him. A bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the sky said, "This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased."<ref>{{niv|Matthew|17:1–6|Matthew 17:1–6}}, {{niv|Mark|9:1–8|Mark 9:1–8}}, {{niv|Luke|9:28–36|Luke 9:28–36}}</ref> The gospels also state that toward the end of his ministry, Jesus began to warn his disciples of his future death and resurrection ({{niv|Matthew|16:21–28|Matthew 16:21–28}}).

=== Arrest, trial, and death ===

In the account given by the synoptic gospels, Jesus came with his followers to Jerusalem during the Passover festival where a large crowd came to meet him, shouting, "[[Hosanna]]! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the King of Israel!"<ref>The crowd was quoting {{niv|Psalms|118:26|Psalms 118:26}}; found in {{niv|John|12:13–16|John 12:13–16}}.</ref> Following his [[triumphal entry]],<ref>John puts the cleansing of the temple at the start of Jesus' ministry.</ref> Jesus created a disturbance at [[Herod's Temple]] by [[Jesus and the Money Changers|overturning the tables of the moneychangers]] who set up shop there, and claiming that they had made the Temple a "den of robbers." ({{niv|Mark|11:17|Mark 11:17}}). Later that week, Jesus celebrated the [[Passover|Passover meal]] with his disciples — an event subsequently known as the [[Last Supper]] — in which he prophesied that he would be betrayed by one of his disciples, and would then be executed. In this ritual he took bread and wine in hand, saying: "this is my body which is given for you" and "this cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my blood," and instructed them to "do this in [[Anamnesis|remembrance]] of me" ({{niv|Luke|22:7–20|Luke 22:7–20}}). Following the supper, Jesus and his disciples went to pray in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]].

While in the Garden, Jesus was [[Arrest of Jesus|arrested]] by temple guards on the orders of the [[Sanhedrin]] and the high priest, [[Caiaphas]] ({{niv|Luke|22:47–52|Luke 22:47–52}}, {{niv|Matthew|26:47–56|Matthew 26:47–56}}). The arrest took place clandestinely at night to avoid a riot, as Jesus was popular with the people at large ({{niv|Mark|14:2|Mark 14:2}}). [[Judas Iscariot]], one of his apostles, betrayed Jesus by identifying him to the guards with [[The Kiss of Judas|a kiss]]. Simon Peter, another one of Jesus' apostles, used a sword to attack one of Jesus' captors, cutting off his ear, which, according to Luke, Jesus immediately healed miraculously.<ref>The apostle is identified as [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]] in {{niv|john|18:10|John 18:10}}; the healing of the ear is found in {{niv|luke|22:51|Luke 22:51}}.</ref> Jesus rebuked the apostle, stating "all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword" ({{niv|Matthew|26:52|Matthew 26:52}}). After his arrest, Jesus' apostles went into hiding.

[[Image:Cristo Velázquez lou2.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''[[Crucifixion]]'', [[Diego Velázquez]], 17th c.]]

During the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus]], the high priests and elders asked Jesus, "Are you the [[Son of God]]?," and after he replied, "You say that I am," they condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]] ({{niv|luke|22:70–71|Luke 22:70–71}}). The high priests then turned him over to the Roman [[procurator]] [[Pontius Pilate]], based on an accusation of [[sedition]] for claiming to be King of the Jews.<ref>{{niv|Matthew|27:11|Matthew 27:11}}; {{niv|Mark|15:2|Mark 15:12}}.</ref> When Jesus came before Pilate, Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" to which he replied, "It is as you say." According to the Gospels, Pilate personally felt that Jesus was not guilty of any crime against the Romans, and since there was a custom at Passover for the Roman governor to free a prisoner (a custom not recorded outside the Gospels), Pilate offered the crowd a choice between Jesus of Nazareth and an insurrectionist named [[Barabbas]]. The crowd chose to have Barabbas freed and Jesus crucified. Pilate washed his hands to indicate that he was innocent of the injustice of the decision ({{niv|Matthew|27:11–26|Matthew 27:11–26}}).

According to all four Gospels, Jesus died before late afternoon at [[Calvary]], which was also called Golgotha. The wealthy Judean [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the [[Sanhedrin]] according to Mark and Luke, received Pilate's permission to take possession of Jesus' body, placing it in a tomb.<ref>{{niv|Mark|15:42–46|Mark 15:42–46}}; {{niv|Luke|23:50–56|Luke 23:50–56}}.</ref> According to John, Joseph was aided by [[Nicodemus]], who joined him to help bury Jesus, and who appears in other parts of John's gospel ({{niv|John|19:38–42|John 19:38–42}}). The three Synoptic Gospels tell of the darkening of the sky from twelve until three that afternoon; Matthew also mentions an [[earthquake]] ({{niv|Matthew|27:51|Matthew 27:51}}).

[[Image:Grunewald - christ.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''Christ en majesté'', [[Matthias Grünewald]], 16th c.: [[Resurrection of Jesus]]]]

According to the Gospels, Jesus [[resurrection of Jesus|rose from the dead]] on the third day after his [[crucifixion]].<ref name="Resurrection">{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew |chapter=28|verse=5|range=-10}}; {{niv|mark|16:9|Mark 16:9}}; {{niv|luke|24:12–16|Luke 24:12–16}}; {{niv|John|20:10–17|John 20:10–17}}; {{niv|Acts|2:24|Acts 2:24}}; {{niv|1Cor|6:14|1Cor 6:14}}</ref> The Gospel of Matthew states that an angel appeared near the tomb of Jesus and announced his resurrection to [[Mary Magdelene]] and "another Mary" who had arrived to [[anoint]] the body ({{niv|Matthew|28:1–10|Matthew 28:1–10}}). According to Luke there were two angels ({{niv|Luke|24:4|Luke 24:4}}), and according to Mark there was a youth dressed in white ({{niv|Mark|16:5|Mark 16:5}}). The "[[Mark 16|longer ending]]" to Mark states that on the morning of his resurrection, Jesus first appeared to [[Mary Magdalene]] ({{niv|Mark|16:9|Mark 16:9}}). John states that when Mary looked into the tomb, two angels asked her why she was crying; and as she turned round she initially failed to recognize Jesus until he spoke her name ({{niv|john|20:11–18|John 20:11–18}}).

The [[Acts of the Apostles]] state that Jesus appeared to various people in various places over the next forty days. Hours after his resurrection, he appeared to two travelers on the road to [[Emmaus]] ({{niv|Luke|24:13–35|Luke 24:13–35}}). To his assembled disciples he showed himself on the evening after his resurrection ({{niv|John|20:19|John 20:19}}). Although his own ministry had been specifically to Jews, Jesus is said to have sent his apostles to the Gentiles with the [[Great Commission]] and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascended]] to heaven while a cloud concealed him from their sight. According to Acts, [[Paul of Tarsus]] had a vision of Jesus during his [[Road to Damascus]] experience. Jesus promised to [[Second Coming|come again]] to fulfill the remainder of [[Messianic prophecy]].<ref>''Ministering to Israel'': {{niv|Matthew|15:24|Matthew 15:24}}; ''ascension'': {{niv|Mark|16:19|Mark 16:19}}; {{niv|Luke|24:51|Luke 24:51}}{{niv|Acts|1:6–11|Acts 1:6–11.}}; ''Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus'': {{niv|Acts|9:1–19|Acts 9:1–19.}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|22:1–22|31}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|26:9–24|31}}; ''Second coming'': {{niv|Matthew|24:36–44|Matthew 24:36–44}}</ref>

=== Fulfillment of prophecy ===
{{main|Messianic prophecy in Christianity}}

The Gospels present Jesus' birth, life, death, and resurrection as fulfillments of prophecies found in the Hebrew Bible. See, for example, the [[virgin birth]], the [[flight into Egypt]], Immanuel ([[Isaiah 7:14]]), and the [[suffering servant]].

== Historicity ==
{{main|Historicity of Jesus}}

Scholars have used the [[historical method]] to develop probable reconstructions of Jesus' life. Some scholars draw a distinction between Jesus as reconstructed through historical methods and Jesus as understood through a theological point of view, while other scholars hold that a [[Religious perspectives on Jesus|theological Jesus]] represents a historical figure.<ref>See, for an example of the latter, Pope [[Benedict XVI]], ''Jesus of Nazareth''. Doubleday, 2007. ISBN 978-0-385-52341-7</ref> The main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Biblical scholars and classical historians generally accept the historical existence of Jesus, with claims against existence regarded as "effectively refuted".<ref>"The nonhistoricity thesis has always been controversial, and it has consistently failed to convince scholars of many disciplines and religious creeds. ... Biblical scholars and classical historians now regard it as effectively refuted." - Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2000), p. 16.</ref>

=== Reconstructing a historical Jesus ===
{{main|Historical Jesus|Cultural and historical background of Jesus}}

Secular historians generally describe Jesus as an itinerant preacher and leader of a religious movement within Judaism.<ref>Harrison, John B. and Richard E. Sullivan. A short history of Western civilization. New York: Knopf. 1975.</ref> According to historical reconstruction, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, taught in parables and aphorisms, challenged pious traditions, legalism and social hierarchy, and was crucified by the Romans. Historians are divided over whether Jesus led a career of healing and exorcism, preached the end of the world was imminent, and saw his crucifixion as inevitable.

Most scholars agree the Gospel of Mark was written about the time of the destruction of [[Herod's Temple|the Jewish Temple]] by the Romans under [[Titus]] in the year 70, and that the other gospels written between 70–100.<ref>Meier (1991), pp.43–4</ref> The historical outlook on Jesus relies on [[Biblical criticism|criticism of the Bible]], especially the gospels. Many scholars have sought to reconstruct Jesus' life in terms of contemporaneous political, cultural, and religious currents in Israel, including differences between Galilee and Judea, and between different sects such the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Essenes]] and [[Zealots]].<ref>For a comparison of the Jesus movement to the Zealots, see [[S. G. F. Brandon]], ''Jesus and the Zealots: a study of the political factor in primitive Christianity,'' Manchester University Press (1967) ISBN 0–684–31010–4</ref><ref name="comparison">For a general comparison of Jesus' teachings to other schools of first century Judaism, see [[John P.

==== Ties to religious groups ====

The Gospels record that Jesus was a [[Nazarene]], a term commonly taken to refer to his place of birth, but sometimes as a religious affiliation.<ref name="comparison">.</ref> Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a [[Pharisee]].<ref>Based on a comparison of the Gospels with the [[Talmud]] and other Jewish literature. <!-- Sanders is disputed, see talk[[E.

ISBN 0–7735–2046–5. Rabbi Neusner contends that Jesus' teachings were closer to the House of Shammai than the House of Hillel.</ref> Jesus also commented on the House of Hillel's teachings ([[Babylonian Talmud]], [[Shabbat]] 31a) concerning the [[Shema Yisrael|greatest commandment]] ({{niv|Mark|12:28–34|Mark 12:28–34}}) and the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] ({{niv|Matthew|7:12|Matthew 7:12}}).

Other scholars theorize that Jesus was an [[Essene]], a sect of Judaism not mentioned in the [[New Testament]].<ref>Based on a comparison of the Gospels with the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], especially the [[Teacher of Righteousness]] and Pierced Messiah.

==== Names and titles ====
{{main|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}

According to most historians, Jesus probably lived in [[Galilee]] for most of his life and he probably spoke [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}} The name "Jesus" is an [[English language|English]] transliteration of the [[Latin language|Latin]] (''Iēsus'') which in turn comes from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] name Iesous (''{{Polytonic|Ιησους}}''). The name has also been translated into English as "Joshua."<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374x.htm "Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ"]. ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]].''</ref> Since most scholars hold that Jesus was an Aramaic-speaking Jew living in Galilee around 30 AD/CE, it is highly improbable that he had a Greek personal name. Further examination of the [[Septuagint]] finds that the Greek, in turn, is a transliteration of the Hebrew/[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]] ({{lang|he|ישוע}}) (''Yeshua'' — he will save) a contraction of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name ''Yehoshua'' ({{lang|he|יהושוע}} ''Yeho'' — [[Yahweh]] [is] ''shua`'' — help/salvation, usually Romanized as ''Joshua''). As a result, scholars believe that one of these was most likely the name that Jesus was known by during his lifetime by his peers.<ref>Durant, Will. ''Caesar and Christ''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1944. p. 558; John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew''. New York: Doubleday, 1991 vol. 1:205–7;</ref>

''[[Christ]]'' (which is a title and not a part of his name) is an Anglicization of the Greek term for ''[[Messiah]]'' (''χριστός'', from the verb ''χρίω''  "to anoint"), and literally means "anointed one." Historians have debated what this title might have meant at the time Jesus lived; some historians have suggested that other titles applied to Jesus in the New Testament had meanings in the first century quite different from those meanings ascribed today.<ref>Vermes, "Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels"</ref>

The titles "Divine," "[[Son of God]]," "God," "God from God," "Lord," "Redeemer," "Liberator," and "Saviour of the World" were collectively applied to [[Octavian]], who became [[Caesar Augustus]] after defeating [[Mark Antony]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC/BCE. [[John Dominic Crossan]] cites the adoption of them by the early Christians to apply to Jesus as denying them of Caesar the Augustus. "They were taking the identity of the Roman emperor and giving it to a Jewish peasant. Either that was a peculiar joke and a very low lampoon, or it was what the Romans called ''majistas'' and we call high treason. " <ref> Crossan, John Dominic, God and Empire, 2007, p. 28</ref>

=== Sources on Jesus' life ===
{{see also|Historicity of Jesus}}

Most Biblical scholars hold that the works describing Jesus were initially communicated by [[oral history|oral tradition]], and were not committed to writing until several decades after Jesus' crucifixion. The earliest [[extant text]]s which refer to Jesus are [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] letters, which are usually dated from the mid-1st century. Paul wrote that he only saw Jesus in visions, but that they were divine [[revelation]]s and hence authoritative ({{niv|Galatians|1:11–12|Galatians 1:11–12}}). The earliest extant texts describing Jesus in any detail were the four [[Gospel]]s. These texts, being part of the [[Biblical canon]], have received much more analysis and acceptance from Christian sources than other possible sources for information on Jesus.

Many other early Christian texts detail events in Jesus' life and teachings, though they were not included when [[Biblical canon|the Bible was canonized]] due to a belief that they were [[pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphical]], not inspired, or written too long after his death, while others were suppressed because they contradicted Christian [[orthodoxy]]. It took several centuries before the list of what was and was not part of the [[Bible]] became finally fixed, and for much of the early period the [[Book of Revelation]] was not included while works like [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] were.

Books that were not included are known as the [[New Testament apocrypha]]. These include the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]'', a collection of ''[[logia]]'' — phrases and sayings attributed to Jesus without a narrative framework, only rediscovered in the 20th century. Other important apocryphal works that had a heavy influence in forming traditional Christian beliefs include the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], [[Protevangelium of James]], [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]], and [[Acts of Peter]]. A number of Christian traditions (such as [[Saint Veronica|Veronica's veil]] and the [[Assumption of Mary]]) are found not in the canonical gospels but in these and other apocryphal works.

==== Possible earlier texts ====

Some texts with even earlier historical or mythological information on Jesus are speculated to have existed prior to the Gospels,<ref>Bettenson, Henry and Maunder, Chris. ''Documents of the Christian Church'' (3rd edition), Oxford University Press, 1999. ISBN 0–19–288071–3 </ref> though none have been found. Based on the [[synoptic problem|unusual similarities and differences]] between the [[Synoptic Gospels]] — [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the first three canonical gospels — many Biblical scholars have suggested that [[oral tradition]] and [[logia]] (such as the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and the theoretical [[Q document]])<ref>Gaztambide, Daniel. [http://www.aramaicnt.org/site/index.php?mode=article&entry=30 "The Synoptic Problem: Two-Source Hypothesis and Q"], AramaicNT.org, Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]].</ref> probably played a strong role in initially passing down stories of Jesus, and may have inspired some of the Synoptic Gospels.

Specifically, many scholars believe that the Q document and the Gospel of Mark were the [[two-source hypothesis|two sources]] used for the gospels of Matthew and Luke; however, other theories, such as the older [[Augustinian hypothesis]], continue to hold sway with some Biblical scholars. Another theoretical document is the [[Signs Gospel]], believed to have been a source for the [[Gospel of John]].<ref>Gaztambide, Daniel. [http://www.aramaicnt.org/site/index.php?mode=article&entry=28 "So Sayeth The Lord... According to Who?"], AramaicNT.org, Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]].</ref>

There are also early non-canonical gospels which may predate the canonical Gospels, although few surviving fragments have been found. Among these are the [[Unknown Berlin Gospel]], the [[Oxyrhynchus Gospels]], the [[Egerton Gospel]], the [[Fayyum Fragment]], the [[Dialogue of the Saviour]], the [[Gospel of the Ebionites]], the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], and the [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]].<ref>Miller, Robert J. ''ed.'' (1994) ''The Complete Gospels: Annotated Scholars Version''. Polebridge Pres: Sonoma, CA. pp. 1–5.</ref>

==== Questions of reliability ====

As a result of perhaps a several-decade time gap between events and the writing of the Gospels where they are described, the accuracy of early texts describing the details of Jesus' life have been disputed by various parties. The authors of the Gospels are traditionally thought to have been witnesses to the events included. After the original oral stories were written down in Greek, they were transcribed, and later translated into other languages. This is not unique to the [[Bible]] — other documents of antiquity have been scrutinized for gaps between the date of an event and the date it was written. Several historians claim unreliability of the gospel accounts often as biased and second-hand, and frequently dates from several decades after the events described. This is in sharp contrast to the earliest biographies for Alexander the Great written by Arrian and Plutarch more than four hundred years after Alexander's death in 323 BC/BCE, yet historians consider them to be generally trustworthy.{{Or|date=July 2007}} For example, [[Paul Barnett (bishop)|Paul Barnett]] pointed out that "scholars of [[ancient history]] have always recognized the '[[subjectivity]]' factor in their available sources" and "have so few sources available compared to their modern counterparts that they will gladly seize whatever scraps of information that are at hand." He noted that [[modern history]] and [[ancient history]] are two separate disciplines, with differing methods of analysis and interpretation.<ref>[[Paul Barnett (bishop)|Barnett, Paul]], "Is the New Testament History?," p.1.</ref>

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Scientific Revolution]] brought skepticism regarding the historical accuracy of these texts. Although some critical scholars, including archaeologists, continue to use them as points of reference in the study of ancient Near Eastern history,<ref>Hawkins, Craig S. [http://www.apologeticsinfo.org/papers/actsarcheology.html "The Book of Acts and Archaeology"], Apologetics Information Ministry, Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]].</ref> others have come to view the texts as cultural and literary documents, generally regarding them as part of the genre of literature called [[hagiography]], an account of a holy person regarded as representing a moral and divine ideal. Hagiography has as its primary aim the glorification of the religion itself and of the example set by the perfect holy person represented as its central focus.

The views of intellectuals who entirely reject Jesus' historicity are summarized in the chapter on Jesus in [[Will Durant]]'s ''Caesar and Christ''. It is based on a reputed scarcity of eyewitness, a lack of direct archaeological evidence, the failure of certain ancient works to mention Jesus, and alleged similarities between early Christianity and contemporary mythology.<ref>Durant 1944:553–7</ref>

Those who have a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] view of history generally do not believe in divine intervention or [[miracle]]s, such as the resurrection of Jesus mentioned by the Gospels. One method used to estimate the factual accuracy of stories in the gospels is known as the "[[criterion of embarrassment]]," which holds that stories about events with embarrassing aspects (such as the denial of Jesus by [[Saint Peter|Peter]], or the fleeing of Jesus' followers after his arrest) would likely not have been included if those accounts were fictional.<ref name="A Marginal Jew"> Meier, John P., [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'']], Doubleday: 1991. vol 1: p. 168–171. </ref>

Some scholars suggest that the gospel accounts of Jesus have little or no historical basis. They see similarities between stories about Jesus and older myths of [[Paganism|pagan]] god-men such as [[Mithras]], [[Attis]] and [[Osiris-Dionysus]]. Their conjecture is that the pagan myths were adopted by some authors of early accounts of Jesus to form a [[syncretism]] with Christianity. Some popular writers such as [[Earl Doherty]] carry this even further and propose that the gospels are actually a reworking of non-Abrahamic myths and [[Jesus as myth|not based on a historical figure]].<ref name="asmyth">[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]]; [[J.M. Robertson|John Mackinnon Robertson]]; [[George Albert Wells|G.A. Wells]]. ''[[The Jesus Legend]]'', Chicago: Open Court, 1996, p xii.</ref> Some Christian authors, such as [[Justin Martyr]] and [[C.S. Lewis]], suggest that the myths were created by ancient pagans who took prophetic attributes of the Messiah as taught in the Pentateuch and Prophets applied them to their particular deity.

Still other researchers disagree with the view that the stories about Jesus were adapted from older myths. In 1962, Judaic scholar Samuel Sandmel cautioned against this practice and adapted the term "Parallelomania" to describe it. "We might for our purposes define parallelomania as that extravagance among scholars which first overdoes the supposed similarity in passages and then proceeds to describe source and derivation as if implying a literary connection flowing in an inevitable or predetermined direction."<ref>Sandmel, Samuel. "Parallelomania," ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 1 (Mar. 1962)</ref> In the book ''Reinventing Jesus'', the authors put forth the position that "Only after 100 (AD/CE) did the mysteries begin to look very much like Christianity, precisely because their existence was threatened by this new religion. They had to compete to survive."<ref>Komoszewski et al (2006), ''Reinventing Jesus'', Kregel, p.237</ref> Other scholars, such as [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]], also do not see significant similarity between the pagan myths and Christianity. Grant states in ''Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels'' that "Judaism was a milieu to which doctrines of the deaths and rebirths, of mythical gods seemed so entirely foreign that the emergence of such a fabrication from its midst is very hard to credit."<ref>[[Michael Grant (author)|Grant, Michael]], ''Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels'', Scribner, 1995 p. 199.

In the second century, the Roman official and writer, [[Pliny the Younger]] (63 - ca. 113) stated that Christians were "singing responsively a hymn to Christ as to god" (''carmenque Christo quasi deo dicere secum invicem'').<ref>Pliny the Younger: [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/Pliny/Pliny10-096-L.html C. Plinius Traino Imperatori Liber Decimus Epistula XCVI]</ref> Between 325 and 681, Christians theologically articulated and refined their view of the nature of Jesus by a series of seven [[ecumenical council]]s (see [[Christology]]). These councils described Jesus as one of the three divine [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]] or persons of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]: the Son is defined as constituting, together with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, the single [[Ousia|substance]] of the One God.<ref>''Nicene Creed''; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 1; ''Augsburg Confession'', article 1; ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 3; Council of Nicaea I (325) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, ''{{lang|la|Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum}}'' (1965) §126; Council of Constantinople II (553) in ibid. §424 and 424; Council of Ephesus in ibid. §255; {{niv|John|1:1|John 1:1}}; {{niv|John|8:58|8:58}}; {{niv|John|10:30|10:30}}</ref> Furthermore, Jesus is defined to be one person with a fully human and a fully divine [[Physis|nature]], a doctrine known as the [[Hypostatic union]]<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §464–469; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 2 and 3 ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 9; Council of Ephesus (431) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, ''{{lang|la|Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum}}'' (1965) §250; Council of Ephesus in ibid. §251; Council of Chalcedon (451) in ibid. §301 and 302; {{niv|Hebrews|4:15|Hebrews 4:15}}</ref> (an articulation not accepted by [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], see [[Nestorianism]], [[Monophysitism]] and [[Miaphysitism]]). 

According to the New Testament, Jesus accepted worship ({{bibleref2|Matthew|14:33|NIV}}; {{bibleref2|Matthew|28:9|NIV}}), was accused of arrogating God's authority by telling people that their sins were forgiven ({{bibleref2|Luke|5:20-21|NIV}}), and made claims about himself including that:
*he is ("[[I am that I am|I am]]") before [[Abraham]] was ({{niv|John|8:58|John 8:58}})
*he and the Father are one ({{niv|John|10:30|John 10:30}})
*belief in him gives eternal life ({{niv|John|3:16|John 3:16}}) 
*he has "all authority in heaven and on earth" ({{bibleref2|Matthew|28:18|NIV}})
*he is present "where two or three come together" in his name ({{bibleref2|Matthew|18:20|NIV}})
*he sends the [[Paraclete]] ({{bibleref2|John|14:25-26|NIV}})
*he is the only way to God the Father ({{bibleref2|John|14:6|NIV}})

In his book ''Jesus of Nazareth'', [[Benedict XVI]] referred to Rabbi [[Jacob Neusner]], a believing Jew, who concluded from his analysis of the Gospel texts that Jesus claimed to be God by asserting himself to be a higher authority than the Jewish Law which was given to the Jews by God through Moses.<ref> [[Benedict XVI]] (2007): Jesus of Nazareth .

''Time Magazine''.</ref>  In defense of Jesus' divinity, some apologists argue that there is a [[Lewis's trilemma|trilemma]], or three possibilities, resulting from what they believe are Jesus' claims that he is the one God of Israel: either he is truly God, a liar, or a lunatic — the latter two of which they reject on the basis of what they see as Jesus' trustworthiness and wisdom.<ref>e.g., [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Peter Kreeft]] (1988): [http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/christ-divinity.htm "The Divinity of Jesus Christ"] from ''Fundamentals of the Faith''.

See also, for example, Larry Hurtado, ''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'', page 5, where he describes the traditional view as 'naive and ahistorical'.</ref>

Current religious groups that do not accept the doctrine of the Trinity include the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and the [[Christadelphians]]. Non-Trinitarian groups from history included [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], and from antiquity, [[Arianism|Arians]].

===== Latter-day Saints (Mormons) =====

[[Image:Oakland Temple statue of Jesus in the visitors center.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A statue of Jesus at a Latter Day Saints [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] visitor center]]

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] theology maintains that the ''Heavenly Father'', ''Jesus Christ'', and the ''Holy Ghost'' are three separate and distinct beings, though all eternal and equally divine, who together constitute the [[Godhead]]. Though described as "one God"[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/20/28#28] each play different roles: the Holy Ghost is a spirit without a physical body, the Father and Son possess distinct and perfected bodies of flesh and bone. 

The [[Book of Mormon]] records that the resurrected Jesus visited and taught some of the inhabitants of the early Americas after he appeared to his apostles in Jerusalem.<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=11|verse=8}} </ref> Mormons also believe that an [[Great Apostasy#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|apostasy]] occurred after the death of Christ and his apostles. They believe that Christ and the Heavenly Father appeared to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]] in 1820 as part of a series of heavenly visits to restore the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They believe Jesus (not the Father) is the same as [[Jehovah]] or [[Yahweh]] of the [[Old Testament]]. ''See [[Religious perspectives on Jesus#Jesus in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Jesus in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].''

===== Jehovah's Witnesses =====

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe Jesus to be God's (or Jehovah's) son, but rather than being God himself, Jehovah's Witnesses believe he was the same divine created being as [[Archangel Michael|Michael the Archangel]], and that he became a perfect human to come down to earth.<ref>"Jesus The Ruler Whose Origin Is From Early Times," ''The Watchtower'' (15 June 1998) p. 22.</ref> They view the term "Son of God" as an indication of Jesus' importance to the creator and his status as God's "only-begotten (unique) Son,"<ref>{{niv|John|3:16|John 3:16}}</ref> the "firstborn of all creation,"<ref>{{niv|Colossians|1:15|Col 1:15}}</ref> the one "of whom, and through whom, and to whom, are all things."<ref>{{niv|romans|11:36|Rom 11:36}}</ref> Lastly, they believe that Jesus died on a single-piece torture stake, not a cross.<ref>[http://www.watchtower.org/library/jt/article_03.htm "What Do They Believe?"], Watchtower Bible and Tract Society c.f., Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]]</ref>

===== Unity =====

The [[Unity Church]] considers Jesus the master teacher as "way shower," citing Jesus' frequent calls to emulate him rather than worship him, and the ability of others to be like him, such as in John 10:34 and John 14:12.  Jesus is not worshiped as God, but regarded as someone who and achieved a complete connection with God the Father.

===== Christadelphians =====

[[Christadelphians]] believe that Jesus is literally God's son, hence the Biblical title ''son of God'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Flint | first = James | authorlink = | coauthors = Deb Flint | title = One God or a Trinity? | publisher = Printland Publishers | date = | location = Hyderabad | pages = p. 3 | url = http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_onegod.htm#3 | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-87409-61-4 }}</ref> not ''God the Son''.

===== Other alternative views =====

Others believe that the one God, who revealed himself in the Old Testament as Jehovah, came to earth, taking on the human form of Jesus Christ. They believe Jesus is Jehovah, is the Holy Spirit, and is the one Person who is God. Examples of such churches today are [[Oneness Pentecostals]] and the [[New Church]].

==== Other early views ====

Various [[early Christian]] groups and theologians held differing views of Jesus.
The [[Ebionites]], an early [[Jewish Christian]] community, believed that Jesus was the last of the [[Prophet#Prophets in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)|prophets]] and the [[Messiah]]. They believed that Jesus was the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph, and thus they rejected the Virgin Birth. The Ebionites were [[Adoptionism|adoptionists]], believing that Jesus was not divine, but became the [[son of God]] at his baptism. They rejected the [[Epistles of Paul]], believing that Jesus kept the [[Mosaic Law]] perfectly and wanted his followers to do the same. However, they felt that Jesus' crucifixion was the ultimate sacrifice, and thus [[animal sacrifice]]s were no longer necessary. Therefore, some Ebionites were [[vegetarian]] and considered both Jesus and [[John the Baptist]] to have been vegetarians.<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 102.</ref>

In [[Gnosticism]], Jesus is said to have brought the secret knowledge ([[gnosis]]) of the spiritual world necessary for salvation.<ref>McManners, John, ed., ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity,'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990, pp. 26–31.</ref> Their secret teachings were paths to gnosis, and not gnosis itself. <!-- The previous sentence is necessary to clarify that gnosis is a different concept than the teachings of Scientology. --> While some Gnostics were [[docetism|docetics]], other Gnostics believed that Jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of Christ during his baptism.<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 124–125.</ref> Many Gnostics believed that Christ was an [[Aeons#In Gnosticism|Aeon]] sent by [[Monad (Gnosticism)|a higher deity]] than the evil [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|demiurge]] who created the material world. Some Gnostics believed that Christ had a [[Syzygy#Gnosticism|syzygy]] named [[Sophia (gnosticism)|Sophia]]. The Gnostics tended to [[Gnosticism and the New Testament|interpret the books that were included in the New Testament]] as [[allegory]], and some Gnostics interpreted Jesus himself as an allegory. The Gnostics also used a number of [[Gnostic texts|other texts]] that did not become part of the New Testament canon.

[[Marcionites]] were 2nd century [[Gentile]] followers of the Christian theologian [[Marcion of Sinope]]. They believed that Jesus rejected the [[Tanakh|Jewish Scriptures]], or at least the parts that were incompatible with his teachings.<ref>[[Henry Wace|Wace, Henry]], [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/info/marcion-wace.html "Commentary on Marcion"], Retrieved [[April 16]], [[2007]]</ref> Seeing a stark contrast between the vengeful God of the [[Old Testament]] and the loving God of Jesus, Marcion came to the conclusion that the Jewish God and Jesus were two separate deities. Like some Gnostics, Marcionites saw the Jewish God as the evil creator of the world, and Jesus as the savior from the material world. They also believed Jesus was not human, but instead a completely divine spiritual being whose material body, and thus his crucifixion and death, were [[docetism|divine illusions]]. Marcion was the first known early Christian to have created a [[Biblical canon|canon]], which consisted of ten [[Pauline epistles]], and [[Gospel of Marcion|a version]] of the [[Gospel of Luke]] (possibly without the first two chapters that are in modern versions, and without Jewish references),<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 103, p. 104–105, p.108</ref> and his treatise on the ''Antithesis'' between the Old and New Testaments. Marcionism was declared a [[Heresy#Christianity|heresy]] by proto-orthodox Christianity.

[[Montanists]] in the [[2nd century]] and [[Sabellius]] in the [[3rd century]] taught that the Trinity represented not three persons but a single person in three "modes."

As in the Christian nativity accounts, the 7th-century [[Qur'an]] holds that Jesus was born without a biological father to the virgin Mary, by the will of God (in Arabic, [[Allah]]). He is referred to as ''Isa ibn Maryam'' (English: Jesus son of Mary), a [[matronymic]], as he had no biological father.<ref>Qur'an {{Quran-usc|3|45}}, {{Quran-usc|19|21}}, {{Quran-usc|19|35}}, {{Quran-usc|21|91}}</ref> In Muslim traditions, Jesus lived a perfect life of nonviolence, showing kindness to humans and animals (similar to the other Islamic prophets), without material possessions, and abstaining from [[sin]].<ref>III&E.

[[Muslim]]s, however, do not believe Jesus to have divine nature as God nor as the Son of God.

==== Ahmadiyya views ====

The [[Ahmadiyya]] Movement is a movement that originated in a small town in India during the 19th century and now numbers over 10 million followers worldwide. They believe Jesus survived the crucifixion and fled eastwards, migrating to [[Kashmir]], where he died a natural death at an old age, under the name [[Yuz Asaf]] Issa. They believe his grave is located in [[Srinagar]], [[India]]. This view has also been taken up by some western authors. <ref>Ahmad, M. M. [http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000094.html#8 "The Lost Tribes of Israel: The Travels of Jesus"], [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]]. This view has also been taken up by some western authors, Günter Grönbold, Jesus In Indien, München: Kösel 1985, ISBN 3466202701. Norbert Klatt, ''Lebte Jesus in Indien?'', Göttingen: Wallstein 1988.</ref> 

The Ahmadiyya Movement hold the view that the prophecy concerning Jesus' second coming was meant as a spiritual return and was fulfilled in the person of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of the movement, whom they also regard as the [[Imam Mahdi]] ([[Messiah]]).

=== Judaism's view ===
{{main|Judaism's view of Jesus}}

[[Judaism]] holds the idea of Jesus being God, or part of a Trinity, or a mediator to God, to be heresy.<ref>''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'', II:5</ref> Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.<ref>[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], [http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp "Why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus"], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; [http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ "Why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus"], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]] — ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; [http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&o=350 "Why don't Jews believe that Jesus was the messiah?"], [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]</ref>

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (an authoritative work of [[halakha|Jewish law]]) states:

: Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by [[Daniel]]. So that it was said, "And the members of the outlaws of your nation would be carried to make a (prophetic) vision stand. And they stumbled"<ref>Daniel 11.14</ref>. Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the [[prophet]]s spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments. And this one caused (nations) to destroy Israel by sword, and to scatter their remnant, and to humiliate them, and to exchange the Torah, and to make the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God. However, the thoughts of the Creator of the world — there is no force in a human to attain them because our ways are not God's ways, and our thoughts not God's thoughts. And all these things of Jesus the Nazarene, and of ([[Muhammad]]) the [[Ishmael]]ite who stood after him — there is no (purpose) but to straighten out the way for the King Messiah, and to restore all the world to serve God together. So that it is said, "Because then I will turn toward the nations (giving them) a clear lip, to call all of them in the name of God and to serve God (shoulder to shoulder as) one shoulder" <ref>Zephaniah 3.9</ref>. Look how all the world already becomes full of the things of the Messiah, and the things of the [[Torah]], and the things of the commandments! And these things spread among the far islands and among the many nations uncircumcised of heart.

[[Reform Judaism]], the modern progressive movement, states ''For us in the Jewish community anyone who claims that Jesus is their savior is no longer a Jew and is an [[apostate]].'' (Contemporary American Reform Responsa, #68).<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/10-Reform/section-15.html "Question 18.3.4: Reform's Position On...What is unacceptable practice?"], faqs.org, Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]</ref>

According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after [[420 BC|420 BC/BCE]], [[Malachi]] being the last prophet, who lived centuries before Jesus. Judaism states that Jesus did not fulfill the requirements set by the [[Torah]] to prove that he was a prophet. Even if Jesus had produced such a sign that Judaism recognized, Judaism states that no prophet or dreamer can contradict the laws already stated in the Torah, which Judaism states Jesus did.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/article.asp?AID=9977 Devarim 13:1–5]</ref><ref>[[Ephraim Buchwald|Buchwald, Ephraim]], [http://www.njop.org/html/REEH5764–2004.html "Parashat Re'eh 5764–2004: Identifying a True Prophet"], [[National Jewish Outreach Program]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; Tracey Rich, [http://www.jewfaq.org/prophet.htm "Prophets and Prophecy"], ''Judaism 101'', Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; Rabbi Pinchas Frankel, [http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/history.htm "Covenant of History: A Fools Prophecy"], [[Orthodox Union|Orthodox Union of Jewish Congregations of America]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; Laurence Edwards, [http://urj.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=2819&pge_prg_id=26382&pge_id=3453 "Torat Hayim — Living Torah: No Rest(s) for the Wicked"], [[Union for Reform Judaism|Union of American Hebrew Congregations]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]</ref>

=== Buddhist views ===
{{see|Buddhism and Christianity}}

Buddhists' views of Jesus differ, since Jesus is not mentioned in any Buddhist text. Some [[Buddhists]], including [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]]<ref>Beverley, James A., [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/june11/15.64.html Hollywood's Idol], Christianity Today, "Jesus Christ also lived previous lives," he said. "So, you see, he reached a high state, either as a Bodhisattva, or an enlightened person, through Buddhist practice or something like that," Retrieved April 20, 2007</ref> regard Jesus as a [[bodhisattva]] who dedicated his life to the welfare of human beings. Both Jesus and Buddha advocated radical alterations in the common religious practices of the day. There are occasional similarities in language, such as the use of the common metaphor of a line of blind men to refer to religious authorities with whom they disagreed <ref>[[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 13.15</ref><ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 15:14</ref>. Some believe there is a particularly close affinity between Buddhism (or Eastern spiritual thought generally) and the doctrine of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] texts such as [[The Gospel of Thomas]]<ref>[http://buddhistfaith.tripod.com/gospel/ "Gospel of Thomas:The Buddhist Jesus?"] Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]].</ref>

=== Hindu views ===

[[Hinduism|Hindu]] beliefs about Jesus vary. Many in the [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] tradition regard Jesus as a [[Satguru]]. [[Swami Vivekananda]] has praised Jesus and cited him as a source of strength and the epitome of perfection.<ref name="vivekananda">[http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_4/lectures_and_discourses/christ_the_messenger.htm Christ the Messenger]. Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]].</ref> [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] taught that Jesus was the reincarnation of [[Elisha]] and a student of [[John the Baptist]], the reincarnation of [[Elijah]].<ref>Paramahansa Yogananda, ''Autobiography of a Yogi,'' 2nd ed., Crystal Clarity Publishers, 2005. ISBN 1–56589–212–7.</ref> [[Mahatma Gandhi]] considered Jesus one of his main teachers and inspirations for [[nonviolent resistance]], saying "I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians.

[http://www.gnmagazine.org/issues/gn69/jesus.htm "The Jesus So Few Know,"] The Good News A Magazine of Understanding, Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]].</ref>

=== Bahá'í views ===

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers Jesus, along with [[Muhammad]], the [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], and [[Zoroaster]], and other messengers of the great religions of the world to be [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] (or [[prophet]]s), with both human and divine stations.<ref name="stockman">{{cite journal | title = Jesus Christ in the Baha'i Writings | first = Robert | last = Stockman | journal = Bahá'í Studies Review | volume = | issue = 1 | year = 1992 | url = http://bahai-library.com/index.php5?file=stockman_jesus_bahai_writings}}</ref> In their divine station Bahá'ís view them in essential unity with each other and with God, and in their human station they view them as distinct individuals.<ref name="stockman" /> Thus, in the Bahá'í view, Jesus incarnates God's attributes, perfectly reflecting and expressing them.<ref name="stockman" /> However, the Bahá'í view rejects the belief that the essence of God was perfectly or completely contained in Jesus or any other human body, since [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]] emphasizes the transcendence of the essence of God.<ref name="stockman" /> Jesus is believed to be the "Son of God" though not literally a biological son. The title "Son of God" in the Bahá'í view is seen as entirely spiritual and shows the close relationship between him and God.<ref name="log">Letter by [[Shoghi Effendi]] on [[November 29]], [[1937]], published in {{cite book |author = Compilations |editor = Hornby, Helen (Ed.) |year = 1983 |title = Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India |id = ISBN 8185091463 |url = http://bahai-library.com/?file=hornby_lights_guidance | page = p. 491}}</ref>

Bahá'ís accept Jesus as the Messiah foretold in the Jewish Scriptures. They believe though that their messenger, [[Baha'u'llah]] is the symbolic return of Christ expected during the last days.<ref name="progressive_revelation">{{cite book | title = Bahá'í Apocalypticism: The Concept of Progressive Revelation | first = Zaid | last = Lundberg | chapter = VII.

=== Mandaean views ===

[[Mandaeanism]] regards Jesus as a deceiving prophet (mšiha kdaba) of the false Jewish god of the Old Testament, [[Names of God in Judaism|Adonai]],<ref>[http://www.gnosis.org/library/haran.htm Mandaean Scriptures and Fragments: ''The Haran Gawaitha''] Retrieved April 20, 2007</ref> and an opponent of the good prophet [[John the Baptist]], who is considered a great teacher in Mandaeanism.

=== Other views ===

The [[New Age]] movement entertains a wide variety of views on Jesus. Some New Age practitioners (such as the creators of [[A Course In Miracles]]) claim to go so far as to trance-[[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] his spirit. However, the New Age movement generally teaches that Christhood is something that all may attain. [[Theosophy|Theosophists]], from whom many New Age teachings originated (a Theosophist named [[Alice A. Bailey]] invented the term ''New Age''), refer to Jesus of Nazareth as the [[Master Jesus]] and believe he had previous [[reincarnation|incarnations]] and is presently one of the [[Ascended masters|Cosmic Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] ([[deity|deities]] responsible for governing the [[planet]] [[Earth]]).

Many writers emphasize Jesus' moral teachings. [[Garry Wills]] argues that Jesus' ethics are distinct from those usually taught by Christianity.<ref> Wills, Garry, ''What Jesus Meant'' (2006) ISBN 0–670–03496–7</ref> The [[Jesus Seminar]] portrays Jesus as an itinerant preacher who taught peace and love, rights for women and respect for children, and who spoke out against the hypocrisy of religious leaders and the rich.<ref>[[John Dominic Crossan|Crossan, John Dominic]], ''The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant'', HarperSanFrancisco (1993), ISBN 0–06–061629–6; [[Robert Funk]], ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? The Search for the AUTHENTIC Words of Jesus'', Harper San Francisco (1997), ISBN 0–06–063040-X; [[Robert Funk]], ''The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?'', The Jesus Seminar, Harper San Francisco (1998), ISBN 0–06–062978–9; The [[Jesus Seminar]], ''The Gospel of Jesus: According to the Jesus Seminar'', Robert Walter Funk (Editor), Polebridge Press (1999), ISBN 0–944344–74–7</ref>  [[Thomas Jefferson]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] and a [[deism|deist]], created the [[Jefferson Bible]] entitled "The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth" that included only Jesus' ethical teachings because he did not believe in Jesus' divinity or any of the other supernatural aspects of the [[Bible]].

Philosopher and atheist [[Bertrand Russell]] saw Jesus' teachings and values as surpassed by other philosophers; Russell writes 'I cannot myself feel that either in the matter of wisdom or in the matter of virtue Christ stands quite as high as some other people known to History. I think I should put Buddha and Socrates above Him in those respects.'<ref>[http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm Russell, Bertrand, ''Why I am not a Christian''], March 6, 1927, Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]</ref> [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] saw [[Socrates]] and Jesus as foundational to Western culture and criticized them both. He considered Jesus' concern for the weak to be a reversal of noble morality and accused Christianity of spreading the concept of equal rights for all, which he opposed.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/antich.html "The Anti-Christ"], sections 54, 43</ref>

According to most Christian interpretations of the [[Bible]], the theme of Jesus' teachings was that of [[repentance]], [[agape|unconditional love]],<ref>{{niv|John|13:34–35|John 13:34–35}}</ref> [[forgiveness]] of [[sin]], [[Divine grace|grace]], and the coming of the [[Kingdom of God]].<ref>Sniegocki, John.

Hughes, F. A. [http://www.stempublishing.com/authors/hughes/GRACTRTH.html "Grace and Truth,"] STEM publishing 1972 (grace)</ref> Jesus extensively trained disciples who, after his death, spread his teachings. Within a few decades his followers comprised a religion clearly distinct from [[Judaism]]. Christianity spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]] under a version known as [[Nicene Christianity]] and became the [[state religion]] under [[Constantine the Great]]. Over the centuries, it spread to most of [[Europe]], and around the world.

Jesus has been [[Images of Jesus|drawn, painted, sculpted]] and [[Dramatic portrayals of Jesus|portrayed on stage and in films]] in many different ways, both serious and [[Jesus in Pop culture|humorous]]. The figure of Jesus features prominently in [[art]] and [[literature]]. A number of popular novels, such as ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', have also portrayed various ideas about Jesus, and a number of films, such as ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', have portrayed his life, death, and resurrection. Many of the sayings attributed to Jesus have become part of the culture of [[Western world|Western civilization]]. There are many items purported to be [[relics of Jesus]], of which the most famous are the [[Shroud of Turin]] and the [[Sudarium of Oviedo]].

Other legacies include a view of God as more lovingly parental, merciful, and more forgiving, and the growth of a belief in a blissful [[afterlife]] and in the [[resurrection of the dead]]. His teaching promoted the value of those who had commonly been regarded as inferior: women, the poor, ethnic outsiders, children, prostitutes, the sick, prisoners, etc. For over a thousand years, countless hospitals, orphanages, and schools have been founded explicitly in Jesus' name. Jesus and his message have been interpreted, explained and understood by many people. Jesus has been explained notably by [[Paul of Tarsus]], the [[Church Fathers]], including [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Martin Luther]], and more recently by [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] considered Jesus' teaching to be "the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man."<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/co/JeffersonBible/jeffintr.html The Jefferson Bible] Retrieved April 20, 2007</ref>

For some Jews, the legacy of Jesus has been a history of [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]],<ref> "Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate" by William Nicholls, 1993. Published by Jason Aronson Inc., 1995; "Mature Christianity: The Recognition and Repudiation of the Anti-Jewish Polemic in the New Testament" Norman A. Beck, Susquehanna Univ.

Wilken, Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, 1983</ref> although in the wake of [[the Holocaust]] many Christian groups have gone to considerable lengths to reconcile with Jews and to promote interfaith dialog and mutual respect. For others, Christianity has often been linked to European [[colonialism]] (see [[British Empire]], [[Portuguese Empire]], [[Spanish Empire]], [[French colonial empire]], [[Dutch colonial empire]]).<ref>''Of Revelation and Revolution, Volume 1: Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa'' by Jean Comaroff, John L. Comaroff 1991 University of Chicago Press; ''A Violent Evangelism: The Political and Religious Conquest of the Americas'' by Luis Rivera Pagan 1992 Westminster Press; ''The Americas in the Spanish World Order: The Justification for Conquest in the 17th Century'' by James Muldoon 1994 University of Pennsylvania Press; ''An Empire Divided: Religion, Republicanism, and the Making of French Colonialism, 1880–1914 by J.P.
