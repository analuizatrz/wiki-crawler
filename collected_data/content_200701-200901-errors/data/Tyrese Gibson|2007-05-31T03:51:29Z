==Biography==
===Early life===
Gibson was born in the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] district in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], where he attended Locke High School. His mother, Priscilla, raised him and his three older siblings as a single parent after Gibson's father left in 1983, who has one other step son, named Chris Goldsmith, who attends University of Maine. <ref name="scripps">{{cite web | title=Scripps Howard News Service | work=Tyrese Gibson on getting my grown man on | url=http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=GIBSON-FILM-06-21-06 | accessdate=June 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Gibson's career began when he won a talent show at the age of fourteen. An appearance in a 1997 [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement, singing the phrase "Always Coca-Cola",<ref name="baller">{{cite web | title=BallerStatus | work=Tyrese: Waist Deep | url=http://www.ballerstatus.net/beyond/read/id/04270158/ | accessdate=June 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> led to wider fame, and at the age of seventeen he modeled for Tommy Hilfiger.

===Career===
Initially an [[rapper|MC]],Tyrese Gibson rapped under the alias of ''Black-Ty'' and was a member of an underground group known as ''Triple Impact'' <ref name="baller"/>, but didn't hesitate to follow another career route as an opportunity to launch his [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] career came up first. He released his self-titled debut music album, which went [[Platinum single|platinum]], in [[1998]];<ref name="scripps" /> his second album, ''2000 Watts'', shares the name of the organization he founded to help inner city children. Gibson was given the role originally intended for [[Tupac Shakur]] in the 2001 film ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]''; the movie was a critical success and performed fairly at the box office. Gibson subsequently appeared in the 2003 box office success ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (opposite [[Paul Walker]]), as well as ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]'' (2004), ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'' (2005) and ''[[Annapolis (film)|Annapolis]]'' (2006), co-starring [[James Franco]]. Gibson was picked as one of [[People Magazine]]'s ''Sexiest Men of the Year'' in [[2000]]. 
Gibson has also established himself as a successful screenwriter, selling the pitches ''D.A. Verdict'' to [[MGM]] and ''Extortion'' to [[Universal Studios]]. In [[2006]], Gibson sold his first original spec script, ''To Each His Own'', to [[Screen Gems]]. He is to star in and produce all of the films. Gibson has also created [[HQ Pictures]], a television and film production company.  He has hired Mike Le as VP of development & production to oversee and develop projects under the company's banner.  Senior Development Executive, Rock Shaink, and Director of Development, Omar Shamout joined the staff in [[2006]]. 

Gibson's latest film is ''[[Waist Deep]]'', in which he plays a man fighting to rescue his son from kidnappers; his co-stars in the film, [[Meagan Good]] and [[Larenz Tate]], are personal friends of Gibson's in real life. <ref name="baller" /> Like several of his previous roles, the film is set in an urban environment, but Gibson has said that he does not view the role as a "step back", rather seeing the film as taking "another direction" due to some of its themes and action sequences.<ref name="baller" /> ''Waist Deep'' was released on [[June 23]], [[2006]].

Gibson prefers his music career to acting<ref name="scripps" />, but will focus on both areas. His rap persona was finally revitalized on [[December 12]],[[ 2006]], with the release of his newest album, titled ''Alter Ego'', with one disc featuring R&B (as Tyrese) and one disc featuring [[hip hop music|hip hop]] (as Black-Ty)<ref name="baller" />. His next film role will be in the big-budget action movie, ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', which is currently filming and is scheduled for a release in [[July 2007]]; the film's director, [[Michael Bay]], had Gibson in mind for the role before he was cast, and thus Gibson did not have to audition for the part.<ref name="movieweb">{{cite web | title=MovieWeb | work=INTERVIEW: Tyrese Gibson Gets In Waist Deep | url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/19/13219.php | accessdate=June 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Gibson may also star in a film version of the superhero [[Luke Cage]]; the script is currently being re-formatted.<ref name="movieweb" />

Gibson has been attatched to a new R&B supergroup entitled TGT with [[Ginuwine]] and Tank.  He is quoted in saying "With all the support our fans have given us individually over the years for our distinct signature styles, collectively we felt our fans deserved to hear great music in a way that they could never have imagined.  I've known these guys for years and they truly are like brothers, so it only felt right to come together as a trio to make history"  The group is first featured on Tank's remix to the song "Please Don't Go".  They also plans an international tour entitled "The Shirts Off Tour".
