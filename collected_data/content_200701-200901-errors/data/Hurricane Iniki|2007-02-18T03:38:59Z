'''Hurricane Iniki''' ''(pronounced E-Nee-Kee)'' ([[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] for Enid<ref name="cphc"/>) was the most powerful [[hurricane]] to strike the state of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in recorded history. Forming during the strong [[El Niño]] of 1991-1994, Iniki was one of eleven Central Pacific tropical cyclones during the [[1992 Pacific hurricane season|1992 season]]. The eye of Hurricane Iniki passed directly over the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] on [[September 11]], [[1992]] as a Category 4 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. It was the first hurricane to hit the state since [[Hurricane Iwa|Iwa]] in the [[1982 Pacific hurricane season|1982 season]], and the first major hurricane since [[Hurricane Dot (1959)|Hurricane Dot]] in 1959.

Iniki caused around $1.8&nbsp;billion (1992&nbsp;[[US dollars]]) in damage and 6&nbsp;deaths. At the time, Iniki was among the costliest [[United States]] hurricanes and remains one of the costliest hurricanes on record in the eastern Pacific.  The storm struck just weeks after [[Hurricane Andrew]], the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time, struck the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]].

Due to well-executed warnings, Iniki caused only six deaths. Damage was greatest on Kaua{{okina}}i, where the hurricane destroyed over 1,400 houses and severely damaged over 5,000. [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], though not directly in the path, experienced moderate damage from storm surge, though damage was much less there. 

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Iniki 1992 track.png}}
The origin of Iniki is unclear, but it possibly began as a [[tropical wave]] that exited the [[Africa]]n coast on [[August 18]]. It moved westward across the unfavorable [[Atlantic Ocean]] and crossed [[Central America]] into the [[Pacific]] on the 28th. The wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized. Conditions slowly became more favorable, and, as the convection concentrated around a center, the wave was classified Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on [[September 5]], located 1700&nbsp;[[mile]]s (2700&nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]]) southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Mexico]] or 1550&nbsp;miles (2500&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Hilo, Hawai'i|Hilo, Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until the 8th, when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm. Because it had already crossed 140º west, it was considered part of the central Pacific hurricane basin and was named Tropical Storm Iniki from the central Pacific naming list.

[[Image:Iniki 08 sept 1992 0256Z.jpg|thumb|right|Iniki (left) as a newly-formed tropical storm next to [[1992 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Orlene|Hurricane Orlene]]]]

Located at the southern periphery of a [[subtropical ridge]], Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on [[September 9]] while 470&nbsp;miles (760&nbsp;km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the Hawaiian islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on [[September 10]] while south-southwest of the island chain.<ref name="cphc"/>

As Iniki turned to the north, it continued to strengthen, reaching a peak of 145&nbsp;[[mph]] (230&nbsp;[[km/h]]) winds on [[September 11]] while 170&nbsp;miles (270&nbsp;km) south-southwest of [[Poipu, Hawaii|Po{{okina}}ipū]] on the island of Kaua{{okina}}i. It continued rapidly to the north-northeast, and made landfall on south-central Kauai early on the 12th with winds of 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h), making Iniki a Category 4 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. After crossing the island, Iniki rapidly accelerated north-northeastward, weakened rapidly, and was absorbed by a cold front as it lost tropical characteristics and became [[extratropical]] on [[September 13]] about halfway between [[Alaska]] and Hawai{{okina}}i.<ref name="cphc"/>

==Preparations==
The [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (CPHC) issued [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches]] for the hurricane well in advance.  Accurate forecasts allowed effective evacuations, minimizing deaths on the islands.

A hurricane watch was issued for Kaua{{okina}}i early on [[September 11]] and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day.<ref name="cphc"/> Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kaua{{okina}}i, 8,000&nbsp;people were housed in shelters, most of whom remembered [[Hurricane Iwa]] 10&nbsp;years prior. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage. During the evacuation of the island, people left days before to either family, friends, or to shelters. Because schools were canceled, traffic was light, and evacuation was well-executed.<ref name="assessment">{{cite web|author=US Army Corps of Engineers|year=1993|title=Hurricane Iniki Assessment|publisher=US Military|accessdate=2006-03-13|url=http://www3.csc.noaa.gov/hes_docs/postStorm/H_INIKI_ASSESSMENT_REVIEW_HES_UTILIZATION_INFO_DISSEMINATION.pdf}}</ref>

The CPHC issued a tropical storm warning for [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] on [[September 11]] which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day.<ref name="cphc"/> Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000&nbsp;people to evacuate to 110&nbsp;public shelters in O{{okina}}ahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of O{{okina}}ahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went to a family or friend's house for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during evacuating were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.<ref name="assessment"/>

==Impact==
{{Costliest Pacific hurricanes|align=right}}
Hurricane Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawai{{okina}}i, causing $1.8&nbsp;billion ($2.6&nbsp;billion in 2004 [[US dollars]]) in damage.  Most damage was on the island of Kaua{{okina}}i, where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power, although O{{okina}}ahu also suffered significant damage. Iniki also was responsible for 6&nbsp;deaths.<ref name="cphc"/>

The hurricane nearly struck the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]]. Had it hit there, Iniki, along with [[Hurricane Andrew]] and [[Typhoon Omar]], would have struck each of the three [[National Weather Service]] offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period.<ref name="report">{{cite web|author=Ronald H. Brown|year=1993|title=Natural Disaster Survey Report: Hurricane Iniki|accessdate=2006-03-13|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/iniki/introtoc.pdf}}</ref>

===Kaua{{okina}}i===
Hurricane Iniki made landfall on the south-central portion of Kaua{{okina}}i island, bringing its dangerous inner core to the entire island.<ref name="cphc"/> Upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.5&ndash;6&nbsp;feet (1.4&ndash;1.8&nbsp;m), with some portions of the coastlines having high water marks of up to 18&nbsp;feet (5.5&nbsp;m). In addition, strong waves of up to 35&nbsp;feet (10.5&nbsp;m) in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours, causing a debris line of more than 800&nbsp;feet (250&nbsp;m) inland. Because it moved quickly through the island, there were no reports of significant rainfall.<ref name="assessment"/>

[[Image:Iniki Tree Winds.jpg|left|thumb|Wind damage to trees from Iniki]]
Hurricane Iniki's high winds caused extensive damage in Kaua{{okina}}i. 1,421&nbsp;houses were completely destroyed, and 63 were lost from the storm surge and wave action. 5,152&nbsp;homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage.<ref name="cphc"/> On the south coast, hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well. A few were restored quickly, though some took several years to be rebuilt. One hotel, the [[Coco Palms Resort]] famous for Elvis' [[Blue Hawaii]], remained closed over 10&nbsp;years after the hurricane.<ref name="kauai">{{cite web|author=Anthony Sommer|year=2002|title=The people of Kauai lived through a nightmare when the powerful storm struck|publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|accessdate=2006-03-13|url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/09/08/news/story5.html}}</ref> 
Destroyed housing across the island left more than 7,000&nbsp;people homeless after the storm's passage.<ref name="stats">{{cite web|author=Unknown|year=1992|title=Broadcast Journalism:  Write to the Bite|publisher=Unknown|accessdate=2006-03-13|url=http://www.mohs.k12.hi.us/media-central/docs/bj-docs/write-to-the-bite-info-sheet-2k5.doc}}</ref>

[[Image:Iniki Damaged Sidewalk.jpg|right|thumb|Sidewalk and tree damage from Iniki]]
Iniki's [[Category 4]] winds also downed 26.5% of the island's transmission poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800&nbsp;mile (1300&nbsp;km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period of time.<ref name="stats"/> Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power for up to three months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector.<ref name="cphc"/> Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, <ref name="stats"/> what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.<ref name="cphc"/>

Most of Iniki's damage occurred in Kaua{{okina}}i. On the island, one person died when struck by debris, while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her. Offshore, two [[Japan]]ese nationals died when their boat capsized. The reduced death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation. More than 100&nbsp;injuries can be attributed to Iniki, though most occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane.<ref name="cphc"/>

Among those on Kaua{{okina}}i was filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]], who was preparing for the final day of shooting of the movie ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. He and his 130 cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during Iniki's passage.<ref name="spielberg">{{cite web|author=Al Kamen|year=1992|title=Hawaii Hurricane Devastates Kauai|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2006-03-13|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/weather/hurricane/poststories/iniki.htm}}</ref>

===O{{okina}}ahu===
Upon passing by O{{okina}}ahu, Iniki produced tides of 1.7&ndash;3&nbsp;feet (0.5&ndash;0.9&nbsp;m) above normal.<ref name="assessment"/> Prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of O{{okina}}ahu, with the areas most affected being [[Barbers Point]] through [[Kaena Point|Ka{{okina}}ena]].<ref name="cphc"/> The Wai{{okina}}anae coastline experienced the most damage, with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments.<ref name="oahu">{{cite web|author=Ron Hashiro|year=1993|title=Hurricane Iniki Rallies Amateurs|publisher=American Amateur Radio Relay League, Inc|accessdate=2006-03-13|url=http://ronhashiro.htohananet.com/am-radio/articles/iniki.html}}</ref> In all, Hurricane Iniki caused several million dollars in property damage,<ref name="assessment"/> and 2&nbsp;deaths on O{{okina}}ahu.<ref name="cphc"/>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Iniki Storm Surge.jpg|right|thumb|Storm surge from Iniki]]
Immediately after the storm, many were relieved to have survived the worst of the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4 hurricane]]; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information, as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days. Using food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers, communities held lavish parties to overcome the situation. Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kaua{{okina}}i citizens insisted on paying. Because the hurricane destroyed much of their belongings, many groups gathered for video parties powered by portable generators. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawai{{okina}}i, including the [[Honolulu Symphony]], provided free concerts to the victims.<ref name="kauai"/>

Looting occurred in the aftermath of Iniki, though it was very minor. A group of [[Army Corps of Engineers]], who experienced the looting of [[Hurricane Andrew]] just weeks before, were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island. Kaua{{okina}}i citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies, though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help.<ref name="kauai"/> The military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs, though, and help arrived before local officials requested aid.<ref name="fema">{{cite web|author=J. Dexter Peach|year=1993|title=What Hurricane Andrew Tells Us About How To Fix FEMA|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|accessdate=2006-03-18|url=http://www.theinformationist.com/index/trifecta/comments/fema_andrew_katrina_gao/}}</ref>

In the months after the storm, many insurance companies left Hawai{{okina}}i. To combat this, [[Governor of Hawaii|State Governor]] [[John D. Waihee III]] enacted the Hurricane Relief Fund in 1993 to help unprotected Hawaiians. The fund was never needed for another Hawai{{okina}}i hurricane, and it was stopped in 2000 when insurance companies returned to the island.<ref name="hawmoney">{{cite news|year=2001|title=State should keep hurricane fund intact for next disaster|publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|accessdate=2006-03-18|url=http://starbulletin.com/2001/12/30/editorial/editorials.html}}</ref>

The name Iniki was retired due to this storm in 1993, and was replaced with Iolana in the [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#Central North Pacific (Date line to 140W)|Central North Pacific tropical storm list]]. Since that list is rotated through regardless of year, Iolana has not been used for any storm and is not likely to be used for decades due to the relative rarity of storm formation in the Central Pacific.
