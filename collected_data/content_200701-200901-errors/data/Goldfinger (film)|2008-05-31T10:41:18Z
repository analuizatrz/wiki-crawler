'''''Goldfinger''''' ([[1964 in film|1964]]) is the third [[James Bond film series|James Bond film]], as well as the third to star [[Sean Connery]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6 agent]] [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. It is based on the [[Goldfinger (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. The film also stars [[Honor Blackman]] and [[Gert Fröbe]]. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and was the first of four Bond films directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The story has Bond following gold smuggler [[Auric Goldfinger]], who plans a nuclear detonation inside the [[Fort Knox]] [[United States Bullion Depository|gold depository]].

The film was the first official Bond [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]; The film made cinematic history when it recaptured its production costs in record-setting time, despite a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. ''Goldfinger'' was also the first Bond film to use a pop star to sing the theme song during the titles, which would follow for every Bond film since except ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.<ref name="making"/>

==Plot==
In the pre-title sequence, James Bond destroys a Mexican drug lord's base with plastic explosives and defeats an assassin by electrocution. The story begins in [[Miami Beach]], [[Florida]], with CIA agent [[Felix Leiter]] delivering a message to Bond from [[M (James Bond)|M]] to watch [[Auric Goldfinger]]. Bond foils Goldfinger's cheating at [[gin rummy]] by distracting his employee, [[Jill Masterson]]. After blackmailing Goldfinger into losing, Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship in Bond's hotel suite. Bond is knocked out by Goldfinger's Korean manservant Oddjob, while Jill is covered in gold paint and succumbs to epidermal suffocation.

In London, Bond learns that his true mission is determining how Goldfinger transports gold internationally. He plays a high-stakes golf game with his adversary (with a recovered bar of [[Nazi gold]] as the prize); despite Goldfinger's cheating, Bond wins the match. Goldfinger warns Bond to stay out of his business by having Oddjob decapitate a statue with throwing his steel-rimmed [[bowler hat]]. Undeterred, Bond follows him to Switzerland, where he unintentionally foils an attempt by Jill's sister Tilly Masterson to assassinate Goldfinger for the death of her sister, Jill.

Bond sneaks into Goldfinger's plant and overhears him talking to a Red Chinese agent about "Operation Grand Slam." Leaving, he encounters Tilly as she is about to make a second attempt on Goldfinger's life, but accidentally trips an alarm. During their escape, Oddjob breaks Tilly's neck with his hat. Bond attempts to escape using his modified [[Aston Martin DB5]] car but is recaptured. Goldfinger has Bond tied to a table underneath an industrial [[laser]], which slowly begins to slice the table in half. Bond lies to Goldfinger that British Intelligence knows about Grand Slam, causing Goldfinger to spare Bond's life until he can determine how much the spy actually knows.

Bond is transported by private aircraft flown by Goldfinger's personal pilot, Pussy Galore, to Goldfinger's [[Kentucky]] stud farm near Fort Knox. He escapes and witnesses Goldfinger meeting U.S. mafiosi, who have brought the materials he needs for Operation Grand Slam; at the end of the briefing, Goldfinger has them all killed. Bond is recaptured, but has learned enough to deduce that Goldfinger intends to irradiate the U.S. gold supply stored at the Depository at Fort Knox with an atomic device, therefore rendering it useless for almost 60 years and greatly increasing the value of his own gold. This will also give the Chinese increased power following economic chaos in the West.

[[Image:007Goldfingerlaserclassic.jpg|thumb|left|Goldfinger about to slice Bond in half with a laser.]]
Operation Grand Slam begins with the women pilots of Galore's Flying Circus spraying lethal [[nerve gas]] over Fort Knox to dispatch its garrison, though Goldfinger had told Galore that the soldiers would just be rendered unconscious. However, Bond had earlier seduced her and persuaded her to contact the CIA, who had then replaced the poison with a harmless gas. The military personnel of Fort Knox convincingly play dead until they are certain that they can prevent the criminals escaping the fort with the bomb. Goldfinger's Chinese agents gain entry to the vault. Bond is then handcuffed to the atomic device and lowered into the vault with it. Goldfinger's forces are surrounded by Army personnel and wiped out; but, disguised as a US colonel, Goldfinger escapes. In the vault, Bond unlocks his handcuffs, kills Oddjob, and vainly tries to deactivate the atomic device until a specialist accompanying Leiter runs in and stops the countdown at seven seconds; the timer indicates "007".

With Fort Knox safe, the American President invites Bond to the [[White House]] to thank him. Bond boards a [[Lockheed JetStar]] for [[Washington D.C.]], but it is hijacked by Goldfinger. Bond and Goldfinger struggle for the latter's revolver; and the revolver fires, shattering a window; Goldfinger is blown out. Bond rescues Galore, and they parachute safely onto a beach.

==Production==
''Goldfinger'' had what was then considered a large budget of [[USD|$]]3 million, and was the first James Bond film classified as a box-office [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].<ref name="making">{{cite video |title=Behind the Scenes with 'Goldfinger' |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] Home Entertainment Inc |year= 1995 |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218836/}}</ref> [[Guy Hamilton]] directed the film. [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], who directed the previous films &ndash; ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' and ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]'' &ndash; chose to film ''[[Moll Flanders#Film, TV or theatrical adaptations|The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders]]'' (1965) instead after a pay dispute.<ref name=mi6production>{{cite web | title = Production Notes - Goldfinger | publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]] | url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/gf_production.php3?t=gf&s=gf | accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> Hamilton felt that he needed to make Bond less of a "superman" by making the villains seem more powerful.<ref name="thrill"/> Hamilton knew [[Ian Fleming]], as both were involved during intelligence matters in the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Bouzerau | first = Laurent | title = The Art of Bond | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers]] | date = 2006 | location = London | pages = 17 | isbn = 0-7522-1551-5}}</ref> and had turned down directing ''Dr. No''.<ref>Bouzerau, 127</ref> 

[[Richard Maibaum]], who wrote the previous films, returned to adapt the [[Goldfinger (novel)|seventh James Bond novel]]. Maibaum fixed the novel's heavily criticised [[plot hole]], where Goldfinger actually attempts to empty Fort Knox. In the film, Bond notes it would take twelve days for Goldfinger to steal the gold, before the villain reveals he actually intends to irradiate it.<ref name="thrill"/> However, [[Harry Saltzman]] disliked the first draft, and brought in [[Paul Dehn]] to revise it.<ref name="thrill"/> Hamilton said Dehn "brought out the British side of things".<ref>Bouzerau, 31</ref> Connery disliked his draft, so Maibaum returned.<ref name="thrill">{{cite book |author= James Chapman |title= Licence to Thrill |publisher= Cinema and Society |date= 1999 |location= [[London]]/[[New York City]] |pages= 100-110 |isbn= 1-86064-387-6}}</ref> [[Wolf Mankowitz]], an uncredited screenwriter on ''Dr. No'', suggested the scene where Oddjob puts his car into a car crusher to dispose of a dead body.<ref name=mi6production/>

===Casting===
Connery reprised the role of Bond for the third time in a row. His salary rose, but a pay dispute later broke out during filming. After suffering a back injury when filming the scene where Oddjob knocks Bond unconscious in Miami, the dispute was settled: EON and Connery agreed to a deal where the actor would receive 5% of the grosses of each Bond film he starred in. It was while filming ''Goldfinger'', that Connery also became a fan of golf.<ref name=mi6production/>

Blackman was selected for the role of Pussy Galore because of her role in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name="making"/> Concerned about censors, the producers thought about changing the character's name to "Kitty Galore",<ref name="phenom">{{cite video |title=The Goldfinger Phenomenon |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] Home Entertainment Inc |date=1995 |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948442/}}</ref> but they and Hamilton decided "if you were a ten-year old boy and knew what the name meant, you weren't a ten-year old boy, you were a dirty little fucker.

In order to dub him, he had to double the speed of his performance to get the right tempo.<ref name=empire/> He was dubbed over by Michael Collins.<ref name="making"/> 

Director Guy Hamilton cast Harold Sakata, an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] silver medalist weight lifter, as Oddjob after seeing him on a wrestling programme.<ref name="making"/> Hamilton called Sakata an "absolutely charming man", and found that "he had a very unique way of moving, [so] in creating Oddjob I used all of Harold's own characteristics".<ref name=villain>Bouzerau, 165</ref> Sakata was badly burned when filming his death scene.<ref name=mi6production/> 

Shirley  Eaton was sent by her agent to meet [[Harry Saltzman]], and she agreed to take the part if the nudity was done tastefully. It took an hour-and-a-half to apply the paint to her body. The area of her chest between her breasts and bellybutton was left unpainted so she could breathe.<ref name=empire/>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] on ''Goldfinger'' commenced on [[20 January]] [[1964]] in [[Miami, Florida]], at the [[Fontainebleau Hotel]]. Sean Connery never travelled to the United States during filming; his entire performance was filmed in Europe &ndash; primarily at [[Pinewood Studios]] where portions of the Fontainebleau were recreated in April 1964. Goldfinger's estate was built at Pinewood.<ref name=officialguide/> The scene in which Tilly Masterson attempts to snipe Goldfinger was filmed near the [[Pilatus Aircraft]] Factory, Stans and [[Furka pass]] in [[Switzerland]]. Other scenes set in the country were shot in [[Buckinghamshire]] during May 1964. The golf club scene was shot at [[Stoke Poges]], while the car chase involving Bond's Aston Martin and Goldfinger's henchmen outside his Swiss lair was filmed at [[Black Park]]. [[Ian Fleming]] visited the set of ''Goldfinger'', but he died a few months later in August 1964 shortly before it was released. Principal photography was completed later that month.<ref name="making"/> The [[second unit]] filmed at [[Kentucky]], and these shots was edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood.<ref name=officialguide/> 

To shoot Pussy Galore's Flying Circus gassing the soldiers at [[Fort Knox]], the pilots were only allowed to fly above 3000 feet. Hamilton recalled this was "hopeless", and they flew at about 500 feet, "and the military went absolutely ape".<ref name=empire/> For security reasons, the filmmakers were not allowed to film inside the [[United States Bullion Depository]], though exterior photography was permitted. All sets for the interiors of the building were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios.<ref name="making"/> The filmmakers had no clue as to what the depository looked like, so "we [the crew] decided to let our imaginations run wild". [[Ken Adam]]'s idea behind the design was seeing gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars. [[Harry Saltzman]] disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built.<ref name=prison>Bouzerau, 62-65</ref> The [[comptroller]] of Fort Knox later sent a letter to Adam and the production team, complimenting them on their imaginative depiction of the vault.<ref name="making"/> [[United Artists]] even had irate letters from people wondering "how could a British film unit be allowed inside Fort Knox?"<ref name=prison/> Adam recalled, "In the end I was pleased that I wasn't allowed into Fort Knox, because it allowed me to do whatever I wanted."<ref name=empire/>

===Effects===
{{See also|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
[[Image:DB5-2.jpg|thumb|Two [[Aston Martin DB5]]s were built for production, one of which had no gadgets.]]
''Goldfinger'' was the first Bond film with the budget to showcase unique technology that became a staple of the film series.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} Hamilton remarked, "Before that, gadgets were not really a part of Bond's world." [[Production designer]] [[Ken Adam]] chose the Aston Martin because it was the latest British sports cars. The company was initially reluctant, but were finally convinced to a [[product placement]] deal. In the script, the car was only armed with [[smokescreen]], but everbody began suggesting to fill it with gadgets: Hamilton conceived the revolving license plate because he had been getting lots of parking tickets, whilst his stepson suggested the ejector seat (which he'd seen on television).<ref name=aston>Bouzerau, 110-111</ref> Adam and engineerer John Stears overhauled the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe, installing these and other features into a car during six weeks.<ref name="making"/> Another car without the gadgets was created, which was eventually furnished for publicity purposes. It was reused for ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.<ref name=officialguide/>

[[Laser]]s did not exist in 1959 when the book was written, and they were a novelty in the movie. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel more fresh.<ref name="thrill"/> Harry Saltzman had learnt of the new technology "that could shoot all the way to the moon". Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. [[Ken Adam]] was advised on the laser's design by two [[Harvard University|Harvard]] scientists who helped design the water reactor in ''Dr No''.<ref name=prison/> The laserbeam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a [[blowtorch]] from underneath the table Bond was strapped to.<ref>Bouzerau, 237</ref>

The opening credit sequence, as well as the posters for the advertising campaign, were designed by [[graphic artist]] Robert Brownjohn. Actress [[Vicky Kennedy]], who appeared in the film as Bond's masseuse at the Fontainebleau Hotel, also played the golden woman in the credits and posed for the posters.<ref name="phenom"/> The model jet used for wide shots of Goldfinger's [[Lockheed JetStar]] was refurbished to be used as the presidential plane that crashes at the film's end.<ref name=officialguide/>

===Music===
{{main|Goldfinger (soundtrack)}}

[[Shirley Bassey]] sang the theme song "[[Goldfinger (song)|Goldfinger]]", and she would go on to sing the theme songs for two other Bond films as well. The song was composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], with lyrics by [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]]. Newley originally sang the song, but Bassey's recording was used in the film and was featured on the soundtrack. Newley's version was released in the 30th anniversary compilation album ''[[The Best of Bond...James Bond]]''. The theme was an international [[hit single]], achieving a spot in the [[Billboard Hot 100]] top five. The album went [[gold album|gold]], selling over a million copies in the United States alone; it reached #21 in the UK charts.<ref name="phenom"/> The film score was composed by John Barry with the UK soundtrack featuring 4 tracks that didn't appear on the US soundtrack.

==Release and reception==
''Goldfinger'' was originally released on [[17 September]], [[1964]], in the [[United Kingdom]], and on [[21 December]], [[1964]], in the [[United States]]. <!-- ''Goldfinger'' was temporarily banned in [[Israel]] due to [[Gert Fröbe]]'s connections with the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]]. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a [[Jewish]] family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during [[World War II]].--> To promote the film, the two [[Aston Martin DB5]]s were showcased at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], and it was dubbed "the most famous car in the world".<ref name=officialguide/> Sales of the car rose.<ref name=aston/> [[Corgi Classics Limited|Corgi Toys]] began its decades-long relationship with the Bond franchise, producing a toy of the car.

==Impact==
''Goldfinger'''s popularity led to parodies of James Bond appearing in the form of "secret agent" comics, television programs, and a spoof of Ian Fleming's [[Casino Royale (novel)|first bond novel]] ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' in [[1967]]. The laser scene was also popular and parodied; in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', James ''Bont'' is strapped to a table and is about to be cut by a laser, and makes his escape, only to be foiled by [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. ''Bont'' later remarks to the Goldfinger character "Aren't you going to tell me your secret plans for world domination first?" to which he replies: "Oh no, I'm not going to make that mistake again"<ref>{{cite episode |title= You Only Move Twice |episodelink= You Only Move Twice |series= The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |credits= [[John Swartzwelder]] (writer) |station= [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate= 1996-11-03 |season= 8 |number= 2}}</ref> ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' has Dexter on the Photo Finisher, which mirrors the scene from the film.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Photo Finish |series= Dexter's Laboratory |serieslink= Dexter's Laboratory |station=[[Cartoon Network]] |airdate= 1997 |season= 2|number= 26}}</ref> The rest of Fleming's Bond novels also gained popularity as a result of the success of ''Goldfinger''.<ref name="phenom"/> In the last years of [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] and according to [[Toby Harnden]], the [[South Armagh Sniper (1990-1997)|South Armagh sniper]] was dubbed ironically ''Goldfinger'' by the [[tabloid press]].

An episode of the U.S. television program ''[[MythBusters]]'' considered the scenario of an explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes. Their investigation concluded that a sudden depressurisation as depicted in the film would not occur.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Explosive Decompression, Frog Giggin', Rear Axle |series=MythBusters |serieslink=MythBusters |airdate=2004-01-18 |season=1 |number=10 }}</ref> ''Mythbusters'' also twice investigated if death could be caused by full body painting, as was depicted in the film. While this was proved to be possible - likely due to [[heat stroke]] and not epidermal suffocation as depicted in the film - it was found that such a death would be very slow, unlike in the film.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Larry’s Lawn Chair Balloon, Poppy Seed Drug Test, Goldfinger |series=MythBusters |serieslink=MythBusters |number=3 |airdate=2003-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Myths Revisited |series=MythBusters |serieslink=MythBusters |season=2 |number=14 |airdate=2004-06-08}}</ref> The MythBusters also recreated the ejector seat of the DB5. Although their car was not an Aston Martin, they proved that such ejector seat works nearly identically to what was seen on film.
