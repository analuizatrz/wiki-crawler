The '''Woolly Bugger''' is an [[fly lure| artificial fly]] commonly categorized as a wet fly or streamer and is fished under the water surface.  It is a popular and widely used pattern for both freshwater and saltwater game fish and is generally listed as one of the top patterns to have in any fly box. John Gierach, a noted [[Fly Fishing]] writer discussed the Woolly Bugger first in his chapter on streamers in ''Good Flies.''<ref>{{cite book |last=Gierach |first=John |title=Good Flies|year=2000 |publisher=The Lyons Press|location=New York |pages=164 |isbn=1585741396}}</ref>. Woolly Buggers are typically fished in streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and tidal flats.  Today, Woolly Buggers are tied in a wide variety of styles and colors to imitate a wide range of game fish prey.[[Image:BlackandBrownBeadheadWoollyBugger.jpg|thumb|300px|right|#8 Black and Brown Beadhead Woolly Bugger]]

<blockquote>
The Woolly Bugger is so effective, it should be banned from some watersheds.  I suspect its effectiveness is due to its resemblance to so many edible creatures in the water--nymphs, leeches, salamanders, or even small sculpins.  Its tail undulating behind a fiber, bubble-filled body is just too much for most fish to resist.  I just looks like a meal!-'''Bill Hunter''' in ''The Professionals' Favorite Flies''<ref>{{cite book |last=Kreh |first=Lefty |title=The Professionals' Favorite Flies Vol II |publisher=Oddessy Editions |location=Birmingham, Alabama |pages=41 |year=1994 }}</ref>

== Origin ==
Although the original Woolly Bugger pattern was believed to have been created by Russell Blessing, Pennsylvania Fly Tyer as early as 1967 to resemble a [[hellgrammite]], or [[Dobsonfly]] nymph, its precise origin is unknown, but is clearly an evolution of the Woolly Worm fly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Soucie |first=Gary |title=Woolly Wisdom |year=2006 |publisher=Frank Amato Publications |location=Portland, Oregon |pages=112-13 |isbn=1571883525 }}</ref>.

== Imitates ==
The Woolly Bugger, depending the specific material used and how it is fished can be assumed to resemble large nymphs, baitfish, drowning terrestrial insects, clamworms, crayfish, shrimp or crabs<ref>{{cite book |last=Soucie |first=Gary |title=Woolly Wisdom |year=2006 |publisher=Frank Amato Publications |location=Portland, Oregon |pages=124-125 |isbn=1571883525 }}</ref>, <ref>{{cite book |last=Cordes |first=Ron |coauthors=Kaufmann, Randall |title=Lake Fishing With A Fly|year=1984 |publisher=Frank Amato Publications |location=Portland, Oregon |pages=92-93 |isbn=10936608269}}</ref>, <ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=George V. |title=A Fly Fisher's Guide To Saltwater Naturals and Their Imitation |year=1994 |publisher=Ragged Mountain Press|location=Camden, Maine |pages=151 |isbn=0070531668 }}</ref>, <ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Dick |coauthors=Allen, Farrow |title=Flies for Bass and Panfish |year=1992 |publisher=Northland Press Inc. |location=Inervale, NH |pages=58 |isbn=0936644109 }}</ref>, <ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Harry |title=Fly Fishing For Smallmouth Bass |year=1989 |publisher=Nick Lyons Books |location=New York |pages=141, 155, 160 |isbn=0941130-85-1 }}</ref>, <ref>{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Dave |title=Taking Trout |year=2002 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |pages=195 |isbn=0811729060 }}</ref>.
