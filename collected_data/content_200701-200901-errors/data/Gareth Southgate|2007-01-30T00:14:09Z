'''Gareth Harold Southgate''' (born [[September 3]] [[1970]] in [[Crawley]], [[Sussex]]) is a former [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]], currently [[manager (football)|manager]] of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the English [[FA Premier League|Premiership]].

==Playing Career==

===[[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]===

Southgate began his career at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], playing in central midfield. He became captain and led the club to the 1994 [[Football League Division One|Division One]] title. After the south-London club's relegation from the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]], he moved to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a fee of 2.5 million pounds, having made 151 appearances over four seasons.

At Villa he was converted into a [[defender (football)|centre-back]] and was part of a formidable defence. In his first season he lifted the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and Aston Villa qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. Southgate played in every Premiership game during the [[1998-99 in English football|1998-99]] season. He continued to play for Villa in the [[1999-00 in English football|1999-00]] season, but handed in a transfer request just before [[Euro 2000]] citing a desire to move to a more ambitious club.{{fact}} [[John Gregory]], the then manager of Villa, attempted to keep his club captain but after a year on the transfer list he left the [[Birmingham]] club in 2001.

===Northwards to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]===

Southgate did not sign for one of the major clubs as many predicted but instead became Middlesbrough manager [[Steve McClaren]]'s first signing for the club. This may have partially been due to the opportunity to reunite his defensive pairing with [[Ugo Ehiogu]] with whom he was a centre-back at Villa. Immediately he became a firm favourite at the [[Riverside Stadium|Riverside]], winning the club's Player of the Year award in his first season after a series of assured displays.

Southgate was handed the captaincy for the [[2002-03 in English football|2002-03]] season when [[Paul Ince]] left the club and became the first Boro captain to lift a major trophy when he helped them win the Carling Cup at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in February [[2004]], although his season ended shortly after that win, when he suffered knee ligament damage. There were strong rumours that Southgate could be set for a move to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] following [[Rio Ferdinand]]'s ban for missing a drug test in January [[2004]],{{fact}} but it turned out to be nothing more than paper talk. He later committed his final playing years to Middlesbrough, signing until [[2007]].

===International career===

Southgate made his debut for [[England national football team|England]] as a substitute against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in 1996. He was then named in [[Terry Venables]]' squad for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 1996]] on home soil. At the European championship Southgate played a towering role in England's charge to the semi-finals. However Southgate's missed penalty against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the semi-final sent the hosts crashing out. Southgate also played in the [[Football World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]] and [[2000 European Football Championship|Euro 2000]]. Gareth had won 57 England [[cap (football)|caps]] and was disappointed not to add to the figure during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] finals in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]. However in the penultimate warm-up game ahead of the finals he captained England for the second half of a 1-1 draw with South Korea. His 50th cap came in 1-1 draw with Portugal at [[Villa Park, England|Villa Park]] in September [[2002]].

His final appearance as a professional footballer came in the 2006 UEFA Cup Final as captain of Middlesbrough, in a 4-0 defeat.

==Management career==

Steve McClaren's departure from Middlesbrough, coupled with [[Terry Venables]] deciding not to return to Riverside, saw Southgate emerge as chairman Steve Gibson's choice to be the next manager. Southgate does not currently hold a [[UEFA Pro Licence]] and it appeared that the Premier League would therefore not sanction his appointment. However on [[June 7]] 2006 Southgate was indeed unveiled as the new manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. Southgate has now effectively retired from playing to concentrate on management, although he is still registered to play in case the club suffers an injury crisis. This makes him the first player-manager in the Premiership for seven years.<ref> [http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,1~837315,00.html]</ref>

Southgate recorded his biggest win as manager at home to Bolton Wanderers, the team he lifted the Carling Cup against in 2004. Middlesbrough saw goals from Speed (og), Xavier, Viduka (2) and Downing to give [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] to give the home team a 5-1 win on 20/01/2007.
