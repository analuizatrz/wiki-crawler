Established in 1769 by [[Congregational Church|Congregational]] minister [[Eleazar Wheelock]] with funds largely raised by the efforts of Native American preacher [[Samson Occom]], the College's initial mission was to educate and Christianize the Native Americans in the area.

== History ==
[[Image:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-02 03 - Charter.jpg.jpg|thumb|right|The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in [[Baker Memorial Library]]. The Charter was signed on [[December 13]], [[1769]], on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]].]]

Dartmouth was founded by [[Eleazar Wheelock]], a [[Puritan]] minister from Connecticut, who sought to establish a school to train Indians as ministers to spread civilization and Christianity. Wheelock's inspiration for such an establishment largely resulted from his relationship with [[Mohican]] Indian [[Samson Occom]]. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock’s tutelage from 1743 to 1747 and later moved to [[Long Island]] to preach to the Montauks.<ref name="history-lesson">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~speccoll/Resources/DartmouthHistory/DartmouthHistory.shtml | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis Lane | last = Childs | work = Dartmouth Alumni Magazine | date = December 1957 | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>

Wheelock instituted Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1999/Hoefnagel_Close.html | title = Eleazar Wheelock's Two Schools | first = Dick | last = Hoefnagel | coauthors = Virginia L. Close | work = Dartmouth College Library Bulletin | date = November 1999 | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school’s operations. To this end, Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. Occom, accompanied by Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money in the dissenting churches of that nation. With the funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.<ref name="history-lesson"/>

Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution &ndash; primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. Receiving the best land offer from New Hampshire, Wheelock approached the Royal Governor of the Province of New Hampshire [[John Wentworth (governor)|John Wentworth]] for a charter. Wentworth, acting in the name [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of the United Kingdom]], granted Dartmouth a [[royal charter]] on [[December 13]], [[1769]], establishing the final [[colonial college]] and naming the institution after his English friend, [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]].<ref name="history-lesson"/> Dartmouth's purpose, according to the original charter, was to provide for the [[Christianization]], instruction, and education of "youth of the Indian Tribes in this land [...] and also of English youth and any others." Given the failure of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new College as one primarily for whites.<ref name="chi">{{cite web | url = http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2002/08/daily-08-30-2002.shtml | title = Samson Occom | publisher = Christian History Institute | accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}</ref><ref name="history-lesson"/>

[[Image:DanielWebster DartmouthCollegeCase.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by Robert Clayton Burns (1962) depicting Daniel Webster arguing ''Dartmouth College v. Woodward''.]]
Wheelock had established a collegiate department within Moor's Charity School in 1768. In 1770, he moved the school to Hanover in 1770, where the College granted its first degrees in 1771.<ref>{{cite book | first = Dick | last = Hoefnagel | coauthors = Virginia L. Close | title = Eleazar Wheelock and the Adventurous Founding of Dartmouth College | location = Hanover, New Hampshire | publisher = Durand Press for Hanover Historical Society | year = 2002 }}</ref> Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called [[Brothertown Indians]] in New York.<ref name="history-lesson"/><ref name="chi"/>

In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic [[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|Dartmouth College case]], in which the State of [[New Hampshire]]'s 1816 attempt to amend the College's royal charter to make the school a public university was challenged. An institution called [[Dartmouth University]] occupied the College buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the College continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.<ref name="history-lesson"/> [[Daniel Webster]], an [[alumnus]] of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an [[Contract Clause|illegal impairment of a contract]] by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the College. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous and frequently quoted words: "It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it."<ref name="history-lesson"/>

[[Image:Dartmouth Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Lithograph of the President's House, Thornton Hall, Dartmouth Hall, and Wentworth Hall, circa 1834. The lithograph depicts the reverse of the actual scene.]]

Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the twentieth century. Prior to this period, the College had been relatively unknown and poorly funded.<ref name="trd-wheelock"/> Under the presidency of [[William Jewett Tucker]] (1893-1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body.  Twenty new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having "refounded Dartmouth" and bringing it into national prestige.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~presoff/succession/tucker.html | title = William Jewett Tucker | publisher = Office of the President | accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}</ref> Presidents [[Ernest Fox Nichols]] (1909-16) and [[Ernest Martin Hopkins]] (1916-45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing [[College admissions in the United States|selective admissions]] in the 1920s.<ref name="trd-wheelock"/> [[John Sloan Dickey]], serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts (particularly public policy and international relations).<ref name="trd-wheelock"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~presoff/succession/dickey.html | title = John Sloan Dickey | publisher = Office of the President | accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}</ref>

Dartmouth, previously serving as a men's college, admitted women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ask.dartmouth.edu/categories/stulife/11.html | publisher = Dartmouth College | title = When did Dartmouth become co-educational? | work = AskDartmouth | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref> At about the same time, the College adopted its "[[#The Dartmouth Plan|Dartmouth Plan]]" of academic scheduling.

During the 1990s, the College saw a major academic overhaul under President [[James O. Freedman]] and a controversial 1999 initiative to alter the character of the school's single-sex Greek houses.<ref name="trd-wheelock"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~presoff/succession/freedman.html | title = James O.

Dartmouth also grants degrees in nineteen Arts & Sciences graduate programs.<ref name="about-dartmouth-facts"/> Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three graduate schools: [[Dartmouth Medical School]] (established 1797), [[Thayer School of Engineering]] (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and [[Tuck School of Business]] (1900). With these graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of "Dartmouth University";<ref name="about-dartmouth-facts"/> however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]''), the school uses the name "Dartmouth College" for the entire institution.<ref name="history-lesson"/>

Dartmouth employs a total of 597 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities.<ref name="about-dartmouth-facts"/> Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the [[Dartmouth Conferences]], the [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]], [[Dartmouth BASIC]], and [[Dartmouth ALGOL 30]].

=== The Dartmouth Plan ===
[[Image:Dartmouth College Baker building.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baker Memorial Library]] at Dartmouth College]]
Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week [[academic term]]s. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply "D-Plan") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.<ref name="d-plan-admin">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/apply/generalinfo/overview/dplan.html | title = D-Plan | publisher = Admissions and Financial Aid| accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}</ref> During all other terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.<ref name="d-plan-admin"/> The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for twelve total terms over the course of their academic career.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/working-rules.html | title = Working Rules and Procedures | publisher = 
Office of the Registrar | accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}</ref>

The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described by some commentators as "a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds."<ref name="trd-wheelock"/> Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect.

=== Admissions ===

Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees which includes the College president and the state governor (both ''ex officio''), eight elected trustees nominated by the board itself (charter trustees), and eight elected trustees nominated by alumni (alumni trustees).<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2003/11/17b.html | title = Dartmouth Trustees vote to expand size of board | date = [[2003-11-17]] | work = Dartmouth News | accessdate = 2007-09-09 }}</ref> The alumni trustees are nominated by members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, a body created in 1854 that includes all of Dartmouth's 68,000 living alumni. Names of potential nominees are first proposed by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition, and then alumni cast ballots to determine which one will be their nominee to the Board. In September 2007, the Board announced that it would expand from 18 to 26 by adding eight charter trustee seats.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thedartmouth.com/2007/09/08/news/board/ | title = Board adds 8 seats, ends century-old parity | first = William | last = Schpero | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | date = [[2007-09-08]] | accessdate = 2007-09-09 }}</ref>

Dartmouth is well-known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DC1231F933A15754C0A961948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fD%2fDartmouth%20College | title = 15th President Installed at Dartmouth | first = Matthew L | last = Wald | date = [[1987-07-20]] | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}</ref> The College functions on a [[Academic term|quarter system]], and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as "big weekends"<ref name="steph">{{cite news | oldurl = http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006051902010 | title = Steph's So Dartmouth | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | date = [[2006-05-19]] | first = Stephanie | last = Herbert | accessdate = 2006-10-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~tour/walking/18green.html | publisher = Dartmouth College | title = The Dartmouth Green: A Walking Tour of Dartmouth | accessdate = 2006-10-15 }}</ref> or "party weekends".<ref>{{cite news | oldurl = http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006021004020 | title = Hopkins Center offers many alternatives over weekend | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | date = [[2006-02-10]] | first = Chetan | last = Mehta | accessdate = 2006-10-15 }}</ref> In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class.<ref name="homecoming-history"/> Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports.<ref name="tdr-wc">{{cite news | url = http://dartreview.com/archives/2007/02/11/winter_carnival_stories_of_the_mardi_gras_of_the_north.php | title = Winter Carnival: Stories of the Mardi Gras of the North | date = [[2007-02-11]] | work = [[The Dartmouth Review]] | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref> In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://dartreview.com/archives/2004/05/11/green_key_history_those_were_the_days.php | title = Green Key History: Those Were the Days | date = [[2004-05-11]] | work = [[The Dartmouth Review]] | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref>

The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the [[Connecticut River]]. Begun in 1986, Tubestock met its demise in 2006 when Hanover town ordinances and a lack of coherent student protest conspired to defeat the popular tradition.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://dartreview.com/archives/2007/08/05/town_college_weigh_tubestock_changes.php | title = Town, College Weigh Tubestock Changes | first = Samuel | last = Fisher | work = [[The Dartmouth Review]] | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref> The class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thedartmouth.com/2006/07/27/news/fieldstock/ | title = Fieldstock, chariots await town approval | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | first = Jennifer | last = Garfinkel | date = [[2006-07-26]] | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref>

Another longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run [[Dartmouth Outing Club]] trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the [[Moosilauke Ravine Lodge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~doc/firstyeartrips/about/ | title = About the Program | publisher = Dartmouth Outing Club | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref> In 2006, 85% of freshman elected to participate.

== Insignia and other representations ==
=== Motto and song ===
Dartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is "Vox Clamantis in Deserto". The Latin motto is literally translated as "The voice of one crying in the wilderness",<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829487,00.html | title = Out of the Woods | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = [[1962-11-23]] | accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}</ref><ref name="good"/> but is more often rendered as "A voice crying in the wilderness",<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thedartmouth.com/2007/08/10/news/briefs/ | title = Daily Debriefing | first = Christine | last = Paquin | [[2007-08-10]] | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | accessdate = 2007-09-24 | quote = Usually translated as 'a voice crying in the wilderness,'... }}</ref> which attempts to translate the [[synecdoche]] of the phrase.

=== Seal ===
[[Image:Seal of Dartmouth College.png|thumb|left|Seal of Dartmouth College]]
{{main|Seal of Dartmouth College}}
Dartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a [[Seal (device)|seal]] for use on official documents and diplomas.<ref name="charter"/> The College's founder [[Eleazar Wheelock]] designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]], a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.<ref name="good"/> Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by Commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on [[August 25]], [[1773]], describing it as:

{{cquote|An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words "vox clamantis in deserto" the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.<ref>Dartmouth College, Trustees' Records, 1:26. Dartmouth College Library, Special Collections, DA-1.</ref>}}

On [[October 28]], [[1926]], the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.<ref name="good"/> The College Publications Committee under Ray Nash commissioned typographer W. A. Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from "1770" to "1769," to accord with the date of the College Charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of "1769" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.<ref name="good"/> The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.<ref name="uspatent">{{cite web | url = http://www.uspto.gov/main/trademarks.htm | title = United States Patent and Trademark Office | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>

=== Shield ===
On [[October 28]], [[1926]], the Trustees approved a "Dartmouth College Shield" for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On [[June 9]], [[1944]] the trustees approved another [[coat of arms]] based on the shield part of the seal, this one by [[Canadian]] artist and designer [[Thoreau MacDonald]]. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from "1770" to "1769" around 1958.<ref name="good"/> That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.<ref name="uspatent"/>

College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.<ref>{{cite web | first = Jonathan | last = Good | title = A Proposal for a Heraldic Coat of Arms for Dartmouth College | url = http://faculty.reinhardt.edu/good/dartmouthcoatarms.htm | publisher = Jonathan Good's homepage | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of [[Dartmouth Medical School]], and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as a few nanometers across.<ref>{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Nabity | url = http://www.jcnabity.com/dartseal.htm | publisher = Dartmouth College | title = Nanometer Pattern Generation System: Dartmouth Seal | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> The design has appeared on [[Rudolph Ruzicka]]'s Bicentennial Medal ([[Philadelphia Mint]], 1969) and elsewhere.

=== Nickname, symbol, and mascot ===
[[Image:Keggy the Keg.JPG|thumb|right|Keggy posing on the Dartmouth College Green with [[Baker Memorial Library]] in the background.]]
Dartmouth has never had an official mascot.<ref name="ad-green">{{cite web | url = http://ask.dartmouth.edu/categories/stulife/19.html | title = Is "The Big Green" really Dartmouth's mascot? If so, where does it come from and what does it mean? | work = AskDartmouth | publisher = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref> The nickname "The Big Green," originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green ("Dartmouth Green") as the school's official color in 1866.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ask.dartmouth.edu/categories/misc/22.html | title = Why is green Dartmouth's color? | work = AskDartmouth | publisher = AskDartmouth | publisher = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref> Since the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams have been known by their unofficial nickname "the Indians," a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.<ref name="ad-green"/> This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In the 1974, the Trustees declared the "use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://dartmouthsports.xosn.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=11600&ATCLID=590538 | title = The 'Big Green' Nickname | publisher = DartmouthSports.com | date = [[2007-01-10]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'', have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://dartreview.com/archives/2003/06/08/dartmouth_indians_the_new_tradition.php | title = Dartmouth Indians: The New Tradition | first = Stefan M | last = Beck | date = [[2003-06-08]] | work = [[The Dartmouth Review]] | accessdate = 2007-09-19 }}</ref> but no team has worn the symbol on its uniform in decades.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://dartreview.com/archives/1998/12/15/the_banning_of_the_indian.php | title = The Banning of the Indian | date = [[1998-12-15]] | first = Jeffrey | last = Hart | work = [[The Dartmouth Review]] | accessdate = 2007-09-19 }}</ref>

Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a new mascot, but none has become "official." One proposal devised by the College humor magazine the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' was [[Keggy the Keg]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] beer keg who makes occasional appearances at College sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thedartmouth.com/2007/01/05/arts/straight/ | title = Straight from the Tap: the men behind the mascot | first = Kelsey | Blodget | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | date = [[2007-01-05]] | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}</ref> the mascot has only received approval from the student government.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jacko/keggy/index.htm| title = Keggy the Keg | publisher = [[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]] | date = [[2007-01-10]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the "Dartmoose" as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former Indian mascot.<ref>{{cite news | oldurl = http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2007011001020 | title = First SA meeting draws crowd | first = Allie | last = Lowe | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | date = [[2007-01-10]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>
