"'''The Bus Uncle'''" is a [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] [[video clip]] of an argument between two men aboard a bus in [[Hong Kong]] on [[April 27]], [[2006]]. While the older man, nicknamed the Bus Uncle, scolded the person behind him, a nearby passenger used his camera phone to record the entire incident to provide evidence for the police in the event of a fight.

The video became a cultural sensation in Hong Kong, inspiring vigorous debate and discussion on lifestyle, etiquette, civic awareness and media ethics within the city, eventually attracting the attention of the media around the world.

===Incident===
The video depicts the incident that took place on the upper deck of a [[double decker]]<ref name="CNNrp" /> [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], Route no. 68X<ref name="WP" /> en route to [[Yuen Long]], [[Hong Kong]] at approximately 11:00 p.m. on [[27 April]], [[2006]].<ref name=SCMP1>{{cite news

  | date=[[2006-05-30]] }}</ref> It began when a young bespectacled male passenger tapped the shoulder of a middle-aged man in front of him, asking the man to lower his voice while on the phone. The man in front turned around and reacted strongly<ref name="AP" /> with a rant<ref name="CNNrp" /> about being unnecessarily provoked under stress. The younger man, who seldom talked back, expressed a desire to end the discussion. However, the middle-aged man insisted that the matter was not settled and requested an apology. The younger man apologised, reluctantly shook hands, and also warned the older man regarding the use of [[mother insult]]s.<ref name="WSJ" /> This last warning resulted in more profanities from the older man,<ref name="AP" /> and the video ends with the older man receiving a phone call.<ref name="cry" />

===Title===
The "Bus Uncle" title for the video was coined by members of an Internet forum in reference to the older man in the video. In [[Chinese culture]], it is common to refer an older man as "Uncle" (阿叔), hence the English translation of "The Bus Uncle". The name is also a reference to [[Football (soccer)|football]] commentator [[Lam Sheung Yee]] (林尚義), who is nicknamed "Uncle" and whose voice resembles that of the older man. Lam's name appears as part of the title of the original video.<ref name="original-youtube"/> Contrary to reports in Western media,<ref name="WP">{{cite news

==People involved==

===Bus Uncle===
As the video became well-known, reporters looked for the "Bus Uncle" near the end of the 68X bus route. Eventually, they found the 51-year-old<ref name="cry" /> restaurant worker who resides in [[Yuen Long]], Roger Chan Yuet Tung ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 陳乙東).<ref name ="beaten">{{cite news

===Young man===
The young man scolded in the video is Elvis Ho Yui Hei ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 何銳熙), a 23-year-old<ref name="cry" /> property agent of his family's property management company. On [[May 23]], [[2006]], Ho (previously misidentified as "Alvin" or "Elvin") called a talk show on [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]] claiming to be the young man involved in the argument. In a later interview with the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', Ho said he often takes long bus rides home and would frequently ask passengers to lower their voices so he could take a nap. Despite having been threatened, Ho said he forgave "Bus Uncle" and sympathised with whatever stress the older man was suffering.<ref name=SCMP1/> His patience throughout the ordeal was inspired by [[tai chi chuan]], a slow internal Chinese martial art.<ref name="WSJ" />

===Cameraman===
The person who recorded the video clip was identified as Jon Fong Wing Hang ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 方穎恆), a 21-year-old accountant and part-time psychology student,<ref name="WP" /> after he called a radio station on [[May 25]], [[2006]]. Fong, who recorded the incident with a [[Sony Ericsson]] [[Sony Ericsson W800|W800]]i mobile phone, claimed there was a second video yet to be posted online in which Ho fought back by making fun of "Bus Uncle" with a friend on the phone.  Fong stated that the reason for the recording was to provide evidence to the police in case "Bus Uncle" became physically violent.<ref>{{cite news

==Aftermath==
Chan stated that when Ho tapped him on the shoulder, he was under duress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]] suicide-prevention hotline for support. However, Ho claimed that Chan was just chatting with friends.<ref>{{cite news|title=巴士阿叔痛哭　「我想自殺」 (Bus Uncle sobs, "I want to commit suicide!")|work=[[Next Magazine]]|url = http://next.atnext.com/template/next/sec_main.cfm?iss_id=847&sec_id=1000853|id=Issue No. 847|date=[[2006-05-31]]|accessdate=2007-04-20|language=[[Traditional Chinese]]}}</ref> ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' reported that Chan visited Ho's office on [[May 31]], [[2006]] in [[Mong Kok]] to apologise for the dispute and to initiate a business proposal for the duo to hold a "Bus Uncle Rave Party". Chan was quickly rejected and expelled by Ho, who expressed outrage towards the journalists who arranged the meeting and threatened legal action against the press.<ref>{{cite news|title=「阿叔」何許人也!|work=[[Sing Tao Daily]]|url=http://www.singtao.com/special/unclebus/index.html|accessdate=2007-04-17|language=Cantonese}}</ref> No charges were pressed against Chan himself, although ''[[Ming Pao]]'' opined that his behaviour theoretically contravened the general code of conduct of bus passengers.<ref>{{cite news

<!-- Temporary comment out
On [[June 7]], [[2006]], Chan, who had been hired by a restaurant as a Public Relations officer in the Steak Expert restaurant chain, was physically assaulted on the job in front of horrified diners by three unidentified masked men who then fled the scene.<ref name ="beaten"/> He sustained severe injuries to his eyes and face and was admitted to the emergency department for treatment. The restaurant owner, Mr. Lee, then faced pressure from his wife and daughter to fire Chan due to magazine coverage of Chan's exploits in a [[Shenzhen]] karaoke [[hostess bar]]. Lee's initial refusal led to his wife's suicide attempt through drug overdose on [[June 11]] in order to force the issue. Having learnt of the incident, Chan resigned, saying he did not want Lee's family to be unhappy.<ref>{{cite news|title=「扒后」林珍奇仰藥逼炒巴士阿叔 (The "Steak Queen" attempts suicide through drug overdose to force the dismissal of the Bus Uncle)|work=[[Wen Wei Po]]|url=http://www.wenweipo.com/news.phtml?news_id=HK0606120009&loc=LU&cat=583BS&no_combo=1|accessdate=2007-04-21| language = [[Traditional Chinese]]}}</ref>

===International coverage===
The video clip has English subtitles which, while erroneous in parts, never stray far from the general tenor of the Cantonese version.

The famous quotes of Chan are now frequently used, mimicked, and parodied in Hong Kong, particularly by teenagers. A radio talk show host of Commercial Radio Hong Kong mentioned an incident involving his friend, a teacher, and his students at the end of an examination. When the time was up, a student yelled, "It's not settled! It's not settled! It's not settled!", refusing to stop writing. Only when another teacher replied, "You may be stressed, but so am I," did the student agree to stop.<ref>{{cite episode

In June 2006, TVB television made a parody of the Bus Uncle video in its television promotion for its coverage of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], which featured its sports commentator Lam Sheung Yee (林尚義), whose voice resembles Chan's, on a bus playing the role of the Bus Uncle. In the promotion, a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung Yee (played by Lam Man Chung) questions whether Lam Sheung Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup, which would be his last TV appearance before retirement. Turning around, Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasises that the issue (i.e. the viewers' demand for World Cup coverage) has been resolved.  The passenger then offers to shake hands with Lam Sheung Yee and calls for a truce.<ref>{{cite video

[[Sitcom]]s of [[Asia Television Limited|ATV]] and TVB also imitated the video in argument scenes. In episode 67 of the TVB sitcom ''[[Welcome to the House]]'', the young bespectacled main character tried to stop a man from talking too loudly on the mobile phone in the cinema. As a result, he was harshly rebuked by the man. Once his family knew about the incident from a video uploaded on the internet, they taught the character to be more assertive and not to allow himself to be bullied. In the end, he was able to stand up to the same man when they met again in the cinema and remove him from the premises.<ref>{{cite episode

===A closer look at life in Hong Kong===
Although many found the video humorous and entertaining, others warned that it hints at a more alarming and sinister prognosis of life in stress-filled Hong Kong, particularly inside the buses nicknamed "flying cars of death"<ref name="WSJ" /> and other overcrowded areas. The fact that Chan was runner-up "Person of the Year" announced by [[Radio Television Hong Kong|RTHK]] indicated that it might have struck a chord with the general population.<ref name="Person of the Year">{{cite news

[[To Kit]], a well-known columnist and broadcaster, made a commentary about the incident on Commercial Radio. He described the behavior of Chan as "a noise raping" and said that the incident was the manifestation of underlying social tension as well as the mindset of a common Chinese person. He criticised Elvis' speechlessness as being too weak, likewise a stereotype of present-day Hong Kong youth. In addition, he noted that the incident implied that harmony in the neighborhood was somehow upset.<ref>{{cite episode

Lee Sing, director of the [[Hong Kong Mood Disorders Centre]] at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that Hong Kong's high-stress working environments are spawning a city-full of "Bus Uncles". Lee estimated that one out of every 50 grumpy Hong Kongers suffers from [[intermittent explosive disorder]] (called [[road rage]] elsewhere),<ref name="CNNrp" /> turning one into a "ticking time bomb" of rage and violence.<ref name="explode">{{cite news

Journalism professor and internet expert Anthony Fung Ying-him also attributed the popularity of the low-resolution video of a "trivial event" to the emotional climate of the city.<ref name="explode" /> While other viral videos are favoured by specific demographics, this one spread widely due to its universal<ref name="alongfor" /> expression of "the true feelings of ordinary people."<ref name="CNNrp" />

On the other hand, Ho Kwok Leung, an applied social science lecturer at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], held that the attention surrounding the video reflects the boring lives led by Hong Kong people. With few interesting topics to discuss, they get to savour the pleasures of spreading information to a vast audience and the creation of internet memes. Furthermore, the banning of the usage of some video catchphrases in certain schools made the incident more appealing. This lifestyle, according to Leung, is fertile ground for the cultivation of a "video clip culture".<ref>{{cite news

=== Civic awareness concerns ===
[[w:zh:阿濃|Ah Nong]] (阿濃), a Chinese literary figure, stated the incident highlighted the apathy of Hong Kong people. He emphasised that during the heated exchange between the Chan and Ho, not a single bystander came to Ho's aid. He recalled an incident a few years back where he confronted a man smoking on the lower deck of a bus and was scolded for the rest of the journey. He said it was useless to complain to the bus driver who would not bother to waste his time, let alone the other passengers. Ah Nong argued that in such a society, a person can be accused of wrongdoing despite good intentions.<ref>{{cite news

Apple Tse Ho Yi, minister of the Hong Kong Christian Service, carried out a survey of 506 students over the age of 12 about the Bus Uncle incident and civic awareness in general. Of the respondents who claim they regularly encountered people speaking loudly on the phone on buses, only 47 percent said they would intervene by talking to the phone user or alerting the driver. Reasons for inaction include fear, apathy and inability to solve the problem. On civic awareness, the majority of the respondants did not consider chatting loudly on the phone to be wrong. Tse concluded that the current generation of Hong Kong young people have poor civic awareness, and it is natural that disputes often occur due to inconsideration.<ref name="survey">{{cite news

Ng Fung Sheung, a social science lecturer of the [[City University of Hong Kong]], explained that Hong Kong people tend to chat loudly in public places. She attributed this phenomenon to the television screens found in many vehicles and trains, which broadcast programmes at high volumes. She suggested that the government should provide better civic education for the public to make them more considerate of others. When it comes to schools which banned the usage of catch phrases like "I'm stressed!" Ng stated that teachers must be able to distinguish whether the students really face pressure or are simply following the trend, and provide guidance if necessary.<ref>{{cite news

===Criticism of Hong Kong media ethics===
Some denied that any social insight could be gleamed from the video clip, arguing that the frenzy was artificially created by sensationalist newspapers in order to boost circulation and profits. Clement So York-kee, Director of the [[Journalism school|School of Journalism]] at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that methods to uncover the incident between Chan and Ho "did not seem to...[involve the] traditional practice of news reporting."<ref name=alongfor>{{cite news
  | last = Lam

  | title = Along for the ride
  | work = [[South China Morning Post]]
  | date=[[2006-06-03]] }}</ref> For example, several media outlets offered rewards on unmasking Bus Uncle's identity. In late May 2006, a group of journalists and photographers initiated and followed Chan's second meeting with Ho. After Ho's refusal, they brought Bus Uncle to a dinner and karaoke session.<ref name="MM" /> Although the session was widely reported, many believed it was artificially created news and unworthy of front-page attention.<ref>{{cite news

''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' stated that the Bus Uncle incident put the professionalism of the Hong Kong mass media to the test, its editorial noting in addition to Roger Chan seeking renumeration for interviews, he made many extraordinary claims about his life which were published without verification. The editorial concluded by advising journalists not to fabricate news, instead they should place emphasis on the verifiability of their stories and think carefully whether an incident is worth reporting.<ref>{{cite news
