'''Munster''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''An Mhumhain'', {{IPA2|ənˈvuːnʲ}}) is the southernmost of the four [[provinces of Ireland]]. It comprises the counties of [[County Clare|Clare]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] and [[County Waterford|Waterford]].) The largest city in Munster is [[Cork (city)|Cork]].

The name is derived from the Celtic goddess, [[Muma]]. The province was once divided into six regions: Tuadh Mhuman (north Munster), Deas Mhuman (south Munster), Urh Mumhan (east Munster), Iar mumhan (west Munster), Ernaibh Muman (the Ernai tribe's portion of Munster), and Deisi Muman (the Deisi tribe's portion of Munster). Ultimately, these were all subsumed into the kingdoms of [[Thomond]] (north), [[County Desmond|Desmond]] (south), and [[Ormond (ancient Irish kingdom)|Ormond]] (east), all of which were eventually subsumed by surrender and regrant as Earldoms in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. The names exist only indirectly today, particularly in the case of [[Thomond]]. The three [[crown (headgear)|crowns]] represent these three kingdoms.  This flag can easily be confused with the flag of [[Dublin]] which has three [[castle]]s in a similar pattern on a blue background; it also resembles the lesser [[coat-of-arms]] of [[Sweden]].

In 1841 before the Great Famine, there was just under 3 million people living in the province of Munster, but the population had dropped devastatingly low due to mass emigration in the 1840's and continued emigration up until the 1980's.

For 30 days during the [[Irish Civil War]], the province of Munster broke away from the Irish Free State and established the [[Munster Republic]] in opposition to the acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The Munster Republic was short lived and subsequently crushed by heavily-armed [[Irish Free State]] forces.

[[Munster Rugby|Munster]] is also an [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] representative side which competes in the [[Celtic League (Rugby Union)|Celtic League]] and for the [[Heineken Cup]], winning in 2006.

==Irish Language==

The [[Irish language]] is allegedly spoken as a first language in [[Gaeltachtaí]] (Irish speaking areas);

* in West Kerry (''Corce Dhuibhne'')
* in South Kerry (''Uíbh Ráthach''). Here, the language died out in the 1950's.
* in West Cork (''Múscraí'')
* in south-west Cork (''Oileán Cléire'')
* in south-west Waterford (''Gaeltacht na Rinne'' or ''Gaeltacht na nDeise'')

Within the past thirty years, there has been a big increase in the amount of [[Gaelscoileanna]] (Irish language schools) outside of the [[Gaeltachtaí]]. Children learn Irish, and leave Irish, in the Gaelscoileanna. Despite being in vogue for over 30 years, these schools have failed to halt the decline of Gaelic.
