{{Nihongo|'''''Suzuka'''''|涼風}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] [[mangaka|authored]] by [[Kouji Seo]]. The series is a character-driven romance story that uses the athletics of [[Athletics (track and field)|track and field]] as a subplot. The story primarily follows the life of the teenager Yamato Akitsuki, who moved to Tokyo to change himself, and his main love interest Suzuka Asahina, a talented and highly [[Scout (sport)|scouted]] high jumper who lives in Yamato's aunt's dormitory and attends his new high school.

''Suzuka'' was serialized in the Japanese magazine ''[[Weekly Shonen Magazine]]'' published by [[Kodansha]]. It was adapted into a twenty-six episode [[anime]] series and aired on [[TV Tokyo]] in Japan between [[6 July]] [[2005]] and [[28 December]] [[2005]]. Both versions of the series have been licensed for release in [[North America]] by two different companies. The manga has been licensed for publication by [[Del Rey Manga]] under their mature line. The anime series has been licensed and is being released by [[FUNimation Entertainment]].

==Plot==
The plot is based on a young man, Yamato Akitsuki, who moves from his rural home in [[Hiroshima Prefecture]] to live at his aunt's apartment building and [[sentō|indoor bath]] complex in [[Tokyo]] and attend the local athletics-oriented [[high school]]. Before arriving at his new home, he walks past his new school and sees a young girl practicing [[high jump]] at the track field. 

He falls in love with her at first sight but does not expect to see her again. He soon discovers that the girl, Suzuka Asahina, is one of the occupants of his aunt's apartment and that they happen to live next door to each other. To pursue Suzuka, Yamato joins the [[Athletics (track and field)|track and field]] team in hopes of impressing her. After joining the team, he discovers that he has the potential to become a top hundred-meter [[Sprint (race)|sprinter]]. The story intertwines his pursuit of love and athletics. 

Suzuka's character-driven plot predominantly makes use of [[dramatic structure]] to facilitate character development. [[Characterization]] is further achieved through the use of character [[back-story]]. The story in general employs a [[Verisimilitude (literature)|realistic]] [[Tone (fiction)|tone]], but will occasionally use [[surreal humour]]. Some events covered in the story are: track competitions, vacations, [[Japanese Cultural Festival|culture festivals]], and outings to a [[Karaoke Box]] and a [[theme park]]. The manga and anime follow the same storyline, though there are minor differences. One of these changes is that the nude scenes are less graphic in the anime than the manga. Another disparity is the hair color of some of the characters such as the character Miki, who is depicted as having bright red hair on the covers of the manga, but is portrayed with brown hair in the anime.

;{{nihongo|Suzuka Asahina|朝比奈 涼風|Asahina Suzuka}} 
{{anime voices|Kanako Mitsuhashi|Leah Clark}}
: The female lead of the series and the [[Romantic interest (theater)|love interest]] of Yamato. She moved from her home in [[Yokohama]] to Tokyo to take up an offer of one of the various high schools that were scouting for her talent in the [[high jump]]. She takes her athletics very seriously and puts pressure on herself because she does not want to disappoint others. Early in the series, her feelings are guarded because of a tragic event from her past. This character was named after the World War II [[Japanese destroyer Suzukaze]].<!-- Suzukaze and Suzuka use the same kanji "涼風" and the pronunciation is contextual depending on usage--><ref name="databook1">{{cite book| last =Seo | first =Kouji| authorlink =| title =ibid | publisher =| language =| isbn =| date =2005-09-16| pages =}}</ref>

;{{nihongo|Honoka Sakurai|桜井 萌果|Sakurai Honoka}} 
{{anime voices|Yumiko Hosono|Brina Palencia}}
: She first met Yamato when they were younger at her family's [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] that he liked to visit when he was at his aunt's home. During their first meeting, Yamoto helped her out by doing a makeshift repair to the shrine bell that had fallen down. After this incident, she had developed a [[Sexual attraction|crush]] on him, but was too shy to talk to him. Much to her shock, Yamato enrolled to her high school and was placed in her class. Seeing her opportunity, she overcomes her shyness and begins to talk with him.

;{{nihongo|Yasunobu Hattori|服部 安信|Hattori Yasunobu}} 
{{anime voices|Takanori Ohyama|Robert McCollum}} 
: He first met Yamato when he was lost in Tokyo as a child and could not find his way back to his aunt's dormitory. After Yasunobu guided him back, they became friends, even though some of Yasunobu's antics got Yamato into trouble. He has grown up to be a [[Promiscuity|ladies' man]] and often goes on [[Dating (activity)|dates]] with different girls. He dreams of [[polygyny]]<!--one man with many wifes--> being legalized in Japan. Yamato often comes to him for relationship advice, which he gives, but somehow Yamato blunders his ideas.

;{{nihongo|Miki Hashiba|羽柴 美紀|Hashiba Miki}}
{{anime voices|Seika Hosokawa|Jamie Marchi}}
: She is a sprinter for the track team and is Suzuka's best friend. When she first met Suzuka at the middle school track competitions, Miki did not like her because she felt that she was conceited. It was not until Miki comprehended the pressure Suzuka put on herself did they become friends. Miki later on also becomes friends with Yamato. Since she is a mutual friend to both, she is in the unique position to help them understand each other or to call them out when she thinks one of them has treated the other unjustly. She seems to dislike Yasunobu's playboy personality; because of this, she often gets into disagreements with him.

==Reception==
===Manga===
''Suzuka'' has been compared to other manga such as ''[[Love Hina]]'',<ref name="Delnew" /> ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'',<ref name="unwound">{{cite web |last = Garcia|first = Michael|title = Episode 307: Beware of Suzuka| publisher = Unwound|date = [[2006]]-[[12-23]]|url = http://www.unwoundshow.com/?p=87|accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref> and ''[[Kimagure Orange Road]]''<ref name="film">{{cite web | author = The Smug Dude | title = New Anime, Suzuka | url = http://www.film.com/dvds/story/newanimesuzuka/15114295| publisher =Film.com| date = [[2007]]-[[06-14]]| accessdate = 2007-07-17}} </ref> since, early on, it used similar [[Plot (narrative)|plot structure]] and [[plot device]]s. These comparisons have become less frequent as the story became more developed. According to Kouji Seo, ''Suzuka'' was to be a romance story from the beginning, and he had no intention of creating a [[Harem (genre)|harem]] manga.<ref> {{cite book| last =Seo | first =Kouji| authorlink =| title =Weekly Shonen Magazine Suzuka Official Guide Book Yu Kemuri Renai Hakushu | publisher =Kodansha| language =Japanese | isbn =4-06-372073-X| date =2005-09-16| pages =pp. 171}}</ref> Since ''Suzuka'' primarily focuses on character development through the use of many different plot devices, it becomes hard to classify.<ref name="comsn12"> {{cite web | first =Matt | last = Blind | title = Review: Suzuka, Vols. 1 & 2| url = http://comicsnob.com/2007/01/23/review-suzuka-vols-1-2/| publisher = Comicsnob.com| date = [[2007]]-[[01-23]]| accessdate =2007-07-18 }} </ref> Like other manga, ''Suzuka'' contains [[fan service]] which is less frequent than other series, but is more graphic.<ref name="TJ">{{Cite web | author = Hayate| title = Suzuka Manga Impressions | url = http://www.tokidokijournal.com/article.php?id=586| publisher = Tokidoki Journal| date = [[2006]]-[[09-27]]| accessdate = 2007-07-19}}</ref> Since the North American version is uncensored, this caused the manga to be rated "Mature" and sold in [[shrink wrap]].<ref>{{cite news | first = Kai-Ming| last = Cha| title = Del Rey Manga Grows Up| url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6308894.html| publisher = Publishers Weekly| date =[[2006]]-[[02-21]]| accessdate = 2007-07-19}}</ref> Kouji Seo's artwork is considered to be above average, but rather generic. He does make use of a variety of perspectives that is comparable to the different types of [[Shot (film)|shots]] in film as well as his characters are often shown wearing different changes of clothing throughout the manga.<ref name="comsn12" /> Kouji Seo also pays attention to detail which can be seen in the clothing that gives off the sensation they are made out of different material along with the reflections in the windows during the nighttime.<ref> {{cite web | first = Matthew| last =Alexander | title =Suzuka Vol. #01 of 15* | url =http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/manga/manga.php?manga_view=2200| publisher =Anime on DVD| date = [[2006]]-[[08-30]]| accessdate =2007-07-24 }} </ref> This detail can also be seen in his characters as they all have complex personalities that make them interesting and have substance.<ref name="comicbookbin"> {{cite web | first =Julie | last = Gray | title =Suzuka Volume One | url =http://www.comicbookbin.com/Suzuka_Volume_One587.html | publisher =the comic book bin | date = [[2006]]-[[11-28]]| accessdate =2007-07-23 }} </ref> Overall the reception of the manga has been positive.

===Anime===
The anime has been described as having "all the trappings of a standard high school romantic comedy",<ref name="animeondvd">{{cite web| last =Beveridge| first =Chris| title =Suzuka Vol. #1 Review| publisher =Anime on DVD |date =[[2007]]-[[06-14]]| url =http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/6287.php| accessdate =2007-06-24 }}</ref> but lacks the spirit and craftsmanship of the manga.<ref name="ANNreview">{{cite web| last =Santos| first =Carlo| title =Suzuka DVD 1 Review| publisher =Anime News Network| date =[[2007]]-[[06-22]]| url =http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/suzuka/dvd-1| accessdate =2007-06-24 }}</ref> Since the anime is a close adaptation from the manga, the criticisms of the plot are the same of it being described as generic. The anime sells "...themselves solely on the merits of character development".<ref name="film" /> One effect of this character development is that some viewers will find the [[Title role|title character]] and the male lead unlikable.<ref name="dvdt2">{{cite web | first = John| last =Sinnott | title = Suzuka v.1 | url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=28684 |publisher =DVD talk| date = [[2007]]-[[06-18]]| accessdate = 2007-07-25}} </ref><ref name="ANN DVD 5">{{cite web|last =Kimlinger|first =Carl|

===Music===
The response to the soundtrack for the anime is somewhat mixed. Most find the music respectable, but some may detest it when it tries to be funny.<ref name="ANNreview" /> The opening and ending songs that were re-written and performed in English made the songs fairly close approximations of the originals and worked out better than one might imagine,<ref name="ANNreview" /> but others still prefer the Japanese versions.<ref name="dvdt2" />
