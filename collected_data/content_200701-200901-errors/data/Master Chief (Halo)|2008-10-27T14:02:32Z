'''Master Chief Petty Officer John-117''', commonly called the '''Master Chief''', is a [[fictional character]] and the main [[protagonist]] of the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' [[Fictional universe|universe]], created by [[Bungie Studios]], and is a [[player character]] in the trilogy of science fiction [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]]s ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'',  ''[[Halo 2]]'', and ''[[Halo 3]]''. Outside of video games, the Master Chief appears in the novels ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', and has cameos in ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'' and the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]''. He is voiced by Chicago [[disc jockey]] [[Steve Downes]] in the video games in which he appears.

The Master Chief is one of the most visible symbols of the ''Halo'' series and the video game universe. Originally designed by Marcus Lehto, Rob McLees, and Shi Kai Wang, the character is a towering and faceless [[cybernetics|cybernetically]] [[SPARTAN Project|enhanced supersoldier]]; he is never seen without his green-colored armor or helmet. Steve Downes built his personification of the Chief off a character description which called for a [[Clint Eastwood]]-type character of few words.

The Master Chief has been called an icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as [[Mario]], [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and [[Lara Croft]].<ref name="businessweek">{{cite web|last=Snow|first=Blake|date=2007-08-03|url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2007/id2007083_351181.htm|title=Game Icons We Love|work=[[Business Week]]|accessdate=2007-10-08|quote=Microsoft's Master Chief, perhaps the newest franchise character on the block, is no different.}}</ref> While a widely known figure, the Master Chief has received mixed reception. Reviewers such as [[Kotaku]] have pointed to the Chief's silent and faceless nature as a weakness to the character, while other publications have stated that this attribute allows players to better assume the role of the Master Chief.<!--UNSOURCED-PLEASE SOURCE BEFORE READDING TO LEAD PARAGRAPH''Gaming magazine [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' named the Master Chief as the eighth greatest video game character ever.-->

==Character design==
[[Image:Masterchief sheik.png|thumb|upright|Shi Kai Wang's sketch of Master Chief]]
The task of developing the Master Chief for the character's first appearance in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' fell on Rob McLees and the project's Art Director, Marcus Lehto. Eventually, Shi Kai Wang was hired for conceptual art.<ref name="aoh20">{{cite book|last=Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year=2004|publisher=Del Ray Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-345-47586-0}}</ref> One of Wang's sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief; however, after Wang's version was converted to a 3-D model, it was decided the character looked too slender, "almost effeminate".<ref name=aoh20/> The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games.<ref name=aoh20/> Similarly, the Chief's armor went through various changes, such as the addition of an antenna, which was removed later in development, and a green tint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904|title=One Million Years B.X.|date=2006-02-10 |publisher=[[Bungi.net]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904|publisher=Bungie Studios|archivedate=2006-02-10}}</ref>

In an interview on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's [[Joseph Staten]] noted that, "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," he said, "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space Marine in really cool green armor."<ref>{{cite web|author=Cifaldi, Frank|date=2005-05-26|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050526/cifaldi_01.shtml|title=E3 Report: Developing Better Characters, Better Stories|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

==Attributes==
===Personality===
Steve Downes said that his voice acting was based entirely on Bungie's written character description provided, which specified a character similar to [[Clint Eastwood]] and of few words. In a [[podcast]] interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, he was given a fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality.<ref name="interview1"/> In the games, the Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him an almost silent protagonist. Even during cutscenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [and] apply their own personality."<ref name="frank">{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813227p2.html|title=IGN interview with Frankie O'connor|accessdate=2007-09-02|last=Kolan|first=Patrick|date=2006-09-02|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described the Master Chief as "pretty much the consummate professional.

Entirely encased in heavy armor and standing seven feet tall, the Chief inspires awe and terror in friends and foes alike.<ref name="Dietz">{{cite book |last=Dietz|first=William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year=2003|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-345-45921-0}}</ref> Despite his cold exterior, Master Chief cares about his fellow soldiers, especially the Spartan-IIs with whom he has trained.<ref name="Dietz"/> At one point, the Master Chief risks injury in a massive explosion to save a fellow Spartan,<ref name="Nylund2003">{{cite book|last=Nylund|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Nylund|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year=2003|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-345-46781-7}}</ref> and withholds some combat information on the threat of the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], an alien parasite, after realizing that the full disclosure of the combat data would mean the death of [[Sergeant Major A.J. Johnson|Sergeant Avery Johnson]].<ref name="Nylund2003"/>

During his training, the Master Chief is taught by [[Chief Petty Officer]] [[List of Halo characters#Franklin Mendez|Franklin Mendez]] to sacrifice lives only when necessary and to understand the difference between "wasting lives and spending lives."<ref name="Nylund2001">{{cite book|last=Nylund|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Nylund|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year=2001|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-345-45132-5}}</ref> While in the Chi Ceti system, one of the Master Chief's fellow Spartans and best friend, Samuel-034, suffers an irreparable breach in his armor.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> Sam stays behind to detonate explosives, while the Master Chief and Kelly evacuate the ship. Although the Chief would have preferred to die with his friend, he tells himself that he needs to "live and fight another day".<ref name="Nylund2001"/> In ''Halo: First Strike'', [[List of Halo characters#Catherine Halsey|Dr. Catherine Halsey]] tries to teach him to save every single life possible.<ref name="Nylund2001"/>

Despite the Master Chief's excellent combat record, many in the [[United Nations Space Command]] (UNSC), the military unit to which he belongs, distrust him. [[Characters in the Halo series#Antonio Silva|Antonio Silva]], an [[United Nations Space Command#Orbital Drop Shock Troopers|Orbital Drop Shock Trooper]], exemplifies this attitude,<ref name="Nylund2003"/> and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet.<ref name="Dietz"/> Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor said in an interview that revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.<ref name="frank"/>

===Outward appearance===
In the video games, the Master Chief is never seen without his armor. In the final cutscene of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief removes his helmet, but camera movement hides his face. The first cutscene in ''Halo 2'' similarly pans up the Chief's body to his head just as he puts on his helmet. Bungie did this to help the player bond with the Chief.<ref name="time">{{cite web|last=Grossman|first=Lev|date=2007-08-30|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1657825,00.html|title=The Man in the Mask|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> The only physical description of the Master Chief comes from the novels. During a briefing scene in ''Halo: The Flood'', the Chief is described as tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features. His skin is "too white", a consequence of spending most of his time in his armor.<ref name="Dietz"/> The Master Chief stands about seven&nbsp;feet (2.13&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 1,000 pounds (450&nbsp;kg) in armor;<ref>{{cite book|year=2004 |author=Bungie Studios|title=''Halo 2'' Instruction Manual|pages=8|publisher=Microsoft Game Studios}}</ref> without it, he stands six&nbsp;feet, seven&nbsp;inches (2&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 287&nbsp;pounds (130&nbsp;kg).<ref name="Nylund2001"/><ref>Mark MacDonald, "Spartan Specs: Under the Chief's hood," ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 225 (February 2008): 26-27.</ref>

===''Halo: The Fall of Reach''===
{{seealso|Halo: The Fall of Reach}}
The Master Chief's backstory is never explained in the games. A prequel of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the 2001 novel ''The Fall of Reach'', reveals much of the character's history and was released as a companion to the game. The Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus II. Large for his six years of age, and approximately a foot above his school peers, he is described as a typical boy with brown hair, freckles and a gap between his two front teeth.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with [[United Nations Space Command#Flash clones|flash clones]] to hide the kidnapping. The original children are brought to planet [[Reach (Halo)|Reach]], one of the UNSC's headquarters, to begin intense physical and psychological training to become [[SPARTAN-II Project|SPARTAN-II]] supersoldiers.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> They are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names; John becomes known as John-117. Approximately eight years later, John and the other children are biologically and cybernetically augmented and enhanced. These procedures had substantial risks;<ref name="Nylund2001"/> only John and thirty-two other Spartans survive.<ref name="Nylund2001"/>. 

After the Spartans' first successful operation which involved capturing a rogue UNSC officer, John-117 is briefed on the threat posed by the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> The Spartans are first sent to the Damascus Materials Testing Facility on the planet Chi Ceti 4 to retrieve the [[MJOLNIR battle armor|MJOLNIR Mark IV armor]]. In the process, they board a Covenant vessel and plant a bomb; John is forced to leave one of his fellow Spartans, his best friend, to die.<ref name="Nylund2001"/>

In 2552, the Covenant invades the human world of Sigma Octanus and occupies one of its cities, Cote D'Azure.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> Following a failed Marine assault, John-117 and three teams of Spartans are sent to destroy the Covenant force with a nuclear warhead. After detonating the weapon, the Spartans return to [[Halo universe#Reach|Reach]], where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant [[Covenant (Halo)#Prophets|High Prophet]], who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) [[Cortana]] during a training mission.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> A massive Covenant armada of 314 ships<ref>{{cite video game|title=Halo 2|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|year=2004 |platform=Xbox|level=Cairo Station|quote='''Cortana''': Fifteen Covenant capital ships, holding position just outside the killzone. / '''Lord Hood''': Something's not right.

===''Halo: Combat Evolved''===
{{see also|Halo: Combat Evolved|Halo: The Flood}}
The Master Chief first appears in the games as the protagonist of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. In ''Halo: The Flood'', the 2003 novelization of the video game, the Chief is likewise the main character. During the opening cinematic of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting [[slipspace]], the ''[[Pillar of Autumn]]'' is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]], a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via escape pod. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, the Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]], as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called the Flood.<ref name="bigblow">{{cite video game|title=Halo: Combat Evolved|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|year=2001 |platform=Xbox|level=Two Betrayals|quote='''Cortana''': You have no idea how this ring works, do you?

{{see also|Halo: First Strike}}
''Halo: First Strike'', the 2003 novel by [[Eric Nylund]], follows the Master Chief after the events of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and bridges the events of ''Halo'' and ''Halo 2''. Floating in Halo's debris field, Cortana and the Chief discover that there are in fact other human survivors.<ref name="Nylund2003"/> The Master Chief and these soldiers capture the Covenant flagship ''Ascendant Justice'', and return to Reach to save any UNSC survivors on the planet. At Reach, the Master Chief discovers that the Covenant had not destroyed the planet's [[biosphere]] in the usual manner, and that a few other Spartans survive. The Chief retrieves [[Characters in the Halo series#Catherine Halsey|Dr. Catherine Halsey]], the creative genius behind the SPARTAN-II Project, and his fellow soldiers. The Spartans then attack a massive Covenant command station, the ''Unyielding Hierophant'', thus delaying a Covenant assault on Earth.<ref name="Nylund2003"/>

===''Halo 2''===
{{see also|Halo 2}}
[[Image:Masterchief halo2 delta.png|thumb|The Master Chief lands on the surface of [[Delta Halo]].]]
The Master Chief returns as one of two playable characters in ''Halo 2'', the 2004 sequel to ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. Returning to Earth with heavily damaged armor, the Master Chief receives an upgrade. Aboard Cairo Station in space, he attends a brief awards ceremony, which is interrupted by a Covenant invasion. Master Chief is commanded to protect the station.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Halo 2|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|year=2004 |platform=Xbox|level=Cairo Station|quote='''Lord Hood''': They're going to try to take our MAC guns offline, give their capital ships a straight shot at Earth. Master Chief... defend this station.}}</ref> The Covenant is repelled, and the Master Chief joins the ship ''[[In Amber Clad]]'' to fight the Covenant on Earth's surface, in New Mombasa. As the Covenant departs via [[Slipstream (science fiction)|slipspace]], the ''In Amber Clad'' follows them to [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 05|Installation 05]], another Halo. The Master Chief lands on this Halo and subsequently [[assassination|assassinates]] the Covenant [[Hierarchs (Halo)|High Prophet]] of Regret. Emerging from a structure, the Master Chief is attacked by orbiting Covenant forces, but is rescued by the [[Gravemind]], an intelligence of Flood origin. The Gravemind sends him to [[High Charity]] to search for Delta Halo's Index.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Halo 2|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|year=2004 |platform=Xbox|level=Gravemind|quote='''Gravemind''': If you will not hear the truth, then I will show it to you.

===''Halo: Uprising'' and ''Halo 3''===
{{see also|Halo: Uprising|Halo 3}}
The Master Chief appears as a main character in Marvel's [[limited series]] ''Halo: Uprising'', in which he breaks into a Covenant-held Forerunner structure before being captured by the Covenant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bendis|first=Brian Michael|title=[[Halo: Uprising]], Book 1|year=2007|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|location=New York}}</ref> Like ''First Strike'', the comic serves as a bridge between two video games, ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'', in which Master Chief is again the main character.

Back on Earth, the Master Chief helps to repel hostile Covenant forces from [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Voi]]. With the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] (a [[Covenant Elite]] who has sided with humanity) and fellow allies, the Chief leads the assault on a Forerunner artifact that the Covenant [[Hierarchs (Halo)#High Prophet of Truth|Prophet of Truth]] is attempting to activate. Soon after Truth escapes Earth through the slipspace portal opened by the artifact, the Flood lands on Earth.<ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 3]] |developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |year=2007 |platform=[[Xbox 360]] |version= |level=Floodgate  |quote='''Arbiter''': What is it?

The Flood follow the Chief to the Ark, bringing ''High Charity'' through the slipspace portal to escape the range of the six original Halos. The allied Elites and humans decide to activate the ''new'' Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve life there. 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it. The Master Chief destroys him, activates the ring, and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate ''Forward Unto Dawn''. During the escape, the collapsing slipspace portal severs the ''Dawn'' in two, stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space. While the Arbiter returns to Earth, Cortana activates a distress beacon, knowing that rescue could take years; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana, "Wake me when you need me."<ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 3]] |developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |year=2007 |platform=[[Xbox 360]] |version= |level=Halo  |quote='''Cortana''': I'll miss you. / '''Master Chief''': Wake me.

The Master Chief has appeared or has been referenced several times in non-canon media. [[Team Ninja]] approached Bungie Studios and asked to use the Master Chief in their 2006 video game ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]''.

In an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[Lev Grossman]] stated that the Master Chief represents a "new kind of celebrity for a new and profoundly weird millennium" and is a symbol of the increasing legitimacy of video games as an art form.<ref name="time"/> ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' simply described the Chief as "iconic".<ref>{{cite news|author=Moses, Asher|date=2007-08-30|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/prepare-for-allout-war/2007/08/30/1188067256196.html|title=Prepare for an All-Out War|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' noted that the Master Chief had become the ''[[de facto]]'' symbol for the [[Xbox]] and for a new generation of gamers to boot.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] staff|date=2005-11-28|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3145545&did=1|title=Top Ten Video Game Characters|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> The recognition of the Master Chief has spread to mainstream culture; [[Madame Tussauds]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] has developed a wax sculpture of the Chief. At the ceremony, [[Pete Wentz]] of [[Fall Out Boy]] said that the "Master Chief is as much of a hero today as characters like [[Spider-Man]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and [[Luke Skywalker]] were for previous generations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/h/halo3/articles/20070910-madametussaud.htm|title=Master Chief Invades Madame Tussauds|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=2007-09-10|accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref> Steve Downes only realized his character was such a huge hit after children lined up around the block for his autograph about a year after the game shipped.<ref name="gameinformer-downes/dadabo"/>

''[[BusinessWeek]]'' listed the Master Chief among several video game characters who have been branded beyond their respective video games, "helping them transcend the very medium in the process".<ref name="businessweek"/> The Master Chief has been used in marketing on a variety of products, from [[7-Eleven]] [[Slurpee]]s to T-shirts, [[Xbox 360]] controllers, and [[Mountain Dew]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brudvig|first=Erik|date=2007-07-31|url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/809/809612p1.html |title=Halo 3 Box Arrives at IGN Offices|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.xbox360rally.com/reserve-halo-3-at-7-11-today/|title=Reserve Halo 3 at 7-11 TODAY!|accessdate=2007-08-22|date=2007-08-06|publisher=Xbox360Rally}}</ref> In Australia, around September 2007, Hoyts Cinemas popcorn buckets were branded with high-detail images of Halo 3 and the Master Chief along with a prize advertising offer. Several [[action figure]]s of the character have been created to market of the ''Halo'' series; the most recent were manufactured by McFarlane.<ref>{{cite web|author=Plunkett, Luke|date=2007-09-12|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/gallery/mcfarlane-halo-3-figures-298838.php|title=McFarlane Halo 3 figures|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> These actions have been called necessary to the game franchise; Ed Ventura, director of Xbox's worldwide marketing, said, "We want to be in the hearts and minds of our fans as much as we can."<ref>{{cite web|last=High|first=Kamau|date=2004-12-09|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/53d070a6-4987-11d9-8ce9-00000e2511c8.html|title=Play the game, buy the licensed consumer goods|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>

Roger Travis, associate professor of classics at the [[University of Connecticut]], compared the Master Chief to the epic hero [[Aeneas]], in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting. The audience is intended to become immersed and to identify with the protagonist similarly in both stories.<ref>{{cite web|last=Travis|first=Roger|date=[[October 10]], [[2006]]|title=Bungie's Epic Achievement: Halo and the Aeneid|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_66/384-Bungie-s-Epic-Achievement|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> [[Matthew Stover]]  compared ''Halo'' to the ''[[Iliad]]'', saying that both stories share the meta-theme that "war is the crucible of character". As [[military science fiction]], ''Halo'' further raises the issue of being human.<ref name="Stover">{{cite book|last=Stover|first=Matthew Woodring|authorlink=Matthew Stover|chapter=You Are the Master Chief|title=Halo Effect: An Unauthorized Look at the Most Successful Video Game of All Time|editor=Yeffeth, Glenn (ed.)|publisher=[[BenBella Books]]|location=[[Dallas, Texas]]|year=2006|pages=1–10}}</ref> Stover argued that, since players are to imagine themselves as the Master Chief, the character is correctly presented as a [[cyborg]], neither a flawless machine nor fully human. Players would be unable to empathize with the former, and the latter would be too specifically developed.<ref name="Stover"/>

[[IGN]] saw in the Master Chief elements of Jon 6725416, a character in [[Christopher Rowley]]'s novel ''Starhammer''.<ref name="Perry">{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Douglass|date=2006-05-16|url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/709/709122p1.html|title=The Influence of Literature and Myth in Videogames|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> Reviewers have suggested that the name John-117 could be a Biblical reference.<ref name="Park"/><ref name="Perry"/>

Reaction to the Master Chief as a character is generally mixed. Some reviewers see the character's silent nature as a strength;<ref name="Park"/> others have said that this quality leaves him insufficiently developed and believable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bear|first=Erik|date=2004-12-16|url=http://www.sfhomeworld.org/make_contact/article.asp?articleID=164|title=''Halo 2'' vs ''Half Life 2''|publisher=SF HomeWorld|accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=2007-09-24|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/feature/halo-3-review-300345.php|title=Feature: ''Halo 3'' Review|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref> Neil Blomkamp, director of the stalled [[Halo (film)|''Halo'' film]], said the movie  would have depicted the character as "the most important supporting cast member" because of his faceless nature. Instead, "other characters around him [...] did most of the emotional heavy lifting", with their story exploring their perception of the Chief.<ref>{{cite news|last=Croal|first=N'Gai|title=Exclusive: And The Winner For Best Supporting Actor Is...As Master Chief?
