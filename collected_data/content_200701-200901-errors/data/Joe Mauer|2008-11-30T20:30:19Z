'''Joseph Patrick Mauer''' ({{pronEng|ˈmaʊɚ}}) (born April 19, 1983 in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[catcher]] for the [[Minnesota Twins]].

Mauer is considered by many scouts to be the best young catcher in the sport and has been said by some, including Hall of Famer [[Cal Ripken Jr.]], to have the best swing in baseball.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/features/mauer_gallery/mauer_gallery_index.html?lpos=spotlight&lid=tab2pos2 | title=A Swing Of Beauty | publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref><ref name="joe">{{cite web | url=http://www.athomeplate.com/spotlightmauer.shtml | title=Player in the Spotlight: Joe Mauer | author=Daniel Paulling | date=2004-07-12 | publisher=AtHomePlate.com}}</ref> In his breakout 2006 season, Mauer became the first catcher in major league history to lead both leagues in batting average and the first [[American League]] catcher to win the [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting title]], finishing with an [[Batting average|average]] of .347.<ref name="ba">{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2609825 | title=Mauer wins AL batting title on final day | date=2006-10-01 | publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> He is also the first American League catcher to win a batting title twice.

Mauer also had an extremely accomplished high school football career. During his senior season as the Raiders' quarterback, Mauer completed 241 of 288 passes for 3,022 yards, 41 [[touchdown]]s and three [[Interception (football)|interceptions]].

==Professional career==
Mauer ultimately turned down a football scholarship from [[Florida State University]] to enter the [[Major League Baseball Draft]].<ref name="base"/> Mauer was selected by the Twins as the first overall pick of the [[2001 Major League Baseball Draft|2001 draft]], ahead of prospect [[Mark Prior]], who was taken second overall by the [[Chicago Cubs]].<ref name="draft">{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/01draft/2001-06-05-analysis.htm | title=Youth, pitching dominate draft | author=Rod Beaton | date=2001-06-06 | publisher=USATODAY.com}}</ref>

Mauer was part of the United States' roster at the 2003 [[All-Star Futures Game]] at [[US Cellular Field]] before being promoted to the Twins' roster in 2004 after his predecessor, [[A.J. Pierzynski]], was traded to the [[San Francisco Giants]], in the 2003 off-season. Mauer went [[batting average|2 for 3]] in his Major League debut, hitting a single off [[Rafael Betancourt]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] for his first major-league hit.

A knee injury to his left [[medial meniscus]] on April 7, 2004, required surgery and sidelined Mauer for over a month. After a rehabilitation stint with the Twins' AAA affiliate [[Rochester Red Wings]], Mauer returned to the Twins' lineup in June. In July, pain and swelling in his knee forced an early end to Mauer's 2004 season. 

Following his injury-shortened 2004, Mauer signed a contract for $5.7 million with the Twins on January 24, 2005. In 2005, Mauer returned to the Twins' lineup for his first full major league season and had 144 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in 131 games, and ended the year with an average of .294.

Mauer finished the 2006 regular season with a .347 batting average, edging the Yankees' [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Robinson Canó]] to win the American League batting title and become the first-ever American League catcher to win the crown and the first catcher to claim the title since [[Ernie Lombardi]] in 1942 with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]].

After going 2-for-4 in the last game of the 2006 regular season, Mauer confessed to reporters, "When I told you I wasn’t thinking about the batting title?  I was lying.  I’ve never been that nervous in my life.  I haven’t felt anything like that since Opening Day as a rookie.”

Mauer won his first [[Silver Slugger]] award in 2006, announced on November 10, 2006, along with teammate [[Justin Morneau]], who also won a Silver Slugger award that year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2656967 | title=Red Sox LF Ramirez wins ninth Silver Slugger award | date=2006-10-10 | publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

On February 11, 2007, Mauer agreed to a four-year, $33 million contract with the Twins to avoid arbitration. The deal ensures that Mauer will remain in Minnesota long enough to play in the Twins' [[Target Field]] in 2010.<ref name="dollar">{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2762203 | title=Mauer, Twins avoid arbitration with four-year deal | date=2007-02-11 | publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

It was his fifth home run of the season, and there were two players on base when he hit the homer. It was the first inside-the-park home run by a catcher since [[Kelly Stinnett]] did it for the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in 2005. <ref>{{cite web | title=Mauer's inside-the-park HR Twin's first since 2001 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2007-07-21 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270721109}}</ref>
