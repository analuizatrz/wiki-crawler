'''''Singapore Dreaming'''''<ref>IMDb uses ''Mei man ren sheng'' as the film's main title and calls ''Singapore Dreaming'' the film's international English title.[http://imdb.com/title/tt0768837/]</ref> ([[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified Chinese]]: 美满人生; [[Traditional Chinese character|Traditional Chinese]]: 美滿人生; [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: {{Audio|zh-Mei Man Ren Sheng.ogg|měi mǎn rén shēng}}) is a [[2006]] [[film]] set in [[Singapore]]. The film follows the Loh family, a typical Singaporean working-class family, through their aspirations for a better life and the harsh reality that makes it difficult for them to fulfil these aspirations. The film is inspired by a [[2000]] [[essay]], ''Paved with Good Intentions'', that the writers of the film had written for the [[Singapore International Foundation]]. A concatenation of [[e-mail]]s Singaporeans sent to writers [[Colin Goh]] and [[Woo Yen Yen]] on their life stories in relation to the Singaporean dream eventually led them to write, produce and direct ''Singapore Dreaming''.<ref name="mb" /><ref name="npintro">{{cite news

==Plot summary==

<!-- The plot summary appears long, but may not be so. At time of making comment, this summary is 846 words long, while the one in V for Vendetta (film) is about 967 words long. V for Vendetta (film) is a featured article. -->

Poh Huat (Richard Low), the patriarch of the Loh family, works as a lawyer's [[clerk]]. He is married to Siew Luan (Alice Lim), a [[housewife]] who obsessively brews liang teh ([[herbal tea]]) for the family. Poh Huat has a habit of buying [[lottery]] tickets in hope of winning and enjoying a better life. He also keeps newspaper cuttings of car models as well as [[condominium]]s and stores them in a box in his room. 

The family has one son, Seng (Dick Su), and one daughter, Mei (Yeo Yann Yann). Despite Mei's more outstanding academic performance, the family has consistently showed favouritism for Seng, even when he dropped out of school in Sec 3 and returned to [[polytechnic]]. Seng, an apple in his parents' eyes, was due to return after two years at Idoha Polytechnical University. To fund his overseas studies, he had to borrow money from his parents and from his [[fiancée]], Irene (Serene Chen). Irene, who lives with Seng's parents while Seng is overseas, yearns to marry Seng and fulfil her dream of the perfect family.

Mei works as a [[secretary]] who maintained a friendly working relationship with her boss, who values Mei's help as a secretary. She is due for [[Childbirth|delivery]] in two months' time, and for [[maternity leave]] in one month's time. Her husband, CK (Lim Yu-Beng), had quit the army one month ago and turned to selling [[insurance]], but to little success. He is therefore belittled by Mei. Even though they cannot afford it, they went to a condominium [[showroom]] to take a look, revealing their aspirations for more luxurious housing.

Seng returns from the [[United States]], and keeps from his family the fact that he has not graduated. Tensions escalated in the family, especially between Mei and Seng, due to the family's favouritism for Seng. Seng went for several [[job interview]]s, but was told that it would be difficult for companies to accept him, with other candidates with degrees from more prestigious universities. He became immensely disappointed, but lied to his family about the sanguinity of his job prospects.

Poh Huat struck lottery and won $2 million. Seng wanted to try starting a business. He gained acceptance from his father, who gave him effectively unlimited funding. He bought a car, and this was discovered by Irene, who had no prior knowledge of the purchase. Irene became disappointed at Seng.

Initially thrilled by the ability to belong to a higher class, Poh Huat died suddenly while at a country club for a membership interview. Siew Luan went into [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|shock]]. At the [[funeral]], Seng quarrelled with Mei over the funeral expenses; Seng felt that Mei was too much of a scrooge while Mei hit back at Seng for not doing enough work for the funeral. Mei vented her anger on CK, who showed his displeasure by throwing the carton of drinks he was carrying on the floor.  

Mei was recalled back to work during one of the afternoons, even when she was handling the funeral. CK expressed his outrage at this unreasonable request, but Mei says out of frustration, "Singapore is like that, everywhere is like that, [do we have a choice]?" and returned to work. At work, her boss, frustrated at her new temp, asked her to photocopy a stack of notes and brew her a cup of coffee. Mei flipped at the triviality of the task, and faced huge stress.

Back at the funeral, Mei found $500 missing from the ''pek kim'',<ref>''Pek kim'': Condolence money given at a funeral</ref> and wrongly accused her [[maid]], Pinky, of stealing the money. This accusation was made without evidence, but was made under extreme stress and desperation for money. CK revealed shortly after that the money was with him, and Pinky, indignant at the wrong accusation, spat at Mei. CK went to a nearby coffeeshop to drink. A China girl approached him at his table to talk to him, and CK ended up confiding in her about his worries about life. The China girl noted, "You Singaporeans are always complaining. Do you think your life is tough?"

While Poh Huat's funeral was being held, Seng revealed to his family that he did not graduate from university. Initially unbeknownst to him, Irene was just standing at the door and heard his confession. Irene was greatly disappointed at Seng and resolved to leave Seng.

A few months later, Mei, CK and Seng were called to a lawyer's office by the daughter of Poh Huat's boss. Mei has given birth to her son, who was brought along to this meeting. In a last-minute twist of events, it was revealed that Poh Huat's [[will (law)|will]] was found, and that he had willed all his assets to Siew Luan. Deducting the debts and the relevant fees, this worked out to $1.2 million. The daughter of Poh Huat's boss announced that Siew Luan gave $300 000 to Mei and $1 000 to Seng through her. Back at home, Siew Luan handed some money over to Poh Huat's mistress in a show of benevolence.

==Development==

The development of ''Singapore Dreaming'' started in [[2000]] with the New York-based couple Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen, who [[Wedding|wedded]] each other in June [[1998]]. Having lived in [[New York]] from [[1998]] to [[2000]], the couple wrote an essay for '''Singaporeans Exposed''' in 2000, a publication to commemorate the Singapore International Foundation's ten-year anniversary. The 5200-word essay, ''Paved with Good Intentions'', established the difference between the Singapore Dream and the Singapore Plan, and discussed the Singaporean's aspirations and the source of their aspirations. ''Paved with Good Intentions'' was later circulated round the [[Internet]], on which many Singaporeans read the essay.<ref name="mb" /><ref name="stpremiere" /><ref name="blog06">{{cite web

Confessional responses the couple received thereafter reached the hundreds. In a [[podcast]] with [[mrbrown]], Woo cited the typical reader response, "How is it that I now have a house, I now have a car, a job, why I am still unhappy?" The couple "felt a responsibility to do something", and this inspired the couple to write the film,<ref name="mb" /> original working title of which was '''''The 5Cs'''''.<ref name="blog90">{{cite web

==Production==

The film represents the first collaboration between Singapore and New York film-makers. [[Director of photography]] Martina Radwan, [[Film editing#Film editor|editor]] Rachel Kittner and [[sound designer]] Paul Hsu were based in New York, as with the producers personally, while [[Film score|composer]] Sydney Tan was based in Singapore.<ref name="af" />

''Singapore Dreaming'' was an independent, low-budget production. The film cost [[S$]]800 000 in total to produce, 80% of which was raised by Executive Producer Woffles Wu.<ref name="dus" /> This is Woffles Wu's first production, and the Colin Goh&ndash;Woo Yen Yen team's second.<ref name="af" /> Producer Woo Yen Yen had to take no-pay leave from her job as an [[assistant professor]] to produce the film.<ref name="mb" /><ref name="dus" />

Filming began in August [[2005]].<ref name="blog43">{{cite web

</ref> The scenes in the house in the film were shot in a 3-room [[Housing and Development Board|HDB flat]] in a bid for authenticity. This has led to the situations in which the cast and crew had to squeeze in the small flat for hours on end. The team also had to endure heat and stuffy conditions, especially during the scene in which the family was seen having [[Chinese Steamboat|steamboat]] in the living room.<ref name="mb" />

Also in an attempt at authenticity and realism, the producers have decided to allow the characters speak in a mix of Hokkien, English and Mandarin in the typical Singaporean's manner. Meanwhile, the film would be [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] in English and Mandarin so that the audience would be able to understand the characters' lexicon without knowing how the average Singaporean speaks.<ref name="mb" />

Unlike what is typical in bigger productions, the team of directors had to assume numerous roles during the independent production, some of which included the transportation of furniture and buying drinking water for the crew during the shoot. Colin Goh and Steven Chin, the assistant director, also had to stage a fight on Orchard Road to distract curious passers-by and prevent them from gathering round when they were shooting a certain scene.<ref name="mb" />

After the filming, the film was digitally encoded in New York and was digitally projected at certain cinemas. This makes ''Singapore Dreaming'' the first Singapore film to be digitally encoded ''and'' projected.<ref name="blog44">{{cite web

==Cast==

A team of local actors compose the cast for ''Singapore Dreaming''. Some casting decisions were made when the producers were penning the script in New York while some were made in Singapore.

The characters of the film were based on the experiences of the people around the writers, that of the writers themselves,<ref name="mb" /> and on the e-mail responses that they received.<ref name="npintro" />

*'''[[Richard Low]] as Poh Huat''': [[MediaCorp]] actor Richard Low had a role in one of the MediaCorp productions that was filming during the time ''Singapore Dreaming'' was set to film. However, he was not engaged as his character in that production was in coma.<ref name="mb" /> In the film, Poh Huat is the patriarch of the Loh family. He persistently favours and sides with his son, Seng over his daughter, Mei, at one time promising the former of a car. Like the rest of the family, he yearns for a better life and in particular, for a car and a [[country club]] membership.
*'''[[Alice Lim]] as Siew Luan''': Alice Lim was one of the actresses that were cast later. She is the first female [[MC]] for major events in Singapore, and used to be active in the [[1970s]]. The directors admire her 'beautiful' delivery of [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] in the film.<ref name="mb" /> In the film, Siew Luan married Poh Huat when she was young and remained a [[housewife]] ever since. She is seen to brew bottles of herbal tea perpetually (for members of the family, which, except for Irene, tend to reject them). She shares part of her life story with the audience as the film concludes.
*'''[[Serene Chen]] as Irene''': The producers had previously worked with Serene Chen in an earlier production, ''3Meals'', and had found the working experience pleasurable. They had intended to cast Serene Chen as early as when they were writing the script.<ref name="mb" /> In the film, Serene plays the live-in fiancée of Seng, Irene. Irene is deeply attached to Seng and was shown to hanker for a [[marriage]] with him in the beginning of the film. She, together with Poh Huat, funded his overseas studies. Irene is also very close to Siew Luan.
*'''[[Yeo Yann Yann]] as Mei''': Although the producers were unacquainted with Yann Yann, they used her face as a reference when writing for the character, Mei. Back in Singapore, Yann Yann accepted their offer to cast as Mei.<ref name="mb" /> In the film, Mei is the underappreciated daughter of the family, married to CK, whom she occasionally henpecks. Indignant that Seng was sent overseas when she was the one whose academic performance was more distinguished, she bears a patent grudge against Seng.
*'''[[Lim Yu-Beng]] as CK''': The part of CK was originally written for Lim Yu-Beng, who agreed to join the film's production.<ref name="mb" /> In the film, CK resigned as an army officer and turned to selling insurance, a career at which he does not appear to be successful.
*'''[[Dick Su]] as Seng''': Dick Su was involved in the production only after Serene Chen brought him in.<ref name="mb" /> In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.

=== Advertising ===

The directors, with their limited funds, put print [[Advertising|advertisements]] in local newspapers to advertise the film. The last print advertisement appeared in local newspapers on [[16 September]] [[2006]], or the tenth day of the release of the film.<ref name="blog103">{{cite web

Due to the small advertising budget, however, a large part of the film's advertising took place through the Internet. For instance, the film's directors spoke directly to the viewers through their [[blog]] to advertise the film through word-of-mouth. In particular, they instructed viewers to tell at least ten friends about the film.<ref name="blog95" /><ref name="blog100" /><ref name="blog109" /> The producers also appeared on the [[6 September]] [[2006]] release of [[the mrbrown show]] and, in a 31-minute [[podcast]], shared with the audience the production of the film.<ref name="mb" />

As further publicity for the film, Colin Goh uploaded three trailers of the film onto [[YouTube]] to raise awareness and interest about the movie. By [[15 August]] [[2006]], the trailers had 7000 views in total, and one of them had 4000 views.<ref name="trailer">{{cite news

The directors did not submit the films directly to San Sebastian at first. Instead, they sent preview screeners to solicit comments on the film from their friends in New York. The film was spread around and wound up being nominated for the film festival.<ref name="dus" />

The feature film is the first Singaporean film to ''be in competition'' for the two awards at the IFFPA-recognized<ref>''IFFPA'': International Federation of Film Producers Associations.</ref> San Sebastian International Film Festival.<ref name="blog105" /> Moreover, while other Singaporean films (like those directed by [[Eric Khoo]] and [[Royston Tan]]) have won awards at other international [[film festival]]s before, those are either not recognized by IFFPA, or are categorized by them as "specialized". The "specialized" tag means that, as ''The Straits Times'' explains, "they focus on a particular aspect of film or film-making". The film thus has the added honour of being the first Singaporean film to ''receive an award'' at an IFFPA-recognised international feature film festival.<ref name="dus" />

==Soundtrack==

The ''Singapore Dreaming'' [[Film score|soundtrack]] was released by BooBao Records in June [[2006]].<ref name="mxsoundtrack">{{cite web

</ref> [[Stephen Hough]] is also listed as one of the soundtrack's composers. The soundtrack album, containing both emotive and entertaining pieces, show a variation in mood of the songs.<ref name="mxsoundtrack" />

Of particular prominence in the soundtrack is the [[1933]] [[Taiwan]]ese song "Bong Chun Hong". As the producers were writing the script in New York, Woo Yen Yen called her mother to ask her about the most popular song of her time. Her mother's first suggestion was "Bong Chun Hong", a song which the producers came to like.<ref name="mb" /><ref name="imdbtrivia">{{cite web

"Bong Chun Hong" is so popular in Taiwan that it has been described as "their unofficial second national anthem".<ref name="imdbtrivia" /> As Moviexclusive describes Sydney Tan's score, "the […] use of pianos and [[String instrument|strings]] is complemented by the occasional wistful accompaniments of the traditional [[erhu]], adding the essential 'Asian touch' to the music."<ref name="mxsoundtrack" />

The film's soundtrack also includes two songs by the local [[band (music)|band]] [[Ronin (band)|Ronin]], "Black Maria" and "Memories". It also includes "Mei Man Ren Sheng", a song that shares its title with the film. The tune was rearranged by Sydney Tan and performed by Nicole Lai, with lyrics in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] by Ng King Kang. The film's producer, Woffles Wu, did the [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] for the recording.<ref name="mxsoundtrack" />
