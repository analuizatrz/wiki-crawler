The '''Star Alliance''', launched on [[May 14]] [[1997]], is the oldest, largest and most awarded [[airline alliance]] in the world, with the following points of cooperation among its partner [[airline]]s:

*[[Frequent flyer program]] integration allows airline miles to be earned and redeemed on all members of the Alliance at the same level
*Premium customers of the alliance have access to all members' airport lounges.
*Flight schedules are coordinated to permit almost seamless travel which may include several different carriers within the alliance, on a single ticket
*Special fares for round-the-world and similar travel on alliance members offer discounts over booking individual itineraries
*Customer service processes are harmonized in an effort to promote a consistent experience
*Cooperation in development of a common information technology platform

{{TOCleft}}This tight cooperation led to suspicions of anti-competitive behavior, and the alliance was investigated by the [[European Union]] as a virtual merger of its members. Indeed, some speculated that if government regulations were relaxed, the members would merge into a single corporation, although no evidence has yet materialized. Previous to Star Alliance, [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[KLM]] were operating together as the forerunners of the modern airline alliance system since 1993 - although there had been even earlier pairings and groupings of airlines for decades on a less formal level.  The creation of the Star Alliance was a milestone in airline history due to its size and sparked the formation of rivals, notably [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]].
 
Star Alliance now runs 16930 daily flights to 842 airports in 152 countries with [[South African Airways]] and [[Swiss International Air Lines]] having joined at the beginning of April 2006.  The figure also includes the new [[US Airways]], which reached a merger deal with [[America West]] in May 2005.  Its market share is 28%, including [[US Airways]]-[[America West Airlines]], based on the RPK (revenue passenger kilometers).

The alliance developed the "regional" concept in 2004, which helps the Star Alliance penetrate individual markets with the regional participation of smaller carriers. Regional Star Alliance members have to be sponsored by an existing full Star Alliance member.

Star Alliance was voted best airline alliance in the 2005 World Airline Awards for the second time in three years.

*{{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Varig]] &mdash; left alliance on January 31, 2007 due to major restructuring. However Varig has the option to rejoin the alliance within 18 months after leaving Star Alliance following certain audits and the reintroduction of standards required for being a member.

===Potential members===
*{{flagicon|India}} [[Air India]] - India's national flag carrier had reached an agreement to join Star Alliance in [[November 2006]]<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Air_India_set_to_join_Star_Alliance/articleshow/548171.cms]</ref>.

*{{flagicon|Egypt}} [[Egypt Air]] - according to the homepage of the Arab Air Carriers Organization AACO the airline is in early talks with Lufthansa in order to promote their application.<ref>[http://www.aaco.org/pubnews.asp?id=962&lang=1 Egypt Air aims to become a member within the next 24 months.] www.aaco.org, Industry and AACO news, March 8, 2006</ref>  
*{{flagicon|Brazil}} [[TAM Linhas Aéreas]], currently partnered with [[TAP Portugal]], [[United Airlines]] and [[Lufthansa]], was unofficially invited by [[Lufthansa]] to join the alliance in May 2007.

===News===
* {{flagicon|Portugal}} On [[November 6]], [[2006]], [[TAP Portugal]], a member of Star Alliance, signed a contract with Espírito Santo International for the acquisition of 99.81 percent of the regional airline [[Portugália]]. Whether Portugália will join Star Alliance as a regional member or merge its operations with TAP is still unclear. [http://www.flytap.com/USA/en/Company/Press/PressReleases/5121]
* {{flagicon|Australia}} Since May 2007, speculation has arisen that Star Alliance will resume negotiations for Australia's second-biggest airline, [[Virgin Blue]], to join the alliance. This would fill the gap left since the collapse of [[Ansett Australia]] in 2001, and allow Virgin to deliver a better focus on corporate customers.
