'''Simonov monastery''' ({{lang-ru|Симонов монастырь}}) in [[Moscow]] was established in 1370 by monk Feodor, a nephew and disciple of St [[Sergius of Radonezh]]. 

The [[monastery]] land formerly belonged to [[Simeon Khovrin]], a [[boyar]] of [[Principality of Theodoro|Greek extraction]] and progenitor of the great clan of [[Golovin]]s. He took monastic vows in the cloister under the name Simon (hence the name); many of his descendants are also buried there. In 1379, the monastery was moved half a mile to the east. Its original location, where bodies of the warriors killed in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] had been buried, is still commemorated by the old Simonov church. 

During the 15th century, the cloister was the richest in Moscow. Among the learned monks who lived and worked there were [[Vassian Patrikeyev]] and [[Maximus the Greek]]. A white stone cathedral was erected in 1405; it was later enlarged by order of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. As the monastery defended southern approaches to Moscow, it was heavily fortified in the 1640s. The last addition to the complex was a huge multi-storied [[belfry (architecture)|bell-tower]], modelled after [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] of [[Moscow Kremlin]]. 

The monastery was abolished by the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1923, and soon thereafter most of its buildings were demolished to make way for an automobile plant. Surviving structures all date back to the 17th century and include three [[tower]]s of cannon-like appearance and auxiliary buildings in the [[Naryshkin baroque]] style. Recently the Moscow government announced plans for a full-scale reconstruction of the famous cloister.

The first service here after the restoration was held in 1992.
