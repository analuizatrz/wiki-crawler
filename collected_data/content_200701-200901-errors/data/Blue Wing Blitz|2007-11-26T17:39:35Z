''Blue Wing Blitz'' is a traditional [[turn-based]] tactical role-playing game, although it has the particularity of involving mostly [[airborne]] units. These are moved on a grid map, and an encounter with an enemy unit opens a separate, close-up combat screen in which up to two ally units and two enemy units engage in a short [[dogfight]]; the player using menu commands to attack, change altitude or take evasive maneuvers.<ref name="GIA preview">{{cite web | url=http://www.thegia.com/wsc/bwb/bwb.html | title=Blue Wing Blitz | accessdate=2007-07-21 | author=McClendon, Zak | work=[http://www.thegia.com/ The GIA] | archiveurl=http://terror.snm-hgkz.ch/mirrors/thegia/sites/www.thegia.com/wsc/bwb/bwb.html | archivedate=2002-03-31}}</ref><ref name="eg">{{cite web | url=http://eg.nttpub.co.jp/pickup/20010712spe01_03.html | title=航空機どうしの緊迫バトル | accessdate=2007-07-22 | work=[http://eg.nttpub.co.jp/ eg] | publisher=[[NTT Publishing]] | pages=p. 3 | language=Japanese}}</ref>

Different parts of each unit can be damaged, and the success of each attack depends on the units' stats as well as maneuvers.
