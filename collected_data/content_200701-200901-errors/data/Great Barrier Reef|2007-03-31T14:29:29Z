A large part of the reef is protected by the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]].

The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from [[outer space]] and is sometimes referred to as the single [[largest organism]] in the world. In reality, it is made up of many millions of tiny organisms, known as [[coral]] [[polyp]]s. The Great Barrier Reef supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1981.<ref name="UNEP"/><ref name="GBRWHV"/> [[CNN]] has labelled it one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World#Natural wonders|seven natural wonders of the world]].<ref>{{cite web|author=CNN|year=1997|title=The Seven Natural Wonders of the World|url=http://www.cnn.com/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/9711/natural.wonders/|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> The Queensland National Trust has named it a state icon of Queensland.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Trust Queensland | title= Queensland Icons| url=http://www.nationaltrustqld.org/qldicons.htm| accessdate=2006-10-17}}</ref>

The Great Barrier Reef's environmental pressures include water quality from runoff, climate change and mass coral bleaching, cyclic outbreaks of the [[crown-of-thorns starfish]], overfishing, and shipping accidents.

<!-- The oldest dated coral on the reef now is a species of [[Porites]] known as [[boulder coral]], which is only about 1,000 years old (it grows about 1 centimetre per year). Note--this used to be in the Reef Facts for Tour Guides reference until they updated it in 2006. It should not appear in this wiki article until it can be confirmed from a scientific publication.-->

The Reef Research Centre, a [[Cooperative Research Centre]], has found coral 'skeleton' [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] that date back half a million years.<ref name = "CRCage">{{cite web|author=CRC Reef Research Centre Ltd|title=What is the Great Barrier Reef?|url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/discover/coralreefs/coralgbr.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> Corals have been growing in the region for as long as 25 million years, but have not always formed coral reefs.<ref name = "GBRMPAage">{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2006|title=Fact Sheet 1 - Reef Facts For Tour Guides - The Big Picture|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/12437/Reef-Facts-01.pdf|accessdate=2006-12-02}} (PDF)</ref>

Dating [[wikt:discrepancy|discrepancies]] stem from how reefs fluctuate (grow and recede) as the [[sea level]] changes. They can increase in diameter from 1 to 2 centimetres per year, and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 15 centimetres per year; however, they are limited to growing above a depth of 150 metres due to their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level.<ref>{{cite web|author=MSN Encarta|year=2006 |title=Great Barrier Reef| url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575831/Great_Barrier_Reef.html|accessdate=2006-12-11}}</ref>

According to the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]], the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on an older platform about 20,000 years ago.<ref name = "GBRMPAage"/> The [[Australian Institute of Marine Science]] agrees, which places the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. At around that time, the sea level was 120 metres lower than it is today. The land that formed the [[wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] of the Great Barrier Reef was a [[coastal plain]] with some larger hills (some of which were themselves remnants of older reefs).<ref name ="AIMSage">{{cite web | last = Tobin | first = Barry | title = How the Great Barrier Reef was formed | publisher = Australian Institute of Marine Science | date = 1998, revised 2003 | url = http://www.aims.gov.au/pages/research/project-net/reefs/apnet-reefs00.html | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref>

[[Image:Heron Island, Australia - View of Island from helicopter.JPG|right|thumb|[[Heron Island]], a coral cay in the southern Great Barrier Reef.]]
From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, the [[Sea level rise|sea level rose]] steadily. As it rose, the corals could grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain. By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was 60 metres lower than the present day, and corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain, which were, by then, [[Island#Continental islands|continental islands]]. As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged. The corals could then overgrow the hills, to form the present [[cay]]s and reefs. Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years.<ref name="AIMSage"/>The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old.<ref name="CRCage"/>

The remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in [[The Kimberley]], a northern region of [[Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation|year=2007|title=The Devonian 'Great Barrier Reef'|url=http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/668/96/|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref>

==Environmental threats==
{{main|Environmental threats to the Great Barrier Reef}}

===Water quality===
[[Image:Gladstone,_Queensland,_Australia_-_Storage_Silos_on_the_Gladstone_waterfront.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Storage Silos on the Gladstone waterfront - An industrial area in the water catchment area.]]
The coastline of north [[Eastern states of Australia|eastern Australia]] has no major rivers, (except during tropical flood events caused by [[tropical cyclone]]s). It also has several major urban centres including [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]], [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] and the industrial city of [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]].

Due to the range of human uses made of the water catchment area adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef, [[Water pollution|water quality]] has declined owing to the naturally acidic sediment and chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from farming, and to loss of coastal [[wetland]]s which are a natural filter.<ref name= wetlands>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=|title=Wetlands|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/wetlands|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> Principal agricultural activity is [[sugar cane]] farming in the wet tropics and cattle grazing in the dry tropics regions. Both are considered significant factors affecting water quality.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Government Productivity Commission|year=2003|title=Industries, Land Use and Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment - Key Points|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/study/gbr/finalreport/keypoints.html|accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref>

It is thought that the mechanism behind poor water quality affecting the reefs is due to increased light and oxygen [[Competition (biology)|competition]] from [[algae]].<ref name= waterquality>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2006|title=Principal water quality influences on Great Barrier Reef ecosystems|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/principal_influences.html|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

===Climate change===

Most people believe that the most significant threat to the status of the Great Barrier Reef and of the planet's other tropical reef [[ecosystem]]s is [[climate change]], comprising chiefly of [[global warming]] and [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|the El Niño effect]].<ref name="GBRMPAclimatechange">{{cite web |author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/science/climate_change|title=Climate change and the Great Barrier Reef|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>  Many of the corals of the Great Barrier Reef are currently living at the upper edge of their temperature tolerance, as demonstrated in the mass [[coral bleaching]] events of the summers of 1998, 2002 and 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Coral Bleaching and Mass Bleaching Events|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/science/climate_change/coral_bleaching.html|acccessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>

As demonstrated in 1998, 2002 and 2006, corals expel their [[photosynthesis]]ing [[zooxanthella]]e and turn colourless, revealing their white [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons, under the stress of waters that remain too warm for too long.  At this stage the coral is still alive, and if the water cools, the coral can regain its zoozanthellae.<ref name="GuideCoralBleaching">{{cite book

Kleypas ''et al.'' in their 2006 report suggest that the trend towards [[ocean acidification]] indicates that as the sea's [[pH]] decreases, corals will become less able to secrete calcium carbonate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kleypas, J.A., R.A.

Climate change has implications for other forms of life on the Great Barrier Reef as well - some fish's preferred temperature range lead them to seek new areas to live, thus causing chick mortality in seabirds that prey on the fish.  Also, in sea turtles, higher temperatures mean that the sex ratio of their populations will change, as the sex of sea turtles is determined by temperature.  The habitat of sea turtles will also shrink.<ref name="GBRMPAclimatechange"/>

===Crown-of-thorns starfish===
[[Image:CrownofThornsStarfish_Fiji_2005-10-12.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Crown-of-thorns starfish]]
The [[crown-of-thorns starfish]] is a coral reef predator which preys on coral polyps. An individual adult of this species can wipe out up to six [[square metre]]s of living reef in a single year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pierre Madl|title=Marine Biology I - Acanthaster planci| url=http://www.sbg.ac.at/ipk/avstudio/pierofun/planci/planci.htm| accessdate=2006-08-28}}</ref>

Although large outbreaks of these starfish are believed to occur in natural cycles, human activity in and around the Great Barrier Reef can worsen the effects.<ref>{{cite web|author=CRC Reef Research Centre|title=Crown-of-thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef| url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/publications/brochures/COTS_web_Nov2003.pdf| accessdate=2006-08-28}} (PDF)</ref> The CRC Reef Research Centre defines an outbreak as when there are more than 30 adult starfish in an area of one [[hectare]].<ref>{{cite web|author=CRC Reef Research Centre|title=Managing crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks| url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/discover/plantsanimals/cots/cotsmanage.html| accessdate=2006-10-18}} (PDF)</ref>

===Overfishing===
The unsustainable [[overfishing]] of [[keystone species]], such as the [[Triton (mollusk)|Giant Triton]], can cause disruption to [[food chain]]s vital to life on the reef. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased pollution from boats, [[by-catch]] of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and reef [[habitat destruction]] from [[trawling]], [[anchors]] and nets.<ref>{{cite web|author=CSIRO Marine Research|year=1998|title=Environmental Effects of Prawn Trawling|url=http://www.marine.csiro.au/LeafletsFolder/26trawl/26.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Marine Park Zoning|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/management/zoning/index.html|accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref>

===Shipping===
[[Image:Fraser Island Schiffswrack.jpg|right|thumb|The shipwreck of the ''[[Maheno (ship)|S.S. Maheno]]'' on [[Fraser Island]].]]
Shipping accidents are also a pressing concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef. The GBRMPA estimates that about 6000 vessels greater than 50 metres in length use the Great Barrier Reef as a route.<ref name="GBRMPAshipping">{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=|title=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority :: Shipping|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/shipping|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> From 1985-2001, there were 11 collisions and 20 groundings on the inner Great Barrier Reef [[shipping route]].

Although the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired.<ref name=reefdoco>''Reef Dreams: Working The Reef'' [[Documentary film|TV documentary]], [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]], broadcast [[6 July]] [[2006]] [http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200607/programs/ZY6905A003D6072006T180400.htm]</ref> 75% of all ships that use the Great Barrier Reef as a route use the inner route.<ref name="GBRMPAshipping"/> On the outside, wind and swell will push a ship towards the reef and the water is deep right up to the reef so anchoring is impossible.<ref name=reefdoco/> [[Captain Cook]] in the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' nearly came to grief that way, being utterly becalmed and pushed towards the reef by the swell.

===Oil===
It is suspected that the Great Barrier Reef is the cap to an [[Oil reservoir|oil trap]]. In the 1960s and early 1970s, there was some speculation about [[Oil well|drilling for oil]] and gas there.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Institute of Marine Science|year=1996|title=AIMS Science for Management of the Great Barrier Reef - The Great Barrier Reef at a Glance |url=http://www.aims.gov.au/pages/research/smgbr/smgbr10.html|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> In 1970, two [[Royal Commission]]s were ordered "into exploratory and production drilling for petroleum in the area of the Great Barrier Reef".<ref>{{cite web|author=Parliament of Australia|year=2006|title=List of Royal Commissions, 1902-|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/INTGUIDE/LAW/royalcommissions.htm|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref><ref name="1975review"/> Oil drilling is not permitted on the Great Barrier Reef, yet [[oil spill]]s are still considered "one of the biggest threats to the reef", with a total of 282 oil spills between 1987-2002.<ref name="waterquality"/>

===Tropical cyclones===
[[Image:Cyclone Larry 19 mar 2006 0025Z.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cyclone Larry|Tropical Cyclone Larry]] over the Great Barrier Reef, 19 March 2006.]]
Tropical cyclones are a cause of [[Disturbance|ecological disturbance]] to the Great Barrier Reef.  The types of damage caused by tropical cyclones to the Great Barrier Reef is varied, including fragmentation, sediment plumes, and decreasing salinity following heavy rains ([[1990-1995 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons#Tropical Cyclone Joy|Tropical Cyclone Joy]]).  The patterns of reef damage are similarly 'patchy'.  From 1910-1999, 170 cyclones' paths came near or through the Great Barrier Reef.

==Human use==
[[Image:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Starfish on coral - typically, tourists photograph the natural beauty of the reef.]]

===Management===
{{main|Great Barrier Reef Marine Park}}
After the Royal Commissions' findings, in 1975 the [[Government of Australia]] created the Great Barrier Reef [[Marine Park]] and defined what activities were prohibited on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref>{{cite web| author=Commonwealth of Australia| year=1975| title=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/gbrmpa1975257/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> The park is managed, in partnership with the [[Government of Queensland]], through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is widely understood and used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning, management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as [[eco-tourism]] certification) are used in the effort to conserve the Great Barrier Reef.

In July 2004, a new zoning plan was brought into effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for the conservation of [[marine ecosystem]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Zoning Plan 2003|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-02}} (PDF)</ref> While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%.<ref>{{cite web|author=World Wildlife Fund Australia|year=|title=Great Barrier Reef - WWF-Australia|url=http://www.wwf.org.au/ourwork/oceans/gbr/|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> At the time, it was the largest [[Marine Protected Area|marine protected area]] in the world, although as of 2006, the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument]] is the largest.<ref name=BBC_5083974>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5083974.stm Bush to protect Hawaiian islands], [[BBC News]], [[15 June]] [[2006]]</ref>

In 2006, a review was undertaken of the ''Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975''. Some recommendations of the review are that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] Outlook Report should be published, examining the health of the Great Barrier Reef, the management of the reef, and environmental pressures.<ref name="1975review"/>

===Tourism===
Due to its vast [[biodiversity]], warm clear waters and its accessibility from the floating guest facilities called '[[live aboard]]s', the reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially [[scuba diving|scuba divers]]. Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips to the reef. Several continental islands have been turned into [[resort]]s.

As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism in the Great Barrier Reef generates over [[Australian dollar|AU$]]4 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Summary report of the social and economic impacts of the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.|url=http://www.reefed.edu.au/rap/pdf/JUG_SR_09-12-03.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-19}} (PDF)</ref> (A 2005 estimate puts the figure at [[AU$]]5.1 billion.<ref name = 2005Brochure>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Protecting Biodiversity Brochure 2005|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/brochures/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>) Approximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year= |title=Number of Tourists Visiting The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park| url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/tourism/gbr_visitation/numbers|accessdate=2006-10-12}} </ref> Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine [[Tourism|tourism industry]], there are some very popular areas near shore (such as [[Green Island National Park|Green Island]]) that have suffered damage due to overfishing and land based run off.

A variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from [[dinghies]] to [[superyacht]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Onboard The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef - What You Do|url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/yourproduct/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> [[Glass bottom boat|Glass-bottomed boats]] and [[underwater observatory|underwater observatories]] are also popular, as are [[helicopter]] flights. By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are [[snorkelling]] and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality.

Management of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism [[ecological sustainability|ecologically sustainable]]. A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/> This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Onboard The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef - How is the Money Used?|url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/emc/use_of/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref> Plans of management are also in place for the popular tourist destinations of Cairns and the [[Whitsunday Islands]], which account for 85% of the tourism in the region.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/>
Policies on [[cruise ship]]s, [[bareboat charter]]s, and [[anchorage]]s limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/>

The 2003 Pixar film, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', featured the Great Barrier Reef as a setting.

===Fishing===
{{sect-stub}}
The [[fishing industry]] in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Access Economics Pty Ltd|year=2005|title=Measuring the economic and financial value of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/about_us/documents/economic_values_report.pdf|accessdate=2007-03-16}} (PDF)</ref> It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family. [[Wonky hole]]s in the reef provide particularly productive fishing areas.
