On [[September 11]], [[2001]], the  two main towers of the [[World Trade Center]] complex were each hit by aircraft as part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The south tower (2 WTC) collapsed at 9:59 a.m., less than an hour after being hit, and the north tower (1 WTC) followed at 10:28 a.m., causing massive damage to the rest of the complex and nearby buildings. In all, 2,595 people inside and near the towers were killed, along with the 157 passengers and crew aboard the two airplanes.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hirschkorn| first = Phil | title = New York reduces 9/11 death toll by 40 | work = | publisher = CNN |date=October 29, 2003 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/10/29/wtc.deaths/ | accessdate = 2006-07-27 }}</ref>
The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) issued a performance study of the buildings in May 2002, declaring the WTC design sound and attributing the collapses wholly to extraordinary factors beyond the control of the builders.<ref name="FEMA">{{cite web | last = Hamburger | first = Ronald, et al | title = World Trade Center Building Performance Study | work = | publisher = Federal Emergency Management Agency| date = | url = http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf | format = pdf|accessdate = 2006-07-27 }}</ref> In its September 2005 report, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) concurred with this view, noting that the severity of the attacks and the magnitude of the destruction was beyond anything experienced in [[United States|U.S.]] cities in the past.

==Design issues==
{{main|Building of the World Trade Center}}
The towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans, uninterrupted by columns or walls.  This was accomplished using numerous, closely-spaced perimeter columns to provide much of the strength to the structure, along with gravity load shared with the core columns.  Above the seventh floor there were 59 perimeter columns along each face of the building and there were 47 heavier columns in the core.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1CollapseofTowers.pdf |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |publisher=NIST |format =PDF |date=September 2005 |chapter=Chapter 1 |pages=p. 6}}</ref>  All of the elevators and stairwells were located in the core, leaving a large column-free space between the perimeter that was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses.<ref name="NIST-chapter1">{{cite book |author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1CollapseofTowers.pdf |format =PDF |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |publisher=NIST |date=September 2005}}</ref>

The floors consisted of 4&nbsp;inch (10&nbsp;cm) thick lightweight [[concrete]] slabs laid on a fluted steel deck.  A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors.  The trusses had a span of 60&nbsp;feet (18.2&nbsp;m) in the long-span areas and 35&nbsp;feet (11&nbsp;m) in the short span area.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/>  The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were therefore on 6&nbsp;foot 8&nbsp;inch (2.03&nbsp;m) centers.  The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side.  The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] dampers, which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants.  The trusses supported a 4&nbsp;inch thick (10&nbsp;cm) lightweight concrete floor slab, with shear connections for composite action.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/>

The towers also incorporated a "hat truss" or "outrigger truss" located between the 107th and 110th floors, which consisted of six trusses along the long axis of core and four along the short axis. This truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission tower. It was found to play a key role in the collapse sequence.<ref name="NIST-chapter1">{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1CollapseofTowers.pdf |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center (chapter 1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) |date=September 2005}}</ref>

===Anticipation of aircraft impact===

Like all modern skyscrapers, WTC towers were designed to survive major fires. Fireproofing was also added after a fire in 1975 that spread to six floors before being extinguished<ref name="FEMA"/>. Early tests conducted on steel beams from the WTC show they generally met or were stronger than design requirements.<ref>{{cite web | last = Barrett | first = Devlin | year = 2003 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/08/28/steel_type_in_wtc_met_standards_group_says?mode=PF | title = Steel type in WTC met standards, group says | work = The Boston Globe | publisher = Associated Press | accessdate = 2006-05-02}}</ref>

In a less common move, designers had also considered the consequences of aircraft impact. In 1993, John Skilling, who had been in charge of the structural design of the buildings, said that an aircraft impact would cause a great deal of damage and loss of life, mainly because of the ensuing fires, but the structure would not collapse.<ref>Nalder, Eric. "Twin Towers Engineered to Withstand Jet Collision". ''The Seattle Times''. Saturday, February 27, 1993.[http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=1687698&date=19930227]</ref> After the 2001 attacks, Leslie Robertson, who had participated in the structural design of the towers, said that the towers had in fact been designed to withstand the impact of the largest airliner of the day, the [[Boeing 707-320]], in the event one was lost in fog while looking to land. According to Robertson, the modeled aircraft weighed 263,000 lb (119 metric tons) with a flight speed of 180 mph (290 km/h), as in approach and landing, which would have been much slower than the actual impacts of 9/11. He also said that they lacked a good understanding of the effects of such large fires on the structures.<ref name="Robertson">{{cite web | last =Robertson | first = Leslie E. | year = 2002 | url = http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf/weblinks/CGOZ-58NLCB?OpenDocument | title = Reflections on the World Trade Center | work = The Bridge Volume 32, Number 1 | publisher = National Academy of Engineering | accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref> 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology, however, was unable to document the study reported by Robertson and FEMA. Instead it found a reference to a study of the effects of a Boeing 707 hitting the buildings at 600 mph, which would be faster than either of the two planes that hit on 9/11. In line with Skilling's remarks, this study apparently found that the buildings would not collapse in that event. But NIST was unable to find any further details about the study and ultimately suggested that any attempt to compare the performance of the buildings to design expectations would be "speculation".<ref>Lew, H. S., Richard W. Bukowski and Nicholas J. Carino (2006). ''Design, Construction and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems'' (NIST NCSTAR 1-1). Pp. 70-1.</ref>

==Impacts of airliners==
[[Image:World Trade Center 9-11 Attacks Illustration with Vertical Impact Locations.svg|thumb|250px|left|Impact locations for 1 and 2 WTC]][[Image:World Trade Center 9-11 Attacks Illustration with Bird's-eye Impact Locations.svg|thumb|200px|right|Impact locations on 1 and 2 WTC]]
Hijackers flew two [[Boeing 767]] jet airliners, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] (a 767-200ER) and [[United Airlines Flight 175]] (a 767-200) into the towers. 1 WTC was hit at 8:46 a.m. by Flight 11 between the 99th and 93rd floors. 2 WTC was hit at 9:03 a.m. by Flight 175 between the 85th and 77th floor.

A Boeing 767-200 is 48.5 m (160 feet) long and has a wingspan of 48 m (156 feet), with a capacity of up to 62.2 (-200) or 91 (-200ER) m³ of jet fuel (16,700 or 24,000 US gallons).<ref name="Jane's">{{cite web | last =Jane's All the World's Aircraft | year = 2001 | url = http://www.janes.com/aerospace/civil/news/jawa/boeing_767.shtml | title = Boeing 767 | publisher = Jane's  | accessdate = 2007-08-19}}</ref>  The planes hit the towers at very high speeds. Flight 11 was traveling roughly 700 km/h (440 mph) when it crashed into the 1 WTC, the north tower; flight 175 hit 2 WTC, the south tower, at about 870 km/h (540 mph).<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/> In addition to severing a significant number of load-bearing columns, the resulting explosions in each tower ignited 38 m³ (10,000 gallons)<ref name="FEMA"/> of jet fuel and immediately spread the fire to several different floors while consuming paper, furniture, carpeting, computers, books, walls, framing and other items in all the affected floors.

==The fires==
The light construction and hollow nature of the structures allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside the towers, igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors.  The fuel from the planes probably burned out in less than ten minutes, but the contents of the buildings burned over the next hour or hour and a half.<ref>{{cite web | last = Field | first = Andy | year = 2004 | url = http://cms.firehouse.com/content/article/article.jsp?sectionId=46&id=25807 | title = A Look Inside a Radical New Theory of the WTC Collapse | work = | publisher = Fire/Rescue News | accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref> It has been suggested that the fires might not have been as centrally positioned, nor as intense, had traditionally heavy high-rise construction been standing in the way of the aircraft. Debris and fuel would likely have remained mostly outside the buildings or concentrated in more peripheral areas away from the building cores, which would then not have become unique failure points.  In this scenario, the towers might have stood far longer, perhaps indefinitely.<ref name="Gross">{{cite web | last = Gross | first = John L., Therese P.

===Deteriorating conditions===
Calls from occupants trapped in the upper floors relayed information via [[9-1-1]] about conditions.  At 9:37 a.m., an occupant on the 105th floor of the South tower, reported that floors beneath him "in the 90-something floor" had collapsed.<ref name="mckinsey-exec">{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/mck_report/executive_summary.pdf |title=FDNY McKinsey Report - Executive Summary |date=August 2002 |publisher=FDNY / McKinsey & Company |accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref>  Deteriorating conditions were also reported by the helicopters of the NYPD aviation unit.<ref name="nist-ncstar1-8-p37">{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1-8.pdf |title=NIST NCSTAR 1-8 - The Emergency Response |author=Lawson, J.

==Collapse of the twin towers== 
[[Image:South WTC Collapse.jpg|thumb|Collapse of the South Tower viewed from across the Hudson River]]
The south tower, 2 WTC, was struck at 9:03 a.m. and collapsed about 56 minutes later, at 9:59 a.m.. The north tower, 1 WTC, was struck at 8:46 a.m. and collapsed at 10:28 a.m., standing for 102 minutes after impact.

In both cases, the commonly accepted assumption is the damaged portion of the building failed, which allowed the section above the airplane impacts to fall onto the remaining building below. While it took only about 12 seconds to destroy each building, parts of the cores remained standing for about 15 seconds more.<ref>Due to the dust produced by the collapse, the exact times are difficult to determine. See NIST's answers to frequently asked questions, August 2006[http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm]</ref> Both buildings collapsed symmetrically and more or less straight down, though there was some tilting of the tops of the towers and a significant amount of fallout to the sides. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction. 

The collapses were accompanied by loud explosion sounds as the structure gave way and the falling top sections collided with lower floors. They damaged other buildings nearby and producing enormous clouds of dust that covered Manhattan for days. These were composed mainly of pulverized gypsum cladding and [[dry wall]], finely ground concrete from the towers' floors, glass particles, asbestos, and lead (from the many computers in the buildings).<ref>Lioy, Paul J. er al. "Characterization of the Dust/Smoke Aerosol that Settled East of the World Trade Center (WTC) in Lower Manhattan after the Collapse of the WTC 11 September 2001" in ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', Volum 110, Number 7, July 2002.[http://www.ehponline.org/members/2002/110p703-714lioy/lioy-full.html]</ref>

===The collapse mechanism===
Owing to differences in the initial impacts, the collapses of the two towers were found to differ in some respects, but in both cases, the same sequence of events applies. After the impacts had severed exterior columns and damaged core columns, the loads on these columns were redistributed. The hat trusses at the top of buildings played a significant role in this redistribution of the loads in the structure.<ref name="NIST"/>

The impacts also dislodged some of the fireproofing from the steel, increasing its exposure to the heat of the fires. In the 102 minutes before the collapse of 1 WTC, the fires reached temperatures that, although well below the melting point, were high enough to weaken the core columns so that they underwent [[deformation|plastic deformation]] and [[creep (deformation)|creep]] from the weight of higher floors. The NIST report provides a useful model of the situation.
{{cquote|''At this point, the core of WTC 1 could be imagined to be in three sections. There was a bottom section below the impact floors that could be thought of as a strong, rigid box, structurally undamaged and at almost normal temperature. There was a top section above the impact and fire floors that was also a heavy, rigid box. In the middle was the third section, partially damaged by the aircraft and weakened by heat from the fires. The core of the top section tried to move downward, but was held up by the hat truss. The hat truss, in turn redistributed the load to the perimeter columns. (p. 29)''}}

The situation was similar in 2 WTC. In both towers, perimeter columns and floors were also weakened by the heat of the fires, causing the floors to sag and exerting an inward force on exterior walls of the building.

At 9:59 a.m., 56 minutes after impact, the sagging floors finally caused the eastern face of 2 WTC to buckle, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse the the section above the impact area then tilted in the direction of the failed wall . At 10:28 a.m., 102 minutes after the impact the south wall of 1 WTC buckled, with similar consequences. After collapse ensued, the total collapse of the towers was inevitable due to the enormous weight of the towers above the impact areas.

A combination of three factors allowed the north tower to remain standing longer: the region of impact was higher (so the gravity load on the most damaged area was lighter); the speed of the plane was lower (so there was less impact damage); and the affected floors had had their fire proofing partially upgraded.<ref name="NIST"/>

===Total progressive collapse===
[[Image:September 17 2001 Ground Zero 02.jpg|250px|thumb|Portions of the outer shells of the South Tower at right and the North Tower at center left, as well as damage to all the other buildings at the WTC site are shown]]
Once the collapse was initiated, the enormous weight of the portion of the towers above the impact areas overwhelmed the load bearing capacity of the structures beneath them. This was argued in a paper in the days immediately after the attacks by [[Zdeněk Bažant]] and Yong Zhou.<ref>{{cite journal|

Their analysis of global collapse allowed NIST to concentrate their efforts on the events that brought the structure to the point of global collapse. NIST proposed an explanation for the ejections of dust from the windows.

==Collapse of 7 World Trade Center==
The WTC complex comprised seven buildings, three of which completely collapsed on September 11, 2001. At 5:20 p.m., [[7 World Trade Center]], a 47-story steel-frame skyscraper across the street from the rest of the complex, became the third building to collapse. Unlike the Twin Towers, the collapse of WTC 7 had been anticipated for several hours and the building had been evacuated.  A transit (or [[theodolite]]) was used to measure the extent of a visible bulge. <ref>{{cite web|author=Hayden, Peter| title= WTC: This Is Their Story| publisher=Firehouse Magazine|date=April 2002| url=http://www.firehouse.com/terrorist/911/magazine/gz/hayden.html}} </ref>

With the exception of a letter to the ''Journal of Metallurgy'', which suggested that some of the structural steel had been exposed to temperatures sufficient to melt it,<ref>{{cite web | last = Barnett | first = J.R. | coauthors = R.R.

</ref> no studies of the collapse of 7 WTC have been published in scientific journals.

As of August, 2006, NIST anticipated that it would release a draft report on the collapse of 7 WTC in early 2007.<ref name="fact"/> It released a progress report in June of 2004 outlining its working hypothesis. On this hypothesis a local failure in a critical column, caused by damage from either fire or falling debris from the collapses of the two towers, progressed first vertically and then horizontally to result in "a disproportionate collapse of the entire structure".<ref>{{cite web |last = |first = | year = 2004 |url = http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_keyfindings.htm | format = | title = Key Findings of NIST’s June 2004 Progress Report on the Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster | work = Fact sheets from NIST | publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = |first = | year = 2004 |url = http://wtc.nist.gov/progress_report_june04/appendixl.pdf | format = pdf | title = Interim Report on WTC 7 | work = Appendix L | publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref> In answer to the question of whether "a controlled demolition hypothesis is being considered to explain the collapse", NIST says that it "would like to determine the magnitude of hypothetical blast scenarios that could have led to the structural failure of one or more critical elements."

On June 29, 2007, NIST issued a press release stating that it expected to release its draft report on the collapse of 7 WTC for public comment by the end of 2007. <ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | year = 2007 | month = June | url = http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/wtc_062907.html | format = HTML | title = NIST Status Update on World Trade Center 7 Investigation | work = | publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology | accessdate = 2007-07-14}}</ref>

Some authors, most notably [[Wayne Barrett]] and [[Dan Collins (journalist)|Dan Collins]] in their book ''The Grand Illusion: The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11'',<ref>{{cite web | title=Rudy's Grand Illusion | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0635%2Cbarrett%2C74322%2C6.html | accessdate=September 6 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>, have cited the decision to locate the Office of Emergency Management headquarters on the 23rd floor of 7 WTC as a possible contributing factor to the collapse of the building, noting especially the placement of large diesel tanks, against warnings from the Fire Department, to provide backup power for the facility.<ref>http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/5/23/204909.shtml</ref>

==History of investigations==
===Initial reaction===
The collapse of the World Trade Center came as a surprise to engineers. "Before 9/11," wrote the ''New Civil Engineer'', "it had been genuinely inconceivable that structures of such magnitude could succumb to this fate."<ref>{{cite web | last = Oliver | first = Anthony | year = 2001 | url = http://cruachan.televisual.co.uk/asset/GetArticle.exe?DB=e2&DATABASE=e2&LABEL=emap2&RECORD=191265&SEARCH=1| title = Lasting lessons of WTC | work = | publisher = New Civil Engineer | accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref> While the initial damage from the airplanes was severe, it was localized to a few floors of each tower. The challenge for engineers was to explain how local damage could result in the complete progressive collapse of three of the biggest buildings in the world.<ref name="Bazant07">{{cite journal|last=Bažant|first=Zdeněk P.|coauthors=Mathieu Verdure|title=Mechanics of Progressive Collapse: Learning from World Trade Center and Building Demolitions|year=2007|month=March|journal=J.

Interviewed by the BBC in October 2001, the British architect Bob Halvorson correctly predicted that there would be "a debate about whether or not the World Trade Center Towers should have collapsed in the way that they did." The autopsy would involve careful analysis of the plans of the WTC, its construction, eye witness testimony, video of the collapses, and examination of the wreckage. Emphasizing the difficulty of the task, Halvorson said that the collapses were "well beyond realistic experience."<ref>{{cite web | last = Whitehouse | first = David | year = 2001 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1579092.stm| title = WTC collapse forces skyscraper rethink | work = | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref>

===Authority===
Immediately following the collapses, there was some confusion about who had the authority to carry out an official investigation. In contrast to, for example, aircraft accidents, there were no clear procedures in the case of building collapses.<ref>Snell, Jack. "The Proposed National Construction Safety Team Act." NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory. 2002.[http://www.fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build02/PDF/b02044.pdf]</ref>

A team was quickly assembled by the Structural Engineers Institute (SEI) of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], with the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]], the [[American Concrete Institute]], the [[National Fire Protection Association]], and the [[Society of Fire Protection Engineers]] also involved.<ref name="enr-20010924">{{cite news |title=Experts Debate Future of the Skyscraper in Wake of Disaster |publisher=Engineering News-Record |date=September 24, 2001}}</ref> ASCE also invited [[FEMA]] to join the investigation, which later became a joint ASCE-FEMA effort.<ref name="enr-20010924"/>  This investigation was criticized by engineers and lawmakers in the US, however, for its limited funding, authority to conduct an investigation, and access to the WTC site. One major point of contention at the time was that the cleanup of the WTC site was resulting in the destruction of the majority of the buildings' steel components.<ref>Glanz, James and Eric Lipton. "Nation Challenged: The Towers; Experts Urging Broader Inquiry In Towers' Fall". ''New York Times'' December 25, 2001</ref> Indeed, when NIST published its final report it noted "the scarcity of physical evidence" that it had had at its disposal to investigate the collapses. Only a fraction of a percent of the buildings remained for analysis after the cleanup was completed: some 236 individual pieces of steel.<ref name="NIST"/>

FEMA published its report in May of 2002. While NIST had already announced its intention to investigate the collapses in August of the same year, by September 11, 2002, a year after the disaster, there was growing public pressure for a more thorough investigation.<ref>Dwyer, Jim. "Investigating 9/11: An Unimaginable Calamity, Still Largely Unexamined". ''New York Times''. September 11, 2002 [http://www.skyscrapersafety.org/html/article_09112002.html]</ref> and Congress passed the National Construction Safety Team bill in October 2002. This provided the authority for the NIST investigation, which published its results in September of 2005.<ref>NIST. "NIST's Responsibilities Under the National Construction Safety Team Act" [http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/constructionact.htm]</ref>

===FEMA's pancake collapse theory=== 
FEMA developed an early explanation of the collapses, which had come to be known as the "pancake" theory. It was defended especially by Thomas Eagar and popularized by PBS.<ref>{{cite web | last = Eagar | first = Thomas | year = 2002 | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/wtc/collapse.html | title = The Collapse: An Engineer's Perspective | work = | publisher = NOVA | accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref> On this view, when the connections between the floor trusses and the columns broke, the floors fell down, one on top of the other, quickly exceeding the load that any one floor was designed to carry.<ref name="Eagar"/> A number of self-published accounts by structural engineers suggested that a combination of factors led to the collapse, but most suggested a version of pancake collapse.<ref name="Clifton">{{cite web | last = Clifton | first = G. Charles | year = 2002 | url = http://www.hera.org.nz/PDF%20Files/World%20Trade%20Centre.pdf#search='collapse%20of%20the%20world%20trade%20center' | format = pdf | title = Collapse of the World Trade Centre Towers | work = | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref><ref name="Wilkinson"/>

[[Image:Edna Cintron standing in WTC1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A woman stands in the gash in 1 WTC.]]
As in the theory which is currently accepted, the fires were taken to be the key to the collapses. Thomas Eagar, an [[MIT]] materials professor, had described the fires as "the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse".<ref name="Eagar"/> This is because the fires were originally said to have "melted" the floors and columns. As Eagar said, "The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual, and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel." [[Jet fuel]] is essentially kerosene and would have served mainly to ignite very large, but not unusually hot, hydrocarbon fires. This led Eagar, FEMA and others to focus on what appeared to be the weakest point of the structures, namely, the points at which the floors were attached to the building frame. Once these connections failed, the pancake collapse could initiate.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | year = 2001 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1540044.stm | title = How the World Trade Center fell | work = | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | year = 2001 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1604348.stm | title = Twin towers' steel under scrutiny | work = | publisher = BBC News|accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref> The NIST report, however, would ultimately vindicate the floor connections; indeed, the collapse mechanism depends on the strength of these connections as the floors pulled the outer walls in.

===Early column failure theories===
However, NIST's column failure theory had already been articulated, not least by Bažant and Zhou. MIT civil engineers Oral Buyukozturk and Franz-Josef Ulm, probably following Bažant's early proposal, also described a collapse mechanism that was very close to the current consensus already on September 21, 2001.

{{cquote|''Some 60 tons or more of jet fuel could have easily caused sustained high temperatures of 1,500ºF ''[820ºC]'' and higher. Under these conditions, structural steel loses rigidity and strength. The resulting failure of the 2-3 floor system at the site of impact sent the 20 to 25 floors above free-falling onto the 80 to 85 floor structure below. The enormous energy released by this collapse was too large to be absorbed by the structure below. That impact may have ultimately caused the explosive buckling, floor after floor, of the WTC towers. Similar to a car crash in a wall, the towers crashed into the ground with an almost free-fall velocity.<ref>{{cite web |last = Buyukozturk |first = Oral, Franz-Josef Ulm |year = 2001 |url = http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/skyscrapers.html |title = How safe are our skyscrapers?: The World Trade Center collapse |work = | publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology | accessdate = 2006-06-26}}</ref>}}''
They would later contribute to an MIT collection of papers on the WTC collapses edited by Eduardo Kausel called ''The Towers Lost and Beyond'', published in May 2002.<ref>{{cite web |last = Kausel |first = Eduardo |year = 2002 |url = http://web.mit.edu/civenv/wtc/ |title = The Towers Lost and Beyond |work = |publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate = 2006-06-26}}</ref>

===The NIST report===
====Design of the study====
[[Image:WTC1.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The outer shell of the south tower (tower 2) of the WTC is still standing at right. The 22 story Marriott Hotel in the foreground was crushed when the adjacent tower collapsed.]]
After the FEMA report had been published, and following pressure from technical experts, industry leaders and families of victims, the Commerce Department's [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] conducted a three year $24 million investigation into the structural failure and progressive collapse of several WTC complex structures.<ref>{{cite web |last = Newman |first = Michael E. |year = 2002 |url = http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n02-14.htm |title = Commerce's NIST Details Federal Investigation of World Trade Center Collapse |work = |publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref> The study included in-house technical expertise and drew upon the knowledge of several outside private institutions for aid to include:

:*Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers ([[SEI/ASCE]])
:*Society of Fire Protection Engineers ([[SFPE]])
:*National Fire Protection Association ([[NFPA]])
:*American Institute of Steel Construction ([[AISC]])
:*Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ([[CTBUH]])
:*Structural Engineers Association of New York ([[SEANY]])

====Scope and limits====
The scope of the NIST investigation was limited to "the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower."  In line with the concerns of most engineers, NIST focused on the airplane impacts and the spread and effects of the fires, modeling these at a very high level of detail. NIST developed several highly detailed structural models for specific sub-systems such as the floor trusses as well as a global model of the towers as a whole which is less detailed.  These models are [[statics|static]] or quasi-static, including [[deformation]] but not the motion of structural elements after rupture as would [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] models.  So, the NIST models are useful for determining how the collapse was triggered, but do not shed light on events after that point.  As stated in the report, it "includes little analysis of the structural behavior of the tower after the conditions for collapse initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable." (p. xxxvii, fn2)  Some engineers have suggested that our understanding of the collapse mechanism could be improved by developing an animated sequence of the collapses based on a global dynamic model, and comparing it with the video evidence of the actual collapses.<ref>{{cite web |last = Parker |first = Dave |year = 2005 |url = http://www.nceplus.co.uk/fastsearch/ArchiveArticleAssetPT/?AID=22081 |title = WTC investigators resist call for collapse visualisation |work = |publisher = New Civil Engineer |accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref>

===Ongoing investigations===
In 2003, three engineers at the [[University of Edinburgh]], published a paper in which they provisionally concluded that the fires alone (without any damage from the airplanes) could have been enough to bring down the WTC buildings. In their view, the towers were uniquely vulnerable to the effects of large fires on several floors at the same time.<ref>{{cite web | last = Usmani | first = A.S., Y.C. Chung, J.L.

==Remarks by Osama bin Laden==
Although its authenticity was questioned,<ref>{{cite web |last = Larson |first = Mark | year = 2001 |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,,619181,00.html | format = | title = Unwinding the Bin Laden tape | work = | publisher = Guardian Unlimited |accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref> a [[Videos of Osama bin Laden#December 13, 2001|videotape]] of [[Osama bin Laden]] was released that was verified by the Pentagon as indicating that Bin Laden had not believed that the buildings would collapse completely, but would collapse only above the levels where the planes struck:
{{cquote|''We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy, who would be killed based on the position of the tower. We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors. I was the most optimistic of them all. (...Inaudible...) Due to my experience in this field, I was thinking that the fire from the gas in the plane would melt the iron structure of the building and collapse the area where the plane hit and all the floors above it only. This is all that we had hoped for.<ref>{{cite web |last = |first = | year = 2001 |url = http://www.npr.org/news/specials/response/investigation/011213.binladen.transcript.html | format = | title = Transcript of Bin Laden videotape | work = | publisher = National Public Radio |accessdate = 2006-07-28}}</ref>''}}

==Other buildings==
[[Image:September 17 2001.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Portions of the outer shell of the North Tower lean against the remains of 6 WTC which suffered massive damage when the North Tower collapsed. The remains of 7 WTC are at upper right]]
The entire WTC complex was destroyed on September 11, 2001, and many of the surrounding buildings were also either damaged or destroyed as the towers fell. [[5 World Trade Center|5 WTC]] suffered a large fire and a partial collapse of its steel structure. 

Other buildings destroyed include [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]], [[Marriott World Trade Center]] (Marriott Hotel 3 WTC), [[4 World Trade Center|South Plaza]] (4 WTC), and [[6 World Trade Center|U.S. Customs]] (6 WTC). The World Financial Center buildings, [[90 West Street, New York|90 West Street]], and 130 Cedar Street suffered fires.  The [[Deutsche Bank Building]], Verizon, and [[Three World Financial Center|World Financial Center 3]] suffered impact damage from the towers' collapse, as did 90 West Street. [[One Liberty Plaza]] survived structurally intact but sustained surface damage including shattered windows. 30 West Broadway was damaged by the collapse of 7 WTC. The Deutsche Bank Building, known through images of it being covered in a large black 'shroud' after September 11 to cover the building's damage, is currently being deconstructed<ref>{{cite web |last = | first = | year = 2005 |url = http://wcbstv.com/topstories/topstories_story_302000152.html | format = | title = Bone Fragments Found Near WTC Said Human | work = | publisher = Associated Press |accessdate = 2006-09-11}}</ref> because of water, mold, and other severe damage caused by the neighboring towers' collapse.

==Aftermath==
===Site Cleanup===
The cleanup of the WTC site was coordinated by the City of New York Department of Design and Construction (DDC). On September 22, a preliminary cleanup plan was delivered by Controlled Demolition Inc. (CDI) of Phoenix. Mark Loizeaux, president of CDI, emphasised the importance of protecting the slurry wall (or "bathtub") which kept the Hudson river from flooding the WTC's basement.<ref>Post, Nadine M. and Debra K. Rubin. "Debris Mountain Starts to Shrink." Engineering News Record, 10/1/01. [http://www.construction.com/NewsCenter/Headlines/ENR/20011001b.asp]</ref> 

The cleanup of the WTC site was a massive operation. It involved round-the-clock operations, many contractors and sub-contractors, and cost billions of dollars.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} By early November, with a third of the debris removed, officials began to reduce the number of firefighters and police officers assigned to recovering the remains of victims in order to prioritize the removal of debris. This occasioned confrontations with firefighters.<ref>Rubin, Debra K. and Janice L. Tuchman. "WTC Agency Begins Ramping Up Operations." Engineering News Record, 11/01/01. [http://www.construction.com/NewsCenter/Headlines/ENR/20011108c.asp]</ref>

===The debris smoldering fires===

The colossal pile of debris left on the site burned for three months, resisting attempts to extinguish the blaze until finally the majority of the rubble had actually been removed from the site.<ref>http://english.people.com.cn/200112/20/eng20011220_87119.shtml</ref><ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/12/19/archive/main321907.shtml</ref>

===Air quality and the EPA's response===

{{main|EPA 9/11 pollution controversy}}

On September 18, 2001 the Environmental Protection Agency issued a statement assuring the public that the air in Manhattan was "safe to breathe".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/wtc/stories/headline_091801.htm | title=EPA Response to September 11 | accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> In a report published in 2003, however, the EPA's  inspector general found that the agency did not at that time have sufficient data to make such a statement. Also, it found that the White House had influenced the EPA to remove cautionary statements and include assuring ones, in part motivated by the desire to reopen Wall Street. In fact, the collapse of the World Trade Center resulted in serious reductions in air quality and is likely the cause of many respiratory illnesses among first responders, residents and office workers in lower Manhattan.<ref>United States Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General. "EPA's Response to the World Trade Center Collapse." Report No. 2003-P-00012. August 21, 2003.[http://www.epa.gov/oig/reports/2003/wtc/wtc_report_press_statement.htm]</ref>

==Controlled demolition conspiracy theories==
{{main article|Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center|9/11 conspiracy theories}}
According to a 2006 poll, 16 percent of polled American adults speculate that the World Trade Center was destroyed by controlled demolition, not by the effects of the airplanes.<ref>Hargrove, Thomas and Guido H. Stempel III.More than 40 percent of the New York City and NY State population indicate they believe the WT Centers were destroyed by controlled demolition in turn indicating government complicity according to several Zogby polls.
