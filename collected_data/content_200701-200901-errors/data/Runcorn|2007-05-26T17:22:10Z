'''Runcorn''' is an industrial town and cargo port within the [[Halton (borough)|borough of Halton]] in the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Cheshire]], [[England]].   Its population in 2004 was 61,252.<ref name="pop2004">[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/population?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Halton Population.] Accessed [[3 April]] [[2007]]</ref>  The town is located on the southern bank of the [[River Mersey]] where the estuary narrows to form [[River Mersey#Runcorn Gap|Runcorn Gap]]. Directly to the north across the Mersey is the town of [[Widnes]]. Upstream and eight miles (13 km) to the north-east is the town of [[Warrington]], and downstream 16 miles (22.5 km) to the west is the city of [[Liverpool]]. 

[[Runcorn railway station]] is on the [[West Coast Main Line]] and it provides frequent services to [[Euston railway station|London (Euston)]], [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool]] and [[Birmingham New Street station|Birmingham]].  The [[A533 road]] passes through the town from the south and crosses Runcorn Gap over the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]]. This is the lowest bridge crossing of the [[River Mersey]].  The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] runs between the town and the River Mersey, and the [[Bridgewater Canal]] passes through and ends in the town at its junction with the Manchester Ship Canal. 

Runcorn was a small isolated village until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and in the late-[[18th century|18th]] and early-[[19th century|19th]] centuries it was a [[spa town|health resort]].<ref name="S133">Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'' pp133–137</ref>  Towards the end of the 18th century, a port began to develop on the banks of the River Mersey.<ref>Starkey, ''Schooner Port'' p13</ref>  During the 19th century industries developed, in particular the manufacture of [[soap]] and [[alkali]], [[quarry]]ing, [[shipbuilding]], [[engineering]] and [[tanning]]. In the early [[20th century]], the prime industries were those of [[chemical industry|chemicals]] and tanning. The original village has grown to include the its former outlying villages.  Except for the [[chemical industry]], all of the old industries have disappeared, and there has been diversification of industry, in particular because of the close links to the [[motorway]] system, the development of [[warehouse|warehousing]] and distribution centres.

A [[New town|New Town]] was built to the east of the Old Town in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] and beyond this, further to the east, areas of private housing have been established.  This has resulted in a doubling of the population of the town from around 30,000 to its present level.  There has been little integration between these communities and at present there are two shopping centres, two bus stations and two libraries.  The town has the usual community facilities of a town of its size and, in addition, it has a modern theatre and arts centre.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
Runcorn is situated on a spur projecting into the River Mersey which flows to the north of the town and then to its west. On the north back of the river is another spur which forms the West Bank area of Widnes; together these form Runcorn Gap, a narrowing of the River Mersey. Runcorn Gap is crossed by [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]], carrying the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line, and the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]], carrying the A533 road. To the south of the town is the [[River Weaver]] and the Weston Canal which open into the Ship Canal. To the south-east of the town run the [[M56 motorway]], the [[Chester to Manchester Line|Chester–Manchester railway line]] and the main branch of the West Coast Main Line.  The town has a system of [[expressway]]s, roads which divert through traffic from the residential areas of the town. The Central Expressway runs through the centre of the town in a north–south direction.  To the west of it lie most of the former settlements which formed the older part of the town, namely Runcorn, Higher Runcorn, Weston, Weston Point and Clifton (formerly Rocksavage), and the New Town areas of Halton Brook and Halton Lodge.  To the east are the village of Halton, the old settlements of Norton and Stockham, and the New Town areas of Castlefields, Palacefields, Windmill Hill, Murdishaw, Brookvale and Hallwood Park.<ref>[[Ordnance Survey]], ''Explorer'' 275 map</ref>

The density of housing is generally high but there are open green areas, in particular [[Heath (habitat)|heathland]] on Runcorn Hill and an extensive Town Park which was created as part of the New Town.  The older industries, particularly the remaining chemical factories, are concentrated mainly to the south-west of the town bordering the Mersey, while newer industries, including [[warehouse|warehousing]], are to the north-east and south-east.  

===Geology===
Drainage of the Runcorn area is into the Mersey to the north and into the Weaver to the south.  The [[bedrock]] of the western and north-eastern parts of the town is comprised of rock from the Sherwood [[sandstone]] group; in the other areas the bedrock is from the Mercia [[mudstone]] group.  In places there are prominent [[outcrop]]s of sandstone, particularly at Runcorn Hill and Halton Hill.  Elsewhere the bedrock is covered by [[drift (geology)|drift]].  At the north-west periphery of the town the drift consists of recent blown [[sand]], further to the east and bordering the Mersey it is recent [[alluvium]] and elsewhere the drift consists of [[till]].<ref>Phillips, pp4–5.</ref>

===Climate===
Being close to the west coast and the [[Irish Sea]], the climate is generally [[temperate]] with few extremes of temperature or weather.  The mean average temperature in the years 1971 to 2000 was 9.4 to 9.7[[Celsius|°C]], which is slightly above the average for the United Kingdom<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif Met Office: Average annual mean temperature], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref> as is the average amount of annual sunshine at 1391 to 1470 hours.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif Met. Office:Average annual sunshine], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref> The average annual rainfall was 741 to 870 mm, which is slightly below the average for the UK.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif Met Office: Average annual rainfall], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref>  The average number of days in the year when snow is lying on the ground is 0 to 6 which is low for the United Kingdom<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/dl/17.gif Met Office: Days of snow lying], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref> and the average number of days of air frost is 2 to 39, which is also low.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/daf/17.gif Met Office: Days of air frost], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref>

==Government==
[[Image:arms-runcorn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Arms of the former [[Runcorn Urban District Council]]]]
===Civic history===

At the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey Runcorn was in the [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] of Tunendune<ref>Phillips, p27</ref> but later, and until the early 19th century, Runcorn was part of the Bucklow hundred.<ref>Phillips, p9</ref>  Under the [[Runcorn Improvement Act 1852]], a board of [[Improvement commissioners|Improvement Commissioners]] was established to administer the civil government of the town.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p193</ref>  By the [[Local Government Act 1894]], the administration of the town and the surrounding areas were divided into Runcorn [[Urban District]] and Runcorn [[Rural District]].  Initially the urban district consisted of only the built-up area of Runcorn itself.  By 1937, this area had been extended to include the communities of Weston and Weston Point to the south and by 1971 it had been further extended to the east to incorporate the village of Halton.<ref>Phillips, p11</ref>

In 1964, Runcorn was designated as a [[New town#United Kingdom|New Town]]. In 1974, as part of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], Runcorn Urban District was abolished and its territory amalgamated with [[Widnes]] to form the borough of Halton.  In 1998 this became a [[unitary authority]] within the ceremonial county of Cheshire.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/theboroughofhalton?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: The Borough of Halton], accessed [[23 April]] [[2007]]</ref>

===Political representation===
Following the [[Reform Act 1832]] Runcorn was placed in the Northern Division of the Cheshire [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] [[constituency]] and from 1868 in the Mid-Cheshire constituency.  From 1885 to 1950 the town was in the constituency of Northwich.<ref>Phillips, pp. 102-103.</ref>  By an [[act of Parliament]] in 1948, the constituency of Runcorn was created and in 1950 Runcorn's first [[Member of Parliament]], [[Dennis Vosper, Baron Runcorn|Dennis Vosper]], was elected.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p221</ref> He continued to represent the constituency until 1964, when he was succeeded by [[Mark Carlisle]].

Runcorn is in the [[European Parliament|European parliamentary]] constituency of [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]]. The UK parliamentary constituency is [[Halton (UK Parliament constituency)|Halton]] and the Member of Parliament is [[Derek Twigg]].<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/councilanddemocracy/mps?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: MPs], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  The local authority is the borough of Halton and the town is divided into ten [[Ward (politics)|electoral wards]].<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/localdemocracy/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: Local Democracy], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]]</ref>

==History==
The earliest documentary reference to the name of the town is in the ''[[Saxon Chronicle]]'' where it is ''Rumcofan''.  This derives from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words ''rúm'', meaning wide or broad, and ''cofa'', meaning cave or cove, the whole meaning a wide cove or bay.  Subsequent spellings have been ''Rumcoven'', ''Ronchestorn'', ''Runckhorne'' and ''Runcorne'', finally becoming the modern name of Runcorn.<ref>Nickson, p5, Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p4</ref>

Little is known about the early history of the settlement but isolated findings of objects from the [[Stone Age|Stone]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s have been made and there is evidence of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] presence in the area.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp1–4</ref>  The earliest recorded event in its history is the building by [[Ethelfleda]] of a fortification at Runcorn to protect the northern frontier of her kingdom of [[Mercia]] against the [[Viking]]s in 915. The fort was built on Castle Rock overlooking the River Mersea at Runcorn Gap.<ref>Nickson, pp6–13: "The foundations of the fort were discovered during the building of the railway bridge but were covered by an abutment of the bridge."</ref>

Following the [[Norman conquest]], Runcorn was not mentioned in the 1086 [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey, although surrounding settlements were. [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] granted the [[Earl of Chester|earldom of Chester]] to [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh d'Avranches]] who granted the [[Barons of Halton|barony of Halton]] to Nigel.  It is likely that Nigel erected a [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]] on Halton Hill in the 1070s.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp7–8</ref>  In 1115, Nigel's son, William Fitznigel, founded an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at Runcorn. In 1134 the priory was moved to Norton, about 3.5 miles (5.5 km) away. In 1391, the priory was raised to the higher status of [[abbey]].<ref>Greene, pp1–9</ref> In 1536 the monastery was dissolved, and around nine years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to Sir [[Richard Brooke]] who converted the habitable part of the abbey into a house.<ref>Greene, p151, Nickson, p39</ref>

[[Image:Halton Castle engraving.jpg|thumb|left|270 px|Halton Castle in the [[18th century]]]]
During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] Halton Castle was held for the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] by John Savage, 2nd [[Earl Rivers]], the Steward of Halton. It fell twice to Parliamentarian [[Roundheads]]. The first siege was led by [[Sir William Brereton]] in 1643; the second was during the following year. Following this, a "Council of War" was held in Warrington in 1646 at which it was decided that the castle should be [[Slighting|slighted]].<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp57–58</ref>  In 1656, Runcorn was described as being "nothing but a fair parish church, a parsonage and a few scattered tenements".<ref>King, Daniel, ''The Vale Royal of England'', 1656.</ref>  And so it remained for over a century, an isolated and poor hamlet.  The only through traffic used the [[ferry]] which crossed from Runcorn to the north bank of the River Mersey.  Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early years of the 19th century the town was a health resort.<ref name="S133"/>

[[Image:Runcorn soapworks.jpg|thumb|250 px|Soap and alkali works on the Bridgewater canal during the 19th century]]
During the 18th century water transport had been improved in the area by the Mersey and [[Irwell]] Navigation, the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]].  This gave Runcorn waterway connections with most of the interior of England through the [[canal]] system and with the sea along the River Mersey, thus forming the basis for the development of the [[Port of Runcorn]].<ref>Starkey, ''Schooner Port'', pp19–24, ''Old Runcorn'', pp125–130.</ref>  Later came the Runcorn to [[Latchford]] canal, and the Weston canal which gave better access to the Weaver Navigation system.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p. 173.</ref>  Industries began to develop within and around the town, in particular [[quarrying]] for Runcorn [[sandstone]], [[shipbuilding]], [[engineering]], the manufacture of [[soap]] and [[chemicals]] and [[tanning]].  Runcorn was becoming an industrialised and highly [[polluted]] town.  During the later 19th century the town became increasingly dominated by the chemical and tanning industries.  

In 1868 the [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]] was opened across the Mersey, giving Runcorn direct rail links with [[Liverpool]] and the rest of the country.<ref>Nickson, p206</ref>  In the 1880s, a pipeline was opened between Northwich and Weston Point, supplying [[brine]] to the salt and chemical works.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp160–162</ref>  In 1894 the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was opened throughout its length.<ref>Starkey, ''Schooner Port'', p. 184.</ref>  This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as [[Salford]], some of them calling at the port of Runcorn.  The rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the drop by 1901 is explained by the number of people involved in constructing the ship canal.  In 1905 the [[Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge|Widnes–Runcorn Transporter Bridge]] opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.<ref>Thompson, ''Bridging the Years'', p17</ref>

During the first half of the 20th century the industry of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning.  In 1926 four chemical companies merged to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).  As the century progressed there was diversification of industry. In 1961 the Transporter Bridge was replaced by Runcorn Road Bridge (since named the Silver Jubilee Bridge) which allowed a more efficient means of road traffic across Runcorn Gap.  Major changes came with the designation of Runcorn [[New Town]] in 1964. The tanneries had been declining and the last one closed in 1968.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p221</ref>  The chemical industry has declined while there has been development of light industry in the Old Town and around the outskirts of the New Town together with warehouses and distribution centres.

==Landmarks and places of interest==
[[Image:Halton Castle.jpg|thumb|Halton Castle]]
The major landmark in the town is Halton Castle on the top of Halton Hill near the geographical centre of the town. Only ruins of the castle exist but there are widespread views from the top of the hill.  The interior of the castle grounds is open at advertised times.<ref>[http://www.haltoncastle.org Halton Castle], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  Incorporated in the castle walls is the Castle Hotel which used to include a courthouse on the first floor.  Another landmark is Norton water tower, built of Runcorn sandstone, 112 feet (34 metres) high, which holds 672,000 imperial [[gallon]]s (3 million [[litre]]s) of water and supplies water to Liverpool.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p162</ref>

An important historical site and the major visitor centre in the town is Norton Priory which is a museum.  The site contains the remains of the ancient priory with adjacent gardens which used to be those of a country house.  Nearby are a [[walled garden]] which includes the national collection of tree [[quince]]s and an [[Icehouse (building)|ice house]].<ref>[http://www.rossbullock.co.uk Norton Priory 1], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]]</ref><ref name="np2">[http://www.nortonpriory.org Norton Priory 2], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]]</ref>
[[Image:Halton Grange, Runcorn.jpg|thumb|left|Runcorn Town Hall, formerly Halton Grange]]

Much of the architecture of the town is undistinguished but there are [[Listed buildings in Runcorn, Cheshire|listed buildings]].  The listed churches are All Saints Parish Church and Holy Trinity Church in the Old Town centre, St Mary's in Halton village, St John's in Weston and Christ Church in Weston Point.  The oldest existing houses are the Seneschal's house in Halton village (1598), Weston Old Hall (1607), Brookfield Farmhouse (1691) and Halton Old Hall (1693).  Other outstanding houses include Runcorn Town Hall (formerly Halton Grange), Camden House and Cottage in High Street, and Bridgewater House near the Ship Canal.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/environment/planning/forwardplanning/listedconservationareas/listedbuildings?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Listed buildings in Halton], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]]</ref>

The [[war memorial]] to the men who served in both [[world war]]s is sited at the top of Greenway Road. There is a memorial in Castle Road, Halton village, commemorating residents of the village who served in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].  There is [[public art|public sculpture]] in the town.  In High Street in the Old Town centre is Runcorn Spire, a metal structure which represents features of the history of the town.  In Mersey Road, overlooking the Ship Canal, is a boat-shaped sculpture with the head of Ethelfreda as its figurehead.  On the top of the market hall in the Old Town centre is Runcorn Dome which represents the shipping and chemical industries. On Runcorn Hill and on Wigg Island there are sculptures, mainly in wood.

==Demographics==
Since the borough of Halton became a unitary authority in 1998, which resulted in its having one level of local government, demographic statistics have been collated for the authority as a whole, rather than separately for the towns of Runcorn and Widnes.  While the two towns have different histories and come from different historic counties, their demographic features are similar and can be found [[Halton (borough)#Demographics|here]].

==Economy==
Of the former industries of Runcorn, all but the chemical industry have disappeared.  This was dominated by ICI but it has been taken over by [[Ineos]].  In Runcorn Ineos manufactures chemicals including [[chlorine]], chlorine-containing compounds including [[vinyl chloride]], heavy chemicals including [[alkali]]s, and [[flourine]]-containing compounds.  A separate business within the same company manufactures salt from [[brine]] transported by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] from the saltfields of central Cheshire.<ref>[http://www.ineos.com/index.php Ineos], accessed [[29 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  The former ICI offices and laboratories comprise The Heath Business and Technical Park which provides office, laboratory, conference and leisure facilities.<ref>[http://www.theheath.com/ The Heath Business and Technical Park], accessed [[29 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  To the east of the town diverse industries have been developed including, because of the proximity to the motorway system, [[warehouse]]s and distribution centres.  The town continues to act as a port on the Manchester Ship Canal.  There are two adjacent ports, Runcorn Port, which is owned by the Manchester Ship Canal,<ref>[http://www.clydeport.co.uk/index.php?site_id=6&page_id=417 Port of Runcorn], accessed [[14 May]] [[2007]]</ref> and The Port of Weston.<ref>[http://www.portweston.co.uk/index.htm The Port of Weston], accessed [[14 May]] [[2007]]</ref>

[[Image:Runcorn High Street.jpg|thumb|Runcorn High Street]]
Runcorn has two shopping centres. The original shopping area was in the Old Town and was based in High Street, Regent Street and Church Street.  This continues to exist, but with the coming of the New Town, has declined.  There is a small supermarket and some specialist shops but a higher than average proportion of [[charity shop]]s and [[Take-out|take-away]] food outlets.  A small market has been rebuilt adjacent to the Old Town bus station.  In the centre of the New Town area [[Halton Lea]] (formerly called Shopping City) is an enclosed [[shopping mall]] with an attached bus station.  Adjacent to it is Trident Park containing shopping outlets and a cinema and further away is an [[ASDA]] supermarket.

==Culture==
===Theatre and cinema===
''[[The Brindley]]'' is a theatre and arts centre which opened in 2004.  It is situated in the Old Town Centre and named after [[James Brindley]], engineer of the adjacent Bridgewater Canal.  It contains a [[proscenium]] theatre seating 420 and a multi-purpose theatre seating 108, ''The Studio'', which doubles as a cinema.  There is an exhibition space for art installations, a small café and separate rooms for different purposes.  The theatre is owned and administered by Halton Borough Council which runs community events in the building.<ref>[http://www.thebrindley.org.uk/ The Brindley], accessed [[29 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  A [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex cinema]] run by [[Cineworld]] is sited in Trident Park.

===Filmography===
Runcorn has been used for the shooting of films and television programmes.  Some of the sequences of the first two series of the [[BBC]] police drama ''[[Merseybeat (TV series)|Merseybeat]]'' were filmed in and around the town.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/merseybeat/ BBC: Merseybeat], accessed [[30 March]] [[2007]]</ref> The BBC [[situation comedy]] ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]'' is set in Runcorn. External shots of the Waterloo Hotel in the area of High Street known as Top Locks (which is known in the show as The Archer) appear in that show and the opening credits show the Silver Jubilee Bridge and Halton Castle.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/twopints/ BBC: Two Pints], accessed [[30 March]] [[2007]]</ref> ''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous]]'', a four-part comedy drama on [[BBC Three]], was set in Runcorn.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/gorgeous/ BBC: Drop Dead Gorgeous], accessed [[30 March]] [[2007]]</ref> The interior of the Undercroft at Norton Priory has been used to depict locations in films.<ref name="np2"/>

===''The Runcorn Ferry''===
Before the building of Runcorn Railway Bridge and its attached footbridge, the only way to cross the Mersey at or near Runcorn Gap other than by the dangerous method of [[Ford (crossing)|fording]], was by the ferry.  This has an ancient history which goes back at least until the 12th century.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp10–11</ref> The ferry was celebrated in the [[monologue]] entitled ''The Runcorn Ferry'', written by [[Marriott Edgar]] and popularised by [[Stanley Holloway]].  It includes the lines:

==Communal facilities==
The main library is at Halton Lea with a branch library in Egerton Street in the Old Town centre (which includes the archives of the Runcorn & District Historical Society).<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/tourismandleisure/libraries/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: Libraries], accessed [[22 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  Runcorn has two locations offering One Stop Shop facilities; Halton Lea Direct Link is in Halton Lea and Runcorn Direct Link is in Church Street in the Old Town.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/communityandliving/haltondirectlink/nearestonestopshop?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: One-Stop-Shop locations], accessed [[17 May]] [[2007]]</ref>  Runcorn Direct Link also includes a [[Visitor center|Tourist Information Centre]].<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/tourismandleisure/tourism/touristinformationcentre?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Tourist Information Centre], accessed [[17 May]] [[2007]]</ref>

[[Image:Runcorn Hill 2.jpg|thumb|Runcorn Hill]]
Runcorn Hill Local Nature Reserve has been developed on the site of a quarry and consists of heathland. Adjacent to it is a park which includes a [[bandstand]], a [[Radio-controlled boat|model boating]] lake and sports facilities. Wigg Island is a [[nature reserve]] on previous industrial site.  It is on an island between the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey and consists of open spaces and woodland with bird hides and pathways.  Murdishaw Valley is an area of [[ancient woodland]] to the east of the town between the Murdishaw housing development and the M56. Rock Park is on the site of a quarry in the Old Town area and includes sports facilities. Town Park is in the centre of the New Town development and has a link to the north with Norton Priory.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/environment/parksandopenspaces/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council Parks, open spaces and countryside], accessed [[22 March]] [[2007]]</ref> Open areas in Runcorn form part of Mersey Forest, one of Britain's [[Community Forests in England|community forests]].<ref>[http://www.merseyforest.org.uk/ Mersey Forest], accessed [[22 March]] [[2007]]</ref>

Runcorn's hospital is Halton Hospital which is administered by the North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust.  This hospital is undergoing change.  Originally planned as a [[Hospital#Types|District General Hospital]], it was never large enough to provide a full range of services.  Acute medical services have been transferred to Warrington Hospital and it is planned to provide non-emergency surgery and rehabilitation at Halton Hospital.<ref>[http://www.northcheshirehospitals.nhs.uk/ North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust], accessed [[28 March]] [[2007]]</ref> There is a hospice, Halton Haven Hospice, in the Murdishaw area of the town.<ref>[http://www.haltonhaven.co.uk/ Halton Haven], accessed [[23 April]] [[2007]]</ref>  [[Primary care]] services are provided by the Halton and St Helens [[NHS Primary Care Trust|Primary Care Trust]].  This is in a state of change following the recent merger of the Halton and the St Helens Primary Care Trusts.  In Runcorn [[general practitioner]] services are provided in five health centres and in one separate medical practice in Heath Road.  There are dental practices providing National Health Service and private dental care.<ref>[http://www.halton-health.nhs.uk/ Halton and St Helens PCT], accessed [[28 March]] [[2007]]</ref>
