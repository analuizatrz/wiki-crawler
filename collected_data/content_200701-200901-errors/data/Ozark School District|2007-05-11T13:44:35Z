The '''Ozark School District #14''' is a [[school district|public school district]] in western [[Arkansas]] serving most of northern [[Franklin County, Arkansas|Franklin County]] and a small portion of western [[Johnson County, Arkansas|Johnson County]].  The district is a member of the '''Western Arkansas Educational Service Cooperative''', which includes districts in western Arkansas.  As of 2004, the student population of the district was about 1600.  It is important to note that the above figure was tallied before the [[Altus-Denning School District]] merged with this district the same year, making future tallies notably higher.  The district, most notably the high school,  is most famous for its mascot, the [[Hillbilly]].  Patrons claim that Ozark is the only district in the [[United States|Union]] with the Hillbilly as its mascot, though both the nickname and comparable likenesses are used by other schools.  However, Ozark is the only district to use the nickname and likeness together.

==Statistics==
===Area===
The district covers approximately 566.5 [[km²]] (352 [[mi²]]), including the 40.2 km² (25 mi²) served by Altus-Denning prior to merging in 2004.  The area served is split into two areas. Most of the district covers the central, east-central, and most of the northeastern parts of Franklin County, and a small portion of Johnson County between the [[Jasper Public Schools|Jasper]] and [[Westside School District|Westside]] school districts.  The area separated from the rest of the district by the [[Mulberry-Pleasant View Bi-County School District|Mulberry-Pleasant View]] and [[Huntsville School District|Huntsville]] districts serves the northwest part of Franklin County around the community of Fern.

===Students===
As of 2004, before Altus-Denning merged with the district, the Average Daily Membership of the school district was 1600, with approximately 40-45% of students eligible for free or reduced lunches under the [[National School Lunch Act|Federal School Lunch Program]].

==Schools==
* '''Ozark High School'''
* '''Ozark Junior High School'''
* '''7th Grade Altus Campus''' (formerly Altus High School)
* '''Elgin B. Milton Elementary School''' (physically and administratively split into Ozark Primary School and Ozark Upper Elementary School)
* '''Altus Elementary School'''

==Mascot and Colors==
The school emblem (mascot) and [[School colors|colors]] have been shared by all schools in the district.  The '''[[Hillbilly]]''', which is almost always depicted in purple overalls and armed with a [[shotgun]], was adopted as the school emblem in 1935.  '''Purple and gold''' were adopted as the school colors the same year, replacing the red and white that had been used.  It's important to note that the mascot and colors were similar to that of what was then the [[University of the Ozarks|College of the Ozarks]], whose mascot was the Mountaineer until the 1980s.
