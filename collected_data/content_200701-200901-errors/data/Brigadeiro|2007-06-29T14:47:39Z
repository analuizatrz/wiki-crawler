'''Brigadeiro''' is a simple [[Brazil]]ian [[chocolate]] fudge candy created in the 1920's, and named after Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes, and its shape is reminiscent of that of some varieties of chocolate truffles.

Eduardo Gomes was a [[Brazilian Air Force]] [[brigadier]] (thus the title "Brigadeiro", in Portuguese), who first gained notoriety for playing a part in quashing a communist coup in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Later he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in [[1946]] and [[1950]], during a brief breeze of [[democracy]] that blew in Brazil after the [[Second World War]]. This was a time of shortage of traditional imports such as nuts and fruits because of the war. But, at the same time, [[Nestlé]] was introducing its chocolate powder in the country.

Although Brazil is a major producer of [[cocoa bean]]s, it is believed that the creation and success of the candy was a combination of opportunities: the [[multinational corporation]] Nestlé, which introduced chocolate powder; the creators who named it after a famous politician, the need to find a replacement to imported sweets; and its ease of manufacture. Another version of the story claims that "brigadeiro" is, indeed, a reference to Eduardo Gomes, but not because of his fame as a politician; rather, because Gomes lost his testicles in a battle. The reason for that link being that Brigadeiro doesn't have any eggs in it (In Brazil, eggs can be used as a reference to testicles).

There are two ways to serve brigadeiro. The traditional method is to roll the candy into balls which are then covered in sprinkles. The second method is to leave the candy slightly more fluid and to eat it with a [[spoon]].
