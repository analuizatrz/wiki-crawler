'''Ian Michael Chappell''' (born [[September 26]], [[1943]] in [[Unley, South Australia]]) is a former [[Australia]]n Test [[cricket]]er, who captained Australia between 1971 and 1975 before becoming one of the central figures in the breakaway World Series Cricket (WSC) organisation. Born into a cricketing family, Chappell had an inconsistent career in Tests as an aggressive top order batsman<ref>Scored 2188 runs at 36.46 (stats from CricInfo)</ref> until his appointment as captain<ref>Scored 3157 runs at 47.83 after appointment as captain in early 1971 (stats from CricInfo)</ref>. Subsequently, Chappell earned a reputation as one of the greatest captains the game has seen. Following his retirement, Chappell has pursued a high-profile career as a sports journalist and commentator for the Nine Network in Australia.

== Family and Early Career ==
Chappell was the first of three sons born in [[Adelaide]] to Martin and Jeanne (nee Richardson). He was steeped in the game from a very early age: his father Martin was a noted grade cricketer in Adelaide who put a bat in his hands as soon as he could walk, while his maternal grandfather was the famous all-round sportsman [[Vic Richardson|Victor Richardson]], who captained Australia at the end of a nineteen-Test career. Younger brothers [[Greg Chappell|Greg]] and [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]] also played for Australia, with Greg taking over the Australian captaincy after Ian's resignation.

Chappell attended St Leonards primary school, where he played his first competitive match at the age of seven. He was then enrolled at [[Prince Alfred College]], a private secondary school noted for producing many great cricketers, including Australian captains [[Joe Darling]] and [[Clem Hill]]. Sports mad, Chappell also played Australian football and [[baseball]], going on to play [[Claxton Shield]] for SA and winning All-Australian selection in 1964 and 1966. Aged 18, his potential was spotted in [[grade cricket]] while playing for [[Glenelg]] and he was elevated to the South Australian team for his [[First-class cricket|first class]] debut in early 1962, replacing West Indian [[Garry Sobers]] who had been hired to spend the season with SA.

The aggressive style of Sobers and SA captain [[Les Favell]] heavily influenced Chappell in his formative years in major cricket. In 1962-63, Chappell impressed all with his first century, against a [[New South Wales]] team led by Australian captain [[Richie Benaud]]. Benaud bowled a lot to the tyro batsman and came away impressed by his concentration and technique. Later in the season at [[Brisbane]], Chappell batted at number three for the first time, the place where he would make his name. His debut in the position brought a score of 205 not out. He then spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in [[England]]'s [[Lancashire League]].

== Test Player ==
On his return to Australia, Chappell's form caught the eye of the national selectors and he was selected for his Test debut in a one-off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964. He made 11 and caught well in the slips, but was dropped and didn't return until the fourth Ashes Test of 1965-66. Hitherto, Chappell backed his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips cordon and was a promising part-time leg-spinner. Clearly, at this point the selectors considered him an all rounder as he batted at number seven and sent down 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match. He retained his place for the following Test, and for the tour to South Africa in the summer of 1966-67.

In a defeated side, Chappell found the going tough, failing to pass 50 in ten Test innings and taking five wickets at an average of 59. He then failed twice in the middle order in the first Test against India in Australia. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place looked to be on the line. He responded with his first Test century (151) and three catches. However, he failed in the two remaining matches and his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based on potential rather than form. Responding to the challenge, Chappell topped the Australian aggregates with 348 runs (at 43.5) although he failed to make a century in a series affected by bad weather. By now, he was batting at his preferred place of number three and bowling less, and he carried his good form into the Australian season that followed.

== "The Best All-round Batsman In the World" ==
During the 1968-69 season, Chappell racked up a string of big performances that earned him the Australian Cricketer of the Year award. Against the touring West Indies, Chappell hit 177, 188 not out, 117, 180 and 165 before the new year. Two of these centuries were made in the Tests, where Chappell's average for 548 runs was 68.5. He followed up with a successful tour of India in late 1969. Demonstrating great fluency against spin bowling, he compiled 138 at Delhi and 99 at Calcutta. Chappell's ability against fast or slow bowling earned him high praise, most famously from his skipper Bill Lawry. When the Australians arrived in South Africa from India in early 1970, Lawry told the South African media that Chappell was the best all round batsman in the world. Needless to say, this assessment looked ridiculous at the end of the four Test series - Chappell managed just 92 runs (at 11.5), with a top score of 34.

It was on this tour that Chappell first clashed with cricket administrators over players' pay and conditions. So successful was the South African leg of the tour that the home authorities requested that an extra Test be scheduled, which the Australian Board of Control agreed to. Incensed that the players were not consulted about this change, Chappell led a group of players in a demand for more money to play the proposed game. Eventually, after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down, the extra Test was cancelled.

== Captaincy Surprises ==
A surprise was in store for Chappell at the start of the 1970-71 season when he was named as SA captain. However, Chappell's main objective for the season was to cement his place in the Test team. Younger brother Greg was pushing through the ranks and would make his Test debut during the summer. Facing a tough and talented England side led by Ray Illingworth, Chappell got a fifty in both of the first two Tests, but failed to go on, while Greg Chappell scored 108 on his Test debut. Rain washed out the third Test and Chappell, promoted to open, had a double failure in the fourth Test - another such performance could see him omitted from the team. At Melbourne, he started nervously and was dropped on 0 and 14. Finally, Chappell found form and went to his maiden Ashes century, which he followed up with another hundred in the sixth Test. 

The washed out Test had caused a change to the fixture and an unprecedented seventh Test was played at Sydney in February 1971. Trailing 0-1 in a series that they could still tie and thus retain the Ashes, Australia's performances had been hampered by slow and stodgy cricket. In a radical attempt to breathe some aggression into the team, the selectors sacked captain Bill Lawry and appointed Chappell in his stead. Australia played the sort of cricket required, but lost a close match by 62 runs, forfeiting the Ashes for the first time in 12 years. Chappell gained some consolation at the end of a dramatic season when he led SA to the Sheffield Shield for the first time in seven years.

== A Team In His Own Image ==
Chappell fashioned the Australian team in his own image in the next few years: aggressive, resourceful and insouciant. He remained a dauntless batsman partial to the hook and pull early in his innings, and his players fed off his unhesitating self-belief and conviction that team goals were paramount. Australia were defeated in an unofficial Test series 1-2 by a Rest of the World team that toured in 1971-72 as a replacement for the politically unacceptable South Africans. Chappell was the star of the summer, making four centuries in his 634 runs. He then took the team to England and was unlucky not to regain the Ashes in a tied rubber that ended 2-2. In this series, Greg Chappell emerged as a truly great batsman, coming in one place below his brother and the two shared several crucial partnerships, most notably 201 at the Oval in the last Test when they became the first brothers to score centuries in the same Test innings.

In 1972-73, Australia had resounding victories against Pakistan (at home) and the West Indies (away), where Chappell's leadership qualities stood out in a number of tight situations. He hit his highest Test score of 196 against Pakistan at Adelaide, but was at his best on the indifferent wickets of the Caribbean. The highest scoring batsman on either side with 542 runs (at 77.4), Chappell hit two centuries and a masterful 97 on a poor wicket at Trinidad, batting with an injured ankle. This set up a dramatic last day win when the West Indies needed just 66 runs to win with six wickets in hand, but collapsed after a brief, positive talk from Chappell during the lunch break. Chappell's team would be the last to leave the West Indies as winners for 22 years.

== The Ugly Australians ==
A six-Test series against New Zealand in 1973-74 on both sides of the Tasman brought more success - in the drawn first Test at Wellington, the Chappells created history when Ian and Greg both scored a century in each innings, sharing partnerships of 264 and 86. The Australians surprised by losing to the Kiwis for the first time ever, in the second Test at Christchurch. During this match, Chappell was involved in a confrontation with star New Zealand batsman, Glenn Turner. The Australians then played a very ill-tempered tour match at Dunedin, which didn't enhance the reputation of Chappell or his men, before winning the final Test at Auckland.  On this tour, the behaviour of the team was often called in to question, with some journalists labelling Chappell's team the "Ugly Australians". It would not be the last time they received this type of criticism. In his 1976 autobiography, Chappell wrote about his attitude to the opposition:

''"...although we didn't deliberately set out to be a 'bunch of bastards' when we walked on to the field, I'd much prefer any team I captained to be described like that than as 'a nice bunch of blokes on the field.' As captain of Australia my philosophy was simple: between 11.00am and 6.00pm there was no time to be a nice guy. I believed that on the field players should concentrate on giving their best to the team, to themselves and to winning; in other words, playing hard and fairly within the rules. To my mind, doing all that left no time for being a nice guy."''

== The Ashes Regained and the First World Cup ==
The highlight of Chappell's career came in 1974-75 when he reclaimed the Ashes with a 4-1 win over the touring Englishmen. Fortified by the new opening bowling partnership of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, Australia played hard, physical cricket that didn't endear them to everyone. Chappell led the way with a very aggressive 90 on the first day of the series, but although he made a number a number of half centuries, was unable to score a hundred. His work in the slips was memorable as the Australian fast bowlers created plenty of chances from the shell shocked English batsmen. Within months, Chappell was back in England leading Australia in the inaugural World Cup. Despite his open sceptism of one-day cricket as a legitimite form of the game, Chappell guided his team to the final where they lost a memorable game to the West Indies. By now, the workload was telling on Chappell and the following four Test Ashes series dampened his appetite for the game. His form remained good, and in the last Test scored 192 to set up what appeared to be certain victory. However, England managed to grind out a draw and feeling careworn, Chappell announced his resignation from the captaincy on the last day of the match.

Chappell opted to remain available for Test cricket, and he played the 1975-76 series against the West Indies under the captaincy of his brother Greg. Once again, Chappell proved himself as a great performer in adversity when he made 156 during Australia's only loss for the summer, at Perth in the second Test. Always prepared to take on the Caribbean fast bowlers, he finished with 449 runs in the six Tests at an average of 44.9 and announced his retirement from first class cricket, aged only 32. The summer ended in controversy and triumph as he threatened strike action for his South Australian team, but after the matter was sorted out to his satisfaction, Chappell took his team to the Sheffield Shield for the second time in his career.

== Rebel Skipper  ==
Chappell was hired to spend the summer of 1976-77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne district competition. Here he crossed paths with a young English all rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship. The infamous altercation in a Melbourne pub between Ian Botham and Ian Chappell is part of the game's folklore, and several versions have been put forward as to what happened. Most agree it was a case of Botham assaulting Chappell and chasing him from the premises in reaction to some disparaging remarks made by Chappell about England and her cricketers. 

But more important events for the game's future were taking shape at this point. English commentator John Arlott described Chappell as "a cricketer of effect rather than the graces", and his part in the World Series Cricket (WSC) schism arose after years of disaffection with cricket officialdom. Chappell was approached to lead an Australian team in a proposed break away professional competition organised by media moghul Kerry Packer for his Nine Network. A number of Australian players were signed on his recommendation and he was a central figure in the organisation and marketing of WSC. 

Chappell played two seasons (1977-78 and 1978-79) in Australia as captain of the WSC Australian XI, enhancing his reputation against high quality opposition as both batsman and captain. In early 1979, he led a tour to the West Indies where a very hard-fought series finished in a 1-1 result, which some considered his greatest captaincy achievement.

== Return To Tests ==
Convinced to return to official cricket when WSC and the Australian Cricket Board declared a truce, Chappell resumed as captain of South Australia, but ruled himself out as a candidate for the Test captaincy, which was once again given to his brother Greg. This proved to be a season too far for the increasingly irascible Chappell, who clashed with umpires and administrators during the course of the summer. He was controversially selected for Australia mid-season, and his Test career finished with scores of 75 and 26 not out at the MCG against England in February 1980.

== Media career ==
Chappell moved into the commentary box with the Nine Network in the 1980-81 season, where he has remained ever since. One of the first major controversies that he had to cover was the "Underarm Incident" which involved his two younger brothers in an ODI played by Australia against New Zealand at the MCG. To his credit, Chappell showed no fraternal bias and was vehement in his criticism of the tactic. He wrote in a newspaper column on the matter: "Fair dinkum, Greg, how much pride do you sacrifice to win $35,000?"

== Private Life ==
After leaving school, Chappell spent two years as a clerk in sharebroker's office which ended when he went to play league cricket in England. He then worked as a promotions representative for Nestle and the cigarette manufacturer WD & HO Wills. After eight years with Wills, Chappell capitalised on his fame as Australian captain by forming his own company specialising in advertising, promotion and journalism, which has remained his profession. He is twice married, and has a daughter Amanda with his first wife Kay. Chappell now lives in Sydney with second wife Barbara.
