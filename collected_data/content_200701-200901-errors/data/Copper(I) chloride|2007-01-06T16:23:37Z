'''Copper(I) chloride''' (quite commonly called '''cuprous chloride'''), is the lower [[chloride]] of [[copper]], with the formula CuCl.  It occurs naturally as the mineral [[nantokite]].  It is a white solid which is almost insoluble in water, and which tends to [[Redox|oxidise]] in air to green [[Copper(II) chloride|CuCl<sub>2</sub>]].  It is a [[Lewis acid]] which reacts with suitable ligands such as [[ammonia]] or [[chloride]] ion to form [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]], many of which are water-soluble.  It is even able to form a stable complex with [[carbon monoxide]].

In [[aqueous]] solution, CuCl would be unstable with respect to [[disproportionation]] into [[Copper|Cu]] and [[Copper(II) chloride|CuCl<sub>2</sub>]], but its low [[solubility]] allows it to be a stable compound<sup>[1]</sup>.

== Chemical Properties ==
'''Copper(I) chloride''' is a [[Lewis acid]], classified as soft according to the [[HSAB concept|Hard-Soft Acid-Base concept]].  Thus it tends to form stable [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] with soft [[Lewis base]]s such as [[triphenylphosphine]]:

CuCl  +  [[triphenylphosphine|PPh<sub>3</sub>]]  →  [CuCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)]<sub>4</sub>   (Ph = [[phenyl]])

Although CuCl is insoluble in water, it dissolves in aqueous solutions containing suitable donor molecules.  It readily forms complexes with [[halide]] ions, for example forming [[hydronium|H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>]] CuCl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> with concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]].  It also dissolves readily in solutions containing [[cyanide|CN<sup>-</sup>]], [[thiosulfate|S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]] or [[ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]]

Solutions of CuCl in [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] or [[ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]] absorb [[carbon monoxide]] to form colourless [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] such as the crystalline halogen-bridged dimer [CuCl(CO)]<sub>2</sub>.  The same [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] solution can also react with [[acetylene]] gas to form [CuCl(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>)], while an [[ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]] solution of CuCl forms an explosive [[copper(I) acetylide]] with [[acetylene]].  Complexes of CuCl with [[alkene]]s can be made by reduction of [[copper(II) chloride|CuCl<sub>2</sub>]] by [[sulfur dioxide]] in the presence of the [[alkene]] in alcohol solution.  Complexes with [[chelation|chelating]] [[alkene]]s such as [[1,5-cyclooctadiene]] are particularly stable<sup>[4]</sup>:

[[Image:CuCl_COD_dimer.gif|400px|Structure of COD complex of CuCl]]

CuCl reacts with organometallic compounds such as [[methyllithium]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Li) to form "Gilman reagents" such as (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CuLi, which find extensive use in [[organic synthesis]].  [[Grignard reagent]]s react similarly.

== Preparation ==
'''Copper(I) chloride''' may be prepared by the reduction of copper(II) salts such as [[Copper(II) sulfate|CuSO<sub>4</sub>]] using [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[copper]] metal.  [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]] may be prepared ''in situ'' from [[sodium bisulfite]] (NaHSO<sub>3</sub>) or [[sodium metabisulfite]] (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and acid.   The reduction is carried out in [[hydrochloric acid]], and the resulting CuCl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> complex is diluted to precipitate white CuCl (by driving the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] using [[Le Chatelier's principle]]).

(1)  [[sodium bisulfite|NaHSO<sub>3</sub>]]([[aqueous|aq]])  +   [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] ([[aqueous|aq]])  →  [[sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]]([[aqueous|aq]])  +  [[sodium chloride|NaCl]]  +  [[water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]([[liquid|l]])

(2)  2 [[Copper(II) sulfate|CuSO<sub>4</sub>]]([[aqueous|aq]])  +  [[sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]]([[aqueous|aq]])  +  2 [[water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]([[liquid|l]])  +  4 [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]([[aqueous|aq]])  →  2 HCuCl<sub>2</sub>([[aqueous|aq]])  +  3 [[sulfuric acid|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]]([[aqueous|aq]])

(3)  HCuCl<sub>2</sub>([[aqueous|aq]])  +   [[water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]([[liquid|l]])  →  CuCl([[solid|s]])  +  [[hydronium|H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>]]([[aqueous|aq]])  +  Cl<sup>-</sup>([[aqueous|aq]])

== Uses ==
A major chemical use for '''copper(I) chloride''' is as a catalyst for a variety of organic reactions.  Compared to other "soft" Lewis acids, it is much more affordable than non-toxic [[silver(I) chloride]] and [[palladium(II) chloride]], and much less toxic than [[lead(II) chloride]] and [[mercury(II) chloride]].  In addition, it can undergo redox chemistry via copper(II) or copper(III) intermediates.  This combination of properties make copper(I) salts invaluable reagents.

One such application is in the [[Sandmeyer reaction]]<sup>[5]</sup>.  Treatment of an [[arenediazonium salt]] with CuCl leads to an aryl chloride, for example:

[[Image:CuCl_Sandmeyer.gif|400px|(Example Sandmeyer reaction using CuCl)]]

The reaction has wide scope, and usually gives good yields.

The observation that copper(I) halides catalyse 1,4-addition of [[Grignard reagent]]s to alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones<sup>[6]</sup> led to the development of [[organocuprate]] reagents that are widely used today in [[organic synthesis]] <sup>[7]</sup>:

[[Image:CuCl_Kharasch_reaction.gif|500px|(Addition of RMgX to C=C-C=O mediated by CuCl)]]

Although other copper(I) compounds such as copper(I) iodide are now more often used for this type of reaction, there are cases where copper(I) chloride is particularly effective<sup>[8]</sup>:

[[Image:CuCl_sorbate_ester_alkylation.gif|500px|(Alkylation of sorbate ester at 4-position mediated by CuCl)]]

Here, Bu indicates an n-[[butyl]] group.  Without CuCl, the [[Grignard reagent]] alone  gives a mixture of 1,2 and 1,4-addition products (i.e., the butyl adds at the closer to the C=O).

Copper(I) chloride is also an intermediate formed from [[copper(II) chloride]] in the [[Wacker process]].

== Precautions ==
Copper salts do have some toxicity and should be handled with care; wear gloves and goggles.  Avoid bringing CuCl into contact with [[alkyne]]s.
