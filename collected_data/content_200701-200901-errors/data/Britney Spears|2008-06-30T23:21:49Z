{{main|Britney Spears videography}}
Spears's music videos have contributed significantly to her musical success. The video for "[[…Baby One More Time (song)|…Baby One More Time]]" featured Spears in a school uniform that exposed her midriff, an image that helped propel her to superstardom.<ref name=galegroup/><ref name=greatesthitsbooklet>Jenny Eliscu, Spears's career biography from the booklet of ''Greatest Hits: My Prerogative'', page 2–4, Zomba Recording LLC, 2004</ref> Similarly, the video for "[[Oops!… I Did It Again (song)|Oops!… I Did It Again]]" showed Spears wearing a red tightly-fitted catsuit, fueling speculations that the star has [[breast implants]].<ref name=galegroup/><ref name=greatesthitsbooklet/><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Interviews-Features/Article/default.aspx?posting=%7BB90BD588-6E70-4DF1-9DC9-C959EA7AFB50%7D | title=Oops!… Britney's Video Mishaps | date=2 June 2000 | publisher=tvguide.com | accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref> Her image as a "clean, straight-up girl" was revolutionized by the videos for "[[I'm A Slave 4 U]]", "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" and "[[Gimme More]]" which generated controversy by portraying Spears in a more sexually-oriented manner.<ref name=greatesthitsbooklet/>
