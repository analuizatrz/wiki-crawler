{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy VII'''''|ファイナルファンタジーVII|Fainaru Fantajī Sebun}} is a [[console role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]), and the seventh installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. It was released in {{vgy|1997}} for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] and in {{vgy|1998}} for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[personal computer]]s.

Set on the planet Gaia, ''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s story centers on the powerful [[megacorporation]] Shinra, which is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Players follow a young mercenary named [[Cloud Strife]], who joins with several others to stop Shinra. As the story evolves, the primary antagonist, [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], develops a plan to summon a meteor with the intention of injuring the planet to a point where it would gather massive amounts of its life force in one spot, allowing Sephiroth to collect all the life force and gain control of all living beings.

A major critical and commercial success, the game remains arguably the most popular title in the series.<ref>{{cite video | date=2007-08-13 | url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/23449.html | title=Final Fantasy Retrospective Part V | medium=GameTrailers.com feature | publisher=[[GameTrailers]]}}</ref><ref name="mainstream">{{cite web | date=October 2003 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200310/ai_ziff109006 | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[1UP.com]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=May 2008}}<ref name="mainstream2">{{cite web | date=2006 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-29-dirge-of-cerberus_x.htm | title='Dirge of Cerberus' defies expectations, for better and worse | publisher=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref><ref name="GamespostBestAllTime">{{cite web | date=2006 | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/index.html | title='The greatest games of all time" | accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref> The ongoing popularity of the title led Square Enix to produce a series of [[sequel]]s and [[prequel]]s under the collective title ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:FFVIIfieldmapexample.JPG|thumb|left|Navigation on a town's field map]]
Like previous installments of the ''Final Fantasy'' series, ''Final Fantasy VII'' consists of three basic gameplay modes: an [[overworld]] map, town and [[Dungeon (games)|dungeon]] field maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down simplified version of the game's [[fictional universe|fictional world]],<ref name="ignreview"/><ref name="travel">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=15, 44–46 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts|language=English|id=SCUS-94163}}</ref> which the player navigates to travel between the game's locations. It is the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to have character models with fully-rendered polygons, rather than flat two-dimensional [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. As with the preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot or by [[Chocobo]]s, an airship, a submarine, etc.<ref name="travel"/> On field maps, the game's 3D [[player character|playable characters]] are directed across realistically scaled environments, consisting of [[2D computer graphics|2D]] pre-rendered backgrounds, which represent locations such as towns or forests.<ref name="ignreview"/> The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, such as a building's interior or open grassland, in which the player commands the game's characters in battles against [[central processing unit|CPU]]-controlled enemies through a menu-driven interface.<ref name="ignreview"/><ref name="menuinterface">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=20–25 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref> While characters are miniaturized on maps, in combat the character models are more realistic and normal-scaled.

Initially, the player is restricted to a more linear travel within the city of Midgar, but as the game continues, the entire world becomes accessible, giving the player more freedom to explore.<ref name="travel"/> Progression through the game's storyline is largely developed by way of scripted sequences and require frequent player interaction to proceed. At other times, pre-rendered cinematic [[cut scene]]s advance the story.

===Combat===
During its turn-based battle sequences, the game uses the same [[Square Enix battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] and first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Unlike previous games in the series, which allow 4–5 playable characters to participate in battle, ''Final Fantasy VII'' allows only three characters to be in the party at any time.<ref name="ignreview"/>

[[Image:FFVIIbattlexample.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A battle in ''Final Fantasy VII'']]
''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s [[statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|skill system]] is built around the use of [[materia]], magical orbs that are placed in special slots on weapons and armor, allowing players to customize their characters' access to [[Final Fantasy magic|magic spells]], summons, and special abilities. The use of materia is a double-edged sword however, as the more materia a character has equipped the physically weaker he or she becomes. In addition to their individual attributes, materia can be used together in a fixed number of ways to enhance their effects or produce other abilities.<ref name="materiause">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=35 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref><ref name="materiause2">{{cite book | author=Cassady, David | year=1997 | title=Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide | pages=5–7 | publisher=Brady Publishing | language=English | id=ISBN 1-56686-714-2}}</ref>

A modified form of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'''s [[Limit Breaks#Final Fantasy VI|Desperation Attacks]] appears here as the [[Limit Break#Final Fantasy VII|Limit Break]].<ref name="Khosla">{{cite web | author=Khosla, Sheila | date=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | publisher=FLAREgamer|accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref>

Nomura decided to incorporate elaborately animated [[Final Fantasy magic#Summon Magic|summon spells]] in the game, one of which lasts more than a minute.<ref name="Khosla"/> This idea became popular with ''Final Fantasy'' fans, and they were incorporated into the development of future games in the series.  A summon consists of a name for each summon materia (Odin, Bahamut, Titan, etc.), the name of the attack used by each summon, a short animation clip in which the summon makes its attack, and the end of the attack, during which the number of damage points inflicted appears.<ref name="Khosla"/> However, critics have described these animations as tedious.<ref name="summons">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Kennedy, Sam & Steinman, Gary | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=98 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}</ref>

The game's setting follows in the footsteps of ''Final Fantasy VI'' by presenting a world with considerably more advanced technology than the first five games in the series. Overall, the game's technology and society approximates that of modern or near-future [[science fiction]].<ref name="scifisetting">{{cite web | date=2001 | title=Behind The Game The Creators | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1 | publisher=Square Enix North America | accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref><ref name="scifi">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Editors of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=16 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}</ref> The world of ''Final Fantasy VII'', retroactively named "Gaia"<ref name="gaia">{{cite web | author=Choudhury, Rahul | date=2004 | title=E3: Final Fantasy VII Advent Children handout scan | url=http://squarehaven.com/news/2004/05/16/E3-Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children-handout-scan/ | publisher=Square Haven|accessdate=2006-08-11}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=May 2008}} but referred to in the game as "The Planet", is composed of three land masses. The eastern continent features the city of Midgar, an industrial [[metropolis]] that serves as the headquarters of the Shinra Electric Power Company, a ruthless mega corporation that operates as the [[de facto]] [[world government]]. Shinra's major military base, Junon, a reactor that has a condor perched on top of it (aptly named Fort Condor) along with a chocobo ranch and a small town called Kalm.

The western continent features most of the playable areas, which include the Gold Saucer, an amusement park; Costa Del Sol, a seaside resort; the town of Nibelheim, which resides at the base of Mt. Nibel; Rocket Town, which is Cid's home and the location of Shinra's failed space program (which succeeds in-game); the village Wutai; and a settlement constructed on a plateau called "Cosmo Canyon". The tribe inhabiting the canyon emphasize living in harmony with nature and dedicating causes to the planet's well-being.<ref name="cosmo">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=217 | language=Japanese|publisher=Square Enix|id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> Their settlement features an [[observatory]] and serves as a research facility for those who wish to participate in a philosophy known as "the Study of Planet Life", an environmentally conscious lifestyle that encourages utmost deference for nature and teaches that the planet has a life of its own.<ref name="cosmo"/> The northernmost continent is a heavily [[glacier|glaciated]] wasteland, and its few settlements include an excavation site; a ski resort (Icicle Inn in English versions); the mythical "City of the Ancients"; and the Northern Crater, where the game's [[climax]] takes place. There are also underwater locations accessible via submarine, such as the downed Gelnika, which was commissioned by Shinra to transport state-of-the-art weapons and materia to be used against the Weapons deployed by the planet itself when Meteor was summoned by Sephiroth, and the cave where the key needed to enter the Temple of the Ancients lies.

All of the game's main characters have had significant ties to the Shinra Company in their past, and all harbor disapproval or outright hatred for the corporation and its activities. Although the antagonists for the first portion of the game are the [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Executives|Shinra executives]], a mysterious man named [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]]—once hailed as the greatest SOLDIER—reappears several years after disappearing in a battle in which he was concluded to have died.<ref name="sephiroth">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=10 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref><ref name="sephiroth2">'''Aeris:''' What happened to Sephiroth? / '''Cloud:''' In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him. / '''Tifa:''' Official records state Sephiroth is dead.

The game's character designer, Tetsuya Nomura, has expressed feelings that ''Final Fantasy VII'' was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his "true" style.<ref name="Khosla"/> However, he was able to find other means of expressing some of his ideas. Cloud's original character design called for slicked back black hair with no spikes, intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove to be unpopular with fans, and decided to give Cloud a unique feature that would emphasize his role in the game as the main character, Nomura changed the design to feature Cloud's now trademark shock of spiky, bright blond hair. (The original design for Cloud's hair eventually went to Angeal, in Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core) <ref name="Khosla"/> For Tifa's design, Nomura has admitted to facing a difficult decision in choosing to give her a miniskirt or pants. With input from other members of the game's development staff, he eventually selected a dark miniskirt, contrasted by Aeris' long, pink dress.<ref name="Khosla"/>

Vincent's character developed from horror researcher to detective, then to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past. It has been explained that his crimson mantle was added to symbolize the idea of carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders associated with death. Nomura has indicated that Cid Highwind's fighting style resembles that of a [[Dragon Knight (character class)|Dragon Knight]], a [[character class]] so chosen because his last name is the same as that of two previous dragon knights featured in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, [[Characters of Final Fantasy II#Ricard Highwind|Ricard Highwind]] of ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' and [[Kain Highwind]] of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''.<ref name="Khosla"/>

Due to their popularity, several characters from the game have made [[cameo appearance]]s in other Square Enix titles, most notably the [[Versus fighting game|fighting game]] ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'' and the popular ''Final Fantasy''-[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] crossover series ''Kingdom Hearts''. Sephiroth remains one of the most popular villains in video game history, [[Unanimity|unanimously]] voted #1 by the staff of [[video game magazine|gaming publication]] ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' in their "Top 10 [[boss (video games)|Video Game Bosses]]" list in October 2005.<ref name="sephboss1"> {{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of EGM magazine | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October, 2005 | pages=72–73 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media}}</ref> During spring of the same year, Sephiroth won [[GameFAQs]]' best villain contest.<ref name="gamefaqs">{{cite web | author=GameFAQs Site Staff | date=2005 | title=GameFAQs—Spring 2005: Got Villains? | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/spr05 | publisher=[[GameFAQs]] | accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> And in Game Informer's top ten Video Game Bosses list, Sephiroth received number three, behind [[Mother Brain]] of [[Super Metroid]] and [[Psycho Mantis]] of [[Metal Gear Solid]].

===Story===
{{Plot|section|date=March 2008}}
''Final Fantasy VII'' begins with Cloud joining AVALANCHE in a series of raids against the Mako reactors that surround the city of Midgar.  Although the first mission is a success, AVALANCHE is trapped at another reactor during a subsequent raid.  The reactor explodes, which sends Cloud flying from the upper levels of Midgar into the slums below.  He lands unharmed on a flower bed, where he is formally introduced to Aeris.<ref name="secondmeetingwithaeris">'''Aeris:''' You okay? This is a church in the Sector 5 slums.

After Cloud defends Aeris from her would-be kidnappers, Aeris offers to show him the way back to Sector 7. Along the way, she mentions that her first boyfriend had been a first Class SOLDIER, as Cloud claims to have been. They then meet up with Tifa Lockhart, and the three infiltrate the mansion of crime boss [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Don Corneo|Don Corneo]].

The remaining members of AVALANCHE—Cloud, Tifa, and Barret—infiltrate Shinra's headquarters to rescue Aeris. After freeing her and Red XIII, who joins the party, they escape when most of the personnel in the building——including President Shinra——are killed. Finding the body of the president skewered by a long sword, Cloud suspects a man called Sephiroth has returned from his presumed death. These suspicions are confirmed by an executive spared during the massacre, who claims to have witnessed Sephiroth murder the president and state that he would never allow Shinra to claim the Promised Land.<ref name="sephirothreturns">'''Cloud:''' Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth? / '''Palmer:''' Yeah, I saw him!! I saw him with my own eyes! / '''Cloud:''' You really saw him? / '''Palmer:''' Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!?

Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> The party also learns that during Sephiroth's attack on Shinra, the headless body of a creature named "[[Jenova]]" disappeared from the building's research facility.<ref name="jenovagone">'''Cloud:''' …Did it get away?

While [[Rufus Shinra]], the president's son, assumes control of the Shinra Company, AVALANCHE pursues Sephiroth across the planet, fearing his intentions for the Promised Land may be more destructive than Shinra's. During this pursuit, the party is joined by Yuffie, Cait Sith, Vincent, and Cid. As the journey progresses, each member of the group must come to terms with personal conflicts from their past, and the full scope of Sephiroth's plan is eventually revealed to the player: if the planet is significantly damaged, the Lifestream within will gather at the point of injury, attempting to heal the wound. Sephiroth explains that he intends to use a powerful spell known as "[[Materia#Meteor|Meteor]]" to fatally injure the planet, inciting a reaction in the Lifestream to heal the wound before it can cause the planet's destruction. Entering the fissure created by the meteor's impact, Sephiroth would merge with all the energy of the planet, granting him god-like power over it.<ref name="agodtorule">'''Aeris:''' How do you intend to become one with the Planet? / '''Sephiroth:''' It's simple. Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury. The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury. …What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet? Think how much energy would be gathered! Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me. All that boundless energy will be mine. By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence. Melding with the Planet… I will cease to exist as I am now. Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul. / '''Aeris:''' An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?

The Ultimate Destructive Magic… Meteor. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> At an ancient temple erected by the Cetra, AVALANCHE attempts to undermine Sephiroth's plot by claiming the [[Materia#Black materia|Black Materia]] needed to activate Meteor, but Sephiroth displays a mysterious power over Cloud, (which is most likely enforced through the Jenova cells, which Cloud and Sephiroth are both infected with) forcing him to relinquish it.

Fearing that Sephiroth may cast Meteor, Aeris sets off to stop him on her own. Concerned for her safety, AVALANCHE follows her to the northern continent, where the player enters an ancient Cetra city. After finding Aeris praying to the planet for aid, Sephiroth, unseen, begins affecting Cloud's behavior, once again, and attempts to force him to kill her. Cloud resists Sephiroth's command, but Sephiroth himself appears and kills Aeris.<ref name="sephboss1"/><ref name="development3">{{cite book | year=2003 | editor=Editors of Edge magazine | title=Edge May 2003; issue 123 | pages=108–113 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> After laying her body to rest, the surviving characters resolve to defeat Sephiroth and avenge her.

Later, Sephiroth begins causing Cloud to doubt his ability to control his own actions. Cloud begins to doubt his memories and insists he is not a real human, but rather a specimen created from Jenova's genetic material by [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Professor Hojo|Professor Hojo]]. Jenova, the player learns, was an interstellar creature who crashlanded on the planet approximately 2,000 years earlier, arriving via travel on a meteor. This collision formed a large [[impact crater]], grievously harming the planet.<ref name="meteor">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=214, 587 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref><ref name="meteor2">'''Ifalna:''' 2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the Planet.

Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called "[[WEAPON (Final Fantasy)#Final Fantasy VII|WEAPONs]]", while the majority of humans fled rather than fight Jenova. However, a small group of Cetra survivors fought to defend the planet and managed to defeat Jenova, confining it within the fissure created by its landing.<ref name="defense">'''Ifalna:''' A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Afterward, the WEAPONs entered hibernation to await any future threat that could harm the planet. Eventually, the mummified remains of Jenova would be unearthed by [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Professor Gast|Professor Gast]], a researcher for the Shinra Company. Mistaking the creature for a Cetra, Gast was given authorization to conduct an experiment to artificially produce a Cetra by combining cells from Jenova with the fetus of an unborn child.<ref name="jenova"/>

Five years before the present-day events, in a cutscene seen by the player, Sephiroth learned that he was the product of this experiment while on a Shinra mission in Nibelheim, the hometown of Cloud and Tifa. However, unaware of all details involved, he concluded that he was a Cetra who had been produced solely from Jenova's genetic material. Enraged, he burned down the town, intending to kill all descendants of those he believed had abandoned his ancestors in the defense of the planet. According to Cloud, he confronted Sephiroth during this massacre, after which Sephiroth vanished under unknown circumstances and was presumed dead until his reappearance in the Shinra building. When AVALANCHE reaches the Northern Crater, Sephiroth tells Cloud that he was not in Nibelheim, showing him images of a 1<sup>st</sup> Class SOLDIER with dark hair who occupies Cloud's place in his memories.<ref name="puppet">'''Cloud:''' Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say! That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago. That's it, isn't it? / '''Sephiroth:''' I see you finally understand. / '''Cloud:''' But, I want to ask you one thing. Why… why are you doing this? / '''Sephiroth:''' Ha, ha, ha…… I want to take you back to your real self. The one who gave me the Black Materia that day… Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful? Hojo would die if he knew. / '''Cloud:''' Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!? / '''Sephiroth:''' Five years ago you were… …constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt. A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of Mako. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> With Tifa unable to refute Sephiroth's claims, Cloud goes crazy and, thinking it the right thing to do, gives the black materia to Sephiroth's real body, which is encased in crystalized Mako, which results in the WEAPONs' awakening. During the earthquake that follows, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream.

As the meteor summoned by Sephiroth slowly approaches the planet, the Shinra Company focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the WEAPONs,<ref name="defendingtheplanet"/> who have begun to perceive everything as a threat to the planet. The members of AVALANCHE are interrogated, and eventually nearly executed. They escape from Junon and obtain Cid's airship, Highwind. They then search for Cloud. They discover Shinra's plan to take Huge Materia from the major spots of the world. Barret Wallace saves his hometown from Shinra's escort, thus redeeming himself for building the Mako reactor there in the first place. They eventually find Cloud, locating him on a tropical resort island called Mideel where he washed up following the casting of Meteor; he is in a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state. Unable to see Cloud like this, Tifa resolves that she will not leave Mideel until Cloud has fully recovered. The WEAPONs' destructive activity quickly causes the island to split open, depositing Cloud and Tifa into the Lifestream below. There, she reconstructs Cloud's memories and learns the truth about his past. Although the player learns he is a real human being and had actually been in Nibelheim during Sephiroth's attack, he never actually succeeded in joining SOLDIER and only managed to attain the rank of [[Private (rank)|private]] in Shinra's military. The player learns that the dark-haired SOLDIER is named "[[Zack Fair|Zack]]" and was Aeris' first boyfriend. During Sephiroth's destruction of Nibelheim, Zack, Tifa and Cloud fought Sephiroth in Nibelheim's Mako reactor. Although Tifa and Zack were defeated, Cloud and Sephiroth severely wounded one another. After decapitating the body of Jenova, which had been stored in the Mako reactor, Sephiroth is thrown into the Lifestream by Cloud, taking the creature's head with him. Rather than dying, however, his body and consciousness were crystalized in Mako inside Jenova's crater.

While Tifa was taken to safety in Midgar, Cloud and Zack were among the wounded survivors who were apprehended by Shinra as part an elaborate [[cover-up]] of Sephiroth's massacre. Professor Hojo subjected these survivors to an experiment, in which he performed the same enhancements given to members of SOLDIER. However, because Hojo conducted the experiment without any concern for the subjects' mental capacities to handle the procedure, all but Zack entered a [[coma]]tose state. Nearly five years later, Zack broke free from his confinement and took Cloud with him. The player learns that the procedure used to enhance members of SOLDIER involved both Mako showers and the injection of cells from Jenova. The alien cells inhabiting Cloud's body allowed his mind to construct a false persona, built around Zack's behavior, fighting style, and description of Sephiroth's destruction in Nibelheim, but they also allowed Sephiroth to modulate his behavior. The cells' inherent ability to duplicate information led Cloud to believe he had been the 1<sup>st</sup> Class SOLDIER in Nibelheim, as Zack was killed outside Midgar by Shinra soldiers after saving Cloud's life, shortly before the beginning of FF7. During Zack's final moments, he tells Cloud to live "both of their lives" before taking his final breath. Afterward, Tifa discovered Cloud, who was wearing a Shinra Soldier 1<sup>st</sup> Class uniform, which Zack gave him at the Shinra mansion when they escaped from Hojo's experiment, and offered him a job with AVALANCHE.<ref name="jenova"/>

With the truth revealed, Cloud awakens and rejoins AVALANCHE. Before he awakes, the few members of AVALANCHE recovered powerful magic, known as Huge Materia, to counter Shinra's attempts to destroy the WEAPONs and Meteor. During the next few segments, many members achieve their lifelong dreams, or settle their past. Cid Highwind became the first man in outer space, Yuffie Kisaragi encourages her father to return her hometown Wutai to its former glory, and Vincent Valentine learns the truth about his past. The player also learns that, in her final moments, Aeris was casting a spell known as "[[Materia#Holy|Holy]]", the only means of opposing Meteor. Though she succeeds, Sephiroth's focused will prevents the spell from taking effect and has been restraining it since. Deciding that humanity must be protected from the WEAPONs before Sephiroth can be approached, Shinra and AVALANCHE destroy the WEAPONs, but nearly all of Shinra's executives are killed in the process, seemingly including Rufus. Among the few survivors are [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Reeve|Reeve Tuesti]], revealed to be the repentant controller of Cait Sith,<ref name="reeve">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=57 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> and Professor Hojo, who is revealed to be Sephiroth's biological father. He explains that he and his wife were assistants to Professor Gast, and offered up their unborn child as a test subject to research involving Jenova.<ref name="jenova"/><ref name="wife">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=198 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> When Hojo attempts to help Sephiroth gain mastery over the Lifestream afterward, AVALANCHE is given no choice but to fight and kill him. Cloud tells the remaining members of his team to go find what they are fighting for. Every member returns, including Cait Sith, who had been captured by Shinra Inc. for helping Cloud.

Red XIII's grandfather dies, and tells him to go with Cloud to the final battle. With each member of Cloud's group at peace with his or her past and all other opponents defeated, the group travels through the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] of the planet to its core, where they defeat Sephiroth and free Holy. However, due to Meteor's already close proximity to the planet's surface, Holy is unable to destroy it alone. Selected as Meteor's target, Midgar is almost completely destroyed by the storms that spawn from its presence. However, sent by Aeris' spirit, the Lifestream itself rises from the planet to aid Holy by pushing Meteor away, allowing Holy to destroy it.<ref name="aerithsavestheday">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=591 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> During the epilogue that follows, Red XIII sprints through a canyon with his two cubs at his side, he proceeds up the cliff-face, which reveals a lush land of greenery, where the desolate landscape of Shinra's destroyed Midgar had once been. The fate of the rest of the team isn't revealed to the player. It is left purposely ambiguous.

Planning sessions for ''Final Fantasy VII'' began in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]] after the release of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''. At the time, the game was planned to be another 2D project for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] intended the story to take place in modern [[New York City]] in the year [[1999]]. Several of the staff members were working in parallel on ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', and development for ''Final Fantasy VII'' was interrupted when the other project became important enough to require the help of [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and other designers. Some of the ideas originally considered for ''Final Fantasy VII'' ended up in ''Chrono Trigger'' instead. Other ideas, such as the New York setting and the sorceress character [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Edea|Edea]], were kept unused until the later projects ''[[Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' respectively.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

===Nintendo 64DD project and ''Final Fantasy SGI''===
[[Image:FF7 Pic 4.jpg|thumb|An early screenshot of the original demo version, featuring Aeris and Barret with Cloud]]
{{seealso|Final Fantasy VI#Interactive CG Game}}
At its conception, the original script of ''Final Fantasy VII,'' written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, was completely different from the finished product. Tetsuya Nomura recalled how Sakaguchi "wanted to do something like a detective story." The first part of the story, said Nomura, involved a character named "Hot Blooded Detective Joe" who was in pursuit of the main characters. The main characters managed to blow up the city of Midgar, which had already been developed for the story.<ref>{{cite web| title= FFVII Not Being Remade| author=IGN Staff| date=2001|accessdate=2008-04-15|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/793/793956p1.html}}</ref>

''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''{{'}}s co-director and scenario writer, Yoshinori Kitase, returned to direct and co-write this installment of the series and was concerned the franchise might be left behind if it did not catch up to the [[3D computer graphics]] used in other games at the time.<ref name="development5"/> Development then began after the development of a short, experimental [[technology demo|technical demo]] for [[Silicon Graphics]] Onyx workstations.<ref name="development"/>

Called "[[Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game|Final Fantasy SGI]]", the demo featured [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-based 3D renderings of characters from ''Final Fantasy VI'' in a [[real-time (media)|real-time]] battle and incorporated interactive elements.<ref name="development"/><ref name="development6">{{cite web | author=Sutherland, Kenny| date=2003 | title=Elusions: Final Fantasy 64 | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200510/ | publisher=LostLevels | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="development7">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy SGI Demo | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/affw/ffsgi.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]]|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> This experiment led the development team to decide to integrate these design mechanics into ''Final Fantasy VII.''<ref name="development"/> However, as a result of the high quantity of memory storage required to implement the motion data, 3D models, and [[computer graphics]] effects involved, only the [[CD-ROM]] format would be able to suit the project's needs.<ref name="development3"/><ref name="development"/><ref name="development6"/> [[Nintendo]], for which Square had developed all previous titles in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, had decided to continue to use [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]] for its upcoming [[Nintendo 64]] console.

{{Refimprove|section|date=May 2008}}
In 1996, a demonstration disc was released to those who attended [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Tuulisti |url=http://www.tuulisti.com/ff_misc.htm |title=Miscellaneous |accessdate = 2007-08-01 |publisher=Tuulisti's Final Fantasy FFVII Collectibles Website}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=May 2008}} This disc, called ''Square's Preview Extra,'' contained the earliest playable demo of ''Final Fantasy VII'' as well as the 1995 Siggraph demonstration called ''[[Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game|Final Fantasy SGI]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://208.109.211.60/bn_inf.php?type=promo&l=j&id=1387 |title=ファイナルファンタジー?

===Changes from past installments===
The transition from [[2D computer graphics]] to 3D environments overlaid on [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds<ref name="ignreview"/><ref name="gamespotreview"/><ref name="egmreview"/> was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation, which challenged the development team. According to Kitase, "Right from the time the decision to go with CD was made he <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Game producer|producer]] [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]] set down a ground rule for the team saying, 'If the player becomes aware of the access times, we have failed'", demanding that an engrossing atmosphere be upheld, which led to the programming of various animations to activate while the game loaded data.<ref name="development3"/> While the extra storage capacity and computer graphics, to which the team now had access, gave them the means to implement more than 40 minutes of [[full motion video]] movies<ref name="development3"/>—an unprecedented undertaking in the genre at the time<ref name="development3"/>—this innovation brought with it the added difficulty of ensuring that the inferiority of the in-game graphics in comparison to the full motion video sequences was not too obvious. Kitase has described the process of making the in-game environments as detailed as possible to be "a daunting task".<ref name="development3"/>

Among the difficulties faced was the potential inability to render 3D polygon models based on the designs of [[Yoshitaka Amano]], the series' long-time character designer. As his style was considered too exquisite to be compatible with the visual format of the project, this issue was addressed by bringing Tetsuya Nomura on board as the project's main artist, while Amano aided in the design of the game's world map. Previously a monster designer for ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'',<ref name="nomurain">{{cite web | date=September 2005 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdoup/is_200509/ai_n14800453 | title=Nomura | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=May 2008}} Nomura's style was more reminiscent of [[manga]] and was considered easier to adapt. Another development problem was a rushed production schedule. Veteran series [[composer]] [[Nobuo Uematsu]] commented in the liner notes of [[Final Fantasy VII Original Sound Track|the game's soundtrack]]: "There is one thing common in all the ''Final Fantasy'' games. None of them are complete". Despite delaying the game's release from December 1996 to January 1997, several additions to gameplay and story needed to be made for the game's North American release,<ref name="gamespotreview"/> prompting a re-release in Japan under the title "''Final Fantasy VII International''".

===Design and inspirations===
Art director [[Yusuke Naora]] refers to the game's atmosphere as "strong [and] dark",<ref name="development8">{{cite web | author=Coxon, Sachi | date=1998 | title=Interview with Yoshinori Kitase, Tetsuya Nomura and Yusuke Naora | url=http://members.tripod.com/PlayStationJapan/main.html | publisher=PlayStation Japan | accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=May 2008}} achieved through lighting effects he considers "the darkest of darkest",<ref name="development9">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy VIII Kitase, Nojima, Naora and Nomura Interview | url=http://www.ffshrine.org/ff8/ff8_interview.php | publisher=Final Fantasy Shrine | accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=May 2008}} and a story that emphasised realism while drawing on a variety of myths, legends, and religious and philosophical systems to "[use] as a framework for loftier ethical aspirations and ecologically conscious evangelism".<ref name="development5"/><ref name="development3"/> These concepts were reflected in names, such as "Sephiroth",<ref name="sephname">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Famitsu | title=Final Fantasy VII Kaitai Shinsho | pages=26 | language=Japanese | publisher=Famitsu | id=ISBN 4-7577-0098-9}}</ref> Cloud's personal conflicts, the permanence of Aeris' death and the plot element of the Lifestream.<ref name="development3"/><ref name="development5"/> Tetsuya Nomura has explained that, during the early stages of development, the game's original design featured only Cloud, Barret and Aeris, with the intention that one of the three would die.<ref name="development5"/> Feeling Cloud could not die, due to his leading role, and the death of characters such as Barret was already too great a cliché in the ''Final Fantasy'' series and fiction in general, he expressed frustration with the frequent presentation of death in fiction as an awe-inspiring, often romantic idea centered around sacrifice and resurrection. As a result, Nomura suggested Aeris die and not return, believing the audience would not expect such a development, and it would emphasise the sudden, harsh, and irreversible nature of death.<ref name="development5"/><ref name="development3"/> Alternatively, Sakaguchi based the philosophy of the Lifestream on ideas from cultures that believe in an invisible, inextinguishable energy that permeates planets and all life upon them, and was given its in-game representation by Kitase.<ref name="development3"/>

Members of the development team have revealed they intended some aspects of the game's story to be left open to the interpretation of individual players.<ref name="Khosla"/><ref name="opentointerpretation">{{cite web | date=2005 | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Interview—Conducted by GanGan | url=http://www.ffinsider.net/advent-children/interview3.php | publisher=Final Fantasy Insider | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="sheila2">{{cite web | author=Khosla, Sheila | date=2005 | title=The Second Coming | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=109&more=1 | publisher=FLAREgamer | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=May 2008}} Scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] explained he intended players to feel encouraged to speculate about what Cloud might be thinking in certain situations rather than be provided with actual insight into what he felt.<ref name="scifisetting"/><ref name="development3"/> The game's ending left the fate of the characters ambiguous until the release of ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]'' in 2005,<ref name="development12">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania Ω | pages=191 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-88787-021-3}}</ref><ref name="rpgamer">{{cite web | author=Alley, Jake | title=Final Fantasy VII—Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7/reviews/ff7strev1.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> but the ultimate fate of humanity remained unclear nonetheless.

The game's release in North America was preceded by a massive three-month marketing campaign, for which Sony allocated a US$100 million budget. The high-profile campaign consisted of three 30-second television commercials on major networks, a holiday promotion with [[Pepsi]], and printed ads in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]].<ref name="development14">{{cite web | date=August , 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_August_27/ai_19701566 | title=PlayStation's Final Fantasy VII Marketing Blitz Continues | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="development15">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy 7 Commercial Screenshots | url=http://www.ffshrine.org/ff7/ff7_commercial1_page1.php | publisher=Final Fantasy Shrine|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=May 2008}} In 1998, ''Final Fantasy VII'' was [[porting|ported]] to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[personal computer|PCs]]. This re-release featured smoother graphics and fixed certain translation and spelling errors, as well as various gameplay-related glitches. However, the PC version also suffered from its own bugs, including errors in the display of some full motion videos when rendering in hardware mode on certain graphics chipsets.<ref name="development16">{{cite web | date=June 1998 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_June_25/ai_50113699 | title=Eidos and SquareSoft Announce the Release of Final Fantasy VII for the PC | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="development17">{{cite web | author=Olafson, Peter | date=2000 | title=Review: Final Fantasy VII for PC | url=http://www.gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/824.shtml | publisher=[GamePro]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

==Audio==
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy VII}}
The soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy VII'' was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Instead of recorded music and sound effects for the game, Uematsu opted for [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDIs]], using the PlayStation's own internal [[sound chip]]. He has explained he chose this method because it allowed the console's CPU to process audio data quicker, which in turn allowed it to focus more on processing the game's 3D engine and to prevent noticeable load times. The game was originally intended to feature a [[vocal music|vocal piece]], but this was cut due to the limitations imposed by recorded audio. However, a song with synthesized choral backing is heard in "[[One-Winged Angel]]".

The game's soundtrack was commercially released on four [[compact disc]]s;<ref name="soundtrack">{{cite web | author=Square Enix North America site staff | title=SQUARE ENIX MUSIC | url=http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/ff7.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060717233408/http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/ff7.html | archivedate=2006-07-17 | publisher=Square Enix North America | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="soundtrack2">{{cite web | author=Schweitzer, Ben & Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII OST | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]]|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> a single-disc album of selected tracks from the Original Soundtrack and three selected [[arrangement|arranged]] tracks, entitled "''[[Final Fantasy VII: Reunion Tracks]]''", was released separately.<ref name="reuniontracks">{{cite web | author=Square Enix North America site staff | title=SQUARE ENIX MUSIC | url=http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/reunion.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061109062521/http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/reunion.html | archivedate=2006-11-09 | publisher=Square Enix North America | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="reuniontracks2">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7reunion/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> A piano-only arrangement of selected tracks was also produced,<ref name="pianotracks">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7piano/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> and several remixed versions of tracks from the game have surfaced in subsequent Square productions, including ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children''<ref name="actracks">{{cite web | author=Castro Juan | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/656/656519p2.html | publisher=[[IGN]]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="actracks2">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children OST | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ac/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> and ''Kingdom Hearts''.<ref name="khtracks">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Kingdom Hearts -Final Mix- Additional Tracks | url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/khfm/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

==Reception==

''Final Fantasy VII'' was both a critical and commercial success, and set several sales records. Within three days of its January 1997 release in Japan, the game had sold 2.3 million copies. This popularity inspired thousands of retailers in North America to break [[street date]]s in September to meet public demand for the title.<ref name="streetdates">{{cite web | date=September , 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Sept_4/ai_19720780 | title=Retailers Nationwide Break Official Release Date of PlayStation's "Final Fantasy VII" Videogame | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> In the game's debut weekend in North America, it sold 330,000 copies,<ref name="330k">{{cite web | date=September 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Sept_9/ai_19749216 | title=PlayStation's "Final Fantasy VII" Breaks Industry Records in Debut Weekend | publisher=Find Articles]; originally published in [[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> and had reached sales of 500,000 units in less than three weeks.<ref name="500k">{{cite web | date=September , 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Sept_25/ai_19781799 | title=PlayStation's Final Fantasy VII Has Sold More Than Half a Million Copies to Date | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> The momentum built in the game's opening weeks continued for several months; Sony announced the game had sold one million copies on the continent by early December,<ref name="1mil">{{cite web | date=December 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Dec_4/ai_20033866 | title=Final Fantasy VII For PlayStation Hits Million-Unit Mark | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> prompting one business analyst to comment, "Sony redefined the role-playing game (RPG) category and expanded the conventional audience with the launch of ''Final Fantasy VII''".<ref name="1mil"/> <!--As of March {{vgy|2006}}, the game has sold more than 9.72 million copies worldwide, earning it the position of the best-selling ''Final Fantasy'' title.

Although Square's announcement that ''Final Fantasy VII'' would be produced for Sony rather than Nintendo and that it would not be based on the ''Final Fantasy SGI'' demo was initially met with discontent among gamers,<ref name="development6"/><ref name="development7"/> the game continues to maintain a strong following.

===Critical response===
{{Globalize/US}}
The game received extremely favorable reviews from many well-known gaming publications. [[GameFan magazine|GameFan]] called it "quite possibly the greatest game ever made", while [[GameSpot]] commented "never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined as well as in ''Final Fantasy VII''", expressing particular favor toward the game's graphics, audio and story. The UK-based publication ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' gave the game a 9/10,<ref name="edge">{{cite web | author=Edge Online site staff | title=Edge Online: Search Results | url=http://www.edge-online.co.uk/edgedb/search.php?gamename=Final+Fantasy+VII&x=0&y=0 | publisher=Edge Online|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> and ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' granted a 9.5/10, claiming "No other RPG can pull off a cinematic experience like Final Fantasy VII".<ref name="egmreview"/> At the time of release, multimedia website [[IGN]] insisted ''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s "graphics are light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation", held its plot "is deep … and epic", and regarded its battle system as its strongest point.<ref name="ignreview"/> One [[RPGamer]] staff reviewer praised the game's soundtrack "both in variety and sheer volume", suggesting that "Uematsu has done his work exceptionally well" and "is perhaps at his best here".<ref name="rpgamer2">{{cite web | author=Castomel | title=Final Fantasy VII—Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7/reviews/ff7strev3.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy VII'' has received negative criticism as well. [[GameSpy]] rated it seventh on their "25 Most Overrated Games" list in September 2003, saying, "Most ''FF'' aficionados will tell you ''VII'', while very good, is hardly the best game in the series", two of the reviewers placing both ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' above it.<ref name="GameSpy">{{cite web | author=Gamespy site staff | title=Top 25 Most Overrated Games | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/september03/25overrated/index20.shtml | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> While giving the game an overall 5/5, ''[[Official PlayStation Magazine|Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' questioned the game's highly linear progression,<ref name="opmreview">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy VII PS Review | url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3111181&did=3 | publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> as did GameSpot.<ref name="gamespotreview"/> ''OPM'' considered the game's translation "a bit muddy, causing unnecessary confusion and clouding the fine story", sentiments echoed by one member of RPGamer's staff who suggested "[the game] is far from perfect", citing its translation as "packed with typos and other errors which further obscure what is already a very confusing plot".<ref name="rpgamer"/> [[GamePro]] also considered the [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-to-[[English language|English]] translation a significant weakness in the game,<ref name="development17"/> and IGN regarded the option to use only three characters at a time as "the game's only shortcoming".<ref name="ignreview"/> Overall, the game has earned a 92% universal approval rating from critics on [[Metacritic]] and [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | editor=Metacritic site staff | title=Final Fantasy VII Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psx/finalfantasy7?q=Final%20Fantasy%20VII | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="gamerankings">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy VII Reviews | editor=Game Ratings site staff | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/197341.asp?q=Final%20Fantasy%20VII | publisher=[[Game Rankings]] | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref>

The game has also been the subject of criticism from parents concerned with violence in video games, particularly in the wake of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999. Following the event, several parents of children murdered in the massacre filed a US$5 billion lawsuit against companies that published and developed video and computer games. Among the co-defendants were [[Eidos Interactive]], publisher of the PC version of the game, with ''Final Fantasy VII'' cited as their offending contribution.<ref name="lawsuit">{{cite web | date=June , 2001 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_20010605/ai_n11965987 | title=Massacre parents sue London Lara firm | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[Evening Standard]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=May 2008}}<ref name="lawsuit2">{{cite web | date=June 2001 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010607/ai_n14390475 | title=School massacre families to sue creators of violent games | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[The Independent]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

===Legacy===

''Final Fantasy VII'' is regarded as one of the most influential titles in the history of video games. It is credited with allowing console RPGs to find a place in markets outside Japan, and remains arguably the most popular title in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="mainstream"/><ref name="mainstream2"/> In January 2005, it was selected by ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' as 6<sup>th</sup> on their list of "the 10 most important games … that helped redefine the industry since … 1989". Citing its "beautiful cut-scenes and a deep, introspective narrative", they claimed that "Square’s game was … the first RPG to surpass, instead of copy, movie-like storytelling."<ref name="egmclaim">{{cite web | date=January 2005 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdegm/is_200501/ai_n7182265 | title=10 the 10 Most Important Games | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[1UP.com]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> In late 2007, ''[[Dengeki PlayStation]]'' named ''Final Fantasy VII'' as the best story, best RPG, and best overall game in their retrospective awards feature about the original [[PlayStation]].<ref name="dengeki-awards">{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=2007-11-22 | title=Nomura Talks FFXIII | url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/837/837350p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

The game's popularity and open-ended nature also led the director and writer to establish a plot-related connection between ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', another popular ''Final Fantasy'' title.<ref name="development12"/> It has also inspired an [[Final Fantasy VII (Famicom)|unofficial version of ''Final Fantasy VII'']] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Famicom]] by Chinese company Shenzhen Nanjing Technology.<ref name="NESFFVII">{{cite web|url= http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/22/final-fantasy-vii-ported-to-the-famicom-finally/|title=Final Fantasy VII ported to the Famicom.

The game's legacy includes the acceptance and standard inclusion of full-motion video sequences in RPGs, as well as significant advancement in computer graphics. These developments would allow series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to begin production of the first ''Final Fantasy'' film, ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]''.<ref name="spiritswithin">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Kennedy, Sam & Steinman, Gary | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=90 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}</ref> The game also introduced settings dominantly suffused with modern-to-advanced technology into the ''Final Fantasy'' series, a theme continued by ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and ''The Spirits Within''.<ref name="scifisetting"/><ref name="scifi"/><ref name="scifi2">{{cite web | author=Oliver, Glen | date=2001 | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/301/301291p1.html | title=Review of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> Re-releases of Square games in Japan with bonus features would occur frequently after the release of ''Final Fantasy VII International''.
