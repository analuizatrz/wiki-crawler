==History==
Legendary [[Seattle]] [[businessman]] Joël Eisenberg was the founder and owner of Aeroamerica, Inc.<ref name="ITL">[http://www.itltd.net/mission.html ITL International Telecom Ltd.

Aeroamerica commenced commercial operations in 1974 with three ex-[[Braniff Airways|Braniff]] [[Boeing 720]] [[jetliners]].<ref name="World_Airline_Directory_75"/> Aeroamerica's Boeing 720s were configured in a 149-seat, single-class seating arrangement.<ref name="Annual_Report_74">''Berlin Airport Company - Summary of 1974 Annual Report, February 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975</ref> Although the colour scheme applied to all of these aircraft featured the same basic shapes, the actual colour combination was different for each individual plane.<ref name="May_75">''Berlin Airport Company, May 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975</ref>

In late October 1974 the newly formed airline stationed its first Boeing 720 at West Berlin's Tegel Airport for crew familiarisation flights.<ref name="Annual_Report_74"/> By March 1975 a further two Boeing 720s arrived at the airline's new Berlin Tegel base to fulfill a [[charter flight|charter contract]] Aeroamerica had concluded with '''Berliner Flug Ring''', at the time West Berlin's leading [[package tour]] operator, to operate a series of short- to medium-haul [[Inclusive Tour|IT]] [[charter flight]]s to the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Canary Islands]] from the start of the [[1975]] summer season.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, April 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975</ref> Aeroamerica had taken over this contract from [[Modern Air Transport|Modern Air]], another US supplemental carrier that had been based at Tegel Airport from April 1968 until October 1974.<ref name="Annual_Report_74"/> The decision to supply whole-plane [[charter airline]] seats to West Berlin's foremost package tour operator enabled the airline to take advantage of the fact that all airlines other than those headquartered in the [[United States|US]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[France]] - the airlines of the three Western victorious powers of [[World War II]] - were banned from operating at West Berlin.

By [[1976]] the size of the airline's fleet had doubled to six aircraft through the acquisition of another three second-hand [[jet aircraft|jet]]s. These included an additional Boeing 720 as well as a [[Boeing 707]]-120B and a [[BAC One-Eleven]] 400. The latter two aircraft had originally belonged to [[American Airlines]]. During the summer of 1976 Aeroamerica's entire fleet was based at Berlin Tegel, making it West Berlin's leading [[charter airline]] at the time.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, August 1976 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1976</ref>

From [[1977]] the airline's presence at [[Berlin]] gradually declined.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, May 1977 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1977</ref>

During that period the airline had also faced isolated incidents of [[labor unrest|labour unrest]] from a small but vocal minority among its local [[Germany|German]] flight attendants who opposed the [[United States|American]] management's strict non-[[trades union|union]] policy for its Berlin operation.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, May 1977 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1977</ref>

A short-term [[wet lease]] Aeroamerica had concluded with [[Kıbrıs Türk Hava Yolları|Kıbrıs Türk Hava Yolları (KTHY)]], the [[Northern Cyprus]] [[flag carrier]], in 1977, whereby a fully crewed Boeing 720 was stationed at [[Ercan airport|Ercan]] for several months to operate the Turkish carrier's scheduled route to [[Istanbul]], partially compensated for the loss of [[business]] at its Berlin base.<ref>{{cite news | title= World Airline Directory 1978 | work= [[Flight International]] | date= March 1978}}</ref>

Aeroamerica closed its Berlin base following the end of the 1979 summer season.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, April 1979 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1979</ref><ref name="World_Airline_Directory_80"/>
