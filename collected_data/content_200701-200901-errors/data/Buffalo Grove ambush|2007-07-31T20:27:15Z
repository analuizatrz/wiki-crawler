The '''Buffalo Grove massacre''' was an [[ambush]] that occurred on [[May 29]], [[1832]] as part of the [[Black Hawk War]]. A six man detail carrying dispatches from American Colonel James M. Strode at [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]] to General [[Henry Atkinson]] at [[Dixon's Ferry]] was ambushed. William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the ambush. Durley's remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the [[St. Vrain massacre]]. Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing but Durley was the only one killed. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of [[Polo, Illinois]].

==Prelude== 
When the [[Black Hawk War]] began in the spring of 1832 the settlers at Buffalo Grove were notified of [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk's]] victory at [[Battle of Stillman's Run|Stillman's Run]] and ordered to leave the grove.<ref name=leeogle>"[http://www.leeogle.org/pchs/Historical/BuffGrov.htm Buffalo Grove]," Polo Community High School, ''Lee/Ogle Regional Office of Education #47.

==Aftermath==
The events of the Buffalo Grove massacre are closely intertwined with those of the [[St. Vrain massacre]]. A group including Aaron Hawley and John Fowler, both casualties of the St. Vrain massacre, was en route to Galena when they stumbled upon the body of Durley at Buffalo Grove. The group of four men returned to Dixon's Ferry, reported their find and stayed there overnight.<ref name=stevens>Stevens, Frank E.

When Atkinson returned to Dixon on [[May 23]] it was with dispatches destined for [[Fort Armstrong]]. He ordered [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Agent]] [[Felix St. Vrain]] to join the group who had discovered Durley's body and travel with them to Galena.<ref name=stevens/> The group left Dixon and traveled north where they found, and interred the remains of Durley at Buffalo Grove.<ref name=wisc>"[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/diary/002832.asp The Killing of Felix St. Vrain]," Historic Diaries: Black Hawk War, ''Wisconsin Historical Society''.

The Polo Historical Society erected a memorial to Durley on [[May 19]], [[1910]], the 78th anniversary of the massacre. At that time, Durley's remains were moved from where St. Vrain's party buried him, where he had fallen, and interred beneath the memorial.<ref name=leeogle/><ref name=marker/> The Buffalo Grove massacre historical marker and memorial to Durley are located west of the city of [[Polo, Illinois]] along Eagle Point Road.<ref name=marker>"[http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/ppld&CISOPTR=15&CISOBOX=1&REC=1 William Durley Monument]," Illinois Digital Archives, ''Illinois Secretary of State/State Librarian'', to access ([[PDF]]) click access this item.
