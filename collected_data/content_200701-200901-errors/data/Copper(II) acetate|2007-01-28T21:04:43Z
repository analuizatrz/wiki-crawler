'''Copper(II) acetate''', also referred to as '''cupric acetate''', is [[Cu]]<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> where AcO<sup>-</sup> is [[acetate]] (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>). The [[hydrated]] version contains two water molecules and is the form most commonly available commercially.  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> is a dark green [[crystalline]] solid, whereas Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> is more bluish-green.  Since ancient times, copper acetates of some form have been used as [[fungicide]]s and green [[pigment]]s.  Today, Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> is used as a source of copper(II) in inorganic synthesis and as a [[catalyst]] or an [[oxidizing agent]] in [[organic synthesis]].

==History==
Copper(II) acetate is speculated to be a component of [[verdigris]], the blue-green substance that forms on copper during long exposures to atmosphere.  It was historically prepared in vineyards, since [[acetic acid]] is a byproduct of [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]].   Copper sheets were alternately layered with fermented grape skins and [[dregs]] left over from wine production and exposed to air.  This would leave a blue substance on the outside of the sheet.  This was then scraped off and dissolved in water.  The resulting solid was used as a pigment, or combined with [[arsenic trioxide]] to form [[copper acetoarsenite]], a powerful [[insecticide]] and fungicide called [[Paris Green|Paris]] or Schwienfurt green.

==Uses in chemical synthesis==
The uses for copper(II) acetate are more plentiful as a catalyst or [[oxidizing agent]] in organic syntheses.  For example, Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> is used to couple two terminal [[alkynes]] to make a 1,3-[[diyne]]:<ref>P. Vogel, J. Srogl "Copper(II) Acetate" in "EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis" Copper(II) Acetate, 2005 John Wiley & Sons.</ref>
:Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>  +  2 RC≡CH  →  2 CuOAc  +  RC≡C-C≡CR  +  2 HOAc
The reaction proceeds via the intermediacy of [[copper(I) acetylide]]s, which are then oxidized by the copper(II) acetate, releasing the acetylide radical.  A related reaction involving copper acetylides is the synthesis of [[ynamines]], terminal alkynes with amine groups using Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>.<sup>[2]</sup>

==Structure==
[[Image:Copper-acetate-dimer-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|The dinuclear structure of copper(II) acetate]]
Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> adopts the "Chinese lantern" structure seen also for related Rh(II) and Cr(II) tetraacetates.<ref>van Niekerk, J. N. Schoening, F. R. L. “X-Ray Evidence for Metal-to-Metal Bonds in Cupric and Chromous Acetate” Nature 1953, volume 171, pages 36-37. doi:10.1038/171036a0.</ref><ref>Wells, A.F. (1984). Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref>    One oxygen atom on each acetate is bound to one copper at 1.97 [[Å]].  Completing the coordination sphere are two water ligands, with Cu-O distances of 2.20 Å.  The two five-coordinate copper atoms are separated by only 2.65 Å, which is close to the Cu--Cu separation in metallic copper.<sup>[5]</sup>.  The two copper centers interact resulting in a diminishing of the magnetic moment such that near 90K, Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> is essentially diamagnetic due to cancellation of the two opposing spins.  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> was a critical step in the development of modern theories for [[antiferromagnetic]] coupling.<ref>R. L. Carlin "Magnetochemistry" Springer: Berlin, 1986</ref>

== Synthesis==
Copper(II) acetate has been synthesized for centuries by the method described in the history section.  This method, however, leads to a fairly impure mixture of copper(II) acetate and the other components of verdigris.  In a laboratory, a much purer form can be synthesized in a simple three-step procedure. The overall reaction is as follows:<sup>[6]</sup>
:CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub>  +  4 CH<sub>3</sub>COOH  →  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>  +  (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
(note that CuSO<sub>4</sub>, "copper sulfate" is also typically hydrated).

The hydrate form can be dehydrated by heating at 100 °C in a vacuum:<ref> S. J. Kirchner, Q. Fernando "Copper(I) Acetate" Inorganic Syntheses, 1980, volume XX, pages 53-55.</ref>
:Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>  →  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O
Heating a mixture of anhydrous Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> and copper metal affords colorless, volatile cuprous acetate:
:2 Cu  +  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>  →  4 Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>2</sub>  +  4 HOAc
