'''Alberta''' ({{IPAEng|ælˈbɝtə}}) is one of [[Canada|Canada's]] [[Canadian Prairies|prairie]] [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]]. It became a province on [[September 1]], [[1905]].

Alberta is located in [[western Canada]], bounded by the provinces of [[British Columbia]] to the west and [[Saskatchewan]] to the east, [[Northwest Territories]] to the north, and by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]] to the south. Alberta is one of three provinces and territories (the others being [[New Brunswick]] and [[Yukon]]) to border only a single U.S. state.  It is also one of two provinces that are land-locked (the other being Saskatchewan).

The [[capital city]] of Alberta is [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], located just south of the centre of the province. [[Calgary]] is a major distribution and transportation hub as well as being one of Canada's major commerce centres. Edmonton is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's [[Athabasca Oil Sands|oil sands]] and other northern resource industries. According to recent population estimates, these two metropolitan areas have now both exceeded 1 million people, Calgary being slightly more populous than Edmonton.<ref>[http://www40.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/getcans/sorth.cgi?lan=eng&dtype=fina&filename=demo05a.htm&sortact=2&sortf=6 Statistics Canada—CMA population estimates]</ref> Other [[List of communities in Alberta|municipalities in the province]] include [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], [[Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]], [[Fort McMurray, Alberta|Fort McMurray]], [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], [[Lloydminster]], [[Wetaskiwin, Alberta|Wetaskiwin]], [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Cold Lake, Alberta|Cold Lake]], and [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]].

Since [[December 14]], [[2006]], the [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] of the province is Hon. [[Ed Stelmach]], [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]].

Alberta is named after [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise Caroline Alberta]] (1848–1939), the fourth daughter of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]. Princess Louise was the wife of the [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]],  [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1878 to 1883. [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]], the village of [[Caroline, Alberta|Caroline]], and [[Mount Alberta]] were also named in honour of Princess Louise.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Alberta}}
Alberta is in [[western Canada]], and covers an area of 661,190&nbsp;km² (255,287 mi²).<ref name=area>{{Cite web| url= http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/phys01.htm | title= Land and freshwater area, by province and territory | author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | year= 2005 | month= February | accessdate= 2007-03-07}}</ref> To the south, it borders the U.S. state of Montana on the [[49th parallel north|49th Parallel]]. To the east at a longitude of 110° west, it borders the province of Saskatchewan. At 60° north, it is bordered by the Northwest Territories. To the west, its border with [[British Columbia]] follows the line of peaks of the [[Rocky Mountains]] range along the [[Continental Divide]], which runs northwesterly until it reaches 120° west, at which point the border follows this meridian to 60° north.

With the exception of the southeastern section, the province is well watered. Alberta contains dozens of rivers and lakes used for [[swimming]], [[water skiing]], [[fishing]] and a full range of other [[water sports]]. There are three large lakes and a multitude of smaller lakes less than 260&nbsp;km² each. Part of [[Lake Athabasca]] ({{nts|7898}}&nbsp;km²) lies in the province of Saskatchewan. [[Lake Claire (Albertan lake)|Lake Claire]] ({{nts|1436}}&nbsp;km²) lies just west of Lake Athabasca in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]]. [[Lesser Slave Lake]] ({{nts|1168}}&nbsp;km²) is northwest of [[Edmonton]].

[[Image:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Moraine Lake]] in [[Banff National Park]]]]
Because Alberta extends for {{nts|1200}}&nbsp;km from north to south, and about 600&nbsp;km wide at its greatest east-west extent, it is natural that the climate should vary considerably between the 49th and 60th parallels. It is also further influenced by its elevation since the province is a high plateau. The elevation ranges from about {{nts|1000}} metres in the south (Calgary is about {{nts|1100}} metres and Red Deer is about 850 m) to 650 metres in the north. The presence of a wall of mountains on the west and open prairies on the east also influences the weather.

Northern Alberta is mostly covered by [[taiga|boreal forest]] and has fewer frost-free days than southern Alberta, which has a semi-arid climate. The southeastern corner of Alberta experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains, and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter [[chinook wind]]s, while southeastern Alberta is a generally flat, dry prairie with some hills, where temperatures are most extreme. They can range from very cold (−35&nbsp;°C (−31&nbsp;°F) or lower in the winter) to very hot (38&nbsp;°C (100&nbsp;°F) or higher in the summer). Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely [[aspen parkland]], a [[biome]] transitional between [[prairie]] to the south and boreal forest to the north. After southern [[Ontario]], Central Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience [[tornadoes]]. [[Thunderstorm]]s, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is notable for having the highest frequency of [[hail]] in Canada, due to the role of orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains which enhances the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

Overall, Alberta has cold winters, with a temperature average ranging from −10&nbsp;°C (14&nbsp;°F) in the south to −24&nbsp;°C (−12&nbsp;°F) in the north. In the south along the foothills of the Rockies, the winter cold is sometimes interrupted by [[Chinook winds]] which can propel temperatures upward in a short time frame close to or infrequently above 20&nbsp;°C (68&nbsp;°F). These conditions most commonly occur in February or March. In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around 21&nbsp;°C (70&nbsp;°F) in the Rocky Mountains (valleys) and far north to near 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F) in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting over periods of years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation. Alberta experiences a good amount of sunshine for its northern location owing to its fairly dry climate; the east-central part of the province (bordering Saskatchewan), is the sunniest place in Canada with an average of over {{nts|2500}} hours a year.

</div>

Alberta's capital city, [[Edmonton]], is located almost in the geographic centre of the province, and most of Alberta's oil is [[refinery|refined]] here. Southern Alberta, where Calgary is located, is known for its [[ranching]]. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to [[grain]] or to [[dairy farming]], with ranching and [[grasslands]] predominant in the south.

The Alberta [[badlands]] are located in southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep [[gorge]]s and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Brooks, Alberta]], showcases the badlands terrain, [[desert]] [[flora (plants)|flora]], and remnants from Alberta's past when [[dinosaurs]] roamed the then lush landscape.

Alberta is one of only two Canadian provinces to have no maritime coast (the other being the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan.)

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Alberta}}

Alberta's economy is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. The per capita GDP in 2006 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]69,789. This was 56% higher than the national average and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. This deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.statcan.ca/english/ads/11-010-XPB/pdf/sep06.pdf |author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | title= The Alberta economic Juggernaut:The boom on the rose| month= September |year= 2006| accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>

The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).<ref name="CECorridor">{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=[[2003-01-20]]|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor is 10 percent above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40 percent above other Canadian cities.

According to the [[Fraser Institute]], Alberta also has very high levels of [[economic freedom]]. It is by far the most free economy in Canada,<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=nr&id=633 | title= Alberta Rated as Best Investment Climate | author= The Fraser Institute | authorlink= Fraser Institute| year= 2006| month= November | accessdate= 2007-03-02}}</ref> and is rated as the 4th most free economy of U.S. States and Canadian Provinces.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=pb&id=855 | title= Economic Freedom of North America. 2006 Annual Report| author= The Fraser Institute | authorlink= Fraser Institute| year= 2006| month=September | accessdate= 2007-03-02}} ISBN 0-88975-213-3</ref>

=== Industry ===
[[Image:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] ]]
{{No wrap}}Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.<ref>Government of Alaksa. [http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm Alaska and Alberta - An Overview]</ref> Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in [[North America]] are located in central and north central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, world class [[polyethylene]] and [[vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical]] industry to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[non-conventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254&nbsp;km³). With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about 315 billion barrels (50&nbsp;km³) of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing  cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.<ref>[http://www.buyusa.gov/montana/canadaoilsands.html Canada Oilsands Opportunites -- U.S. Commercial Service Montana<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the Tar Sands is the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive [[liquid crystal display]] systems.<ref>[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html Interactive display system]—US Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263; [http://www2.smarttech.com/st/en-US/About+Us/News+Room/Media+Releases/2002+Media+Releases.htm?guid=%7BB3BD6857-5D25-4EC7-A741-C0232368F5FE%7D U.S. Patent for Touch Sensitive Technology]—SMART Technologies</ref> With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

=== Agriculture and forestry ===

[[Image:Field 150.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Canola]] field in [[central Alberta]]]]

[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another,<ref>[http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 Alberta Livestock Inspections—August 2006]—Alberta Government, Department of Agriculture</ref> and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|mutton]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].

[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Grain elevator in [[southern Alberta]]]]

[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] canola also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.

The vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].

== Government ==
{{main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}

The government of Alberta is organized as a [[parliamentary]] [[democracy]] with a unicameral legislature.  Its [[unicameral]] legislature—the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]]—consists of eighty-three members.

Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately.  Their boundaries may or may not coincide.  Municipalities where the same body acted as both local government and school board are formally referred to as "counties" in Alberta.

As Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor, Norman Kwong.  Although the Lieutenant Governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, (s)he is in reality a [[figurehead]] whose actions are restricted by custom and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]].  The government is therefore headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]]. The current Premier is Ed Stelmach who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on [[December 2]], [[2006]].  Stelmach was sworn in as the 13th [[Alberta premier]] on [[December 15]], [[2006]]. [[Image:Edmonton leg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Alberta's Legislative Building in Edmonton.]]

As is always the case in a parliamentary system of government, the Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and he draws all the members of his Cabinet from among the Members of the Legislative Assembly.

The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of Alberta.

The province's revenue comes mainly from the taxation of oil, natural gas, beef, softwood lumber, and wheat, but also includes a tax on corporate and personal income, gaming revenue, and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for [[infrastructure]] projects. Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]]). Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.

Alberta's elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces. Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives ("Conservatives" or "Tories"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]. A fourth party, the strongly conservative [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta. In fact, only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.

As is the case with many western Canadian provinces, Alberta has had occasional surges in separatist sentiment. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums. There are a number of groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province. See also: [[Alberta separatism]].

In the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 provincial election]], held on [[March 3]], [[2008]], the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the [[Alberta Liberal Party]] was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and the [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] elected two members.<ref>  [http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/ Election results at CTV]</ref>

== Education ==
{{main|Education in Alberta}}
[[Image:SAIT Heart Building 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Heritage Hall at [[SAIT Polytechnic]] ]]
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).

; K–12

There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] electorate, and one ([[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]) has a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.

For many years the [[Government of Alberta|provincial government]] has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K–12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K–12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K–12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.

[[Public school|Public]] and separate school boards, [[charter school]]s, and [[private school]]s all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies.  Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.

; Post-secondary

Alberta's oldest and largest university is Edmonton's [[University of Alberta]]. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966, and is now the second largest university in Alberta. There is also [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]]. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology|NAIT]] and [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology|SAIT]].<ref>[http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/college/postsecsystem/postsecinst/postsecinst.asp Post Secondary Education]</ref>   There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, including [[DeVry University]]. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier Ralph Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.<ref>[http://www.su.ualberta.ca/su/student_government/advocacy/ University of Alberta—Ralph Klein promises tuition freeze]</ref>  So far, no plan has been released by the government of Alberta.

[[Image:DavidThompsonHighway.JPG|left|thumb|200px| David Thompson Highway outside of [[Banff National Park]]]]
Alberta has over 180,000&nbsp;km of [[highway]]s and roads, of which nearly 50,000&nbsp;km are paved. The main north-south [[corridor]] is [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]], which begins south of [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] at the [[Carway, Alberta|Carway]] border crossing and is part of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]]. [[Alberta Highway 4|Highway 4]], which effectively extends [[Interstate 15|U.S. Interstate Highway 15]] into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the [[Coutts, Alberta|Coutts]] border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway 3]] joins Lethbridge to [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]] and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton before dividing into two highways. The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the [[Queen Elizabeth II Highway]] to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005. Past Edmonton, one branch continues northwest as [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] into Grande Prairie and the [[Peace River Country]]; the other ([[Alberta Highway 63|Highway 63]]) travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the [[Athabasca Tar Sands|Athabasca Oil Sands]]. Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: [[Alberta Highway 22|Highway 22]], west of highway 2, known as "the cowboy trail," and [[Alberta Highway 21|Highway 21]], east of highway 2.

Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through [[Banff National Park]]. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network but known alternatively as the [[Yellowhead Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 16|Highway 16]]), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and [[Jasper National Park]] into [[British Columbia]]. On a sunny spring or fall day, one of the most scenic drives is along the [[Icefields Parkway]], which runs for 228&nbsp;km between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.

[[Image:Alberta License Plate 2005.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Current [[Vehicle registration plates of Alberta|Current Alberta licence plate]]]]
Another major corridor through central Alberta is [[Alberta Highway 11|Highway 11]] (also known as the [[David Thompson]] Highway), which runs west from the [[Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta|Saskatchewan River Crossing]] in Banff National Park through [[Rocky Mountain House]] and [[Red Deer]], connecting with [[Alberta Highway 12|Highway 12]] 20&nbsp;km west of [[Stettler]].  The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and [[freeway]]s are often called ''trails''. For example, Highway 2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called [[Deerfoot Trail]] as it passes through Calgary, but becomes [[Calgary Trail]] as it enters Edmonton and then turns into Saint Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the city of [[Saint Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban [[expressway]]s ''trails'' and naming many of them after prominent [[first nations]] individuals and tribes, such as [[Crowchild Trail]], [[Deerfoot Trail]], and [[Stoney Trail]]. Visitors from outside Alberta often find this disconcerting, as they expect a trail to be an unpaved route intended primarily for [[pedestrian]]s and not a multi-lane expressway.

{{seealso|List of Alberta provincial highways}}

Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial [[public transit]] systems. In addition to buses, Edmonton and Calgary operate [[light rail transit]] (LRT) systems. [[Edmonton LRT]], which is largely underground, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary [[C-Train]], although it operates almost entirely on the surface, has the highest ridership of any LRT system in North America.

Alberta is well-connected by air, with [[international airport]]s at both Edmonton and Calgary. [[Calgary International Airport]] and [[Edmonton International Airport]] are the fourth and fifth [[Canada's busiest airport|busiest in Canada]] respectively. Calgary's [[airport]] is a hub for [[WestJet|WestJet Airlines]] and a regional hub for [[Air Canada]]. Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, and four destinations in [[Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref>[http://www.yyc.com/ Calgary International Airport]</ref>  Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.

{{seealso|List of airports in Alberta}}

There are over 9000&nbsp;km of operating mainline railway, and many tourists see Alberta aboard [[Via Rail]] or ''Rocky Mountain Railtours''. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] companies operate railway [[freight]] across the province.

[[Health care]] in Alberta is divided into nine [[Health regions of Canada|health regions]]: [[Aspen Regional Health Authority]]: [[Calgary Health Region]], [[Capital Health]] (Edmonton), [[Chinook Health]], [[David Thompson Regional Health Authority]], [[East Central Health]], [[Northern Lights Health Region]], [[Palliser Health Region]] and [[Peace Country Health Region]].

== Culture ==

[[Image:StampedeRodeo2002.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Calgary Stampede]]]]

{{main|Culture of Alberta}}

Summer brings many festivals to the province. The [[Edmonton Fringe Festival]] is the world's second largest after [[Edinburgh]]'s. The folk music festivals in both Calgary and Edmonton are two of Canada's largest and both cities host a number of annual multicultural events. With a large number of summer and winter events, Edmonton prides itself as being the "Festival City". The city's [[Edmonton Heritage Festival|"heritage days" festival]] sees the participation of over 70 national groups. Calgary is also home to [[Carifest]], the second largest Caribbean festival in the nation (after [[Caribana]] in [[Toronto]]). The city is also famous for its [[Calgary Stampede]], dubbed "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth." The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, like calf roping and bull riding. These events highlight the province's cultural diversity and love of entertainment. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the [[Francis Winspear Centre for Music]].

{{seealso|Festivals in Alberta}}

Alberta also has significant ethnic diversity. Both the [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] and [[Indo-Canadian|East Indian]] communities are significant. According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of [[Francophones]] in western Canada (after [[Manitoba]]). Many of [[Franco-Albertan|Alberta's French-speaking residents]] live in the central and northwestern regions of the province. As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population and East Indians represented better than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have [[Chinatown]]s and Calgary's is Canada's third largest. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s.  [[Aboriginal peoples in Alberta|Aboriginal Albertans]] make up approximately three percent of the population.

The major contributors to Alberta's ethnic diversity have been the European nations.<ref name="statcan2001" /> Forty-four percent of Albertans are of [[British people|British]] and [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] descent, and there are also large numbers of [[German Canadian|Germans]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainians]] and [[Scandinavia]]ns. Amongst those of British origins, the [[Scottish Canadian|Scots]] have had a particularly strong influence, with many place-names (including Calgary, [[Airdrie]], [[Canmore]] and [[Banff]]) having [[Scotland|Scottish]] origins.

Both cities are home to [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Hockey League]] teams. [[Association football|Soccer]], [[rugby union]] and [[lacrosse]] are also played professionally in Alberta.

Alberta is home to speakers of a number of languages, with many minority languages growing due to immigration. English remains the only official language used in all government services, although French is also an official language of the courts.

== Tourism ==

[[Image:Stephen Avenue.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Stephen Avenue]], Calgary.]]

{{main|Tourism in Alberta}}

Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as [[West Edmonton Mall]], outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the [[Commonwealth Games]] and [[Olympic Games]], as well as more eclectic attractions.

According to Alberta Economic Development, Edmonton and Calgary both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.<ref>Alberta Economic Development. [http://www.alberta-canada.com/statpub/tourismStatistics/tdr.cfm/ Tourism Statistics]</ref>

[[Image:Lake Louise 17092005.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]] in the [[Canadian Rockies]]]]
Alberta's Rocky Mountains include well known tourist destinations [[Banff National Park]] and [[Jasper National Park]]. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic [[Icefields Parkway]]. Banff is located 128&nbsp;km west of Calgary on [[Alberta Highway 1|Highway 1]] and Jasper is located 366&nbsp;km west of Edmonton on [[Yellowhead Highway]]. 5 of Canada's 13 [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage site]]s are located within the province: [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks]], [[Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park]], [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] and [[Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump]].  

About 1.2 million people pass through the gates of Calgary's world-famous Stampede,<ref>[http://www.stampede.coolattractions.com/history.html Calgary Stampede highlights]</ref> a celebration of Canada's own [[Wild West]] and the cattle ranching industry. About 800,000 people enjoy Edmonton's [[Capital Ex]] (formerly Klondike Days).<ref>[http://capitalex.ca/history.html CapitalEX]—Fair History</ref> Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the [[Yukon]] [[gold field]]s, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous [[Chilkoot Pass]].

Another tourist destination that draws more than 650 000 visitors a year is the Drumheller Valley, located 86 miles N.E. of Calgary. Drumheller, "Dinosaur Capital of The World", offers the Royal Tyrrell Musuem of Palaeontology, one of the worlds finest dinosaur museums. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years and can offer days of interesting attractions to those that venture to take a look. A good place to start would be the tourist info centre where the worlds largest dinosaur stands guard at a height of 26.2 metres as it peers down the valley overseeing the many other replicas situated throughout the valley. The Canadian Badlands has much to offer in the way of attractions, cultural events, celebrations, accommodations and service. A unique oasis on the prarie.   Drumheller "Something to Roar About".

Located in East-Central Alberta is [[Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions]], a popular tourist attraction operated out of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]] that draws visitors from around the world. It boasts one of the few operable steam trains in the world, offering trips through the rolling prairie scenery. Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.

Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to [[skiing|ski]] and [[hiking|hike]]; Alberta boasts several world-class [[ski resort]]s such as [[Sunshine Village]], [[Lake Louise Mountain Resort|Lake Louise]], [[Marmot Basin]], [[Mount Norquay ski resort|Norquay]] and [[Nakiska]]. Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive [[trophy|trophies]] and [[tall tales]] from their experiences in Alberta's wilderness.

== Demographics ==

[[Image:Alberta population.svg|thumb|250px|right|Alberta's population has grown steadily for over a century.]]

{{main|Demographics of Alberta}}

Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, due in large part to its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province saw high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as [[British Columbia]]), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.<ref>[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm StatCan—Alberta population]</ref>
Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas.

== History ==

[[Image:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Alexander Rutherford]], Alberta's first premier]]

{{main|History of Alberta}}

The  province of Alberta, as far north as about 53° north latitude, was a part of [[Rupert's Land]] from the time of the incorporation of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (1670). After the arrival in the North-West of the French around 1731 they settled the prairies of the west, establishing communities such as [[Lac La Biche, Alberta|Lac La Biche]] and [[Bonnyville, Alberta|Bonnyville]]. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in (1752). The [[North West Company]] of Montreal occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson's Bay Company arrived from Hudson Bay to take possession of it. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who, on behalf of the North West Company of Montreal, built [[Fort Athabasca]] on Lac La Biche in 1778. [[Roderick Mackenzie]] built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the [[Athabasca River]], which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the [[Mackenzie River]]—which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the [[Pacific Ocean]], and so being the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=36643|title=Alexander Mackenzie Biography|author=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|accessdate=2006-01-05}}</ref>

The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] as the first premier.

== Ecology ==
=== Fauna ===

The three climatic regions ([[Alpine climate|alpine]], forest, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback, and thrive on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

[[Image:Ovis canadensis 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Bighorn Sheep]] is Alberta's provincial animal]]

Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[Grizzly bear|grizzly]] and [[American Black Bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[Canidae|canine]] and [[feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]], [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[mountain lion]] (cougar).

[[Herbivorous]], or plant-eating animals, are found throughout the province. [[Moose]] and [[deer]] (both mule and white-tail [[variety (biology)|varieties]]) are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains. [[Rabbit]]s, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is fortunate in that it is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie [[rattlesnake]].

Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting-ground of the migratory birds. Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are well stocked with [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[walleye]], [[whitefish]], [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], and [[Brown trout|brown]] [[trout]], and even [[sturgeon]]. [[Turtle]]s are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. [[Frog]]s and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.

Alberta is the only province in Canada, as well as one of the few places in the world which is free of [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument |title = The History of Rat Control in Alberta| author=Alberta Department of Agriculture| accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref> Since the early 1950s, the government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats which have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions.

=== Flora ===

In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie crocus [[anemone]], the [[three flowered avens]], [[golden bean]], and other early flowers. The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the [[sunflower]] family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the [[prairie coneflower]], [[fleabane]], and [[Sagebrush|sage]]. Both yellow and white [[sweet clover]] fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[balsam poplar]] (or [[cottonwood]]), and [[paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species. [[Conifer]]s include [[Jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[Lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[tamarack]].
