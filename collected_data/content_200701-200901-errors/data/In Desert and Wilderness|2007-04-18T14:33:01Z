'''''In Desert and Wilderness''''' (orig. Polish ''W pustyni i w puszczy'') is a popular novel for young people by [[Poland|Polish]] author [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], written in [[1912]]. It is in fact the author's only novel written for children. It is the story of two kids, Staś Tarkowski and Nel Rawlinson, kidnapped by the rebels during [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi's]] rebellion in [[Sudan]]. It was filmed twice, in [[1973]] and in [[2001]].

Although the novel is fictional (apart from the historical events), it was inspired by real events. A Polish boy was indeed kidnapped at those times, but has never been found. An inspiration for Nel's character was the daughter of Sienkiewicz's friend.

In [[1961]], [[Marian Brandys]] published ''Śladami Stasia i Nel'' (''Following the path of Staś and Nel'')
and, in [[1962]] a related ''Z Panem Biegankiem w Abisynii'' (''In [[Abyssinia]] with Mister Bieganek'').

Władysław Ślesicki, the director of the 1973 movie released a book, ''Z Tomkiem i Moniką w pustyni i w puszczy'' (''In Desert and Wilderness with Tomek and Monika'').

In [[1993]], [[Wojciech Sambory]] (a [[pen name]] for a writing team) wrote ''Powrót do Afryki'' (''A Return to Africa''), as a [[sequel]] to the novel (published by Reporter-Oficyna Wydawnicza, ISBN 83-85189-54-8).

Comic-strip ''Nowe przygody Stasia i Nel'' (''The New Adventures of Staś and Nel'') from [http://kali.xt.pl/ Piechur] weekly magazine is another [[sequel]] to Sienkiewicz's novel. It was published online on [http://steampunk.republika.pl/ Retrostacja] in [[2005]].
