'''West Liberty Foods, [[Limited liability company|L.L.C.]]''' is a [[United States|US]] [[meat packing industry|meat processing]] company owned by the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative.  The company was formed in 1996<ref name="Young1">{{cite news |author = Young, Barbara |title = Growth Essentials. |work = National Provisioner, The |date = May 2004 }}</ref> by a group of [[Iowa]] [[Domesticated turkey|turkey]] growers,<ref name="O'Keefe">{{cite news |author = O’Keefe, Terrence |year = 2003 |title = A Slice of the Future |url = http://www.wlfoods.com/0703wp26.pdf |work = [http://www.wlfoods.com/ West Liberty Foods] |accessdate = 2006-06-30}}</ref> and now owns four meat processing plants.<ref name="Plants">{{cite web|url= http://www.wlfoods.com/about/plants.htm |title=Plants |accessmonthday= 07-05|accessyear=2007 |language=English}}</ref>  The company mainly produces [[Product (business)|products]] for [[customers]] to sell under their own [[brand]] names.<ref name="O'Keefe" /> As of 2006, West liberty Foods was the 12th largest turkey company in the United States.<ref name="O'Keefe2">{{cite news |author = O’Keefe, Terrence |url = http://www.wattpoultryusa-digital.com/wattpoultryusa/200702/?pg=64 |title = Top Turkey Company Profiles |work = Watt Poultry USA |date = February, 2007 |accessdate = 2007-07-27 }}</ref>

Each plant, located in the three Iowa towns of [[West Liberty, Iowa|West Liberty]], [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], and [[Sigourney, Iowa|Sigourney]] as well as [[Tremonton, Utah]], focuses on specific aspects of the meat packing process.  The West Liberty plant participates in the entire process by [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughtering]] animals, further processing meats into products, and [[packaging]] finished products, and the Sigourney plant focuses on the further processing step only, and the Mount Pleasant plant only packages finished product.

While West Liberty Foods has grown and received awards since its creation, it initially faced a difficult [[market]] for turkeys, and has experienced problems with labor discontent. [[Employment|Employees]] remain with the company for an average of nine years,<ref name="O'Keefe" /> with more than 1500 employed.<ref name="Young3">{{cite news |author = Young, Barbara |title = Extraordinary Chief Executive. |work = National Provisioner, The |date = January 2006}}</ref>

[[Image:WL Plant Entrance.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Main entrance to the company’s plant in [[West Liberty, Iowa]]]]
The company primarily provides meat for other [[marketing]] brands, producing 90% of its product for customers while selling only 10% under the West Liberty Foods brand name. In addition to slaughtering turkeys, the company produces prepared [[beef]], [[chicken]], [[pork]], and turkey products.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  Company [[revenue]] has grown rapidly with [[United States dollar|US$]]65 million in [[sales]] during 1997, US$120 million in 2000, and US$200 million in 2003.<ref name="O'Keefe" /><ref name="Phoenix">{{cite web|url= http://www.wlfoods.com/news/meatprocess.html |title=The Iowa Phoenix |accessmonthday=08-14 |accessyear=2006 |year=2000 |month=October |format= |work=Meat Processing |language=English }}</ref>  Most recently, West Liberty Foods posted US$442 million in revenue for 2006,<ref name="O'Keefe2" /> making the company the 56<sup>th</sup> largest meat packing company by sales in the United States.<ref name="Gazdziak">{{cite news |author = Gazdziak, Sam |title = The National Provisioner's Top 125. |work = National Provisioner, The |page = 56 |date = May 2006}}</ref>  Much of the company's sales come from large nationwide [[foodservice]] customers,<ref name="Young3" /> and, as of 2006, was [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s largest supplier of sliced sandwich meat, providing the [[franchising|franchise]] with more than 1 million pounds per week.<ref name="O'Keefe" /> As a result of servicing national customers, the company is inspected more than other food manufacturers.<ref name="Grocer">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlfoods.com/news/iowa-gr.htm |title= West Liberty Foods Finds Success with Cooperation |accessmonthday=08-14 |accessyear=2006 |year=2006 |work=Iowa Grocer |language=English }}</ref> West Liberty Foods' three plants have been [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001]] certified for meeting environmental management standards, and the West Liberty plant was the first turkey processing plant in the United States to receive this [[Professional certification|certification]].<ref name="Enviro">{{cite web|url= http://www.wlfoods.com/about/environment.htm |title=Environment |accessmonthday= 08-14|accessyear=2006 |language=English}}</ref>

West Liberty Foods maintains separate facilities for [[research and development]] and [[laboratory]] [[Experiment|testing]] services.  They are housed in adjacent buildings several blocks from the plant in West Liberty.<ref name="Young1" />  The R&D facility includes testing space for both [[raw food|raw]] and cooked product, and can create test products from start to finish, including initial formulation, final slicing, and [[Packaging and labelling|packaging]].<ref name="Young1" />  The lab conducts product quality testing for the three production facilities and uses [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technology for rapid bacteriological testing.<ref name="Bagel">{{cite news |author = Bagel, Ann |title = Food Safety First |work = Poultry |page = 16 |date = Apr/May 2005 }}</ref>  This system can return results within 30 hours of production.<ref name="Bagel" />

==History==
Prior to 1996, [[Oscar Mayer|Louis Rich]], the brand name for [[Oscar Mayer]]'s turkey [[Division (organisation)|division]], owned the processing plant in West Liberty, IA.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  In early 1996, Oscar Mayer's parent company, [[Kraft Foods]], announced that they would close the plant that December if no buyer purchased it.<ref name="Grocer" />  The Iowa turkey growers who sold to Kraft discussed purchasing the plant to ensure that [[Supply and demand|demand]] for their birds remained.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  In May, 1996, forty-seven of the turkey growers formed the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative(ITGC).<ref name="O'Keefe" />  ITGC purchased the plant from Kraft and took control of it in December.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  The growers hired meat industry veteran Ken Rutledge to be President and COO of the company.<ref name="Find">{{cite web|url= http://www.wlfoods.com/news/niche.html |title=Finding the Right Niche |accessmonthday=08-14 |accessyear=2006 |year=2006 |month=October |work=Meat Processing |language=English }}</ref> Oscar Mayer helped West Liberty Foods by promising to purchase half of the plant's output in 1997 and a quarter of the output in 1998 to help the [[startup company]].<ref name="AP">{{cite news | author =Associated Press | title =Low Prices Hurt Turkey Co-Op | work =Telegraph Herald | page =A5 | date =1997-12-15 | accessdate =2006-07-31 | language =English }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb</ref>

Production under ITGC ownership began in January 1997.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  The company faced financial difficulty because the turkey market was oversupplied and prices hit historic lows.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  While financial projections assumed a price of US$1.92 per pound for turkey, prices averaged US$1.46 per pound in 1997.<ref name="AP" /> During this time period, four of the growers left ITGC.<ref name="Grocer" />  Turkey prices eventually rebounded, and the company was bolstered by sales to [[Sara Lee]] near the end of 1998.<ref name="O'Keefe" />

Since the rebound, West Liberty Foods’ sales have grown steadily.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  In 2000, the company acquired a second plant in Sigourney, IA from [[Pinnacle Foods]] to meet rising [[Order (business)|orders]].<ref name="O'Keefe" />  The company grew again in April, 2003 when it opened a processing plant in Mount Pleasant, IA which was later expanded in 2004.<ref name="Young2">{{cite news |author = Young, Barbara |title = Branding Food Safety. |work = National Provisioner, The |date = May 2004}}</ref>  Company leadership changed in 2004 as Ed Garrett was named president and COO when Rutledge resigned to take a position with another growers' organization.<ref name="Change">{{cite news |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=11094778&BRD=1105&PAG=461&dept_id=151632&rfi=8 |title = Change at the Top of WL Foods |work = West Liberty Index |date = March 09, 2004 | accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}</ref> In 2006 the company entered into a marketing alliance agreement with [[Midvale, Utah]] based [[Norbest Foods]].<ref name="Release">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlfoods.com/about/news.htm |title=News and Press Releases http |accessmonthday=08-14 |accessyear=2006 |language=English }}</ref>

==Labor episode==
In 2004, [[Labour (economics)|workers]] at the West Liberty plant considered joining the [[United Food and Commercial Workers|United Food and Commercial Workers International Union]](UFCW).<ref name="Limbo">{{cite news |author = Ervin, Stacy |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12235105&BRD=1105&PAG=461&dept_id=151632&rfi=8 |title = West Liberty Foods Vote in Limbo |work = West Liberty Index |date = July 6, 2004 |accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}</ref>  On [[July 1]], [[2004]] the workers voted on whether they would be represented by UFCW Local 431.<ref name="Limbo" />  An initial tally of votes came out 301 in favor and 299 against [[trade union|union]] representation.<ref name="Limbo" />  However, the count did not include 13 ballots which were disputed by UFCW.<ref name="Limbo" />  The ballots were challenged on claims that they were cast by [[management]] personnel who would not be union members.<ref name="Limbo" />

A [[National Labor Relations Board]](NLRB) hearing to confirm or invalidate the vote was scheduled for [[January 5]], [[2005]] but then postponed until [[February 16]], [[2005]].<ref name="Post">{{cite news |author = Konrad, Sara |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13726507&BRD=1105&PAG=461&dept_id=151632&rfi=8 |title = West Liberty Foods Hearing Postponed |work = West Liberty Index  |date = January 11, 2005 |accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}</ref>  On [[February 1]], [[2005]] the company and UFCW settled their dispute.<ref name="Settle">{{cite news |author = Konrad, Sara |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=14011552&BRD=1105&PAG=461&dept_id=151632&rfi=8 |title = WL Foods, Labor Union Reach Settlement |work = West Liberty Index |date = February 22, 2005 |accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}</ref>  UFCW withdrew its objections, and West Liberty Foods posted a [[notice]] that they would not close the plant or fire workers if employees unionized.<ref name="Settle" />  This resulted in a final vote count of 303 to 308 against union representation.<ref name="Settle" />

UFCW Local 431 held a second vote at the West Liberty plant on [[July 15]], [[2005]].<ref name="Vote">{{cite news |author = Becker, Sarah |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=14883933&BRD=1105&PAG=461&dept_id=151632&rfi=8 |title = Workers Vote Down Union |work = West Liberty Index |date = July 19, 2005 |accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}</ref>  The vote was 231 to 322 against unionization.<ref name="Vote" />

==Plants==
[[Image:WLF Plants.jpg|frame|right|Locations of the three West Liberty Foods plants in Iowa]] 

West Liberty Foods' three plants combined can convert 4.5 million turkeys into product annually.<ref name="Young3" />  This equals approximately 180 million pounds of product per year.<ref name="Young3" />  Combined, the West Liberty and Sigourney plants can cook 2.8 million pounds per week.<ref name="O'Keefe" />

===West Liberty plant===
The West Liberty Plant is a 270,000&nbsp;[[square foot]] facility which slaughters and further processes turkey products.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  The slaughter operation converts approximately 20,000 turkeys per [[Working time|workday]].<ref name="Perkins">{{cite news | first =Jerry | last =Perkins | title =West Liberty Foods packs in success | work =Des Moines Register, The | page =1M | date =2005-05-22 | accessdate =2006-07-31 | language =English }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb</ref>

Louis H. Rich, purchased the West Liberty plant, a former tomato canning facility, in 1943, when he decided to expand the operations of the Rock Island Produce Company, located on 9th Street in [[Rock Island, Illinois]].<ref name="O'Keefe" />  The plant was converted to a poultry, including chickens and turkeys, slaughter facility in 1946 and refocused by Rich's sons, Norman and Martin, on turkey in 1949.<ref name="Phoenix" />  The plant was first expanded in 1960.  Oscar Mayer acquired the plant, through its purchase of Louis Rich, Inc., in 1979 and used it for turkey production until selling the plant in 1996.<ref name="Phoenix" />

===Mount Pleasant plant===
The Mount Pleasant plant is a 85,000&nbsp;square foot facility that is used for slicing cooked [[cheese]], turkey, chicken, beef, pork and other products.<ref name="Bagel" />  The plant employs approximately 500 people<ref name="O'Keefe2" /> working in three shifts.<ref name="Young2" />  A 68,000&nbsp;square foot [[Millard Cold Storage|Millard]] cold [[Warehouse|storage]] facility is located adjacent to the Mount Pleasant plant.<ref name="Bagel" />  The two facilities are connected, and product is immediately transferred by [[Conveyor belt|conveyor]] from the plant to cold storage when packaging is complete.<ref name="Bagel" />

The design and operation of the Mount Pleasant plant to are intended decrease potential hazards to food safety.<ref name="Lazar">{{cite news |author = Lazar, Virginia |title = Listeria Benchmark: 0 |work = Meat Processing |page = 26 |date = November 2003}}</ref>  WLF representatives have stated that the goal of the Mount Pleasant plant is to create a [[pathogen]]-free environment.<ref name="Lazar" />  Because company officials believe that the food safety aspects of the plant are unique in the meat industry, they submitted the plant design for [[patent]] approval through the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]].<ref name="Young2" /> The Mount Pleasant plant is located approximately 50 miles from either the West Liberty or Sigourney plants.<ref name="Young2" />  This reduces the likelihood that pathogens will be carried either by air or foot traffic from a raw production area to Mount Pleasant's ready to eat production.<ref name="Young2" />

The Mount Pleasant facility consists of approximately 20 individual processing cells that are separated from one another and are set up so that they could operate as individual meat slicing facilities.<ref name="Bagel">{{cite news |author = Bagel, Ann |title = Food Safety First |work = Poultry |page = 16 |date = Apr/May 2005 }}</ref>  Before anti-microbial [[flooring]] was poured, the cells were erected with [[stainless steel]] [[Antimicrobial|anti-microbial]] walls that are built into the floor.<ref name="Lazar" /><ref name="Bagel" />  Each processing cell has independent refrigeration and [[drainage]] systems.  The refrigeration systems [[Air filter|filter]] the cell's air and maintain positive [[Pressure|air pressure]] at 38 °F, and the drainage systems are sealed off and flooded with sanitizers nightly.<ref name="Bagel" />

During operation, fully cooked meat or cheese logs arrive sealed in impermeable [[Casing (sausage)|casings]].<ref name="Bagel" />  The logs go through a casing sanitation step that involves being treated with a sanitizing liquid before the casings are removed from the logs.<ref name="Bagel" />  The logs then undergo a post-lethality treatment by passing through an [[infrared]] [[pasteurization]] tunnel to kill pathogens on the logs.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  The logs are then mechanically transferred to slicers, sliced, and placed in sealed packages that are transferred out of the processing cell.<ref name="Bagel" />  The mechanical transfers decrease the risk of product contamination by reducing handling of product by personnel .<ref name="Bagel" />

Food safety is a factor in hiring employees at the Mount Pleasant facility.  Before applying, potential employees must complete a 16 hour food safety training course through [[Iowa State University]].<ref name="Lazar" />  The class includes written tests which each applicant must pass before completing the course.<ref name="Lazar" />  On the job, employees must don a sealed [[clean room suit]] before entering slicing cells.<ref name="Lazar" />  The suits are cleaned and sealed in a [[clean room]] [[laundry]] facility in [[North Carolina]] by the uniform company [[Cintas]].<ref name="Lazar" />  Employees replace the clean suit each time they leave the cell so each employee averages five suits per day.<ref name="Lazar" />

===Sigourney plant===
The Sigourney plant is a 49,000&nbsp;square foot facility and employs approximately 170 employees.<ref name="O'Keefe" />  The Sigourney facility is used for cooking and processing meat products and does not slaughter or slice products, which is done at the West Liberty and Mount Pleasant plants.<ref name="O'Keefe" />

===Tremonton, Utah plant===
As of 2006, West Liberty Foods plans to build a plant in [[Tremonton, Utah]].<ref name="Wallace">{{cite news | first =Brice | last =Wallace | coauthors =Anderton, Dave | title =Meat processor opts for move to Box Elder | work =Deseret News, The | page =D12 | date =2006-07-29 | accessdate =2006-07-31 | language =English }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb</ref>  The plant will not slaughter,<ref name="Wallace" /> but the 200,000&nbsp;square foot facility<ref name="CoPack1">{{cite news | title =A New Facility Arises in Utah: West Liberty Foods is building the world's most advanced meat-processing facility, not in Iowa, but out West. | work =Co-Packing Solutions | publisher =Stagnito Communications | pages =4-5 | date =June 2007 | language =English }}</ref> will allot 93,000&nbsp;square foot for processing and 74,000&nbsp;square foot for slicing a variety of meat products.<ref name="Wallace" />  The company broke ground for the facility in October, 2006.<ref name="O'Keefe2" /> It is expected to begin production in July 2007.<ref name="Wallace" />  When completed, the plant will be the first in North America to slice 10 ft. slicing logs.<ref name="Ford">{{cite news | first =George | last =Ford | title =W.

Initially, the company investigated sites for the new plant in [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]].<ref name="Mitchell1">{{cite news | first =Lesley | last =Mitchell | title =Meat-processing plant to employ 500 in Utah | work =Salt Lake Tribune, The | date =2006-04-21 | accessdate = 2006-07-31 | language =English }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb</ref>  It requested US$5.2 million in tax incentives Utah to build in [[Pleasant View, Utah]].<ref name="Mitchell1" />  On [[April 26]], [[2006]] Utah's Department of Community and Economic Development approved a US$2 million tax-rebate over 10 years.<ref name="Trentelman2">{{cite news | first =Charles | last =Trentelman | title =Incentives OK'd to lure meat plant | work =Standard-Examiner | date =2006-04-27 | accessdate =2006-07-31 | language =English }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb</ref>  The incentives were conditioned on the new jobs paying a certain level above the county median wage, offering health insurance, and the company staying in Utah for 10 years.<ref name="Wallace" />  Pleasant View offered another US$1.4-US$1.8 million dollars in incentives.<ref name="Trentelman2" />  However, construction in Pleasant View became impossible when it was discovered that much of the site consisted of wetland areas.<ref name="Trentelman3">{{cite news | first =Charles | last =Trentelman | title =Wetlands scuttle plans for meat plant | work =Standard-Examiner | date =2006-04-10 | accessdate =2006-07-31 | language =English }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb</ref>  After this development, the state held the incentive offer open provided that West Liberty Foods could find another suitable site that met Utah's requirements.<ref name="Mitchell2">{{cite news | first =Mitchell | last =Lesley | title =Incentives that were offered to West Liberty may still be an option, recruiting office says | work =Salt Lake Tribune, The | date =2006-05-09 | accessdate =2006-07-31 | language =English }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb</ref>

On [[July 29]], [[2006]], the company announced that they would build the new plant in Tremonton, Utah.<ref name="Wallace" />  The tax incentives will total an 80% property tax break, but Tremonton is projected to experience a US$508 thousand financial benefit over 12 years after the plant is completed.<ref name="Blake2" />  Of the 500 jobs at the plant, 300 are expected to pay between US$21,500 and US$26,875.<ref name="Trentelman2" /> The rest of the jobs will pay more with about 100 paying around US$37,000.<ref name="Trentelman2" />
