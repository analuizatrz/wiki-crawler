'''Florida Atlantic University''', also commonly referred to as '''FAU''' or '''Florida Atlantic''', is a [[coeducational]] [[state university]] located in [[Boca Raton]], [[Florida]]. The university has six additional partner campuses in [[Florida]]; located in the cities of [[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]], [[Davie, Florida|Davie]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]], [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]], and [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]], at the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]]. FAU's seven campuses span 150 [[mile]]s of Florida's eastern coastline, and serve a seven-[[county]] region which has a populace of more than five million people.<ref name="FAU Press Description">{{cite press release | title=Early Detection of Developmental Disorders in Babies to be a Focus of New Infant Development Laboratory | publisher=Florida Atlantic University: Office of Communications | date=[[2005-09-22]] | url=http://wise.fau.edu/communications/pressarchive/2005-09/16.php | accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref>

The university opened its doors in [[1964]], becoming the fifth public university in Florida, and the first university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate level courses. Florida Atlantic was established by the [[Florida Legislature]] in order to serve the educational needs of the southeastern section of the state. While initial enrollment was 867 students, this number would increase dramatically in 1984 when the university admitted its first undergraduate students.<ref name="History 1955-1969">{{cite web | url = http://www.fau.edu/explore/timeline.php | title = Explore FAU History: Milestones in FAU History (1955-1969) | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | accessdate = 2006-08-22}}</ref> By [[2007]], enrollment has grown to more than 26,000 students representing 144 countries, 48 [[US state|states]] and the [[District of Columbia]].<ref name="Facts">{{cite web | url = http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm | title = 2006-2007 Quick Facts | publisher = Florida Atlantic University: Office of Institutional Effectiveness & Analysis | accessdate = 2006-12-26}}</ref> Since its inception, FAU has awarded degrees to more than 100,000 alumni worldwide.

==History==
{{main article|History of Florida Atlantic University}}
===Beginnings===

On [[July 15]], [[1961]], the [[Florida Legislature]] passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in southeastern Florida.  A [[1940s]]-era [[Boca Raton Airport|Army airbase]] in Boca Raton, Florida was selected as the site of the new university.  In [[1962]], the [[Florida Board of Control]] selected "Florida Atlantic University" as the name of the new institution.  Ground was broken on [[December 8]], [[1962]].  FAU opened on [[September 14]], [[1964]], six days behind schedule because of [[Hurricane Cleo]].  The first university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate work, FAU had an initial student body of 867.  U.S. [[Presidential system|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] dedicated the university on October 25, 1964, and received the first honorary doctorate awarded by Florida Atlantic.  
[[Image:FAU Alumni Plaza.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Alumni Plaza]]
 
In [[1969]], the [[Florida Board of Regents|Board of Regents]] (successor to the Board of Control) approved an intercollegiate athletics program at FAU.  The university teams become known as the [[Burrowing owl|Owls]].  FAU expanded to [[Broward County, Florida]] in 1971, with the founding of the Commercial Boulevard campus in [[Fort Lauderdale]].  During that same year the university was also named a burrowing owl sanctuary.  By 1973, fall semester enrollment was 5,632.  By the fall semester of [[1983]], enrollment would reach 9,388.  For the first time in [[1984]], due to a rapidly growing population, Florida Atlantic opened its doors to [[freshmen]] and [[sophomores]].  In 1985, the Downtown Fort Lauderdale campus opened on Las Olas Boulevard.  

In [[1989]], the [[Florida Legislature]] designated Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County.  The university also reached $10 million in sponsored research activity for the first time.  Fall semester enrollment was 13,148.  In [[1993]], FAU was elected to the [[National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges]], the nation’s oldest higher education professional association.  The university's intercollegiate teams also joined the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] and moved to [[NCAA Division I]].  In [[1995]], Florida Atlantic purchased [[Barry University|Barry University’s]] [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] facility to establish a campus on the [[Treasure Coast]], in partnership with [[Indian River Community College]].  By 1997, sponsored research funding exceeded $24 million.  

In 1999, [[Howard Schnellenberger]], a legendary figure in [[college football]], was named Florida Atlantic’s first head [[american football|football]] coach.  The Barry and Florence Friedberg Lifelong Learning Center opened on the Boca Raton campus.  The [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] campus also opened and was formally named for the late [[John D. MacArthur]].  Sponsored research funding exceeded $36 million.  By [[2003]], fall semester enrollment was 24,961.  FAU also has maintained the most diverse student body in the State University System, with [[minority]] enrollment of 34.6 percent.

In 2003, the State of Florida awarded FAU $10 million to establish the Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology, a research facility that searches the waters off Florida's coastline for drugs from natural sources that could be used to treat [[cancer]], [[heart disease]] and other serious illnesses.  The Lady Owls [[softball]] team won the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] championship for the seventh time and was listed among the all-time greatest teams in college softball history by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association.  In 2004, FAU admitted its first students to the [[University of Miami]]/Florida Atlantic University [[medical school]] partnership.

In 2006, FAU enrollment dropped 1.3% which could result in losses of up $2 million in expected student tuition and fees. This pattern mirrors other school districts in the area such as [[Broward County Public Schools]] which lost 10,000 students over the past two years and Palm Beach County schools which lost just over 3,000. Officials believe the high housing prices and previous years hurricanes are a factor.

===University presidents===
*Dr. Kenneth Rast Williams 1962-1973
*Dr. Glenwood Creech 1973-1983
*Dr. Helen Popovich 1983-1989
*Dr. [[Anthony J. Catanese]] 1990-2002
*[[Frank Brogan|Frank T. Brogan]] 2003-current

Frank T. Brogran became FAU's president in 2003.  He graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati]] and holds a master's degree from Florida Atlantic University.  Brogan served as [[Lieutenant Governor]] of the [[State of Florida]], under [[Jeb Bush|Governor Jeb Bush]] from 1998-2003.

==Regional Campuses==
In addition to the original campus in Boca Raton, FAU also has six other campuses to service the [[South Florida]] region. These campuses are located in the cities of:
*[[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]]
*[[Davie, Florida|Davie]]
*[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]
*[[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]]
*[[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] 
*[[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], at the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] 
The Boca Raton campus remains the largest campus with 69% of FAU's students enrolled there.[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm] The Boca Raton campus and the Jupiter campus are residential campuses, whereas the other campuses are strictly commuter due to the fact that they have no student housing. At the present time, four student residence halls are present on the main Boca campus: Indian River Towers, Heritage Park Towers, Algonquin Hall, and the Village Apartments. A fifth facility, patterned after Heritage Park Towers, will be home to 600 more students in Fall 2007. There is additional housing located at the Jupiter campus for the [[Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College]]. 

==Academics==
[[Image:FAU Library.jpg|left|thumb|250px|S.E. Wimberly Library]]
In Fall 2006, FAU admitted only 59% of overall applicants and 54% of FTIC (first time in college) applicants. Graduate admissions was 54%.[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm] 

Average lecture class size for undergraduates is 32 people, with 11 people as the average lecture class size for graduate students. Student to Faculty ratio is 19:1 (25657:1020). The top three undergraduate majors by enrollment are Elementary Education, Management, and Accounting, respectively. The top three graduate majors by enrollment are Business Administration, Nursing, and Educational Leadership. The average age for first time in college students is 18, however, the average age for all undergraduates is 25. The average age for graduates is 34.[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm]

In 1998, more than one-quarter of Florida Atlantic freshmen were "alternative admissions" admitted to ensure diversity in the student body and thus did not meet the state of Florida's minimum admission standards.[http://www.sptimes.com/State/120698/Some_find_university_2.html] In 2004, FAU's Board of Trustees raised admission standards for incoming Freshmen. [http://www.upressonline.com/media/storage/paper518/news/2004/02/05/Opinions/New-Admissions.Standards.Good.For.Fau.Bad.For.Florida-597434.shtml?norewrite200607121033&sourcedomain=www.upressonline.com] The Board stated a goal for a 3.2 [[GPA]] and a 500 score on each section of the [[SAT]] for admittance in 2007. Students with lower grades and scores would be required to take remedial courses at a [[community college]] before entering FAU. As a result of the increased admissions standards, by 2006, the average freshman entering Florida Atlantic had a 3.3 high school GPA, and scored 1052 on the SAT and a 22 on the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]].[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm]

FAU has two Honors programs. The Boca Raton campus has an Honors Program called the University Scholars Program, which offers special Honors Seminars, Honors Forums, Honors sections of Freshman courses and the option of advanced course substitutions in the freshman year. Thirty-six students are admitted each year, each with a minimum of 3.5 GPA and 1250 SAT/28 ACT. To date, 400 students have graduated from the program.[http://honorsboca.fau.edu/index2.htm] The Jupiter campus hosts the [[Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College]].

Florida Atlantic University operates the largest continuing education program in the [[United States]]. Named the Lifelong Learning Society, the program serves the educational interests of more than 20,000 [[senior citizens]] by providing classes focusing on subjects of interest, and provides audit options for regular university classes. In order to facilitate the growth of this program, in 1999 the Barry and Florence Friedberg Lifelong Learning Center opened on the Boca Raton campus.

==Research==
Sponsored research at FAU reaches more than $60 million per year.<ref name="Research">{{cite web | url = http://www.fau.edu/research/ovp/index.php | title = Message from the Vice President | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | accessdate = 2007-01-31}}</ref> 

Florida Atlantic has two [[Research and Development|Research and Development Parks (R&D)]]. One is located in [[Deerfield Beach]], Florida, and the other is located on the main Boca Raton campus. The R&D Parks provide outside research companies the ability to interact with the university community and take advantage of its facilities, resources, and expertise.  Located inside the R&D Park on the Boca Raton campus is a Technology Business Incubator (TBI). The TBI works to foster the start-up and growth of technology based businesses associated with Florida Atlantic University.[http://www.research-park.org/]

[[The Scripps Research Institute]] is currently in the process of developing a sister campus at the Jupiter FAU campus. '''Scripps Florida''' now operates with approximately 188 scientists, technicians, and administrative staff at a 40,000 square-foot lab facility.[http://www1.tcpalm.com/tcp/business/article/0,2541,TCP_998_4867069,00.html] Upon completion Scripps will operate out of a 364,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art biomedical research facility focusing on basic biomedical science, drug discovery, and technology development.

FAU is the home of '''The Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology'''. Established in 2003, the University's Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology was selected by Florida’s Emerging Technology Commission as one of three centers in the state to receive $10 million in initial funding. FAU beat out some of Florida's top research universities including University of Florida and Florida State University for the initial money from the state.[http://www1.tcpalm.com/tcp/local_news/article/0,2545,TCP_16736_5458129,00.html] Since receiving the startup funding, FAU has secured an additional $26 million from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, the center has emerged as an academic and industry partnership combining expertise in [[ocean engineering]], [[biotechnology|marine biotechnology]], [[functional genomics]], [[proteomics]], and [[bioinformatics]]. Researchers, scientists, and students at the center are designing technologies to explore the sea, working to discover new medicines, and developing new therapeutics to combat agents of [[bioterrorism]].[http://wise.fau.edu/research/centers.php#EXCEL] 

Florida Atlantic is also the home of '''The Imaging Technology Center and [[NASA]] Imaging Technology Space Center'''. Located in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Center specializes in digital imaging research and development for use in both government and commercial applications in the areas of [[medical technology]], [[surveillance]], [[communications]], [[education]], [[inspection]], [[observation|scientific observation]], [[manufacturing]], visual recognition and identification, and [[motion picture]] and [[digital video]]. Within the Imaging Technology Center is one of 12 NASA Research Partnership Centers throughout the nation which develops dual-use research and development with the participation of NASA and other related industries in the U.S. The center occupies two sets of laboratories and administrative offices on Florida Atlantic’s main campus in Boca Raton and at the Fort Lauderdale Tower campus. 

The Imaging Technology Center is developing a [[curriculum]] for [[digital imaging]] and processing, thereby establishing FAU as the only university in the nation to offer this technical concentration — a highly valuable resource for [[national defense]] and the medical and video industries. [http://wise.fau.edu/research/centers.php#IMAGING]

In 2007, FAU entered into an exclusive license agreement with '''Lockheed Martin''' to develop and produce a rapidly-deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses. [http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=32938]

==Medical Education==
[[Image:FAU Schmidt BioMedical Center.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Schmidt Biomedical Science Center]]
In 2004, FAU launched an allopathic (M.D.) medical education program in conjunction with the [[University of Miami]] (UM). The program is a regional campus of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and as such, is known as the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine at FAU (UMMSM@FAU). The curriculums are identical at both campuses. [http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/0,1770,2600-1;31843-3,00.html] [http://med.fau.edu/biomedical/ummsm_rmc/prospective_students.html#FrequentlyAskedQuestions]Enrollment is currently limited to 32 students, with an expansion to 64 students expected in the near future. [http://med.fau.edu/biomedical/ummsm_rmc/prospective_students.html#FrequentlyAskedQuestions] 

Previously, medical students spent the first two years of their education at the Boca Raton campus before transferring to [[Miami]] for rotations and receiving their degree from UM. Starting in Fall 2007, medical students will be able to complete all four years of the medical curriculum in Boca Raton. [http://med.fau.edu/biomedical/ummsm_rmc/ummsm_rmc.html]

On June 28, 2006, Florida Atlantic and [[Boca Raton Community Hospital]] approved an agreement between the two institutions to implement a land lease for the development and operation of a community-university affiliated teaching hospital. 

The hospital, to be called the Charles E. Schmidt Medical Center[http://www.bocaratonnews.com/index.php?src=news&refno=19171&category=Local%20News],  will serve as the primary teaching hospital for the regional campus of the [[Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine|UM Miller School of Medicine]] at FAU.  Facility construction is expected to begin in [[2008]] with completion by [[2011]]. Approximately 38 acres of Florida Atlantic land, located on the southeast corner of FAU’s Boca Raton campus, will host the [[infrastructure]] for the teaching hospital. This will enable medical students to complete their entire education at Florida Atlantic's Boca Raton campus. The private room, 530-bed hospital will provide FAU facilities and resources to support [[undergraduate]] and [[Graduate school|graduate]] medical education programs customary to primary teaching hospitals within major academic medical centers.  The facilities will include resident/student conference rooms, a [[conference]] center with teleconferencing capabilities including an [[auditorium]] and small group conference rooms, resident sleeping quarters with lockers, resident dining facilities, a resident lounge, a medical [[library]] with state-of-the-art [[Information technology|IT]] systems and increased square footage in other areas of the hospital to accommodate students and residents. [http://www.fau.edu/communications/mediarelations/Releases0606/060620.php]

==FAU Record Label==
As part of its Commercial Music program, FAU has a full-service record label. The label, named Hoot/Wisdom Recordings in recognition of the university mascot, began in fall of 2002 under the direction of Michael Zager, professor of music and Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Performing Arts. All Commercial Music majors work on the label. Students have the opportunity to work in all creative (recording, producing, graphic design, videos, promotion, etc) and business (A&R, accounting, publishing, artist management, sales, etc) aspects of the music industry. The state-of-the-art studio is the first student-run label of any university in the United States.

*During Finals Week of Spring and Fall semesters, the FAU Student Government Program Board holds a free Late Night Breakfast in the Centre Marketplace.  Besides free food, students also enjoy a DJ, free candy, giveaways, and occasionally small carnival rides.

*FAU students wear red to show their support for FAU athletics, made popular by the "Bury the Burrow in Red" marketing campaign of 2007 for the televised FAU-FIU matchup game.

===Greek Life===
FAU is home to a number of national fraternities and sororities, however, there are currently no on-campus "frat houses" (the 2006 Boca Raton Campus Master Plan includes plans for 8 Greek Houses to be built within 3 years [http://www.fau.edu/facilities/uavp/masterplans-folder/bocaraton-mp-folder/Boca-MP-GOPs-Figures-Draft-100506/FIG_-_Executive_Summary.pdf][http://www.fau.edu/facilities/uavp/masterplans-folder/bocaraton-mp-folder/Boca-MP-GOPs-Figures-Draft-100506/FIG_-_Element_7_-_Housing.pdf]). The inter-fraternity council at FAU is comprised of [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Chi Theta]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Sigma Alpha Mu]], and [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]. The [[National Panhellenic Conference]] member sororities on campus are [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Delta Phi Epsilon]], [[Phi Sigma Sigma]], and [[Theta Phi Alpha]].

===Notable Student Activism===
*Five members of the FAU community took part in a 200-mile humanitarian effort called the Bike2Belarus Initiative, a directive of the Irish Students 10k. One of the poorest nations in Europe, Belarus was ravaged by after effects of the 1986 Chernobyl accident. Ultimately, the bike trip raised a quarter of a million dollars for Belarus, matched by the Irish Government and used for the construction of a hospice and orphanage.[http://wise.fau.edu/advancement/legacy/FAU_legacy_Magazine_--_Fall_2006.pdf]
*The Annual FAU 16-hour Dance Marathon raises money for the Children's Miracle network, which in turn benefits the Shands Children's Hospital at the University of Florida. In 2004, thirty-eight dancers ultimately raised $7,000.[http://www.fau.edu/communications/pressarchive/2004-04/5.php] In 2005, more than fifty volunteers danced the night away to raise $11,500.[http://www.forbetterlife.org/news/news_story.asp?newsID=1099]
* FAU Softball raised $1,400 over a three-day tournament in its effort to "Strike Out Cancer." The fundraiser, noted by the ''Sun-Sentinel'', was held during the FAU Classic softball tournament on Feb.16-18, 2007. Members collected donations for each strikeout. All of the proceeds went to the America Cancer Society for the 2007 Relay for Life that took place at FAU's Boca Raton campus.

====Living Learning Communities (LLC)====
The LLC program at FAU allows students with similar interests (i.e. majors) and needs to live together and take classes together as a "residential community." The program was established to ease the transition from high school and allow students to make friends from day one at FAU. These residents also receive special programming and support tailored to their specific needs. LLC participants are committed for one year to the program and must live in Heritage Park Towers to participate.
* Currently, there are six LLC programs available: Engineering and Computer Science, Explore (for undecided freshmen), Global Connections (Language/Cultural Studies), Women's Leadership, Healthy Owls (Wellness), and Music. [http://www.fau.edu/retention/2007-08LLCBrochure.pdf][http://www.fau.edu/housing/housingbroch07.pdf]

This New Food Court, slated to open for the Fall 2007 semester, will introduce many new vendors including Mamma Leone's and Wendy's.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Recognition==
*'''Sanctuary.''' The Boca Raton campus was designated a [[burrowing owl]] sanctuary in [[1971]], by the [[Audubon Society]]. The owl prefers the campus because there are not many predators other than cats, near the [[Boca Raton Airport]]. The feisty bird, traditionally associated with wisdom and determination, serves as the University's mascot.  Unfortunately, however, the once-abundant burrowing owls have declined dramatically in recent years.  This is due not only to necessary campus development (buildings and parking lots), but also to "beautifying" landscaping and irrigation projects which established non-native sod in previously unsodded sandy and grassy areas on campus.

*'''Media rankings.''' [[Washington Monthly]], which publishes an annual ranking of top universities, placed FAU at number 240 in the nation. [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0609.national.html] In the [[2006]] edition of the [[U.S. News & World Report]] rankings of "Best Colleges", FAU was ranked in the fourth tier of national universities.

Among traditionally white institutions, the University was ranked 16th overall in conferring bachelor’s degrees to African-American students.[http://wise.fau.edu/communications/mediarelations/Releases0706/070603.php]

*'''Overall Athletics.''' FAU's Athletic Department was recently ranked 79th in the nation by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics|National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) ]].  In conjunction with ''[[USA Today]]'' and the United States Sports Academy, NACDA recognized the University for its [[Division I]] athletic programs and accomplishments.  This national ranking places Florida Atlantic in the top 24% of 326 [[NCAA]] Division I universities.  FAU was the only school in either the [[Sun Belt Conference|Sun Belt]] or [[Atlantic Sun Conference|Atlantic Sun]] conferences that placed in the top 100 and was the 4th highest ranked program in the state of Florida, finishing behind the [[University of Florida]], [[Florida State University]] and the [[University of Miami]].

*'''Medical School.''' The University of Miami Miller School of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University (USSM at FAU) is one of 10 United States' medical schools, including [[Vanderbilt]] and [[UCLA]], to receive an [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] grant, supported by the Josiah Macy Foundation, to enhance medical students’ and medical residents’ ability to care for patients with chronic diseases.[http://www.fau.edu/communications/mediarelations/Releases0606/060614.php]
