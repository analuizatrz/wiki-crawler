==Gameplay==
:''For further information see [[Empire Earth#Gameplay|Empire Earth Gameplay]].''
The gameplay in ''Art of Conquest'' is the same as in the original ''Empire Earth'', albeit with some changes. Variable difficulty was added to those scenarios  which had not received it in a patch of the original ''Empire Earth''. Online multiplayer capabilities were added, allowing players to play online with up to 7 other players either over the internet via a lobby system, or over a [[LAN]].

The new Space Age (Epoch XV) allows the building of spaceports and [[spaceships]] on maps that allow it.<ref name="GameSpot"/> [[Robot]]s replace Citizens in the Nano Age and [[infantry]] in the Space Age (these robots are known as ''Watchmen''). Nano age Farms are run by robots, and by the Space Age farms no longer need citizens to manage them<!-- since they are now self-sufficient. commented: does 'them' refer to the citizens or the farms? -->.

In ''The Art of Conquest'', each civilization has its own power, or "''civ power''". Often, these powers are only available during certain epochs. A ''civ power'' gives each nation a specialty: the Chinese, for example, have the ability of "Just in Time  manufacturing or the Japanese with the powerful "cyber ninja".<ref name="IGN"/>

''Empire Earth'' supports [[multiplayer games]] over LAN connections and online. Multiplayer games are identical in form to single player games. ''Art of Conquest'' multiplayer play has many [[Cheating in online games#Exploits|exploits]], which players can use to give themselves an unfair advantage. The game's publisher, [[Vivendi Games]], has set up forums where players can report exploits.<ref> [http://forums.vugames.com/category.jspa?categoryID=30 Forum Used for catching Glitches] Retrieved February 21, 2007. </ref>

==Campaigns==
Three new campaigns were added in The ''Art of Conquest'': a [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] campaign about [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Julius Caesar]], a campaign involving the warfare in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during [[World War II]], and a futuristic [[Asia]]n campaign involving the colonization of Mars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/empire-earth-the-art-of-conquest/ |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest (PC)| |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=Gamespy }}</ref>
===Roman Campaign===
The Roman campaign revolves around the struggles of Marius and the conquests of [[Julius Caesar]]. The campaign comprises six distinct scenarios. The story begins in the early Roman Republic. The player fights a war against various local tribes of Italy and barbarian invaders. During this time, the player can conscript citizens. Then the story moves into Marius's war with [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. In this scenario, the player secures victory by liberating Rome. The remaining four scenarios are about Julius Caesar's years as a general. It covers Caesar's war in the east against Sulla, the conquest of [[Gaul]] and the invasion of [[Iron Age Britain|Britain]], and Caesar's war with his former ally and friend [[Pompey]]. This scenario starts with the famous crossing of the [[Rubicon]] and ends at the battle of [[Farsala]]. The final story details the conquest of [[Egypt]].

===Pacific Campaign===
The Pacific campaign comprises four distinct scenarios. The opening scenario lets the player control the [[Battle of Midway]]. This scenario concludes with the sinking of Japanese aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']]. Then the story covers the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] in 1943, and later the island-hopping campaign directed by [[Douglas MacArthur]] which involves killing Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]. The next scenarios include a special mission in [[Burma]], the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and the reconquest of [[Leyte]]. The story concludes with the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]. This scenario is completed by sending five marines to the southern tip of the Island. This refers to the famous image of US Marines raising the [[flag of the United States]] at [[Iwo Jima|Mount Suribachi]]. ''See [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''

===Asian Campaign===
[[Image:Pc empire-earth zeitalter-ss1-1-.jpg|right|thumb|240px|A game taking place on an alien planet.]]
This campaign is told from the perspective of the Kwan Do family, an influential family who claim to be descendants of the [[Qin Dynasty]], and is split into two parts.
Part One details the colonization of [[Mars]]. As soon as it is discovered that it is possible to colonize Mars, the major superpowers of Earth scramble to develop the technologies and resources needed to establish settlements. One of these powers is the newly-formed United Federation of Asian Republics (UFAR), founded and ultimately controlled by the Kwan Do family. The Kwan Do family are the rich owners of ''Kwan Do Electronics and Communications''. The UFAR government struggles to suppress local rebellions and terrorist activities by the ''Eye of God'', an extremist [[Christianity|Christian]] organization who claim that Earth should be the only home to mankind. Meanwhile, the UFAR also struggles to develop a colonial programme competing against rival superpowers. A UFAR colony on Mars is eventually built, with help from Japan, alongside settlements built by the US/[[Canada|Canadian]] Conglomerate, the European Union of Nations, Novaya Russia, and the Republic of Japan. With these colonies established, Mars is divided into five regions.
Part Two is set 250 years after the first part, during the Space Age Epoch. The Kwan Do dynasty has been overthrown, and harsh conditions on Mars and an increasingly negative perception of the [[Earth]] governments have finally forced the Martian colonists into rebellion. During the revolutions, Khan Sun Do, a descendant of the Kwan Do family, unites the five territories. With the acquisition of [[Space Battleship Yamato]], the Martians fight an inter-planetary war against Earth to secure their independence. The campaign ends with the last battle for Martian independence and the installation of Khan Sun Do as the first leader of Mars.

==Development and release==
The ''Art of Conquest'' expansion pack for ''[[Empire Earth]]'' was announced in May of 2002 by Sierra (the game's original publisher, later taken over by [[Vivendi]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/empireearththeartofconquest/preview.html |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest Preview|accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=Strategy Informer }}</ref> The development of the game was turned over to [[Mad Doc Software]] from [[Stainless Steel Studios]] because Stainless Steel were already working on ''[[Empires: Dawn of the Modern World]]''.<ref name="dev">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/news.html?sid=2865776 |title=First look: Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author=Sam Parker |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=GameSpot }}</ref> According to Steve Beinner, the brand manager of the ''Empire Earth'' series, ''Empire Earth'''s expansion pack was planned even before the original game was released.<ref name="develop"/> The developers listened to feedback from the game community and planned the new features and release schedule accordingly.<ref name="develop"/> In an interview with IGN.com, Steve Beinner said "People were asking for additional scenarios and extra units. That's based upon surveys we did and distributors on a worldwide basis."<ref name="develop">{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/359/359707p1.html |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author=Steve Butts |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=IGN }}</ref>

Work on ''Art of Conquest'' began in early 2002, with a planned release date later that same year. The developers decided "the game won't be present at [[E3]], because of the tight development schedule and the fact that Sierra didn't want the developers to be distracted by creating an E3 demo."<ref name="dev"/> Beta testing for ''Art of Conquest'' began on August 5, 2002, and consisted of a single multiplayer map that could be played through all 15 of the expansion pack's ages, allowing players to try out all the new features of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/news.html?sid=2876571&mode=recent |title=Art of Conquest beta now available |author=Sam Parker |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=Gamespot}}</ref>

''Art of Conquest'' was included in the release of the ''Empire Earth Gold Edition'', which was a re-release of both ''Empire Earth'' and ''Art of Conquest''.<ref name="GameSpotGold">{{cite web |url=http://gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearthgoldedition/news.html?sid=6091979|title=Empire Earth: Gold Edition Company Line |accessdate=2007-03-17|publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref>

The overall reception of ''Art of Conquest'' was mediocre. [[Game Rankings]] averaged it at 66%,<ref name="GameRankings">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/561395.asp?q=Empire%20Earth |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest - PC|accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=GameRankings }}</ref> and [[Metacritic]] averaged it slightly lower, at 63%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/empireearthart?q=Empire%20Earth |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest Expansion |accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=MetaCritic }}</ref> IGN, who gave it a 7.8 out of 10, stated "While it's a solid game, there's just not enough here to compel me to reawaken the substantial addiction the first game generated. Whether or not it's worth it for you to pick this one up depends almost entirely on how much you enjoyed the original game. With so few significant changes it plays almost exactly the same. For those who couldn't get enough of Empire Earth, the expansion should be a perfect fit. Just don't expect the breadth and scope of the first game."<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/372/372262p2.html |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author=Steve Butts |accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=IGN }}</ref> Armchair Empire gave the game a 6.8 out of 10, and commented "AoC doesn’t exactly bring any shame or disgrace to Empire Earth (EE), but it doesn’t do anything to make itself a must have for EE fans. That being said, most EE fans will like what AoC has to offer."<ref name="Armchair">{{cite web |url=http://www.armchairempire.com/Reviews/PC%20Games/empire-earth-art-conquest.htm |title=Empire Earth: Art of Conquest |author=Omni |accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=Armchair Empire}}</ref> Finally, GameSpot gave it a 5.2 out of 10, and said "Ultimately, The Art of Conquest doesn't add enough to make much of a difference."<ref name="GameSpot">.{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/review.html?sid=2881249 |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author=Tom Chick|accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=GameSpot }}</ref>
A notable criticism from GameSpot was regarding the way Space was implemented in the game. Spaceships were only available on certain maps and the gameplay was very similar to water -- a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships.<ref name="GameSpot"/>
Other reviewers found fault with the game's price of 30 USD. The IGN reviewer said "I like ''Art of Conquest'' enough but it just falls short of being worth the $30 price tag."<ref name="IGN"/>

===Audio===
''Art of Conquest'''s music was never release as a soundtrack CD, but the music in the game received critical approval, receiving  7 out of 10 from GameSpot.<ref name="GameSpot"/> [[IGN]] described the sound as "convincing enough, with realistic battle noises throughout the game's various ages. Each type of attack makes a particular sound and, after a while, you can develop a good sense of the scope of a given battle just by listening to it". IGN gave the sound 7 out of 10 overall, but did have some criticism, remarking that "A few glitches detract from an otherwise sufficient soundtrack. Voices are decent and the music is good.<ref name="IGN"/>
