'''Pickett's Charge''' was an [[infantry]] assault ordered by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General]] [[Robert E. Lee]] against [[Major General#United States | Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]]'s [[Union Army|Union]] positions on [[Cemetery Ridge]] on [[July 3]], [[1863]], the last day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Its futility was predicted by the charge's commander, [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]], and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the [[Confederate States of America|Southern]] war effort never fully recovered psychologically. The farthest point reached by the attack has been nicknamed the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]].

After Confederate attacks on both Union flanks had failed the day and night before, Lee was determined to strike the Union center on the third day. On the night of [[July 2]], General Meade correctly predicted at a [[council of war]] that Lee would try an attack on his lines in the center the following morning.

The infantry assault was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment that was meant to soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but it was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repulsed with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 44-52.</ref> When asked, years afterward, why his charge at Gettysburg failed, General Pickett said: "I've always thought the Yankees had something to do with it."<ref>Boritt, p. 5.</ref>

==Plans and command structures==

The charge was planned for three Confederate [[division (military)|division]]s, commanded by [[Major General#United States | Maj. Gen.]] [[George Pickett]], [[Brigadier General#United States | Brig. Gen.]] [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]], and Maj. Gen. [[Isaac R. Trimble]], consisting of troops from [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]]'s First Corps and Lt. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]]'s Third Corps. Pettigrew commanded brigades from Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]]'s old division, under [[Colonel (United States) | Col.]] [[Birkett D. Fry]] (Archer's Brigade), Col. [[James K. Marshall]] (Pettigrew's Brigade), Brig. Gen. [[Joseph R. Davis]], and Col. [[John M. Brockenbrough]]. Trimble, commanding Maj. Gen. [[William Dorsey Pender|Dorsey Pender]]'s division, had the brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Alfred M. Scales]] and [[James H. Lane (general)|James H. Lane]]. Two brigades from Maj. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]]'s division (Hill's Corps) were to support the attack on the right flank: Brig. Gen. [[Cadmus M. Wilcox]] and Col. [[David Lang (colonel)|David Lang]] ([[Edward A. Perry|Perry's]] brigade).<ref name=E544>Eicher, pp. 544-46.</ref>

The target of the Confederate assault was the center of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]]'s [[II Corps (ACW)|II Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]]. Directly in the center was the division of Maj. Gen. [[John Gibbon]] with the brigades of Brig. Gen. [[William Harrow]], Col. [[Norman J. Hall]], and Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]]. To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. [[Alexander Hays]], and to the south was Maj. Gen. [[Abner Doubleday]]'s division of the [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]], including the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]] of Brig. Gen. [[George J. Stannard]]. General Meade's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister.<ref name=E544 />

The specific objective of the assault has been the source of historical controversy. Traditionally, the "[[copse]] of trees" on Cemetery Ridge has been cited as the visual landmark for the attacking force. Historical treatments such as the 1993 film [[Gettysburg (film)|''Gettysburg'']] continue to popularize this view, which originated in the work of [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] historian [[John B. Bachelder]] in the 1880s. However, recent scholarship, including published works by some Gettysburg National Military Park historians, has suggested that Lee's goal was actually Ziegler's Grove on Cemetery Hill, a more prominent and highly visible grouping of trees about 300 yards (300&nbsp;m) north of the copse. The much debated theory suggests that Lee's general plan for the second-day attacks (the seizure of Cemetery Hill) had not changed on the third day, and the attacks on [[July 3]] were also aimed at securing the hill and the network of roads it commanded. The copse of trees, currently a prominent landmark, was under ten feet (3&nbsp;m) high in 1863, only visible to a portion of the attacking columns from certain parts of the battlefield.<ref>Harman, pp. 63-83.</ref>      

From the beginning of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A.P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on [[July 1]] and not at all on [[July 2]]. However, troops that ''had'' done heavy fighting on [[July 1]] ended up making the charge.<ref>Coddington, pp. 461, 489.</ref>

Although the assault is known to popular history as ''Pickett's Charge'', overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett was one of his divisional commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name ''Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault'' (or, less frequently, ''Longstreet's Assault'') to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, General Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded about one third of the men and was under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from [[Virginia]], with the other divisions consisting of troops from [[North Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and [[Florida]].<ref>Eicher, p. 544.</ref>

In conjunction with the infantry assault, Lee planned a cavalry action in the Union rear. Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]] led his cavalry division to the east, prepared to exploit Lee's hoped-for breakthrough by attacking the Union rear and disrupting its line of communications (and retreat) along the Baltimore Pike.<ref>Sears, p. 391.</ref>

Despite Lee's hope for an early start, it took all morning to arrange the infantry assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake.<ref>Wert, pp. 98-99.</ref> Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.<ref>Gallagher, p. 141.</ref>

Meanwhile, on the far right end of the Union line, a seven-hour battle raged for the control of [[Culp's Hill]]. Lee's intent was to synchronize his offensives across the battlefield, keeping Meade from concentrating his numerically superior force, but the assaults were poorly coordinated and Maj. Gen. [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward "Allegheny" Johnson's]] attacks against Culp's Hill petered out just as Longstreet's cannonade began.<ref>Coddington, pp. 454-55.</ref>

==Artillery barrage==
The infantry charge was preceded by what General Lee hoped would be a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralize the Union infantry. But a combination of inept artillery leadership and defective equipment doomed the barrage from the beginning. Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander]], was in effective command of the field; Lee's artillery chief, Maj. Gen. [[William N. Pendleton]], played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps. Despite Alexander's efforts, then, there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective.<ref>Sears, pp. 377-80; Wert, p. 127; Coddington, p. 485.</ref>

The [[July 3]] bombardment was likely the largest of the war,<ref>Symonds, p. 214: "It may well have been the loudest man-made sound on the North American continent until the detonation of the first [[atomic bomb]] at [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].</ref> with hundreds of cannons from both sides firing along the lines for almost two hours,<ref>Hess, p. 162, disputes the two hour duration, writing that the bombardment was essentially over by 2 p.m.</ref> starting around 1 p.m. Confederate guns numbered between 150 and 170<ref>Estimates of the guns deployed vary. Coddington, p. 493: "over 150"; Eicher, p. 543: 159; Trudeau, p. 452: 164; Symonds, p. 215: "more than 160"; Clark, p. 128, "about 170"; Pfanz, p. 45: "170 (we cannot know the exact number)." All agree that approximately 80 guns available in the Army of Northern Virginia were ''not'' used during the bombardment.</ref> and fired from a line over two miles (3&nbsp;km) long, starting in the south at the Peach Orchard and running roughly parallel to the Emmitsburg Road. Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]] wrote, "The cannonade in the center&nbsp;... presented one of the most magnificent battle-scenes witnessed during the war. Looking up the valley towards Gettysburg, the hills on either side were capped with crowns of flame and smoke, as 300 guns, about equally divided between the two ridges, vomited their iron hail upon each other."<ref>Eicher, p. 543.</ref>

Despite its ferocity, the fire was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often overshot the infantry front lines, and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. [[Henry Jackson Hunt|Henry J. Hunt]] had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, and Alexander interpreted this to mean that many of the batteries had been destroyed. (Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of General Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down under Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery&mdash;the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.)<ref>Sears, pp. 397-400; Coddington, p. 497; Hess, pp. 180-81; Clark, p. 135.</ref>

The day was hot, 87&nbsp;°F (31&nbsp;°C) by one account<ref>Sears, p. 383. The temperature was recorded at 2 p.m. by Professor Michael Jacobs of [[Gettysburg College]].</ref> and humid, and the Confederates suffered under the hot sun and from the Union counter-battery fire as they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of [[Seminary Ridge]] or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began.<ref>Hess, p. 151.</ref>

From the beginning, Longstreet opposed the charge, preferring his own plan for a strategic movement around the Union left flank. He claims to have told Lee:

{{cquote|General, I have been a soldier all my life. I have been with soldiers engaged in fights by couples, by squads, companies, regiments, divisions, and armies, and should know, as well as any one, what soldiers can do. It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever arranged for battle can take that position.<ref>Wert, p. 283.</ref>}}

Longstreet looked for ways to avoid ordering the charge by attempting to pass responsibility to young Col. Alexander, but he eventually did give the order himself non-verbally; when Alexander notified Pickett that he was running dangerously short of ammunition, Longstreet nodded reluctantly to Pickett's request to step off. For Pickett, there was virtually no Confederate artillery with ammunition available to support his assault directly.<ref>Coddington, pp. 500-02.</ref>

==Infantry assault==
[[Image:High_Water_Mark_-_Cemetery_Ridge,_Gettysburg_Battlefield.jpg|thumb|left|Cemetery Ridge]]
The entire force that stepped off toward the Union positions consisted of about 12,500 men.<ref>Estimates vary substantially. Clark, p. 131: 12,000; Sauers, p. 835: 10,500 to 15,000; Eicher, p. 544: 10,500 to 13,000; Sears, p. 392: "13,000 or so"; Pfanz, p. 44: "about 12,000"; Coddington, p. 462: 13,500; Hess, p. 335: 11,830.</ref> Although the attack is popularly called a "charge", the men marched deliberately in line with Pettigrew and Trimble on the left, and Pickett to the right. The nine brigades of men stretched over a mile-long (1,600&nbsp;m) front. The Confederates encountered heavy artillery fire while advancing across open fields nearly a mile to reach the Union line. The ground between Seminary Ridge and Cemetery Ridge is slightly undulating, and the advancing troops periodically disappeared from the view of the Union cannoneers. As the three Confederate divisions advanced, awaiting Union soldiers began shouting "Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!" in reference to the disastrous Union advance on the Confederate line during the 1862 [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. Fire from Lt. Col. [[Freeman McGilvery]]'s concealed artillery positions north of [[Little Round Top]] raked the Confederate right flank, while the artillery fire from Cemetery Hill hit the left. Shell and solid shot in the beginning turned to [[canister shot|canister]] and [[musket]] fire as the Confederates came within 400&nbsp;yards of the Union line. The mile-long front shrank to less than half a mile (800&nbsp;m) as the men filled in gaps that appeared throughout the line and followed the natural tendency to move away from the flanking fire.<ref>Hess, p. 171; Clark, p. 137; Sears, pp. 424-26.</ref>

On the left flank of the attack, Brockenbrough's brigade was decimated by artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the [[8th Ohio Infantry]] regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough's Virginians&mdash;already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire&mdash;that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble's division and causing many of his men to bolt as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew's division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew's men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays's division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up as many as four deep, exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload.<ref>Sears, pp. 422-25, 429-31; Hess, pp. 188-90.</ref>

Trimble's division of two brigades followed Pettigrew's, but made poor progress. Confusing orders from Trimble caused Lane to send only 3 1/2 of his North Carolina regiments forward. Renewed fire from the 8th Ohio and the onslaught of Hays's riflemen prevented most of these men from getting past the Emmitsburg Road. Scales's North Carolina brigade, led by Col. William L. J. Lowrance, started with a heavier disadvantage&mdash;they had lost almost two thirds of their men on [[July 1]]. They were also driven back and Lowrance was wounded. The Union defenders also took casualties, but Hays encouraged his men by riding back and forth just behind the battle line, shouting "Hurrah! Boys, we're giving them hell!". Two horses were shot out from under him. Historian Stephen W. Sears calls Hays's performance "inspiring".<ref>Sears, pp. 434-35.</ref>

[[Image:Armistead's last stand.png|thumb|This monument on the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] marks the approximate place where Armistead was killed. The wall behind the monument marks the Union lines.]]
On the right flank, Pickett's Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg Road and wheeled partially to their left to face northeast. They marched in two lines, led by the brigades of Brig. Gen. [[James L. Kemper]] on the right and Brig. Gen. [[Richard B. Garnett]] on the left; Brig. Gen. [[Lewis A. Armistead]]'s brigade followed closely behind. As the division wheeled to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery's guns and the front of Doubleday's Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard's Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper's brigade. At about this time, General Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled.<ref>Clark, pp. 139-43; Pfanz, p. 51; Sears, pp. 436-39.</ref>

As Pickett's men advanced, they withstood the defensive fire of first Stannard's brigade, then Harrow's, and then Hall's, before approaching a minor salient in the Union center, a low stone wall taking an 80-yard right-angle turn known afterwards as "The Angle." It was defended by Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]]'s [[Philadelphia Brigade]]. Webb placed the two remaining guns of (the severely wounded) Lt. Alonzo Cushing's Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery, at the front of his line at the stone fence, with the 69th and 71st Pennsylvania regiments to defend the fence and the guns. The two guns and 940 men could not match the massive firepower that Hays's division, to their right, had been able to unleash.<ref>Sears, pp. 436-43;.</ref>

Two gaps opened up in the Union line: the commander of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall's brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. In the latter case, this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent artillery battery to face the oncoming infantry. Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt, Cowan ordered five guns to fire double canister simultaneously. The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared. The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania, however, was more serious, leaving only a handful of the 71st, 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania, and Cushing's two guns to receive the 2,500 to 3,000 men of Garnett's and Armistead's brigades as they began to cross the stone fence. The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a [[melee]] of rifle fire, bayonets, and fists. Webb, mortified that the 71st had retreated, brought the 72nd Pennsylvania (a [[Zouave]] regiment) forward, stabilizing the line. During the fight, the severely wounded Cushing was killed as he shouted to his men, three bullets striking him, the third in his mouth. The Confederates seized his guns and turned them to face the Union troops, but they had no ammunition to fire. As more Union reinforcements arrived, the defensive line became impregnable and the Confederates began to slip away individually, with no senior officers remaining to call a formal retreat.<ref>Sears, pp. 444-54; Hess, pp. 245, 271-76; Wert, pp. 212-13.</ref>

The infantry assault lasted less than an hour. The supporting attack by Wilcox and Lang on Pickett's right was never a factor; they did not approach the Union line until after Pickett was defeated, and their advance was quickly broken up by McGilvery's guns and by the Vermont Brigade.<ref>Eicher, pp. 547-48; Sears, pp. 451-54.</ref>

==Aftermath==
Pickett's Charge was a bloodbath. While the Union lost about 1,500 killed and wounded, the Confederate casualty rate was over 50%. Pickett's division suffered 2,655 casualties (498 killed, 643 wounded, 833 wounded and captured, and 681 captured, unwounded). Pettigrew's losses are estimated to be about 2,700 (470 killed, 1,893 wounded, 337 captured). Trimble's two brigades lost 885 (155 killed, 650 wounded, and 80 captured). Wilcox's [[brigade]] reported losses of 200, Lang's about 400. Thus, total losses during the attack were 6,555, of which at least 1,123 Confederates were killed on the battlefield, 4,019 were wounded, and a good number of the injured were also captured. Confederate prisoner totals are difficult to estimate from their reports; Union reports indicated that 3,750 men were captured.<ref>Hess, pp. 333-35. Sears, p. 467.</ref>

Command losses were also horrendous. Pickett's three brigade commanders and all thirteen of his [[regiment]]al commanders were casualties. Kemper was wounded seriously, captured by Union soldiers, rescued, and then captured again during the retreat to Virginia. Garnett and Armistead were killed. Garnett had a previous leg injury and rode his horse during the charge, despite knowing that conspicuously riding a horse into heavy enemy fire would mean certain death. Armistead is known for leading his brigade with his cap on the tip of his sword. His brigade made the farthest progress through the Union lines. He was mortally wounded, falling near "The Angle" at what is now called the [[High Water Mark of the Confederacy]]. Of the 15 regimental commanders in Pickett's division, the [[Virginia Military Institute]] produced eleven and all eleven were lost&mdash;six killed, five wounded. Trimble and Pettigrew were the most senior casualties of the day; Trimble lost a leg, and Pettigrew received a minor wound to the hand (only to die from a bullet to the abdomen suffered in a minor skirmish during the retreat to Virginia).<ref>Sears, p. 467; Eicher, pp. 548-49.</ref>

Stuart's cavalry action in indirect support of the infantry assault was unsuccessful. He was met and stopped by Union cavalry about three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the east, in [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles#East Cavalry Field|East Cavalry Field]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 52-53.</ref>

As soldiers straggled back to the Confederate lines along Seminary Ridge, Lee feared a Union counteroffensive and tried to rally his center, telling returning soldiers and Gen. Wilcox that the failure was "all my fault." General Pickett was inconsolable for the rest of the day and never forgave Lee for ordering the charge. When Lee told Pickett to rally his division for the defense, Pickett allegedly replied, "General Lee, I have no division."<ref>Hess, p. 326; Sears, p. 458; Wert, pp. 251-2, disputes prevalent accounts that Lee and Pickett met personally after the battle.</ref>

The Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was exhausted and nearly as damaged at the end of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On [[July 4]], the armies observed an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] accepted the surrender of the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] garrison along the [[Mississippi River]], splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the [[Turning Point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the Civil War.<ref>Pfanz, p. 53.</ref>

History may never know the true story of Lee's intentions at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.<ref>Wert, p. 297.</ref>

Virginian newspapers praised Pickett's Virginia division as making the most progress during the charge, and the papers used Pickett's comparative success as a means of criticizing the actions of the other states' troops during the charge. It was this publicity that played a significant factor in selecting the name Pickett's Charge. Pickett's military career was never the same after the charge, and he was displeased about having his name attached to the repulsed charge. In particular North Carolinians have long taken exception to the characterizations and point to the poor performance of Brockenbrough's Virginians in the advance as a major causative factor of failure.<ref>Desjardins, p. 47; Sears, p. 359.</ref>

Some controversy developed after the battle about the location of  Pickett during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film [[Gettysburg (film)|''Gettysburg'']] depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, but there is no historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would "lead from the rear", while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front, and while this was often violated, there was nothing for Pickett to be ashamed about if he coordinated his forces from behind.<ref>Sears, pp. 426, 455; Coddington, pp. 504-05.</ref>

Pickett's Charge became one of the iconic symbols of the literary and cultural movement known as the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]. [[William Faulkner]], the quintessential Southern novelist, summed up the picture in Southern memory of this gallant but futile episode:<ref>Quoted in Desjardins, pp. 124-25.</ref>

{{Quotation|For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreet to give the word and it's all in the balance, it hasn't happened yet, it hasn't even begun yet, it not only hasn't begun yet but there is still time for it not to begin against that position and those circumstances which made more men than Garnett and Kemper and Armistead and Wilcox look grave yet it's going to begin, we all know that, we have come too far with too much at stake and that moment doesn't need even a fourteen-year-old boy to think This time.

==The battlefield today==
[[Image:High Water Mark from Gettysburg.PNG|thumb|A small portion of the Gettysburg Cyclorama.]]
The site of Pickett's Charge is one of the best-maintained portions of the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]]. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The [[National Park Service]] maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of the Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands ''between'' the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault&mdash;Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from further south.<ref>Harman, pp. 77, 116; Sears, map, p. 427.</ref>

A [[cyclorama]] painting by the French artist [[Paul Philippoteaux]] entitled ''The Battle of Gettysburg'', also known as the [[Gettysburg Cyclorama]], depicts Pickett's Charge from the vantage point of the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge. Completed and first exhibited in 1883, it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States. It is currently being restored and will be relocated to the new National Park Service Visitor Center in 2008.<ref>{{cite web | last = Heiser | first = John | title = The Gettysburg Cyclorama | work = [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] | publisher = National Park Service | date = 2005 | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/gettcyclo.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-21}}</ref>
