'''André Derain''' (10 June 1880 – 8 September 1954) was a French painter and co-founder of [[Fauvism]] with [[Henri Matisse]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fauv/hd_fauv.htm |title=Fauvism |accessdate=2007-12-17 |last=Sabine |first=Rewald |publisher=from ''Timeline of Art History''.

André Derain was born in 1880 in [[Chatou]], [[Yvelines]], [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]], just outside Paris. In 1898, while studying to be an engineer at the Académie Camillo,<ref>Cowling and Mundy, 1990, p.92</ref> he attended painting classes under [[Eugène Carrière]], and there met [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]]. In 1900, he met and shared a studio with [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and began to paint his first [[Landscape art|landscapes]].  His studies were interrupted from 1901 to 1904 when he was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the French army.  Following his release from service, Matisse persuaded Derain's parents to allow him to abandon his engineering career and devote himself solely to painting; subsequently Derain attended the [[Académie Julian]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/international/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?ViewID=1&MnuID=2&GalID=4&SubViewID=1&BioArtistIRN=12005&IRN=98696 |title=International Painting and Sculpture - Le Cavalier au cheval blanc |accessdate=2007-12-17 |publisher=National Gallery of Australia }}</ref>

Derain and Matisse worked together through the summer of 1905 in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] village of [[Collioure]] and later that year displayed their highly innovative paintings at the [[Salon d'Automne]]. The vivid, unnatural colors led the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to derisively dub their works as ''[[les Fauves]]'', or "the wild beasts", marking the start of the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] movement. In March 1906, the noted art dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] sent Derain to London to compose a series of paintings with the city as subject. In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain put forth a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] or [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. With bold colors and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the [[Thames]] and [[Tower Bridge]]. These London paintings remain among his most popular work. 

In 1907 art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] purchased Derain's entire studio, granting Derain financial stability. He experimented with stone sculpture and moved to [[Montmartre]] to be near his friend [[Pablo Picasso]] and other noted artists. Fernande Olivier, Picasso's mistress at the time, described Derain<ref name="Cle396">Clement, 1994, p.396</ref> as

{{Cquote2|quotetext=Slim, elegant, with a lively colour and enamelled black hair. With an English chic, somewhat striking. Fancy waistcoats, ties in crude colours, red and green. Always a pipe in his mouth, phlegmatic, mocking, cold, an arguer.}}

At Montmartre, Derain began to shift from the brilliant Fauvist palette to more muted tones, showing the influence of [[Cubism]] and [[Paul Cézanne]].<ref name="GH"> {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheimlasvegas.org/past/exhibition_187_work_md_575.html |title=Works on View: André Derain |accessdate=2007-12-18 |publisher=Guggenheim Hermitage Museum }}</ref> Derain supplied woodcuts in [[Primitivism|primitivist]] style for an edition of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s first book of prose, ''[[L'enchanteur pourrissant]]'' (1909).  He displayed works at the [[Neue Künstlervereinigung]] in [[Munich]] in 1910,<ref>Hamilton, 1993, p.207</ref>, in 1912 at the secessionist [[Der Blaue Reiter]]<ref>Sotriffer, 1972, p.59</ref> and in 1913 at the seminal [[Armory Show]] in New York. He also illustrated a collection of poems by [[Max Jacob]] in 1912.

At about this time Derain's work began overtly reflecting his study of the [[Old Masters|old masters]]. The role of color was reduced and forms became austere; the years 1911-1914 are sometimes referred to as his [[Gothic art|gothic]] period. In 1914 he was mobilized for military service in [[World War I]] and until his release in 1919 he would have little time for painting, although in 1916 he provided a set of illustrations for [[André Breton]]'s first book, ''Mont de Piete''.

After the war, Derain won new acclaim as a leader of the renewed [[classicism]] then ascendant. With the wildness of his Fauve years far behind, he was admired as an upholder of tradition.<ref>Cowling and Mundy, 1990, pp.92-93</ref> In 1919 he designed the [[ballet]] ''[[La Boutique fantasque]]'' for [[Serge Diaghilev|Diaghilev]], leader of the [[Ballets Russes]].<ref name="australiadancing">[http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/4861.html australiadancing] </ref> A major success, it would lead to his creating many ballet designs.

The 1920s marked the height of his success, as he was awarded the [[Carnegie Prize]] in 1928 and began to exhibit extensively abroad — in London, Berlin, [[Frankfurt]], [[Düsseldorf]], New York City and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name="Cle396"/>  

During the German occupation of France in [[World War II]], Derain lived primarily in Paris and was much courted by the Germans because he represented the prestige of French culture. Derain accepted an invitation to make an official visit to Germany in 1941, traveling with other French artists to Berlin to attend an exhibition by [[Nazism|Nazi]] sculptor [[Arno Breker]].<ref name="GH"/> The Nazi [[propaganda]] machine naturally made much of Derain's presence in Germany, and after the [[Liberation]] he was branded a collaborator and ostracized by many former supporters.

A year before his death, he contracted an eye infection from which he never fully recovered. He died in [[Garches]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]], France in 1954 when he was struck by a moving vehicle.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.andre-derain.de/e/index.shtml |title=André Derain Biography |accessdate=2008-01-03 |work=Namen der Kunst |publisher=Art Directory GmbH }}</ref>

Today, paintings by Derain sell for as much as US$6 million. The London paintings were the subject of a major exhibition at the [[Courtauld Institute]] in 2005-06.
