The image of '''Our Lady of Guadalupe''', also called  the '''Virgin of Guadalupe''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe'' or ''La Virgen de Guadalupe''; sometimes called by the familiar '''''Lupita''''') is a 16th-century [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[icon]] of the Virgin Mary. It is Mexico's most popular religious and and one of its most famous cultural images. The feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe is celebrated on [[December 12]], commemorating traditional accounts of her appearances to [[Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin]] on the hill of [[Tepeyac]] near [[Mexico City]] from [[December 9]] through [[December 12]], [[1531]].

The image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is a symbol important to Mexican identity and some people even consider her as "Empress of the Americas". 


===History===
===Traditional account of the apparition===
[[Image:Posada guadalupe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Etching by Jose Guadalupe Posada, depicting St. Juan Diego and the Virgin image miraculous imprinted on the cloth where he collected the roses.]]
[[Image:Juan de Zumarraga.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Spanish bishop, Fray [[Juan de Zumárraga]] did not believe [[Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin|Juan Diego]]'s account and asked for a [[miracle]].]]
According to Catholic accounts of the Guadalupan apparition, during a walk from his village to the city on [[December 9]], [[1531]], [[Juan Diego]] saw a vision of a [[Virgin]] at the Hill of [[Tepeyac]]. Speaking in [[Nahuatl]], Our Lady of Guadalupe said to build an [[abbey]] on the site, but when [[Juan Diego]] spoke to the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[bishop]], Fray [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the prelate asked for a miraculous sign. So the Virgin told Juan Diego to gather [[flower]]s from the hill, even though it was [[winter]], when normally nothing bloomed. He found Spanish [[rose]]s, gathered them on his [[Tilmàtli|tilma]], and presented these to the bishop. According to the legend, when the roses fell from it an [[icon]] of the Guadalupe remained imprinted on the cloth. 

===Documentation===
A number of primary historical documents are used to support this apparition account, including: the Nahuatl-language ''[[Huei tlamahuiçoltica]]'' or [[Nican mopohua]] ("here it is recounted"), a tract about the Virgin which contains the aforementioned story, and which was printed in 1649; a Spanish-language book about the apparitions titled ''Imagen de la Virgen María'' ("Image of the Virgin Mary"), printed in 1648; a seventeenth-century [[Stradanus engraving|engraving by Samuel Stradanus]] which used the Virgin's image to advertise [[indulgences]];  and the [[Codex Escalada]], a pictographic account of the Virgin on [[Tepeyac]], printed on deerskin and said to date back to 1548.<ref>"Our Lady of Guadalupe.  Historical sources."  L'Osservatore Romano.  23 January 2002, page 8</ref>

[[Image:Huei-tlamahuicoltica.png|thumb|right|150px|First page of the Nican Mopohua.]]

The apparition account is also strengthened by a document called the ''Informaciones Jurídicas'' of 1666, a collection of oral interviews gathered near Juan Diego's hometown of [[Cuautitlan]].  In the "Informaciones Jurídicas," various witnesses affirmed, in interview format, basic details about Saint Juan Diego and the Guadalupan apparition story.<ref name="poole">Poole, Stafford. Our Lady of Guadalupe. The Origins and Sources of a Mexican National Symbol, 1531-1797. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1995.</ref>

Some historians and clerics, including the U.S. priest-historian [[Fr.Stafford Poole]], the famous Mexican historian [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]], and former abbot of the [[Basilica of Guadalupe]], [[Guillermo Schulenburg]], have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the apparition accounts.  Schulenburg in particular caused a stir with his 1996 interview with the [[Catholic]] magazine ''Ixthus,'' when he said that Juan Diego was "a symbol, not a reality." <ref> Daily Catholic.  December 7, 1999.  [http://www.dailycatholic.org/issue/archives/1999Dec/232dec7,vol.10,no.232txt/dec7nv4.htm], accessed November 30, 2006 </ref><ref>Schulenburg was not the first to disbelieve the traditional account nor the first Catholic prelate to resign his post after questioning the Guadalupe story.  In [[1897]] Eduardo Sanchez Camacho, the [[Bishop]] of [[Tamaulipas]] was forced to leave his post after expressing similar disbelief.  "Divided by an Apparition."  New York Times.  September 5, 1896;  p. 3</ref>

One problem with the apparition tradition is that Juan Diego is said to have met the Virgin in 1531, while the earliest account about their meeting was published in 1648. When discussing the 117-year gap between the apparition and written accounts describing it, apparition believers point to the [[Codex Escalada]], a recently-discovered document which illustrates the Tepeyac apparition and which dates to 1548.  The document, a painting on deerskin which illustrates the apparition and discusses [[Juan Diego]]'s death, was used to shore up [[Juan Diego]]'s 1990s [[canonization]] process.  Critics, including [[Stafford Poole]] and [[David A. Brading]], find the document suspicious -- partly because of when it was discovered, and partly because it contains the handiwork of both [[Antonio Valeriano]] (a man many apparition partisans believe to be the true author of the [[Nican mopohua]]) and the signature of [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], the [[Franciscan]] missionary and anthropologist.  Brading said that 
[[Image:Codice1548 chico.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Codex Escalada.]]
<blockquote>Within the context of the Christian tradition, it was rather like finding a picture of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]'s vision of [[Christ]] on the road to [[Damascus]], drawn by [[St. Luke]] and signed by [[St. Peter]].<ref name="brading"/></blockquote> However, Brading's quip rather than leading to unbelief might be the confirmation of authenticity needed, as it brings to light the difference between St. Luke and St. Paul on one hand; and Valeriano and Sahagún on the other in a simple question: what reason could the first party of Luke and Paul have had to: first, draw the vision; and then, sign the drawing? None of course, absolutely none! What about Valeriano and Sahagún? Valeriano had very good and commonplace reasons. You see, Valeriano was a Colonial authority dependent on the Viceroy. He began as Governor of San Juan, and on proof of his great personal competence he was appointed as Governor to all Mexican Indians, a post he held for 35 years. So, in his official capacity he had the Official Seal of Authenticity on these matters. It would have been one of the most commonplace operations of his job. How about Sahagún? Valeriano, a bright Indian had to learn from somebody, and had many competent teachers, but historically, it was Sahagún to whom he had a permanent lifelong attachment, and gratitude. Besides, Mr. Brading, attaching two signatures is normally required by law! There may have been more copies similarly signed on demand, together with other documents, requested by local and foreign monasteries and their librarians. The centuries elapsed plus wanton destruction have devastated libraries in Europe (See Walsh, Philip the II, for abundant information on this)and elsewhere. So, when believers in the Codex counter that the Codex has been vetted by scientific tests which prove it is an authentic 16th-century document, you can bet your life it's true[[Luisosio]] 05:31, 27 July 2007 (UTC).<ref>Zwick, Mark and Louise. "Why San Juan Diego, a Saint for Nobodies, Means So Much to the Houston Catholic Worker."  Houston Catholic Worker newspaper, September-October 2002 [http://www.cjd.org/paper/jdiego.html]</ref>

[[Juan de Zumárraga|Zumárraga]] was supposedly silent on the topic of the apparition: as there is no extant mention of Juan Diego nor the Virgin in any of his conserved writings, with one exception, an exultant letter of his to Hernán Cortez which though unsigned with his name, is signed as follows: "De V.S. Capellán, El electo regocijado" - meaning "The rejoicing chosen one (chosen by the Virgin), and Chaplain to your Lordship", and which refers, in 1531, to the festivity of The Imaculate Conception which was celebrated from December 8th to December 17th according to the Sevillian Missal then in use in Mexico (Nine days of festivities in which the apparitions from the 9th to the 12th are comprised) The following phrase in the letter: "The great mercy which God and His mother have made to this land you conquered" cannot refer to any other great mercy for there was none other. This letter was published in the "Album Histórico Guadalupano del IV Centenario" in 1931 by the prominent historian Mariano Cuevas S.J. It is also certain that he did inform on the apparitions officialy, as there were witnesses to the fact, and was also established canonically by the Informations of 1666. Additionaly, there is a testimony by Pedro Mezquía of a copy being kept in the monastery of Vitoria in Spain many years later[[Luisosio]] 05:31, 27 July 2007 (UTC). In a catechism published in Mexico before his death[[Luisosio]] 05:31, 27 July 2007 (UTC), it was stated: “The Redeemer of the world doesn’t want any more [[miracle]]s, because they are no longer necessary.<ref name="poole"/>”. In this quotation from a catechism, some critics have pretended to read a personal denial of the apparitions which is absurd, as the author is not Zumárraga, and was not even a first printing; all to the contrary, this was a reprint of an old Spanish cathechism just as it was imported from Spain[[Luisosio]] 05:31, 27 July 2007 (UTC). Furthermore, in 1531 [[Juan de Zumárraga|Zumárraga]] was not Mexico's [[Archbishop]] but merely Bishop-elect, thus officialy a bishop: he would not be consecrated until [[1533]] and became an Archbishop until 1547.<ref>"Juan de Zumarraga."  Catholic Encyclopedia.  [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15767a.htm], accessed 11 December 2006</ref>

Guillermo Schulenburg, the Basílica's abbot for over 30 years, declared in 1996 Juan Diego as a symbol and myth, a constructed character made to conquer the hearts of the native people and redirect their relgious allegiance to Christianity and the Vatican. He also commissioned a serious study, "out of sheer love for truth", which demonstrates the Lady of Guadalupe as a man-made painting, with no supernatural elements whatsoever. There is ample evidence of a 16th century shrine to Guadalupe at Tepeyac:  however skeptics contend that this shrine was dedicated to the Spanish icon [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Extremadura)|Our Lady of Guadalupe in Extremadura]]. By this admision of dishonesty (As he made millions pretending to be a believer in his official post) Guillermo Schulemburg has lost personal credibility on all matters in Mexico[[Luisosio]] 05:31, 27 July 2007 (UTC).

As documentation goes, and even to give a correct appraisal much, much more would have to be added. The Shrine of the Virgin in Mexico City is the world's most visited shrine with St. Peter's of Rome coming in second. It should be obvious that doubtful apparitions are not successful, least of all to this extent. Fundamental appreciations must follow historical logic. We are discussing the XVI Century, not the XX. Undue weight is given to printing, which is interesting as Mexico had the first printing press in the Continent, but there was not much of a book market, least of all for presenting what everybody new by word of mouth. Paper was not locally produced, thus when scarcity made itself felt with high prices, archives were stolen to sell fireworks which were, even by 1666, one of the main uses for paper. Thus, despite correcting several historical entries as a researcher in the field I realize the enormous job still pending. That you may get a feeling for the universe of Guadalupean studies I would suggest you visit my blog: www.veritasliberabit.blogspot.com in English. For Spanish, a different approach is presented in www.ennombredeguadalupe.blogspot.com[[Luisosio]] 05:31, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

==Controversies==

[[Image:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Eighteenth-century painting of God illustrating the Guadalupe]]
As early as [[1556]] Francisco de Bustamante, head of the Colony's [[Franciscans]], delivered a sermon disparaging the holy origins of the painting: <blockquote>“The devotion that has been growing in a chapel dedicated to Our Lady, called of Guadalupe, in this city is greatly harmful for the natives, because it makes them believe that the image painted by Marcos the Indian is in any way miraculous.<ref>"Marcos" may have referred to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active in Mexico when the icon appeared.</ref><ref name="poole"/>”</blockquote>

In 1611 the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Martin de Leon, fourth viceroy of Mexico, denounced the cult of the Virgin of Guadalupe as a disguised worship of the Aztec goddess [[Tonantzin]].<ref name="poole"/> The missionary and anthropologist [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] held the same opinion:  he wrote that the shrine at [[Tepeyac]] was extremely popular but worrisome because people called the Virgin of Guadalupe [[Tonantzin]].  Sahagún said that the worshipers claimed that [[Tonantzin]] was the proper [[Nahuatl]] for "Mother of God" -- but he disagreed, saying that "Mother of God" in [[Nahuatl]] would be "Dios y Nantzin."<ref>"Fray Bernaerdino de Sagahun y el culto de Guadalupe." Proyecto Guadalupano [http://www.proyectoguadalupe.com/documentos/sahagun.html], accessed 1 December 2006</ref>

In 2002, art restoration expert José Sol Rosales examined the icon with a [[stereomicroscope]] and identified [[calcium sulfate]], pine soot, white, blue, and green "tierras" (soil), reds made from [[carmine]] and other pigments, as well as [[gold]]. Rosales said he found the work consistent with 16th century materials and methods.<ref>Vera, Rodrigo. "La Guadalupana, tres imagenes en uno." ''Proceso'', May 25 2002.

[[Norberto Rivera Carrera]], Archbishop of [[Mexico]], commissioned a 1999 study to test the tilma's age.  The researcher, [[Leoncio Garza-Valdés]], had previously worked with the Shroud of Turin. Upon inspection [[Garza-Valdés]] found three distinct layers in the painting, at least one of which was signed and dated.  He also said that the original painting showed striking similarities to the original [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Extremadura)|Lady of Guadalupe]] found in [[Extremadura]] Spain, and that the second painting showed another Virgin with indigenous features. Finally, [[Garza-Valdés]] indicated that the fabric on which the icon is painted is made of conventional [[hemp]] and [[linen]], not [[agave]] fibers as is popularly believed.<ref>Vera, Rodrigo.

[http://www.sectas.org/Secciones_Especiales/canonizacion/guadalupana.htm], accessed 5 December 2006</ref>  The photographs of these putative overpaintings were not available in the Garza-Valdés 2002 publication, however.<ref>Peterson, Jeannette Favot.

Vol. 51, Issue 4, p. 39. 1992</ref> [[Gilberto Aguirre]] a San Antonio optometrist and colleague of [[Garza-Valdés]] who also took part in the 1999 study, examined the same photographs and stated that, while agreeing the painting had been tampered with, he disagreed with Garza-Valdes' conclusions. [[Gilberto Aguirre]] claims the conditions for conducting the study were inadequate. No control of the lighting and the fact that the painting was shot through an acrylic plate scientifically invalidates any results. He also questions [[Garza-Valdés']] claim of ultraviolet light revealing two underlying images because according to [[Aguirre]], ultraviolet light can't penetrate sub-surfaces. The team did take Infrared pictures but those didn't show additional images underneath the present one. <ref>Ashburne, Elyse.  "Catholic relic's authenticity questioned by researcher."

Similar Marian apparitions have been reported in many cities and towns throughout [[Mexico]]; in the Mexican town of [[Tlaltenango]] in the state of Morelos, a painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe is claimed to have miraculously appeared in the inside of a box that two unknown travelers left in a hostel.  The owners of the hostel called the local priest after noticing enticing aromas of flowers and [[sandalwood]] coming out of the box.  The image has been venerated on September 8 since its finding in 1720, and is accepted as valid apparition by the local Catholic authorities.<ref>Garduño, Thalia Ehrlich.  "Virgen de Tlaltenango."  [http://www.mariologia.org/advocacionesmexico01.htm], accessed 29 November 2006.</ref>.

It is curiously interesting to note that biased people tend to see at least 300 [[Marian apparition|apparition of the Virgin Mary]] every year, as reported to local church authorities, most of them seen in burn-marks in pieces of toast and [[tortilla]]s. In one of the most recent cases, believers have seen a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe in a humidity stain in the [[Mexico City]] [[metro]].  This apparition is called the "Virgin of the Subway."<ref>Monsivais, Carlos. "Estampas al borde de la piedad."

==Symbol of Mexico==
Guadalupe's first major use as a nationalistic symbol was in the writing of [[Miguel Sanchez (writer)|Miguel Sánchez]], the author of the first [[Spanish language]] apparition account.  Sanchez identified Guadalupe as [[Revelation]]'s [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], and said that <blockquote>"this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary...[who had] prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image.<ref name="brading">Brading, D.A. Mexican Phoenix. Our Lady of Guadalupe: Image and Tradition Across Five Centuries. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2001.</ref>"</blockquote>

In 1810 [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his ''[[Grito de Dolores]],'' yelling words to the effect of "[[Death]] to the [[Spaniards]] and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked [[Guanajuato]] and [[Valladolid]], they placed "the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors"  and "they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats.<ref name="krauze">Krauze, Enrique. Mexico, Biography of Power. A History of Modern Mexico 1810-1996. HarperCollins: New York, 1997.</ref>"  Royalists responded by putting Guadalupe's image on the soles of their shoes.<ref>Peterson, Jeannette Favot.  "The Virgin of Guadalupe.  Symbol of Conquest or Liberation?" ''Art Journal.'' Vol. 51, Issue 4, p. 39. 1992</ref>

[[Image:Guadalupano.jpg|Guadalupanflag|thumb|right|250px|Flag carried by Hidalgo and his insurgent army.]]

When Hidalgo died, leadership of the revolution fell to a mestizo priest named [[Jose Maria Morelos]] who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south.  Morelos was also a Guadalupan partisan:  he made the Virgin the seal of his [[Congress of Chilpancingo]], stating <blockquote>"New Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.<ref name="krauze"/>"</blockquote>  He inscribed the Virgin's feast day, [[December 12]], into the [[Chilpancingo]] constitution, and declared that Guadalupe was the power behind his military victories.  One of Morelos' officers, a man named [[Guadalupe Victoria|Felix Fernandez]] who would later become the first Mexican president, even changed his name to Guadalupe Victoria.<ref name="krauze"/>

[[Simón Bolívar]], noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos' death in 1815 wrote: <blockquote>"...the leaders of the independence struggle have put [[fanaticism]] to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their [[flag]]s...the [[veneration]] for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest [[prophet]] might inspire.<ref name="brading"/>"</blockquote>

In 1914,  [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s peasant army rose out of the south against the government of [[Porfirio Diaz]].   Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in [[land reform]] --"tierra y libertad" (land and liberty) was the [[slogan]] of the uprising -- when Zapata's peasant troops penetrated [[Mexico City]], they carried Guadalupan banners. (Documentary footage of Zapata and Pancho Villa's armies entering Mexico City can be seen here [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_wAoEqeHKU] -- Zapata's men can be seen carrying the flag of the Guadalupana about 38 seconds in.)

[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Octavio Paz]] wrote in 1974 that "Mexican people, after more than two centuries of experiments, have faith only in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the [[National Lottery (Mexico)|National Lottery]]"<ref>Paz, Octavio.  Introduction to Jacques Lafaye's ''Quetzalcalcoatl and Guadalupe.  The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness 1531-1813.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1976</ref>

The Virgin of Guadalupe has also symbolized the Mexican nation since Mexico's [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]].  Both [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s armies traveled underneath Guadalupan flags. The Mexican novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]] once said that "...one may no longer consider himself a Christian, but you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe."<ref>Demarest, Donald.  "Guadalupe Cult...In the Lives of Mexicans." p. 114 in ''A Handbook on Guadalupe'', Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate, eds.  Waite Park MN:  Park Press Inc, 1996</ref>

More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army ([[EZLN]]) named their "mobile city" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson [[Subcomandante Marcos]] wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.<ref>Subcomandante Marcos, "Zapatistas Guadalupanos and the Virgin of Guadalupe."  24 March 1995 [http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/mexico/ezln/marcos_virgin_mar95.html], accessed 11 December 2006</ref>

In 1994, the Mexican sculptor [[Eduardo Leal de la Gala]] make a tree dimension version in wood of the Lady of Guadalupe for the Cultural Center of the Mexican Embassy in Paris, France.

===Mestizo culture and Mexican identity===

Guadalupe is often considered a mixture of the cultures which blend to form Mexico, both racially<ref>Beckwith, Barbara.  "A View From the North." St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online.

[[Image:Our Lady of Guadalupe--graffiti in East Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|left|275px|Graffiti mural in Los Angeles showing [[Guadalupe|Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in a [[nopal]] cactus.]]

One theory is that the Virgin of Guadalupe was presented to the [[Aztec]]s as a sort of  "[[Christianization|Christianized]]" [[Tonantzin]], necessary for the clergymen to convert the Indians to their Faith.  As Jacques Lafaye wrote in ''Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe'', "...as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.<ref name="lafay">Lafaye, Jacques.  ''Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe.  The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness.'' Chicago:  University of Chicago Press.  1976</ref>"An alternate view is that Guadalupe-Tonantzin gave the native Americans a hidden method to continue worshipping their own goddess in a Christianized form;  similar patterns of [[syncretic]] worship can be seen throughout the Catholic Americas (e.g. [[Vodun]], [[Santería]]).  Guadalupan religious syncretism is both lauded<ref name="guide"/> and disparaged as demonic<ref>Scheifler, Michael.  "The Aztec Goddess Tonantzin and the Feast of Guadalupe."  Bible Light Homepage.  [http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/aztec.htm], accessed 3 December 2006</ref>.

Some theologians also associate the Virgin of Guadalupe with a special relationship between the indigenous peoples of the American continents and the Catholic Church. This perspective developed as the scriptural terms of truths "hid ... from the wise and prudent" but "revealed...unto babes" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 11:25), but later developed into the "spiritual [[Mestizo|mestizaje]] of the Americas" <ref name="elizondo">Elizondo, Virgil.  ''Guadalupe, Mother of a New Creation.'' Maryknoll, New York: Orbis Books, 1997</ref>, and the "option for the poor" provided by [[Liberation theology]].

The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a "common denominator" uniting Mexicans.  Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of  differences -- linguistic, ethnic, and class-based -- King says "The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole." 
<ref name="king">King, Judy. "La Virgen de Guadalupe -- Mother of All Mexico." [http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/travel/jking/jkguadalupe.html], accessed 29 November 2006</ref>

This sentiment was echoed by two celebrants interviewed in the New York Times at the Virgin's feast day in 1998:  "We say that we are more Guadalupanos than Mexicans," said the Jesuit Brother Joel Magallan. "We say that because our Lady Guadalupe is our symbol, our identity."  David Solanas, another feast-goer, agreed, saying "We have faith in her.  She's like the mama of all the Mexicans." <ref>Herszenhorn, David M. "Mexicans Unite to Honor Their Spiritual Mother." December 13, 1998, New York Times, Section 1, Page 51.</ref>

The origin of the name "Guadalupe" is controversial.  According to a sixteenth-century report the Virgin identified herself as Guadalupe when she appeared to Juan Diego's uncle, [[Juan Bernardino]]<ref>"Why the name 'of Guadalupe'?" sancta.org [http://www.sancta.org/nameguad.html], accessed 30 November 2006</ref>. It has also been suggested that "Guadalupe" is a corruption of a [[Nahuatl]] name "Coatlaxopeuh", which has been translated as "Who Crushes the Serpent.<ref>Mendoza, Rubi.  "Coatlaxopeuh or Guadalupe?"  xispas.com [http://www.xispas.com/archives/virgin/virgin.htm]</ref> In this interpretation, the serpent referred to is [[Quetzalcoatl]], one of the chief [[Aztec mythology|Aztec gods]], whom the Virgin Mary "crushed" by inspiring the conversion of indigenous people to Catholicism.  However, many historians believe that the 1533 Guadalupan shrine was dedicated to the Spanish Lady of Guadalupe in Extremadura -- not to the Mexican Virgin venerated today. Thus, while the name "Guadalupe" would have had certain connotations to Nahuatl speakers, as noted above, its ultimate origins would be the Arabic-Latin term "Wadī Lupum", meaning "Valley of the Wolf".

''María Guadalupe,'' or just ''Lupe,'' is a common female and male name among Mexican people or those with Mexican heritage.

==Religious theories regarding the image==
===Artistic symbolism===
The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is often read as a [[Code (cryptography)|coded]] image. Miguel Sanchez, the author of the 1648 tract ''Imagen de la Virgen María'', described the Virgin's image as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] from the [[New Testament]]'s Revelation 12:1:  "arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars." Mateo de la Cruz, writing twelve years after Sánchez, "argued that the Guadalupe possessed all the iconographical attributes of Mary in her [[Immaculate Conception]]".<ref name="brading"/> Likewise, a 1738 sermon preached by Miguel Picazo argued that the Guadalupe was the "best representation" of the Immaculate Conception.<ref name="brading"/>

[[Image:Virginmaguey2.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Virgin in a maguey.]]

Many writers, including Patricia Harrington and [[Virgil Elizondo]], describe the image as containing coded messages for the [[indigenous people of Mexico]].<ref name="elizondo"/><ref>"The Image." [http://www.interlupe.com.mx/6-e.html], accessed 3 December 2006</ref> <blockquote>"The Aztecs...had an elaborate, coherent symbolic system for making sense of their lives.  When this was destroyed by the Spaniards, something new was needed to fill the void and make sense of New Spain...the image of Guadalupe served that purpose."  <ref>Harrington, Patricia.  "Mother of Death, Mother of Rebirth:  The Virgin of Guadalupe."  ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion.''  Vol. 56, Issue 1, p. 25-50.  1988</ref></blockquote>   Her blue-green [[mantle]] was described as the color once reserved for the divine couple [[Ometecuhtli]] and [[Omecihuatl]]; <ref>"La Virgen de Guadalupe," panam.edu [http://www.panam.edu/dept/lrgvarchive/virgen.html], accessed 30 November 2006</ref> her [[belt]] is read as a sign of [[pregnancy]]; and a cross-shaped image symbolizing the cosmos and called ''[[nahui-ollin]]'' is said to be inscribed beneath the image's sash. <ref>"The Lady of Guadalupe.  An Invented Myth or a Strange Reality?"  laermita.org[http://laermita.org/ladyguad.htm], accessed 30 November 2006</ref>

Yet another interpretation of the image is offered by the historian [[William B. Taylor]], who recounted that Guadalupe has also been "acclaimed goddess of the [[maguey]] <nowiki>[agave]</nowiki>" and [[pulque]] was drunk on her feast day.  A [[1772]] report described the rays of light around Guadalupe as maguey spines.<ref>Taylor, William B. Drinking, Homicide, and Rebellion in Colonial Mexican Villages.

=== Alleged miraculous properties===
Some consider it miraculous that the [[Tilmàtli|tilma]], supposing it's still the original, maintains its structural integrity after nearly 500 years, since a replica of the image was once made, using the same colors and the same material for the tilma, and it lasted only about 15 years before it disintegrated.<ref name="giulio">Guerra, Giulio Dante.  "La Madonna di Guadalupe.  'Inculturazione' Miracolosa." Christianita. n. 205-206, 1992.  [http://www.alleanzacattolica.org/indici/articoli/guerragd205_206.htm], accessed 1 December 2006</ref>In addition to withstanding the elements, the tilma resisted a 1791 ammonia spill that made a considerable hole, which was then completely repaired in two weeks with no external help. In 1921, an anarchist placed an offering of flowers next to the image. A bomb hidden within the flowers exploded and destroyed the shrine. However, the image suffered no damage. <ref>"Our Lady of Guadalupe" livingmiracles.net [http://www.livingmiracles.net/Guadalupe.html], accessed 30 November 2006</ref><ref>"Our Lady of Guadalupe"  catholic.org [http://www.catholic.org/about/guadalupe.php], accessed 30 November 2006</ref>

[[Image:eyedetl.jpg|right|frame|Image somewhat resembling a bearded man found in the Virgin's eye.]]

Photographers and [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] have claimed to locate images reflected in the eyes of the Virgin.<ref> "The Eyes."  Interlupe.  [http://www.interlupe.com.mx/8-e.html], accessed 3 December</ref><ref>"Los Ojos de Guadalupe: Un misterio para la ciencia." fluvium.org, accessed 30 November 2006 [http://www.fluvium.org/textos/lectura/lectura67.htm]</ref> In 1929 and 1951 photographers found a figure reflected in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection they said that the reflection was tripled in what is called the [[Purkinje images|Purkinje effect]].  This effect is commonly found in human eyes.<ref name="giulio"/> The ophthalmologist Dr. Jose Aston Tonsmann later enlarged the image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x [[magnification]] and said he saw not only the aforementioned single figure, but rather images of all the witnesses present when the [[Tilmàtli|tilma]] was shown to the [[Bishop]] in 1531.  Tonsmann also reported seeing a small family -- mother, father, and a group of children -- in the center of the Virgin's eyes.<ref name="giulio"/>

In response to the eye miracles, Joe Nickell and John F. Fischer wrote in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''  that images seen in the Virgin's eyes could be the result of the human tendency to form familiar shapes from random patterns, much like a psychologist's [[Rorschach inkblot test|inkblots]] -- a phenomenon known as [[religious pareidolia]].<ref>Nickell, Joe. "'Miraculous' Image of Guadalupe." Skeptical Briefs, June 2002. [http://www.csicop.org/sb/2002-06/guadalupe.html] accessed 29 November 2006.</ref>

[[Richard Kuhn]], who received the 1938 [[Nobel Prize in chemistry|Nobel Chemistry prize]], is said to have analyzed a sample of the fabric in 1936 and said the tint on the fabric was not from a known mineral, vegetable, or animal source.<ref name="giulio"/>

In 1979 Philip Serna Callahan studied the icon with [[infrared]] light and stated that portions of the face, hands, robe, and mantle had been painted in one step, with no sketches or corrections and no paintbrush strokes.<ref>Sennott, Br. Thomas Mary.  "The Tilma of Guadalupe:  A Scientific Analysis." [http://motherofallpeoples.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=163] </ref>

With the Brief ''Non est equidem'' of [[May 25]] [[1754]], [[Pope Benedict XIV]] declared Our Lady of Guadalupe patron of what was then called New Spain, corresponding to Spanish Central and Northern America, and approved liturgical texts for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[Liturgy of the Hours]] in her honour.  [[Pope Leo XIII]] granted new texts in 1891 and authorized coronation of the image in 1895. [[Pope Pius X|Pope Saint Pius X]] proclaimed her patron of Latin America in 1910. In 1935 [[Pope Pius XI]] proclaimed her patron of the Philippines and had a monument in her honor erected in the Vatican Gardens. In 1966 [[Pope Paul VI]] sent a [[Golden Rose]] to the shrine.<ref name="popes">Notitiae, bulletin of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, 2002, pages 194-195</ref>

[[Pope John Paul II]] visited the shrine in the course of his first journey outside Italy as Pope from 26 to [[January 31]] [[1979]], and again when he beatified Juan Diego there on [[6 May]] [[1990]]. In 1992 he dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe a chapel within [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the Vatican. At the request of the Special Assembly for the Americas of the Synod of Bishops, he named Our Lady of Guadalupe patron of the Americas on [[January 22]] [[1999]] (with the result that her liturgical celebration had, throughout the Americas, the rank of Solemnity), and visited the shrine again on the following day.  On [[July 31]] [[2002]], he canonized Juan Diego, and later that year included in the [[Roman Catholic calendar of saints|General Calendar]] of the [[Roman Rite]], as optional memorials, the liturgical celebrations of Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin ([[December 9]]) and Our Lady of Guadalupe ([[12 December]]).<ref name="popes"/>

Replicas of the tilma can be found in thousands of churches throughout the world, including [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] Cathedral in [[Paris]] and the [[Basilica of Saint Peter]] in [[Rome]], and numerous [[parish]]es bear her name.
