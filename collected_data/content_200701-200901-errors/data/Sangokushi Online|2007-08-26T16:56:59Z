'''Sangokushi Online''' (三國志 Online) is KOEI's 3rd online Romance of the Three Kingdoms game for PC platform.

However Koei set their open beta test to start on September 27, 2007 (Koei [http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sol/obeta_info.htm]).  Additionally, these plans do not reference a possible North American or European release even though the game is developed in a multilingual country.
