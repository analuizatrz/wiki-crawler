== Release history ==
After the success of her first single in [[Australia]], a cover of [[Little Eva]]'s 1962 hit "[[The Loco-Motion (Kylie Minogue song)|Locomotion]]", Minogue was given the go ahead to begin recording her debut album. She headed to [[London, England]]  in the spring of 1988 to work with [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock, Aitken & Waterman]], one of the most successful producing teams of the 1980s and early 90s. The album was released in July 1988 and debuted at number two on both the Australian and [[United Kingdom|UK]] album charts. 

Never before has a debut album by a female artist entered so high on either country's charts. In the UK, Minogue became the youngest female and first Australian artist to top the album chart, reaching the top spot on two separate occasions and remaining there for a staggering eight weeks. It became the highest selling album in the UK in 1988 and the country's fifth biggest selling album of the 1980s. It also remained Kylie's highest selling album in Australia for almost a decade. Since its release, "Kylie" has sold seven million copies worldwide. 

Minogue did experience minor success with the album in [[North America]], due mainly to the success of her re-recording "[[The Loco-Motion]]" for the album. The song reached number three on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100]] singles chart, but the album did not fare as well, only reaching number fifty-three on the [[Billboard Top 200]] albums chart. Despite its low chart peak, "Kylie" achieved gold certification in the US. 

In late 1988, the album was repackaged and re-released in Australia as the "Kylie Collection", a collection of album tracks and remixes. A [[VHS]] was also released and included [[music videos]] for all of the six singles that had been released from the album.

==Chart performance==
"Kylie" was an international success. The album was the highest selling album in the UK for 1988 and was also the fifth biggest selling album of the 1980s in the UK. Internationally it spent five weeks at number two in Australia and charted within the Top 10 of multiple album charts including [[Germany]], [[Finland]], [[France]], and [[New Zealand]]. The album also enjoyed minor chart success in the US, peaking at number 53 on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart.

Even though, the album was certified 6x Platinum (1.8 Million) in the United Kingdom, it has been published that its actual sales to date are 2.1 Million<ref>[http://www.ukmix.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=38032&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=25 UK Sales for "Kylie"]</ref>

:: For more information on the single releases please see their respective pages.

'''Six singles''' were released from the album:

"[[I Should Be So Lucky]]" was Minogue's first international release. Already well known to the British public due to the [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'', it reached number one on the [[United Kingdom|UK]] charts. The song became Minogue's second Australian number one. It also broke into the US charts, peaking at number 28 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] singles chart.

"[[Got To Be Certain]]" was released in May 1988. It reached number one in [[Australia]] and number two in the UK, giving Minogue her third Australian number one in a row. It also became only the second single ever to debut at number one in Australia.

"[[The Loco-Motion (Kylie Minogue song)|Locomotion]]" was originally released in [[Australia]] in July 1987 – before Kylie had signed to [[PWL]] – and it stayed at number one for 7 weeks, becoming the highest selling single in Australia of both 1987 and the entire 1980s. This version of the song does not appear on ''Kylie'', but it was re-recorded with Stock Aitken & Waterman, who believed the sound of the Australian original would not be popular in the UK.  A remix of the re-recorded version (which had been renamed slightly as "[[The Loco-Motion]]") was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in August 1988 and reached number two. The track is Minogue's most successful single in the [[United States]], where it reached number three.  Prior to the release of ''Fever'' in 2001, "The Loco-Motion" was the song she was best remembered for in [[United States|America]].

"[[Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi]]" was released in October 1988. It became her third consecutive number two hit in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The song was not released in [[Japan]], where "[[Turn It Into Love]]" was released instead. 

"Turn It Into Love" was the fourth single release from the album in Japan and reached the top spot on the international singles chart. 

"It's No Secret" received a [[United States|U.S.]] release only and reached number 37 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. The single was within weeks of being released in Australia and New Zealand – 7" and 12" vinyl singles had been pressed and cover sleeves printed – when it was pulled at the last minute in Australia, so as not to impact on the imminent release of Kylie's duet with Jason Donovan, "Especially For You".  In New Zealand however it charted at #47.
