'''Multiple Sclerosis''' (abbreviated '''MS''', also known as '''disseminated sclerosis''' or '''encephalomyelitis disseminata''') is a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Inflammation|inflammatory]], [[demyelinating disease]] that affects the [[Central Nervous System|central nervous system (CNS)]]. MS can cause a variety of [[symptom]]s, including changes in [[sensation]], [[Visual perception|visual]] problems, muscle weakness, [[depression (mood)|depression]], difficulties with coordination and speech, severe fatigue, cognitive impairment, problems with balance, overheating, and [[pain and nociception|pain]]. MS will cause impaired mobility and [[disability]] in more severe cases.

Multiple sclerosis affects [[neuron]]s, the cells of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] that carry information, create thought and perception, and allow the brain to control the body. Surrounding and protecting some of these neurons is a fatty layer known as the [[myelin]] sheath, which helps neurons carry [[electricity|electrical]] [[Signal (biology)|signal]]s. MS causes gradual destruction of myelin ([[demyelination]]) and transection of neuron [[axons]] in patches throughout the brain and spinal cord. The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to the multiple scars (or scleroses) on the myelin sheaths. This scarring causes symptoms which vary widely depending upon which signals are interrupted. 

The predominant theory today is that MS results from attacks by an individual's [[immune system]] on the [[nervous system]] and it is therefore usually categorized as an [[autoimmune diseases|autoimmune disease]]. There is a minority view that MS is not an autoimmune disease, but rather a metabolically dependent neurodegenerative disease. Although much is known about how MS causes damage, its exact cause remains unknown.

Multiple sclerosis may take several different forms, with new symptoms occurring either in discrete attacks or slowly accruing over time. Between attacks, symptoms may resolve completely, but permanent neurologic problems often persist, especially as the disease advances. MS currently does not have a cure, though several treatments are available that may slow the appearance of new symptoms. 

MS primarily affects adults, with an age of onset typically between 20 and 40 years, and is more common in women than in men.<ref>Dangond, F.''Multiple sclerosis.'' eMedicine Neurology.

== Signs and symptoms ==      
{{Main|Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms}}

MS can cause a variety of symptoms, including changes in sensation ([[hypoesthesia]]), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance ([[ataxia]]); problems in speech ([[dysarthria]]) or swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), visual problems ([[nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]], or [[diplopia]]), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and acute or chronic [[pain and nociception|pain]] syndromes, [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[bowel]] difficulties, [[cognitive]] impairment, or emotional symptomatology (mainly [[depression]]).

The initial attacks are often transient, mild (or asymptomatic), and self-limited. They often do not prompt a health care visit and sometimes are only identified in retrospect once the diagnosis has been made based on further attacks. The most common initial symptoms reported are: changes in [[sensation]] in the arms, legs or face (33%), complete or partial vision loss ([[optic neuritis]]) (16%), weakness (13%), [[diplopia|double vision]] (7%), unsteadiness when walking (5%), and balance problems (3%); but many rare initial symptoms have been reported such as [[aphasia]] or [[psychosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Navarro S, Mondéjar-Marín B, Pedrosa-Guerrero A, Pérez-Molina I, Garrido-Robres J, Alvarez-Tejerina A |title=[Aphasia and parietal syndrome as the presenting symptoms of a demyelinating disease with pseudotumoral lesions] |journal=Rev Neurol |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=601-3 |year= |pmid=16288423}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jongen P |title=Psychiatric onset of multiple sclerosis |journal=J Neurol Sci |volume=245 |issue=1–2 |pages=59–62 |year=2006 |pmid=16631798}}</ref> Fifteen percent of individuals have multiple symptoms when they first seek medical attention.<ref>Paty D, Studney D, Redekop K, Lublin F. ''MS COSTAR: a computerized patient record adapted for clinical research purposes.'' Ann Neurol 1994;36 Suppl:S134-5. PMID 8017875</ref> For some people the initial MS attack is preceded by [[infection]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or strenuous physical effort.

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Monthly multiple sclerosis MRI.gif|right|thumb|400px|T1-weighted [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans (post-contrast) of same brain slice at monthly intervals. Bright spots indicate active lesions.]]

Multiple sclerosis is difficult to [[diagnose]] in its early stages. In fact, definite diagnosis of MS cannot be made until there is evidence of at least two [[anatomy|anatomically]] separate demyelinating events occurring at least thirty days apart. 

Historically different criteria were used. The [[Schumacher criteria]] and [[Poser criteria]] were both popular. Currently, [[McDonald criteria]] represents international efforts to standardize the diagnosis of MS using clinical data, laboratory data, and radiologic data.<ref>McDonald WI; Compston A; Edan G; Goodkin D; Hartung HP; Lublin FD; McFarland HF; Paty DW; Polman CH; Reingold SC; Sandberg-Wollheim M; Sibley W; Thompson A; van den Noort S; Weinshenker BY; Wolinsky JS. ''Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the International Panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.'' Ann Neurol 2001 Jul;50(1):121-7 PMID 11456302</ref> 

* Clinical data alone may be sufficient for a diagnosis of MS.  If an individual has suffered two separate episodes of neurologic symptoms characteristic of MS, and the individual also has consistent abnormalities on [[physical examination]], a diagnosis of MS can be made with no further testing. Since some people with MS seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing may hasten the diagnosis and allow earlier initiation of therapy. 
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the brain and spine is often used to evaluate individuals with suspected MS. MRI shows areas of demyelination as bright [[lesion]]s on T2-weighted images or FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) sequences.  [[Gadolinium]] [[contrast]] is used to demonstrate active plaques on T1-weighted images.  Because MRI can reveal lesions which occurred previously but produced no clinical symptoms, it can provide the evidence of chronicity needed for a definite diagnosis of MS. 
* Testing of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) can provide evidence of chronic [[inflammation]] of the central nervous system.  The CSF is tested for [[oligoclonal band]]s, which are [[immunoglobulin]]s found in 85% to 95% of people with definite MS (but also found in people with other diseases).<ref>Rudick, RA, Whitaker, JN. ''Cerebrospinal fluid tests for multiple sclerosis.'' In Scheinberg, P (Ed). Neurology/neurosurgery update series, Vol. 7, CPEC. Princeton, NJ 1987</ref> Combined with MRI and clinical data, the presence of oligoclonal bands can help make a definite diagnosis of MS. [[Lumbar puncture]] is the procedure used to collect a sample of CSF.
* The brain of a person with MS often responds less actively to stimulation of the [[optic nerve]] and [[sensory neuron|sensory nerves]]. These brain responses can be examined using [[visual evoked potential]]s (VEPs) and [[Sensory evoked potentials|somatosensory evoked potentials]] (SEPs). Decreased activity on either test can reveal demyelination which may be otherwise asymptomatic.  Along with other data, these exams can help find the widespread nerve involvement required for a definite diagnosis of MS.<ref>Gronseth GS; Ashman EJ. ''Practice parameter: the usefulness of evoked potentials in identifying clinically silent lesions in patients with suspected multiple sclerosis (an evidence-based review): Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.'' Neurology 2000 May 9;54(9):1720–5. PMID 10802774</ref>

Another test which may become important in the future is measurement of [[antibody|antibodies]] against myelin [[protein]]s such as [[myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein]] (MOG) and [[myelin basic protein]] (MBP). [[As of 2007]], however, there is no established role for these tests in diagnosing MS.

The signs and symptoms of MS can be similar to other medical problems, such as  [[Devic's disease|neuromyelitis optica]], [[stroke]], [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis|brain inflammation]], [[infection]]s such as [[Lyme disease]] (which can produce identical MRI lesions and CSF abnormalities<ref>Garcia-Monco JC; Miro Jornet J; Fernandez Villar B; Benach JL; Guerrero Espejo A; Berciano JA.

[[tumor]]s, and other autoimmune problems, such as [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]]. Additional testing may be needed to help distinguish MS from these other problems.

== Disease course and clinical subtypes ==
[[Image:Types of MS-2.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Graph representing the different types of multiple sclerosis]]
The course of MS is difficult to predict, and the disease may at times either lie dormant or progress steadily. Several subtypes, or patterns of progression, have been described. Subtypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to [[predict]] the future course. Subtypes are important not only for [[prognosis]] but also for therapeutic decisions. In 1996 the [[United States]] [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]] standardized the following four subtype definitions:<ref>Lublin FD; Reingold SC. ''Defining the clinical course of multiple sclerosis: results of an international survey. National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA) Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of New Agents in Multiple Sclerosis.'' Neurology 1996 Apr;46(4):907-11. PMID 8780061</ref>

;Relapsing-remitting
:Relapsing-remitting describes the initial course of 85% to 90% of individuals with MS. This subtype is characterized by unpredictable attacks ([[relapse]]s) followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet ([[remission (medicine)|remission]]) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits suffered during the attacks may either resolve or may be permanent. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is referred to as "[[benign]]" MS.
;Secondary progressive
:Secondary progressive describes around 80% of those with initial relapsing-remitting MS, who then begin to have neurologic decline between their acute attacks without any definite periods of remission. This decline may include new neurologic symptoms, worsening [[neurocognitive|cognitive]] function, or other deficits.  Secondary progressive is the most common type of MS and causes the greatest amount of [[disability]].
;Primary progressive
:Primary progressive describes the approximately 10% of individuals who never have remission after their initial MS symptoms. Decline occurs continuously without clear attacks. The primary progressive subtype tends to affect people who are older at disease onset.
;Progressive relapsing
:Progressive relapsing describes those individuals who, from the onset of their MS, have a steady neurologic decline but also suffer superimposed attacks; and is the least common of all subtypes

Special cases of the disease with non-standard behavior have also been described although many researchers believe they are different diseases. These cases are sometimes referred to as [[borderline forms of multiple sclerosis]] and are [[Devic's disease|Neuromyelitis optica]] (NMO), [[Balo concentric sclerosis]], [[Schilder disease|Schilder's diffuse sclerosis]] and [[Marburg multiple sclerosis]]<ref>Borderline forms of MS, Fontaine, B., Federation de Neurologie, INSERM U546, Groupe Hospitalier, Faculte de Medecine Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=11787357&query_hl=15&itool=pubmed_docsum]</ref>.

== Factors triggering a relapse ==
Multiple sclerosis relapses are often unpredictable and can occur without warning with no obvious inciting factors. Some attacks, however, are preceded by common triggers. In general, relapses occur more frequently during spring and summer than during autumn and winter. Infections, such as the [[common cold]], [[influenza]], and [[gastroenteritis]], increase the risk for a relapse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Confavreux C |title=Infections and the risk of relapse in multiple sclerosis |journal=Brain |volume=125 |issue=Pt 5 |pages=933-4 |year=2002 |pmid=11960883 |doi=}}</ref> 
[[Stress (medicine)|Emotional]] and physical stress may also trigger an attack,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buljevac D, Hop WC, Reedeker W, ''et al'' |title=Self reported stressful life events and exacerbations in multiple sclerosis: prospective study |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7416 |pages=646 |year=2003 |pmid=14500435 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7416.646}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown RF, Tennant CC, Sharrock M, Hodgkinson S, Dunn SM, Pollard JD |title=Relationship between stress and relapse in multiple sclerosis: Part I. Important features |journal=Mult. Scler. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=453-64 |year=2006 |pmid=16900759 |doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown RF, Tennant CC, Sharrock M, Hodgkinson S, Dunn SM, Pollard JD |title=Relationship between stress and relapse in multiple sclerosis: Part II. Direct and indirect relationships |journal=Mult. Scler. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=465-75 |year=2006 |pmid=16900760 |doi=}}</ref> as can severe illness of any kind.  
Statistically, there is no good evidence that either [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or [[surgery]] trigger relapses. People with MS can participate in [[sport]]s, but they should probably avoid extremely strenuous exertion, such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon running]].  Heat can transiently increase symptoms, which is known as [[Uhthoff's phenomenon]]. This is why some people with MS avoid [[sauna]]s or even hot showers. 
However, heat is not an established trigger of relapses.<ref> {{cite journal |author=Tataru N, Vidal C, Decavel P, Berger E, Rumbach L |title=Limited impact of the summer heat wave in France (2003) on hospital admissions and relapses for multiple sclerosis |journal=Neuroepidemiology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=28-32 |year=2006 |pmid=16804331 |doi=10.1159/000094233}}</ref>

[[Pregnancy]] can directly affect the susceptibility for relapse. The last three months of pregnancy offer a natural protection against relapses. However, during the first few months after delivery, the risk for a relapse is increased 20%&ndash;40%. Pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Children born to mothers with MS are not at increased risk for [[congenital disorder|birth defect]]s or other problems.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Worthington J, Jones R, Crawford M, Forti A |title=Pregnancy and multiple sclerosis--a 3-year prospective study |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=241 |issue=4 |pages=228-33 |year=1994 |pmid=8195822 |doi=}}</ref>

Many potential triggers have been examined and found not to influence relapse rates in MS. Influenza [[vaccination]] is safe, does not trigger relapses, and can therefore be recommended for people with MS. There is also no [[evidence]] that [[hepatitis B]], [[varicella]], [[tetanus]], or [[Bacille Calmette-Guerin]] (BCG - immunization for [[tuberculosis]]) increases the risk for relapse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Confavreux C, Suissa S, Saddier P, Bourdès V, Vukusic S |title=Vaccinations and the risk of relapse in multiple sclerosis.

== Pathophysiology ==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis}}
Although much is known about how multiple sclerosis causes damage, the reasons why multiple sclerosis occurs are not known.

Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the [[myelin]] (a [[lipid|fatty]] substance which covers the [[axon]]s of [[neuron|nerve cells]]) degenerates. According to the view of most researchers, a special subset of [[lymphocyte]]s, called [[T cell]]s, plays a key role in the development of MS.

According to a strictly immunological explanation of MS, the inflammatory processes triggered by the T cells create leaks in the [[blood-brain barrier]] (a capilar system that should prevent entrance of T-cells in the nervous system). These leaks, in turn, cause a number of other damaging effects such as [[edema|swelling]], activation of [[macrophages]], and more activation of cytokines and other destructive [[protein]]s such as [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s. A deficiency of [[uric acid]] has been implicated in this process<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rentzos M, Nikolaou C, Anagnostouli M, Rombos A, Tsakanikas K, Economou M, Dimitrakopoulos A, Karouli M, Vassilopoulos D |title=Serum uric acid and multiple sclerosis |journal=Clinical neurology and neurosurgery |volume=108 |issue=6 |pages=527-31 |year=2006 |pmid=16202511}}</ref>.

In a person with MS, these [[lymphocyte]]s recognize myelin as foreign and attack it as if it were an invading virus. That triggers [[inflammation|inflammatory]] processes, stimulating other immune cells and soluble factors like [[cytokine]]s and [[antibody|antibodies]].

It is known that a repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the [[oligodendrocyte]]s that originally formed a [[myelin sheath]] cannot completely rebuild a destroyed myelin sheath. The newly-formed myelin sheaths are thinner and often not as effective as the original ones. Repeated attacks lead to successively fewer effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons, according to [[pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis#Demyelination patterns|four different damage patterns]]<ref>Lucchinetti, C. Bruck, W. Parisi, J. Scherhauer, B. Rodriguez, M. Lassmann, H.''Heterogeneity of multiple sclerosis lesions: implications for the pathogenesis of demyelination'' Ann Neurol, 2000; 47(6):707-17. PMID 10852536</ref>. The central nervous system should be able to recruit oligodendrocyte [[stem cell]]s capable to turn into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, but it is suspected that something inhibits stem cells in affected areas.

Also the neuron axons are damaged by the attacks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pascual AM, Martínez-Bisbal MC, Boscá I, ''et al'' |title=Axonal loss is progressive and partly dissociated from lesion load in early multiple sclerosis |journal=Neurology |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=63-7 |year=2007 |pmid=17606882 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000265054.08610.12}}</ref>. Often, the brain is able to compensate for some of this damage, due to an ability called [[neuroplasticity]]. MS symptoms develop as the cumulative result of multiple [[lesion]]s in the brain and [[spinal cord]]. This is why symptoms can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where their lesions occur.

== Causes ==
Although many risk factors for multiple sclerosis have been identified, no definitive cause has been found. MS likely occurs as a result of some combination of both [[ecosystem|environmental]] and [[genetics|genetic]] factors. Various theories try to combine the known data into plausible explanations. Although most accept an [[autoimmune]] explanation, several theories suggest that MS is an appropriate immune response to an underlying condition. The need for alternative theories is supported by the poor results of present therapies, since autoimmune theory predicted greater success.<ref>

Neurol. |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=688; author reply 688-9 |year=2005 |pmid=15824275}}</ref>

===Environmental===
The most popular hypothesis is that a [[virus|viral]] infection or [[retrovirus|retroviral]] reactivation primes a susceptible immune system for an abnormal reaction later in life. On a [[molecule|molecular]] level, this might occur if there is a structural similarity between the infectious virus and some component of the central nervous system, leading to eventual confusion in the [[immune system]].  

Since MS seems to be more common in people who live farther from the equator, another theory proposes that decreased sunlight exposure<ref>{{cite journal |author=van der Mei IA, Ponsonby AL, Dwyer T, ''et al'' |title=Past exposure to sun, skin phenotype, and risk of multiple sclerosis: case-control study |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7410 |pages=316 |year=2003 |pmid=12907484 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7410.316}}</ref> and possibly decreased [[vitamin D]] production may help cause MS.  This theory is bolstered by recent research into the [[biochemistry]] of vitamin D, which has shown that it is an important immune system regulator.  A large, 2006 study by the Harvard School of Public Health, reported evidence of a link between Vitamin D deficiency and the onset of multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Munger KL, Levin LI, Hollis BW, Howard NS, Ascherio A |title=Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and risk of multiple sclerosis |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=23 |pages=2832-8 |year=2006 |pmid=17179460 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.23.2832}}</ref>

Other theories, noting that MS is less common in children with siblings, suggest that less exposure to illness in childhood leads to an immune system which is not primed to fight infection and is thus more likely to attack the body. One explanation for this would be an imbalance between the Th1 type of [[T helper cell|helper T-cells]], which fight infection, and the Th2 type, which are more active in [[allergy]] and more likely to attack the body. 

Other theories describe MS as an immune response to a chronic infection. The association of MS with the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] suggests a potential viral contribution in at least some individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levin LI, Munger KL, Rubertone MV, ''et al'' |title=Temporal relationship between elevation of epstein-barr virus antibody titers and initial onset of neurological symptoms in multiple sclerosis |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=20 |pages=2496-500 |year=2005 |pmid=15914750 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.20.2496}}</ref>  Still others believe that MS may sometimes result from a chronic infection with [[spirochetal]] bacteria, a hypothesis supported by research in which cystic forms were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of all MS patients in a small study.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brorson O, Brorson SH, Henriksen TH, Skogen PR, Schøyen R |title=Association between multiple sclerosis and cystic structures in cerebrospinal fluid |journal=Infection |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=315-9 |year=2001 |pmid=11787831 |doi=}}</ref> When the cysts were cultured, propagating spirochetes emerged.  Another bacterium that has been implicated in MS is ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]''; it or its DNA has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients by several research laboratories, with one study finding that the [[oligoclonal bands]] of 14 of the 17 MS patients studied consisted largely of antibodies to Chlamydophila antigens.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yao SY, Stratton CW, Mitchell WM, Sriram S |title=CSF oligoclonal bands in MS include antibodies against Chlamydophila antigens |journal=Neurology |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=1168-76 |year=2001 |pmid=11342681 |doi=}}</ref>

Severe stress may also be a factor &mdash; a large study in Denmark found that parents who had lost a child unexpectedly were 50% more likely to develop MS than parents who had not.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Li J, Johansen C, Bronnum-Hansen H, Stenager E, Koch-Henriksen N, Olsen J | title = The risk of multiple sclerosis in bereaved parents: A nationwide cohort study in Denmark. | journal = Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 5 | pages = 726-9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15007121}}</ref> [[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]] has also been shown to be an independent risk factor for developing MS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Franklin GM, Nelson L |title=Environmental risk factors in multiple sclerosis: causes, triggers, and patient autonomy |journal=Neurology |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=1032-4 |year=2003 |pmid=14581658 |doi=}}</ref>

===Genetic===
MS is not considered a [[hereditary]] disease. However, increasing scientific evidence suggests that genetics may play a role in determining a person's susceptibility to MS: 

Some populations, such as the [[Roma people|Roma]], [[Inuit]], and [[Bantu]]s, rarely if ever get MS. The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and [[Asian]]s have very low incidence rates. 

In the population at large, the chance of developing MS is less than a tenth of one percent. However, if one person in a family has MS, that person's first-degree relatives—parents, children, and siblings—have a one to three percent chance of getting the disease.

For identical [[twins]], the likelihood that the second twin may develop MS if the first twin does is about 30%; for fraternal twins (who do not inherit identical gene pools), the likelihood is closer to that for non-twin siblings, or about 4%. The fact that the rate for identical twins both developing MS is significantly less than 100% suggests that the disease is not entirely genetically controlled. Some (but definitely not all) of this effect may be due to shared exposure to something in the environment, or to the fact that some people with MS lesions remain essentially asymptomatic throughout their lives.

Further indications that more than one gene is involved in MS susceptibility comes from studies of families in which more than one member has MS. Several research teams found that people with MS inherit certain regions on individual genes more frequently than people without MS. Of particular interest is the [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) or [[major histocompatibility complex]] region on chromosome 6. HLAs are genetically determined proteins that influence the immune system. However, there are other genes in this region which are not related to the immune system.

The HLA patterns of MS patients tend to be different from those of people without the disease. Investigations in northern Europe and America have detected three HLAs that are more prevalent in people with MS than in the general population. Studies of American MS patients have shown that people with MS also tend to exhibit these HLAs in combination—that is, they have more than one of the three HLAs—more frequently than the rest of the population. Furthermore, there is evidence that different combinations of the HLAs may correspond to variations in disease severity and progression.

Studies of families with multiple cases of MS and research comparing proteins expressed in humans with MS to those of mice with EAE suggest that another area related to MS susceptibility may be located on chromosome 5. Other regions on chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 11, 17, 19, and X have also been identified as possibly containing genes involved in the development of MS.

These studies strengthen the theory that MS is the result of a number of factors rather than a single gene or other agent. Development of MS is likely to be influenced by the interactions of a number of genes, each of which (individually) has only a modest effect. Additional studies are needed to specifically pinpoint which genes are involved, determine their function, and learn how each gene's interactions with other genes and with the environment make an individual susceptible to MS.

== Approved treatments ==
:Only approved treatments here. For experimental therapies and medication for symptoms see [[therapies for multiple sclerosis]].

There is no known definitive cure for multiple sclerosis. However, several types of therapy have proven to be helpful. Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS attacks. Treatment is aimed at returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability.

Various disease-modifying treatments have been approved by the USA's [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA); as well as in other countries; for multiple sclerosis. More treatments are being studied and undergoing the approval process.

This drug stimulates [[T cells]] in the body's immune system to change from harmful, pro-inflammatory agents to beneficial, anti-inflammatory agents that work to reduce inflammation at [[lesion]] sites. 

*'''[[mitoxantrone|MITOXANTRONE]]''': (trade name ''Novantrone'')
:This medication is effective, but is limited by [[cardiac]] [[toxicity]]. Novantrone has been approved by the USA's FDA for secondary progressive, progressive-relapsing, and worsening relapsing-remitting MS.
 
*'''[[natalizumab|NATALIZUMAB]]''': (trade name ''Tysabri''). 
:This medication is effective and safe alone but in combination with other immunotherapies can lead to [[Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy|PML]].


Relapsing-remitting symptomatic attacks can be treated. Patients are typically given high doses of [[intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]], to end the attack sooner and leave fewer lasting deficits. Patients' self-reporting indicates that many find benefit from a number of other medicines.

Currently there are no approved treatments for primary progressive multiple sclerosis, though several medications are being studied.

Pain relief medications and treatments for symptoms; as well as treatments under investigation are described at [[Therapies for multiple sclerosis]].



== Prognosis ==
The [[prognosis]] (the expected future course of the disease) for a person with multiple sclerosis depends on the subtype of the disease; the individual's sex, race, age, and initial symptoms; and the degree of disability the person experiences. The [[life expectancy]] of people with MS is now nearly the same as that of unaffected people.  This is due mainly to improved methods of limiting disability, such as [[physical therapy]], [[Occupational Therapy]] and [[speech therapy]], along with more successful treatment of common complications of disability, such as [[pneumonia]] and [[urinary tract infection]]s.<ref>Weinshenker BG. ''Natural history of multiple sclerosis.'' Ann Neurol 1994;36 Suppl:S6–11. PMID 8017890</ref> Nevertheless half of the deaths in people with MS are directly related to the consequences of the disease, while 15% more are due to suicide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stern M |title=Aging with multiple sclerosis |journal=Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=219-34 |year=2005 |pmid=15561552}}</ref> 

*Individuals with progressive subtypes of MS, particularly the primary progressive subtype, have a more rapid decline in function. In the primary progressive subtype, supportive equipment (such as a [[wheelchair]] or [[standing frame]]) is often needed after six to seven years. However, when the initial disease course is the relapsing-remitting subtype, the average time until such equipment is needed is twenty years. This means that many individuals with MS will never need a wheelchair. There is also more cognitive impairment in the progressive forms than in the relapsing-remitting course.
*The earlier in life MS occurs, the slower [[disability]] progresses. Individuals who are older than fifty when diagnosed are more likely to experience a chronic progressive course, with more rapid progression of disability. Those diagnosed before age 35 have the best prognosis. Females generally have a better prognosis than males. Although individuals of African descent tend to develop MS less frequently, they are often older at the time of onset and may have a worse prognosis. 
*Initial MS symptoms of visual loss or sensory problems, such as [[numbness]] or [[tingling]], are markers for a relatively good [[prognosis]], whereas [[gait disturbance|difficulty walking]] and [[weakness (medical)|weakness]] are markers for a relatively poor prognosis. Better outcomes are also associated with the presence of only a single symptom at onset, the rapid development of initial symptoms, and the rapid regression of initial symptoms. 
*The degree of disability varies among individuals with MS.  In general, one of three individuals will still be able to work after 15&ndash;20 years.  Fifteen percent of people diagnosed with MS never have a second relapse, and these people have minimal or no disability after ten years.<ref>Pittock SJ; McClelland RL; Mayr WT; Jorgensen NW; Weinshenker BG; Noseworthy J; Rodriguez M. ''Clinical implications of benign multiple sclerosis: a 20-year population-based follow-up study'' Ann Neurol 2004 Aug;56(2):303-6. PMID 15293286</ref> The degree of disability after five years correlates well with the degree of disability after fifteen years.  This means that two-thirds of people with MS with low disability after five years will not get much worse during the next ten years. It should be noted that most of these outcomes were observed before the use of medications such as interferon, which can delay disease progression for several years. 

Currently there are no clinically established [[laboratory investigation]]s available that can predict prognosis or response to treatment.  However, several promising approaches have been proposed. These include measurement of the two [[antibody|antibodies]] [[myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein|anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein]] and [[myelin basic protein|anti-myelin basic protein]], and measurement of TRAIL ([[TNF]]-related [[apoptosis]]-inducing [[ligand]]).<ref>Berger T, Rubner P, Schautzer F, Egg R, Ulmer H, Mayringer I, Dilitz E, Deisenhammer F, Reindl M. ''Antimyelin antibodies as a predictor of clinically definite multiple sclerosis after a first demyelinating event.'' N Engl J Med. 2003 Jul 10;349(2):139-45. PMID 12853586</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
[[Image:MS Risk.jpg|thumb|450px|right|World map showing that risk for MS increases with greater distance from the equator]]
In northern [[Europe]], continental [[North America]], and [[Australasia]], about one of every 1000 citizens suffers from multiple sclerosis, whereas in the [[Arabian peninsula]], [[Asia]], and continental [[South America]], the frequency is much lower. In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], MS is extremely rare. With important exceptions, there is a north-to-south gradient in the northern hemisphere and a south-to-north gradient in the southern hemisphere, with MS being much less common in people living near the equator.<ref>[http://www.fedem.org/revista/n16/kurtzkeing.htm Epidemiology and multiple sclerosis. a personal review]</ref> [[Climate]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[geomagnetism]], [[toxin]]s, [[sunlight]] exposure, genetic factors, and [[infectious disease]]s have all been discussed as possible reasons for these regional differences. Environmental factors during childhood may play an important role in the development of MS later in life. This idea is based on several studies of migrants showing that if [[migration]] occurs before the age of fifteen, the migrant acquires the new region's susceptibility to MS. If migration takes place after age fifteen, the migrant keeps the susceptibility of his home country.<ref>Marrie, RA. ''Environmental risk factors in multiple sclerosis aetiology.'' Lancet Neurol. 2004 Dec;3(12):709-18. Review. PMID 15556803</ref>

MS occurs mainly in [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]. It is twentyfold lower in the [[Inuit]] people of [[Canada]] than in other Canadians living in the same region. It is also rare in the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of [[North America]], [[Australian Aborigine]]s and the [[Māori]] of [[New Zealand]].  [[Scotland]] appears to have the highest rate of MS in the world <ref> {{cite journal |author=Rothwell PM, Charlton D |title=High incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis in south east Scotland: evidence of a genetic predisposition |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=730-5 |year=1998 |pmid=9647300 |doi=}}</ref>.  The reasons for this are unknnown. These few examples point out that either genetic background or lifestyle and cultural factors play an important role in the development of MS. 

As observed in many autoimmune disorders, MS is more common in females than males; the mean sex [[ratio]] is about two females for every male. In children (who rarely develop MS) the sex ratio may reach three females for each male.  In people over age fifty, MS affects males and females equally. Onset of symptoms usually occurs between fifteen to forty years of age, rarely before age fifteen or after age sixty.

As previously discussed, there is a genetic component to MS. On average one of every 25 siblings of individuals with MS will also develop MS. Almost half of the [[identical twin]]s of MS-affected individuals will develop MS, but only one of twenty fraternal twins. If one parent is affected by MS, each child has a risk of only about one in forty of developing MS later in life.<ref>Sadovnick, AD, Ebers, GC, Dyment, DA, Risch, NJ. ''Evidence for genetic basis of multiple sclerosis. The Canadian Collaborative Study Group.'' Lancet 1996; 347:1728. PMID 8656905</ref>

Finally, it is important to remark that advances in the study of related diseases have shown that some cases formerly considered MS are not MS at all. In fact, all the studies before 2004 can be affected by the impossibility to distinguish MS and [[Devic's disease|''Devic's disease'' (NMO)]] reliably before this date. The error can be important in some areas, and is considered to be 30% in Japan.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weinshenker B |title=Western vs optic-spinal MS: two diseases, one treatment? |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=594-5 |year=2005 |pmid=15728277}}</ref>

== History ==
The [[France|French]] [[neurologist]] [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825&ndash;93) was the first person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct, separate [[disease]] in 1868. Summarizing previous reports and adding his own important clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease ''sclerose en plaques''. The three signs of MS now known as [[Charcot's triad]] are [[dysarthria]] (problems with speech), [[ataxia]] (problems with coordination), and [[tremor]]. Charcot also observed cognition changes in MS since he described his patients as having a "marked enfeeblement of the memory" and "with conceptions that formed slowly".<ref>Charcot, J. ''Histologie de la sclerose en plaques.'' Gazette des hopitaux, Paris, 1868; 41: 554–555.</ref>   

Prior to Charcot, Robert Hooper (1773&ndash;1835), a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] pathologist and practicing [[physician]], Robert Carswell (1793&ndash;1857), a British professor of [[pathology]], and [[Jean Cruveilhier]] (1791&ndash;1873), a French professor of pathologic [[anatomy]], had described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details.

After this, several people, such as [[Eugène Devic]] (1858–1930), [[Jozsef Balo]] (1895–1979), [[Paul Ferdinand Schilder]] (1886–1940), and [[Otto Marburg]] (1874–1948) found special cases of the disease that some authors consider different diseases and now are called the [[borderline forms of multiple sclerosis]].

There are several historical accounts of people who probably had MS. [[Saint Lidwina]] of [[Schiedam]] (1380&ndash;1433), a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[nun]], may be one of the first identifiable MS patients. From the age of sixteen until her death at age 53, she suffered intermittent pain, weakness of the legs, and vision loss&mdash;symptoms typical of MS. Almost a hundred years before there is a story from [[Iceland]] of a young woman called Halla. This girl suddenly lost her vision and capacity to talk; but after praying to the saints recovered them seven days after.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poser C |title=The dissemination of multiple sclerosis: a Viking saga? A historical essay |journal=Ann. Neurol. |volume=36 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=S231-43 |year=1994 |pmid=7998792}}</ref>  [[Augustus d'Este|Augustus Frederick d'Este]] (1794&ndash;1848), an illegitimate grandson of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]], almost certainly suffered from MS. D'Este left a detailed diary describing his 22 years living with the disease. He began his diary in 1822 and it had its last entry in 1846 (only to remain unknown until 1948). His symptoms began at age 28 with a sudden transient visual loss after the funeral of a friend. During the course of his disease he developed weakness of the legs, clumsiness of the hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder disturbances, and [[erectile dysfunction]]. In 1844, he began to use a [[wheelchair]]. Despite his illness, he kept an optimistic view of life.<ref>{{cite book |last= Firth|first=D |title= The Case of August D`Esté|year=1948 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}</ref> Another early account of MS was kept by the British diarist [[W. N. P. Barbellion]], who maintained a detailed log of his diagnosis and struggle with MS. His diary was published in 1919 as ''The Journal of a Disappointed Man''.

==Cultural references==
The German [[propaganda film]] ''[[Ich klage an]]'' (1941) by [[Wolfgang Liebeneiner]] had the main character suffering from MS and wishing herself to be killed because she had become unable to do so by herself. In ''[[Duet for One]]'', [[Julie Andrews]] plays a concert violinist who must sacrifice her career when she is diagnosed with MS. 

In the American television series ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', the fictional United States President, [[Josiah Bartlet|Josiah "Jed" Bartlet]], has the relapsing-remitting subtype of MS. The storylines have educated many viewers about the nature of MS and have helped to dispel some of the misconceptions about the disease. 
Another American TV series, ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'', aired a two-part episode on [[February 12]], [[2006]] that featured a new home for [[Carol Crawford-Smith]] of [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], a former principal dancer with the [[Dance Theatre of Harlem]] who was diagnosed with MS in 2000. [[Ty Pennington]] and his team not only built her a new home, but also renovated her Blacksburg dance studio, "The Center of Dance."

In the 2006 film [[Dreamland]] the character Callista suffers from Multiple Sclerosis.
[[England|British]] [[cello|cellist]] [[Jacqueline du Pré]] died with MS in 1987 when she was 42. After a long struggle with the disease, she was robbed of her capacity to perform as she progressively lost sensitivity in her fingers, hearing, and muscle coordination.  This decline was portrayed in the 1998 film, ''[[Hilary and Jackie]]''.  The above-mentioned play ''Duet for One'' was inspired by du Pre's life.

Actor [[Vidya Balan]] played an MS patient in a [[Bollywood]] movie ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]''. The character suffers with impaired legs and extreme weakness.  The film portrays the problems that people having MS face in their daily lives.
