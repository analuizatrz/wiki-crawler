The '''2003 Atlantic hurricane season''' was an active [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic]] [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]] with [[tropical cyclone|tropical activity]] before and after the official bounds of the season – the first such occurrence in 50&nbsp;years. The season produced 21&nbsp;[[tropical cyclone]]s, of which 16&nbsp;developed into named storms; seven cyclones attained hurricane status, of which three reached [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane status]]. With sixteen storms, the season was tied for the sixth most active [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane season]] on record. The strongest hurricane of the season was [[Hurricane Isabel]], which reached [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] northeast of the [[Lesser Antilles]]; Isabel later struck [[North Carolina]] as a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane, causing $3.6&nbsp;billion in damage (2003&nbsp;[[USD]], $4.04&nbsp;billion 2007&nbsp;USD) and a total of 51&nbsp;deaths across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

The season began with [[Tropical Storm Ana (2003)|Subtropical Storm Ana]] on [[April 20]], prior to the official start of the season; the bounds of the season are from [[June 1]] to [[November 30]], which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. In early September, [[Hurricane Fabian]] struck [[Bermuda]] as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] hurricane, where it was the worst hurricane since [[1926 Atlantic hurricane season|1926]]; on the island it caused four deaths and $300&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $336&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD). [[Hurricane Juan]] caused considerable destruction to [[Nova Scotia]], particularly [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], as a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane, the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since [[1893 Atlantic hurricane season|1893]]. Additionally, Hurricanes [[Hurricane Claudette (2003)|Claudette]] and [[Hurricane Erika (2003)|Erika]] struck [[Texas]] and [[Tamaulipas]], respectively, as minimal hurricanes.

===Pre-season outlook===
On [[May 19]], prior to the start of the season, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] forecasters issued a 55%&nbsp;probability of above normal activity. The forecasters predicted 11&ndash;15 tropical storms, 6&ndash;9 of those becoming hurricanes, and 2&ndash;4 of those hurricanes reaching at least Category&nbsp;3 strength on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. The above normal activity predicted was due to the likelihood of [[La Niña]] developing in the season.<ref name="NOAA May">{{

Starting in the season, the [[National Hurricane Center]] began issuing five-day forecasts, extending from the three-day forecasts issued since 1964.

{{anchor|Tropical Storm Bill}}By the end of June, the third tropical depression of the season developed near the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]; it tracked northward, strengthening into [[Tropical Storm Bill (2003)|Tropical Storm Bill]] before striking the southern [[Louisiana]] coast on [[June 30]]. The storm caused moderate rainfall and a tornado outbreak across the southern United States, resulting in four deaths and $30&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $35&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref name="billtcr">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Bill Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-10-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003bill.shtml?}}</ref>

Its intensity fluctuated while crossing the basin, attaining hurricane status before weakening and striking the Yucatán Peninsula as a tropical storm. Claudette re-intensified to hurricane status and struck southeastern [[Texas]] on [[July 15]], causing a total of three deaths, one of which directly, and $180&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $200&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref name="claudettetcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=Hurricane Claudette Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003claudette.shtml}}</ref>

Tracking west-northwestward around the [[subtropical ridge]], it encountered favorable conditions, and steadily intensified to reach peak winds of 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 1]]. Fabian turned to the north and gradually weakened, passing just west of Bermuda on [[September 5]] as a [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]]. On [[September 8]], it became an [[extratropical cyclone]] after causing four deaths and $300&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $336&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) in damage on Bermuda; there, it was considered the worst hurricane in nearly 80&nbsp;years.

After fluctuating in intensity for the subsequent four days, it weakened and struck [[North Carolina]] as a Category&nbsp;2&nbsp;hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.
