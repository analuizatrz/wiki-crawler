== History ==
'''Boy''' was founded in [[Los Angeles]] in 1981, by ex-members of [[The Nu Kats]], [[The Motions]], [[The Scooters]], and [[Snapshots]]. 

[[Freddy Moore]] of [[The Nu Kats]], [[Sharkey McEwen|Mark McEwen]] of [[The Motions]] and [[Dave Srb]] of [[Snapshots]] were the founding members. They recruited [[Bobby Wickland]] of [[The Scooters]] and [[Bobbyzio Moore]] of [[The Nu Kats]] and began rehearsing. 

[[Bobby Wickland]] received a call inviting him to join [[Badfinger]] and was quickly replaced by [[John Nyman]]. A few months later [[Dave Srb]] was replaced by Nu Kat [[Dennis Peterson|Dennis Peters]]. The line up was set. Although the Boy Horns ([[Patrick Boone]] and [[Norm Cowan]]) were soon added.
 
Boy recorded and released 'Next Door' on [[Radioactive Records]] in 1983 and contributed several new songs to various film soundtracks.
