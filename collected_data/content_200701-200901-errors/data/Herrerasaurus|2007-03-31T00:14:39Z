'''''Herrerasaurus''''' was one of the earliest [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]]s. It lived in what is now [[Argentina]], during the Late [[Triassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] ([[Carnian]] stage).

''Herrerasaurus'' was named after Victorio Herrera, the farmer who first noticed its fossils in outcrops near San Juan in 1959, although a complete skull was not found until 1988. The book ''The Dinosaur Hunters'', by David Spalding, identifies Victorino (not Victorio) Herrera as a goatherd and states that Osvaldo Reig was the [[paleontologist]] who suggested the name.  It has been brought into wider notice by [[Paul Sereno]].

It is estimated that ''Herrerasaurus'' could reach up to 15 feet (5 meters) in length. It was a [[biped]]al [[carnivore]], which most likely fed on small and medium-sized animals. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, which means that it was most likely a swift runner. ''Herrerasaurus'' was one of the first dinosaurs and was one of the first animals to embody the distinctive 'carnivorous dinosaur' ([[theropod]]-like) shape, but there is still discussion as to whether they were [[basal]] theropods, basal [[saurischian]]s or evolved prior to the saurischian-[[ornithischian]] split. 

Although ''Herrerasaurus'' shared the body shape of the large carnivorous dinosaurs, it lived at a time when dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of reptiles, not dinosaurs and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. By the end of the [[Triassic]] Period, dinosaurs would rule the planet and the mammal-like reptiles would be nearly gone. At the same time, some of the first mammals began to evolve. 

''Herrerasaurus'' lived alongside another early dinosaur (about 230 [[million years ago]]), ''[[Eoraptor]]'', as well as ''[[Saurosuchus]]'', a giant land-living [[crocodylian]], in the jungles of Late Triassic [[South America]]. Originally found in the [[Patagonia]] region of [[Argentina]], one specimen can be found in the [[Chicago]] [[Field Museum of Natural History]].

This dinosaur is an enigmatic creature, showing traits that are found in different groups of dinosaurs. It is also similar to much later [[Jurassic]] dinosaurs. Some fossils indicate that ''Herrerasaurus'' could grow up to 3 meters in length and 1 meter in height.
