"'''Weather with You'''" is a 1991 song by rock group [[Crowded House]]. It was the third and most successful single released from the group's third studio album ''[[Woodface]]'', reaching top fifty charts in six countries with a peak of #7 in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Bailey, Marck; [http://www.etext.org/lists/house/ch-discography.html Comprehensive discography] of Crowded House including track listings for all albums and singles. Released [[28 March]], [[1995]]. Retrieved [[4 July]], [[2007]].</ref>

In 1996, Crowded House disbanded, releasing a greatest hits album ''[[Recurring Dream]]'' in June of that year. "Weather with You" was made the album's first track. Later in the year, the band reunited for one final performance at the [[Sydney Opera House]] and performed the song again, calling upon ex-member [[Tim Finn]], who originally performed the song with the group, to join the group onstage. This live performance was not included on the VHS release of the concert, but it was shown on television broadcast and also appeared on the 10 year anniversary DVD entitled ''[[Farewell to the World]]''.

In 2002, [[reggae]] group [[Aswad]], covered the song for their album ''[[Cool Summer Reggae]]'' and then in 2006, [[Jimmy Buffett]] covered "Weather with You" and used it as the namesake for his album ''[[Take the Weather with You]]''.

==Music video==
The music video for "Weather with You" was filmed after [[Tim Finn]]'s departure, despite his being an important part of the song's creation. The video features the remaining members, [[Neil Finn]], [[Paul Hester]] and [[Nick Seymour]], in various scenarios including at a marketplace, in a convertible car on vacation and on the beach. Though the song is about the effect a person has on their surroundings by the type of person they are, whether it be good or bad, the video clip shows the band enjoying themselves, like many other Crowded House music videos.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIb6I8gtgtw Weather with You].
