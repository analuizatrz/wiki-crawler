'''Tzaraath''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] צרעת, and numerous variants of [[English language|English]] [[transliteration]], including ''tzaraas'', ''tzaraat'', ''tsaraas'' and ''tsaraat'')  is a disfigurative condition referred to in chapters 13-14 of [[Leviticus]].  ''"Tzaraath'' affects both animate as well as inanimate objects; the [[Torah]] discusses ''tzaraath'' that afflicts humans, clothing and houses.  As there are not terms synonymous with ''tzaraath'' in other languages, the [[Septuagint]] gave a translation of ''lepra'', and was consequently mistranslated by older [[English translations of the Bible]] as ''[[leprosy]]'', with which ''lepra'' is [[cognate]].  Although this misconception has been perpetuated by the continuous mistranslation of the word ''tzaraath'', the notion that ''tzarrath'' shares any relationship with [[leprosy]] is "completely erroneous."<ref>[[Artscroll]] [[Tanach]], [[Leviticus]] 13, commentary. page 272.</ref>

The [[root word|linguistic root]] of ''tzaraath'' means "smiting", in reference to a Talmudical explanation that it serves as a punishment for [[sin]]<ref>Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref>; it is quite possible that ''tzaraath'' was a general term for certain types of skin disease, rather than a particular condition<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>, and the [[Talmud]] maintains a similar view, arguing that ''tzaraath'' referred generally to any disease that produces sores and eruptions on the skin.<ref>Sifra 60a</ref>.

==Torah sources==
The [[Torah]] identifies three manifestations of ''tzaraath'': as an affliction of human skin,<ref>Leviticus 13:2</ref> of garments<ref>Leviticus 13:47</ref> and of houses.<ref>Leviticus 14:34</ref>

The Torah also speaks of tzaraath on two other occasions, one in reference to [[Moses]] and the other in reference to his sister, [[Miriam]].  In [[Exodus]] 4:6-7, when Moses is standing before the [[burning bush]], he doubts that the sages who lead [[Children of Israel|Israel]] will believe that he is the messenger of God.  God provides him with two signs to prove his mission: turning his rod into a snake and then back into a rod and turning his hand into being striken with ''tzaraath'' and then back again.  Moses revealed these wonders to the sages in Exodus 4:30.

In [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 12:10, Miriam was striken with ''tzaraath'' for her involvement in slandering Moses.  [[Aaron]] asks Moses to cure her via extraordinary means, because he claims that he, as her own brother, cannot examine, confine or purify her.<ref>[[Rashi]] to [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 5:12 -- Although, as indicated in the Mishna (''Nega'im'' 2:5) we do not rule by the authority who disqualifies a kohen from examining relatives.</ref>  Moses prays for his sister and she is cured of the tzaraat but must remain in confinement for seven days.  The Torah, however, does not indicate that she went through any purification process similar to what is normally required, as elaborated on below.

===Affliction of human skin===
Leviticus 13:2 introduces ''tzarrath'':

:"אדם כי יהיה בעור בשרו שאת או ספחת או בהרת לנגע צרעת והובא אל אהרן הכהן או אל אחד מבניו הכהנים"
:"If a person will have on the skin of his flesh a ''s'eit'' or a ''sapachat'' or a ''baheret'' and it will become a ''tzaraath'' affliction on the skin of his flesh; he shall be brought to [[Aaron]] the ''[[kohen]]'' or to one of his sons the ''kohanim''."

The three subdivisions of skin ''tzaraath'' are best left transliterated, rather than translated, because there are no equivalent English terms and any attempt to translate them would greatly diminish the distinctiveness and focus of the [[Hebrew]] term.  Additionally, a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' is not to be performed by anyone but a ''kohen'' (member of the priestly caste).

The manifestation of ''tzaraath'' is termed a נגע (''negah'', "skin eruption" or literally "a strike," plural: נגעים, ''nega'im'') and there are three varieties of ''nega'im'' that relate to human flesh:<ref>[[Misha]] ''Nega'im'', [[English language|English]] translation by [[Pinchas Kehati]], Maor Wallach Press, Israel, Introduction to the tractate, page 1.</ref>
#patches of the skin <ref>Leviticus 13:2-17</ref>
#boils and burns <ref>Leviticus 13:18-28</ref>
#bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, the ''negah'' of which is called a נתק (''nesek'') <ref>Leviticus 13:29-44</ref>

====Patches of the skin====
Patches of the skin are confirmed as ''tzaraath'' by the occurrence of one of three signs:<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 3:3</ref>
#white hair (והיא הפחה שאר לבן) - if at least two hairs within the confines of the ''negah'' turn white <ref>Leviticus 13:10</ref>
#healthy flesh (ומחית בשר חי) - if skin of a normal appearance appears within the confines of the patch <ref>Leviticus 13:10</ref>
#spreading (ואם פשה תפשה המספחת בעור) - if the patch became enlarged since the time of the initial examination by the Kohen <ref>Leviticus 13:7</ref>

Whereas baldness is not a form of ''tzaraath'', patches that occur on a bald scalp may be ''tzaraath'' if they meed the criteria as mentioned by the [[Torah]].  Such an eruption on a bald scalp must appear in a distinct fashion but is regulated by rules similar to that of ''nega'im'' on the skin; however, it can only occur on men.  For a scalp eruption to be ''tzaraath'', the lesion must be a white patch tinged with red (נגע לבן אדמדם).<ref>Leviticus 13:42</ref>  This can occur in one of two places: within what are referred to as a man's anterior bladness (קרחת) and posterior baldness (גבחת).

If someone cuts off some skin or a part of his body in order to remove a ''negah'', he becomes impure, even if he had no confiming signs.  He may become pure only after another ''negah'' forms.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 7:5</ref>  The exception is when a ''negah'' appears on the tip of the [[foreskin]] and is cut off during [[circumcision]], which is permitted, because a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 7:5</ref>

====Boils and burns====
Boils and burns, as occur naturally as a result of an [[abscess]], blunt force trauma or thermal insult to the skin, are not ''tzaraath'' and do not carry impurity.  During the healing phases of these wounds, however, if certain signs that mimic those of the aforementioned patches appear, ''tzaraat'' may occur.  Confirmation is by the occurrence of one of two signs:<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 3:4</ref>
#white hair (ושארה הפך לבן and נהפך שאר לבן בבהרת) - similar to that in patches <ref>Leviticus 13:20 and 13:25</ref>
#spreading (ואם פשה תפשה בעור and אם פשה תפשה בעור) - similar to that in patches <ref>Leviticus 13:22 and 13:27</ref>

====Bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard====
The initial symptom of this type of ''negah'' is patches of hair loss.  According to [[Maimonidies]], scalp and beard ''nega'im'' are characterized by hair loss without any change to the skin of the blad spot.<ref>[[Maimonidies]], [[Mishnah Torah]], ''Taharah'', ''Hilchot Tuma'at Tzaraat'' 8:1</ref>  The [[Tosefta]], however, maintains that the skin of the bald spot does indeed become altered in a ''negah''.  There are two confirming signs:<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 3:5</ref>
#thin yellow hair (ובו שאר צהב דק) - if at least two hairs from within the bald patch turn yellow <ref>Leviticus 13:30</ref>
#spreading (והנה פשה הנתק בעור) - if the balding spreads <ref>This, according to Maimonidies.  According to [[Abraham ben David|Raavad]], who quotes the Tosefta, this spreading would refer to spreading of a skin change as well.</ref><ref>Leviticus 13:36</ref>

====Inspection of ''nega'im'' of human flesh and ''tzaraath'' determination====
For all of the different types of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, there is a similar protocol put in place by the [[Torah]] for determining whether or not the skin eruption is indeed ''tzaraath''.  The individual with the eruption must visit a ''[[kohen]]'', who is a male possessing direct lineage to [[Aaron]], who was the [[kohen gadol|kohen gadol (High Priest)]] and brother of [[Moses]].  The ''kohen'', trained in examining lesions and diagnosing ''tzaraath'', will examine the lesion and determine whether or not it meets the specifications of ''tzaraath''.  Specifically, he will evaluate the lesion for the criteria mentioned above, except of course for the final criterion of spreading, which can only be diagnosed at a follow-up examination, should on be necessary.  If during the initial examination, the characteristics of the lesion meet the criteria for ''tzaraath'', the ''kohen'' will declare the individual ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (טמא, "ritually impure").<ref>Leviticus 13:3, 20, 25, 30</ref>

If the criteria are not met by the lesion during the initial examination by the ''kohen'', the individual is confined in his home for seven days, pending a follow-up examination.<ref>Leviticus 13:4, 21, 26, 31</ref>  If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' are again not met and the lesion has not spread, there is a difference in protocol depending of the type of lesion.
*For patches of the skin, another confinement period of seven days is imposed.<ref>Leviticus 13:5, </ref>
*For boils or burns, the kohen declares it merely a צרבת (''tzarevet'', "scar") and there are no further examinations.<ref>Leviticus 13:23 and 28</ref>
*For bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, another confinement period of seven days is imposed.  However, prior to this second confinement period, the individual is shaved around the ''nesek'' (והתגלח ואת הנתק לא יגלח - "he should be shaved but the ''nesek'' should not be shaved), leaving a rim of two hairs completely surrounding the bald spot in order to make any spreading recognizable<ref>Leviticus 13:33 + associated commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> (especially according to Maimonidies, who asserts that these lesions manifest as pure hair loss without any concomitant skin eruption.)

After the second confinement period of seven days, both those with patches on the skin as well as those with bald patches are re-evaluated once more.<ref>Leviticus 13:6 and 34</ref>  If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have still not been met, the afflicted individual is declared ''tahor'' (טהר, "ritually pure").<ref>Leviticus 13:6 and 34</ref>  He or she, does, however, have to wash both his or her body and garments;<ref>Leviticus 13:6 and 34</ref> due to the confinement, he or she is considered impure in some sense.<ref>Leviticus 13:6, commentary by Rashi</ref>

If the ''negah'' was declared ritually pure and later it spread, it must be shown once again to a ''kohen'', who will then declare it ''tzaraath''.<ref>Leviticus 13:7-8 and 35-36</ref>
There are many other regulations regarding the inspection:
*The ''kohen'' must be able to see the entirety of the lesion.  Thus, if the skin eruption or bald spot wraps around either the body or bady parts, or occurs at the tip of terminal body parts -- anyplace that would preclude the observation of the entire lesion at one time (i.e. wrapping around the torso, scalp or arm, or occurring at the tip of a finger or toe), there can be no declaration of ''tzaraath''.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 6:7</ref>
*In a similar vein, a ''kohen'' who is blind in one eye or who cannot see well may not perform the inspections.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 2:3</ref>  An eligible ''kohen'' may inspect anyone, including his relatives, except himself.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 2:5</ref>  However, it is not necessary that a ''kohen'' perform the inspection; anyone who is proficient in the laws of ''nega'im'' may perform the examination.  However, only a ''kohen'' may declare purity or impurity.  A non-''kohen'' examiner may inform an accompanying inexpert ''kohen'' of his determination that a ''negah'' is or is not ''tzaraath'' and the ''kohen'' declares "purity" or "impurity".<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 3:1</ref>
*''Nega'im'' do not render impurity on parts of the body that are naturally concealed by other parts of the body according to specific regulations.  For skin eruptions on the legs, men are inspected standing as though they are hoeing and women standing as though they are rolling dough.  For eruptions on the arms, men raise their arms as though they are picking olives and women raising their arms as though they are weaving or spinning.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 2:4</ref>
*''Nega'im'' do not render [[gentile]]s impure.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 3:1</ref>
*A groom is exempt from visiting the kohen until the eight day after his wedding for any ''nega'im'' on his flesh, garments or house.  Similarly, there are no insepctions carried out on the days of [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] or [[Sukkot]].<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 3:2</ref>
*Even on the days when inspections are performed, they are only allowed for two hours each day: during the fourth and eighth hour of the day (corresponding roughtly to 9-10 AM and 2-3 PM).<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 2:2</ref>
 
If, however, the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have been met, either during the initial exam or at either of the two follow-ups (when applicable) or even after a previous declaration of purity, the individual is declared ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (טמא, "ritually impure").  The individual is declared impure even if the lesion did not worsen or spread but remained the same -- the skin eruption must become dimmer in appearance for it to be declared pure at the second follow-up examination.<ref>Leviticus 13:6 + commentary of Rashi</ref>

====The ''metzorah'': managment of ''tzaraath'' of human flesh====
The individual who is declared impure with ''tzaraath'' is referred to as a either<ref>Leviticus 13:44 and 14:2, respectively</ref> a ''tzorua'' (צרוע) or a ''metzorah'' (מצרה).  The ''metzorah'' is shunned and must live alone outside the confines of the community.<ref>Leviticus 13:46</ref>  The ''metzorah'' tears his or her garments in mourning like those who are in [[sitting shiva|mourning]] for a close family member and does not cut his or her hair.   The ''metzorah'' must also cover his or her face until the upper lip in the fashion of mourners, and he or she calls out "impure, impure" to warn others to keep their distance.<ref>Leviticus 3:45 + commentary of Rashi</ref>

The ''metzorah'' remains confined outside of the community until his ''tzaraath'' vanishes -- the ''metzorah'' is evaluated by a ''kohen'' who leaves the community in order to examine him or her.  When the ''kohen'' observes the resolution of the ''tzaraath'', he begins a procedure that will ultimately result in the reversal of the impure status of the ''metzorah'':<ref>Leviticus 14:4</ref>

:"וצוה הכהן ולקח למטהר שתי צפרים חיות טהורות ועץ ארז ושני תולעת ואזב"
:"The ''kohen'' shall command to take for the person undergoing purification (the ''metzorah'') two live [[kosher]] birds, cederwood, red string and [[hyssop]]."

The items used in the purification ritual were specifically included to deliver a message to the ''metzorah''.  Although many sins may lead to this punishment, the most predominant sin to cause ''tzaraath'' is [[lashon hara]], loosely translated as "gossip."  The ''metzorah'', who talked derogatorily about others consistently to his friends is likened to birds, who chatter endlessly.<ref>Talmud ''Arachin'' 16b</ref>  In a similar vein, the one who speaks ill of others is haughty, holding himself or herself high above others and is likened to the tall [[ceder]].  In order to be healed, the ''metzorah'' must erase his or her arrogance, making himself or herself lowly like a worm<ref>This is a play on words -- the word תולעת (tola'as) means both "red" and "worm."</ref> or a hyssop.

Spring water is placed in an earthenware vessel, over which one of the birds is slaughtered and into which the blood is allowed to run.  The ''kohen'' then dips the remaining bird and other items into the bloodied water and sprinkles the ''metzorah'' seven times on the back of the hand.<ref>Some say the sprinking was done onto his or her forehead.</ref>  The identical procedure would be performed for a house struck by ''tzaraath'', with the sprinkling done on the [[lintel]].<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 14:1</ref>  The slaughtered bird was buried in the presence of the ''metzorah'' and the live bird was freed into the open field.

The ''metzorah'' washes the garments he or she had been wearing from impurity and shaves off all of his or her hair, save for that which is located in places similar to those in which ''nega'im'' are not subject to impurity.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 2:4</ref>  The ''metzorah'' then waits for seven days to begin the final steps of his or her purification ceremony.<ref>Leviticus 14:8-9</ref>  On the seventh day, the ''metzorah'' again washes the garments he or she had been wearing from impurity and again shaves off all of his or her hair.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 14:3</ref>  On the eighth day, the ''metzorah'' brings three animal sacrifices to the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]]: a sin offering of a female [[lamb]] and a guilt offering and a burnt offering, both of male lambs.<ref>Leviticus 14:10</ref>

Blood from the slaughtered guilt offering was placed on the right ear, right thumb and right big toe of the ''metzorah''.<ref>Leviticus 14:14</ref>  The need for this to be done was cause for some complication, because the ''metzorah'' was not allowed into Temple grounds prior to his purification process and the blood of the offering was not allowed out of the Temple grounds.  To reconcile this dilemma, the ''metzorah'' would stick these body parts through the gateway one at a time to receive the blood.  The same was done with the oil from the flour offerings of the ''metzorah''.  If the ''metzorah'' lost any of these body parts after he was ready for purification, he could never obtain purification.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 14:9</ref> 

===Affliction of clothing===
''Tzaraath'' can also afflict garments.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 13:47</ref>  Garment ''tzaraath'' is relevant to only three materials:
#[[wool]] (צמר)
#[[linen]] (פשתים)
#Two types of [[leather]] are indicated in the [[Torah]]<ref>Leviticus 13:48</ref>
##untanned leather (עור)
##tanned leather (כל מלאכת עור, literally "all worked leather")

In a woolen or linen garment, the ''tzaraath'' may appear as a uniformly existing ''negah'' within the material or as a ''negah'' limited to either only the [[weft|woof]] or [[warp (weaving)|warp]] (או בשתי או בערב) of the garment.<ref>Leviticus 13:48</ref>

There are a number of limitations to ''tzaraath'' as it applies to clothing:
*Clothing belonging to a [[gentile]] are insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.
*Only sheep's wool is susceptible to a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'', although an even mixture of sheep's wool and another type of wool (camel's wool, for example) can be afflicted.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 11:2</ref>  In a similar vein, a mixture of plant fibers containing linen is insusceptible unless it is at least half linen.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 11:2</ref>
*The leather referring to by the Torah does not include the hides of marine animals.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 11:1</ref>
*The fabric of wool or linen or leather article cannot be rendered impure by ''tzaraath'' is if it artificially dyed.  If, however, the item is naturally colored (such as wool from a black sheep), it can be rendered impure.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 11:3</ref>

====Appearance, inspection and management of ''tzaraath'' in clothing====
''Tzaraath'' appears in clothing as an intense green (ירקרק - ''yerakrak'') or red (אדמדם - ''adamdam'') eruption,<ref>Leviticus 13:49</ref> and must be brought to the ''[[kohen]]''  for inspection.  In regards to garment ''tzaraath'', there are no criteria by which it can be declared impure upon initial examination.  The garment is confined for seven days, and if on the seventh day, the ''negah'' has spread, it is a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'' and is declared impure.<ref>Leviticus 13:51</ref>  Subsequent to a declaration of ''tzaraath'', the garment, whether or wool, linen or leather, is completely burnt (באש תשרף); if the ''tzaraath'' was confined to the woof or warp, only that need be burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:52</ref>

If upon re-evaluation after the seven day confinement, the ''kohen'' instructs that the garment with the eruption be washed and confined once more for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 13:54</ref>  If upon a second re-evaluation after the second seven days of confinement, the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption did not dim and did not spread, the garment is declared impure and must be completely burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:55</ref>

If the second re-evaluation reveals a dimming of the eruption, the ''kohen'' tears the area with the eruption from the garment and burns the torn out portion completely.<ref>Leviticus 13:56, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>  The torn out area is patched to allow for a reinspection of the area for return of the ''negah''.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 11:5</ref>  If, the eruption returns to the patch, there is no confinement period instituted and the entire garment is completely burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:57, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>; if a ''negah'' reappears on the garment but not on the patch, the garment must be burned but the patch can be saved.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 11:6</ref>  To recapitulate, if the ''negah'' remained as it was after the first week of confinement, it is washed and reconfined.  If it remained as it was after the second week of confinement, it is burned.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 11:5</ref>

If, however, upon the second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' disappears, the garment must be immersed in a ''[[mikvah]]'' (מקוה, "ritual bath") and is then pure.<ref>Leviticus 13:58, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>

===Affliction of housing===
The third and last type of ''tzaraath'' mentioned by the [[Torah]] affects buildings.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 14:34</ref>  If an individual notices an affliction on his house, he is to inform a ''[[kohen]]''.  The ''kohen'' will then command that they empty the house of all of its contents prior to his inspection; this is to prevent further financial loss, because should the house be confined, everything within it would become impure as well.<ref>Leviticus 14:36</ref>

When the ''kohen'' comes to perform the inspection, he looks for lesions on the wall that appear either intense green (ירקרקת) or intense red (אדמדמת) and that appear sunken below the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the wall's surface (שפל מן הקיר, literally "lower than the wall").  If this is what he sees, the ''kohen'' exits the house and confines it for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 14:38</ref>

On the seventh day, upon re-evaluating the eurption, if the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption has spread beyond what it had been, the afflicted stones are removed, the area around the afflicted stones is scraped and both the removed stones and clay plaster are cast into a place of impurity.<ref>Leviticus 14:40-1</ref>  At least two afflicted stones are necessary for removal of any stones and at least two new stones must be used to fill the void.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 12:6</ref>  If the afflicted wall is shared by two houses owned by two neighbors, both neighbors must help to remove the afflicted stones, scrape and place the new stones, but only the owner of the house whose interior was afflicted performs the replastering.  It is from this ruling that the [[proverb]] ''Oy l'rasha, oy l'scheino'' (או לרשע או לשכנו, "Woe to the wicked! Woe to his neighbor!) originates.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 12:6</ref>

The void is filled with new stones and clay plaster and the house is confined for another seven days.  If upon a second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' has returned after new stones have been plastered in, the ''negah'' is deemed ''tzaraath'' and the entire house must be dismantled.<ref>Leviticus 14:36</ref>  If the ''negah'' does not return, the house is pronounced pure, and the same purification process mentioned in relation to ''tzaraath'' of human flesh is employed here.

There are numerous limitations put on the ''tzaraath'' that afflicts houses:
*The house of a [[gentile]] is insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.
*Only houses that possess four walls and four corners are susceptible.  similarly, only those houses that rest on the ground are susceptible, to the exclusion of those that are suspended above ground or which are built on a boat.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 12:1</ref>
*''Tzaraath'' only affects houses that are built entirely out of stones, wood and clay plaster.  If any of the four walls are built or internally overlaid with [[marble]], natural outcropping of rock, [[brick]] or earthen soil, that wall is insusceptible to ''tzaraath'', and a house cannot be rendered impure unless all four walls are susceptible.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 12:2</ref>
*Two storey houses are treated as two distinct houses and the beams that serve as the floor of the upper storey and the roof of the lower storey are allowed to remain with whichever house remains.<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 13:3</ref>
*Houses are the only buildings that are susceptible to ''tzaraath'' (not, for example, barns or cattle stalls) and only houses that exist within the region of land originally divided among the 12 tribes, because the verse refers to ''beis eretz achuzaschem'' (בית ארץ אחזתכם, "a house of the land of your inheritance"); this also excludes houses in [[Jerusalem]], because it was not given as an inheritance to any one tribe, but rather held jointly by all of [[Children of Israel|Israel]].<ref>Mishna ''Nega'im'' 12:5, commentary of [[Pinchas Kehati]]</ref>

===Interpretations===
[[Samson Raphael Hirsch|Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch]] demonstrated at length that ''tzaraath'' was not to be interpreted as a medical malady, but rather as a spiritual affliciton.  The verse itself indicates this, as it directs those who find themselves afflicted to seek out a Kohen (priest) and not a doctor, while the Torah specifically permits and even encourages those who are in need of medical care to seek treatment from physicians.<ref>[[Exodus]] 21:19</ref>

The Torah's emphasis is clearly on the ''tu'mah'' (טומאה, "ritual impurity ") that results from a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' because the verses focus on the ''kohen'''s declaration of "unclean" - וראהו הכהן וטמא אתו ("The ''kohen'' will see [the eruption] and [declare] him impure").

The Talmud, and the majority of historic Jewish literature in general, regards ''tzaraath'' as a [[punishment]] for [[sin]]; it lists seven possible causes for ''tzaraath''<ref>[[Talmud]] Arachin 16a</ref>:
* an ''[[lashon hara|evil tongue]]'' (malicious [[gossip]])
* [[murder]]
* a vain [[oath]]
* illicit [[sexual intercourse]]
* [[pride]]
* [[theft]]
* [[miser]]ly behaviour

One ''[[midrash]]ic'' source categorically states that ''tzaraath'' only appeared as punishment for ''evil tongue'', while others add further reasons to the list in the Talmud. Unlike the modern medical approach, which seeks to cure by natural means, the classical Jewish sources argue that cure from ''tzaraath'' only came about through [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]] and forgiveness. In particular, the [[Rabbah|Midrash Rabbah]] sees the different types of ''tzaraath'' as increasing levels of punishment, which could be curtailed at any stage if repentance was made:
#the first stage in the Rabbah's view was the infection of homes, and if repentance came here it would only require the removal of the affected stones for a cure.
#in the second stage, the entire house must be torn down as the ''tzaraath'' would not go away, and the infection came upon one's clothes; if repentance came here it required only washing of the clothes for a cure.
#in the third stage of Rabbah's scheme, the clothes must be burnt, and the infection enters the person's skin; if repentance occurs here then purification could occur.
#in the fourth stage, which only occurs when the person has completely refused to repent, the person is forced to dwell alone.

Other [[classical rabbinical literature|classical rabbinical writers]] saw ''tzaraath'' of houses as having a practical benefit. According to one, as well as being a punishment for miserlyness, it also demonstrated that the house owner was lying, if they had said they did not own certain objects which neighbours had asked to borrow, since the biblical regulations require the house owner to take all their possessions outside prior to confinement<ref>Leviticus 14:36</ref>. On the other hand, [[Rashi]], basing his view on the [[Leviticus Rabbah]]<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'' 17:6</ref>, states that ''tzaraath'' of houses was a reward for the homeowner, arguing that the [[Israelite]] homes had previously been those of [[Canaanites]], who had hidden their valuables in the walls; the ''tzaraath'' would require the house owner to remove the bricks, and so find the treasures hidden there<ref>Leviticus 14:34, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>.

Rather than following the biblical descriptions of the symptoms of ''tzaraath'' in the manner than modern doctors would, [[classical rabbinical literature]] took an extremely literal view<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>. In the group of symptoms where the hair of the inflicted region has turned white, the [[Mishnah]] argues that plucking out the white hair was all that was required for the disease not to be considered ''tzaraath''<ref>Nega'im, 8:4</ref>; similarly since the biblical text mentions ''tzaraath'' occurring where boils had previously healed, but not where unhealed boils exist, the Mishnah maintains that the appearance of the other symptoms in an unhealed boil or burn do not indicate ''tzaraath'', and that if the boil/burn does subsequently heal it still wouldn't indicate ''tzaraath'' unless the other symptoms occur in parts of the body that were not previously diseased<ref>Nega'im, 9:2</ref>. The Mishnah also argues that sores smaller than the size of a [[lentil]], those on the extremities of the body (such as the fingers, toes, ears, nose, breasts, etc.), those which occur in the location of an unhealed boil or burn, and those which occur in hairy parts of the body, do not indicate ''tzaraath''<ref>Nega'im 8:1</ref><ref>Nega'im 6:8</ref>.

Scholars suspect that these descriptions of ''tzaraath'', where it applies to skin conditions, actually refer to a number of different [[dermatology|skin diseases]]<ref>''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''</ref><ref>''Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia''</ref><ref>[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1959/JASA3-59Spinka.html Dr. Harold Spinka, M.D.]</ref>, which, owing to the undeveloped state of medical science at that period, were not distinguished<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>. Of the particular situations that the Priestly Code describes as being ''tzaraath'',
*the whitening of the skin over the whole body with sores, is considered by scholars to be most indicative of Psoriasis <ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Shai A, Vardy D, Zvulunov A |title=[Psoriasis, biblical afflictions and patients' dignity] |language=Hebrew |journal=Harefuah |volume=141 |issue=5 |pages=479–82, 496 |year=2002 |pmid=12073533 |doi=}}</ref><ref>Cheyne and Black, ''Encyclopedia Biblica''</ref>
*the spreading of sores is regarded by scholars as most symptomatic of [[Impetigo]]<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>
*the spreading of swellings or spots in a burn injury, according to scholars, is most probably a result of [[Erysipelas]]<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>
*in regard to subcutaneous disease where the hair has turned white
**the additional presence of swellings or spots in a burn injury are thought by scholars most likely to be [[Cutaneous leishmaniasis|Tropical Sore]]s<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>
**the additional presence of bodily sores, and swellings or spots where there previously had been a boil, is one of the classical symptoms of Leprosy<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>
**the additional presence of sores on the head or chin is thought by scholars to most probably indicate the presence of [[Ringworm]]<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref><ref>Cheyne and Black, ''Encyclopedia Biblica''</ref>

====Symptoms of other conditions====

In addition to simple [[rash]]es<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:4-6|}}</ref>, [[inflammation]]s<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:23|}}</ref>, and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]]s<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:28|}}</ref>, the biblical text mentions a number of other conditions that could be confused with ''tzaraath''. Among the other situations which the text considers harmless are the appearance of dull white spots<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:38-39|}}</ref>, white patches of skin without sores<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:12-13|}}</ref>, and baldness without sores<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:28|}}</ref>; the latter two of these are thought by scholars to most probably refer to [[vitiligo]] and [[alopecia]], respectively<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>, and the bible remarks that the former - the dull white spots - are merely a form of [[freckles]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:39|}}</ref>. The symptoms that the text considers to be indicative of disease include those of the spread of superficial swellings or spots (where there had previously been a boil)<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:21-22|}}</ref>, and those of reddish-white sores in areas of baldness<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:42-44|}}</ref>; the former condition is identified by the bible as ''plague'', and scholars regard its symptoms as pointing to a [[diagnosis]] of [[smallpox]]<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>, while the latter is unidentified in the biblical text, but considered by scholars to indicate [[favus]]<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>.

===In clothing fabrics===
In addition to infecting the skin, ''tzaraath'' is described by the priestly code as being able to infect historically common clothing fabrics, specifically [[wool]], [[linen]], and [[leather]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:47-48|}}</ref>. The Biblical description of ''tzaraath'' in such fabrics is strikingly analogous to that of ''tzaraath'' in the skin<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>, with, for example, spreading of the infection being tested for by isolating the fabric in question for first 7 days<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:50-51|}}</ref>. The principle symptoms are described as being very green or very red spots<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:49|}}</ref>, which spread within a week<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:50-51|}}</ref>, or which don't change appearance at all after a fortnight, having been washed after the first week<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:53-54|}}</ref>, or which return a week after having been torn out, if they also had faded with washing prior to being torn out<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:56-57|}}</ref>. These descriptions are regarded by scholars as most probably indicative of certain [[mould]]s<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref><ref>Cheyne and Black, ''Encyclopedia Biblica''</ref><ref>''Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia''</ref><ref>''Perspectives in Biological Medicine'', [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14593226&dopt=Abstract]</ref>, and especially matching infections by [[Penicillium]] (the [[fungus]] which produces [[penicillin]])<ref>Cheyne and Black, ''Encyclopedia Biblica''</ref>

===In houses===

[[Image:Hausschwamm.jpg|thumb|200px|dry rot]]
The biblical text also describes ''tzaraath'' as infecting the walls of houses<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:34|}}</ref>; the symptoms it describes are depressions in the wall, which are very green or very red<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:37|}}</ref>, and which spread over a period of seven days<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:38-39|}}</ref>. The description is regarded by scholars as again being strikingly similar to the wording of the description of ''tzaraath'' infections in the skin<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>, but still somewhat obscure<ref>Cheyne and Black, ''Encyclopedia Biblica''</ref>; it would seem to fit some form of fungal growth<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>, especially [[dry rot]], which produces yellowish-green and reddish patches on walls<ref>Cheyne and Black, ''Encyclopedia Biblica''</ref>.

==Cause and Treatment==
As a "physical manifestation of a spiritual malaise," ''tzaraath'' is a "divine retribution for the offender's failure to feel the needs and share the hurt of others.<ref>[[Artscroll]] [[Tanach]], [[Leviticus]] 13, commentary. page 272.</ref>

Although the medical and chemical conditions, which scholars consider the descriptions to fit, have obvious [[Pathology|natural causes]] in the light of modern scientific knowledge, the biblical texts characterise it as a spiritual affliction with a supernatural cause, bringing [[ritual impurity]] to its victims. Each victim of ''tzaraas'' mentioned by the Bible is stated to have received the condition due to some transgression of biblical laws<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>, including [[Joab]] being cursed for the murder of [[Abner]], [[Gehazi]] for being covetous, and [[Uzziah]] for infringing the exclusive rights of certain people to burn incense. 

If a person was afflicted with ''tzaraath'' in their skin, they were required to wear torn clothes, keep their hair unkempt, cover the lower part of their face, cry out ''[ritually] impure, [ritually] impure'', and reside away from other people<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:45-46}}</ref>; a few [[Medical history|medical historians]], such as [[Arturo Castiglioni]], regard this as the first model of sanitary legislation<ref>Arturo Castiglioni, ''A history of medicine'' (p. 71)</ref>. Nevertheless, this isolation isn't necessarily due to concerns over the contagiousness of the disease, but rather due to concerns about the risk of moral corruption to other people; the Talmud doesn't treat ''tzaraath'' as contagious<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>, and doesn't consider non-Jewish victims of ''tzaraath'' to be ritually impure<ref>Nega'im 3:1, 11:1</ref>. The Talmud states that if ''tzaraath'' hadn't been confirmed by a [[kohen|Jewish priest]], then a [[bridegroom]] with suspected symptoms of it was allowed to postpone any isolation or inspection by a priest until a week after his [[Jewish wedding|wedding]], and if a person developed suspected symptoms of ''tzaraath'' during a [[Jewish holiday|holy day]], then the isolation and inspection by a priest could be postponed until the holy days had finished<ref>Nega'im 3:2</ref>.

Fabrics and clothing affected by ''tzaraath'' were required by the text to be burnt entirely<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:52|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:55|}}</ref>, unless it was the form of ''tzaraath'' which faded after washing but came back after being torn out, in which case it could be considered ''ritually pure'' as soon as the ''tzaraath'' had gone, and it had subsequently been washed<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:58|}}</ref>. ''Tzaraath'' infections in houses were to be treated similarly harshly according to the biblical regulations, and didn't have any exceptions; stones showing the symptoms had to be removed, and the house had to be scraped, with the removed stones and scraped-off clay being cast into a rubbish heap outside the city<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:40-41|}}</ref>, and if the infection returned once replacement stones were laid and daubed with clay, then the whole house had to be dismantled, with the rubble again going to the tip outside the city<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:42-43|}}</ref>. Additionally, people who had been in a house while it was infected with ''tzaraath'' was considered ritually impure until the evening came, and anyone who had eaten or slept there had to also wash their clothes<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:46-47|}}</ref>
  
===After cure===

When the priest had certified that ''tzaraath'' had been cured, the biblical text requires that the formerly infected person undergo a number of ritual events<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:1-3|}}</ref>, some occurring straight away<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4-8|}}</ref>, and some occurring a week later<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:9-32|}}</ref>. According to critical scholars, these are really two independent rituals spliced together, with the first group<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4-8|}}, as far as ''...ritually pure''</ref> being the ritual that was originally part of the regulations for ''tzaraath'' of skin, and the other group<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8-32|}}, starting at ''After this...'' </ref> being a later attempt at replacing the first group of rituals, so that the regulations fitted better with the sacrifice-centric view of the Aaronid priesthood<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Leviticus''</ref>. The biblical text states that a ritual, almost identical to the first group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath'', also had to be carried out for houses that had been cured of infections from ''tzaraath''<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:49-53|}}</ref>; however, there is no further ritual for houses that could parallel the second group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath''.

The first group of requirements are that the formerly infected person kills a (ritually pure) bird over fresh water, in a clay pot, and dips another living bird, together with cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and [[ezob]], into the blood<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4-6|}}</ref>; this combination was used to sprinkle the formerly infected person seven times with the blood<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7|}}</ref>. Once the surviving bird was released over open fields<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7|}}</ref>, and the formerly infected person had shaved off all their hair, and bathed themselves and their clothes in water, they were counted as ritually pure<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8|}}</ref>. According to biblical scholars, this ritual is primarily an example of [[sympathetic magic]], with the running water and living bird being symbolic representations of ritual impurity going away<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>; killing animals over running water was a widespread ancient custom<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>. The cedar and ezob have more practical applications, with cedarwood having medicinal properties, and ezob being a good implement to use for sprinkling<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>. 

In the second group of requirements, having completed the first group, the formerly infected person is required to avoid their own home for a week (although they may mix with other people)<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8|}}</ref>, after which they must shave off absolutely all of their hair, including their [[eyebrow]]s, and then wash themselves<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:9|}}</ref>. Having done this, the formerly infected individual was required to make a standard [[whole offering]], a standard [[sin offering]] (to excuse the profanity of having had ''tzaraath''<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>), and a [[guilt offering]] (to apologise for the cause of the ''tzaraath''<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>)<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:10-20|}}</ref>; if people are too [[poverty|poor]] to afford that, the bible allows the standard alternative set of sacrificial victims to be used instead<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:21-32|}}</ref>.

Unlike other guilt offerings, the priest was required to put some of the blood from the sacrifice onto the formerly infected person's right ear lobe, right [[thumb]], and right big [[toe]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:14}}</ref>, then some of the oil for the sacrifice had to be poured into the priest's left palm, and applied with the priest's right forefinger onto to the formerly infected person's right ear lobe, right thumb, and right big toe<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:15-17}}</ref>, and then the rest of the oil from the priest's palm was to be poured onto the formerly infected person's head<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:18}}</ref>; critical scholars regard the Priestly Code, of which the ''tzaraath'' regulations are a part, to have been written in the early 7th century<ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''</ref>, and it is in this context that these additional rules have significance. By that era, non-priests were not allowed to pass beyond a certain gateway (the gate of Nicenor) in the complex at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], while the blood from sacrifices couldn't pass outside, thus for a person to be touched by the blood, they had to lean through the gateway without setting foot on the other side; the right ear, thumb, and toe, were symbolically the parts of the body which achieve this<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>.
