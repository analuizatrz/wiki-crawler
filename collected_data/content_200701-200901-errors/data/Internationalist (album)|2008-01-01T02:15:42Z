'''''Internationalist''''' is the third [[studio album]] by [[Australia]]n [[alternative rock]] [[rock band|band]], [[Powderfinger]]. The album was released on [[7 September]] [[1998]] and was often labelled Powderfinger's most adventurous work, with greater [[experimentation]] than in previous works.

''Internationalist'' followed in the success of its predecessor, ''[[Double Allergic]]'', and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|five times platinum]] in Australia. ''Internationalist'' received four [[ARIA Music Awards]], including "Album of the Year". The album produced many singles for the band, including "[[The Day You Come]]", "[[Don't Wanna Be Left Out]]", "[[Good-Day Ray]]", "[[Already Gone (Powderfinger song)|Already Gone]]" and "[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]", which all appeared on [[Triple J]]'s [[Triple J Hottest 100|Hottest 100]] poll in two consecutive years.

''Internationalist'' received fairly positive reviewers in the Australian press, and cemented Powderfinger's position on the local music scene; however, the album failed to launch the band in the overseas market.

== Background ==
Powderfinger spent much of early 1997 [[concert|touring]], after the success of ''[[Double Allergic]]''. [[Songwriter]] [[Bernard Fanning]] then spent much of 1997 writing songs for ''Internationalist'' in [[Brisbane]], drawing on inspiration from a mid-1997 band trip to the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Hot Ticket|publisher=''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''|date=[[2 November]] [[1997]]|author=Fountaine, Angus|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>

The album's title refers to [[escapism]] – namely, the ability that an "[[wikt:internationalist|internationalist]]" has to escape from [[racism|racial]] and [[sociology|social]] tension. When asked in a ''Juice'' interview, [[Bernard Fanning]] summarised the title of the album by stating;
{{cquote|It’s about the idea of all this tension that is around at the moment, all this racial and political tension...The idea is that an ‘internationalist’ has an escape from all that. Music can be a vehicle for that escape.<ref name=TakingFlight />}}

== Recording and production ==
''Internationalist'' was recorded at [[Melbourne]]'s Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by [[United States of America|American]] [[record producer|producer]] [[Nick DiDia]] for the first time. As the band had already prepared "about 30 or 40" songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. [[Bassist]] [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] said of DiDia; "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was that he wanted to record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn’t want to play around too much."<ref name=TakingFlight />  As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was [[Audio mixing|mixed]] by DiDia soon after.<ref name=TakingFlight>{{cite news|title=Taking Flight|publisher=''Juice''|author=Clode, Samantha|date=October 1998|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

Collins described the album as not being as easy listening as their previous work,<ref name=TakingFlight /> and that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting that they had not put into previous albums.<ref name=TakingFlight /> Fanning later said ''Internationalist'' was "a better record" than ''[[Double Allergic]]'', but acknowledged that it was not as easily likeable – it was just an improvement in songwriting.<ref name=Glory /> Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album's experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as [[U2]], who Collins said had "constantly re-invented themselves, and with success".<ref name=TakingFlight /> He said Powderfinger's reinvention was as much for the band's own interest as it was for the "public's perception".<ref name=TakingFlight /> Meanwhile, [[guitarist]] [[Ian Haug]] described the album as a "moderation" between ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]'' ("the complicated beast") and ''Double Allergic'' ("totally simplified"), Powderfinger's two previous albums.<ref name=BeckoningFinger>{{cite news|title=The Beckoning Finger|publisher=''Juice''|author=Watts, Benedict|date=November 1998|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band's "most successful", as well as stating that the album that best replicated "the sound we have live".<ref name=AI>{{cite news|title=Allergic Internationalists|publisher=hEARd online|date=1999|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref>

Numerous songs on ''Internationalist'' were [[politics|politically]] and [[sociology|socially]] influenced, although the band denied it being a deliberate [[Motif (narrative)|motif]].<ref name=TPolitics /> Fanning explaining that the band did not intentionally discuss political issues, saying "we don't try to do anything in particular".<ref name=TPolitics /> He noted, however, that the songs, as his emotional responses to recent events, could inevitably be interpreted as being political.<ref name=TPolitics>{{cite news|title=Talkin' Politics?|publisher=''Beat''|author=Johnson, Neala|date=December 1998|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> When "[[The Day You Come]]" was released, there was speculation that it alluded to [[Pauline Hanson]]'s [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] [[political party]], although the band claimed the song was vague and didn't specifically refer to one person. Fanning said of "The Day You Come";
{{cquote|"I wouldn't certainly say that we've written any protest songs &ndash; "The Day You Come" is the closest to that kind of song, and that typically, like most of our songs can be construed in many ways. And  it was particularly about the way Australian electorate I suppose is moving, and thinking."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/dayoutcome.htm|title=Day You Come (The)|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>}}

''Internationalist'' was released in [[Australia]] on [[7 September]] [[1998]].<ref name=PCDiscog>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/discog/inter.htm|title=Internationalist|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Discography|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> The album is currently certified five times platinum in Australia.<ref name=2007albums>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/httpwww.aria.com.aupagesARIACharts-Accreditations-2007Albums.htm |title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 2007 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref>

The first single from the album was "[[The Day You Come]]", a politically and socially influenced song that mused about [[Pauline Hanson]]'s [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] party. "The Day You Come" was released as the first single (on [[10 August]] [[1998]]) because, according to [[Ian Haug]], the band could not decide on what to release, so they "just came back to it."<ref name=BeckoningFinger /> "The Day You Come" spent nine weeks on the [[ARIA Charts]], peaking at #25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=286146&cat=s|title=Powderfinger - The Day You Come|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref>

The second single was the double [[a-side]], "[[Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray]]", released on [[9 November]] [[1998]]. "Don't Wanna Be Left Out", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, is one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date.<ref name=Feted /> Drummer [[Jon Coghill]] also described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so "fast and offbeat".<ref name=Cogsy>{{cite news|title=Powderfinger (Int. With Jon Coghill)|publisher=Australian Musician Magazine|date=1999|author=Eliezer, Christie|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> "Good-Day Ray" was dedicated to Australian television presenter [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]] and his public disagreements with former ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' host [[Stuart Littlemore]]. The song was described by Coghill as containing "sort of punk lyrics &ndash; not that we're a punk band."<ref name=Feted>{{cite news|title=Fingers feted at home|author=Ritchie Yorke|date=[[15 November]] [[1998]]|publisher=''[[The Sunday Mail]]''|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> Coghill also described the [[music video]] for "Good-Day Ray" as being one of the better videos the band had made.<ref name=Cogsy />

''Internationalist'''s third single was "[[Already Gone (Powderfinger song)|Already Gone]]", released on [[12 February]] [[1999]]. The song was a tribute to [[The Beatles]] and their influence on Powderfinger's music.<ref name=BestOfp10>[[Powderfinger]] (2004). ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000]]'' companion booklet. Page 10.</ref> The fourth and final single from the album was "[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]", released on [[9 August]] [[1999]].  "Passenger" was influenced by [[Elvis Presley]], and included a [[horn (music)|big horn]] section, as well as backing vocals from [[folk music|folk]] group [[Tiddas]].<ref name=P2K>{{cite news|title=Primed for P2K Tour|author=Carmine Pascuzzi|publisher=Media Search|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> "Passenger" won the [[ARIA Awards|ARIA Award]] for "Song Of The Year" in 1999.<ref name=Jackets>{{cite news|title=Trusty Old Jackets|publisher=''Massive''|author=Yates, Rod|date=September 2000|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films.<ref name=P2K /> "Passenger" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=286152&cat=s|title=Powderfinger - Passenger|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref><ref name="fifty">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiftyfifty.tv/cgi-bin/CMS.pl?T=1&P=0|title=www.fiftyfifty.tv|publisher=Fifty Fifty films|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>

== Touring and promotion ==
Powderfinger went on a nationwide tour after the release of ''Internationalist'', performing with [[United Kingdom|British]] band [[Swervedriver]] and fellow Brisbane band [[Not From There]] in capital cities across Australia.<ref name=Fish /><ref name=Feted /> In 1999, the band toured with [[Something for Kate]] and [[Alex Lloyd]].<ref name=Glory>{{cite news|title=Powder And The Glory|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|work=Metro|pages=3|author=Mathieson, Craig|date=[[23 July]] [[1999]]|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> Collins described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating "we had played with most of the bands, and if you're going on tour with someone you may as well go with someone you get along with and whose music you enjoy."<ref name=Fish /> Despite being fans of Swervedriver, who were renowned for "their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting" according to interviewer Neala Johnson,<ref name=TPolitics /> Fanning said Powderfinger would never attempt to replicate them, because he believed live shows to be much more "emotionally powerful" than recordings.<ref name=TPolitics />

With ''Internationalist'', Powderfinger first set their sights overseas, appearing at numerous [[music festival]]s in the U.S., including [[South by Southwest]] in [[Texas]].<ref name=Dream>{{cite news|title=Day Dream Believers|publisher=''Pulse'' liftout. ''[[The Courier-Mail]]''|author=Six, Nicola|date=[[19 November]] [[1998]]|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]]. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult due to the lack of any homegrown fan support.  He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as planned.<ref name=Pulse>{{cite news|title=Finger On The Pulse|publisher=HIT|author=Bolster, Teresa|date=December 1998|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> Coghill, however, described the showcases as "worthwhile" and "fun", as were the performances in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name=P2K /> After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of [[Canada]]. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as "people [in Australia] are going to get sick of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially."<ref name=Dream />

== Reception ==
[[Image:Bernard Fanning 1997.jpg|thumb|left|Fanning received much positive feedback on the politically-driven lyrics of songs in ''Internationalist''.]]
''Internationalist'' debuted at #1 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian albums chart]], and went gold in its first week, selling over 35,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-1998.htm|title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 1998 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> It then went on to go platinum,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-1999.htm|title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 1999 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> and is currently certified five times multi-platinum.<ref name=2007albums /> At the 1999 [[ARIA Awards]], the album received three awards - "Album of the Year", "Best Rock Album", and "Best Cover Art". "The Day You Come" also won "Single of the Year". In 2000, "Passenger" was nominated for three awards, but did not win any.<ref name="arias-list" /><ref name="ARIA-history" />

Haug said he was amazed with the highly positive critical response the album had received, stating "even Molly <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Molly Meldrum|Meldrum]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> gave it nine out of ten. Because every review has been so good it’s a bit dangerous to believe it, I think. It’s just strange to read endless good reviews – I wish someone would write a really bad one."<ref name=BeckoningFinger /> Haug also said that it was important for the band to develop credibility through the album, saying "people will listen with open ears if you’re a credible band. If you’re not, they turn off before they even hear a new song."<ref name=BeckoningFinger /> Coghill agreed with Haug on the album's popularity, stating "you couldn't ask for much better", and saying he really took notice of the album's positive critical commentary.<ref name=Feted /> Fanning agreed, saying that despite [[Polydor]] telling the band the album would be heavily marketed, it was still surprising to see its success.<ref name=Fish>{{cite news|title=Fish Tales|publisher=Juice|author=Clode, Samantha|date=December 1998|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>

''Internationalist'' was not praised as highly by [[All Music Guide]] reviewer Jonathan Lewis as for Powderfinger's previous album, ''Double Allergic''. Lewis stated that "much of the album was a mix of styles and ideas that didn't quite sit right as a whole".<ref name="AMG" /> He contended that the high point of the album is "The Day You Come", viewing it as "haunting", but believed the rest of the album was not of the same standard as the song.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=http://wm01.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hbftxq8jldje|title=Internationalist > Overview|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|author=Jonathan Lewis|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref>

James Bishop, a reviewer for Sputnikmusic, described ''Internationalist'' as a "beautiful, incomparable and truly surprising album", giving the album a perfect five.<ref name=Sputnikmusic /> Bishop stated that the album is a "roller-coaster ride from start to finish" and that Powderfinger are "making great music".<ref name=Sputnikmusic>{{cite web|url=http://sputnikmusic.com/album.php?reviewid=6102|title=Powderfinger Internationalist review|publisher=Sputnikmusic|author=James Bishop|date=[[8 April]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref>

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Tracey Grimson also praised the album, stating it had "a heightened sense of subtlety, a pulled-back demeanour and choruses which weave themselves mildly out of the dark".<ref name=RollingStone /> Grimson's main praise was for the album's cohesion, declaring that it could be identified as a  "solid album" rather than a group of good songs "thrown together".<ref name=RollingStone /> She also approved of the "glorious backing vocals" of [[Tiddas]].<ref name=RollingStone /> Grimson's final comment was for Fanning's lyrical sentiments, stating that they were "obviously strong, but conveyed simplistically, without convolution or being overbearing",<ref name=RollingStone /> and that they contributed to "the gelling together of ''Internationalist''".<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite news|title=Internationalist review|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|author=Tracy Grimson|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>

''Juice'' magazine approved of the album, but stated that Powderfinger fans may not enjoy it as much as previous work. The review labelled ''Internationalist'' as more subtle than its predecessor, and said that "Internationalist is more sophisticated and restrained".<ref name=JuiceReview /> The review said that the album didn't attempt to top ''Double Allergic'', but instead worked on a new level - a level which Powderfinger fans might not be ready for yet.<ref name=JuiceReview>{{cite news|title=Internationalist review|publisher=Juice|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>
