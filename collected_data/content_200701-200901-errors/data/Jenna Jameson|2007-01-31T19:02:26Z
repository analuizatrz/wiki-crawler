==Biography==
===Early life===
Jenna Marie Massoli was born [[April 9]] [[1974]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Her father was Lawrence Massoli, an [[Italian-American]] program director for an [[NBC]] affiliate and a [[police officer]]. Her mother was Judith Brooke Hunt Massoli, a Las Vegas [[showgirl]] who danced in the [[Folies-Bergère]] show at the [[Tropicana Resort & Casino]].<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=ReviewJournal>[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Sep-08-Wed-2004/news/24719744.html "Porn star's book walks wild side"], by [[Norm Clarke]], ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', [[September 8]], [[2004]]</ref> Her mother died of [[skin cancer]] on [[February 20]], [[1976]], before Jenna's second birthday.<ref name=ETHS/> The cancer treatments bankrupted the family and they moved several times, including living in a trailer and moving in with her father's mother. Her father spent most of his time at work at the Las Vegas [[Sheriff]]'s Department, and she became very close to her brother, Tony Massoli.<ref name=Higginbotham>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/07/1097089474673.html "The porn broker"], by Adam Higginbotham, [[October 9]], [[2004]], ''[[Telegraph Magazine]]'', presented by [[The Age]]. Also reprinted in a slightly edited form as [http://www.smh.com.au/news/Books/A-life-of-ups-and-downs/2004/12/03/1101923326974.html "A life of ups and downs"], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', [[December 4]], [[2004]]</ref> During her childhood, she took [[ballet]] classes, which helped her future career as a [[striptease|stripper]], and was a frequent entrant in beauty pageants.<ref name=AskMen>[http://www.askmen.com/women/models_250/262c_jenna_jameson.html "Jenna Jameson"] [[AskMen.com]] Model of the Week feature</ref>

In October 1990, while the family was living on a cattle ranch in [[Fromberg, Montana]], she was beaten with rocks and [[gang rape]]d by four boys after a [[American football|football]] game. She provides graphic details in her autobiography.<ref name=Higginbotham/> She writes:

{{cquote|Was I in this business because I was victimised or because I wanted to succeed at something? I examined it from every angle I could, and every time came to the same conclusion: that it didn't make a shred of difference. It occurred too late in my development to be formative. Whether it had happened or not, I still would have become a porn star. I've been to enough therapists to know that.<ref name=Higginbotham/>}}

Massoli says she was raped a second time, while still sixteen, by her boyfriend Jack's [[biker]] uncle, Preacher.<ref name=Higginbotham/> (Preacher has denied this.)<ref name=CNN>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/09/08/review.jameson/ "Review: Jenna Jameson's crazy porn life"] by Adam Dunn, [[September 8]] [[2004]], [[CNN]].</ref> Rather than tell her father, she left home and moved in with Jack in her first serious relationship.<ref name=ETHS/><ref name=January>[http://www.januarymagazine.com/biography/pornstar.html "Jennasis"], by Adrian Marks, ''[[January Magazine]]'', September 2004.</ref> 

Jack was a [[tattoo]] artist, and gave her what became her trademark tattoo of double hearts. The tattoo, her first, was on her right buttock.<ref name=Forbes/><ref name=Grigoriadis/> Massoli's brother Tony, who later owned a tattoo parlor himself,<ref name=NYTimes/> added the inscription "HEART BREAKER".<ref name=ETHS/>

===Early career===
Jenna Massoli tried to follow in her mother's career as a [[Las Vegas]] [[showgirl]], but most shows rejected her for not having the required height of 5&nbsp;feet 9&nbsp;inches (175&nbsp;cm).<ref name=ReviewJournalShowgirls>[http://www.reviewjournal.com/employment/vegasjobs/entertainer.html "Showgirls vs. dancers"], ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', [[July 27]], [[2004]]</ref><ref name=Papermag/> She was hired at the [[Vegas World]] show,<ref name=NYTimes/> but left after two months because the schedule was "brutal ... and the money was terrible".<ref name=January/>

Massoli's boyfriend Jack encouraged her to apply for jobs as an [[exotic dancer]],<ref name=Grigoriadis/> and in 1991, though [[underage]], she began dancing in Las Vegas strip clubs using a [[Identity document forgery|fake I.D.]]<ref name=ETHS/><ref name=AskMen/> Initially rejected from the [[Crazy Horse Too]] strip club because of the [[dental braces|braces]] on her teeth, they quickly relented when she removed them with a pair of [[needle-nosed pliers]]<ref name=Forbes/> (by some accounts with the aid of her brother).<ref name=ETHS/> After six months, she was earning [[United States dollar|US$]]2000 per night, before finishing [[high school]].<ref name=ETHS/> 

Her first stage name as a stripper was "Jennasis"<ref name=ReviewJournal/> (a name she later used for incorporating as "Jennasis Entertainment").<ref name=WIPO>[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2004/d2004-1042.html "WIPO Domain Name Decision:  D2004-1042"], Nels T. Lippert, [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], [[February 15]], [[2005]]</ref>  She chose the name "Jenna Jameson" to use as a model from scrolling through the phone book for a last name that matched her first name. She finally decided on Jameson for [[Jameson Whiskey]], which she drinks.<ref name=ETHS/><ref>[http://www.metacafe.com/watch/124500/jenna_jameson/ "Jenna Jameson: Ever wonder how she got her name?"] Video at Metacafe.com</ref>

Besides dancing, starting later in 1991, she would pose for nude photographs for photographer [[Suze Randall]] in [[Los Angeles]], hoping to get into ''[[Penthouse magazine|Penthouse]]'' magazine.<ref name=January/><ref name=Autobio>Jameson, Jenna with [[Neil Strauss|Strauss, Neil]] (2004). ''How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale'', New York: [[Regan Books]]. ISBN 0-06-053909-7</ref> Jameson was paid $300 per day, without rights to the pictures.

While still in high school, Jameson began taking drugs&mdash;[[cocaine]], [[LSD]], and [[methamphetamine]]s&mdash;accompanied by her brother, who was addicted to [[heroin]],<ref name=NYTimes/> and at times even her father.<ref name=Higginbotham/> Her addiction became worse during her four years with her boyfriend. She eventually stopped eating properly and became too thin to model; Jack left her in 1994. She weighed 76&nbsp;pounds (less than 35&nbsp;kilograms)<ref name=PsychiatricServices>[http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/57/5/729 "Book Reviews: Women's Search for Love Through Sex"], Jeffrey Geller, M.D., M.P.H., May 2006, ''[[Psychiatric Services]]'', [[American Psychiatric Association]]</ref> when a friend put her in a wheelchair and sent her to her father to [[detox]]; her father didn't recognize her when she got off the plane.<ref name=Higginbotham/> He was then living in [[California]], home of the [[Pornography in the United States|American adult film industry]].<ref name=ETHS/>

Jameson's first pornographic film appearances were female only [[lesbian]] scenes. She says: "Girl-on-girl was easy and natural. Then they offered me lots of money to do boy-girl."<ref name=Papermag/> Her first heterosexual scene was in ''Cherry Pie'' (1994).<ref name=ETHS/> At the beginning of her career, she promised herself never to do [[anal sex]] or [[double penetration]] scenes on film;<ref name=Grigoriadis/> she has also avoided [[interracial]] scenes with men.<ref name=Bridge>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060522031314/http://www.bridgemagazine.org/online/features/archive/000113.php "Jenna Does Jenna"], by Noah Berlatsky, ''Bridge'' magazine, 2004</ref> Instead, her "signature move" was [[oral sex]], lubricated with plenty of saliva.<ref name=AskMenInterview>[http://www.askmen.com/toys/interview/43b_jenna_jameson_interview.html "Jenna Jameson professional heartbreaker"], [[AskMen.com]] interview</ref><ref name=Salon2>[http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2001/01/18/jenna_2/index.html "Jenna the sex goddess"], by Peter Keating, [[January 18]] [[2001]], [[Salon.com|''Salon'' magazine]]</ref> 

In 1994, after overcoming her addiction by spending several weeks with her father and grandmother recovering on butter and [[focaccia]] bread, Jameson relocated to [[Los Angeles]] to live with Nikki Tyler.<ref name=Autobio/><ref name=LukeIsBack/> She started modeling again, and in 1995 got her father's blessing to make a career out of adult films.<ref name=ETHS/><ref name=Higginbotham/> Her first movie after that was ''Silk Stockings''.<ref name=Autobio/> Later in 1995, [[Wicked Pictures]], a then small pornographic film production company, signed her to an exclusive contract.<ref name=Autobio/><ref name=Forbes/> She remembers telling Wicked Pictures founder [[Steve Orenstein]]:

{{Cquote|The most important thing to me right now is to become the biggest star the industry has ever seen.<ref name=Higginbotham/><ref name=SalonBookReview/>}}

The contract earned Jameson [[United States dollar|US$]]6,000 for each of eight movies in her first year.<ref name=ETHS/> Her first big-budget production was ''Blue Movie'' (1995), where she played a reporter investigating a porn set; it won multiple [[AVN Awards]].<ref name=AskMen/> In 1996, Jameson won top awards from three major industry organizations, the [[X-Rated Critics Organization|XRCO]] Best New Starlet award, the [[AVN Best New Starlet Award]], and the [[Fans of X-Rated Entertainment (FOXE)]] Video Vixen award.

By 2001, Jameson earned $60,000 for a day and a half of filming a single DVD, and $8,000 per night dancing at strip clubs.

The autobiography publisher, [[Judith Regan]], also served as executive producer of a [[tie-in]] television news special, ''Jenna Jameson's Confessions'',<ref name=Confessions>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/85657/episode.jhtml "VH1 News Presents: Jenna Jameson's Confessions"] official web page for the ''VH1 News'' episode, [[VH1]]</ref> airing on [[VH1]] on [[August 16]] [[2004]], one day before the book's launch.<ref name=ConfessionsAiring>[http://www.orlandofloridaguide.com/entertainment/television/vh1.htm "Jenna Jameson Bares It All in the VH1 News Special 'Jenna Jameson's Confessions'"] Orlando Florida Guide Television News</ref> But all did not go smoothly for their further relations, as in April 2005, ReganBooks and Jameson filed lawsuits against each other. The point of contention was a proposed [[reality show]] about Jameson's everyday life, discussed between her husband, [[Jay Grdina]], and the [[A&E Network]]. ReganBooks maintained that any A&E deal was a breach of Jameson's contract, which indicated that ReganBooks had a stake in the profits generated by both the special based on her memoir and a reality-based series, as well as "any similar projects".<ref name=CNNMoney>[http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/13/news/newsmakers/jameson_lawsuit/index.htm "Porn star said to battle publisher"] ''[[CNN Money]]'', [[April 13]], [[2005]]</ref> Jameson's suit claimed that the A&E deal preceded the ReganBooks contract.<ref name=EOnline>[http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=480f7855-a2e9-4840-bdd5-5d5f26490c78  "Jenna Hot for Lawsuit"], by Josh Grossberg, [[E!]] Online, [[15 April]], [[2005]]</ref> The reality series had still not materialized, and the lawsuit was still being discussed, when Judith Regan was fired by HarperCollins on [[December 15]] [[2006]] over unrelated controversy.<ref name=NYTimesRegan>{{Cite web| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/business/media/16book.html?ex=1323925200&en=3f3db5a0a595365f&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title="Editor Fired After Uproar Over Simpson"| accessdate=2006-12-18| publisher=The New York Times| year=[[December 16]] [[2006]]| author=Edward Wyatt| work=Business}}</ref>

In the summer of 1998, Jameson met former pornographic studio owner [[Jay Grdina]] (born John G.

[[Image:Briana Loves Jenna.jpg|left|thumb|Cover of ''Briana Loves Jenna'' (2001), first Club Jenna produced film, best selling and best renting title of its year, starring Jameson and [[Briana Banks]].]]

Jameson and Grdina formed [[Club Jenna]] as an [[Internet pornography]] company in 2000. ClubJenna.com was one of the first adult sites to provide more than pictures and videos; it provided explicit diaries, relationship advice, and even stock tips to paid members. The site was profitable in its third week. Club Jenna the company diversified, becoming a multi-media adult entertainment business, first by administering other porn stars' Web sites, then, in 2001, by production of adult films.<ref name=Forbes/> 

Early Club Jenna films starred Jameson herself, limiting herself to on-screen sex with other women or with Grdina, who appeared as [[Justin Sterling]]. The first ClubJenna film, ''Briana Loves Jenna'' (2001), co-produced with Vivid, cost [[United States dollar|US$]]280,000 to make, but grossed over $1 million in its first year. It was the best selling and best renting pornographic title of its year, winning twin [[AVN Awards 2003|AVN Awards]].<ref name=Forbes/><ref name=JJJBio>[http://justjennajameson.com/bio.html JustJennaJameson.com bio] official fan site biography. [http://www.playboy.com/playboytv/original_series/americansexstar/jennabio.html Also mirrored] on Playboy TV.</ref> It was marketed as "Jenna. Her first boy/girl scene in over 2 years." referring to Jameson's abstention from heterosexual on-film intercourse. Grdina has said that Jameson's films averaged sales of 100,000 copies, compared to run-of-the-mill adult films, which did well to sell 5,000. On the other hand, he also said that their films took up to twelve days to film, compared to one day for other adult films.<ref name=WallStreetJournal/>

In 2004, the Club Jenna films expanded to starring other actresses without Jameson - [[Krystal Steal]], [[Jesse Capelli]], [[McKenzie Lee]], [[Ashton Moore]] and [[Sophia Rossi]] - as Jameson stepped back from starring roles.<ref name=Forbes/> In 2005, Jameson directed her first film, ''The Provocateur'', released as ''Jenna's Provocateur'' in [[September]] of [[2006]].<ref name=AVN>[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&Action=View_Article&Content_ID=242733 "The Provocateur: Jenna Makes Directorial Debut"], by Peter Stokes, ''[[Adult Video News]]'', [[October 7]], [[2005]]</ref> The films were distributed and marketed by [[Vivid Entertainment]], the world's largest adult film company. They made up a third of ClubJenna's revenues, but over half of the profits.<ref name=Forbes/>

Club Jenna was run as a family business, with Grdina's sister, Kris, as Vice President in charge of merchandising.<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=Hoovers/> In 2005, Club Jenna had estimated revenues of $30 million, with profits of approximately half that.<ref name=Forbes/> 

Merchandising capitalized on Jameson herself.

Club Jenna kept diversifying. In August 2005, Club Jenna launched Club Thrust, an interactive website for Jameson's [[gay]] male fans, which includes videos, galleries, sex advice, gossip, and downloads. The director of webmaster relations for Club Jenna said the straight site had always had a lot of gay traffic.<ref name=AVNClubThrust>[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&Action=View_Article&Content_ID=236769 "Club Jenna, NakedSword.com Unveil Jenna-Branded Gay Site – Club Thrust"], by Todd Lewis, Adult Video News, [[August 19]], [[2005]]</ref><ref name=>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8123-2022137,00.html "Agony and ecstasy: sex advice"], by Suzi Godson, ''[[The Times]]'', [[February 04]], [[2006]]</ref> By 2006, Club Jenna administered more than 150 official sites for other adult entertainment industry stars.<ref name=Hoovers/>

In August 2005, a partnership that included Jameson purchased Babes Cabaret, a [[strip club]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], intending to make it the first foray of Club Jenna into live entertainment.<ref name=ArizonaRepublic1>[http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/0813sr-jameson13Z8.html "Porn star buys Babes Cabaret"], by Casey Newton, [[The Arizona Republic]], [[August 13]], [[2005]]</ref><ref name=ArizonaRepublic2>[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0813nejameson13.html "Porn actress has purchased Babes Cabaret"], [[The Arizona Republic]], [[August 13]], [[2005]]</ref> Soon after the purchase attracted attention, the Scottsdale City Council proposed a new ordinance banning nudity at adult-entertainment venues and requiring a four-foot divider restricting contact with dancers.

Jameson voiced an [[animated]] version of herself in a July 2001 episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' entitled "[[Brian Does Hollywood]]". She acts in a porn film directed by [[Brian Griffin]] (the dog) which wins an award. At the close of the episode she is kidnapped and taken home by [[Peter Griffin]].

Some of her mainstream appearances sparked controversy.

However, these were minor appearances on the fringes of the mainstream. It was the 2004 success of her [[#Autobiography|autobiography]] that truly brought her the mass-market fame she wanted.
