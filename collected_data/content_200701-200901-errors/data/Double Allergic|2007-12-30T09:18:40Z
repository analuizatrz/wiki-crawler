'''''Double Allergic''''' is the second [[studio album]] by [[Australia]]n [[alternative rock]] [[band (music)|band]], [[Powderfinger]], released on [[2 September]], [[1996]] in Australia through [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]. The album was produced by Australian [[Tim Whitten]], and was widely considered Powderfinger's mainstream breakthrough&mdash;it has been certified triple platinum, with over 200,000 copies sold. ''Double Allergic'' was also nominated for five [[ARIA awards]], with singles from the album nominated for an additional four, however it didn't win any.

==Recording and production==
''Double Allergic'' contained material that had been written by Powderfinger in 1995 and 1996. Prior to its release, [[guitarist]] [[Darren Middleton]] described it as "by far the best thing we've done",<ref name=RaveMag /> an analogy that would be commonly made in the future when comparing the album to its predecessor, ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]''. Middleton said the album was good because the band new the sound they wanted before they started work on it; he also described it as "the most concise continuation of who we are down on record".<ref name=RaveMag>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl14.htm|title=Make Mine A Double|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=2007-12-20|work=Rave Magazine|author=Angie Lawrence|date=1996}}</ref>

[[Lead singer]], [[Bernard Fanning]], noted that another important element of the album was that there "was more space in the songs, it wasn't overcrowded".<ref name=IINM /> However, Fanning commented that Powderfinger hadn't intended to greatly change their sound in creating ''Double Allergic''&mdash;instead, the change in sound came as a natural progression.<ref name=IINM>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/article7.htm|title=I Is Not Me|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Drum Media|author=Peter Blythe|date=[[29 October]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> Guitarist [[Ian Haug]] agreed, stating the music was "more melodic and sort of simpler", without "so many different time signatures and things".<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/article6.htm|title=Powder Me Up|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Concrete Press|date=[[29 October]] [[1996]]|author=Jack Basil|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' author Tracey Grimson also commented on this, stating that "Powderfinger have become practical advocates of space" and lauding their acknowledgment that the "absence of sound can be lush, evocative". She noted that even in the "rockers" on the album; songs like "[[Pick You Up]]" and "Skinny Jean", the band were still able to pull back and give the songs additional space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl27.htm|title=Powderfinger - Break the Barrier|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|author=Tracey Grimson|date=[[January 1997]]|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref>

Powderfinger spent less money in producing ''Double Allergic'' than on their previous work. Previously, the band had worked with [[Tony Cohen]], whom Fanning stated was expensive due to his success in the industry. For ''Double Allergic'' the band chose [[Tim Whitten]], a less well known producer, and because the band knew what they intended to do as they entered the studio, they managed to spend less money despite the improved sound.<ref name=IINM /> Middleton commented on Whitten's capabilities in the recording studio, saying "He's what a band looks for in a producer/engineer, because he's got his own ideas", but stating that Whitten would also listen to and appreciate the band's ideas.<ref name=Budden>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/article2.htm|title=Powder Pick Up To Cure All Your Allergies.|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Concrete Press|author=Matt Budden|date=[[14 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref>

"[[Pick You Up]]", the first [[single (music)|single]], was released on [[13 April]] [[1996]], and entered the ARIA singles chart at #34. By its fifth week, on [[30 June]], it had reached its peak at #23 - it spent a further seven weeks on the chart before dropping out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=286153&cat=s |title=Pick You Up|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> "Pick You Up" was described as having a "very professional sound".<ref name=Budden /> The song appeared at #6 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1996]].<Ref name=JJJ>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/history/1996.htm|title=Hottest 100 1996|publisher=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> "[[D.A.F. (song)|D.A.F.]]", the second single, was released on [[5 August]] [[1996]]. It spent four weeks on the ARIA chart, peaking at #39.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=286154&cat=s |title=D.A.F.|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> The title of the song was taken from its [[chord]] progression, in the words of [[bassist]] [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] "because we were stupid".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/daf.htm|title=D.A.F.|publisher=Hindley Site|work=Songs|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref><ref name=RaveMag /> The song appeared at #18 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1996]].<Ref name=JJJ />

"[[Living Type]]" was the third single, released on [[11 November]] [[1996]]. The song peaked at #42 on the ARIA charts and stayed in the top 50 for three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=286155&cat=ss |title=Living Type|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> "Living Type" was written by Fanning about the [[Manson Family]] [[cult]], and came with an ''[[X-Files]]'' style [[music video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/song_file/%5Eliving.htm|title=Living Type|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Song files|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> The song appeared at #32 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1996]].<Ref name=JJJ /> The fourth single, "[[Take Me In]]", was released on [[12 May]] [[1997]]. It failed to chart, and was the least noted single from the album. Fanning wrote "Take Me In" as a response to [[hypocrisy]] by [[police]], which he had read about in [[newspaper]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/song_file/%5Etake.htm |title=Take Me In|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Song files|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref>

The album contains three [[secret track]]s placed onto the twelfth track after silence that follows the track's primary song "(The Return of) The Electric Horseman". The first of these is called "Vladimir" which, according to Fanning is about a transvestite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/vladmir.htm|title=Vladimir|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> The second song is called "SS" which refers to Australian cricket bat manufacturer [[Stuart Surridge]], which is often known as ''SS''. The song refers in part to the bat itself, though mostly to cricket in general, with lyrics "''Then we'll race like jets for the fading moon; Then we all fall down''", which refers to running for the opposite crease following striking the ball, and then diving to the ground to secure the [[run (cricket)|run]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/ss.htm|publisher=Hindley Site|title=SS|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> The third and final secret track is called "Come Away" which also featured as a B-side for the single of "Pick You Up". In a first for the group, it featured guitarist Darren Middleton as lead vocalist, while a spoken sound sample at the end of the song features bass guitarist John Collins' voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/ComeAway.htm|title=Come Away|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref>

==Critical response==
''Double Allergic'' was well received by ''[[All Music Guide]]'', with reviewer Jonathan Lewis claiming that Powderfinger "managed to successfully create an album of melodic pop songs coupled with noisy guitars". The album was summarised as "a cohesive and mature effort".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wm01.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hxfexqrhldde~T1|title=Double Allergic > Review|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|author=Jonathan Lewis|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

''Sputnikmusic'' reviewer blueyxd, had mixed feelings about the album. The level of experimentation in the album was praised, with the reviewer stating that "the instrument playing and some of the unusual styles used" were beneficial. However, the main concern was that there wasn't enough experimentation, and that the album was rather "solid", thus earning it its score of 3.5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=1257|title=Powderfinger Double Allergic|publisher=Sputnikmusic|author=blueyxd|date=[[16 January]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

''Juice'' [[magazine]] reviewed ''Double Allergic'' positively, calling it a much more mature album than its predecessor, ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]''. The "band's mellowing tone", compared to the "aggression" in past works, was also commended, with the review stating that "the result is an album filled with potential and character." The experimentation on "[[JC (song)|JC]]", "Glimpse", and "[[Oipic]]" was again praised, with comparisons to [[Motown]] drawn. The review summarised the album as "proof of a band maturing, streets ahead of anything they've previously recorded".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hindleysite.com/reviews/doubleallergic_juice.htm|title=Double Allergic Review|publisher=Hindley Site|work=Juice|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>
