'''Sligo''' ({{lang-ga|Sligeach}}) ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced  "sly-go"]] {{IPA|[slaɪˈgoʊ]}}), is the [[county town]] of County Sligo in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The town is a [[borough]] and has a [[charter]] and a town [[mayor]]. It is the second biggest urban area in Connacht (after [[Galway]]). Sligo's population dropped at the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|2006 census]].<ref>Western Development Commission website http://www.wdc.ie/countyprofiles_sligo.html</ref>

==History==
Sligo's Irish name Sligeach - meaning shelly place - originates in the abundance of [[shellfish]] found in the river and its estuary, and from the extensive '[[midden#Shell middens|shell middens]]' or Stone Age food preparation areas in the vicinity.<ref>See Deirdre Flanagan and Laurence Flanagan, ''Irish Place Names'', Gill & MacMillan, ISBN 0-7171-2066-X. Flanagan & Flanagan suggest ''abounding in shells'' as the meaning of Sligeach. The [http://www.sligoborough.ie/asp/AboutUs/HistorySligo.asp Sligo council web site] says ''Shelly place''.</ref> The river (now known as the Garavogue) was originally also called the Sligeach.<ref>See [http://www.booksulster.com/library/plnm/placenamesS.php].</ref> The [[Ordnance Survey]] letters of [[1836]] state that "cart loads of shells were found underground in many places within the town where houses now stand". At that time shells were constantly being dug up during the construction of foundations for buildings. This whole area, from the river estuary at Sligo, around the coast to the river at [[Ballysadare]] Bay, was rich in marine resources which were utilised as far back as the [[Mesolithic]] period.

Sligo town's first roundabout was constructed around a megalithic tomb (Abbeyquarter North, in Garavogue Villas place<ref> Landscape of the monuments. A study of the passage tombs in the Cúil Irra region, Co. Sligo, Ireland: Stefan Bergh, 1995. Stockholm: Riksantikvarieämbetet Arkeologiska Undersökningar</ref>)a phase of veneration at this ancient place.

In the medieval period Sligo was an important crossroads strategically and commercially.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} [[Sligo Abbey]], the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary, is the only medieval building left standing in the town. It was founded by the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, [[Maurice Fitzgerald]] in 1253 but accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was rebuilt in its present form. When Frederick Hamilton’s soldiers sacked Sligo Town in 1642, the Abbey was burned and everything valuable in it was destroyed. Much of the structure, including the choir, carved alter and cloisters remain.

Between 1847 and 1851 over 30,000 people emigrated through the [[port]] of Sligo.<ref>Lord Palmerston and the Irish Famine Emigration: A Rejoinder,  Desmond Norton, Cambridge University Press, The Historical Journal (2003),  46: 155-165 </ref> On the Quays, overlooking the [[River Garavogue|Garavogue]] River, is a memorial sculpture to those people. This is one of a suite of three sculptures commissioned by the Sligo Famine Commemoration Committee to honour the victims of the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|Great Famine]]. A plaque in the background, headed 'Letter to America, January 2, 1850' tells one family's sad story: "''I am now, I may say, alone in the world. All my brothers and sisters are dead and children but yourself... We are all ejected out of Mr. Enright's ground... The times was so bad and all [[Ireland]] in such a state of poverty that no person could pay rent. My only hope now rests with you, as I am without one shilling and as I said before I must either beg or go to the poorhouse... I remain your affectionate father, Owen Larkin. Be sure answer this by return of post.''"

It is said that the picturesque Coney Island in Sligo bay gives its name to [[Coney Island]] in [[New York City]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The Dutch expression ''Konijn Eiland'', often cited as the source of the name for Coney Island NY, has the same Latin origin as the Irish placename ''Oilean na gCoiníní''. (''Coinín'' means ''rabbit'' in [[Irish language|Irish]]. There are at least two Coney Islands in Ireland). The Latin word cuniculus means rabbit or underground passage. <ref>http://www.mithridates.com/?p=94</ref>. Quite a plethora of theories for the origin of the American Coney Island exist,{{Fact|date=June 2007}}but clearly the Sligo one comes from ‘the island of the rabbits’. John McTernan, the Sligo historian, relates that a Sligoman, Captain Peter O'Connor, named New York's Coney Island after the island that lay one mile from his Sligo home.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Captain O'Connor was master of the schooner [[Arethusa]], which plied between Sligo and New York 200 years ago.

The poet [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] is associated with Sligo. Much of his writing is descriptive of the area around Sligo town. In particular "[[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]]" is a reference to a small, uninhabited island on [[Lough Gill]], which is a lake adjacent to the town. (The poet was likely thinking of Beezies Island, a bigger island in the lake close to the mouth of the Garavogue and a popular place to row to in the nineteen hundreds.) Yeats, who spent much of his youth in Sligo and its environs, died in 1939 and is buried in the graveyard in [[Drumcliffe]], County Sligo<ref>http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Yeats_Grave_Drumcliffe_Sligo.jpg</ref>.

Sligo town is encircled by two mountain ranges, namely [[Dartry Mountains]] to the north and the [[Ox Mountains]] to the south. The Dartry range includes the famous [[Ben Bulben]] which W. B. Yeats often wrote about and is said to be the resting place of [[Diarmuid]] and [[Grainne]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  [[Knocknarea]] Mountain, located 3 miles west of the town, on the Cuil Irra Peninsula, is famous for the ([[Neolithic]]) stone cairn at its summit. According to folklore the [[cairn]] is said to be the resting place of Queen Maeve (or ''[[Medb]]'' in Irish), who ruled Connacht.

Sligo town recently highlighted its connections with famous [[Goon Show]] star and writer [[Spike Milligan]] by unveiling a plaque at the former Milligan family home at Number 5 Holborn Street.<ref>Spike_Milligan.

==Transport==
Sligo has a modern road network, being served by a dual-carriageway "Inner-Relief Road" and connected to Dublin through the [[N4 road]], which is of dual-carriageway standard in Sligo (and outside Sligo) and motorway standard in some areas.

The Sligo County Council ‘Traffic & Transportation Plan’ identified the pedestrianisation of Sligo’s core streets as a priority following the opening of the Sligo Inner Relief Road.

Sligo acquired rail links to [[Dublin]] in 1862, [[Enniskillen]] and the north in 1881 and [[Limerick]] and the south in 1895. The line to Enniskillen closed in 1957 and passenger services to Limerick in 1963. For many years [[Córas Iompair Éireann|CIE]] kept the latter line open for freight traffic, and although it is now disused, it forms part of the [[Western Rail Corridor]] redevelopment project. In 1966 Sligo railway station was renamed [[Sligo Mac Diarmada Station|Mac Diarmada Station]] after Irish rebel [[Seán Mac Diarmada]] from [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]]. [[Iarnród Éireann]], Ireland's national [[railway]] operator, runs [[inter-city rail]] services between Sligo and Dublin.<ref>[http://www.sligoweekender.ie/news/story.asp?j=31127]</ref> 

Sligo Town and County Sligo are served by [[Sligo Airport]], 8&nbsp;kilometres (5&nbsp;miles) from Sligo town and close to [[Strandhill]] village, which operates flights to Dublin and to Manchester in the [[United Kingdom]].

Sligo port handles relatively small ships up to 2,000 [[deadweight|dwt]].<ref>{{cite web | | title = A Profile of County Sligo | url = http://www.sligoenterprise.ie/sligo_county_profile.html#sea | format = HTML | publisher = Sligo County Enterprise Board| accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref>

== Development ==
[[Image:Border diagram 2007.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Sligo Hub & Gateway access]]
Like many towns in rural areas of Ireland, Sligo suffered for many years from the lack of development in the town. However this has improved in some sectors in the past decade. A lot of new development has been situated along the small river, the Garavogue, most notably the regeneration of J.F.K. and Rockwood Parades, consisting of houses, bars and a number of apartments as well as a new footbridge over the river itself. The most recent addition to the riverside is the new Glasshouse Hotel, a seven storey four star hotel. A large apartment development is underway further along the river. 

O’Connell Street, the town's main  street has been pedestrianised since August 2006. The new Johnston's Court mall, on O'Connell Street is nearing completion. There is a [[Four Lanterns]] outlet in the town.
