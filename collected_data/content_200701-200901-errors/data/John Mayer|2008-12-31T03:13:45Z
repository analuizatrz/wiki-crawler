In 2003, he won a [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]".

Mayer began his career performing mainly acoustic [[rock music|rock]], but gradually began a transition towards the [[blues]] genre in 2005 by collaborating with renowned blues artists such as [[B. B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], and [[Eric Clapton]], and by forming the [[John Mayer Trio]]. The blues influence can be heard on his album ''[[Continuum (album)|Continuum]]'', released in September 2006. At the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2007 Mayer won [[Best Pop Vocal Album]] for ''Continuum'' and [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for "[[Waiting on the World to Change]]".

By the end of 2002, ''Room for Squares'' had spawned several radio hits, including "No Such Thing," "[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]," (originally titled "Ann Marie") and ultimately, "[[Why Georgia]]." In 2003, Mayer won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for "Your Body Is a Wonderland." In his acceptance speech he remarked, "This is very, very fast, and I promise to catch up."<ref>Bream, Jon (2007).

In 2003, Mayer released a live CD and DVD of a concert in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] entitled, ''[[Any Given Thursday]]''. The concert featured songs previously not recorded, such as "Man on the Side" (co-written with Cook) and "[[Something's Missing]]", which later appeared on ''[[Heavier Things]]''. The concert also included "Covered In Rain". According to the accompanying DVD documentary, this song is "part two" of the song "City Love", which features the line "covered in rain". Commercially, the album quickly peaked at number seventeen on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. The CD/DVD received conservative, although consistent, praise, with critics torn between his pop-idol image, and (at the time) emerging guitar prowess. Erik Crawford (of [[Allmusic]]) asked "Is he the consummate guitar hero exemplified when he plays a cover of Stevie Ray Vaughan's 'Lenny', or is he the teen idol that the pubescent girls shriek for after he plays 'Your Body Is a Wonderland?'"<ref>Crawford, Erik (2003).

In addition to guitars, Mayer's handiwork ranges from T-shirts, guitar totes and, most dear to his heart, sneakers. In August 2006, Mayer started JMltd, a minor clothing line of Mayer-themed merchandise that he has designed. The products are currently available online through his website store.

===Writing===
With the June 1, 2004, issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Mayer began a column called, "Music Lessons with John Mayer". Each article featured a lesson and his (often humorous) take on various topics, both of personal and popular interest. In the August 2005 issue, he invited readers to create music for orphaned lyrics he had written.<ref name=contest>Mayer, John (September 2005), [http://www.esquire.com/features/music/ESQ0106MUSIC_38 "The Giveaway: John Mayer's Songwriting Contest"] ''Esquire''.

''Esquire''. '''145''' (1):38</ref>

Mayer has been active online, and has maintained four blogs: a MySpace page, a blog at his official site, another at Honeyee.com (which was no longer available as of late December 2008), as well as a [[photoblog]] at StunningNikon.com. Although they primarily deal with career-related matters, they also contain jokes, comedic videos, his convictions, and his personal activities; they occasionally overlap in content. He is noted for writing the blogs himself, and not through a publicist.<ref name=time100/><ref name=MandS>[http://a1135.g.akamai.net/f/1135/18227/1h/cchannel.download.akamai.com/18227/podcast/RICHMOND-VA/WRVQ-FM/johnmayer2.mp3 "John Mayer"].

Mayer also maintains a YouTube account,<ref>http://www.youtube.com/user/mayermusic</ref> posting behind-the-scenes videos and humorous clips from both his tour and day-to-day life.

In the mid-2000s, stand-up comedy was a hobby of Mayer's. He would make random appearances at the famed [[Comedy Cellar]] in New York. While he said that it helped him write better,<ref name=RS06/> he said that media attention has made him have to be too careful about what he says; he also felt that he wasn't funny.<ref>"[[June 8]], [[2008]]".

Mayer allows audio taping at most of his live performances, and he also allows for the non-commercial trading of those recordings. He does this to give fans the opportunity to recreate the live experience, and to encourage fan interaction.<ref name=Local83>[http://www.local-83.com/web/guest/v2policies General Information] Local 83: Listener's Union. Retrieved on June 25, 2007.</ref> <!--BLANKED PENDING VERIFICATION Tape trading was also instrumental in Mayer becoming better known in the early stages of his career.-->

Mayer performed live in concert on December 6, 2008 in his 2nd Annual Charity Revue, titled "On His Own".  This concert is a follow-up to his 1st Annual Charity Revue, titled "[[Where the Light Is]]", which was released as both a DVD and CD.  The British singer [[Adele]] opened the show for him.  

==Personal life==
Mayer has a number of tattoos. These include: "Home" and "Life" (from the song title) on the back of his left and right arms respectively, "77" (his year of birth) on the left side of his chest, and a [[koi]]-like fish on his right shoulder. His entire left arm is covered in a [[sleeve tattoo]] that he acquired gradually, ending in April 2008; it includes: "SRV" (for his idol Stevie Ray Vaughan) on his shoulder, a decorated rectangle on his biceps, a dragon-like figure on his inner arm, and various other floral designs. In 2003, he got a tattoo of three squares on his right forearm, which, he has explained, he will fill in gradually.<ref name=blender>Collis, Clark (2003).
