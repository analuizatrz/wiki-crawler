A '''pseudoscorpion''', (also known as a ''false scorpion'' or ''book scorpion''), is an [[arachnid]] belonging to the order '''Pseudoscorpionida''', also known as Pseudoscorpiones or Chelonethida.

Pseudoscorpions are generally beneficial to humans since they prey on [[moth|clothes moth]] larvae, [[carpet beetle]] larvae, [[Psocoptera|booklice]], [[ant]]s, [[mite]]s, and small [[Diptera|flies]]. They are small and inoffensive, and are rarely seen due to their size. 

==Physical characteristics==
Pseudoscorpions are small arthropods with a flat, pear-shaped body and pincers that resemble those of [[scorpion]]s. They usually range from 2 to 8&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] ({{frac|1|12}} to ⅓&nbsp;[[inch]]) in length.<ref name=Penn>[[Pennsylvania State University]], Department of Entomology: [http://www.ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/pseudoscorpion.htm Entomological Notes: Pseudoscorpion Fact Sheet] </ref> The largest known species is ''[[Garypus titanius]]'' of [[Ascension Island]] at up to 12 mm.<ref name=Ascension>Ascension Island Conservation Centre: [http://www.ascensionconservation.org.ac/pdf/35-O-Endemic-invertebrates-leaflet.pdf Endemic invertebrates] </ref> <ref name=agric> Agricultural Research Council (South Africa): [http://www.arc.agric.za/home.asp?PID=1&ToolID=63&ItemID=1769 Pseudoscorpions] </ref>

The abdomen, known as the [[opisthosoma]], is made up of twelve segments, each protected by plates (called [[tergite]]s above and [[sternite]]s below) made of [[chitin]]. The abdomen is short and rounded at the rear, rather than extending into a segmented tail and stinger like true scorpions. The color of the body can be yellowish-tan to dark-brown, with the paired claws often a contrasting color. They may have two, four or no eyes.<ref name=agric /> 

A pseudoscorpion has eight legs with five to seven segments — the number of fused segments is used to distinguish families and genera. They have two very long ''palpal chelae'' ([[pedipalp]]s or pincers) which strongly resemble the pincers found on a scorpion. 

The pedipalps generally consist of an immobile "hand" and "finger", with a separate movable finger controlled by an [[adductor muscle]]. A [[venom (poison)|venom]] gland and duct are usually located in the mobile finger; the poison is used to capture and immobilize the pseudoscorpion's prey. During digestion, pseudoscorpions pour a mildly corrosive fluid over the prey, then ingest the liquefied remains.

Pseudoscorpions spin [[silk]] from a gland in their jaws to make disk-shaped [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s for mating, molting, or waiting out cold weather. Another trait they share with their closest relatives, the [[spider]]s, is breathing through [[spiracle]]s.  However, they do not have [[book lungs]] as most spiders do.

==Reproduction and growth==
Some species have an elaborate [[mating dance]], where the male pulls a female over a [[spermatophore]] previously laid upon a surface.<ref>Weygoldt 1966</ref> In other species, the male also pushes the sperm into the female genitals using the forelegs.<ref>Proctor 1993</ref>

The female carries the fertilized eggs in a [[brood pouch]] attached to her [[abdomen]], and the young ride on the mother for a short time after they hatch.<ref name=Penn /> Up to two dozen young are hatched in a single [[brood]]; there may be more than one brood per year. The young go through three [[ecdysis|molts]] over the course of several years before reaching adulthood. After reaching adulthood, pseudoscorpions live two to three years. They are active in the warm months of the year, overwintering in silken cocoons when the weather grows cold. 

==Geographical distribution==
[[Image:ar 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A book scorpion (''Chelifer cancroides'') could get lost in a book.]]
There are more than 3,300 species of pseudoscorpions recorded in more than 430 genera, with more being discovered on a regular basis. They range worldwide, even in temperate to cold regions like [[Northern Ontario]] and above timberline in Wyoming's Rocky Mountains in the [[United States]], but have their most dense and diverse populations in the [[tropical|tropics]] and subtropics. Species have been found under tree bark, in leaf and pine litter, in soil, in tree hollows, under stones, in caves, at the seashore in the intertidal zone, and within fractured rocks.<ref name=Penn /> They may sometimes be found feeding on mites under the wing covers of certain beetles.

''Chelifer cancroides'' is the species most commonly found in homes, where they are often observed in rooms with dusty books. There the tiny animals (2,5 to 4,5 mm) can find their food like booklice and house dust mites. They enter homes by "riding along" with larger insects (known as [[Commensalism|phoresy]]), or are brought in with firewood.

==Evolution==
Until recently, the oldest pseudoscorpion [[fossil]]s known were only 35 million years old, but in the late 1980s a fossil of ''[[Dracochela|Dracochela deprehendor]]'' was found dating back over ten times as far, 380 million years, to the [[Devonian]] period.<ref>Shear, W.A., Schawaller, W. & Bonamo, P. (1989): Record of Palaeozoic pseudoscorpions. - ''Nature'' 342 (6242): 527-529.</ref>  The fossil has all of the traits of a modern pseudoscorpion, indicating that the order matured very early in the history of land animals.<ref>Schawaller 1991</ref>

== Historical references ==
Pseudoscorpions were first described by [[Aristotle]], who probably found them among scrolls in a library where they would have been feeding on [[Psocoptera|booklice]]. [[Robert Hooke]] referred to a "Land-Crab" in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]''. Another reference in the 1780s, when [[George Adams (optician)|George Adams]] wrote of: "A lobster-insect, spied by some labouring men who were drinking their porter, and borne away by an ingenious gentleman, who brought it to my lodging." <ref>Adams 1787</ref>
