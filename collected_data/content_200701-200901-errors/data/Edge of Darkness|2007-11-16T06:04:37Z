'''''Edge of Darkness''''' is a [[British television]] [[drama]] [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]], produced by [[BBC Television]] in association with Lionheart Television International and originally broadcast in six fifty-five minute episodes in late [[1985]]. A mixture of [[crime fiction|crime drama]], [[political drama|political]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], and [[science fiction]], it revolves around the efforts of policeman Ronald Craven (played by [[Bob Peck]]) to unravel the truth behind the brutal killing of his daughter Emma (played by [[Joanne Whalley]]). Craven's investigations soon lead him into a murky world of Government and corporate cover-ups and nuclear espionage, pitting him against dark forces that threaten the future of life on Earth.

Writer [[Troy Kennedy Martin]] was greatly influenced by the political climate of the time – particularly  the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] administration, perceived by many as reactionary, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]] – and by the implications of the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of environmentalist [[James Lovelock]], crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and the mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial, proposing that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by other members of the cast and crew.

First broadcast on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], ''Edge of Darkness'' was met with widespread critical acclaim and quickly earned a repeat on [[BBC One|BBC1]]. Winner of several prestigious awards, it remains highly regarded to this day, often cited as one of the best and most influential pieces of British television drama ever made.

==Plot==
;One<nowiki>:</nowiki> Compassionate Leave
[[Yorkshire]] police officer Ronald Craven (Bob Peck) is returning home with his daughter Emma ([[Joanne Whalley]]) having picked her up from a meeting of an environmental organisation at her university campus. On the doorstep of their home Emma is shot dead. The police concentrate their effort on the theory that her murder was a botched attempt on Craven's life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a [[geiger counter]] and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. Travelling to [[London]] to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton ([[Charles Kay]]), a polished official “attached to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s office”, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] and that it was she, not Craven, who was the gunman's target.
;Two<nowiki>:</nowiki> Into The Shadows
As he continues his investigations, Craven has visions of Emma, and it is never clear whether she is actually appearing to him as a [[ghost]] or whether she is a product of his imagination. The [[fingerprints]] on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven to meet his colleague, Harcourt ([[Ian McNeice]]), who informs him that Emma was a member of a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a [[low level waste|low level radioactive waste]] facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Darius Jedburgh ([[Joe Don Baker]]), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radiation, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing [[plutonium]]. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.
;Three<nowiki>:</nowiki> Burden Of Proof
The police close in on their suspect, Lowe ([[Roy Heather]]), who is severely injured in a fall while trying to escape. Dying, he tells Craven he was working with McCroon, a terrorist Craven had had convicted in [[Northern Ireland]]. Emma's boyfriend, Terry Shields ([[Tim McInnerny]]), tells Craven that she was investigating a [[hot cell]] in Northmoor; he is later killed. Craven meets Harcourt and Pendleton at the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] where an inquiry is taking place into the sale of International Irradiated Fuels (IIF) – Northmoor's owners – to the Fusion Corporation of Kansas, owned by Jerry Grogan ([[Kenneth Nelson]]). Pendleton tells Craven that he believes Grogan was behind Emma's death. Returning to Yorkshire for Emma's funeral, Craven is refused permission to seek a warrant to enter Northmoor. Returning home, he is observed by McCroon ([[Sean Caffrey]]).
;Four<nowiki>:</nowiki> Breakthrough
McCroon breaks into Craven's house intent on killing him. Craven demands McCroon tell him who he is working for but McCroon is shot by a police [[marksman]] before he can say anything. Through a contact of Mac (Struan Roger), a colleague from his time in Northern Ireland, Craven gains access to a terminal connected to the [[MI5]] computer. He checks the MI5 records for GAIA, Northmoor and Emma and learns that McCroon was acting on the orders of Northmoor Security. He also obtains a three-dimensional map of Northmoor from the computer. Craven contacts Jedburgh and asks him to accompany him inside Northmoor.
;Five<nowiki>:</nowiki> Northmoor
Craven and Jedburgh penetrate Northmoor and discover the hot cell which has been sealed off following an explosion - a consequence of GAIA's attempted break-in. Jedburgh, under orders from the CIA, enters the hot cell and steals the plutonium. At the House of Commons inquiry, IIF chief executive Robert Bennett ([[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]]) is forced to admit the presence of plutonium at Northmoor and the deaths of the GAIA team.
;Six<nowiki>:</nowiki> Fusion
Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor but both are dying from [[radiation poisoning]]. Jedburgh makes for the [[Gleneagles Hotel]] in [[Scotland]], which is hosting a [[NATO]] conference on directed energy weapons. Also present at the conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing the power of the atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a [[criticality accident]] and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.

Emma's ghost appears to Craven and tells him of a time when black flowers grew, warming the Earth and preventing life from becoming [[extinction|extinct]]. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh from the next step in his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland with the rest of the plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. Craven, like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing.

Aside from the Clapton/Kamen soundtrack, [[Willie Nelson]]'s "The Time of the Preacher", [[New Model Army]]'s "Christian Militia", and [[Tom Waits]]' "16 Shells From A 30.6", feature in the series. "Christian Militia" is on the record player when Terry's body is found. Craven listens to "The Time of the Preacher" when he is in Emma's room in the first episode. It later emerges Jedburgh is familiar with the song and both he and Craven sing it on two occasions, the lyrics being significant.

==Background==
===Origins===
“I am writing this story about a detective who turns into a tree” was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what he was working on during the early nineteen-eighties.<ref name="Introduction">Kennedy Martin, ''Introduction''.</ref> Kennedy Martin had become frustrated that “at the BBC there was no political dimension to their drama whatsoever” but had chosen to write a political story anyway, not really believing it would ever get made.<ref name="Magnox" /> The election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] as [[President of the United States]] had brought about a major shift in the global political landscape and Kennedy Martin was motivated to write out of concern arising from such issues as the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common protests]], the [[Falklands War|Falklands conflict]], [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|unrest]] among the miners and, arising out of the escalation of the [[Cold War]], the fear that “born-again Christians and Cold War warriors appeared to be running the United States”.<ref name="Introduction" />

By 1981, Kennedy Martin had written the first draft of what would eventually become ''Edge of Darkness'' – at this stage it was called ''Magnox'' (a reference to the [[Magnox]] type of [[nuclear reactor]]) and was about [[trade union]] problems in the nuclear industry.<ref name="PixleyA_52">Pixley, ''Get It While It's Hot'', p. 52.</ref> The script was given to head of BBC Drama, [[Jonathan Powell]], who encouraged Kennedy Martin to continue its development.<ref name="PixleyA_53">Pixley, ''Get It While It's Hot'', p. 53.</ref> The script would go though many changes and revisions before reaching its final form.

A particular influence was the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on [[23 March]] [[1983]] announcing the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) which, using ground-based and space-based systems, proposed protecting the United States from attack by [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missiles]].<ref name="Magnox" /> One of the supporters of SDI was one-time US presidential candidate [[Lyndon LaRouche]], on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Fusion Corporation of Kansas owner Jerry Grogan.<ref name="Introduction" /> Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the culture of secrecy surrounding the UK's policy regarding nuclear power in light of the inquiry into the construction of the [[Sizewell B nuclear power station]] and the concerns about the safety record of the [[Sellafield]] nuclear power plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.<ref name="Introduction" /> 

The other major influence was the Gaia hypothesis, that the Earth is a single living system that self-regulates itself to maintain the optimum conditions for life, formulated by climate scientist James Lovelock and popularised in his 1979 book ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth''. Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew on the surface of the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life.<ref name="Magnox" />

Although Kennedy Martin's notion for the serial was influenced by real political events, he had for a long time railed against [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] in television drama – most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine ''Encore'', titled “Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television”, in which he sought “to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera”.<ref>Cooke, ''British Television Drama: A History'', p. 64</ref> ''Edge of Darkness'' producer Michael Wearing has noted that “there is a mystical dimension to Troy's imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic”.<ref name="Lavender_104">Lavender, ''Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin)'', p. 104.</ref> Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within the realm of the mystical and the mythic.<ref>Lavender, ''Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin)'', p. 112.</ref> Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day's interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma's ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh's ''The Real Camelot'' (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]], saw Craven as a modern day [[Green Man]] who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia.<ref name="Introduction" /> Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the [[Teutonic Knights]] who defended the borders of [[Eastern Europe]], opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the [[Knights Templar]] who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref name="Introduction" /> These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial's conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a [[sniper]] and would be transformed into a tree.<ref name="PixleyA_55" />

===Production===
By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put the serial into production and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”.<ref>Pixley, ''Get It While It's Hot'', p. 54.</ref> The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International.<ref name="Lavender_104" /> Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular to the notion that Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest.<ref>Pixley, ''Get It While It's Hot'', p. 54 - 55.</ref> Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't be able to make it work for the audience”,<ref name="Magnox" /> a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”.<ref name="Magnox" /> Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.<ref>Lavender, ''Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin)'', p. 113.</ref>

Shooting on ''Edge of Darkness'' began on [[9 July]] [[1984]]<ref name="PixleyA_56" /> and ran for five months until [[5 December]] [[1984]].<ref name="PixleyB_50">Pixley, ''Into The Shadows'', p. 50.</ref> Location filming took place in London (including the [[Barbican Arts Centre]], [[BBC Television Centre]] and the [[Hilton Hotel|Hilton]] International [[Kensington]]), Yorkshire (including the headquarters of the West Yorkshire Police in [[Bradford]] and at Westwood Cottage, [[Ilkley]] for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's [[Reykjavik Summit|Reykjavik policy]] was formulated<ref name="Inglis_55">Inglis, ''Citizenship and the Media'', p. 55.</ref>) and [[Wales]] (including [[Clogau Gold Mine]] and Manod, [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in [[Penygroes]]).<ref>Pixley, ''Into The Shadows'', ''passim''</ref> Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as ''Magnox''; the title ''Dark Forces'' was briefly considered before the serial was renamed ''Edge of Darkness'' in April 1985.<ref name="PixleyB_50" /> As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, “I think we knew when we were making it that it was a good piece of work”<ref>{{cite video | title = Bob Peck interviewed on Breakfast Time | medium = Edge of Darkness DVD Special Feature | publisher = [[BBC Worldwide]] | location = London }}</ref> while Kennedy Martin told reporters “I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works”.<ref name="PixleyB_50" />

==Broadcast and critical reception==
''Edge of Darkness'' was promoted on the cover of the listings magazine ''[[Radio Times]]'' and was broadcast on Monday nights on BBC2 at 9:30pm, beginning [[4 November]] [[1985]].<ref name="PixleyB_51">Pixley, ''Into The Shadows'', p. 51.</ref> The serial averaged an audience of 4 million viewers over its run.<ref name="Cooke_147">Cooke, ''British Television Drama: A History'', p. 147.</ref> The critical response was generally positive with most commentators concentrating their praise on Peck's performance as Craven and the scale of the programme's political themes.<ref name="Lavender_104" /> “A good television thriller is very hard to find but ''Edge of Darkness'' promises to be one of the best”, wrote Celia Brayfield in ''[[The Times]]'', “The central character is played by Bob Peck, who has the gift of looking tragic and intelligent simultaneously. [...] There was humour to lift the gloom and superb characterisation to flesh out the stock situation”.<ref>{{cite news | first = Celia | last = Brayfield | title = Television: Thrilling promising pedigree | work = The Times | publisher = News Corp. | date = 1985-11-05 }}</ref>  Ruth Baumgarten, in ''[[The Listener]]'', praised the serial as “a grandiosely ambitious and compelling piece of fiction”.<ref name="PixleyB_51">Pixley, ''Into The Shadows'', p. 51.</ref> Speaking on the BBC's review programme ''Did You See..?'', the writer [[Sarah Dunant]] said, “this is a very classy piece of television drama, on all levels, I think on the plot level, I think on the level of emotion and I think stylistically [...] it looks absolutely wonderful, it's shot like a feature film”.<ref>{{cite video | title = Did You See..? | medium = Edge of Darkness DVD Special Feature | publisher = [[BBC Worldwide]] | location = London }}</ref> Not so impressed was Byron Rogers, television critic of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', who initially hailed the series as one that “stayed in the mind and will stay there long [...] because of its portrayal of human grief”<ref>{{cite news | first = Byron | last = Rogers | title = TV Review: They've got you surrounded | work = The Sunday Times | publisher = News Corp. | date = 1985-11-10 }}</ref> but later felt he was “beginning to find ''Edge of Darkness'' slightly irritating”<ref>{{cite news | first = Byron | last = Rogers | title = TV Review: The camera digs it's claws in | work = The Sunday Times | publisher = News Corp. | date = 1985-12-01 }}</ref> and decried the final episode as “an insult to its considerable following”.<ref>{{cite news | first = Byron | last = Rogers | title = TV Review: Beasts at the last supper | work = The Sunday Times | publisher = News Corp. | date = 1985-12-15 }}</ref>

Aware of the critical buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, [[Michael Grade]], quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it”, and so ''Edge of Darkness'' was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between [[19 December]] and [[21 December]] [[1985]], the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history.<ref name="PixleyB_52">Pixley, ''Into The Shadows'', p. 52.</ref> These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]].<ref name="PixleyB_52" /> It was a move that paid off – ''Edge of Darkness'' doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.<ref name="Cooke_147" />

==Cultural significance==
''Edge of Darkness'' tapped into a cultural [[zeitgeist]] of concern about nuclear power and nuclear warfare in the early to mid nineteen-eighties. In 1980, current affairs programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' broadcast “If The Bomb Drops”, a documentary that examined how well prepared Britain was for a nuclear attack; in 1983, ''[[The Day After]]'' an American TV movie about a nuclear war aired; in 1984, the BBC broadcast ''On the Eighth Day'', a documentary about the effects of a [[nuclear winter]] and ''[[Threads]]'', a drama about a nuclear attack on [[Sheffield]] while 1985 saw the first screening of [[Peter Watkins]]' nuclear war television film ''[[The War Game]]'', banned on television since 1965.<ref>Kibble-White, ''Let's All Hide In The Linen Cupboard''.</ref> ''Edge of Darkness'' also rode on a wave of preoccupation with the secretive nature of the State in both fact (e.g. ''[[This Week]]''’s “[[Death on the Rock]]” (1986) about the deaths of three [[Provisional IRA]] members in [[Gibraltar]] and ''Secret Society'' (1987) about undisclosed matters of public interest which led to the [[Zircon affair|sacking]] of [[Director General of the BBC|BBC Director General]] [[Alasdair Milne]]) and fiction (e.g. the films ''[[Defence of the Realm]]'' (1985) and ''The Whistle Blower'' (1987) and the television serials ''[[A Very British Coup]]'' (1988) and ''[[Traffik]]'' (1989)).<ref>Lavender, ''Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin)'', p. 107.</ref>

''Edge of Darkness'' continues to be well regarded to this day. When it was repeated on BBC2 in 1992, Sean Day-Lewis wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', “''Edge of Darkness'' is a masterpiece. It is one of those very rare television creations so rich in form and content that the spectator wishes there was some way of prolonging it indefinitely”.<ref>Lavender, ''Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin)'', p. 103 - 104.</ref> Andrew Lavender, writing in ''British Television Drama in the 1980s'', has said that ''Edge of Darkness'' “captured the spirit of its age but went far beyond the drama of its time. [...] It pushed against expectations attaching to the thriller form, often transcending the limits of the genre”.<ref>Lavender, ''Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin)'', p. 103.</ref> Fred Inglis, in his analysis of the serial in ''Formations: 20th Century Media Studies'', takes it “as one of the most remarkable works of art made for British television”.<ref name="Inglis_55" /> According to Lez Cooke, in ''British Television Drama: A History'', “In a reactionary climate, when the possibilities for the production of 'social issue' drama were limited, ''Edge of Darkness'' proved that, by adapting to changed circumstances and adopting a serialised thriller format, it was still possible to produce ambitious and progressive television drama in Britain in the mid-1980s”,<ref>Cooke, ''British Television Drama: A History'', p. 148.</ref> a view echoed by Sean Cubit in ''EcoMedia'' who notes that “the series neatly echoed the chill that descended on radical politics in the Thatcher years in the United Kingdom”.<ref>Cubitt, ''Edge of Darkness: eco-terrorism and the public sphere'', p. 79.</ref> The television historian Andrew Pixley has described the series as “possibly the finest BBC drama ever made”<ref name="PixleyA_52" /> and “one of the few television programmes where every element can be said to have worked to complete effect”.<ref>Pixley, ''Into The Shadows'', p. 53.</ref>

''Edge of Darkness'' was placed fifteenth (fourth position out of the dramas featured on the list) on the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] in 2000,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php |title = The BFI TV 100: 1-100 |accessdate = 2007-04-06 |year = 2000 |work = British Film Institute }}</ref> the BFI describing it as “a gripping, innovative six-part drama which fully deserves its cult status and many awards.”.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/prog.php?id=15 |title = 15: Edge of Darkness |accessdate = 2007-04-06 |last = Taylor |first = Veronica |work = British Film Institute }}</ref> ''Radio Times'' television editor Alison Graham listed it as one of the forty greatest television programmes ever made in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3184529.stm |title = Soaps join TV classics list |accessdate = 2007-04-06 |date = 2003-08-27|work = BBC News }}</ref> It was one of only seven dramas listed in ''[[Broadcast magazine|Broadcast]]'' magazine's list of the fifty most influential television programmes, published in July 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3919275.stm |title = TV shows make 'influential' list |accessdate = 2007-04-06 |date = 2004-07-23|work = BBC News }}</ref> In March 2007, ''Edge of Darkness'' was placed third in [[Channel 4]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest / 100 Worst|Greatest TV Dramas]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/03/the_50_greatest_tv_dramas.php | title = The 50 greatest TV dramas | accessdate = 2007-05-01 | last = Mathewman | first = Scott | date = 2007-03-07 | work = [[The Stage]] }}</ref> Also on Channel 4, Darius Jedburgh was listed eighty-fourth in their list of the One Hundred Greatest TV Characters in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html   |title = The One Hundred...
