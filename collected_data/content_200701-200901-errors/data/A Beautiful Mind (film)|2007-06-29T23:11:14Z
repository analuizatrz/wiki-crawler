'''''A Beautiful Mind''''' is an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[film]] inspired by the [[Nobel Laureate]] ([[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Economics]]) [[mathematician]] [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] and his experiences of [[schizophrenia]]. The film is loosely based on the more factual [[biography]] of [[A Beautiful Mind (book)|the same name]], which was written by [[Sylvia Nasar]] and published in [[1998]].

==Plot==

At the beginning of the film, John Nash arrives as a new graduate student at [[Princeton University]]. He is a recipient of the prestigious [[Carnegie Prize]] for [[mathematics]]. He meets his [[roommate]] Charles, a literature student, who soon becomes his best friend. He also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Martin Hansen, Sol, and Bender, with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. 	 
		 
The first part of the film establishes Nash's intellectual stamina and his propensity to be too outspoken in his social life. He admits that he is better with numbers than people, saying, "I don't like them much, and they don't much like me." He sometimes goes out to a bar with his fellow students to try to meet women, but is always unsuccessful. However, the experience is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of [[governing dynamics]], a theory in [[mathematical economics]]. 		 
After the conclusion of Nash's studies as a student at Princeton, he accepts a prestigious appointment at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), along with his friends Sol and Bender. It is while at this post that he meets Alicia, a student with whom he falls in love and eventually marries. 	 
While at Princeton, Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles's young niece Marcee. He also encounters a mysterious [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] agent, William Parcher. Nash is invited to a [[United States Department of Defense]] facility ([[The Pentagon]]) to [[cryptanalysis|crack]] a complex [[encryption]] of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally. Parcher observes Nash's performance from above, while partially concealed behind a screen. (His general appearance and behaviour is similar to that of the [[men in black]], though Nash addresses him as [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]].) Parcher later encourages Nash to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers, ostensibly to thwart a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] plot. After a harrowing chase scene and exchange of gunfire, Nash becomes increasingly [[Paranoia|paranoid]] and begins to behave erratically.
[[Image:A-beautiful-mind-3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Russell Crowe as John Nash]] 
After observing this erratic behavior, Sol follows Nash during one of his late night drop-offs of "top secret Soviet codes". Sol sees Nash place the documents into a drop-box at a long empty building, and reports this behaviour to Nash's superiors. He sees that he is being watched during a lecture.  Caught trying to flee, he is forcibly sedated and sent to a [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric facility]]. Initially, Nash's internment seemed like confirmation of his belief that the Soviets were trying to extract information from him, and that being taken by the officials of that psychiatric facility was a kidnapping by Soviet agents. 	 
 		 
Alicia, desperate to help her husband, visits the drop-box and retrieves the never-opened "top secret" documents that Nash delivered there. When confronted with this evidence, Nash is finally convinced that he has been [[Hallucination|hallucinating]]. The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash's secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a [[delusion]]. Even more surprisingly, Nash's friend Charles and his niece Marcee are also only products of Nash's mind. 	 
		 
After a painful series of [[insulin shock therapy]] sessions, Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take [[antipsychotic]] medication. However, these drugs create [[Adverse drug reaction|negative side-effects]] that affect his relationship with his wife and, most dramatically, his intellect. Frustrated, Nash secretly stops taking his medication, triggering a relapse of his psychosis. While bathing his infant son, Nash becomes distracted and wanders off. Alicia barely manages to save their child from being drowned. When she confronts Nash, he claims that his (hallucinatory) friend Charles was watching their son. Charles, Marcee, and Parcher all appear to John and urge him to kill his wife rather than allow her to lock him up again. Nash finally realizes that these people are products of his own mind when he observes that Marcee is the same age that she was when he first met her several years before. Only then does he accept that all three of these people are, in fact, part of his psychosis. 	 
 		 
Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the antipsychotic drugs and his delusions, Nash and his wife decide to try to live with his [[schizophrenia]]. Nash attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed "his demons". The rest of the movie depicts Nash growing older while working on his studies in the library of [[Princeton University]]. He still suffers hallucinations and periodically has to check if new people he meets are real, mentions taking newer medications, but is ultimately able to live with and largely ignore his psychotic experiences. Nash approaches his old friend and intellectual rival Martin Hansen, now head of the Princeton mathematics department, and receives permission to begin teaching again. He is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] for his revolutionary work on [[game theory]]. The final scene in the movie shows Nash and Alicia about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm, when John sees Charles, Marcee and Parcher standing and smiling. Alicia asks John what's wrong and John replies: Nothing. They walk out of the auditorium.

**John Nash spent 15 minutes deciding whether to drink tea or coffee when he met with Russell Crowe. The movie scene is a version of that meeting

==Relation to fact==
The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of Nash's life and schizophrenia as well as for the over-simplified representation of the [[Nash equilibrium]]. (The bar room game described in the movie was not a Nash equilibrium.) The [[PBS]] documentary ''A Brilliant Madness'' attempts to portray his life more accurately.

The film's major departures from Nash's life and the Nasar biography include:

* Little mention of Nash's numerous mathematical theorems, the originality and difficulty of which makes him one of the best pure mathematicians of the 20th century. However Nash's work on manifold embedding, which must rank among his most characteristic work, is referred to in at least one scene.
* No mention of Nash's sexual adventures at [[RAND]], nor his second family in Boston—although his son from Boston plays a part in the movie, as a nurse who manhandles Nash in the hospital.
* Nash is shown to join Wheeler's lab at MIT, but there is no such lab. He was appointed as [[C.L.E. Moore Instructor]] at MIT.
* His preservation at Princeton is shown as exclusively the work of professors in the Mathematics department while in fact administrators, especially at Firestone Library and the Information Centers in later years, also played a role. They are portrayed as one library clerk who didn't get interoffice mail.
* Nash's hallucinations were exclusively auditory,[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_06.html] and not both visual and auditory as shown in the film. It is true that his handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers.
* The film has Nash saying around the time of his Nobel prize in 1994: "I take the newer medications", when in fact Nash didn't take any medication from 1970 onwards, something Nash's biography highlights.
* A deleted scene from ''A Beautiful Mind'' reveals that Nash independently invented the board game [[Hex (board game)|Hex]].

==Music==
*[[James Horner]] composed the Oscar-nominated score.
