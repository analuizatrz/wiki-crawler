'''Santa Clara''' is the capital city of the [[Cuba]]n province of [[Villa Clara Province|Villa Clara]]. It is located in the most central region of the province and almost in the most central region of the country.

Santa Clara was founded by 175 persons on July 15th, 1689 from which 138 of them were represented by two large families living already in the area and, therefore, owners of the land of the next to to be city. The other 37 came from 7 other families, a priest and a governor, all of them originating from the coastal city of “San Juan de los Remedios”. The population of Remedios was torn between the option of leaving their city, constantly besieged by pirate attacks, or staying in place. While most of them finally decided to stay, these 37 persons traveled south and, on June 1st, 1689 they arrive to the hill where they rejoined the other two existing families. A mass was given under a Tamarind tree and the city was born. Since then, the place under the tree is known as “Loma Del Carmen” (Carmen’s Hill). A second generation church exists in a beautiful park along the place with a monument commemorating the event surrounded by a fourth generation Tamarind tree. 

Construction of the city began not far from Carmen’s Hill. Following the Spanish standards, a perfect squared layout with a central plaza (Plaza Mayor today Parque Vidal) was developed. The first buildings erected were the Cabildo (City Council) and a modest palm tree church. This building was enhanced in 1725 to a brick one, and stayed the center of the Parque Vidal until August 22, 1923 when it was torn down in order to expand the plaza and build a new church close by. Back then, and still nowadays, this decision, taken by the mayor, was highly criticized. The building, while not a gem of architecture, was not entirely unpleasant to the eye and certainly an example of the older colonial structure in the city. Resulting from this expropriation by the City Council, a complaint was raised by religious figures and a total of 77 850.00 pesos were paid in fines to the Church, a considerable sum that would represent millions of pesos today.

Soon after the foundation, a theater, a chamber of commerce, meeting clubs, public libraries and dance halls were erected as well. The position of the city, almost in the very center of the country, made it as a perfect halt and a great communication link, east-west and north-south, creating a slow but unstoppable growth. By the 19th century, Santa Clara was bigger and more populated than the rest of the towns around, including what was once Remedios. As a necessary stop between Havana and the east of the country, the city gained the title of Las Villas province capital.

'''The city of Marta and Che.'''

Two important figures have long honored the grounds of the city; Marta Abreu de Estevez and Ernesto Che Guevara. Marta is known as the “Benefactor of the city”, due to all the projects she and her family were involved in by donating money in order to make it a more pleasant place. It’s also known they sympathized with the insurgents and participated, in one way or another, in the war against Spain for the independence of Cuba. 

Marta’s legacy can be admired all over the city; an electric plant building, several schools, an asylum, public laundry stations by the Belico river (two of them still exist, unfortunately in poor conditions), the fire station that can be seen just a block off the Plaza Vidal, the train station near Carmen’s Hill, but first and foremost the “La Caridad” (Charity) Theater. This one can be admired in one of the corners of the Plaza. Marta was the only person to give money and supervise the design and construction. We may say it is the reason the building is not as grandiose as Terrier Theater in Cienfuegos City. La Caridad Theater is one of the seven (7) Big Theaters of the Colony Era still standing, and one that offer an exquisite architecture and amazing interior.  Marta finally donated her own palace to the city; it was used as a Provincial Government Palace and transformed into a Public Library afterwards. Today “Biblioteca Marti” (Marti Library), also located on the Plaza Vidal, is a beautiful example of Neo Classical architecture with finely decorated interiors. Santa Clara’s University is named after her.

Santa Clara was the site of the last battle in the [[Cuban Revolution]] in late [[1958]]. There were two guerrilla columns that attacked the city, one led by [[Che Guevara|Ernesto Che Guevara]] and the other led by [[Camilo Cienfuegos]].  Guevara's column first captured the garrison at Fomento. Then, using a bulldozer, Guevara's soldiers destroyed railroad tracks and derailed a train full of troops and supplies sent by [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]. At the same time, Cienfuegos's column defeated an army garrison at the [[Battle of Yaguajay]] not far from town. On [[December 31]], [[1958]], the combined forces of Guevara and Cienfuegos (along with other revolutionaries under [[William Alexander Morgan]]) attacked Santa Clara. The battle was chaotic, the defenders were demoralized, some fought, others surrendered without a shot. By the afternoon, the city was captured. This victory for Castro's troops is seen as the decisive moment in the Cuban Revolution as Batista fled Cuba less than 12 hours later.

Parque Vidal, Santa Clara is probably one of the most traditional places in Cuba. During the afternoons, people (specially singles) visit the park to meet others. Although not widely practiced in recent times, the custom was to walk the park around and around. The women walk the inner part of the park, while the men walk the outer side. Another lost custom was for the locals to set up a platform and offer improvisations with their guitars on late Sunday afternoons. For that day they dressed with their [[Guayaberas]] and highly polished shoes.

Prior to [[1 January]] [[1977]], Santa Clara was located in [[Las Villas Province]]. On that date, as part of a general administrating reordering of Cuba's provinces, Las Villas province was reordered into the provinces of [[Villa Clara Province|Villa Clara]], [[Cienfuegos Province|Cienfuegos]], and [[Sancti Spíritus Province|Sancti Spíritus]]. Santa Clara is in the province now known as Villa Clara.
