'''Edgerton L. "Bubba" Henry''' (born [[February]] [[1936]]) is a [[Baton Rouge]] attorney, [[lobbyist]], and partner of the high-powered firm Adams and Reese who served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[Louisiana]] House of Representatives from [[1968]]-[[1980]]. He was [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] from [[1972]]-[[1980]]. Henry was [[Governor]] [[Edwin Washington Edwards]]'s choice for Speaker. Though he was considered reform-minded, some [[conservative]]s still questioned Henry's commitment to reform. In [[1979]], Henry finished in a weak fifth place in the [[jungle primary]] in his bid to succeed Edwards as governor. Thereafter, he was commissioner of administration for the new governor, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[David C. Treen]], then of [[Jefferson Parish]]. After Treen left office, Henry retired from elective and appointive office to concentrate on his law practice and lobbying activities. He joined Adams and Reese in [[1987]]. One of his major clients is [[State Farm Insurance]].

==Leading the "Young Turks"==

Henry graduated from Jonesboro-Hodge High School and obtained his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Baylor University]] in [[Waco, Texas]], in [[1957]]. Thereafter, he obtained his [[law]] degree from [[Louisiana State University]] in Baton Rouge. In his first term in the legislature, the 32-year-old Henry led a group of younger members who advocated reforms. Called the "Young Turks," the members urged cuts in spending, decreasing the number of state employees, and reducing the amount of bonded indebtedness. Henry stopped the lobbyists from going onto the House floor, and he opened up the committee process, but overall the priorities of the legislature are usually tied to those of the institutionally "strong" governor.

In addition to Henry, the "Young Turks" included then Representative [[Robert G. "Bob" Jones]] of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], son of former Governor [[Sam Jones|Sam Houston Jones]]. Jones would later become a state senator and ran unsuccessfully for governor in [[1975]]. Other "Young Turks" from around the state who participated in this session were the late [[John Hainkel|John Hainkel, Jr.]], of New Orleans, [[P.J. Mills]] of [[Shreveport]], Thomas Casey of New Orleans, R.W. "Buzzy" Graham of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], [[Don W. Williamson|Donald Wayne "Don" Williamson]] of [[Vivian, Louisiana|Vivian]] in north [[Caddo Parish]], and [[Ben Bagert]] of New Orleans.

==Henry' biggest legislative defeat==

Henry's most conspicuous defeat as Speaker of the House occurred in 1976, when the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] was rejected by the House Civil Law Committee. At the national level, 35 of the required 38 states had ratified ERA, and its feminist advocates targeted Louisiana, [[Florida]], and [[Illinois]] as the final three hurdles to overcome. Pro-family groups throughout the country fought ERA on the premise that it would federalize family law and preempt the states in areas dealing with the family. 

Henry had placed what he believed was a majority of ERA backers on the Civil Law Committee. One of those was his future law partner with Adams and Reese in Baton Rouge, Sam LeBlanc, III, a [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] ([[Jefferson Parish]]) Democrat. LeBlanc, who served in the legislature from 1972-1980, was in fact the committee chairman. Previously, the committee had given ERA an "unfavorable" report, which had rendered it nearly impossible for the measure to be passed on the House floor. There were believed to have been nine ERA backers on the committee, based either on their past votes in the previous legislative session or on how the lawmaker had stood on ERA in the 1975 election campaign. There were only five ERA opponents on the panel, including [[Dan Richey|Daniel Wesley "Dan" Richey]], then a young [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]] ([[Concordia Parish]]) Democrat, but later a Republican political activist in Baton Rouge. Supporters expected ERA would receive a "fair" hearing and a "favorable" report to the full House.

ERA generated nearly as much attention from legislators as the simultaneous consideration of the successful [[right-to-work]] law. Feminists seemed to think that it was a foregone conclusion that Speaker Henry had found a way to get the amendment out of the previously "obstructionist" committee. Meanwhile, a small group of social conservatives, unknown to Henry, LeBlanc, or the feminists, was giving speeches in parts of the state where they sought to switch the votes of four Democratic representatives on the committee. These lawmakers were [[Jock Scott|John W. "Jock" Scott]] of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], [[Michael F. "Mike" Thompson]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Lane Carson|Lane A. Carson]] of [[New Orleans]], and [[A. J. McNamara]] of Metairie. It was believed that the [[Pentecostal Church]], which opposed ERA and which was influential in [[Rapides Parish]], convinced Scott to reverse his position. Right-to-lifers and pro-family groups in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and New Orleans, persuaded Thompson to oppose the ERA, and conservative women in Jefferson Parish pleaded with McNamara, later a [[Ronald W. Reagan]]-appointed U.S. district judge, to switch his vote as well.

The defections by the lawmakers, all of whom eventually became Republicans, was one of the best kept secrets in the Louisiana Capitol in many years. Speaker Henry designated the House chamber as the committee room to accommodate the women who had come to Baton Rouge for the historic vote. The feminists received special seating preferences in the House balcony and packed the proceedings. Opponents of ERA were secretly smiling, however.

Dan Richey recalled the scene:

"As the roll was called (in alphabetical order), there was a slight amount of muttering from the balcony when Lane Carson stated 'No'. The feminists weren't really shaken, because they knew the outcome would be 8-6. No problem.  Tensions flared when the next defector, Buddy McNamara, in his deep voice, stated 'Nooo'.  For the feminist vote counters, it was still okay -- the projected 7-7 tie would be broken by [Chairman] Sam LeBlanc, Henry's hand-picked ERA deliverer.  Then, back-to-back, the 'No' votes of Jock Scott and Mike Thompson provided pandemonium from the small contingent of pro-family forces placed sparingly in the back of the House chamber; while obscenities could be heard from the balcony from the previously prim and proper proponents.  ERA was put out of its misery.

"The projected 9-5 margin of victory was instead a 5-9 defeat.  How sweet it was.  There is a saying in politics that came to mind then -- 'When you win, you can afford to be gracious.'  On the day ERA was defeated, you can rest assured that I was very, very gracious."

==Gubernatorial politics==

Henry represented District 13, which included his native [[Jonesboro, Louisiana|Jonesboro]], seat of [[Jackson Parish]], also the birthplace and burial site of former Governor [[Jimmie Davis|James Houston "Jimmie" Davis]]. In 1972, Henry campaigned for Edwin Edwards, who faced an unusually strong Republican gubernatorial opponent in David Treen. Jackson Parish reelected Henry to the legislature, but it supported Treen for governor in the general election held on February 1 that year. 

In 1979, after he had lost out in the primary, Henry endorsed Republican Treen, but Jackson Parish again defied Henry's suggestion and voted for Treen's Democratic gubernatorial challenger, [[Louis Lambert|Louis J. Lambert, Jr.]], a public service commissioner from [[Ascension Parish]].

In his 1979 gubernatorial run, Henry received 135,769 votes (9.9 percent). His manager was a future governor: [[Buddy Roemer|Charles E. "Buddy" Roemer, III]] of [[Bossier Parish]]. Henry and Roemer had become friends when both were members of the Lousiana Constitutional Convention of [[1973]]. Henry was a chairman of the convention and was highly regarded for his ability to bring about consensus on divisive issues. 

==Commissioner of Administration==

In [[1980]], as his legislative term ended, Henry became Treen's commissioner of administration, a high position in state government, which had been filled under Edwards by none other than Roemer's often controversial father, Charles E. Roemer, II, also of Bossier Parish. As commissioner of administration, Henry pushed to fruition the plans and blueprints for the State Capitol Complex and the consolidation of state offices within the Capitol environs.

==Henry's legacy==

Henry's affiliations include the Council for a Better Louisiana, the Public Affairs Research Council, and the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank.

In [[1974]], Henry was honored in the [[Oval Office]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], by President [[Gerald R. Ford, Jr.]], who cited his  "exemplary leadership," particularly in reference to his chairmanship of the constitutional convention.

In the fall of [[2001]], ''Louisiana Life'' magazine named Henry one of 20 persons who have "most influenced public policy in Louisiana during the past 20 years." And that designation came after his tenure in the legislature had ended.

In [[2003]], he lent support to an unsuccessful effort by a group attempting to convince President [[George W. Bush]] to release Edwin Edwards from prison. "He has been ruined. There is no purpose to be served by his sitting in prison for 10 years," said the former Louisiana Speaker. Edwards was convicted in May [[2000]] on [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[racketeering]], and [[money-laundering]] charges following a four-month trial.

Henry and his wife, Frances T. Henry (born [[1937]]), attend the University [[Baptist Church]] in Baton Rouge, where Henry has taught the young adults Sunday school class for many years. On the occasion of Henry's 70th birthday in [[2006]], the state House expressed "enduring gratitude" for his "outstanding contributions to the state." The House resolution also said that Henry "lives his life based on his faith in his Creator." Mrs. Henry is a member of the Louisiana State Board of Regents.
