'''Cockroaches''' (or simply "roaches") are [[insect]]s of the order '''blattodea'''. This name derives from the [[Latin]] word for "cockroach", ''blatta''. The [[folk etymology]] of the English word ''cockroach'' is the Spanish ''cucaracha''.

Cockroaches exist worldwide, with the exception of polar regions. There are roughly 4,500 species in six families.

Among the most well-known species are the [[American cockroach]], ''Periplaneta americana'', which is about 3&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] long, the [[German cockroach]], ''Blattella germanica'', about 1½&nbsp;cm long, the [[Asian cockroach]], ''Blattella asahinai'', also about 1½ cm in length, and the [[Oriental cockroach]], ''Blatta orientalis'', about 2½ cm.  [[Tropics|Tropical]] cockroaches are often much bigger, and extinct cockroach relatives such as the [[Carboniferous]] ''[[Archimylacris]]'' and the [[Permian]] ''[[Apthoroblattina]]'' were several times as large as these. Cockroaches are often considered [[pest (animal)|pest]]s, infesting urban habitats. Of thousands of species, about 30 (less than 1%) do so.

==Evolutionary history and relationships==
The earliest cockroach-like fossils are from the [[Carboniferous]] period between 354&ndash;295 million years ago. However, these fossils differ from modern cockroaches in having long [[ovipositor]]s and are the ancestors of [[mantid]]s as well as modern cockroaches. The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appear in the early [[Cretaceous]].

[[Mantodea]], [[Isoptera]], and Blattodea are usually combined by [[entomologists]] into a higher group called [[Dictyoptera]]. Current evidence strongly suggests that [[termite]]s have evolved directly from true cockroaches. If this is the case, then Blattodea excluding Isoptera is not a [[monophyletic]] group and the Isoptera are actually a family (or epifamily) of cockroaches. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6553219.stm]<!-- Phylogeny predicted by Deitz in 2003: http://globiz.sachsen.de/snsd/publikationen/ArthropodSystematicsPhylogeny/EA_61_1/EA_61_1-69-91_Deitz.pdf -->. 

==Biology==
Cockroaches are generally [[omnivorous|omnivores]]. An exception to this is the [[wood]]-eating ''[[Cryptocercus]]'' species found in Russia, China, Korea and the United States. Although they are incapable of digesting the [[cellulose]] themselves, they have a symbiotic relationship with a [[protozoa]]n that digests the cellulose, allowing them to extract the nutrients. In this, they are similar to termites and current research suggests that the genus ''Cryptocercus'' is more closely related to [[termite]]s than it is to other cockroaches. Cockroaches are most common in tropical and [[subtropical]] climates. Some species are in close association with human dwellings and widely found around garbage or in the kitchen. 

Cockroaches, like all insects, breathe through a system of tubes called [[tracheae]]. The tracheae of insects are attached to the [[spiracle]]s, excluding the head.  Thus the cockroach can breathe without its head.  The valves open when the [[CO2]] level in the insect rises to an unacceptable level; then the CO2 [[Diffusion|diffuses]] out of the tracheae to the outside and fresh [[oxygen]] diffuses in. The tracheal system brings the air directly to [[cell]]s because they branch continually like a tree until their finest divisions tracheoles are associated with each cell allowing gaseous oxygen to dissolve in the cytoplasm lying across the fine cuticle lining of the tracheole. CO2 diffuses out of the cell into the tracheole.

Most insects do not have muscular lungs and thus do not actively breathe in the vertebrate lung manner. However, in some very large insects the diffusion process may not be sufficient to provide oxygen at the necessary rate and body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air out and in the spiracles and one can actually call this breathing. This might be associated with such activities as the energetic flight of the migratory locust. [http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/cockroach_faq.html#Q21]

Consequently, cockroaches can survive decapitation for a very long period compared with humans, but of course become unable to fend for themselves and eventually die.<ref name='Sci-Am 2007-03-15'> {{cite journal|title=Fact or Fiction?: A Cockroach Can Live without Its Head|journal=Scientific American|date=2007-03-15|first=Charles|last=Choi|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=5244F57C-E7F2-99DF-3E40BA295C3DCC0A&sc=I100322|format=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

[[Image:Blatella germanica cdc.jpg|thumb|Female ''[[Blatella germanica]]'' with ootheca]]
Female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomen; the egg case of the German cockroach holds about 30&ndash;40 long, thin eggs, packed like frankfurters in the case called an [[ootheca]]. The eggs hatch from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air and are initially bright white [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] that continue inflating themselves with air and harden and darken within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while [[ecdysis|molting]] has led to many individuals to claim to have seen albino cockroaches.

[[Image:Snodgrass common household roaches.png|thumb|left|'''Common household roaches''' A. [[German cockroach]], B. [[American cockroach]], C. [[Australian cockroach]], D&E. [[Oriental cockroach]] (♀ & ♂)]]
A female German cockroach carries an egg capsule containing around 40 eggs. She drops the capsule prior to hatching. Development from eggs to adults takes 3-4 months. Cockroaches live up to a year. The female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, it can produce 300-400 offspring. Other species of cockroach, however, can produce an extremely high number of eggs in a lifetime. Laying up to 100 eggs in each egg sac, it only needs to be impregnated once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of its life.

The world's largest cockroach is the Australian [[giant burrowing cockroach]], which can grow to 9&nbsp;cm in length and weigh more than 30&nbsp;[[gram]]s. Comparable in size is the giant cockroach ''[[Blaberus giganteus]]'', which grows to a similar length but is not as heavy.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A peculiar exception is the [[Oriental cockroach]], which is attracted to light. 

The cockroach is also one of the hardiest insects on the planet, capable of living for a month without food; being able to survive even on the glue from the back of postage stamps.<ref name='M & V E'>{{cite book|last=Mullen|first=Gary

It is popularly suggested that cockroaches will "inherit the earth" if humanity destroys itself in a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal dose perhaps 6 to 15 times that for humans. However, they are not exceptionally radiation-resistant compared to other insects, such as the fruit fly&nbsp;.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1567313.htm|title=Cockroaches & Radiation |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The cockroach's ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained in terms of the cell cycle. Cells are more vulnerable to effects of radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once when in its molting cycle, which at most happens weekly. The cells of the cockroach take roughly 48 hours to complete a molting cycle, which would give time enough for radiation to affect it but not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time. This would mean some would be unaffected by the initial radiation and thus survive, at least until the fallout arrived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/cockroach_faq.html#Q5 |title=Are cockroaches resistant to radation? |author =Joseph G.

==Behavior==
Cockroaches have been shown to exhibit [[Emergence#Emergent properties .26 processes|emergent behaviour]].<ref name="viegas">{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |title=Cockroaches Make Group Decisions |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |author=Jennifer Viegas |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Research being conducted at the [[University of Florida]] shows that cockroaches leave chemical trails in their feces. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. One of the major implications of this research is a new technique in cockroach pest control. Cockroaches could potentially be removed from a home by leaving a chemical trail that leads away from the home.

Research has shown that group-based decision making is responsible for more complex behavior such as resource allocation.  A study where 50 cockroaches were placed in a dish with three shelters with a capacity for 40 insects in each, the insects arranged themselves in two shelters with 25 insects in each, leaving the third shelter empty.  When the capacity of the shelters was increased to more than 50 insects per shelter, all of the cockroaches arranged themselves in one shelter.  Researchers found a balance between cooperation and competition exists in group decision-making behavior found in cockroaches.  The models used in this research can also explain the group dynamics of other insects and animals.<ref name="viegas"/>

Additionally, researchers at [[Tohoku University]] engaged in a [[Classical Conditioning]] experiment with cockroaches and discovered that the insects were able to associate the scent of vanilla and peppermint with a sugar treat. <ref name="parry">{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/sep/pavlovian-cockroaches-learn-like-dogs-and-humans |title=Pavlovian Cockroaches Learn Like Dogs (and Humans) |publisher=[[Discover Magazine]] |author=Wynne Parry |accessmonthday=5 September |accessyear=2007}}</ref>

== Cockroaches and health risks ==
A 2005 US national study on factors that affect [[asthma]] in inner-city children shows that cockroach allergens appear to worsen asthma symptoms more than other known triggers.  This study, funded by the [[United States|US]] [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) and the US [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID), is the first large-scale study to rank asthma triggers according to severity.

Additionally, a 2005 research study, sponsored by the [[National Pest Management Association]] (NPMA), shows a disparity in homeowner knowledge about this link.  Only 10% of homeowners in the USA feel that cockroaches are a threat to their family's health.

==Habitat==
[[Image:Bush Cockroach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A bush cockroach]]
Cockroaches live in a wide range of environments around the world.  Pest species of cockroaches adapt readily to a variety of environments, but prefer warm conditions such as found within buildings.  Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments and do not fare well in the average household.  Only about 20 species of cockroaches out of the 3,500 are suited to thrive in the typical home.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

==Pest control==
[[Image:Roach control.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Cockroach control, with cockroach baits, boric acid, and hydramethylnon gel.]]
There are numerous parasites and predators of cockroaches, but few of them have proven to be highly effective for biological control. [[Wasps]] in the family [[Evaniidae]] are perhaps the most effective insect predators, as they attack the egg cases, and wasps in the family [[Ampulicidae]] are predators on adult and nymphal cockroaches (e.g., ''[[Ampulex compressa]]''). The [[house centipede]], however, is probably the most effective control agent of cockroaches, though most homeowners find the centipedes themselves objectionable.
Preventative measures include keeping all food stored away in sealed containers, using garbage cans with a tight lid, frequent cleaning in the kitchen, and regular vacuuming. Any water leaks, such as dripping taps, should also be repaired. It is also helpful to seal off any entry points, such as holes around baseboards, in between kitchen cabinets, pipes, doors, and windows with some steel wool or copper mesh and some cement, putty or silicone caulk. Once a cockroach infestation occurs, chemical controls may help alleviate the problem. Bait stations, gels containing [[hydramethylnon]] or [[fipronil]], as well as [[boric acid]] powder, are toxic to cockroaches.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population.  Additionally, pest control products containing [[deltamethrin]] are very effective.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Lowering the habitat temperature below freezing point may render most of the eggs infertile. This method may be practical in rural homes but it is highly unlikely to work in large cities.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

==Popular culture==
{{Trivia|date=July 2007}}
In popular culture, cockroaches are often regarded as vile and extremely resilient pests, due to their shiny [[exoskeleton]]s (making them look slimy, contrary to their fastidious habits), and their size, unusual for a scavenging insect. 

Movies which feature cockroaches include: 
*''[[Joe's Apartment]]'' &mdash; The bugs are cheerful, swinging party-goers who help the titular human hero.
*''[[Creepshow]]'' &mdash; Swarms of them terrorize a cantankerous and verminophobic old man.
*''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'' &mdash; A post-apocalyptic [[Salt Lake City]], Utah is infected with a four-inch long, flesh-eating mutant variety (played by the [[Madagascar Hissing Cockroach]]).
*''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' &mdash; A giant cockroach-like alien's actions threaten to lead to the destruction of the Earth.
*''[[Team America: World Police]]'' &mdash; After his apparent death, a cockroach crawls out of [[Kim Jong-il]]'s mouth and flies away in a rocket ship, in [[parody]] of ''Men in Black''.
*''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]] '' &mdash; Diseased cockroaches are the target of the genetically-altered titular species.
*''[[Twilight of the Cockroaches]]'' &mdash; An anime film in which roaches live peacefully in a bachelor's apartment until he begins dating a woman across the street, who encourages killing the insects.
* ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'', Debbie is working out when she falls asleep on the bench, giving Freddy full reign of turning her into a cockroach (her biggest fear), and being squished to death.

In [[Franz Kafka]]'s story ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', the character Gregor Samsa awakes to find himself transformed into a giant insect, often interpreted as a cockroach. Actually, the type of bug into which Gregor transforms is not specified, though it is referred to as "[[vermin]]" and the little physical description offered could match either a cockroach or beetle. Conversely, [[Tyler Knox]] published a noir comedy in 2006 called "Kockroach" (William Morrow) in which a cockroach wakes up one morning as a man and becomes a leading gangster in [[Times Square]] during the 1950s.

In the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode "[[War of the Coprophages]]", cockroaches are seen to group together to murder people. The character Dr. Berenbaum (based on the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] entomologist) suggests that it is actually swarms of flying cockroaches that are responsible for most [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] sightings (they generate an electro-static field which can be illuminated dependent on atmospheric conditions). In one of the scenes, a cockroach that escaped can be seen crawling over the camera, making it appear that the viewer's television has become infested. Though the shot was not planned, the producers decided to leave it in the episode.

In the television show ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', Alf inadvertently releases a [[Melmac (planet)|Melmacian]] cockroach in the house.  When it is sprayed with [[insecticide]], it grows bigger until it is large enough to eat him.  He discovers that a bottle of perfume will kill the cockroach.

The short-lived kids television show ''[[Freaky Stories]]'' was hosted by a cockroach named Larry.

In [[Revolt of the Cockroach People]], an autobiographical novel by [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], cockroaches are used as a metaphor for oppressed and downtrodden minorities in US society in the 1960s and 70s, particularly Mexican-Americans.  There are several references to the folk song [[La Cucaracha]] throughout the novel.

In Australian [[rugby league]], the [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales State of Origin Team]] are informally known as the Cockroaches, due to the commonality of the cockroach as a household pest in [[New South Wales|that state]]. Their opponents, the [[Queensland State of Origin Team]], are known as the [[Cane Toad]]s, after [[Queensland|that state]]'s most common pest.

In 1987, Los Angeles rapper [[Russ Parr|Bobby Jimmy]] released the song "Roaches" as a parody of [[Timex Social Club]]'s hit song "Rumors".  Its chorus line was ''Look at all these roaches / Around me everyday / Need somethin' strong / To make 'em go away''.

The cult computer game ''[[Bad Mojo]]'' deals with a person turned into a cockroach, in clear 
reference to Kafka's Metamorphosis.

Hardcore rapper [[Necro]] has a track called "Cockroaches" in which he raps about people's fear and/or dislike of cockroaches.

[[archy and mehitabel|Archy]] is a cockroach in a series of columns by [[Don Marquis]].

Along with rats, cockroaches are frequently seen infesting various locations in [[Steve Purcell]]'s [[comic book]] series ''[[Sam & Max]]'', and one storyline features a race of gigantic cockroaches living on the moon.

In the [[Discworld]] novel ''The Last Continent'', [[Ponder Stibbons]] is horrified to learn that the cockroach is actually the most highly evolved and advanced creature in the world, and not mankind as he had assumed.

A similar sentiment is expressed in beginning of the first episode of the TV series ''[[Heroes (tv series)|Heroes]]'', when Mohinder Suresh (a genetics professor) describes cockroaches, and not humans, as the pinnacle of evolution. The series' main antagonist, Sylar, is also associated with cockroaches in a couple of scenes.

In the movie [[Naked Lunch]], the main character, William Lee's "case worker" appears to him in the form of large cockroach that speaks through a hole in its abdomen. Later, this cockroach appears again as a hybrid of a cockroach/typewriter that has a keypad on its face. The case worker reveals his name as "Clark Nova", which also happens to be the name of Lee's typewriter model

They are referred to in the episode "Insect Inside" of [[The Powerpuff Girls]].

In the computer game [[Deadly Rooms of Death]] (DROD), cockroaches are considered as flesh-eating monsters, which infest dungeons of all kinds.

In Godzilla vs Gigan, both King Ghidorah and Gigan are controlled remotely by Nebulans, an alien race of giant cockroaches that inherited a waste planet after the dominant species on it polluted it into oblivion.

In the 1983 film [[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]], [[Tony Montana|Tony]] refers to Gasper Gomez and the Diaz Brothers, rival gang leaders to Frank Lopez, as cockroaches in one of the film's most famous lines: "I'll bury those cock-a-roaches."

[[Boxing]] coach [[Freddie Roach]] was nicknamed La Cucaracha (The Cockroach) when he was still competing as a fighter.

In the movie [[An American Tail]] the chief villain, Warren T. Rat, carries with him a cockroach named Digit who he forces to count his money and frequently abuses, even threatening to eat him at one point.

The album [[Infest]] from [[Papa Roach]] features a large roach on the cover. 
The [[Shuffle Demons]] did a song in 1986, ''Get Out Of My House, Roach'', on the album [[Streetniks]]. [[Sleepytime Gorilla Museum]]'s second studio album, [[Of Natural History]] features the song ''Cockroach,'' which describes cockroaches with disgust.

==History==
Some of the earliest writings with regards to cockroaches encourage their use as medicine. [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (''[[1st century]]''), [[Kamal al-Din al-Damiri]] and [[Abu Hanifa ad-Dainuri]] (''[[9th century]]'') all offered medicines that either suggest grinding them up with oil or boiling. The list of ailments included earaches, open wounds and "gynecological disorders."{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Miscellaneous==
*The largest by weight is a 33.5&nbsp;[[gram|g]] ''[[Macropanesthia rhinoceros]]''.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
*The smallest species is ''[[Attaphila fungicola]]'', reaching only 3&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]].
