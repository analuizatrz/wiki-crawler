The term '''Oregon Outback''' is generally used in reference to the [[high desert]] [[Basin and Range]] country of the southeastern corner of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. The area comprises [[Lake County, Oregon|Lake]], [[Harney County, Oregon|Harney]], and [[Malheur County, Oregon|Malheur]] Counties, and portions of eastern [[Klamath County, Oregon|Klamath County]]. Its area is roughly 25,000 square miles. The counties that compose this region are among the largest and least populous in the [[continental United States|contiguous United States]]. The region's major cities, [[Burns, Oregon|Burns]] and [[Lakeview, Oregon|Lakeview]], each have a population of about 3,000. 

==Climate==
It is an arid region with an average of about ten inches of annual rainfall, though some mountain areas may receive as much as thirty inches, mostly in the form of winter snow and summer thunderstorms. The [[Alvord Desert]], in the [[rainshadow]] of massive [[Steens Mountain]], is the driest spot in the northwest, averaging seven inches of precipitation a year. Winters are cold and windy with periodic snowfalls; spring brings warm days and cold nights with snow possible into late April. Summer is warm with cool nights and occasional thunderstorms, with fall bringing crisp weather that can be interrupted by snow as soon as late October.

==Topography==
The region is a high desert [[plateau]] averaging roughly 4,000 feet in elevation, periodically broken by sometimes massive [[fault-block mountain]]s. Steens Mountain in Harney county is the highest point in the region, with its fifty-mile-long scarp reaching 9,733 feet above sea level. The second highest peak in the region is [[Pueblo Mountain]] at 8,634 feet, rising about twenty miles south of the Steens.

Other notable fault blocks in the region are [[Abert Rim]], [[Winter Ridge]], [[Diablo Rim]], [[Fish Creek Rim]], [[Hart Mountain]], and [[Poker Jim Ridge]]. Large lakes abound throughout the region as the streams of the great basin have no outlet to the sea and empty themselves on the basin floor. The [[Warner Lakes]] are the largest cluster of these shallow basin lakes, with [[Malheur Lake|Malheur]] and [[Harney Lake|Harney]] lakes being the largest. The lakes contain fish, notably crappie in the Warner Lakes, and host numerous bird species, which are protected at Malheur Lake as part of the [[Malheur National Wildlife Refuge]], an important stopping ground on the [[Pacific Flyway]].

==Flora==


==Fauna==
[[Mule Deer]] are one of the most common large mammals encountered in the Outback. [[Pronghorn]] are also a common species; in fact, the herd protected on the [[Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge]] is one of the largest in North America. Another unique large mammal is the [[Kiger Mustang]]; these feral horses are direct descendents of Spanish Mustangs that escaped from the [[conquistador]]s long ago in the southwest.

==Rivers==
Most of the major rivers in the area are quite small, but they are important to the regional [[ecosystem]]s. The largest river is the [[National Wild and Scenic River|wild and scenic-designated]] [[Owyhee River]], which enters Oregon from [[Idaho]]. The [[Donner und Blitzen River]] drains the western slopes of Steens Mountain before emptying into Malheur Lake. The Blitzen provides important habitat to native [[redband trout]]. Other streams of note are the [[Silvies River]], [[Chewaucan River]], Deep Creek, and [[Malheur River]].

==Ownership==
Much of the area is publicly owned, primarily under [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) control. Some large areas are specially designated for protection, such as the [[Steens Mountain Wilderness]] complex, [[Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge]] and the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Though access to most areas is readily available because the land is publicly owned, use is relatively light because of the extreme isolation of the country. A recent controversy involves the grazing of domestic livestock on public lands. A century old practice, public grazing in many areas has recently led environmentalists to decry the practice as harmful to the fragile and unique desert ecosystems. In fact, this controversy led to the creation of the Steens Mountain Wilderness, which includes some of the only designated livestock free zones in the nation.
