'''Derry City Football Club''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: '''''An Cumann Peile Chathair Dhoire''''') are an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in the city of [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The club, however, play in the 12-teamed [[FAI Premier Division]], which is the top tier of the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland's]] national fooball league, the [[FAI League of Ireland]]. They are the only club in the league from Northern Ireland, as opposed to the Republic of Ireland. The club play their home matches at the [[Brandywell Stadium]]. Derry City's colours are red and white in a vertically striped pattern and they have been given the nickname, the ''Candystripes'', as a result. Others may refer to the club as the ''Red and White Army'', just ''Derry'', or simply, ''City''. 

The club, founded in 1928, formerly played in the [[Irish League]] - Northern Ireland's league - and won their only title there in the 1964&ndash;65. The club's period in the league came to an end in 1972 when they opted out after the [[Irish Football Association]], having earlier banned the use of their home-ground due to security fears over the effects of the Northern Irish [[Troubles]], which were ongoing at the time, in the Brandywell area and demanded that they play their games outside of the city of Derry and in [[Coleraine]], requested that they continue playing in Coleraine despite the unsustainability of the arrangement and the fact that security forces had ruled the area around the Brandywell to be safe enough to stage footballing events once again. After a period of almost 13 years without senior football, they applied to and were welcomed by the [[Football Association of Ireland]] into the newly-created First Division of the [[League of Ireland]] for the 1985&ndash;86 season. After winning the First Division title and achieving promotion to the Premier Division in 1987, the club have remained there since. The club went on to win a domestic [[The Treble|treble]] in the 1988&ndash;89 season and won the Premier Division again in 1996&ndash;97. Since entering the League of Ireland, Derry City have shared a local rivalry with [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] of [[Ballybofey]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and contest the [[Northwest Derby]] with them when the two clubs meet.

==History==
{{dablink|For further details on this topic, see: [[History of Derry City F.C.]]}}
Founded in 1928, Derry City decided against using the official title of the city - [[Derry-Londonderry name dispute|Londonderry]] - in their name. [[Irish nationalists|Nationalists]] generally refer to the city as 'Derry', while [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]] can be inclined to term it 'Londonderry'.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6213890.stm City name row lands in High Court]" ''[[BBC News]]'', [[2006-12-06]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref> At the time of the club's naming, however, the dispute would not have been as politicised as it is in the current day and those who founded the club specifically decided against using the name of the city's previous primary club, [[Derry Celtic F.C.|Derry Celtic]], with the aim of offering a more inclusive support-base to football fans in the city.<ref name=History>"[http://derrycityfc.net/history/concise/index.php Derry City FC - A Concise History]", ''CityWeb'', [[2006]].

The club's first significant success came in 1935 when they lifted the [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]].<ref>[http://www.derrycityfc.net/history/honours.php Derry City FC - Honours List], ''CityWeb''.

While up until the late 1960s most teams' journey to the [[Brandywell]] would have been of little consequence, 1969 was the year in which the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|Civil Rights]] campaign against the province's government disintegrated into communal violence, ushering in 30 years of the [[The Troubles|Troubles]].<ref name=Bradley>Bradley, Steve.

Because of the extreme disturbances, numerous clubs were reluctant to play matches there and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] ruled that the zone was unsafe. As a result, Derry City were forced to travel to the majority [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]] town of [[Coleraine]], which was over 30 miles away from home, in order to play their 'home' games at the [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|Showgrounds]]. This situation lasted until October 1972 when, faced with dwindling crowds (most Derry fans were unwilling to travel to Coleraine due to the political situation and the 40-minute journey) and dire finances, the club formally requested permission to return to the Brandywell. Despite an assessment by the security forces which concluded that the Brandywell was no more dangerous than any other ground in the league<ref name=Bradley/> and the resulting lifting of the imposed ban, City's proposal fell by a single vote at the hands of their fellow [[Irish League]] teams who remained unwilling to travel there. On Friday [[13 October]], 1972, the following day, Derry withdrew from senior football devastated and feeling somewhat marginalised.<ref name=Wilderness>{{cite book |

The club lived on as a junior team during a period that became known as [[The Wilderness Years (Derry City F.C.)|the "wilderness years"]], plying their trade in the local Saturday Morning League to survive, whilst simultaneously seeking re-admission to the Irish League on a number of occasions over the next 13 years.<ref name=Wilderness/> Each time, the club nominated the Brandywell as its chosen home-ground but each time, the Irish League refused to re-admit them despite significant improvements in the overall security situation over the years. Suspecting that refusal was at least in part driven by underhand political and sectarian motives,<ref name=McGuinness/> and believing they would never gain re-admission to the Irish League, Derry decided to turn their attentions elsewhere.

Derry applied to join the rejuvenated [[Football League of Ireland]] (the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland's]] football league at the time) in 1985 with the Brandywell Stadium as their home ground. After discussions and debates over the viability of such a proposal, Derry were eventually welcomed into the league's new First Division for 1985, but only after special dispensation from the [[Irish Football Association]] and further permission from [[FIFA]].<ref name=History> Due the fact that the Brandywell Stadium was situated in a largely [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] area, and the long-term continuing existence of a degree of scepticism within that community towards the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], Derry City also received special dispensation from [[UEFA]] to steward their own games as opposed to the norm of the state's security force carrying out the task. It was felt that the presence of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in areas like the Brandywell would be more likely to provoke trouble than help prevent it.<ref>"[http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000703.htm Football: Sectarianism]", ''Eugene McMenamin MLA, Northern Ireland Assembly Reports'', [[2000-07-03]].

Buoyed by the support of enthusiastic crowds flocking to the Brandywell after having being deprived of local senior football for such a lengthy period in their lives, and fuelled by hunger after an [[FAI Cup]] final defeat in 1988 to [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]], [[Jim McLaughlin (football manager)|Jim McLaughlin]] helped the club to an historic [[the Treble|treble]] - the [[FAI League Cup|League Cup]], the [[Football League of Ireland|League Title]] and the [[FAI Cup]] - in the 1988&ndash;89 season.

[[Image:DerryCityJerseys.PNG|450px|thumb|A selection of past home-kit variations.]]
Derry City wore claret and blue jersies with white shorts for their first season of football - 1929&ndash;30. These were the identical colours to those of [[Aston Villa]], who were a globally-renowned footballing power at the time.<ref name=History/> This scheme lasted until 1932, when the club's first change of colours saw the club directors decide that white jersies with black shorts should be worn by the team for the 1932&ndash;33 season.<ref name=History/> The style, like that which had come before it, lasted just two seasons and was replaced by the now-traditional red and white "candystripes" with black shorts upon the club's changing of its official colours to that of the modern day for the beginning of the 1934-35 season. The new arrangement derived from an early connection with [[Sheffield United]], who wore (and still do wear) the identical pattern. Specifically, the colour-change is attributed to [[Billy Gillespie]],<ref name=History/> a native of Kerrykeel, [[County Donegal|Donegal]].<ref name=Gillespie>"[http://www.irishfa.com/squad-profiles/2036/legends-of-the-game/billie-gillespie/ Squad Profiles - Legends of the Game]", ''Irish Football Association''.

Derry have remained in the red and white stripes since, except for the seasons between 1956 and 1962, when the club's players donned an amber and black kit.<ref name=History/> At the time, the colours were strongly associated with Wolverhampton Wanderers,<ref>"[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Wolverhampton_Wanderers/Wolverhampton_Wanderers.htm Wolverhampton Wanderers]", ''Historical Kits''.

The colours have been retained ever since. Jerseys over the years, although in keeping with the red and white tradition, have had stripes of varying thickness. Derry now wear white socks when sporting their full home kit, while they originally wore black ones. Similarly, the club adopted white shorts instead of black ones for a spell in the early 1970s and later in 1985 for their initial season in the League of Ireland.<ref name=Colours/> The club's away jerseys have varied in colour from plain white, to navy and green stripes, to white and light-blue stripes, and to black.

Derry have had their kits supplied by various manufacturers over the years, including [[Adidas]], [[Avec]], [[Erreà]], [[Fila (company)|Fila]], [[Le Coq Sportif]], [[Matchwinner]], [[O'Neills]], Spall and currently, [[Umbro]]. Commercial sponsorhip logos to appear on the front of shirt have included Northlands, Warwick Wallpapers, [[Fruit of the Loom]], [[Smithwick's]] and AssetCo. Other sponsorship logos to have appeared on the sleeve have included the Trinity Hotel, Tigi Bed Head and Tigi Catwalk. For the 2007 season, the logos of local media, [[Q102.9]] and the [[Derry News]], appear on the back of the shirt just below the neck, along with the logo of Meteor Electrical on the jersey's front.

==Crests==
{{dablink|For further details on this topic, see: [[Traditions of Derry City F.C.]]}}
[[Image:Derry arms 2003.png|left|thumb|100px|The city's coat of arms, used by the club as a crest prior to the introduction of a unique club crest in 1986.]] 
Although the club did not traditionally sport a crest on the club jersey throughout the years of playing in the [[Irish League]], and for most of the first season in the [[League of Ireland]], Derry City used the [[coat of arms]] of the city, rather than having an exclusive crest of their own. This crest often appeared on club memorabilia such as scarves, hats and badges. The symbols on the city of Derry's arms were, and still are, a skeleton, a three-towered castle, a red [[St. George's cross]] and sword. The heading sword and cross were devices of the [[City of London]], and along with an [[Irish harp]] embedded within the cross, demonstrated the link between the two cities (the city's official name under [[United Kingdom|UK]] law is, of course, Londonderry), in particular, the association with [[The Honourable The Irish Society|the Honourable the Irish Society]] which had been granted lands in and around the city in the past. The castle was thought to relate to a 13th or 14th century keep belonging to the local native chieftains while the skeleton was believed to be that of a [[Normans|Norman]] [[Burke|de Burca]] knight who was starved to death in the castle dungeons in 1332.<ref>"[http://www.geographia.com/northern-ireland/ukider01.htm History of Derry]", ''Northern Ireland Tourist Board''. Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref> This was accompanied by the [[Latin]] motto, "''Vita, veritas, victoria''", meaning "Life, truth, victory." 
[[Image:DerryOldCrest.gif|right|thumb|100px|Derry City's first exclusive crest, introduced in 1986 and replaced in 1997 by the current crest.]]
However, in April 1986, the club ran a competition in local schools to design a new crest for the football club. The winning entry was designed by John Devlin, a fourth-year student at [[St. Columb's College|St Columb's College]], and made its debut on [[5 May]], 1986 when Derry City entertained [[Nottingham Forest]] at [[Brandywell Stadium]] for a friendly match.<ref>Webmaster of ''[http://www.derrycityfc.net CityWeb]'', [[User:Niallc99|Niallc99]], [[2007-01-03]].</ref> The crest depicted a simplified version of the city's [[Foyle Bridge]], which had opened 18 months previously, the traditional red and white stripes associated with the shirt of the club, bordered by thin black lines, and the year in which Derry City were established as a club, as well as a football in the centre representing the club as a footballing entity. The name of the club appeared in [[Impact (typeface)|Impact]] font.

With the novel, trendy and innovative nature of the Foyle Bridge featuring in the badge in the mid-to-late 1980s wearing off over time, the crest lasted until July 1997, when the current crest was unveiled at [[Lansdowne Road]] with the meeting of Derry City and [[Celtic F.C|Celtic]] during a pre-season friendly tournament. The fresher, modernised crest, once again, featured a centred football, the club's name and the year of founding in a contemporary [[sans-serif]] font. The famous red and white stripes were present along with a red mass of colour filling the left half of the crest, separated from the right by a white stripe. Known cultural landmarks or items associated with the city were absent from the [[minimalist]] design.

==Home ground==
{{dablink|For further details on this topic, see: [[Brandywell Stadium]]}}
[[Image:Brandywell.jpg||right|thumb|400px|[[Brandywell Stadium|The Brandywell]]; home ground of Derry City.]]
Derry City's home ground is the [[Brandywell Stadium]] situated on the Lone Moor Road just south-west of the [[Bogside]] in the Brandywell area of [[Derry]]. It is more commonly referred to as simply, the 'Brandywell'. The stadium is also a local [[greyhound racing]] venue, with an ovoid running track encircling the football pitch. The dimensions of the pitch itself measure 111 yards in length by 72 yards in width.<ref>"[http://homepage.eircom.net/~scroche/derry.htm Derry City]", ''What's the score?'', [[2000]]-[[January|01]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref> The legal owner of the stadium is the [[Derry City Council]], which, under licence, permits Derry City to make use of the ground.<ref name=History/>

Plans of Derry City's to purchase a pitch fell through after their formation due to the tight time-scale between their birth in 1928 and the season's beginning in 1929 and so the [[Derry City Council|Londonderry Corporation]] (now known as the Derry City Council) was approached for the use of the Brandywell Stadium which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. This began an association between the club and the ground which has survived until the present day. The club are still operating under the constraints of [[The Honourable The Irish Society|the Honourable the Irish Society]] charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community. In effect, the club do not have private ownership over the ground and, thus, cannot develop it by their own accord with that discretion being left to the Derry City Council.<ref name=History/>
[[Image:Derrycity2.jpg|left|thumb||250px|The Brandywell's 'New Stand' under floodlights.]]
Derry City's first game at the Brandywell was a 2-1 loss to [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] on [[22 August]], 1929.<ref name=History/> In 1933, the purchase of another ground was mentioned. The board decided against buying Bond’s Field in the Waterside, however, as it was thought to be too far away from the fanbase which had built up on the Cityside, especially in the Brandywell area. They had first option on Derry Celtic’s old ground, [[Celtic Park (Derry)|Celtic Park]], but hesitated on a final decision and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] bought it ten years later. They also decided against buying Meenan Park for £1,500.<ref name=History/> The club, thus, remained playing in the Brandywell.

Because of [[Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland's]] extremely volatile political situation during the era of the '[[Troubles]]' and past security fears for [[Protestants]] and those of the [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]] tradition visiting the mainly [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] city of [[Derry]], the [[Brandywell]] has not always been the home ground of Derry City. In 1970 and 1971, Derry had to play their 'home' ties against [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] at [[Windsor Park]] in [[Belfast]] - the home-ground of Linfield themselves. Similarly, from September 1971 until October 1972 Derry were forced to play all their 'home' games at the [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|Showgrounds]] in the town of [[Coleraine]], over 30 miles away, as police ruled the area surrounding the [[Brandywell]] was too unsafe for visitors from the unionist community. The [[Brandywell]] did not see senior football for another 13 years as the [[Irish Football League]] upheld a ban on the stadium and Derry decided to leave the league as a result.<ref name=Bradley/> Only greyhound meetings and junior football were held at the venue during this period.<ref name=McGuinness/> Derry's admission to the [[League of Ireland]] in 1985 saw a much-welcomed return of senior games, however.

Due to health and safety regulations the stadium has a seating capacity of 2,900 for European competitions, although it can accommodate 7,700 on a normal match-day, including terraces and seating.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/4775553.stm Brandywell gets seating increase]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[2006-08-09]].

The club is renowned for its warm, close-knit, community spirit and the supporters have played a pivotal role in the survival and successes of the club over the years. When massive debts brought Derry close to extinction in the 2000&ndash;01 season, the local community responded en masse and saved the club. During the club's successful 2006 season, club legend, [[Peter Hutton]] said:
{{cquote|Nobody owns Derry City FC, apart from the people of Derry. Five or six years ago the club was on its knees, on the verge of going out of business.

People, fans, ordinary people; they went out and banged on doors to collect money, they went around pubs with collection buckets, they did what they could to keep the club alive. Derry is a close-knit place, a small community, they care about their club and that's why we still have a club. And every bit of success we may get this season is down to them.<ref>Fitzmaurice, Aidan.

Due to the fact that they are a club based in [[Northern Ireland]] playing in the league of the [[Republic of Ireland]] they often receive the attention of broadcasters in both jurisdictions. A bizarre [[own-goal]], in which the opposition goal-keeper was lobbed from outside the box by a player from his own team, scored by [[Finn Harps|Finn Harps']] Terry Leake for Derry City during a 1989&ndash;90 season [[Brandywell]]-meeting<ref>"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhBDrPydnc&mode=related&search Video of bizarre Finn Harps own-goal]", ''YouTube'', [[2006-11-15]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref> once appeared on the "What happened next?" round of the [[BBC|BBC's]] ''[[A Question of Sport]]''.<ref name=Popculture>Wilson (2007), p. 50.</ref> Furthermore, in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' shown the night before Derry's clash with [[Paris St. Germain]] in the 2006&ndash;07 [[UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup's]] First Round, it was highlighted that [[Archie McLeod]], the grandfather of [[David Tennant]], the tenth ''[[Doctor Who]]'', was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had enticed him over from the highlands of [[Scotland]].<ref>Barratt, Dr. Nick. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_celeb_gallery_04.shtml Who do you think you are? (Third series): David Tennant]", ''BBC History'', [[2006-09-27]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref> Likewise, a number of features based on the club were run by ''[[Football Focus]]'' prior to and after the same UEFA Cup game. Irish television has also featured the club. Derry City played in the first [[League of Ireland]] match ever to be shown live on television when they visited [[Tolka Park]] to play [[Shelbourne FC|Shelbourne]] during the 1996&ndash;97 season. The game was broadcast on [[RTÉ|RTÉ's]] [[Network 2]] and finished 1&ndash;1 with [[Gary Beckett]] scoring for Derry. In addition, during an [[8 January]], 2007 episode of [[RTÉ|RTÉ's]] ''[[The Panel (Ireland)|The Panel]]'', Irish comedian, [[Karl Spain]], was seen drinking from a mug displaying the crest of Derry City. Although Spain himself is not known to be a fan of Derry, one of the shows producers, Seamus Cassidy from Derry, is. During the next show one week later, fellow comedian, [[Dara O'Briain]], was also seen drinking from the mug. On [[22 January]], 2007 the mug was seen in the hands of a third panellist, Irish television and radio personality, [[Ray D'Arcy]].<ref>"[http://www.rte.ie/tv/thepanel/yourmug.html The Panel: THE MUG, and THAT mug in particular]", ''RTÉ.ie'', [[2006]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref><ref name=Popculture/>

Another medium to play host to the club has been the radio. On [[20 April]], 2005, Derry City featured in an audio documentary ''The Blues and the Candy Stripes'' on [[RTÉ Radio 1|RTÉ Radio 1's]] ''Documentary on One''. The documentary was produced in the aftermath of the historic friendly game between Derry and [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] that took place on [[22 February]], 2005 - the first between the two teams to occur since a game on [[25 January]], 1969 during which Linfield's fans had to be evacuated from the [[Brandywell]] by police at half-time due to civil unrest and ugly scenes within the ground.<ref name=Radio>"[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/1044693.html The Blues and the Candy Stripes]", ''RTÉ.ie'', [[2005-04-20]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref> The 2005 match was organised as somewhat of a security test in the run-up to the likely possibility that both teams, with socially polar fan-bases, would qualify for and be drawn against one another in a near-future [[Setanta Cup]] competition.

Moreover, the club has appeared in a joke perpetrated by local printed press outlet, the ''[[Derry Journal]]'', who once reported that [[Gary Lineker]] had signed for Derry. However, the date of the publication was [[1 April]], and the story was, of course, an [[April Fools']] prank.
