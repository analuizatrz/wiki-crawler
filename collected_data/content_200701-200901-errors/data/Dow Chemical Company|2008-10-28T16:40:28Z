'''The Dow Chemical Company''' ({{nyse|DOW}} {{tyo|4850}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Midland, Michigan]]. As of 2007, it is the second largest chemical manufacturer in the world (after [[BASF]]).<ref>[http://www.hoovers.com/Dow%20Chemical/--ID__10471--/freeuk-co-factsheet.xhtml The Dow Chemical Company information and related industry information from Hoover's United Kingdom (UK)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Dow Chemical is a provider of plastics, chemicals, and agricultural products with presence in more than 175 countries and employing 46,000 people worldwide. It spends more than $1 billion annual expenditure in R&D. Its stated mission under the current CEO, [[Andrew N. Liveris]], is:
"To constantly improve what is essential to human progress by mastering science and technology" with the vision: "to be the largest, most profitable, and most respected chemical company in the world".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dow.com/about/aboutdow/vision.htm|title=Dow's vision statement|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>

The company was founded in 1897 by Canadian-born chemist [[Herbert Henry Dow]], who had invented a new method of extracting the [[bromine]] that was trapped underground in [[brine]] at Midland, Michigan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/45.html | title=Hall of Fame Inventor Profile | publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame | accessdate = 2006-06-24}}</ref> While at first the company sold only [[bleach]] and [[potassium bromide]], Dow today has seven major operating segments, with a wide variety of products offered by each.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web | url=http://www.dow.com/about/aboutdow/profile/CorpProfile2006.pdf | title=Corporate Profile | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessdate = 2006-06-24|format=PDF}}</ref> The company's 2005 sales totaled [[United States dollar|$]]46.3 billion, with a net income of $4.5 billion. Traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as of 2005 Dow has about 105,000 shareholders of record.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.dow.com/dow_news/press/pre_fast.htm | title=Fast Facts | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessdate = 2006-06-24}}</ref>

Dow has been called the "Chemical companies' Chemical company"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=il&vol=app/2005/1031657&invol|title=Quote from John Tysse, Dow vice-president of sales and marketing|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref> in that most of their product is sold to other manufacturers rather than to end users. At varying points in time Dow has sold directly to customers, primarily in the Human and Animal Health markets as well as Consumer Products.

Dow Chemical is an active member of the [[American Chemistry Council]], and an active partner in different programs and initiatives in both the [[World Bank]] and [[United Nations]].

== Products ==
Dow is the world's largest producer of [[plastic]]s, including [[polystyrene]], [[polyurethane]]s, [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], and synthetic [[rubber]]s {{Fact|date=July 2008}}. It is also a major producer of the chemicals [[calcium chloride]], [[ethylene oxide]], and various [[acrylate]]s, [[surfactant]]s, and [[cellulose]] resins. It produces many agricultural chemicals, perhaps being most famous for its [[pesticide]] [[Lorsban]].<ref name="autogenerated2" />  Its most well-known [[consumer products]] include [[Styrofoam|Styrofoam brand insulation]]. Former Dow product lines, [[Saran (plastic)|Saran]] wrap, [[Ziploc]] bags and [[Scrubbing Bubbles]] have been sold to [[S. C. Johnson & Son]].

===Performance plastics===

Performance Plastics make up 25% of Dow's sales,<ref name="autogenerated3">''Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10-15</ref> with many products designed for the [[automotive industry|automotive]] and [[construction industry|construction industries]]. The [[plastic]]s include [[polyolefin]]s such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]], as well as the [[polystyrene]] most often seen in [[Styrofoam]] insulating material. A complete range of [[epoxy]] resin intermediates and products are manufactured by Dow, including [[bisphenol A]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]. [[Polyurethane]], polyether polyols and specialty [[acrylate]]s are all derived from [[ethylene oxide]] (EO). The [[Saran (plastic)|Saran]] range of resins and films, formerly based on [[polyvinylidene chloride]] (PVDC), is now based on [[low density polyethylene]] (LDPE), due to environmental concerns of the chloride.

===Performance chemicals===

The Performance Chemicals (17% of sales) segment produces materials for [[water purification]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, paper [[coating]]s, paints and advanced [[electronics industry|electronics]]. Major product lines include nitroparaffins such as [[nitromethane]], used in the pharmaceutical industry and manufactured by ANGUS Chemical Company,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dow.com/angus/ | title=ANGUS Chemical Company | publisher= The Dow Chemical Company | accessdate = 2006-06-26}}</ref> a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company. Important polymers include Dowlex [[ion exchange resin]]s, [[acryl group|acrylic]] and polystyrene [[latex]], as well as Carbowax [[polyethylene glycol]]s. Specialty chemicals are used as starting materials for production of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

====Water Purification====
Dow Chemicals's water solutions [[Strategic business unit|business unit]] manufactures Filmtec reverse osmosis membranes which are used widely for purification of water for [[Potable|human use]] in the [[Middle East]], in countries including: [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Jordan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The technology was also used during the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/ENV_148211.html | title=Dow's Filmtec to help manage ME water needs | publisher= Trade Arabia | accessdate = 2008-08-26}}</ref>

===Agricultural sciences===

Agricultural Sciences ([[Dow AgroSciences]]) provides 7% of sales, and are responsible for a range of [[insecticide]]s (such as [[Lorsban]]), [[herbicides]] and [[fungicide|fungicides]]. Genetically modified plant seeds are also an important, growing area. Dow AgroSciences sells seeds commercially under the following brands: Mycogen (grain corn, silage corn, sunflowers, alfalfa, and sorghum), Atlas (soybean) and PhytoGen (cotton).

===Basic plastics===

Basic plastics (26% of sales) end up in everything from [[diaper]] liners to beverage [[bottle]]s and oil tanks. Products are based on the three major polyolefins – polystyrene (such as Styron resins), polyethylene and polypropylene.

===Basic chemicals===

Basic chemicals (12% of sales) are used internally by Dow as raw materials, and are also sold worldwide. Markets include dry cleaning, paints and coatings, snow and ice control and the food industry. Major products include ethylene glycol, [[Sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]], [[chlorine]], [[vinyl chloride]] monomer (VCM, for making [[PVC]]) and [[calcium chloride]]. [[Ethylene oxide]] (EO) and [[propylene oxide]] and the derived alcohols [[ethylene glycol]] and [[propylene glycol]] are major feedstocks for the manufacture of plastics such as polyurethane and [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].

===Hydrocarbons and energy===

The Hydrocarbons and Energy operating segment (13% of sales) oversees energy management at Dow, succeeding in raising energy efficiency by 92% since 1990.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Fuels and oil-based raw materials are also procured. Major feedstocks for Dow are provided by this group, including [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], [[1,3-butadiene]], [[benzene]] and [[styrene]].

== History ==
===Early history===

The company originally sold only [[bleach]] and [[potassium bromide]], achieving a daily bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902. Early in the company's existence, a group of [[Economy of the United Kingdom|British]] manufacturers attempted to drive Dow out of the bleach business by cutting prices. Dow survived by cutting prices in response and, although losing about $90,000 in income, began to diversify its [[product line]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.geo.msu.edu/geo333/dow.html | title=Dow Chemical | publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Department of Geography | accessdate = 2006-06-24}}</ref> In 1905 German bromide producers drastically reduced their price of bromides in the US in an effort to prevent Dow from expanding its sales of bromides in Europe. Dow was able to purchase German-made bromides in the US, ship them back to Europe and still sell them at a lower price than the German producers were charging.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brandt |first=E.N.|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Growth Company: Dow Chemical's First Century |year=1997 |publisher=Michigan State University Press |location=East Lansing, MI |isbn=0-87013-426-4 }}</ref> Even in its early history, the company set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its [[product line]]. Within twenty years, Dow had become a major producer of [[agricultural]] chemicals, elemental [[chlorine]], [[phenol]] and other [[dye]]stuffs, and [[magnesium]] metal.

In the 1930s, Dow began production of plastic resins, which would grow to become one of the corporation's major businesses. Its first plastic products were [[ethylcellulose]], made in 1935, and [[polystyrene]], made in 1937.

===Diversification and expansion===
In 1940-1, Dow built its first plant to produce [[magnesium]] extracted from [[seawater]] rather than underground brine. This marked the first time man had 'mined the ocean for metal'.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm History of Texas Operations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Growth of this business made Dow a strategically important business during [[World War II]], as magnesium became important in fabricating lightweight parts for [[aircraft]]. Also during the war, Dow and [[Corning Glass Works|Corning]] began their joint venture, [[Dow Corning]], to produce [[silicone]]s for military and later civilian use. In 1942 Dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of Dow Chemical of Canada in [[Sarnia, Ontario]] to produce [[styrene]] for use in [[styrene-butadiene]] [[synthetic rubber]].

In 1940, Dow began plant construction in Freeport, Texas. This is now the home to Dow's largest site - and one of the largest integrated chemical manufacturing sites in the world. One of the first plants to come on stream was the first facility to extract magnesium from seawater. The site grew quickly - with power, chlorine, caustic soda and ethylene also soon in production.<ref name="autogenerated1" />  Based on 2002-2003 data, the Freeport plants (known as Texas Operations internally) produced 27 billion pounds of product - or 21% of Dow's global production.<ref>[http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/facts.htm Dow Texas Operations Fast Facts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the post-war era, Dow began expanding outside North America, founding its first overseas subsidiary in [[Economy of Japan|Japan]] in 1952, with several other nations following rapidly thereafter. Based largely on its growing plastics business, it opened a consumer products division beginning with Saran wrap in 1953. Based on its growing chemicals and plastics businesses, Dow's sales exceeded $1 billion in 1964, $2 billion in 1971, and $10 billion in 1980.

===Vietnam war: Napalm and Agent Orange===
During the [[Vietnam War]], Dow became the sole supplier of [[napalm]] to the [[United States military]] who used the Napalm in their efforts during the war.

{{main|Agent Orange}}
[[Agent Orange]], a chemical [[defoliant]] containing [[dioxin]], was also manufactured by Dow in [[New Plymouth]], [[New Zealand]] and in America for use by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. In 2005, a lawsuit was filed by Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange against Dow and [[Monsanto]], which also supplied Agent Orange to the military. The lawsuit was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/122591.asp | title = US won't compensate Vietnam's Agent Orange victims: official | date=2006-06-06 | publisher=Todayonline.com | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}</ref>

===Dow Corning Breast implants===
See Also: [[Dow Corning#Breast Implants Controversy|Dow Corning Breast Implants Controversy]]

A major manufacturer of silicone [[breast implants]], [[Dow Corning]] (Dow Chemical's Joint Venture with [[Corning Inc.]]) was sued for personal damages caused by ruptured implants. Per the 2005 10-K for The Dow Chemical Company filing "On October 6, 2005, all such cases then pending in the District Court against the Company were dismissed. Should cases involving Dow Corning’s breast implant and other silicone medical products be filed against the Company in the future, they will be accorded similar treatment." The Dow Chemical Company - 10-K Filing - 2005

===DBCP===
Until the late 1970s, Dow produced [[DBCP]] (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), a soil fumigant and [[nematicide]] sold under the names the Nemagon and Fumazone. Workers at Dow's DBCP production were made sterile by exposure to the compound. These male reproductive effects were consistent with animal experiments showing that DBCP sterilized rabbits. The workers successfully sued the company, and most domestic uses of DBCP were banned in 1977. Amid growing concerns over the chemical's effects on male workers, Dow ceased production and reclaimed DBCP that had been shipped to its users. Despite warning from the company about its health effects, [[Dole Food Company]], who was using the chemical on its [[banana]] plantations in [[Latin America]], threatened to sue Dow if it stopped DBCP shipments, so Dow shipped half a million gallons of DBCP to Dole, much it reclaimed from other users. Plantation workers who became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued both Dow and Dole in Latin American courts, alleging that their ailments were caused by DBCP exposure. While the courts agreed with the workers and awarded them over $600 million in damages, they have been unable to collect payments from the companies. A group of workers then sued in the United States, and, on November 5, 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded them 3.2 million dollars. Dole and Dow vowed to appeal the decision.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-dole6nov06,1,2105565.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-california "Dole must pay farmworkers $3.2 million"], John Spano, ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 6, 2007.</ref>

===Recent Mergers, Acquisitions, and Reorganization===
====1990's &ndash; transition from geographic alignment to global business units====

In the early 1990s, Dow embarked on a major structural reorganization. The former reporting hierarchy was geographic based, with the regional president reporting directly to the overall company President and CEO. The new organization groups together the same businesses from different sites, irrespective of which region they belong (i.e. the vice president for Polystyrene is now in charge of these plants all over the word), almost reducing the regional president to a figurehead.  

In 1995, Dow was fined $732,000 for not sending the EPA reports it had received on 249 Dursban poisoning incidents. In June 2000, Dow withdrew registration of chlorpyrifos for use in homes and other places where children could be exposed, and severely restricted its use on crops. The company, however, continues to market Dursban in industrializing countries, including India, where Dow's sales literature claimed Dursban has "an established record of safety regarding humans and pets."

In 2003, Dow agreed to pay $2 million - the largest penalty ever in a pesticide case - to the state of New York, in response to a lawsuit filed by the Attorney General to end Dow's illegal advertising of Dursban as "safe".

====Union Carbide merger====
At the beginning of August 1999, Dow agreed to purchase [[Union Carbide Corporation]] for $9.3&nbsp;billion in stock. At the time the combined company was the second largest chemical company, behind [[DuPont]]. This led to protests from some stockholders, who feared that Dow would become responsible for Union Carbide's role in the [[Bhopal disaster]].

[[William S. Stavropoulos|Bill Stavropoulos]] served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1995-2000 and again from 2002-2004. He relinquished his board seat on April 1, 2006, having been a director since 1990 and chairman since 2000. During his first tenure, he led the purchase of [[Union Carbide]] which had proven controversial, as it was initially blamed for poor results under his successor as CEO Mike Parker. Parker was dismissed and Stavropoulos returned from retirement to lead a turnaround of Dow.<ref>[http://news.dow.com/corporate/2005/20051213a.htm William Stavropoulos to Retire as Chairman of Dow; Andrew Liveris Elected Chairman Effective April 1, 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Today, Dow is the world's largest producer of plastics{{Fact|date=July 2008}}; with its 2001 acquisition of [[Union Carbide]], it has become a major player in the [[petrochemical]] industry as well.

====Rohm & Haas Company purchase====

On July 10, 2008, Dow agreed to [[Buyout|purchase]] all of the [[Common stock|common equity]] interest of [[Rohm and Haas]] Company for $18.8 billion, which equates to $78 for each share. The buyout will be financed with equity investments of $3 billion by [[Berkshire Hathaway Inc.]] and $1 billion by the [[Kuwait Investment Authority]]. The purpose of the deal is to move Dow Chemical further into specialty chemicals, which offer higher profit margins than the commodities market and are more difficult to enter for the competition. The purchase has been criticized by many on [[Wall Street]] who believe Dow Chemical overpaid (about a 75% premium on the previous day's market capital) to acquire the company; however, the high bid was needed to ward off competing bids from [[BASF]]. The deal is expected to be finalized in early 2009 and will form one of the nation's largest specialty chemicals firms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-fri-dow-chemical-rohm-haas-jul11,0,3989958.story | title="Dow Chemical agrees to buy Rohm & Haas" | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=2008-07-11 | accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref><ref>Dow Chemical to Buy Rohm and Haas, Wall Street Journal, July 11, 2008, p.B1</ref>

==== 2006-2008 Restructuring ====
On August 31, 2006 Dow announced that it had plans to close facilities at three locations:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.dow.com/dow_news/corporate/2006/20060831g.htm | title=Dow Announces Plant Closures To Strengthen Competitive Position | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | date=2006-08-31 | accessdate = 2006-09-13}}</ref>
*It will shut down all of its production in [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]], [[Ontario]] by the end of 2008. Sarnia had been Dow's first manufacturing site in Canada. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for [[World War II]]). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. Up to the early 1990s, the Chemical Valley site contained numerous plants, while Dow Canada's headquarters were located at the [[Highway 40 (Ontario)|Modeland Centre]], and a new River Centre complex was opened which housed Research and Development. Since then, several plants on the site have been dismantled and Dow Canada headquarters were moved to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], while the Dow Fitness Centre was donated to YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia. In 2000, Sarnia Site was the location of a pilot plant for ethylene-styrene interpolymer (ESI) but ending up production never progressed and the project was ended. In 2002, the old steam plant was demolished and land on the site was sold to [[TransAlta]] which built a new natural gas power plant. As of 2003, the remaining plants on the site produce Polystyrene, Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Epoxy Resins, Polyols (Propylene Oxide Derivatives), and Latexes.<ref>[http://www.dow.com/publicreport/2003/local/sarnia/letter.htm Letter from the Site Leader — Steve Bolt<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*One plant (Dow terminology for a production unit) at its site in [[Porto Marghera (Venice)]], [[Italy]], which had been shut down for planned maintenance earlier that month, will not be restarted.
*Two plants at its major site in [[Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta|Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] were to be shut down by the end of October 2006.

In December 2007, Dow announced a series of moves to revamp the company. A December 4 announcement revealed that Dow planned to exit the automotive sealers business in 2008 or 2009.<ref name=nytdec52007>{{Cite web|title=Dow Chemical Job Cuts|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/business/05dow.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 5, 2007|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>  Within several weeks, Dow also announced the formation of a joint venture, later named [[K-Dow]], with the Petrochemical Industries Company, a subsidiary of [[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation]]. In exchange for $9.5&nbsp;billion, Dow sold a 50% interest in five of its global businesses: polyethylene, polypropylene and polycarbonate plastics, and ethylenamines and ethanolamines.<ref name=nytdec142007>{{cite web|title=Dow Chemical Gets Kuwaiti Partner|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/business/worldbusiness/14chemical.html|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>

===Chlorpyrifos===
[[Chlorpyrifos]], marketed by Dow as Dursban, is well known as a home and garden [[insecticide]], and until 2000 it was one of the most widely used household [[pesticide]] in the US. The pesticide is also a nerve toxin and suspected [[endocrine disruptor]] and has been associated with [[carcinogenicity]], reproductive and developmental [[toxicity]], and [[acute toxicity]]. One study claims that Dow has contributed to 80% of the Chlorpyrifos burden of the US{{Fact|date=August 2008}}.

=== Dioxin Leaks ===
Areas along Michigan's [[Tittabawassee River]], which runs within yards of Dow's main plant in [[Midland, MI|Midland]], were found to contain elevated levels of the cancer-causing chemical [[dioxin]] in November 2006. The dioxin was located in sediments two to ten feet below the surface of the river, and, according to the ''[[New York Times]]'', "there is no indication that residents or workers in the area are directly exposed to the sites".<ref name=barringer2>{{cite web|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|title=E.P.A. and Dow in Talks on Dioxin Cleanup at Main Factory|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 4, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/us/04dioxin.html|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>  However, people who often eat fish from the river had slightly elevated levels of dioxin in their blood.<ref name=barringer2/>  In July 2007, Dow reached an agreement with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to remove {{convert|50000|cuyd|m3}} of sediment from three areas of the riverbed and levees of the river that had been found to be contaminated.<ref name=barringer>{{cite web|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|title=Michigan: Dioxin Deal|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/us/18brfs-dioxin.html|date=July 18, 2007|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>

==Environmental Record==

Based on year 2000 data,<ref>[http://www.peri.umass.edu/Technical-Notes.264.0.html Political Economy Research Institute Toxic 100 Corporate Toxics Information Project Technical Notes retrieved 12 November 2007]</ref> researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute determined that Dow Chemical was ranked eleventh among corporations in a measure of toxicity of airborne pollutants emitted in the United States, releasing more than 14 million pounds of toxins into American air in that year. (The statistics given are not correlated to the volume of production.)<ref>[http://www.peri.umass.edu/Toxic-100-Table.265.0.html Political Economy Research Institute]</ref> According to [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) documents Dow has some responsibility for 96 of the United States' worst [[Superfund]] [[toxic waste]] dumps, in tenth place by number of sites. One of these, a mining site, is listed as the sole responsibility of Dow: all the rest are shared with numerous other companies. Fifteen sites have been listed by the EPA as finalized (cleaned up) and 69 are listed as "construction complete", meaning that all required plans and equipment for cleanup are in place.<ref>[http://www.publicintegrity.org/superfund/Company.aspx?act=10312 Center for Public Integrity]</ref>

In 2007, Dow was awarded an American Chemical Council (ACC) award of 'Exceptional Merit' in recognition of its longstanding energy efficiency and conservation efforts. Between 1995 and 2005, Dow reduced energy intensity (BTU per pound produced) by 22%. This is equivalent to saving enough electricity to power eight million US homes for a year.<ref>[http://www.csrwire.com/News/8515.html Dow Wins 2006 ACC Responsible Care Energy Efficiency Award<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The same year, Dow subsidiary Dow Agrosciences won a United Nations Montreal Protocol Innovators Award for its efforts in helping replace methyl bromide - a compound identified as contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. In addition, Dow Agrosciences won an EPA "Best of the Best" Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award. [http://www.seedtoday.com/articles/Dow_Agrosciences_Wins_UN_Award_for_Methyl_Bromide_Alternative-48678.html]. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) named Dow as a 2008 [[Energy Star]] Partner of the Year for excellence in energy management and reductions in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.<ref>{{cite news  | title = EPA Names The Dow Chemical Company 2008 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year  | publisher = MSN Money  | date = 2008-03-14PM ET  | url = http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/ticker/article.aspx?Feed=PR&Date=20080314&ID=8341331&Symbol=DOW  | accessdate =2008-03-18 }}</ref>

In 2008, Dow was reported<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jun/29/food.agriculture | title=Homegrown veg ruined by toxic fertiliser | author=Davies, Caroline | date=2008-06-29 | publisher=The Observer | accessdate = 2008-07-02}}</ref> as being the major supplier of pesticides based on [[aminopyralid]] which had contaminated manure and caused widespread loss of vegetable crops in allotments and gardens across the UK.

=== 2007 dismissal of senior executives ===
On April 12, 2007, Dow dismissed two senior executives for "unauthorized discussions with third parties about the potential sale of the company."  The two figures are executive vice president Romeo Kreinberg, and director and former [[Chief Financial Officer|CFO]] J. Pedro Reinhard. Dow claims they were secretly in contact with [[JPMorgan Chase]]; at the same time, a story surfaced in Britain's [[Sunday Express]] regarding a possible [[leveraged buyout]] of Dow. The two executives have since filed lawsuits claiming they were fired for being a threat to CEO Liveris, and that the allegations were concocted as a pretext.<ref>{{Citation | title ="Former Dow executives fight back" | newspaper =[[Chemical and Engineering News]] | pages =12 | year =2007 | date =May 14 | url =http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/85/i20/8520notw6.html }}</ref> However, in June 2008 Dow Chemical and the litigants announced a settlement in which Kreinberg and Reinhard dropped their lawsuits and admitted taking part in discussions "which were not authorized by, nor disclosed to, Dow's board concerning a potential LBO" and acknowledged that it would have been appropriate to have informed the CEO and board of the talks.<ref>{{Citation | title ="Case Closed" | newspaper =[[Chemical and Engineering News]] | pages =10 | year =2008 | date =June 19 | url =http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/86/i23/8623notw2.html }}</ref>

== Major Sponsorships==
In September 2004, the company obtained the naming rights to the Saginaw County Event Center in [[Saginaw, Michigan]]; the center is now called the [[Dow Event Center]]. The [[Saginaw Spirit]] (of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]) plays at the Center, which also hosts events such as [[professional wrestling]] and live theater.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/michigan/outreach/eventcenter.htm | title=The Dow Event Center | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.doweventcenter.com/ | title=Welcome to the Dow Event Center | publisher=Dow Event Center | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}</ref>

In October 2006 the company bought the naming rights to the stadium used by the [[Great Lakes Loons]], a [[Midwest League|Single-A]] [[minor league baseball]] team located in its hometown of Midland, Michigan. The stadium, which opened in April 2007, is called [[Dow Diamond]]. The Dow Foundation played a key role in bringing the Loons to the city.

The company also sponsors a global running relay to highlight the need for better drinking water in locations around the globe. The run will roughly follow the 41st North parallel and cover nearly {{convert|12000|mi|km}}. The run is organized by the Blue Planet Run Foundation.

Dow owns the [[Saginaw River Light]] and is active in its restoration.

==Outlook==
Dow CEO [[Andrew N. Liveris]] called 2005 the company's "best year ever" with operating profits of $5.4 billion, a jump of 56.5% compared with the previous year.<ref>"Top 50 Chemical Producers", ''Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 20 (May 15, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>  Net income rose more than 60% to $4.5 billion, on sales of $46.3 billion. 2006 looks as if it could be even better, with first-quarter net earnings of $1.2 billion.<ref name="liveris">''"Liveris Tells It Like It Is", Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>  All this is occurring in the context of adverse operating conditions, caused by high energy and raw material costs, and the effects of two damaging hurricanes.

Liveris supports the vertically integrated approach used at Dow, which produces everything from basic chemical feedstocks to high value products such as pesticides and reverse osmosis membranes. These value-adding product chains, along with Dow's wide product range, help the company to weather the storms of the global economy. Despite this, high energy and feedstock costs may begin to take their toll, particularly if global demand begins to fall just as supply is rising.

Like many chemical companies, Dow is facing pressures of regulation in the US and [[Economy of the European Union|Europe]], particularly as the [[European Union|EU]] introduces its new [[Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals|REACH]] policy. Litigation costs in the US taken over by Dow as a result of its 2001 takeover of [[Union Carbide]] also remain a concern.  

For these reasons the company is looking to the Middle East and Asia for new projects. In [[Kuwait]] , Dow is constructing (with [[Petrochemical Industries Company|PIC of Kuwait]]) a new world-scale [[petroleum cracking|ethane cracker]] for production of [[ethylene]], along with an [[ethylene oxide]]/[[ethylene glycol]] plant and (for 2008) a facility for production of [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s. In [[Oman]], the company is working with the Oman government to build a new world-scale [[polyethylene]] plant. In China, the company is collaborating with [[Shenhua Group]] (the country's largest [[coal mining]] company) to improve [[catalyst]] efficiency to allow viable conversion of [[coal]] to [[alkene|olefin]]s. Dow is also seeking to expand its [[Research and development|R&D]] presence in Asia, adding 600 jobs in [[Shanghai]] by the end of 2007, and the company may open up a large R&D center in India. 

The joint ventures planned for Asia are typical of Dow's "asset-light" approach, which works by offering a combination of intellectual property and money in exchange for a share in a world-scale production facility. At the same time, the company is considering selling a share of some of its existing assets in order to free up cash.  

In June 2006 Liveris announced Dow's [[safety]] and [[environmentalism|environmental]] goals for 2015:<ref name="liveris"/>
* 75% reduction in environmental, health and safety indicators from 2005. The company aims to have no fatalities, and a reduction in injuries, spillages and leaks.
* 25% increase in [[energy efficiency]].
* 2.5% annual reduction in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions intensity.
Liveris expects these goals to be reached predominantly with [[fossil fuel]]s, through [[energy conservation]] and reduction of [[energy intensity]], as he does not expect [[alternative energy]] to play a major role for at least 10–20 years.
