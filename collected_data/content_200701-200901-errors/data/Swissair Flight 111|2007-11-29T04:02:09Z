'''Swissair Flight 111''' (SR-111, SWR-111) was a [[Swissair]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] on a scheduled airline flight from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[New York City]], [[United States]] to [[Cointrin International Airport]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. This flight was also a [[codeshare]] flight with [[Delta Air Lines]].

On [[September 2]], [[1998]] the aircraft used for the flight, registered HB-IWF, crashed into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] southwest of [[Halifax International Airport]] at the entrance to [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margarets Bay]], [[Nova Scotia]].  The crash site was 8 [[kilometre|km]] from shore, roughly equidistant between the tiny fishing and tourist communities of [[Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia|Peggys Cove]] and Bayswater.  All 229 people on board were killed.<ref>[http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=09021998&reg=HB-IWF&airline=Swissair AirDisaster.com database]</ref>

The resulting investigation by the [[Transportation Safety Board of Canada]] (TSB) took over four years and cost [[United States dollar|US$]]39 million ([[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]57 million).<ref>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/aircrash/dissection.html PBS.org "Nova: Crash of Flight 111" Referenced [[August 5]], [[2006]]</ref> Their main conclusion was that flammable material used in the aircraft's structure allowed a fire to spread beyond the control of the crew, resulting in the loss of control and crash of the aircraft.<ref>TSB Report ''Conclusions'' 3.1, page 253, "Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors", paragraph 1</ref>

Prior to the crash, Swissair 111 was known as the "[[United Nations|U.N.]] shuttle" due to its popularity with [[United Nations]] officials; the flight often carried business executives, scientists, and researchers  <ref>"[http://www.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2003-02-16-swissair-investigation_x.htm Doomed plane's gaming system exposes holes in FAA oversight]," ''[[USA Today]]'', [[February 16]], [[2003]]</ref>.

==History==
===The aircraft and its crew===

The aircraft, a [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]], serial number 48448, was manufactured in 1991 and Swissair was the only operator. The airframe had a total of 36,041 hours. The three engines were [[Pratt & Whitney]] [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000|4462]]s. The cabin was configured with 241 seats (12 first-, 49 business-, and 180 economy-class). First- and business-class seats were equipped with an in-flight entertainment system.<ref>TSB 1.6, page 9, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_06_00.asp Aircraft Information]" </ref>

The standard crew of MD-11 is a flight crew of a captain and a first officer, and a cabin crew of a [[maître de cabine]] (M/C - [[purser]]) and 11 [[flight attendant]]s. All personnel were qualified, certified and trained in accordance with Swiss regulations,  under the [[Joint Aviation Authorities]] (JAA).<ref>TSB 1.5, pages 5-7, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_05_00.asp Personnel Information]" </ref>

===The flight===

[[Image:Varig.md11.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of a [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]]]

Flight SR-111 departed JFK at 20:18 ([[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]]) with 215 passengers, 2 pilots and 12 flight attendants en route to [[Geneva]]. Originally Swissair stated that 39 [[Switzerland|Swiss]], 30 [[France|French]], 137 [[United States|American]]s, 1 Canadian, and 22 other people were on the flight <ref>"[http://archives.cbc.ca/400d.asp?id=1-70-1781-12112-10&wm6=1 Swissair 111 crashes in the ocean near Peggy's Cove]," ''[[CBC]]''</ref>. The numbers were later revised to 132 Americans (including one [[Delta Air Lines]] flight attendant), 41 Swiss (including 13 crew members), 30 French, 6 [[United Kingdom|Britons]], 3 [[Germany|Germans]], 2 [[Greece|Greek]]s, 2 [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], 1 each from [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Spain]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Sweden]], and [[Yugoslavia]], and 4 others. Delta sold the tickets of 53 of the Swissair passengers as part of a codeshare arrangement <ref>"[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/04/swissair.crash.01/ From Europe and New York, grieving families head to crash site]," ''[[CNN]]''</ref>. Since [[Air Canada]] was on strike at the time, some passengers who would have flown on Air Canada instead flew Swissair 111 <ref>"[http://starbulletin.com/98/09/05/news/story1.html Isle family

At 22:10 [[Atlantic Time]], cruising at [[Flight level|FL330]], or {{convert|33000|ft|m|0}}, the flight crew Captain Urs Zimmermann and First Officer Stephan Loew, smelled an odour in the cockpit and determined it to be smoke in the air conditioning system.  Four minutes later, the smoke was visible and the pilots began considering a diversion to a nearby airport for the purpose of a quick landing.  At 22:14 AT the flight crew made a "[[pan-pan]]" radio call, indicating that an emergency exists but there is no immediate danger to the aircraft, and requested a diversion to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]'s [[Logan International Airport]] (300 nautical miles away), but was instead directed to the closer [[Halifax International Airport]] in [[Enfield, Nova Scotia]], 66 nm (104 km) away.  The crew then put on their oxygen masks and began descending.

At 22:19 AT the plane was 30 [[nautical mile]]s away from Halifax airport, but required more time to descend from its current altitude of 21,000 feet.  At 22:20 AT the crew informed [[air traffic control|ATC]] that it needed to dump fuel, and was subsequently diverted away from the airport. According to the [[checklist]] ''In case of smoke of unknown origin'', the crew shut-off the power supply in the cabin, which caused the recirculating fans to shut off. This induced the fire, by a vacuum phenomenon, to spread back into the cockpit. At 22:24 AT, the crew declared an emergency. Aircraft systems, such as lighting, flight instruments, and the autopilot began to fail and as a result the crew slowly lost any means of successfully flying the aircraft. According to readings from [[Seismometer|seismographic recorders]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Moncton]], the aircraft struck the ocean at 22:31 AT.<ref>TSB 1.1, pages 1-3, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_01_00.asp History of the Flight]", paragraph 13 </ref> The crash location was approximately {{coor at dms|44|24|33|N|63|58|25|W|region:CA-NS_type:landmark_scale:500000}}, with 300 metres' uncertainty.<ref>http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/media/emergency/background/location_debris_field.asp</ref>

==Recovery and investigation==

The aircraft broke apart on impact with the water, and most of the debris sank to the ocean floor (a depth of 55 m or 180 ft). Some debris was found floating in the crash area, and over the following weeks debris washed up on the nearby shorelines.<ref name="recovery">TSB 1.12, page 77, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_12_01.asp Wreckage Recovery]"</ref>

The initial focus of the recovery was on finding and identifying human remains, and finding the [[flight recorder]]s, but this proved difficult as the force of impact was "in the order of at least 350 [[g-force|''g'']],"
<ref>TSB 1.13.3, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_13_03.asp Injury Patterns]"
</ref> 
and the environmental conditions, only allowed recovery along with wreckage.
<ref>TSB 1.13, page 103-105, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_13_01.asp Recovery of Occupants]"
</ref> 
Only one of the victims was visually identifiable. 147 were identified by fingerprint, dental records, and X-ray comparisons. The remaining 81 were identified through DNA tests.
<ref>Butler, page 264, "DNA Testing in High Profile Cases"
</ref>

The [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) and [[flight data recorder]] (FDR) were found by the submarine ''[[HMCS Okanagan]]'' using sonar to detect the underwater locator beacon signals, and quickly retrieved by Navy divers (the FDR on [[September 6]] and the CVR on [[September 11]], [[1998]]). However, both had stopped recording at approximately 10,000 ft, six minutes before impact.

The survey and recovery, dubbed ''Operation Persistence'' was TSB guided with resources from the military, CCG, RCMP, and many others.  The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and [[remotely  operated vehicle]]s to locate items, then recovered (initially by divers and ROV's, later by dredging and trawling).<ref>[http://www.noac-national.ca/article/wiggins/minorwarvesselinvolvementwithoperationpersistence_bytmwiggins.html Minor War Vessel Involvement, T.W. Wiggins]</ref>

On [[October 2]], [[1998]] the [[Transportation Safety Board of Canada]] (TSB) initiated a heavy lift operation to retrieve the major portion of the wreckage from the deep water before the expected winter storms began. By [[October 21]], 27% of the wreckage was recovered.
<ref>[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/media/fact_sheets/A98H0003/chronology_a98h0003.asp TSB chronology]
</ref>

At this point in the investigation, the cause of the crash was generally believed to be due to faulty wiring in the cockpit, after the entertainment system in the plane started to overheat. Certain groups issued Aviation Safety Recommendations. The TSB released its preliminary report [[August 30]], [[2000]], but the final report was not completed until 2003.

The final phase of wreckage recovery by [[dredging]] ended in December 1999 with 98% of the aircraft retrieved: approximately 126,554 kg (279,000 lb) of aircraft debris and 18,144 kg (40,000 lb) of cargo.<ref name="recovery"/>

===Examination===
[[Image:Swissair 111 debris.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Cargo door and other debris recovered]]
An estimated 2 million pieces of debris were recovered and brought ashore for inspection at a secure handling facility in a marine industrial park at [[Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia|Sheet Harbour]] where small material was hand inspected by teams of RCMP officers looking for human remains, personal effects and valuables from the aircraft's cargo hold.  The material was then transported to [[CFB Shearwater]] where it was assembled and inspected by over 350 investigators from multiple organizations such as TSB, [[NTSB]], [[FAA]], [[AAIB]], [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Boeing]], and [[Pratt & Whitney]]. 
<ref>TSB 1.12.2.1, page 80, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_12_02.asp Aircraft Wreckage Examination]</ref>
<ref>TSB Supporting Technical Information [http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/02sti/16researchandinvestigation/testsandresearch.asp#recoveryprocedures STI-098]</ref>

As each piece of wreckage was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with freshwater, sorted, and weighed. The item was then placed in a specific area of a Hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was then weighed and moved to a custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar.
<ref>TSB 1.19.1, page 197-198, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_19_01.asp Exhibit Tracking Process]</ref> Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks. 

====Cockpit====
The front 10m (33 feet) of the aircraft, from the front of the cockpit to near the front of the first-class passenger cabin, was reconstructed. Information gained by this allowed investigators to determine the severity and limits of the fire damage, its possible origins and progression.
<ref>TSB 1.19.3, page 199, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_19_03.asp Partial Aircraft Reconstruction]</ref> 

====CVR and FDR====
The [[cockpit voice recorder]] used a 1/4 inch recording tape, operating on a 30 minute loop. It therefore only retained the last half hour of the flight, from 8:58:15.8 pm EDT until 9:25:41.
<ref name ="CVR">TSB 1.11, pages 73-74, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_11_00.asp Flight Recorders]
</ref>
The CVR recording and transcript are protected by a strict privilege under [http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-23.4/sec28.html section 28] of the ''Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act'' and thus have not been publicly disclosed. The air traffic control recordings are less strictly privileged: [http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-23.4/sec29.html section 29] of the same Act provides only that they may not be used in certain legal proceedings. The air traffic control transcripts were released within days of the crash in 1998 and appear on publicly accessible websites, including 
aviation-safety.net

It also operated off the aircraft power, and stopped recording when the aircraft lost electrical power at 9:25 pm EDT (10:25 local time).<ref name="CVR"/>

===TSB Findings===
The investigation identified eleven causes and contributing factors of the crash in their final report. The first and most important was:

<blockquote>
Aircraft certification standards for material flammability were inadequate in that they allowed the use of materials that could be ignited and sustain or propagate fire. Consequently, flammable material propagated a fire that started above the ceiling on the right side of the cockpit near the cockpit rear wall. The fire spread and intensified rapidly to the extent that it degraded aircraft systems and the cockpit environment, and ultimately led to the loss of control of the aircraft.<ref name="TSB3.1">TSB 3.1, page 253, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/03conclusions/rep3_01_00.asp Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors]</ref>
</blockquote>

[[Electric arc|Arcing]] from wiring of the [[in-flight entertainment]] system network did not trip the [[circuit breaker]]s. While suggestive, the investigation was unable to confirm if it was this arc that ignited the flammable covering on insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials.<ref name="TSB3.1"/> The crew did not recognize that a fire had started and were not warned by instruments. Once they became aware of the fire, the uncertainty of the problem made it difficult to address. The rapid spread of the fire led to the failure of key display systems, and the crew's ability to control the aircraft was soon overcome. Because he had no light by which to see his controls after the displays failed, the pilot was forced to steer the plane blindly; as a result, the plane swerved off course and headed back out into the Atlantic. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that the ceiling started to melt.

The recovered [[attitude indicator|standby attitude indicator]] and [[airspeed indicator]] showed that the aircraft struck the water at 300 [[Knot (speed)|knots]] in a 20 degrees nose down and 110 degree bank turn, or almost upside down.
<ref>TSB 1.12.12, page 103, "[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/air/1998/a98h0003/01report/01factual/rep1_12_12.asp Aircraft Attitude and Airspeed at the Time of Impact]</ref> 
Upon impact, in less than a second, the plane would have been crushed, killing all aboard almost instantly.

The TSB concluded that even if they had been aware of the nature of the problem, the rate of spread of the fire would have precluded a safe landing at Halifax even if an approach had begun as soon as the "[[pan-pan]]" was declared.

===TSB Recommendations===
The TSB made nine recommendations relating to changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture. (Both flight recorders stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact.) General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training.  These recommendations have lead to widespread changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.

The lack of flight recorder data for the last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. The plane was broken into millions of small pieces by the impact, making this process time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the longest (five years) and most expensive (57 million CAD) transport accident investigation in Canadian history.

[[Image:Peggys Cove Swissair Flight 111.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial, [[Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia]]]]
Two memorials to the victims have been established by the government of Nova Scotia. One is located east of the crash site at The Whalesback, a [[Headlands and bays|promontory]] 1&nbsp;km north of [[Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia|Peggys Cove]]. The second memorial is a more private but much larger commemoration located west of the crash site near Bayswater Beach Provincial Park on the [[Aspotogan Peninsula]]. Here, the unidentified remains of the victims are interred.

In September 1999 Swissair and [[Boeing]] offered the families of the passengers full compensatory damages. This was rejected in favor of a $19.8 billion suit against Swissair and [[DuPont]], the supplier of [[Mylar]] insulation sheathing. The claim was rejected in a US federal court in February 2002.<ref>[http://www.rapoportlaw.com/index.cfm/fa/cases.detail/Case/d569e29c-d80a-4435-a406-79e14542f557/Over_13_Million_for_Victims_of_Swissair_Disaster.cfm Rapoport Law Offices] ''Over $13 Million for Victims of Swissair Disaster''.

A number of notable individuals died in this accident, including [[Jonathan Mann]], former head of the [[WHO]]'s [[AIDS]] program; Mann's wife,  AIDS researcher Mary-Lou Clements-Mann; Pierce J. Gerety Jr., [[UNHCR]] Director of  Operations for the [[Great Lakes Region of Africa]], who was on a special mission for U.N. Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to attempt to negotiate a peace accord with [[Laurent Kabila]] in an erupting regional war; and  [[Joseph LaMotta]], son of former [[boxing]] world champion [[Jake LaMotta]], <ref>[http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/Heritage/FSCNS/Scots_NS/Thr_Yrs/Flight_111/Passengers_Crew.html Chebucto Community Net] ''Passengers and Crew Members, Swiss Air Flight 111: [[2 September]] [[1998]]''.

Retrieved on [[November 24]], [[2006]].</ref> A number of works of art, including a piece by [[Pablo Picasso]], were lost in the crash.

After the crash, the flight route designator for Swissair's New York-Geneva route was changed to Flight 139.

Since the crash there have been many television documentaries on Flight 111, including episodes of disaster shows like [[History Channel]]'s [[Disasters of the Century]], [[National Geographic]]'s ''[[Air Crash Investigation]]'' and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'' [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/aircrash/]. ''NOVA'' created a classroom activity kit for teachers at schools using the crash as an example of an airplane crash investigation [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/pdf/3105_aircrash.pdf].

In May 2007 the TSB released copies of the audio recordings of the air traffic control transmissions associated with the flight. One of the pilots was reported to have spoken in a heavy Swiss-German accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cp.org/english/online/OnlineFullStory.aspx?filename=n052138A&newsitemid=26203019|accessdate=2007-05-25|author=Dean Beeby|title=Swissair recordings revive horrifying drama of deadly 1998 tragedy|work=Canadian Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/22/america/NA-GEN-Canada-Swissair-Crash.php|accessdate=2007-05-25|title=Swissair crash recordings revive drama of one of Canada's worst aviation disasters|date=[[2007-05-22]]}}</ref> The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's ''[[Access to Information Act]]'' and ''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]'', the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] rejected this argument in 2006, in a legal proceeding concerned with air traffic control recordings in four other air accidents.<ref>''[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2006/2006fca157/2006fca157.html Canada (Information Commissioner) v.
