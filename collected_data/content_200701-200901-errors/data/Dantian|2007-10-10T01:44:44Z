'''Dantian''' or '''Tan t'ien''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: '''Dāntián''' [[wiktionary:丹|丹]][[wiktionary:田|田]]; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: '''Tanden''' 丹田; [[Korean language|Korean]]: 단전''' DanJeon''' 丹田; [[Thai language|Thai]] '''Dantian''' ตันเถียน) which literally means "cinnabar or red field" and is loosely translated as "elixir field". It is described as an important focal point for internal meditative techniques and refers specifically to the physical [[center of gravity]] located in the abdomen three finger widths below and two finger widths behind the navel.  

The dantian is important in [[qigong]], [[neigong]], [[Tao Yin|tao yin]] and other breathing techniques, as well as for [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and is also widely used throughout [[East Asia]]n [[meditation]] and [[martial art]]s theory, especially the [[neijia]] school of [[Chinese martial arts]]. 

The dantian is sometimes divided into sections. The lower dantian (at the navel as described above) is associated with physical energy and sometimes sexuality. The middle dantian (at the [[solar plexus]]) deals with respiration and the health of [[internal organs]]. The upper dantian (at the [[third eye]]) relates to [[consciousness]] or intent, spirit or shen, and the brain.

In speaking specifically of the lower of the three points, the term dantian is often used interchangeably with the Japanese word '''hara''' (腹; Chinese: '''fù''') which literally means simply "belly". In [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese tradition, it is considered the physical center of gravity for the human body and by extension the seat of one's internal energy ([[qi]]). A master of [[calligraphy]], [[swordsmanship]], [[tea ceremony]], martial arts or comparable disciplines is held in the Japanese tradition to be "acting from the hara". The one-point (seika no itten, kikai tanden) is also a central element in [[Japan]]ese yoga, [[Ki-Aikido]], and other traditional arts.

[[Buddhist]] teachers often instruct their students to center their mind in dantian, held to aid control of [[thought]]s and [[emotion]]s. Therefore, acting from the dantian is considered to be related to the state of [[samadhi]]. 

The dantian also roughly corresponds to the [[India]]n concept of the [[manipura]], or third [[chakra]] in [[yoga]] philosophy, thought to be the seat of [[prana]] that radiates outwards to the entire body.
