Spears initially supported the policies of President Bush in a CNN interview in 2003 with conservative political pundit [[Tucker Carlson]]. However, her support was not due to politics; instead more to show patriotism. Carlson praised Spears for her support of the president, who was unpopular at that time among Hollywood entertainers.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/03/britney.spears/]</ref>

Spears released her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' in November 2003, jettisoning the [[Max Martin]]-produced [[synthpop]] of her earlier releases. The album took in lesser-known producers such as [[Christopher Stewart (music producer)|RedZone]] and big names including [[Moby]] and [[R. Kelly]]. Spears co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs and co-produced several pieces of her material for the first time. ''In the Zone'' reached number one in the U.S. charts during its debut week, selling over 609,000 copies. This made Spears the first female in the [[Nielsen SoundScan]] [[era]] to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.<ref name=inthezonestats>{{cite web | title=Britney Spears Sells 609,000 Copies Of 'In The Zone' | publisher=music.yahoo.com | url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/story/12064351 | date=December 1, 2003 | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref> The album had a mild reception from critics. [[Stylus Magazine]] gave the album a D and even blamed Spears's career choices by stating, "Ultimately, ''In the Zone'' suffers greatly from Britney's uneasy transition from teen tart to sexually powerful woman.

Spears is a [[soubrette]],<ref>http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Britney_Spears</ref> a type of [[soprano]] vocal part. Rami Yacoub, who co-produced Spears's debut album with its songwriter and lyricist Max Martin, commented, "I know from [[Denniz Pop]] and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice".<ref name="billboard book"/> Following the release of her debut album, Chuck Taylor of ''Billboard'' observed, "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice..."(You Drive Me) Crazy," her third single...demonstrates Spears's own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice".<ref>{{Citation |last=Taylor | first=Chuck | title=Britney Spears: (You Drive Me) Crazy | newspaper=Billboard |volume=111|issue=35| pages=27 | year=1999 | date=1999-08-28}}</ref> Spears later commented, "With [''...Baby One More Time''], I didn't get to show my voice off.

===Choreography===
Joan Anderman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' cited Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]] as two of Spears' biggest influences", commenting that Spears adopted Madonna's "Truth or Dare"-era moves" and Jackson's sexy-robot body language".<ref name="Anderman">{{Citation |last=Anderman | first=Joan | title=Britney Spears, Queen Of Teen, Earns Her Title In Glitzy Show | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | pages=D.1 | year=2000 | date=2000-08-29}}</ref> Judy Mitoma, author of ''Envisioning dance on film and video'' (2002) observed "[t]he music videos of the late 1990s and early 2000s enlist[ed] the popular dance vocabularies at the time...pounding feet into the floor and jabbing at the air with taunt arm movements, punctuating with bent knees and thrusting hips".<ref name="Envisioning">{{cite book | last = Mitoma | first = Judy | co-authors= Judith Mitoma, Elizabeth Zimmer, Dale Ann Stieber, Nelli Heinonen, Norah Zuňiga Shaw| title = Envisioning dance on film and video | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | pages = 19 | isbn = 0415941717}}</ref> Britney Spears, among her contemporaries, became a "playfully carnal, provocatively dressed vixen...led by Madonna (and the first time she grabbed her crotch) [and] fueled by Janet Jackson, transformed from a soft-fleshed, innocent girl to a buffed and buxom woman".<ref name="Envisioning"/> In the book ''Madonnastyle'' (2002) by Carol Clerk, Spears is quoted saying: "I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna...Her choreography definitely opened the door for girls to go in there and do their own thing".<ref>{{cite book | last = Clerk | first = Carol | title = Madonnastyle | publisher = Omnibus Press | year = 2002 | pages = 56 | isbn = 9780711988743}}</ref>

===Live performances===
Kevin Johnson of the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' reported that his review of Spear's concert performance of her [[Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour]] in July 2000, garnered mix reactions. He stated: "It was the review of Spears's concert that got most readers writing - to disagree and agree. A Spears fan wrote, "I don't like you or your stinking, horrible, abusive report! ... I, however, love Britney." Another fan wrote, "Britney Spears is a legend, a great performer. She is our idol and nothing you say about that concert will change that. It still hurts to think you didn't see how many people she touched that night. ... What I saw was hard work and determination, great dance moves, catchy lyrics, and positive songs".<ref name="St. Louis Post">{{Citation |last=Johnson |first=Kevin | title=Pop-Music Fans Have Their Say - And More | newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]| pages=19| year=2000 | date=2000-07-27|issn=19309600}}</ref> In contrast, Johnson also reported: "One reader said, "I was pleased the article was direct and told the simple truth: Britney can't sing. I attended the concert and had a great time, but unlike 95 percent of the crowd, I realized how ridiculous Britney Spears really is".<ref name="St. Louis Post"/> In August 2000, Joan Anderman wrote in her review of the concert, "Spears sang without the help of prerecorded tracks &mdash; that's both the good news and the bad news &mdash; avoiding the perils by having her two backup vocalists sing in unison with her much of the time, a wise move for someone whose vocal and emotional range are limited, and whose singing isn't even particularly appealing".<ref name="Anderman"/>

The following year, at the beginning of Spears's [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]], the ''[[Daily News]]'' reported: "Britney Spears is easy to criticize &mdash; those outfits, that coquette/ good-girl contradiction, those recycled pop hooks. But Tuesday night, surrounded by thousands of Britney devotees at the sold-out Arrowhead Pond of [[Anaheim]], she was easy to love as well...Because of all that dancing, thrashing and dodging fire on stage, Spears performed most of the show to a recorded track. It was hard to tell when she was really singing or just lip-syncing. But, in the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? Like a [[Las Vegas|Vegas]] revue show, you don't go to hear the music, you go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all".<ref>{{Citation | title=The Hype; Navel Maneuvers; Britney Spears, Fronting Her Own Career Now, Gives The Pond A Bellyful | newspaper=[[Daily News]] | pages=L.5| year=2001 | date=2001-11-22}}</ref> In December 2001, Sean Piccoli of ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' reported: "[Spears's] contributions to pop are not generally founded in music. Wednesday's spectacle was pop inspired not by songs, but by cheerleader tryouts and beauty pageants. The point was not whether Spears could sing &mdash; her voice is a very small bag of heavy-breathing tricks &mdash; or even dance. What mattered was how she presents...By that standard, the show was a success. Spears had the biggest runway a girl could ask for and made good use of it, ensuring that every person from the floor to the nosebleed seats could see her fling her hair, swivel her hips or, in one sequence that was almost eerie, dance with a video projection of herself".<ref>{{Citation |last= Piccoli |first=Sean | title=All Sparkle, No Substance; Show's Merely A Spectacle | newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]| pages=26.A| year=2001 | date=2001-12-20}}</ref>

In March 2007, Leonard Pitts, Jr. wrote that in the aftermath of Spears' personal struggles that have become widely publicized, Spears had been reduced to an abstract idea as opposed to being regarded as a real person.<ref name="Pitts">{{Citation |last= Pitts | first= Leonard | title=Britney's cry for help is no laughing matter | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]| pages=15 | year=2007 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/18310562/cover_story_the_tragedy_of_britney_spears| date=2007-03-13|issn=10856706}}</ref> "The abstraction is not surprising: Whatever media touch, they objectify... What must it be like to have your marriage and divorce, your relationship with your parents and kids... dissected by millions of strangers who think they know you?"<ref name="Pitts"/> Pitts further commented that fame and fortune do not qualify the media scrutiny Spears has faced, but observed that fact has been overlooked by "our rush to a day of [[reality television|'reality' television]]" and "[[tabloid journalism]]".<ref name="Pitts"/> Though "[t]here is no reverence, no privacy, [and] nothing held back as sacred", Pitts argues "Britney Jean Spears is not an idea."<ref name="Pitts"/>

==Legacy==
Britney Spears became a [[pop icon|pop culture icon]] immediately after launching her recording career. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine wrote: "One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century," she "spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank".<ref>{{cite web | title = Britney Spears: Biography: Rolling Stone | publisher = ''Rolling Stone'' | year = 2008 | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/britneyspears/biography | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}</ref> She is listed by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as having the "Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist" for her debut album ''...Baby One More Time'' which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite book | last = Folkard | first = Claire | title = Guinness World Records 2003 | publisher = Bantam Books | year = 2003 | pages = 288 | isbn = 9780553586367}}</ref> Melissa Ruggieri of the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'' reported, "She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist.

Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouskateer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena &mdash; a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry".<ref>{{Citation |last= Ellen | first=Barbara | title=Comment: Britney Spears: Growing up is hard to do: America's apple- pie cheerleader is feeling the pressure as she tries to break free from her clean teen image.
