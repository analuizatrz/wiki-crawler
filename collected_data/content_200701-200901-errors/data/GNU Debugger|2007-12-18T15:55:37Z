The '''GNU Debugger''', usually called just '''GDB''', is the standard [[debugger]] for the [[GNU]] software system. It is a portable debugger that runs on many [[Unix-like]] systems and works for many [[programming language]]s, including [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[FreeBASIC]], and [[Fortran programming language|Fortran]].

==History==
GDB was first written by [[Richard Stallman]] in [[1986]] as part of his [[GNU]] system, after his [[GNU Emacs]] was "reasonably stable".<ref>{{cite web

 |      quote = Then after GNU Emacs was reasonably stable, which took all in all about a year and a half, I started getting back to other parts of the system. I developed a debugger which I called GDB which is a symbolic debugger for C code, which recently entered distribution. Now this debugger is to a large extent in the spirit of DBX, which is a debugger that comes with Berkeley Unix.
}}</ref> GDB is [[free software]] released under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). It was modeled after the [[Dbx debugger]], which came with [[BSD| Berkeley Unix]] distributions.

From 1990 to 1993 it was maintained by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] while he worked for [[Cygnus Solutions]].

==Technical details==
===Features===
GDB offers extensive facilities for tracing and altering the execution of [[computer program]]s. The user can monitor and modify the values of programs' internal [[variable]]s, and even call [[function (programming)|functions]] independently of the program's normal behavior.

GDB target processors (as of [[2003]]) include:
[[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[Atmel AVR|AVR]], [[Hitachi H8|H8/300]], [[System/370]], [[System 390]], [[X86]] and [[X86-64]], [[Itanium|IA-64]] "Itanium", [[Motorola 68000]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PA-RISC]], [[PowerPC]], [[SuperH]], [[SPARC]], and [[VAX]].

Lesser-known target processors supported in the standard release have included [[A29K]], [[Advanced RISC Computing|ARC]], [[CRIS]], [[D10V]], [[D30V]], [[FR-30]], [[FR-V]], [[Intel i960]], [[M32R]], [[Motorola 68HC11|68HC11]], [[Motorola 88000]], [[MCORE]], [[MN10200]], [[MN10300]], [[320xx microprocessor|NS32K]], [[Stormy16]], [[V850]], and [[Zilog Z8000|Z8000]].  (Newer releases will likely not support some of these.)

GDB has compiled-in [[Instruction Set Simulator|simulators]] for target processors even for lesser-known target processors such like M32R or V850.

GDB is still actively developed.  As of early 2007, the focus is on adding "reversible debugging" support<ref>{{cite web
 |      title = GDB and Reversible Debugging
 |        url = http://sourceware.org/gdb/news/reversible.html
 | accessdate = 2007-03-01
 |      quote = Reversible debugging (the ability to "step backwards" through a program) is an obviously powerful tool. GDB does not support it today, but the foundations have been laid, and the GDB maintainers are looking for contributors interested in expanding those foundations.
 }}</ref> &mdash; allowing a debugging session to step backwards, much like rewinding a crashed program to see what happened. Adding reversible debugging is one of the [[High Priority Free Software Projects]].

===Remote debugging===
GDB offers a 'remote' mode often used when debugging embedded systems. Remote operation is when GDB runs on one machine and the program being debugged runs on another. GDB can communicate to the remote 'stub' which understands GDB protocol via Serial or TCP/IP.

The same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running [[Linux kernel]] on the source level with gdb. With kgdb, kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs. It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code, step through the code and observe variables. On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available, watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed. kgdb requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a [[serial cable]] or [[ethernet]]. On [[FreeBSD]], it is also possible to debug using [[Firewire]] [[Direct memory access|DMA]].

===Limitations===
The debugger does not contain its own [[graphical user interface]], and defaults to a [[command-line interface]]. Several front-ends have been built for it, such as [[Data Display Debugger|DDD]], [[List of Eclipse projects#Tools projects|Eclipse CDT]], [[Xcode]] debugger, GDBtk/[http://sources.redhat.com/insight/ Insight] and the "GUD mode" in [[GNU Emacs]]. These offer facilities similar to debuggers found in [[integrated development environment]]s.

GDB does not correctly support C++ templates. <ref>{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2007-06-08

Some other debugging tools have been designed to work with GDB, such as [[memory leak]] detectors.
