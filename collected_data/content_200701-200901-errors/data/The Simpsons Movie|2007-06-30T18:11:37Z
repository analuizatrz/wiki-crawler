Little information on the plot has been released: [[Matt Groening]] noted, "I can't imagine people look in the TV section of the newspaper and think, 'I'll watch this week's ''Simpsons'' because I like the plot.' You just tune in and see what happens."<ref name="empire"/> ''[[Newsweek]]'' revealed several plot details based on footage that they were shown. Early on in the film, after he has been dared by Homer, Bart will skateboard through Springfield naked, eventually going "full-frontal". The film begins with a "growing environmental crisis" to which Homer adds. [[Albert Brooks]] plays a character attempting to take over the world, and Lisa "may" get a boyfriend who is a green-activist.<ref name=newsweek>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18237345/site/newsweek/|title=Homer's Big-Screen Odyssey|author=Smith, Sean|accessdate=2007-05-08|date=[[2007-04-21]]|publisher=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref>

==Production==
===Development===
The production staff of ''The Simpsons'' had entertained the thought of a film since early in the series, but things never came together. The [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season 4]] episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]" was originally going to be a film, but difficulties were encountered in writing a movie length script, at which point the movie plans were dropped in favor of a [[season premiere]].<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mark Kirkland, David Silverman|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> For a long time the project was held up. There was trouble finding a story that was right for a film, and the crew did not have enough time to complete a film project, as they already worked full time year-round on the show.<ref name="avclub">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/3|title=Matt Groening interview with The A.V.

The idea was not done as it was be difficult to write an hour and a half long script.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Streetcar Named Marge]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Before his death, [[Phil Hartman]] had always wanted to create a [[live action]] [[Troy McClure]] film, with several of the staff saying that they would have loved to help create it.<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homerpalooza]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards and did not cease. James L. Brooks said on the matter that the "fact that we could say no meant that we never had to."<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/movies/moviesspecial/06itzk.html | title = D'oh!

The film was originally planned for release in summer 2006,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/4246.html|title=A Simpsons Movie in 2006?|accessdate=2007-05-07|date=[[2004-02-11]]|publisher=ICV2.com}}</ref> but [[Al Jean]] stated at San Diego's [[Comic Con International]] 2004 that the producers were taking their time, to make sure that the film was perfect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/5380.html|title=Simpsons Film Confirmed|accessdate=2007-05-07|date=2006-07-04|publisher=ICV2.com}}</ref> In 2005, Nancy Cartwright told [[BBC Radio 1]] that the cast had done their first table reading.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=9902|title=Nancy Cartwright on The Simpsons Movie|accessdate=2007-05-07|date=[[2005-06-05]]|publisher=comingsoon.net}}</ref> It was not until [[April 1]] [[2006]] that Twentieth Century Fox confirmed that ''The Simpsons'' was to be made into a feature-length film, to be released [[July 27]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4867252.stm|title=Simpsons film confirmed for 2007|accessdate=2007-05-07|date=[[2006-04-01]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

===Animation===
[[Image:simpsons angry mob.png|right|thumb|300px|An angry mob of townspeople come looking for Homer.]]
The film is being animated in a wider [[anamorphic format|2.39:1]] aspect ratio, and colored with the largest palette the animators have ever had available to them. The technique of animating the characters to have shadows is used throughout the film.<ref name=nytimes/> On the subject of animation, David Silverman said that "In any given episode, there will be sequences you really want to lavish your attention on, and you've got to pick and choose" leading him to think that it "would be really great if we could lavish that attention with every single scene [in the film] that we do".<ref name=nytimes/> As inspiration for the animation, Silverman and his team of animators looked at ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Triplets of Belleville]]'' and ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'', calling them "a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed".<ref name=nytimes/>

Although most animated films can not make any changes to the story for budget reasons,<ref name="empire"/> ''The Simpsons Movie'' crew continued to keep playing with their film even into 2007. [[James L. Brooks]] noted, "We saw a trailer the other day, and somebody said 70 percent of the things in it — based on where we were eight weeks ago — are no longer in the movie, because we keep on fooling around."<ref name=ew>{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20035330,00.html | title = Inside 'The Simpsons Movie' | accessdate = 2007-05-05 | author = Dan Snierson | date = [[2007-04-27]] | work = Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>

===Casting===
As inspiration for the crowd scene in the film, the production staff spent a long time looking at the ''Simpsons'' poster that features over 320 of the show's characters. Groening said that they did try to put every single character into the film, with 94 having speaking parts.<ref name=ew>{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20035330,00.html | title = Inside 'The Simpsons Movie' | accessdate = 2007-05-05 | author = Dan Snierson | date = [[2007-04-27]] | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> The series regulars [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright (actress)|Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]] and [[Harry Shearer]] and a majority of the show's semi-regular performers [[Marcia Wallace]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Russi Taylor]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Maggie Roswell]] reprised their roles for the film.<ref name=variety/> [[Kelsey Grammer]] also returned for [[Sideshow Bob]]<ref name="iesb">{{cite news|url=http://www.iesb.net/fox2006/051206d.php|title=Interview: Kelsey Grammer On the Beast PLUS Sideshow Bob Is In The Simpsons Movie!|publisher=IESB.net|date=[[2006-05-12]]|accessdate=2007-05-08|author=Stephanie Sanchez}}</ref> as did [[Joe Mantegna]] for [[Fat Tony]].<ref name="creators">{{cite news|url=http://www.creators.com/lifestylefeatures/hollywood-exclusive/jon-cryer-and-lisa-joyner-plan-june-wedding-joe-mantegna-pulls-eclectic-string-of-roles.html|title=Jon Cryer and Lisa Joyner Plan June Wedding/Joe Mantegna Pulls Eclectic String of Roles|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=creators.com}}</ref>

Various new characters were also created along the way, who were often written out as they didn't contribute much.<ref name="empire"/> [[Albert Brooks]], who has supplied many guest voices in episodes, will be playing the "villain",<ref name=newsweek/> and [[Isla Fisher]] will also voice a character.<ref>{{cite news|author=Wolf, Jeanne |title=What Creeps Out Borat's Future Wife? |url=http://movies.go.com/moviesproxy/jeannewolf?columnid=883936|publisher=movies.com|date=[[2007-03-29]]|accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> Among those playing themselves are [[Erin Brockovich]],<ref name="usa"/> and [[Green Day]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1559169/20070509/story.jhtml|title='Simpsons Movie' Cast Discusses Green Day's Appearance In Film|accessdate=2007-05-10|author=James Montgomery|date=[[2007-05-09]]|publisher=MTV}}</ref> and in an example of the film's ever morphing storyline, [[Minnie Driver]] recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that was cut.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1558514/20070501/story.jhtml|title=Movie File: 'Dark Knight,' Christian Bale, 'Simpsons Movie' & More|accessdate=2007-05-08|author=Adler, Shawn; Carroll, Larry|date=[[2007-05-02]]|publisher=MTV}}</ref>
