'''St John's College, Woodlawn''' is a Catholic systemic secondary school, located in the rural area of "Woodlawn" on the outskirts of [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].<br />

In the city of Lismore the four largest industries by employment are; retail sector, health care, education and agriculture. St John's College, originally an agricultural secondary school, has a major part in two of these sectors and of course participates indirectly in the others as well.<br />

The school's name is often shortened to "Woodlawn" rather than being named fully. After 75 years the name is a source of pride and honour throughout the local and educational communities. The School was founded by the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]] who continue to play a role in the running of the school. The first lay Rector (Principal) is Glenn Roff who holds the role currently.

== History ==
St John's College, Woodlawn, was founded from [[St Patrick's College, Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] in [[1931]].  The Marists who began the school themselves originated in [[France]] in the early 19th century. <br />
St John's College was '''formally opened in 1931''' as a Boarding and Day school on land which was donated by Miss Margaret Buckley. The first Rector of the school was Fr Thomas Segrief S.M, Followed by Frs James Bell,  John Kennedy,  John Webber, Steven Maloney, Sid Mitchell, John Webber, Garry Reynolds, Lou Molloy, John Worthington, William Ryder, Ray Chapman - all priests of the Society of Mary and the current Principal is Mr Glenn Roff.

'''The College was described in the Northern Star on May 25th 1931;<br />'''
''"St John's Educational and Agricultural College at Woodlawn, on the outskirts of Lismore, and architectural jewel adorning the pastoral diadem of the North Coast, is destined to make history throughout all States of the [[Commonwealth]]. Its inspiration is eloquent tribute to the zeal, enthusiasm and practical outlook of that order of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Marist Fathers."''
          
=== The 75th Anniversary ===
St John's College Woodlawn celebrated its '''75th Anniversary''' in 2006. The College held many events throughout the year to celebrate, ranging from the first "Woodlawn Race Day", to "St John's Youth Day" and formal ceremonies. The opening of the renovated Chapel was a central part of the ceremonies, with hundreds of Alumni returning to be apart of the celebrations. After the Woodlawn Race Day (also known as the Woodlawn Cup), the College executive in association with the Parents and Friends executive decided to hold the day annually.

==The Ethos and Spirit of the College==
=== Mission Statement===
''St John's College, Woodlawn builds on its traditions as a welcoming family, based on the [[Catholic]] faith, and aims for its members to be touched by a Christian spirituality. 
Through inspired leadership, we endeavour to assist all our community to achieve their full potential. We aim to provide an [[education]] which is relevant to the 21st century, based on a harmony of the physical, academic, cultural and spiritual.''

===The College's Motto===
''"Tenete Traditiones"'', is taken from [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'s second letter to the [[Thessalonians]]: "God called you to this through the Good News we preached to you; He called you to possess your share of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, our brothers, stand firm and '''hold fast to the traditions''' which we taught you, both in our preaching and our writing". (2 Thessalonians 2:14-15)

===The College's Crest===
St John's College Woodlawn's crest shows the three colours of Woodlawn (Red, Green and Gold), and also St John's Eagle in the upper right corner, with the Society of Mary's symbol shown in the lower left corner. With ''Tenete Traditiones'' below this completes the image of the holistic parts of the college.

===The College Patron===
St John's College ''Woodlawn is named after [[St John the Evangelist]]''. St John was one of the twelve apostles and tradition tells us that he was a close friend of Jesus. We celebrate his feast day at the beginning of the academic year. As John's gospel is said to provide a view of the life of Jesus from high above St John's symbol is the Eagle and therefore the eagle is held as an important symbol for the college. 'The [[Eagle]]' is also the title of the College annual magazine.

== Significant Days at Woodlawn ==
==='''Opening Mass'''<br />===
The Opening Mass is the spiritual event marking the start of the new year. In recent years the Opening Mass has been held at the Lismore Cathedral to allow the entire school to attend and to include the Diocese in the events of the College. The Opening Mass also celebrates the new leaders in the College, the Prefects receive their badges of office; and the newly appointed [[Students' Representative Council]] is inducted for the year.<br />
===College Swimming Carnival===
[[Image:Woodlawn Swimming Carnival.jpg|right|256px|thumb|Woodlawn Swimming Carnival; at Night with its great atmosphere.]]
Is respected as being the most exciting, engaged and fun night of the college, it its known as the best swimming carnival in the Northern Rivers and is the first event for the new year 12 to engage its new responsibilities. Some of the Colleges most significant moments have occurred in or at the pool, and is quickly becoming the event not to miss.<br />
==='''College Cross Country'''<br />=== 
The course varies between 3 and 3.5 Kilometres depending on year level and gender and also the time to beat varies, ranging from 30 to 40 minutes to earn extra points. The Cross Country is run over the rolling hills nearby and is notoriously easy to walk yet very challenging to run.

==='''Yr 12 Youth Day''' / '''St John's Day'''<br />===
St John's day has recently been combined with the college youth day to become "St John's Youth Day" and is the event where Yr 12 takes control and has some fun with half the day dedicated to fun activities designed by Year 12's for the rest of the college to enjoy. The profits made from the events go back through the school in the fashion of the Year 12 gift at the end of their years.<br />
