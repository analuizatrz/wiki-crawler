The '''Las Vegas Strip''' (also known as '''The Strip''') is an approximately 4 mile (6.4 km) section of [[Las Vegas Boulevard|Las Vegas Boulevard South]] in the [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] and [[Winchester, Nevada|Winchester]] areas [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], [[Nevada]], [[United States]], south of the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] city limits. Most of "The Strip" has been designated an [[National Scenic Byway|All-American Road]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=U.S. Transportation Deputy Secretary Downey Announces New All-American Roads, National Scenic Byways in 20 States |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date=2000-06-15 |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pressroom/fhwa0042.htm |format= |language= |accessdate=2008-06-22 |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Las Vegas Strip Named All-American Road |publisher= |date= |url=http://travelnevada.com/press_detail.asp?PressID=24 |format= |language= |accessdate=2008-06-22 |quote= }}</ref>

Many of the largest [[hotel]], [[casino]] and [[resort]] properties in the world are located on The Strip. Eighteen of the world's twenty five largest hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 67,000 rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/largesthotels.htm |title=The 24 Largest Hotels in the World |accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref><ref name="hiltonFootnote">  One of the 19, the [[Las Vegas Hilton]], is an "off-Strip" property but is located less than 0.5 miles (0.8 km) east of the Strip.</ref>

Over the years, Las Vegas Boulevard South has been called [[Arrowhead Highway]], or ''Los Angeles Highway''. The Strip was reportedly named by [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[police officer]] Guy McAfee, after his hometown's [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lasvegas/peopleevents/p_mcafee.html |title=Las Vegas: An Unconventional History |accessdate=2007-06-07 |format= |work= [[American Experience]]}}</ref>

One of the most visible aspects of Las Vegas' cityscape is its use of dramatic themes. The theming of hotels, casinos, and restaurants on the Strip has established the city as one of the most popular destinations for tourists. <ref>{{cite book |title= “Theming as a Sensory Phenomenon: Discovering the Senses on the Las Vegas Strip,” in The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self, |last= Lukas |first=Scott A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= Lexington Books, 2007 |location= |isbn= 0739121421 |pages=75-95 |editor=Scott A.

[[Image:Roadtrip 02 bg 041506.jpg|thumb|right|A similar view of the Strip at night]]
In the strictest sense, "the Strip" refers only to Las Vegas Boulevard, roughly between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road, a distance of {{convert|4.1|mi|km}}. However, the term is often used to refer not only to the road but also to the various casinos and resorts that line the road, and even to properties which are not on the road but in proximity. Certain government agencies, such as the [[Nevada Gaming Commission]], classify properties as "Las Vegas Strip" for reporting purposes, although these definitions can include properties which are {{convert|1|mi|km}} or more away from Las Vegas Boulevard (such as the [[Hard Rock Hotel & Casino]]). Phrases such as ''Strip Area'', ''Resort Corridor'' or ''Resort District'' are sometimes used to indicate a larger geographical area.

The [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|Stratosphere]], situated {{convert|0.25|mi|km}} north of Sahara, is often included in the Resort Corridor. At one time, the southern end of the Corridor was considered to end at Tropicana Avenue, but continuing construction has extended this, first to Russell Road, then to Sunset Road and now all the way to I-215. [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino|Mandalay Bay]] is located just north of Russell Road, with the [[Bali Hai Golf Club]] located just south of Russell Road. Town Square, a substantial new shopping development, is situated in the last remaining space north of [[I-215]].{{fact|date=January 2008}}

Because of the number and size of the resorts, the Resort Corridor can be quite wide. [[Interstate 15 (Nevada)|Interstate 15]] runs roughly parallel and 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) to the west of Las Vegas Boulevard for the entire length of the Strip. Paradise Road runs to the east in a similar fashion, and ends at East St. Louis Avenue. The eastern side of the Strip is bounded by [[McCarran International Airport|McCarran Airport]] south of Tropicana Avenue. North of this point, the Resort Corridor can be considered to extend as far east as Paradise Road, although some consider Koval Lane as a less inclusive boundary. Interstate 15 is sometimes considered the western edge of the Resort Corridor from Interstate 215 to Spring Mountain Road. North of this point, Industrial Road serves as the western edge. Some resorts such as [[Rio Hotel & Casino|The Rio]] and the [[Palms Casino Resort|The Palms]] are actually west of Interstate 15, so a more inclusive definition might extend west to Valley View Boulevard or Arville Street.{{fact|date=January 2008}}

The famous [[Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign]] is located in the median just south of Russell Road, across from the now-defunct [[Klondike Hotel & Casino]]; another similar sign is in the median at the north end of the Strip near the intersection of east St. Louis and south Main Streets.

==History==
The first casino to be built on Highway 91 was the ''Pair-o-Dice Club'' in 1931; the first on what is today's Strip was the [[El Rancho Vegas]], opening on [[April 3]] [[1941]] with 63 rooms and standing for almost 20 years before being destroyed by fire in 1960. Its success spawned a second hotel on what would become The Strip, the [[Hotel Last Frontier]], in 1942. The [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]] opened a few years later, on [[December 26]] [[1946]].

In 1968, [[Kirk Kerkorian]] purchased the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]] and hired Sahara Hotels Vice President Alex Shoofey as President. Alex Shoofey brought along 33 of Sahara's top executives. The Flamingo was used to train future employees of the International Hotel, which was under construction. Opening in 1969, the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]], with 1,512 rooms, became the largest hotel in the world, and began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] today.

The first [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], also a Kerkorian property, opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. At the time, this was the largest hotel in the world by number of rooms. On [[November 21]] [[1980]], the MGM Grand suffered the worst resort fire in the history of Las Vegas, killing 87 people as a result of electrical problems. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to Bally Manufacturing, and it was renamed [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's]].

The [[Wet 'n Wild]] water park opened in 1985 and was located on the south side of the Sahara hotel. The park closed at the end of the 2004 season and was later demolished.

[[Image:Las Vegas by Night.jpg|thumb|left|Las Vegas Strip at night with the Aladdin (Now Planet Hollywood)]]
The opening of [[The Mirage]] in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts. These huge facilities offer [[entertainment]] and [[restaurant|dining]] options, as well as gambling and lodging. This change impacted the smaller, well-known and now historic hotels and casinos, like [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|The Dunes]], [[Sands Hotel|The Sands]] and the [[Stardust Hotel|Stardust]].

In 1995, following the death of [[Dean Martin]], the lights along the strip were dimmed in a sign of respect to him. In 2005, Clark County renamed a section of Industrial Road (south of Twain Avenue) as Dean Martin Drive, also as a tribute to the famous [[Rat Pack]] singer, actor, and frequent Las Vegas entertainer.

In an effort to attract families, resorts offered more attractions geared toward youth, but had limited success. The (current) [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] opened in 1993 with [[MGM_Grand_Adventures_Theme_Park|Grand Adventures]] [[amusement park]], but the park closed in 2000 due to lack of interest. Similarly, in 2003 [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino|Treasure Island]] closed its own [[video arcade]] and abandoned the previous [[pirate]] theme, adopting the new ''ti'' name.<ref>{{cite press |url= http://www.treasureisland.com/pages/pressroom_102407i.asp |title=Treasure Island Show Symbolizes New Era for Strip Resort |accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref>
[[Image:Las Vegas Strip (view North from Tropicana intersection).jpg|thumb|right|View of the Strip, looking north from the [[Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection|Tropicana intersection]]]]
Downtown Las Vegas hotels and casinos suffered heavily from the Strip's boom. They have funneled money into remodeling the [[facade]]s of casinos, adding additional security and new attractions, like the [[Fremont Street Experience]] and [[Neonopolis]] (complete with movie theaters).{{fact|date=January 2008}}

In addition to the large hotels, casinos and resorts, The Strip is home to a few smaller casinos, [[motel]]s and other attractions, such as [[M&M World]], [[Adventuredome]] and the [[Fashion Show Mall]]. Starting in the mid-1990s, The Strip became a popular [[New Year's Eve]] celebration destination.

In 2004, [[MGM Mirage]] announced plans for ''[[Project CityCenter]]'', a 66-acre (600,000 m²), $7 billion multi-use project on the site of the Boardwalk hotel and adjoining land. It will consist of hotel, casino, condo, retail and other uses on the site. When completed, City Center will be the largest such complex in the world.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Construction began in April 2006, and the first elements of this project are expected to be available in 2009.

In 2006, the Las Vegas Strip lost its longtime status as the world's highest-grossing gambling center, falling to second place behind [[Macau]].<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last= Barboza |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Asian Rival Moves Past Las Vegas |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/business/worldbusiness/24Macao.html?ex=1327294800&en=150850fd9370148a&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |work= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2007-01-24 |accessdate= }}</ref>

===Transportation===
While not on The Strip itself, the [[Las Vegas Monorail]] runs on the east side of The Strip from Tropicana Avenue to Sahara Road.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:The deuce CAT ticket.jpg|thumb|right|A 24-hour pass for [[The Deuce]] bus costs $5]] -->
[[Citizens Area Transit|CAT Bus]] provides service on the strip with double decker buses known as [[The Deuce]]. The Deuce stops at most major resorts and continues north to downtown and the Fremont Street Experience. A current [http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/fares_passes.cfm list of fares] is available.

A tourist trolley service travels up and down The Strip and stops at various, but not all, Strip hotels, along with a stop at the Fashion Show Mall. The fare is $2.00 for a one way ride, regardless how far you travel down the strip. Alternatively, a 24-hour pass is $5, and exact change is required. Trolleys are scheduled to arrive every 15 minutes.

Two small, free cable-pulled [[tram]]s operate on the Strip. One runs between Treasure Island and The Mirage, while the other provides service to [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino|Mandalay Bay]], [[Luxor Hotel|Luxor]], and [[Excalibur Hotel and Casino|Excalibur]].

Taxis can only stop at hotel entrances or designated spots, so when planning to get somewhere ask which is the closest hotel.

Before CAT Bus came on in 1992, mass transit on the Strip was provided by a private transit company, [[Las Vegas Transit]]. The Strip route was their only profitable route and supported the whole bus system.{{fact|date=January 2008}}

===Free shuttles===
[[Image:LVBlvdRushHourDec2005.JPG|thumb|right|Las Vegas Blvd. traffic during the day]]
Some of the shuttles have a policy requiring a room key from an affiliated casino. Enforcement of these policies may vary.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.goingtovegas.com/kpv-get.htm |title=Shuttles |accessdate=2008-02-11 |format= |work= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orleanscasino.com/things-to-do/shuttle-service |title= Shuttle Service|accessdate=2008-02-11 |format= |work= }}</ref>

===Walking around===
[[Image:Las Vegas 028.JPG|thumb|right|Las Vegas Strip at Sands Road]]
Several Strip hotels have undertaken efforts to make the street more pedestrian-friendly. New casinos design their [[façade]]s to attract walk-up customers, and many of these entrances have become attractions themselves - the Fountains at [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]], the volcano at [[The Mirage]], and the [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino|Treasure Island]]. Spectators gather on the sidewalks in front of the casinos to watch these shows.

To alleviate traffic issues at popular intersections, several footbridges have been installed to help pedestrians safely traverse the roads. The [[Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection|Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard]] footbridges were the first to be installed, and based on the success of this project additional footbridges have been built on Las Vegas Boulevard at the Flamingo Road intersection; between The Mirage/Treasure Island and The Venetian; and the latest ones at the Las Vegas Boulevard-Spring Mountain and Sands Avenue intersection connecting the Wynn with the Fashion Show Mall and [[The Palazzo]].

===Golf courses===
In recent years, all but one of the on-Strip [[golf course]]s (the Desert Inn Golf Course) have fallen prey to the mega-resorts' need for land and have closed. Developer [[Steve Wynn (developer)|Steve Wynn]], founder of previously owned [[Mirage Resorts]], purchased the Desert Inn and golf course for his new company [[Wynn Resorts Limited|Wynn Resorts]]. In 2005, he opened [[Wynn Las Vegas]], complete with remodeled golf course providing tee times to hotel guests only.

In 2000, [[Bali Hai Golf Club]] opened just south of Mandalay Bay and the Strip. Catering to a high-end golf enthusiast, the Bali Hai Golf Course can easily be seen by drivers on [[Interstate 15 (Nevada)|Interstate 15]].
