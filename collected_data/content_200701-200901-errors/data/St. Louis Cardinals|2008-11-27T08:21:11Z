{{For|the National Football League team that played in St. Louis from 1960 to 1987|Arizona Cardinals}}

The '''St. Louis Cardinals''' (also referred to as "the '''Cards'''" or "the '''Redbirds'''") are a professional [[baseball]] team based in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. They are members of the [[National League Central|Central Division]] in the [[National League]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. The Cardinals have won a [[National League]] record 10 [[World Series]] championships, second only to the [[New York Yankees]] in Major League Baseball who have 26.

The Cardinals were founded in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in 1882 as the St. Louis Brown Stockings, taking the name from [[St. Louis Brown Stockings|an earlier National League team]]. They joined the National League in 1892 and have been known as the Cardinals since 1900. The Cardinals began play in the current [[Busch Stadium]] in 2006, becoming the first team since 1923 to win the World Series in their first season in a new ballpark. They are the oldest current professional sports franchise west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. The Cardinals have a [[Cardinals-Cubs rivalry|strong rivalry]] with the [[Chicago Cubs]] that began in 1885.

==History==
{{main|History of the St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals seasons}}

===1880s&ndash;1930s===
The Cardinals were founded in [[1882 in baseball|1882]] as a member of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] called the St. Louis Brown Stockings. The club quickly achieved success, winning four AA pennants in a row, 1885-1888. Following these titles, St. Louis played in an early version of the [[World_Series#Champions_prior_to_and_precursors_to_the_modern_World_Series_.281857-1902.29|World Series]], the first two times against the [[National League]]'s Chicago White Stockings (now the [[Chicago Cubs]]). The 1885 series ended in dispute, but St. Louis won the 1886 series outright, beginning a [[Cardinals-Cubs rivalry|St. Louis-Chicago rivalry]] that continues today.<ref> Jon David Cash, ''Before They Were Cardinals: Major League Baseball in Nineteenth-Century St. Louis.'' University of Missouri Press 2002</ref> The American Association went bankrupt in [[1892 in baseball|1892]], and the Browns moved to the National League, leaving much of their success behind for the next three decades. The club changed its name to the "Perfectos" in [[1899 in baseball|1899]], before adopting the "Cardinals" name in [[1900 in baseball|1900]].<ref name="Timeline1">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline1.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 1 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=6 March | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
[[Image:Rogers Hornsby.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Rogers Hornsby]] won two Triple Crowns with the Cardinals.]]
The Cardinals' fortunes in the National League began to improve in [[1920 in baseball|1920]], when [[Sam Breadon]] bought the club and named [[Branch Rickey]] his [[General_manager#Sports_teams|general manager]]. Rickey immediately moved the Cardinals to [[Sportsman's Park]] to become tenants of their [[American League]] rivals, the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]], and sold the Cardinals' [[Robison Field|ballpark]]. Rickey used the money from the sale to invest in and pioneer the [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] [[Farm team|farm system]], which produced many great players and led to new success for the Cardinals.<ref  name="Timeline2">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline2.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 2 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=6 March | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Led by [[Rogers Hornsby]], who won the [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] in [[1922 in baseball|1922]] and [[1925 in baseball|1925]], the Cardinals improved drastically during the 1920s. They won their first National League pennant in [[1926 in baseball|1926]] and then defeated the favored [[New York Yankees]] in seven games to win the [[1926 World Series|World Series]]. In [[1927 in baseball|1927]], now led by [[Frankie Frisch]], the Cardinals fell just short, before claiming another pennant in [[1928 in baseball|1928]]. The Yankees avenged their 1926 loss, however, by sweeping the Cardinals in four games in the [[1928 World Series|World Series]].

The Cardinals kept winning in the next decade, claiming back-to-back pennants in [[1930 in baseball|1930]] and [[1931 in baseball|1931]]. The Cardinals matched up with the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] in both World Series, losing in [[1930 World Series|1930]] but returning to win the [[1931 World Series|1931 series]]. In [[1934 in baseball|1934]] the team, nicknamed the [[Gashouse Gang|"Gashouse Gang"]] for their shabby appearance and rough tactics, again won the pennant and then the [[1934 World Series|World Series]] over the [[Detroit Tigers]]. [[Dizzy Dean]] won 30 games that season, the last National League pitcher to reach that mark. [[Joe Medwick]] won the [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] in [[1937 in baseball|1937]], the last National League hitter to achieve the feat, but the Cardinals failed to win a pennant in the second half of the decade.<ref name="Timeline3">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline3.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 3 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=7 May | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===1940s&ndash;1970s===
Outfielder [[Stan Musial|Stan "the Man" Musial]] joined the Cardinals in 1941. Known to loyal fans as "Ol' Number 6," Musial spent 22 years in a Cardinals uniform and won three [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|NL MVP Awards]]. In 1968 a statue of Musial was placed outside Busch Stadium to honor his career. 

During [[World War II]] the Cardinals dominated the National League, winning three straight pennants from 1942&ndash;1944. The [[1942 in baseball|1942]] "St. Louis Swifties" won a franchise record 106 games and defeated the Yankees in the [[1942 World Series|World Series]]. The team then posted the second-best records in team history with 105 wins in both [[1943 in baseball|1943]] and [[1944 in baseball|1944]]. The Cardinals fell to the Yankees in the [[1943 World Series]] rematch. The [[1944 World Series]] was particularly memorable, as the Cardinals met their crosstown rivals, the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]], in the "[[Tram|Streetcar]] Series," with the Cardinals prevailing for their fifth title. 

In [[1946 in baseball|1946]] the Cardinals finished the season tied with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], but claimed the pennant in a 3-game playoff series. The Cardinals then won the [[1946 World Series|World Series]] in 7 games against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. In the bottom of the 8th inning in Game 7, with the score tied at 3&ndash;3, [[Enos Slaughter]] scored on a "[[Slaughter's Mad Dash|Mad Dash]]" from first on a double to left-center to win the game and the series.<ref name="Timeline3" />

Rickey had left the Cardinals to become general manager of the Dodgers in 1942, and after their 1946 win, the Cardinals slid back to the middle of the National League for the next 17 years. In [[1953 in baseball|1953]] the [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewery bought the Cardinals, and [[Gussie Busch|August "Gussie" Busch]] became team president. He soon purchased Sportsman's Park from St. Louis Browns owner [[Bill Veeck]], renovated the ballpark, and renamed it [[Sportsman's Park|Busch Stadium]]. The Browns, who had not been as successful or popular as the Cardinals in three decades, realized they could not compete with the deep pockets of the brewery. After the 1953 season the Browns left St. Louis to become the [[Baltimore Orioles]], and the Cardinals were left as the only major league team in town.<ref name="Timeline4">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline4.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 4 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=15 May | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The Cardinals achieved another period of success in the 1960s with the help of a trade and a dominating pitcher. In [[1964 in baseball|1964]] the Cardinals traded pitcher [[Ernie Broglio]] and two other players to the rival Cubs for outfielder [[Lou Brock]] and two other players. The trade, since nicknamed "[[Brock for Broglio]]," has become definitive of a trade which in retrospect is ridiculously lopsided. The Cardinals would prove to be on the good side of the trade, as Brock would replace Musial, who had retired at the end of 1963, in left field in a Hall of Fame career that stretched through the 1970s. More immediately, though, in 1964 the Cardinals made a dramatic post-trade surge to take the NL pennant behind Brock and pitcher [[Bob Gibson]], who won 20 games for the first time. They then won the [[1964 World Series]] over the Yankees, with Gibson the Series MVP. 

In [[1966 in baseball|1966]] the Cardinals moved to the new [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], where they hosted the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] that summer. The next year the team reached and won the [[1967 World Series]] over the Red Sox. Gibson pitched 3 complete-game wins, allowing only 3 earned runs, and was named [[World Series MVP Award|World Series MVP]] for the second time. 

In [[1968 in baseball|1968]], nicknamed the "Year of the Pitcher" for the domination of pitching over hitting throughout the majors, the Cardinals' [[Bob Gibson]] proved to be the most dominant pitcher of all. Gibson's [[earned run average]] of 1.12 is a [[live-ball era]] record, and he won both the NL [[Cy Young Award]] and the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|NL MVP Award]]. Behind Gibson's season the Cardinals reached the [[1968 World Series]] against the Detroit Tigers. Gibson would pitch another 3 complete games and set a World Series record with 35 strikeouts, including a single-game record 17 in Game 1. Cardinals outfielder [[Curt Flood]] misplayed a fly ball by [[Jim Northrup]] into a triple in Game 7, however, allowing the Tigers to win the series. 

In 1969 the Cardinals took part in the first regular season Major League Baseball game played outside of the United States, when they played the [[Montreal Expos]] at [[Jarry Park]] in Montreal. Gibson won a second Cy Young Award in 1970, [[Joe Torre]] was the 1971 NL Most Valuable Player, and Brock set base-stealing records and reached 3,000 hits for his career, but the Cardinals failed to win a pennant during the 1970s.<ref name="Timeline4" />

===1980s&ndash;1990s===
The Cardinals returned to their winning ways in the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike-split and -shortened 1981]] season, with the best overall record in the [[National League East|NL East]], 59-43. The Cardinals were kept out of the postseason, however, because the strike resulted in the owners deciding on the following special playoff format:  (a) The division leader at the end of the first part of the split season (April through mid-June) would go to the [[1981 National League Division Series|1981 NL Division Series]]; (b) the division race would start over from square one in the separate, post-strike part (mid-August through September), and that division leader would play the early-season leader in the NLDS. The Cardinals finished second in each part of the season and watched the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (59-48 overall but 1-1/2 games ahead of the Cards prestrike) meet the [[Montreal Expos]] (60-48 overall but 1/2 GA post-strike) in the division series. (Similarly, in the [[National League West|NL West]] the 66-42 [[Cincinnati Reds]] finished 1/2 and 1-1/2 games behind the pre- and post-strike leaders, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Houston Astros]], respectively.)

But just like in 1964, a trade would propel the Cardinals upward. Before the [[1982 in baseball|1982]] season began the Cardinals acquired shortstop [[Ozzie Smith]] from the [[San Diego Padres]] via a trade. With Smith, and playing a form of baseball nicknamed [[Whiteyball]] after manager [[Whitey Herzog]], the Cardinals won the [[1982 World Series]] over [[Robin Yount]] and the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], which was nicknamed the ''"Sudway Series,"'' spoofing the two cities roots in the brewing indstury. Whitey's Cardinals would then return to the Fall Classic again a few seasons later, as they met [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]] in the [[1985 World Series]]. That series was dubbed the "I-70 Series" after the highway that connects the two in-state rivals. The Royals won in seven games, but the series is most remembered by Cardinals fans for a blown call by umpire [[Don Denkinger]] in Game 6 that turned the tide of the series for the Royals. It should be noted that the Royals won 11-0 in game 7. The Cardinals would also reach the [[1987 World Series]], losing to the [[Minnesota Twins]].<ref name="Timeline5">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline5.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 5 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=14 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref>
[[Image:mark mcgwire.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Mark McGwire]] broke the single-season home run record while playing with St. Louis in 1998.]]
The Cardinals hit another period of little success in the early 1990s. That changed in [[1996 in baseball|1996]] when the Cardinals hired [[Tony La Russa]] away from the [[Oakland Athletics]]. The team won the NL Central that season and defeated the Padres in the [[National League Division Series|NLDS]] before falling to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. In [[1998 in baseball|1998]] the Cardinals were the focus of the baseball world as slugging first baseman [[Mark McGwire]] broke the single season home run record by hitting 70 home runs. McGwire's epic pursuit of [[Roger Maris]]' record along with the Cubs' [[Sammy Sosa]] helped to re-popularize baseball after the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike]], bringing in new young fans and re-capturing a few fans lost by the player strikes.<ref name="Timeline5" />

===2000&ndash;present===
The start of the new millennium coincided with a new era of success for the Cardinals as the team, led primarily by [[Albert Pujols]], won the NL Central in six of seven years. The Cardinals would fall short in the post-season in [[2000 in baseball|2000]], [[2001 in baseball|2001]], and [[2002 in baseball|2002]] before missing the playoffs altogether in [[2003 in baseball|2003]]. However, in [[2004 in baseball|2004]] the Cardinals won 105 games for the best record in baseball. They then defeated the Dodgers in the [[2004 National League Division Series|NLDS]] and the [[Houston Astros]] in a seven game [[2004 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] to reach the [[2004 World Series]]. However, the Cardinals were swept by the Boston Red Sox, who won their first World Series in 86 years. The Cardinals won 100 games and another Central Division title in [[2005 in baseball|2005]], but lost in an [[2005 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] rematch to the Astros. The Cardinals moved to the new [[Busch Stadium]] in [[2006 in baseball|2006]] and finally overcame the playoffs. Despite winning only 83 games, the Cardinals caught fire in the playoffs and defeated the [[San Diego Padres]] in the [[2006 National League Division Series|NLDS]], and then the [[New York Mets]] in a seven game [[2006 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. In the [[2006 World Series]], the Cardinals faced the heavily-favored Detroit Tigers, but won in five games for the franchise's tenth World Series title.<ref name="Timeline6">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline6.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 6 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=14 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

====In-season tragedies====
On June 18, 2002 long-time Cardinals radio broadcaster [[Jack Buck]] died. Four days later, Cardinals starting pitcher [[Daryl Kyle]] died in his sleep, apparently of heart failure, before a game in Chicago against the Cubs. The game was canceled on the field by the Cubs captain at the time in a brief tearful statement to the fans. That days game was canceled but Kyle was scheduled to start the next day and in observance of their teammate, who never missed a start, the Cardinals played the game, as scheduled, against the Chicago Cubs. On April 29, 2007, also during a series with the Cubs, Cardinals relief pitcher [[Josh Hancock]], age 29, was killed in a car accident while driving drunk when his vehicle collided with a stopped tow truck that was aiding a disabled motorist on [[Interstate 64]], not far from [[Busch Stadium]].<ref name="Hancock">{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2860122 | title=ESPN article on Josh Hancock's death | work=ESPN.com Website | accessdate=14 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

==Ballpark==
{{Main|Busch Stadium}}
[[Image:BuschStadium 2006-05-30.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Busch Stadium]] has been the Cardinals home since 2006.]]
The Cardinals play their home games at Busch Stadium in downtown St. Louis. Busch Stadium, also called Busch III, opened for the [[2006 in baseball|2006]] season at a cost of $346 million<ref>[http://cardinals.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/stl/ballpark/stl_ballpark_newpark_factsheet.jsp Official Ballpark Factsheet] which states the costs of the stadium</ref> and can hold 46,861 people.<ref>[http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20060428&content_id=1422814&vkey=pr_stl&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl "Cardinals make 65,000 additional tickets available"] St. Louis Cardinals Press Release, April 28, 2006.</ref>  The Cardinals finished their inaugural season in the new Busch Stadium by winning the [[2006 World Series]], becoming the first team since the [[1923 in baseball|1923]] [[New York Yankees]] to win the World Series in their first season in a new ballpark. The ballpark has numerous statues of great former Cardinal players outside, including the iconic statue of [[Stan Musial]] in front of the third base entrance.

Busch Stadium is the Cardinals' fourth home ballpark and the third to be named Busch Stadium. The Cardinals' original home ballpark was [[Sportsman's Park]] from 1882&ndash;1893 when they were playing in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] and known as the Browns. During 1893 the Cardinals moved to a new ballpark originally called New Sportsman's Park but more commonly remembered as [[Robison Field]] which served as their home from 1893&ndash;1920.<ref name="Timeline1" />  During 1920 the Cardinals returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their crosstown rivals, the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]]. In 1953 the Cardinals were purchased by the [[Anheuser-Busch|Anheuser-Busch Brewery]] and the new owner subsequently purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] after the season. The Cardinals moved to [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis during the 1966 season and played there until 2005.<ref name="Timeline4" />  It was built as the [[multi-purpose stadium|multi-purpose]] home of both the baseball Cardinals and the St. Louis football Cardinals, now the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The current Busch Stadium was constructed immediately south of and partly on top of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium.

The Cardinals hold [[spring training]] at [[Roger Dean Stadium]] in [[Jupiter, FL]]. They share the complex, which opened in 1998, with the [[Florida Marlins]]. Before moving to Jupiter, the Cardinals hosted spring training at [[Al Lang Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, FL]] from 1937&ndash;1997.

==Logos and uniforms==
[[Image:St Louis Cardinals 1929-1948 logo.png|thumb|200px|right|The original "birds on the bat" logo.]]
The Cardinals have had few logos throughout their history, although those logos have evolved over time. The first logo associated with the Cardinals was an interlocking "SL" that appeared on the team's caps and or sleeves as early as 1900. Those early uniforms usually featured the name "St. Louis" on white home and gray road uniforms which both had [[cardinal red]] accents. In 1920 the "SL" largely disappeared from the team's uniforms, and for the next 20 years the team wore caps that were white with red striping and a red bill. In 1922, the Cardinals wore uniforms for the first time that featured two [[Northern Cardinal|cardinal]] birds perched on a [[baseball bat]] over the name "Cardinals" with the letter "C" of the word hooked over the bat. This logo, colloquially referred to as the "birds on the bat" originally had the birds on a black bat and Cardinal in printed letters. An alternate version of this logo with "St. Louis" replacing "Cardinals" appeared in 1930 and was the primary logo in 1931 and 1932 before "Cardinals" returned. In 1940 the now familiar "StL" logo was introduced on the team's caps. The interlocking "StL" has undergone several slight modifications over the years but has appeared on the team's caps every year since. The first appearance of the "StL" in 1940 coincided with the introduction of [[navy blue]] as a uniform color. From 1940 until 1955 the team wore navy blue caps with red bills and a red interlocking "StL" while the jerseys featured both cardinal red and navy blue accents. In 1951 the "birds on the bat" logo was changed to feature a yellow baseball bat. <ref name="Cardsunis">{{cite web | url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/uniforms.asp?lowYear=1882&highYear=2008&city=St.%20Louis&league=NL&sort=year&increment=18&pos=19 | title=Cardinals uniforms | work=Baseball Hall of Fame Uniform Database | accessdate=3 May | accessyear=2008}}</ref> [[Image:St Louis Cardinals 1998-present logo.gif|thumb|200px|right|The current "birds on the bat" logo introduced in 1998.]] In 1956 the Cardinals changed their caps to entirely navy with a red "StL", removing the red bill. Also, for that one season, the Cardinals wore a script "Cardinals" wordmark on the their uniforms without the "birds on the bat." However, an undated version of the "birds on the bat" logo would return in 1957 with the word "Cardinals" now written in cursive beneath the bat. In 1962, the Cardinals were the first National League team to display names on the back of their jerseys. In 1964 the Cardinals changed their caps to be all red with a white interlocking "StL". Following the trend in baseball at the time, the Cardinals replaced their more traditional front button shirts and pants with belts with new pullover t-shirts and elastic waist pants. Yet another trend in baseball led the Cardinals to change their road uniforms from gray to light blue from 1976&ndash;1985. In 1992 the Cardinals returned to wearing more traditional button-down shirts and pants with belts. That same year they also began wearing an all navy cap with a red "StL" on the road only while wearing the same red and white cap at home games. In 1998 the "birds on the bat" was updated for the first time in 40 years with more detailed birds and a bolder letters. In 2000 the Cardinals introduced a cap featuring a single cardinal bird perched on a bat, which they wear only during home games on Sundays. Over the years the Cardinals have also used other marketing logos that never appeared on uniforms that showed [[anthropomorphized]] cardinals in a pitching stance, swinging a baseball bat, or wearing a baseball cap.<ref name="Cardsunis" />

[[Jackie Robinson]]'s number 42 was retired throughout baseball in [[1997 in baseball|1997]]. The Cardinals 'retired' the number 42 a second time in Sept. [[2006 in baseball|2006]] as [[Bruce Sutter]] had been elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] earlier in the year.

Cardinal stockholders honored Busch with the number 85 on his 85th birthday, in 1984. Also, while not officially retired, the number 25 of [[Mark McGwire]] (1B, 1997&ndash;2001) has not been reissued since he retired, the number 51 of [[Willie McGee]] (OF 1982&ndash;1990, 1996&ndash;1999) has not been reissued since late in the 2001 season, and the number 57 of [[Darryl Kile]] (P, 2000&ndash;02) has not been reissued since his death in the middle of the [[2002 in baseball|2002]] season. (Kile is honored with a small circular logo bearing his initials and number on the wall of the Cardinal bullpen, as is deceased pitcher [[Josh Hancock]]. Hancock's number 32 also has not been reissued since his death in early 2007). The team also honored longtime radio commentator [[Jack Buck]] by placing a drawing of a microphone on the wall with the retired numbers.

The Cardinals are tied with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] as having retired the second-most numbers in baseball with 10, behind only the [[New York Yankees]]' 16.

==Radio and television==
{{see also|List of St. Louis Cardinals broadcasters}}
In St. Louis, Cardinals games on radio can be heard over [[KTRS (AM)|KTRS]], a [[talk radio]] station of which the team owns 50 percent. [[Mike Shannon]] and [[John Rooney]] alternate as [[play-by-play]] announcers. KTRS feeds the games to a network comprised of 115 stations, covering all or portions of [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Tennessee]].

Prior to moving to KTRS in 2006, the Cardinals and [[KMOX]] radio enjoyed a partnership that spanned over seven decades. But the relationship ended after the 2005 season when [[CBS Radio]], KMOX's parent company, and the Cardinals failed to reach terms on a new rights agreement, resulting in the team leaving the 50,000-watt [[clear-channel station]] in favor of becoming part-owners of 5,000-watt KTRS. 

On television, coverage is split between [[FSN Midwest]] and [[KSDK]], St. Louis' [[NBC]] affiliate. KSDK replaced [[KPLR-TV]] as the Cards' over-the-air television broadcaster starting in the 2007 season. KSDK and its predecessor, KSD-TV, previously carried the team from 1963 until 1987.

[[Dan McLaughlin]] and [[Al Hrabosky]] are the official announcers on FSN Midwest. [[Joe Buck]] had previously teamed with Hrabosky but now is the lead play-by-play caller for [[FOX]] [[Major League Baseball]] and [[National Football League]] broadcasts. Buck's father was Cardinals announcer [[Jack Buck]]. [[Jay Randolph]] and [[Rick Horton]] team up for KSDK contests. All telecasts on KSDK will be in [[High-definition television|HDTV]], along with a select number on FSN Midwest.
