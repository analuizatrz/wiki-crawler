The [[NZR]] '''English Electric DF class''' was the first class of mainline diesel-electric [[locomotives]] built for [[New Zealand]]'s [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national railway network]].  It should not be confused with [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] [[NZR DF class (1979)|DF class]] of [[1979]].  Manufactured in [[1954]] by [[English Electric]], they had a wheel arrangement of 2Co-Co2 under the [[UIC classification]] system, generated 1120 kW (1500 hp) of power, and could achieve a speed of 97 km/h.  They started the process of displacing [[Locomotive#Steam|steam motive power]] from main lines in New Zealand, but were soon displaced themselves by the [[NZR DA class|DA class]] of [[1955]].

Initially, 31 DF locomotives were ordered, but this order was amended to 10 DFs and 42 [[NZR DG class|DG]] locomotives.  The DG class in appearance was essentially half a DF.  The DF locomotives were lighter than the DAs and were used to haul freight trains on lines in [[Northland, New Zealand|Northland]] and the [[Bay of Plenty]] from which the DAs were prohibited.  Their only trips to the [[South Island]] were to visit [[Dunedin]] for maintenance.  Unfortunately, the DFs were plagued by unreliability and often had to undergo repairs.  This contributed to their short lifespan; withdrawal began in [[1972]] and the last was withdrawn in June [[1975]].  

==Preserved locomotives==
One DF, number 1501 (owned by FRONZ and now on long term lease to DTG) has been preserved as a static display at Sim Pacific Metals LTD, in poor condition. 1501 has now been moved to Westfield for assessment for suitability for towing to the Diesel Traction Group at Ferrymead.
