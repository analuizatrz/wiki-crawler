Madhavan's choice to be a part of this film, was unappreciated and one critic claimed, "With Madhavan being hot property in [[Kodambakkam]] ever since ''[[Alaipayuthey]]'', his second movie was highly anticipated.

===''Aayitha Ezhuthu'' and the future===
2004, despite starting poorly, was a very prolific year for Madhavan, who starred in the films ''[[Aethiree]]'', ''[[Nothing But Life]]'', and the critically acclaimed ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]''. After ''Aethiree'' failed, Madhavan banked upon ''Nothing But Life'', an English film, to divert him back into a career of stardom. But it also failed, leaving Madhavan offerless. However, [[Mani Ratnam]] selected Madhavan to play a lead role in his forthcoming bilingual. The film was made as ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]'' in Tamil and ''[[Yuva]]'' in Hindi, with only [[Esha Deol]] reprising her role in both versions. Apart from Deol, others in the multi-starrer were also actors who had been going through a rough patch. [[Surya Sivakumar]], [[Siddharth Narayan]], [[Meera Jasmine]] and [[Trisha Krishnan]] made up the rest of the cast. His character, Inba Sekhar, was a hitman living in the slums of [[Chennai]], who eventually went on to help a [[politician]] gain power. However Inba Sekhar's wife, Sasi, desperately tried to claw him away from his profession only to be beaten, thrown out and then come back crawling again.

====Game show hosting====
Madhavan was announced as the host of [[Sony Entertainment]] Television's [[Deal Ya No Deal]], the Indian version of the American game show [[Deal Or No Deal]], in October 2005.<ref name="host">{{cite web|author=Galatta.com|year=2005|title=Madhavan in Sony's 'Deal Ya No Deal' from November|publisher=Galatta.com|accessdate=2005-10-22|url=http://kannada.galatta.com/entertainment/livewire/kannada/livewire/id/493/news/madhavan.html}}</ref>

However Madhavan quit as the lead anchor of the game show, [[Deal Ya No Deal]] in January 2006.<ref name="quit">{{cite web|author=R. Madhavan|year=2006|title=Hosting Deal Ya No Deal
|publisher=rmadhavan.com|accessdate=2006-01-20|url=http://www.rmadhavan.com/back_alai/news.html}}</ref> Madhavan claimed he was "unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house". According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had "made it clear that he would continue with his South film assignments, and as the show was being filmed in Mumbai, he had found it hard to keep travelling throughout India from Chennai to film the ten days a month he had signed up for". The ever-changing look of the show meant Madhavan had to constantly rehearse. Madhavan also added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him with fatigue.<ref name="left">{{cite web|author=Sudhesh Kamath|year=2006|title=Madhavan returns as 'Thambi'
