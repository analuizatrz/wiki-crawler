[[Image:Van basten huntelaar.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Huntelaar (right) with Netherlands coach [[Marco van Basten]] during a training prior to Euro 2008.]]
Huntelaar was scouted as a youth talent by [[Go Ahead Eagles]], however, the distance required to travel prohibited him from joining the team from [[Deventer]].<ref name="officialbio"/> Soon after he was scouted by [[De Graafschap]] where on [[April 6]], [[1994]] he signed his first youth contract, aged eleven.<ref name="officialbio"/> During his first two years with De Graafschap, Huntelaar played as a left back, left winger, attacking midfielder, and even as a goalkeeper; only in his third year was he deployed as a striker.<ref name="officialbio"/> In the 1997–98 season, the now 14 year old Huntelaar was the first striker for the C-team at De Graafschap, and scored 33 goals in 20 matches.<ref name="officialbio"/> The following season saw him promoted to the B1 team, and in the 1999–00 season he became top scorer of the B1 league with 31 goals.<ref name="officialbio"/> His goal-scoring abilities drew the attention of [[PSV Eindhoven]], who signed him in June 2000.<ref name="officialbio"/>

Huntelaar is a [[striker]] who plays as a centre forward, or an "out-and-out" striker, rather than as a supporting striker. He has a good technical ability and can score goals with his head and with either foot.<ref name="goal.com"/> In an October 2007 interview Huntelaar stressed the importance of fitness to his game: ''"You have to work on every area but I would say that physical fitness is absolutely essential, especially in big games. I need to stay sharp and keep my speed up over 90 minutes, from the kick-off right through to the final whistle. That's fundamental."''<ref name="FIFA interview">{{cite web | title= Classy Huntelaar thinking big | publisher=FIFA.com | url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=609374.html |date=[[2007-10-01]]| accessdate=2007-10-19 }}</ref> He has been compared in playing style to [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Fernando Morientes]].<ref name="goal.com"/><ref name="UEFA profile">{{cite web | title= Huntelaar class shines through | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=512/newsId=383257.html |date=[[2006-01-13]]| accessdate=2007-10-15 }}</ref> [[Real Madrid C.F.]] manager [[Bernd Schuster]] has said of the player ''"It seems like they have cloned him from Marco van Basten.

Huntelaar has received praise from defenders that have had the task of marking him. Dutch international central defender [[Barry Opdam]] has said ''"He can easily move in between defense and our midfield, leaving most of us confused. He is smart. He can predict what his team mates do and what we will do in response. He also uses his body smartly. At the right time, before the cross or pass comes in, he’ll nudge you. That gives him those extra seconds or that extra half a yard. He has grown enormously, in particular physically."''<ref name="opponents">{{cite web | title=

He is a smart chap, using his body in a good way. He may not look it, but he is very strong. Never mean, though. Just smart. Little nudges, a quick pull on the jersey, those kind of things. He sometimes looks distracted, but that’s just his thing. He uses that to lull you to sleep."''<ref name="opponents"/> Swiss defender [[Stephan Keller]] states: ''"How to stop Huntelaar? Pfff…no idea. The thing is, everything he does, every move is thought about. He sees the game so well and he has the ability to sense when you’re just not paying attention and then he’s gone. He is the best I’ve ever seen. He will definitely make it big in Europe somewhere."''<ref name="opponents"/>
 
On [[July 2]], [[2007]], Huntelaar signed a sponsorship deal with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], having previously been under contract with [[Adidas]].<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Huntelaar verandert van merk | publisher=Voetbelkrant | url=http://www.voetbalkrant.com/index.php?menu=Nieuws&pag=Lezen&nieuws=151637 |date=[[2007-07-02]] | accessdate=2007-07-07 }}</ref> His agent is [[Arnold Oosterveer]], and not [[Vincenzo Morabito]] as has often been incorrectly been reported in the media.<ref>{{cite web | title=

==Career==
===PSV===
In his first season at PSV, Huntelaar quickly established himself as a prolific goalscorer for their A1 youth team under coach [[Willy van der Kuijlen]] (the all-time top scorer in the Eredivisie with 311 goals), scoring 26 goals in 23 games to become top scorer in the youth league.<ref name="officialbio"/> In his second season at PSV, Huntelaar was added to [[Guus Hiddink]]'s senior team, but failed to secure a place in the starting line-up. He made his first team debut as a [[Substitute (football)|substitute]] for [[Mateja Kežman]] on [[November 23]], [[2002]] in a 0–3 away win over [[RBC Roosendaal]]. This turned out to be his only [[Eredivisie]] appearance for the club.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title=

===De Graafschap===
Having failed to establish himself in the PSV first team, Huntelaar was sent on loan to his old club [[De Graafschap]].

===SC Heerenveen===
After Huntelaar turned down the opportunity to sign a new contract with PSV, [[Friesland|Frysian]] club [[SC Heerenveen]] moved in to sign him for a transfer fee of €100,000.<ref name="goal.com"/> The player has since explained his decision not to renew his contract with PSV, saying ''"I was there for two years and when I turned 18 I was loaned out to De Graafschap, where I'd played between the ages of 10 and 16, and then to AgoVV. When I went back to PSV the second time, I wasn't playing and the club didn't offer me anything specific. I just wanted to play and work on my game."''<ref name="FIFA interview"/> Heerenveen chairman [[Riemer van der Velde]] described what the club expected from the player: ''"He is a young, scoring striker who has undergone a good development last season. He will have to prove himself on a higher level, but I expect that he can benefit us greatly. If Huntelaar can score fifteen goals like [[Gerald Sibon|Sibon]] did last season, we can't complain".''<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Heerenveen en PSV eens over Huntelaar | publisher=Friesch Dagblad | url=http://www.frieschdagblad.nl/index.asp?artid=19009 |date=[[2004-06-29]]| accessdate=2007-10-17}} '''Dutch:''' "Het is een jonge, scorende spits die zich afgelopen seizoen goed heeft ontwikkeld.

It was only in February, in his fifth match for Ajax, that he scored his first goal, in a Gatorade Cup tie against his old club Heerenveen.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax naar halve finale Gatorade Cup door zege op Heerenveen | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/2299.htm | date=[[2006-02-02]]| accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> Once he had broken his scoring drought, Huntelaar started scoring regularly. During the month of February, Huntelaar scored nine goals in seven matches for Ajax, including a header against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] on his [[Champions League]] debut.<ref>{{cite web | title= Inter recovery pegs back Ajax | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/FixturesResults/Round=2202/match=1102853/Report=RP.html | date=[[2006-02-22]]| accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> Huntelaar continued his goal-scoring for the rest of the season, and ended as the Dutch league's top scorer, having scored sixteen goals in as many appearances for Ajax, bringing his total for the season to 33 goals in 31 matches.<ref name="topscorer">{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Huntelaar evenaart topscorer Cruijff | publisher=KNVB | url=http://www.knvb.nl/archief/clubs/knvb.nl_clubs__competities/huntelaar_evenaart_topscorer_cruijff | date=[[2006-04-17]]| accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref>  As Ajax finished second in the Dutch league, they needed to win the European play-offs to secure a place in the third round of the Champions League.

====2006/07====
When [[Jaap Stam]] was named Ajax captain in July 2006, Huntelaar was named as vice-captain.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Stam nieuwe aanvoerder Ajax, Perez vice-captain | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/3223.htm |date=[[2006-07-11]]| accessdate=2007-11-01 }}</ref> Huntelaar was the first player to score a goal at [[Arsenal F.C.]]'s new [[Emirates Stadium]] in a testimonial match for [[Dennis Bergkamp]] on [[July 22]], [[2006]] - a match Ajax ended up losing 2–1 (although in the second half, which started off with Ajax leading 1&ndash;0, 'legends' like [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Ian Wright]] played instead).<ref>{{cite web | title= Bergkamp given rousing farewell | publisher=BBC Sport | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/5203954.stm |date=[[2006-07-22]]| accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> Huntelaar started the 2006–07 European campaign well by scoring a brace away against Copenhagen in the first leg of the [[UEFA Champions League]] 3rd qualifying round in a 1-2 win.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax verslaat FC Kopenhagen dankzij Huntelaar | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/3354.htm |date=[[2006-08-09]]| accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> However, a shock 2–0 defeat home against Copenhagen meant that Ajax were demoted to the [[UEFA Cup]], in which Huntelaar scored eight goals in seven matches. In the [[Eredivisie 2006/2007|2006–07 Dutch league]], Huntelaar continued scoring, getting 21 goals in the league as Ajax once again finished second. In the KNVB Cup, Huntelaar scored four goals in six matches, including a goal in the cup final victory against AZ.<ref name="cup07">{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax wint beker na slijtageslag van 120 minuten | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/4996.htm |date=[[2007-05-06]]| accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> Finishing second in the league meant that Ajax once again had to play in the European play-offs to secure Champions League football for the next season.

[[Image:Huntelaar sit.jpg|thumb|175px|Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in training with Ajax.]]
The [[Eredivisie 2007/2008|2007–08 season]] started with mixed performances.

====2008/09====
At the start of the [[Eredivisie 2008-09|2008–09 season]], new Ajax manager [[Marco van Basten]] named Huntelaar as the first team captain, becoming the permanent successor to previous club captain [[Jaap Stam]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Huntelaar Is Ours – Van Basten | publisher=Goal.com | url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=777244 |date=[[2008-07-15]] | accessdate=2008-07-15 }}</ref>

===Netherlands national team===
====Youth squads====
Huntelaar participated in the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]] for the Netherlands under coach [[Louis van Gaal]]. The striker scored two goals in the tournament before the Dutch were eliminated in the quarter finals by Egypt.<ref name="officialbio"/>

[[Image:Huntelaar RVN.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Huntelaar (left) with [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]].]]
Huntelaar was part of the preliminary [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch squad]] prior to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], but was not chosen in the squad for the tournament itself. Coach [[Marco van Basten]] explained that he felt Huntelaar would benefit from more experience and from playing at the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006|UEFA Under 21&nbsp;football championships]] in [[Portugal]] with [[Foppe de Haan]]'s [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands U21 squad]], going as far as to say that it was up to the player to ''"show us there that by not selecting Huntelaar we did not do the right thing"''.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Huntelaar niet mee naar Duitsland | publisher=nu.nl | url=http://www.nu.nl/news/731913/41/Huntelaar_niet_mee_naar_Duitsland.html |date=[[2006-05-14]]| accessdate=2007-09-16 }}</ref>

While the senior Dutch squad went on to score just three goals in four games at the World Cup in Germany, the youth side did a lot better in the U21 championship. Huntelaar was the top-scorer of the Under 21 tournament with four goals as the young Dutch were victorious in the tournament. He scored a powerful strike in the semi-final against France and a brace in the final against Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web | title= uefa.com's Team of the Tournament | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/Under21/news/Kind=1/newsId=427313.html |date=[[2006-06-06]]| accessdate=2007-09-16 }}</ref> Huntelaar was named as one of the strikers in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship#Player awards|UEFA Team of the Tournament]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Huntelaar thrives in Dutch triumph | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/history/season=2006/intro.html |date=[[2006-06-01]]| accessdate=2007-11-15 }}</ref> After the tournament, Huntelaar retired from the under-21 squad, where he remains the all-time highest goal-scorer with 18 goals in 22 matches.

[[Image:Huntelaar v Persie.jpg|thumb|150px|Huntelaar (left) with [[Robin van Persie]].]]

====Senior squad====
Huntelaar's status as a rising star was confirmed when Marco van Basten decided to select the striker as his starting striker in the Dutch National squad's friendly against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on [[August 16]], [[2006]]. Huntelaar paid immediate dividends in his debut for the senior squad by scoring two goals, and making two assists, in Holland's 4&ndash;0 victory.<ref>{{cite web | title= Republic of Ireland 0-4 Holland | publisher=BBC Sport | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4795339.stm |date=[[2006-08-16]]| accessdate=2007-09-16 }}</ref> Huntelaar was the first player to score on his debut for the Dutch national squad since [[Dick Nanninga]] did so in 1978.<ref name="officialbio"/> However in his next seven caps he did not manage to add another goal, and due to the return of [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] to the team and the presence of other strikers like [[Robin van Persie]], [[Dirk Kuyt]], and [[Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink]], his chances in the team have been limited. 

After being left out of the squad for a number of games, he was recalled to the squad in October 2007 for the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] qualifying games against Romania and Slovenia.<ref>{{cite web | title= Huntelaar and Robben recalled | publisher=Sky Sports | url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11906_2782526,00.html |date=[[2007-10-05]]| accessdate=2007-10-06 }}</ref> Due to the suspension of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Huntelaar was in the starting line-up against Slovenia, scoring his first competitive international goal in a 2&ndash;0 win.<ref>{{cite web | title= Netherlands near finals goal with win | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/fixturesresults/round=2241/match=83696/report=rp.html |date=[[2007-10-17]]| accessdate=2007-10-18 }}</ref> He scored his fifth and sixth goal for the national team on [[March 26]], [[2008]] in a friendly match against Austria.<ref>{{cite web | title=  Huntelaar caps superb Dutch fightback | publisher=CNN | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/03/26/dutch.austria/ |date=[[2008-03-26]]| accessdate=2008-03-26 }}</ref> He scored his seventh goal in twelve national caps on [[May 24]], [[2008]] against Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web | title= Experimental Dutch ease past Ukraine | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=1/newsid=700632.html |date=[[2008-05-24]]| accessdate=2008-06-05 }}</ref> Huntelaar was included in Netherlands' [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] squad, scoring his first goal in a tournament with the opening goal of their final [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group C|Group C]] game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] putting them on the way to a 2&ndash;0 win.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/7363393.stm |title=France 0-2 Italy & Netherlands 2-0 Romania |date=[[2008-06-17]] |accessdate=2008-06-18 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury}}</ref>
