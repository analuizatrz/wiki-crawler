'''Mumia Abu-Jamal''' ([[IPA]]: {{IPA|/ˈmu.mi.ɑː ə.buʔ dʒə.ˈmɑːl/}}); (born '''Wesley Cook''' on [[April 24]], [[1954]]) is a former [[Black Panther Party]] activist, cab driver, author, and journalist from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], convicted for the murder of police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981. He is serving a presently undefined sentence of imprisonment at State Correctional Institution - Greene near [[Waynesburg, Pennsylvania]] in consequence. Originally sentenced to death, that sentence was quashed and resentencing ordered in December 2001 by a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Both he and the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] have appealed the ruling alternately as to the appropriateness of affirming the conviction and that of disaffirming the validity of the original sentence. 

His acknowledged [[cause célèbre]] has received international attention. Supporters and human rights campaigners variously assert that he is innocent, that the incident in question was a setup, that he did not receive a [[fair trial]], and/or express their opposition to the possibility of the administration of the [[death penalty]]. Skeptics and opponents assert that he is guilty, that he received the benefit of [[due process]] and was legitimately convicted of murder. Execution proponents among these assert that under Pennsylvania law, his eventual judicial execution is warranted and mandated by the nature of his crime.<ref name = "amn">{{cite web

The attention received has spawned controversies surrounding naming of public places; his status as an honoree of municipal, educational and civil society organizations; and his engagement as a radio commentator, writer and commencement speaker. During the period of his imprisonment he has continued his activism as a spoken word commentator and as a published author of several works - most notably ''[[Live from Death Row]]''.

[[Image:Daniel faulkner.jpg|right|thumb|Daniel Faulkner]] 
In the early hours of [[December 9]], [[1981]], around 3:51 a.m., [[Philadelphia Police Department]] officer [[Daniel Faulkner]] was shot and killed during an altercation that ensued from a routine traffic stop of a vehicle driven by [[William Cook (street vendor)|William Cook]], Abu-Jamal's younger brother. During the altercation Abu-Jamal was also shot and wounded. Officers arriving at the scene found a [[.38 Special|.38 caliber]] revolver beside Abu-Jamal that records show he had purchased in 1979. The cylinder of the revolver had five spent cartridges. He was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to a hospital and was treated for his injury. He was charged with the [[first-degree murder]] of Daniel Faulkner. He initially retained the services of criminal defense attorney Anthony Jackson.<ref name = "82t">{{cite web

[[Image:Philadelphia City Hall (from Art Museum).JPG|thumb|right|Philadelphia City Hall, shown in 2006]]
The case went to trial in June 1982 at [[Philadelphia City Hall|Philadelphia's City Hall]]. The judge initially acquiesced to Abu-Jamal's request to represent himself, with Jackson continuing to act as his legal advisor. During the first day of the trial, however, Abu-Jamal repeatedly and vociferously dissented from accepting the judge's rulings on points of law to the extent that he was removed from representing himself and it was ordered that Jackson resume the role of acting as his sole advocate by reason of what the judge deemed to be intentionally disruptive actions on Abu-Jamal's part.<ref>{{cite web

=== Prosecution case ===
The following sequence of events was presented in evidence by the prosecution before the jury at his trial:<ref name = "82t"/> 
# During the traffic stop, Cook assaulted Faulkner, who in turn attempted to subdue Cook.
# Abu Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot, crossed the street, and shot Faulkner in the back.
# Faulkner was able to return fire, seriously wounding Abu-Jamal.
# Abu Jamal then advanced on Faulkner, fired some additional shots at close range, one of which struck Faulkner in the face causing his death.
# Abu Jamal was unable to flee due to his own gunshot wound, collapsed on a nearby curb, and was taken into custody by other police officers, who had been summoned by Faulkner at the time of the traffic stop.

====Eyewitnesses====
Four eyewitnesses to the shooting were produced by the prosecution:

Robert Chobert was in his cab parked directly behind Faulkner's police car. He positively identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter, testifying: "I heard a shot.

Cynthia White testified to witnessing the shootings from a nearby corner. Describing Abu-Jamal's actions, she said: "he was running out of the parking lot and he was practically on the curb when he shot two times at the police officer. It was the back.

=== Defense case ===
The defense presented statements made by four witnesses describing the fact that one or more men were running along the street shortly after the shooting: Deborah Kordansky, Robert Chobert, Veronica Jones, and Dessie Hightower.<ref name = "82t"/> This became known as the "running man theory", based on the possibility that a "running man" may have been the actual shooter. Of those witnesses, only Chobert averred to actually witnessing the shooting. He testified that shortly after the shooting he had told police that he had seen Abu-Jamal shoot Faulkner in the face, and that Abu-Jamal had then run a short distance and collapsed on the sidewalk - himself having also been shot by Faulkner.<ref name = "chobert"/> The remaining three witnesses made various statements about a man or men running in or away from the area. None of them claimed that the running man, or men, were involved in the shooting.<ref name = "82t"/>

The defense also presented nine [[Character_witness#Criminal_trials|character witnesses]] including poet [[Sonia Sanchez]]. Sanchez testified that Abu-Jamal was "viewed by the black community as a creative, articulate, peaceful, genial man."<ref>{{cite web

Abu-Jamal's May 2001 sworn statement avers that he had been sitting in his cab across the street when he first heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, then heard the sound of gunshots. It further asserts that, upon seeing his brother standing in the street staggering and appearing disoriented he ran across the street to him and was shot by a uniformed police officer. It also incorporates Abu-Jamal's claim to have been tortured by the police while he was still in need of medical assistance for his wounds. It concludes with his claim of innocence: "I never said I shot the policeman. I did not shoot the policeman. I never said I hoped he died. I would never say something like that."<ref name = "mum"/>
