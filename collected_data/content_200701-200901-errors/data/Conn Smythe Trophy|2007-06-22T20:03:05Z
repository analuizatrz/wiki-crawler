The '''Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy''' is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the [[National Hockey League|National Hockey League's]] [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs. The winner is chosen by the vote of members of the ''Professional Hockey Writers' Association'' and is not necessarily a member of the Cup-winning team. The vote is conducted during the 2nd period of an elimination game in the Stanley Cup Finals. If the series is not decided by that game, then the votes will be discarded and the procedures will be repeated until a [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup winner]] is decided. The trophy is handed out prior to the presentation of the Stanley Cup by the commissioner, ''not'' during the NHL Awards the following week.

==History==
The trophy was named for [[Conn Smythe]] (1895-1980), a [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] builder and owner of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], and as such, the trophy depicts the old [[Maple Leaf Gardens]]. The first trophy was awarded to [[Jean Béliveau]] of the [[Montreal Canadiens]] for his performance in the [[1964-65 NHL season|1965]] Stanley Cup playoffs. Since then, [[Patrick Roy]] has won it three times, more than any other player in history and [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Mario Lemieux]], [[Bobby Orr]], and [[Bernie Parent]] have each won it twice. As for teams, it has been won 9 times by assorted Canadiens, and 4 times each by players from the [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[New York Islanders]].

The trophy has been awarded to members of a losing team five times, the most recent being [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère]] of the [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in 2003. The only non-goaltender to win the award in a losing cause is [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Reggie Leach]], who won it in [[1975-76 NHL season|1976]] when [[Montreal]] swept his Flyers.

With two exceptions, the winners of the Conn Smythe Trophy have all been Canadian. The two non-Canadian winners are [[Brian Leetch]] of the [[United States]] (when the [[New York Rangers]] won in [[1993-94 NHL season|1994]]) and [[Sweden]]'s [[Nicklas Lidström]] (when the [[Detroit Red Wings]] won in [[2001-02 NHL season|2002]]). Both Leetch and Lidstrom play defense.
