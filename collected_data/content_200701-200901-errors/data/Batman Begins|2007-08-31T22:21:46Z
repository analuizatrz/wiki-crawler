'''''Batman Begins''''' is a [[2005 in film|2005]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. [[Christopher Nolan]] directed the film, which stars [[Christian Bale]] as Batman, as well as [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Cillian Murphy]] and [[Morgan Freeman]].

After the commercial and critical failure of [[Joel Schumacher|Joel Schumacher's]] ''[[Batman & Robin (1997 film)|Batman & Robin]]'' in [[1997 in film|1997]], ''Begins'' was a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the Batman film franchise.  The lighter comic-toned direction Schumacher had taken the franchise was abandoned, and the new film was written about Batman's origins with some inspirations from classic comic book storylines such as ''[[Batman: The Man Who Falls]]'', ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', and ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]''. The film was the first live action film to depict this stage of the character's history.

''Batman Begins'' was successful, and a sequel titled ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' is commissioned for a [[2008 in film|2008]] release with both Nolan and Bale returning.

==Plot==
Aged eight, Bruce Wayne falls into a cave where he is attacked by a swarm of bats. Bruce develops a [[fear of bats]], and later urges his parents to leave an opera featuring bat-like creatures. Outside the theater, Bruce Wayne's parents are both killed in a robbery by mugger [[Joe Chill]]. After coming of age, Bruce returns to [[Gotham City]] from [[Princeton University]] intent on killing Chill, whose prison sentence is being [[suspended sentence|suspended]] in exchange for testifying against mob boss [[Carmine Falcone]]. One of Falcone's henchmen kills Chill. Bruce tells his childhood friend [[Rachel Dawes]] about his foiled plan, and she expresses disgust for his blind vengeance without regard for justice. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that he is ignorant of the nature of crime, so Bruce decides to travels the world for nearly seven years to understand the criminal mind. He is eventually detained in China for theft, where [[Henri Ducard|Ducard]] invites Bruce to join an elite vigilante group, the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]], led by [[Ra's al Ghul]]. Bruce is freed and travels to a mountaintop to begin his combat training with the League, who intend to use him to destroy Gotham. Bruce passes all the League's training, overcoming his childhood phobia in the process, but when ordered to execute a criminal, he turns on the League, destroying their headquarters and accidentally killing Ra's al Ghul. Bruce rescues an unconscious Ducard from the wreckage and leaves his mentor at a nearby village.

Bruce Wayne returns to a Gotham City that is mostly ruled by Falcone and begins plotting a one-man war against the corrupt system. He seeks the help of Rachel, now an assistant [[district attorney]], and police sergeant [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], who consoled him in the aftermath of his parents' murder. After reestablishing his connections to his father's company, [[Wayne Enterprises]], Bruce is able to acquire, with the help of former board member [[Lucius Fox]], a [[Batmobile#Batman Begins.2C 2005|prototype armored car]] and an experimental [[Batsuit#Batman Begins|armored suit]]. In his new Batman costume, he disrupts a drug shipment by Falcone and leaves the mob boss tied to a searchlight, forming a makeshift [[Bat-Signal]]. He also disrupts an assassination attempt on Dawes, leaving her with evidence against a judge who has previously gone soft on Falcone. While investigating the "unusual" drugs in the shipment, Batman is stunned by sinister psychopharmacologist [[Scarecrow (comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]], who sprays him with a powerful hallucinogen. Bruce's butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]] rescues Bruce, who receives an anti-toxin developed by Fox. Crane later poisons Rachel after showing her that the toxin, which is harmful only in vapor form, is being piped into Gotham's [[water supply network|water supply]]. Batman saves her. The police enter [[Arkham Asylum]] and arrest Crane while Batman escapes with Rachel.  After administering the antidote to Rachel in the [[batcave]], he gives her two vials of it for Gordon &ndash; one for the detective to inoculate himself, and another to mass produce for the city's population.

At a party held at [[Wayne Manor]], Bruce is confronted by a group of League of Shadows ninjas led by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul, the man killed earlier being a decoy. Ra's, who had been conspiring with Crane, plans to destroy Gotham by distributing the toxin undetected via Gotham's water supply and then vaporizing it with a microwave emitter stolen from Wayne Enterprises. Bruce, tricking his guests into leaving, fights briefly with Ra's while the League of Shadows set fire to Wayne Manor. Bruce escapes the inferno with Alfred's help just as the manor is destroyed. Batman arrives at the "Narrows" section of Gotham to aid the police in battling psychotic criminals, including Crane, who the League set free from the asylum.

Rachel is confronted by but wards off Crane; Batman rescues Rachel when more criminals go after her. Batman intimates his identity to her while leaving Gordon in control of the Batmobile to stop the [[elevated train]] that is being used to transport the vaporizer to the city's central water hub.  Batman battles Ra's aboard the train, then escapes just as Gordon topples the elevated line using the Batmobile's missiles, leaving Ra's to crash with the train to the ground. Following the battle, Batman becomes a public hero. Bruce gains control of Wayne Enterprises and installs Fox as CEO, firing Earle. However, he is unable to hold onto Rachel, who cannot reconcile her love for Bruce Wayne with his dual life as Batman. Gordon, newly promoted to lieutenant, unveils a [[Bat-Signal]] for Batman. Gordon mentions a criminal who, like Batman, has "a taste for the theatrical", leaving a Joker playing card at his crime scenes.  Batman promises to investigate it. As Batman is leaving, Gordon mentions that he hasn't thanked Batman for what he has done. Batman replies that Gordon will never have to. Batman then flies off into Gotham.

==Cast==
*'''[[Christian Bale]]''' as '''[[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]''': Nolan was considering [[Billy Crudup]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Hugh Dancy]], [[Joshua Jackson]], and [[Cillian Murphy]] for the role,<ref name="dynamic">{{ cite news | first=Cathy | last=Dunkley | coauthors=Bing, Jonathan | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117891989.html?categoryid=1019&cs=1 | title=Inside Move: New dynamic for WB duo | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2003-09-07]] | accessdate=2006-11-02 }}</ref> before Bale was cast on [[September 11]] [[2003]].

This effectively shattered the record of 70 pounds set by [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] in 1987 for his role in ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. At first he went well over the weight required (taking literally Nolan's instructions to "get as big as you can"), and when he was first introduced to the crew there was concern over whether he'd look right for the part. However, Bale worked hard to lose the excess weight, and was ready in time for filming.<ref>{{cite video| title = Shaping Mind and Body| medium = DVD| publisher = Warner Bros| date = 2005}}</ref> In terms of performance, Bale said he had to portray four characters: the raging Batman persona, the idiotic playboy facade Bruce uses to ward off suspicion, the vengeful young man out of college, and the angrier Bruce who is discovering his purpose in life.<ref>{{cite news | author = John Hutchins | title = Christian Bale | publisher = [[UGO]] | date = 2005 | url = http://batman.ugo.com/movies/batman_begins/bale.asp | accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>

*'''[[Michael Caine]]''' as '''[[Alfred Pennyworth]]''': The trusted butler to Bruce Wayne's parents, who continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths. He is Bruce Wayne's closest confidante. Though Alfred's family is depicted in the film as having served the Wayne family for generations, Caine created his own backstory, in that before becoming Wayne's butler, Alfred served in the [[Special Air Service]]. After being wounded, Thomas Wayne invited him because, "He wanted a butler, but someone a bit tougher than that, you know?"<ref>{{cite news | title = Alfred the Butler | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = July 2005 | pages = 79}}</ref>

*'''[[Morgan Freeman]]''' as '''[[Lucius Fox]]''': A high-ranking [[Wayne Enterprises]] employee who was demoted to working in the company's Applied Science Division, where he conducts advanced studies in [[biochemistry]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

===Writing===
Director Christopher Nolan stated his intention to reinvent the film franchise of Batman by "doing the origins story of the character, which is a story that's never been told before". Nolan said that humanity and realism would be the bases of the origin film. "The world of Batman is that of grounded reality. [It] will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises," said the director. Screenwriter David S. Goyer said that the goal of the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne.<ref name="beautiful">{{cite news | first=Marc | last=Graser | coauthors=Dunkley, Cathy | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117899714.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=The bat and the beautiful | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2004-02-08]] | accessdate=2006-11-02 }}</ref> Christian Bale added that the previous films underused Batman's character, overplaying the villains instead.<ref>{{cite news| title = Christian Bale on ''Batman Begins''| publisher = SuperHeroHype| date = 2004-11-19| url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/batmannews.php?id=2232| accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref>

The film's overall look, feel and story was inspired by several works. DC Comics president [[Paul Levitz]], director Christopher Nolan and screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]] worked as a team to draw ideas from thirty years' worth of Batman comics. Nolan's personal "jumping off point" was ''[[Batman: The Man Who Falls]]'', a short story about the death of Bruce Wayne's parents and Bruce's travels throughout the world. The early scene in ''Batman Begins'' of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was directly adapted from ''The Man Who Falls''.<ref name="genesis">{{cite video | people=[[Dan DiDio|DiDio, Dan]] (Vice President of DC Comics), [[David S.

===Filming===
In January 2004, the untitled ''Batman'' project was scheduled to film in [[London]], [[New York City]], and [[Iceland]].<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/batmannews.php?id=769 | title=''Batman'' Filming in New York as Well | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=[[2004-01-30]] | accessdate=2006-11-02 }}</ref>  In February 2004, crews transformed the restaurant Plateau in [[Canary Wharf]] for a hotel restaurant scene.<ref>{{cite news | first=Allison | last=Martin | url=http://icthewharf.icnetwork.co.uk/thisweek/news/content_objectid=13964984_method=full_siteid=71670_headline=-PLAT-MAN-name_page.html | title=Plat-Man | publisher=icTheWharf.co.uk | date=[[2004-02-19]] | accessdate=2006-11-02 }}</ref>  In the same month, an airship hangar at [[Cardington, Bedfordshire]] was rented by Warner Bros. for constructing a set in time for filming in April 2004.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/beds/bucks/herts/3506175.stm | title=Airship hangar is home to Batman | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=[[2004-02-20]] | accessdate=2006-11-02 }}</ref> Filming began on March in Iceland, and Nolan refused a second unit, to keep his vision consistent.<ref name="about production">{{cite web| title = Batman Begins Production Notes - About the Production| publisher = Warner Bros| url = http://www2.warnerbros.com/batmanbegins/productionnotes/#| accessdate = 2007-02-24}}</ref> The crew was hampered by 75 mph winds, but nonetheless they moved ahead to London by [[March 20]] [[2004]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Mike Szymanski | title = 'Batman Begins' Filming Marred By Storm | publisher = Zap2it.com | date=[[2004-03-20]] | url = http://movies.zap2it.com/movies/news/story/0,1259,---20927,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref>

===Design===
Director Christopher Nolan used the [[science fiction film]] ''[[Blade Runner]]'' as a source of inspiration for ''Batman Begins''. The director screened ''Blade Runner'' to cinematographer [[Wally Pfister]] and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film's world as "an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn't appear to have any boundaries", a lesson that he applied to the production of ''Batman Begins''.<ref>{{cite news | first=Pat | last=Jankiewicz | url= | title=Dark Knight Resurrected | publisher=[[Starlog]] | date=August 2005 | accessdate=2006-11-06 }}</ref>

Director Christopher Nolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of [[Gotham City]]. Nolan designed Gotham City to be a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], and [[Tokyo]], the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. In ''Batman Begins'', the Narrows was based on the [[slum]]mish nature of the (now demolished) [[Kowloon Walled City|walled city of Kowloon]] in [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Otto | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/622/622719p1.html | title=Interview: Christopher Nolan | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2006-06-05]] | accessdate=2006-11-06 }}</ref>

====Batmobile====
[[Image:Batmantumbler2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Tumbler, the [[Batmobile]] used in ''Batman Begins''.]]
Nathan Crowley, one of the production designers for ''Batman Begins'', started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by [[kitbashing|model bashing]]. One of the parts that Crowley used to create the vehicle was the nose cone of a [[P-38 Lightning]] model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler's jet engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of [[Styrofoam]], which was a process that lasted two months.<ref name="batmobile">{{cite web | first=Marshall | last=Brain | url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/batmobile.htm/printable | title=How the Batmobile Works | publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] | accessdate=2006-11-05 }}</ref>

The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel "test frame", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over 100 [[miles per hour|mph]], go from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds, possess a [[steering]] system to make sharp turns at city corners, and to withstand a self-propelled launch of up to 30 feet. On the very first jump test, the Tumbler's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5.7-liter Chevy [[V8 engine]], a truck axle for the rear axle, front racing tires by Hoosier, rear 4x4 mud tires by Interco., and the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.<ref name="batmobile" />

With the design process completed, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 [[carbon fiber]] panels and costing $250,000 each to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six [[propane]] tanks.  Due to the poor visibility inside the vehicle by the driver, monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film's scenes.<ref name="batmobile" />

The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was over-sized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a [[radio-controlled car|miniature model]] that was 1:5 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual race car was used for the waterfall sequence.<ref name="batmobile" />

====Batsuit====
[[Image:Batsuitplusbats.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Batman uses the Batsuit to summon bats for distraction in the Arkham Asylum.]]
The filmmakers intended to create a very mobile Batsuit that would allow the wearer to move easily in order to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restricted full head movement. Lindy Hemming, the costume designer for ''Batman Begins'', and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed "Cape Town", a secured compound located at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London. The Batsuit's basic design was a [[neoprene]] undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Batman actor [[Christian Bale]] was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.<ref name="batsuit">{{cite web | url=http://www2.warnerbros.com/batmanbegins/productionnotes/# | title=''Batman Begins'' Production Notes - The Batsuit & Gadgetry | publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate=2006-11-06 }}</ref>

For the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a "flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of [[parachute]] [[nylon]] that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]]. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show "a man who has angst", so his character would be revealed through the mask.<ref name="batsuit" />

For the film, three people were needed to dress Christian Bale up in the Batsuit. Since Bale wore the Batsuit for hours at a time, overheating became an issue. Plastic tubes were occasionally routed into the Batsuit as Bale wore it to provide a "cool suit" similar to those worn by high-altitude pilots and astronauts.  To best pose as Batman, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero. Nolan said that Bale succeeded in his intimidating pose, recalling, "Everyone on set felt quite a charge when Christian would walk on in the Batsuit."  Bale had a love-hate relationship with the suit, which had often sent him into foul moods, helping him transform into Batman. Bale said, "Batman's meant to be fierce, and you become a beast in that suit, as Batman should be – not a man in a suit, but a different creature."<ref name="batsuit" />

===Film score===
{{seealso|Batman Begins (soundtrack)}}
The film score for ''Batman Begins'' was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[James Newton Howard]]. Director Christopher Nolan originally invited Zimmer to compose the film score, and Zimmer asked the director if he could invite Howard to compose as well, as they had always planned a collaboration.<ref name=knightmusic>{{cite news | author = Danny Graydon | title = A Little Knight Music | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = July 2005 | pages =87}}</ref> The two composers collaborated on separate themes for the "split personality" of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. Zimmer and Howard began composing in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and moved to [[London]] where they stayed for 12 weeks to complete most of their writing.<ref>{{cite news | author=Spence D | url=http://music.ign.com/articles/624/624382p1.html | title=Batman Vs.

Zimmer wanted to avoid composing a film score that had been done before, so the score became an amalgamation of [[orchestra]] and [[electronic music]]. The film's ninety-piece orchestra<ref name=knightmusic/> was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal amount of [[cello]]s. Zimmer enlisted a [[choir]] boy to help reflect the music in the film's scene where Bruce Wayne's parents are killed. "He's singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it's like froze, arrested development," Zimmer said. Zimmer also attempted to add human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as "psychotic", through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film.<ref name="zimmer"/> Zimmer composed the action sequences, while Howard focused on the film's drama.<ref name=knightmusic/>
