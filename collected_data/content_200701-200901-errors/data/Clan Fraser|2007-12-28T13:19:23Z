{{Clan Fraser}}

'''Clan Fraser''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] - ''Clann Frisealach,'' [[French Language|French]] ''"Clan Frasier"'') is a [[Scottish clan]] of [[French people|French]] origin. The Clan has been strongly associated with [[Inverness]] and the surrounding area since the Clan's founder gained lands there in the [[13th century]]. Since its founding, the Clan has dominated local politics and been active in every major military conflict involving Scotland.  It has also played a considerable role in most major political turmoils.

The Clan's current chief is [[Simon Fraser, 16th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser]], the 16th [[Lord Lovat]], and 25th [[Chiefs of Clan Fraser|Chief of the Clan]]. The arms of Clan Fraser are ''Quarterly: 1st and 4th Azure, three fraises Argent, 2nd and 3rd Gules, three antique crowns Or,'' or in [[layman's terms]], the traditional three [[cinquefoil]]s, or Fraises ([[strawberry]] flowers), as they have come to be known, in the first and fourth positions and three crowns in the second and third positions. Only the Lord Lovat is allowed use of these arms plain and undifferenced.<ref name=tartans>* Neil Grant. ''Scottish Clans and Tartans.'' Crescent Books, New York, 1987. ISBN 0-517-49901-0.</ref>

== History ==
=== Origins of the surname ===
{{main|Fraser (surname)}}
The surname 'Fraser' is of an uncertain origin.<ref name="ancestry">http://www.ancestry.com/learn/facts/Fact.aspx?fid=10&ln= Retrieved on [[July 10]], [[2007]]</ref> The first record of the name occur in the mid-[[twelfth century]] as "de Fresel", "de Friselle", and "de Freseliere",<ref name="ancestry"/> and appears to be a [[Normans|Norman]] name, though there is no known placename in [[France]] that corresponds with it.<ref name="ancestry"/> Also, it has been thought possible that a [[medieval]] scribe could have corrupted a [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name beyond recognition.<ref name="ancestry"/>

A tradition, favoured by the leading family of Fraser, derived the clan's descent from a [[Frenchman]], Pierre Fraser, Seigneur de Troile, who came to Scotland in the reign of [[Charlemagne]] to form an alliance with the mythical [[Achaius, King of Scots|King Achaius]].<ref name="ScottishNation">Anderson, William. ''The Scottish Nation.'' (Vol.2), p.258.</ref> Pierre's son was then to have become [[thane]] of the [[Isle of Man]] in [[814]].<ref name="ScottishNation"/> 

Another explanation for the surname is that it is derived from the [[French language|French]] words ''fraise'', meaning [[strawberry]] (the fruit), and ''fraisiers'', strawberry plants.<ref name="tartans"/> There is a fabled account of the Fraser [[coat of arms]] which asserts during the reign of [[Charles the Simple]] of France, a nobleman from [[Bourbon]] named [[Julius de Berry]] entertained the King with a dish of fine strawberries.<ref name="ScottishNation"/> De Berry was then later knighted, with the knight taking strawberry flowers as his Arms and changing his name from 'de Berry' to 'Fraiseux' or 'Frezeliere'.<ref name="ScottishNation"/> His direct descendants were to become the lords of [[Neidpath Castle]], then known as Oliver.<ref name="annals">Fraser, Archibald Campbell. ''Annals... of the Frasers of Loveth.'' Clan Fraser Association for California, 2003. Ed. Diolain Fraser.</ref> This origin has been disputed, and seen as a classic example of [[Canting arms|canting heraldry]], where heraldic symbols are derived from a pun on similar sounding surname: (strawberry flowers - ''fraises'').<ref>Black, George Fraser. ''The Surnames of Scotland.''</ref><ref name="HighlandClans8083">[[Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk|Moncreiffe of that Ilk, Sir Ian]]. ''The Highland Clans'', p.80-83.</ref>

===Early Frasers===

Around the reign of [[William the Lion]] (r.[[1165]]-[[1214]]), there was a mass of "Norman" immigration into Scotland. [[Thomas Grey]], a [[fourteenth century]] English Knight, listed several "Norman" families which took up land during William's reign.<ref name="TheKingdomScotts331"/> Among those listed, the families of Moubray, Ramsay, Laundells, Valognes, Boys and Fraser are certainly or probably introduced under king William.<ref name="TheKingdomScotts331">[[G. W. S. Barrow|Barrow, G W S]]. ''The Kingdom of the Scots'', p.331.</ref>

The earliest written record of Frasers in Scotland is in [[1160]], when a Simon Fraser held lands in [[East Lothian]] at [[Keith Marischal|Keith]]. In that year, he made the gift of a church to the [[Tironensian]] monks at [[Kelso Abbey]].<ref name=tartans/> The Frasers moved into [[Tweeddale]] in the [[12th century|twelfth]] and [[13th century|thirteenth]] centuries and from there into the counties of [[Stirlingshire|Stirling]], [[Angus]], [[Inverness-shire|Inverness]] and [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeen]].<ref name=annals>Fraser, Archibald Campbell.

[[Image:Scotlan Beauly Priory.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The remains of [[Beauly]] Priory.]]
Sir [[Simon Fraser (d. 1306)|Simon Fraser]] of Oliver acquired the Bisset Lands around [[Beauly]] when he won the hand of its heiress, a young Bissett. [[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]] granted the right of the ''"Lordship of Loveth, vulgo Morich,"'' in the [[Aird, Inverness|Aird]], in [[1253]]<ref name=annals/><ref>A copy of this charter may be found at [[:wikisource:Charter of the right of the Lordship of Lovat|Charter of the right of the Lordship of Lovat]] from Wikisource.</ref>, and the corresponding lands, to '''Simon Fraser of Lovat''', either his son or cousin, from whom the Clan Fraser claims descent.<ref name=annals/> Sir Simon held other lands in Aberdeen, which were given to his eldest son (or cousin), Sir [[Alexander Fraser of Cowie]]. It is from Alexander that the [[Frasers of Philorth]] descend. In [[1336]], Thomas Fraser, of the [[Frasers of Muchalls]], gained the estates of Stonywood and Muchalls in [[Kincardineshire]], and soon erected a [[tower house]] stronghold overlooking the [[North Sea]]. This tower house was later expanded, and became known as [[Muchalls Castle]].<ref>[http://www.baronage.co.uk/bphtm-03/fraser04.html Frasers of Muchalls]. Baronage Press. Retrieved [[14 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

=== Wars of Scottish Independence ===
During the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], Sir [[Simon Fraser (d. 1306)|Simon Fraser]], known as "the Patriot," fought first with the [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|Red Comyn]], and later with Sir [[William Wallace]] and [[Robert the Bruce]].<ref name="annals"/>

Sir Simon is celebrated for having defeated the [[England|English]] in three separate engagements at the [[Battle of Roslin]] in [[1303]], with just 8,000 men under his command. Along with the Clan Fraser, the [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|Red Comyn]]'s [[Clan Comyn]], and the [[Clan Sinclair]] are known to have fought at the battle, which took place on [[24 February]] 1303.<ref name="annals"/> At the [[Battle of Methven]] in [[1306]], Sir Simon led troops along with Bruce, and saved the King's life in three separate instances. Simon was allegedly awarded the 3 Crowns which now appear in the [[Frasers of Lovat|Lovat Arms]] for these three acts of bravery. At the end of the day, he was captured by the [[England|English]] and executed with great cruelty by [[Edward I of England|King Edward]] in [[1306]], in the same barbaric fashion as Wallace.<ref name="annals"/> At the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in [[1314]], Sir Simon's cousin, Sir [[Alexander Fraser of Cowie]], was much more fortunate. He fought at Bannockburn, married Bruce's sister, and became [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of Scotland. The Frasers of Philorth trace their lineage from Alexander.<ref name="annals"/> At the [[Battle of Halidon Hill]] in [[1333]], Alexander Fraser's three younger brothers, Simon Fraser of Lovat, Andrew, and James, were killed while fighting the English.<ref name="annals"/>

As most all Highlanders, the Frasers have been involved in countless instances of Clan warfare, particularly against the Macdonalds.<ref name="tartans"/> Two [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] war cries of the Frasers have been generally recognized. The first, '''''"Caisteal Dhuni"''''' (Castle Dounie/Downie) refers to the ancestral Castle and Clan seat, which once existed near the present [[Beaufort Castle]]. The second is '''''"A Mhòr-fhaiche"''''' (The Great Field).<ref name="tartans"/>

In 1544, the Frasers fought a great clan battle,  the [[Battle of the Shirts]] (''Blar-ne-Léine,'' in Gaelic) against the [[Clan MacDonald of Clan Ranald]], over the disputed chiefship of Clan Ranald. The Frasers, as part of a large coalition, backed a son of the 5th Chief, Ranald ''Gallda'' (the Stranger), which the MacDonalds found unacceptable. The [[Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]] intervened, refusing to let the two forces engage. But on their march home, the 300 Frasers were ambushed by 500 MacDonalds. Only five Frasers and eight MacDonalds are said to have survived the battle. Both the Lovat Chief, [[Hugh Fraser, 3rd Lord Lovat|Hugh Fraser]], and his son were amongst the dead and were buried at [[Beauly Priory]].<ref name=tartans/>

Robert Mor Munro, 15th chief of [[Clan Munro]], was a staunch supporter of [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]], and he consequently was treated favourably by her son, [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]]. Robert was also a faithful friend of Mary. Scottish historian [[George Buchanan]], a contemporary, wrote that when the unfortunate princess went to [[Inverness]] in [[1562]]: "as soon as they heard of their sovereign's danger, a great number of the most eminent Scots poured in around her, especially the '''Frasers''' and Munros, who were esteemed the most'' 'valiant of the clans inhabiting those countries in the north.' ''" These two clans took [[Inverness Castle]] for the Queen. The Queen later hanged the governor, a [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]] who had refused her admission.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/m/munro2.html Munro]. Electric Scotland. Retrieved on 11 February 2007.</ref>

In 1571 the Clan Fraser joined forces with the [[Clan Forbes]] in their centuries-long feud against the [[Clan Gordon]]. The Frasers and Forbes were joined by [[Clan Keith]] and [[Clan Crichton]]. The Gordons were joined by [[Clan Leslie]], [[Clan Irvine]] and [[Clan Seton]]. The feud culminated in two full scale battles: the Battle of Tillieangus and the Battle of Craibstone. At the first, the 6th Lord Forbes's youngest son, known as Black Aurther Forbes, was killed. Legend has it that "''he stooped down to quench his thirst and one of the Gordons gave him his death blow through an open joint in his armour''".<ref name="tartans"/> A separate battle took place between the Clan Fraser (with help from the [[Clan MacRae]]) and the [[Clan Logan]] at [[North Kessock|Kessock]], where Gilligorm, the Chief of the [[Clan Logan]], was killed.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/htol/logan2.html Clan Logan].

=== Call to arms & civil war ===
[[Image:Illustration Taxus baccata0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Traditionally, Frasers wear small branches of ''Iubhar'' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]), or [[Taxus baccata|Yew]], in their caps.]]
During the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of [[1644]]–[[1650]], the Clan was as active as ever, supporting the cause of the [[Covenanter]]s.

In [[1645]], at the [[Battle of Auldearn]], in [[Nairnshire]], the Clan opposed the Royalist leader [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]], and fought under a Fraser of Struy (from a small village at the mouth of [[Glen Strathfarrar]]). The battle left eighty-seven Fraser widows.<ref>[http://www.fraser-clan.org/update/fraser_connections_5.htm Clan Fraser Society of Scotland and the UK] Retrieved on 07 March 2007</ref> A poem about the battle reads:<ref name=tartans/>
<poem>
''"Here Fraser Fraser kills, a Browndoth kills a Browndoth.''
''A Bold a Bold, and Lieth's by Lieth overthrown.''
''A [[Clan Forbes|Forbes]] against a Forbes and her doeth stand,''
''And [[Clan Drummond|Drummonds]] fight with Drummonds hand to hand.''
''There dith Magill cause a Magill to die,''
''And [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]] doth the strenth of Gordon try.''
''Oh! Scotland, were though Mad? Off thine own native gore.''
''So Much till now thou never shedst before."''
</poem>

In [[1649]], the Clan Fraser and [[Clan Munro]] joined for a second time to assault Inverness Castle. This time, they were also joined by the [[Clan Urquhart]] and the [[Clan MacKenzie]], with whom they had recently made peace. The four clans, all opposed to the authority of the current [[parliament]], assaulted the town and took the castle. They then expelled the garrison and raised the [[fortifications]]. However, on the approach of the parliamentary forces led by [[David Leslie (Scottish general)|General Leslie]], the clans retreated back into [[Ross-shire]]. Over the next year, several skirmishes took place between these parties. <ref>[http://website.lineone.net/~indexer/suter04.html Suter, James. "Memorabilia of Inverness".

=== Jacobite risings ===
[[Image:Simon Fox.gif|thumb|left|[[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon "the Fox" Fraser]], 
11th Lord Lovat, [[1668]]. The Fox was Chief during the second and third [[Jacobite Risings]].]]
In [[1689]], the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed the [[Roman Catholic]] King [[James II of England|James VII]] as monarch of England, replacing the King with his [[Protestant]] daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband and cousin [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. Swiftly following in March, a Convention of the Estates was convened in Edinburgh, which supported William & Mary as joint monarchs of Scotland. However, to much of Scotland, particularly in the Highlands, James was still considered the rightful, legitimate King.

==== Bonnie Dundee ====
On [[16 April]] [[1689]] [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|John Graham of Claverhouse]], [[Viscount Dundee]], raised the royal standard of the recently deposed King [[James II of England|James VII]] on the hilltop of [[Dundee Law]]. Many of the Highland clans rallied swiftly to his side.  The chief of the Clan Fraser, [[Thomas Fraser, 10th Lord Lovat|Thomas Fraser]], tried to keep the members of his clan from joining the uprising, to no avail: The Clan marched without him, and fought at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]]. In [[1690]], Thomas gave in and joined them.<ref name=harper>J.R. Harper. ''The Fraser Highlanders.'' The Society of The Montreal Military & Maritime Museum, Montreal, 1979.</ref>

==== The Fifteen ====
The Clan Fraser was split during the first [[Jacobite rising]] in 1715. While some supported the Jacobite cause, Simon "the Fox" Fraser, Chief at the time, supported the British Government. In [[1715]], a force led by Simon, who had been outlawed by the Stewarts and was in exile, surrounded the Jacobite garrison in Inverness. The [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch]] attempted to relieve the garrison, but when their path was blocked by the Frasers, Keppoch retreated.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/mackenzie/images/CHAPT.10.pdf Chapter 10] of the History of the Clan MackKenzie. Electric Scotland. Retrieved on 11 February 2007</ref> The Inverness garrison surrendered to Fraser on the same day that the [[Battle of Sheriffmuir]] was fought, and another Jacobite force was defeated at the [[Battle of Preston]]. Soon after this 31 year old Chief Colonel Robert Munro of Foulis marched into the town of Inverness with 400 Munros and took over control as governor from Fraser. In [[1719]] the Clan Fraser fought for the British government at the [[Battle of Glenshiel]] where they helped defeat the Jacobites and [[Clan MacKenzie|MacKenzies]] alike.<ref name=harper/>

==== The Forty-Five ====
On [[2 August]] [[1745]], a frigate successfully landed [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]], grandson of [[James VII]] with his ''seven men of [[Moidart]]'' on the island of [[Eriskay]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]]. He would go on to raise the royal standard at [[Glenfinnan]], and led the second Jacobite rising in Scotland. The by-now-infamous Simon "the Fox" Fraser supported the Jacobites and [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] during [[Jacobite rising#the .27forty-five|The '45]]. One very strong reason was that Simon had been created [[Duke of Fraser]], [[Marquess of Beaufort]], [[Earl of Stratherrick and Abertarf]], [[Viscount of the Aird and Strathglass]] and Lord Lovat and [[Beauly]] in the [[Jacobite Peerage of Scotland]] by James Francis Edward Stuart in [[1740]]. Frasers were on the front lines of the Jacobite army at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)]], and the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746.<ref name=harper/>

===== Culloden =====
The [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746 was a decisive defeat for the Jacobites and the House of Stuart.  At the battle, Frasers made up the largest Centre Regiment of the Front line, with 400 men under [[Charles Fraser of Inverallochy|Charles Fraser]] of [[Inverallochy]], and [[General Simon Fraser of Lovat|Simon Fraser]], Master of Lovat. The Fox was not present at the battle, reportedly trying to gather dispersed Clansmen to fight. 

Being on the front line, the Frasers were one of the few units to actually close with Government forces, breaking through Barrell’s regiment with 800-900 other Highlanders ([[Atholl]] men, [[Clan Cameron|Camerons]], [[Clan Stewart of Appin|Stewarts of Appin]]). The ferocious Frasers were massacred by the Government second line.

==== Aftermath ====
[[Image:Fraser Grave at Culloden Moor.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Fraser gravestone at Culloden Moor. Frasers who fell at the [[Battle of Culloden]] were buried in a mass grave underneath this stone. Hundreds may lie underneath it. Each clan had its own grave.]]  After the battle, the same year, Castle Dounie was burnt to the ground, while the Fox was on the run. He was captured, tried for treason, and executed in [[London]] on 9 April [[1747]], and his estates and titles were forfeited to the Crown. <ref name=harper/>

The Fox's son, Simon Fraser escaped punishment, and was pardoned - later raising a Fraser regiment for the British army which fought in Canada in the [[1750s]], including [[Quebec]].<ref name=harper/> Charles Fraser was mortally wounded and found by [[Henry Hawley|General Hawley]] on the field, who ordered one of his aides, a young [[James Wolfe]] to finish him off with a pistol. Wolfe refused, so Hawley got a common soldier to do it.<ref name=harper/> We also know the fate of some of the clansmen. David Fraser of Glen Urquhart, who was a deaf-mute had, it was said, charged and killed seven redcoats, but was captured and died in prison. John Fraser, also called ‘MacIver’ was shot in the knee, taken prisoner and put before a firing squad, but was then rescued by a British officer, [[Lord Boyd]], who was sick of the slaughter. Another John Fraser, who was [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] of [[Inverness]] tried to get fair treatment for the prisoners.<ref name=harper/>

Castle Dounie was replaced by a small square building costing £300 in which the Royal Commissioner resided until [[1774]], when some of the forfeited Lovat estates were granted by an [[Act of Parliament]] to his son, Simon Fraser ([[1726]]-[[1782]]), by then a major general, in recognition of his military service to the Crown and the payment of some £20,000.<ref name=harper/> Later, two modest wings were added. On the death of General Fraser’s younger half-brother, [[Colonel]] [[Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat]] (1736-1815), without legitimate surviving male issue, the Lovat estates were transferred, by entail, to [[Thomas Alexander Fraser]] of [[Strichen]]([[1802]]-[[1875]]), a distant cousin who was descended from Thomas Fraser of Knockie & Strichen ([[1548]]-[[1612]]), second son of [[Alexander Fraser, 4th Lord Lovat]] ([[1527]]-[[1557]]). Knockie was sold about [[1727]] to [[Hugh Fraser of Balnain]] ([[1702]]-[[1735]]).<ref name=harper/>

=== Frasers in the New World ===

==== Seven Years War ====
Under the chief, Simon (who had led the Frasers in the '45 as the Master of Lovat) a regiment of Frasers, the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]], numbering fourteen hundred were raised and fought the [[Seven Years War|French and Indians]] in the [[Thirteen colonies|colonies]] and in [[Canada]], from [[1757]]-[[1759]]. Interestingly, the 78th fought under General Wolfe, who had previously fought at the Battle of Culloden, against Simon and perhaps some of the 78th. It was one of the 78th, possibly Simon, possibly one of his men, whose familiarity with the [[French language]] saved the first wave of British troops at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], which led to the capture of [[Quebec City|Quebec]].<ref name=harper/>

==== American rebellion ====
In the fight against [[American Revolutionary War|American independence]] Simon, who was by this time a General, raised twenty-three hundred men; the [[71st Fraser Highlanders]]. He recruited two battalions at [[Inverness]], [[Stirling]] and [[Glasgow]]. Most of the men were not Frasers for the number of Frasers had been substantially reduced after the battle of Culloden and the end of the clan system.<ref name=harper/>

==== Diaspora ====
Many Frasers settled in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] after the [[Seven Years' War|war against the French]] in [[Quebec]]. Many others later emigrated to those countries and to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (which have both had a Fraser [[Prime Minister]]). Frasers in the [[United States of America|U.S.]] have continued their proud military tradition, fighting on both sides of the [[American Civil War]]. Frasers from both sides of the Atlantic fought in the [[World War I|Great War]], and the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name=fraserchief>Saltoun, Lady Flora Fraser.
