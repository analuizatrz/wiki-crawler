'''Yoga''' ([[Devanagari]]: योग) is one of the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], focusing on [[meditation]] as a path to self-knowledge and liberation. [[Hindu]] texts establishing the basis for yoga include the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] and many others.<ref name=Knitter>Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 13)</ref><ref>Qigong: Essence of the Healing Dance - Page 268 by Garri Garripoli</ref> In India, Yoga is seen as a means to both physiological and spiritual mastery. Outside [[India]], Yoga has become primarily associated with the practice of [[asanas]] (postures) of [[Hatha Yoga]] (see [[Yoga as exercise]]), although it has influenced the entire [[dharmic religions]] family and other spiritual practices throughout the world.<ref name=Knitter/> A committed practitioner of yoga is referred to as a [[yogi]], [[yogin]] (masculine), or [[yogini]] (feminine).

The main branches of Yoga specificed in the Hindu texts, and generally accepted by both modern scholars and practitioners alike, include: [[Hatha Yoga]], [[Karma Yoga]], [[Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti Yoga]], and [[Raja Yoga]]. <ref name=yogaTrads1_042007>Pandit Usharbudh Arya (1985).

[[Image:Pashupati.gif|thumb|200px|right|A seal from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], showing a figure in meditation posture.]]

The first known written reference to yoga is in the [[Rig Veda]], estimated by Western scholars to be at least 3,500 years old.<ref>Frawley, David, ''Yoga and Buddhism''. Hinduism Today, February, 1998.</ref> The [[Upanishads]], (800-100 BCE), [[Bhagavad Gita]] (400-100 BCE), and the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] (200 BCE-300 CE) also discuss the concepts and teachings of yoga.

===Etymology===
[[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|[[:wikt:yoga|yoga]]}}'' is a derivation of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''yugam'', from a root ''yeug''- (Sanskrit ''yuj-'') meaning "to join" or "unite"; cognate to [[Latin]] ''iugum'' and modern [[English Language|English]] ''yoke''.

The term is attested since the [[Rigveda]] in the sense of "act of yoking, joining, attaching, harnessing" but also "undertaking, business, performance". A mental sense of "exertion, zeal, diligence" is attested since the [[Mahabharata]], and the spiritual or mystical sense of
"abstract contemplation, meditation" likewise appears in the Mahabharata as well as in the [[Upanishad]]s.

===Bhagavad Gita===
{{Main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The Bhagavad Gita ('Song of the Lord'), thought to have been written some time between 400 and 100 BCE, uses the term ''yoga'' extensively in a variety of senses.  Of many possible meanings given to the term in the Gita, most emphasis is given to these three:<ref>Flood, p. 96.</ref> 

*[[Karma yoga]]: The yoga of action
*[[Jnana yoga]]: The yoga of knowledge
*[[Bhakti yoga]]: The yoga of devotion

The influential commentator Madhusudana Sarasvati (b. circa 1490) divided the Gita's eighteen chapters into three sections, each of six chapters.  According to his method of division the first six chapters deal with Karma Yoga, which is the means to the final goal, and the last six deal with the goal itself, which he says is Knowledge (Jnana).  The middle six deal with bhakti.<ref>Gambhirananda, p. 16.</ref>  This system has been adopted by some later commentators and rejected by others.

===Yoga Sutras of Patanjali===
{{main|Patanjali|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
[[Image:Yogisculpture.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A sculpture of a [[Hindu]] yogi in the [[Birla Mandir]], [[Delhi]]]]
The [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] are a book of 196 aphorisms compiled by the sage [[Patanjali]] at some time between 200 BCE and 300 CE.

Patanjali's yoga is a form of [[Raja yoga]], as it seeks meditation as the path towards the ultimate goal. Patanjali himself referred to it as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"), from the eight steps he set out as the practical path towards attainment of enlightenment. This eight-limbed concept became an authoritative feature of Raja yoga from that point forward, and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today.
Patanjali's Eight Limbs of yoga practice are:
:(1) ''[[Yamas|Yama]]'' (The five "abstentions"): violence, lying, theft, (illicit) sex, and possessions
:(2) ''[[Niyama]]'' (The five "observances"): purity, contentment, austerities, study, and surrender to [[god]]
:(3) ''[[Asana]]'': Literally means "seat", and in Patanjali's Sutras refers to seated positions used for meditation. Later, with the rise of Hatha yoga, asana came to refer to all the "postures"
:(4) ''[[Pranayama]]'' ("Life Force Control"): Control of ''prāna'', life force, or vital energy
:(5) ''[[Pratyahara]]'' ("Abstraction"): Reversal of the sense organs
:(6) ''[[Dharana]]'' ("Concentration"): Fixing the attention on a single object
:(7) ''[[Dhyana]]'' ("Meditation"): Intense contemplation of the true nature of reality
:(8) ''[[Samadhi]]'' ("Liberation"): Super-conscious state of enlightenment

===Hatha Yoga Pradipika===
{{Main|Hatha yoga}}
[[Image:Bikram-choudhury.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Bikram Choudhury]] ca: [[1970]].]]
Hatha Yoga is a particular system of Yoga described by [[Yogi Swatmarama]], a yogic sage of the 15th century in India, and compiler of the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]. Hatha Yoga is a development of — but also differs substantially from — the [[Raja Yoga]] of Patanjali, in that it focuses on ''[[shatkarma]]'', the purification of the physical as leading to the purification of the mind (''ha'') and ''[[prana]]'', or vital energy (''tha'').<ref>Living Yoga: Creating a Life Practice - Page 42 by Christy Turlington (page 42)</ref><ref>Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers - Page 10 by Nancy Gerstein </ref> In contrast, the Raja Yoga posited by Patanjali begins with a purification of the mind (''yamas'') and spirit (''niyamas''), then comes to the body via ''[[asana]]'' (body postures) and ''[[pranayama]]'' (breath). Hatha yoga contains substantial [[tantra|tantric]] influence,<ref>Mindfulness Yoga: The Awakened Union of Breath Body & Mind - Page 6 by Frank Jude Boccio</ref><ref>Yoga: The Indian Tradition By Ian Whicher, David Carpenter (page 8)</ref> and marks the first point at which [[chakras]] and [[kundalini]] were introduced into the yogic canon. Compared to the seated asanas of Patanjali's Raja yoga which were seen largely as a means of preparing for meditation, it also marks the development of asanas as full body 'postures' in the modern sense.<ref name=Burley>Hatha Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice By Mikel Burley (page 16)</ref>

Hatha Yoga in its many modern variations is the style that most people actually associate with the word "Yoga" today.<ref>Feuerstein, Georg. (1996). ''The Shambhala Guide to Yoga''. Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, Inc.</ref> Because its emphasis is on the body through ''asana'' and ''pranayama'' practice, many western students are satisfied with the physical health and vitality it develops and are not interested in the other six limbs of the complete Hatha yoga teaching, or with the even older Raja Yoga tradition it is based on.

==Yoga philosophy==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
In all branches of yoga, the ultimate goal is the attainment of an eternal state of perfect consciousness. Within the [[Monism|monist]] schools of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Shaivism]] this perfection takes the form of ''[[Moksha]]'', which is a liberation from all worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death ([[Samsara]]) at which point there is a cessation of thought and an experience of blissful union with the Supreme [[Brahman]]. For the dualistic [[bhakti]] schools of [[Vaishnavism]], ''bhakti'' itself is the ultimate goal of the yoga process, wherein perfection culminates in an eternal relationship with [[Vishnu]] or one of his associated [[avatar]]s such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]].

Common to most forms of yoga is the practice of concentration (''[[dharana]]'') and [[meditation]] (''[[dhyana]]''). ''Dharana'', according to [[Patanjali|Patanjali's]] definition, is the "binding of consciousness to a single point." The awareness is concentrated on a fine point of sensation (such as that of the breath entering and leaving the nostrils). Sustained single-pointed concentration gradually leads to meditation (''dhyana''), in which the inner faculties are able to expand and merge with something vast. Meditators sometimes report feelings of peace, joy, and oneness.

The focus of '''meditation''' may differ from school to school, e.g. meditation on one of the ''[[chakra]]s'', such as the heart center (''[[anahata]]'') or the 'third eye' (''[[ajna]]''); or meditation on a particular deity, such as [[Krishna]]; or on a quality like [[peace]]. Non-dualist schools such as ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'' may stress meditation on the Supreme with no form or qualities (''[[Nirguna Brahman]]''). This is in many ways analogous to Buddhist meditation on [[Shunyata|Emptiness]].

==Yoga in other traditions==
The goals of yoga are expressed differently in different traditions. In [[Hinduism]], with its variegated viewpoints and sects, [[Self-Realization]] and [[God-Realization]] are used interchangeably, with the underlying belief that the true nature of self (truth, consciousness, and bliss), revealed through the practice of yoga, has the same nature as the universal self, which may or may not be identified with a 'creator God' depending on the philosophical standpoint of the practitioner. In [[Buddhism]], which does not postulate a creator-type god, yoga may help people deepen their [[wisdom]], [[compassion]], and [[insight]]. In Western nations, where there is a strong emphasis on [[individualism]], yoga practice may be an extension of the search for meaning in self, and integration of the different aspects of being. 

For the average person still far from enlightenment, yoga can be a way of increasing one's spiritual awareness, or cultivating [[compassion]] and [[insight]]. While the [[history of yoga]] strongly connects it with [[Hinduism]], some proponents claim that yoga is not a religion itself, but contains practical steps which can be found in the esoteric spiritual practices of all religions, as well as those who do not consider themselves religious.

===Yoga and Buddhism===
{{main | Yoga and Buddhism}}
The influence of Yoga pervades the whole of Buddhism.<ref name=Heisig>Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 22)</ref> In relation to views of the Self, yoga's ''asmita-samapatti'' is designed to eradicate wrong views of the Self much as Buddha did in ''Anatta-lakkhana-sutta''. Of particular interest is a comparison of the Buddhist [[eight-fold path]] and the eight limbs of Patanjali's Yoga. Their moral precepts (the ''sila'' of Buddhism, the ''yama'' and ''niyama'' of yoga) share the Hindu principle of non-violence (''ahimsa''); their final steps closely relate;<ref> 6. Buddhist ''Samma Vayama'' (Effort) & Yogic ''Dharana'' (Concentration), 7. Buddhist ''Samma Sati'' (Mindfulness) & Yogic ''Dhyana'' (Meditation) and 8. Buddhist ''Samma Samadhi'' & Yogic ''Samadhi''</ref> ultimately their steps lead to an indistinguishable goal - the cessation of mental fluctuations, ''citta vritti nirodha''.

====Yogacara Buddhism====
In addition [[Yogācāra]] (Sanskrit: "yoga practice"), also spelled yogāchāra, is an influential school of philosophy and psychology that developed in [[India]]n [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] starting sometime in the fourth to fifth centuries C.E., also commonly known as [[Consciousness-only]]. 

====Zen (Ch`an) Buddhism====
Zen is a form of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Mahayana school of Buddhism is noted for its proximity with Yoga.<ref name=Heisig/> In the west, Zen is often set alongside Yoga, the two schools of meditation display obvious family resemblances.<ref> Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (Page xviii) </ref> The melding of Yoga with Buddhism -- a process that continued through the centuries-- represents a landmark on the path of Yoga through the [[history of India]]. This phenomenon merits special attention since the Zen Buddhist school of meditation has its roots in yogic practices.<ref>Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 13).

ISBN 0941532895 [Exact quote: "This phenomenon merits special attention since yogic roots are to be found in the Zen Buddhist school of meditation."]</ref> Certain essential elements of Yoga are important both for Buddhism in general and for Zen in particular.<ref name=Knitter/>

====Tibetan Buddhism====
Yoga is central to [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In the [[Nyingma]] tradition, practicioners progress to increasingly profound levels of yoga, starting with [[Mahayoga|Mahā yoga]], continuing to [[Anuyoga|Anu yoga]] and ultimately undertaking the highest practice, [[Atiyoga|Ati yoga]]. In the [[Sarma]] traditions, the [[Anuttara yoga]] class is equivalent. Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm timing in movement exercises is known as [[Trul khor]] or union of moon and sun (channel) prajna energies, and the body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of [[Lukhang]].

===Yoga and Tantra===
{{Main|Tantra}}
Tantrism, is a practice that is supposed to alter the relation of the individual practitioner of Tantrism to the ordinary social, religious, and logical reality in which he or she lives. Through [[Tantric]] practice an individual perceives reality as [[maya]] , illusion, an the individual achieves liberation from it.<ref name=UCP>Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press,  1991. pp 313 </ref>

This particular path to salvation among the several offered by Hinduism, links Tantrism to those [[South Asian]] practices such as yoga, meditation, and social [[renunciation]], which are based on temporary or permanent withdrawal from social relationships and modes.<ref name=UCP/>

During tantric practices and studies, the student is instructed further in meditation technique, particularly [[Chakra|cakra meditation]]. This is often in a limited form in comparison with the way this kind of meditation is known and used by Tantric practitioners and yogis elsewhere, but is more elaborate than the initiate's previous meditation. It is considered to be a kind of [[Kundalini Yoga]] for the purpose of moving the Goddess into the cakra located in the "heart," for meditation and worship.<ref>Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press,  1991. pp 317 </ref>

In 1968, [[Yogi Bhajan|Harbhajan Singh Khalsa]], became a yoga instructor. He taught Kundalini Yoga, offered occasional "Tantric Yoga Intensives," and imposed upon his followers the structure and discipline of what he called "the healthy, happy, holy way of life." In 1970, the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (or [[3HO]]) was formally incorporated as a [[tax-exempt]] [[educational organization]]. Newly trained "student teachers" were sent to other cities in [[North America]] to teach Kundalini Yoga and to establish additional [[ashrams]]. During the early 1970s, the organization primarily sought to recruit new members through yoga classes and establish new ashrams.<ref>Divine Passions: The Social Construction of Emotion in India.
