'''Yves Coppens''' (born [[1934]]) is a French [[anthropology|anthropologist]]. He has studied ancient [[Hominidae|hominid]]s and has had multiple published works on this topic, and a film. He is one of the co-discoverers of [[Australopithecus afarensis|Lucy]].

The ''[[Rift Valley theory]]'', proposed and supported by the Dutch primatologist [[Adriaan Kortlandt]], became better known when it was later espoused and renamed by Coppens as the ''[[East Side Story]]''.

As [[Richard Dawkins]] says in ''[[The Ancestor's Tale]]'': "In his native France, Yves Coppens is widely cited as the discoverer of [[Australopithecus afarensis|Lucy]], even as the "father" of Lucy. In the English-speaking World, this important discovery is universally attributed to [[Donald Johanson]]." The actual founder of Lucy was an American student called [[Tom Gray (anthropologist)|Tom Gray]]. The mission was directed by the French geologist [[Maurice Taieb]], who discovered Lucy's locality: [[Hadar]] and founded the International Afar Research Expedition (IARE) in 1972, inviting Johanson and Coppens to join him as co-directors.

The discovery of Lucy rocked the anthropological world, as it showed that humans were bipedal over three million years ago.
