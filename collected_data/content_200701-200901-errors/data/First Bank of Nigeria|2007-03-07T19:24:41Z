'''First Bank Of Nigeria''' Is one of the top financial banks in [[Africa]] and one of the largest financial groups in Nigeria. First bank was the first major financial [[security]] institution founded in Nigeria. Hence the name First [[bank]] of Nigeria. It was originally called the Bank of British West Africa as it had a regional outlook. The current chairman is [[Umaru Mutallab]]. 
First bank was founded by a [[shipping]] magnate as a medium of financial security and to promote the use of silver currency or money against indigenous barter in Nigeria.

==History==
===Pre-Independence===
The Bank was founded in 1894 to cater to different sets of customers: The [[colonial]] trading companies and also the citizens of the colonies. The bank's mission originally focused on promoting [[currency]] use. According to the founder, the use of barter promoted a wide variety of medium of exchange without uniformity, leading to moral excess. A bank would guarantee security, and also a uniform standard of exchange. However, to many the bank was originally created as an institution to guarantee the financial security of British shipping and trading agencies in Nigeria. The founder Alfred Lewis Jones was a shipping magnate who originally had a monopoly on importing [[silver]] currency into west Africa through Elder Dempster. The bank acted initially as a financial security company meant to promote the use of silver currency and hence trading mostly in benefit of foreign goods. It did little lending to citizens but actually depended on the finances of [[citizens]] for deposits who had little collateral so it was hampered in its duties a financial bank. 
===Post-Indepedence===
After Nigeria's independence the bank's official outlook began to change. It had to treat its main customers better. A major initiative of the bank was to change its name from the Bank of British West Africa to the Bank of West Africa. The bank later merged with Standard Bank and was called Standard Bank of [[West Africa]]. In 1969, it was incorporated in Nigeria and called Standard bank of Nigeria. In 1979, after the government acquired shares in major expatriate banks, it was renamed First [[Bank]]. By then, the bank had re-organized it structure and had more indigenous directors than ever.
After independence the bank also began to extend more credit to its main customers. Also, more citizens began to trust British banks since they there was an 'independent' financial control mechanism and more citizens began to patronize the new Bank of West Africa.
