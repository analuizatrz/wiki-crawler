The '''Colorado potato beetle''' ('''''Leptinotarsa decemlineata)''''', also known as the '''Colorado beetle''', '''ten-striped spearman''', the '''ten-lined potato beetle''') is an important pest of potato crops. It is approximately 10&nbsp;mm (0.4&nbsp;inches) long, with a bright yellow/orange body and 5 bold brown stripes along the length of each of its [[elytron|elytra]], and it can easily be confused with its close cousin and look-alike, the [[false potato beetle]]. The beetle was described in 1824 by [[Thomas Say]] from specimens collected in the [[Rocky Mountains]] on buffalo-bur, ''[[Solanum rostratum]]''. The origin of the beetle is somewhat unclear, but it seems to be that [[Colorado]] and [[Mexico]] are a part of its native distribution in the southwestern North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/veg/leaf/potato_beetles.htm|title=Featured creatures: ''Leptinotarsa'' spp.|author=University of Florida (2007)|accessmonthday=11 August|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

==Life cycle==

==As a crop pest==
The Colorado beetle is a serious crop pest of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomatoes and eggplants. Both adults and larvae feed on foliage and may completely eliminate the crop. [[Insecticide]]s are currently the main method of beetle control on commercial farms. However, chemicals are often unsuccessful when used against this pest because of the beetle's resistance to [[toxin]]s and ability to rapidly develop [[pesticide resistance|resistance]] to them. The Colorado potato beetle has developed resistance to all major insecticide classes. In the [[United Kingdom]], where the Colorado beetle is a rare visitor on imported farm produce, it is a notifiable pest: any found must be reported to [[DEFRA]].

 

High fecundity usually allows Colorado potato beetle populations to withstand natural enemy pressure.  Still, in the absence of insecticides natural enemies can sometimes reach densities capable of reducing Colorado potato beetle numbers below economically damaging levels. [[Beauveria bassiana]] (Hyphomycetes) is a pathogenic fungus that infects a wide range of insect species, including the Colorado potato beetle. It is probably the most widely used natural enemy of the Colorado potato beetle, with readily available commercial formulations that can be applied using a regular pesticide sprayer.

==In Europe==

In 1877, the Colorado beetle reached Germany where it was eradicated. During, or immediately following WWI it became established near USA military bases in Bordeaux and proceeded to spread by the beginning of WWII to Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. The population increased dramatically during and immediately following WWII and it spread eastwards and it is now found over much of the continent. During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in [[Germany]], and many satellite states of [[Soviet Union]] used them for propaganda, claiming that the beetles had been dropped by the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. The Americans were also blamed by regime propaganda when after World War II, in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, almost half of all potato fields were infested by the beetle by 1950. In the EU it remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the UK, Republic of Ireland, Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not present in any of these Member States.

==Philately==
The [[Austria]]n postal authority featured the beetle on a 1967 stamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bugsonstamps.com/austria/austria_02_potato_beetle_796.htm|title=Skaps' bug stamps|author=James L. Skaptason|accessmonthday=1 May |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The Belgian postal authority featured a drawing of the Colorado beetle and larvae on a 1934 and 1935 propaganda postcard.

==Media references==
The beetle is featured prominently in the science-fiction/horror novel ''The Devil's Coach Horse'' (also known as ''The Black Horde'') by Richard Lewis. In the novel a plague of an evolved and flesh hungry type of the beetle (as well as the titular creature) is unknowingly released in Great Britain and the United States.
