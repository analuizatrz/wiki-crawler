'''''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] released by [[Raven Software]] and [[Activision]] in October 2006 in U.S. Previously referred to as '''Marvel Legends''', this game features more than 20 characters which are available to players and 140 character appearances in total. 

==Story==
Dr. Doom has formed a new [[Masters of Evil]] in pursuit of an unknown goal. When they then launch an attack on a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]], [[Nick Fury]] sends out a distress call to all available super heroes. [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] respond to the call, then proceed to eliminate Doom's forces, which are led by [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]], [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], and [[Fin Fang Foom]]. After saving the helicarrier, Fury is given the go-ahead by the government to create a special task force of super-humans to counter the Masters of Evil.

Their first mission is to investigate a mysterious message from [[Dum Dum Dugan]] on the Omega Base. Upon arriving, the team finds it under siege by [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.]], with the help of [[Crimson Dynamo]] and [[Mysterio]]. The team bests the three, takes out the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] and awakened Super Soldiers, and prevents the Omega Base from crashing into the dam, and prevent the gamma bombs from launching.

The team's next mission takes them to Atlantis (with the help of nano-technology that will enable them to breath underwater and move freely underwater), where the rioting inhabitants have ripped [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] off his throne. [[Attuma]] takes his place, with the Atlanteans under the influence of 3 Sonic Emitters placed in Atlantis, the first of which is guarded by [[Krang (comics)|Warlord Krang]] and [[Byrrah]]. After the Sonic Emitters are destroyed, the team fights Attuma and [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]]. Following the battle, they see The [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] deep in the catacombs, working for the Masters of Evil. He escapes with the "Tome of Asarius", but unleashes the [[Kraken (Marvel Comics)|Kraken]]. The heroes defeat it and pursue the Mandarin.

Prior to heading to battle, it is revealed that [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] was pretending to be the Mandarin at Dr. Doom's request. The team travels to The Valley of Spirits, where they encounter and recruit [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]. After defeating Mandarin, he claims he quit the Masters' weeks ago. He suggests that the Mandarin they saw in the catacombs was Loki, God of Mischief.

Nick Fury moves the base to Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, since Loki is now involved and the team will need the help of magic. The team learns that [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of the [[X-Men]] have been kidnapped. [[Professor X]]avier uses Cerebro to track them in Castle Doom in Latveria. The team teleports there, but upon arriving learns that [[Baron Mordo]] has disrupted Dr. Strange's Orb of Teleportation, which sends them to Murderworld, run by [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]. The team rescues Jean Grey, defeats [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], and Arcade (in his Arcade-Bot), and finds out more about Doom's plans. Arcade tells the team that Doom has used the Mutant Amplifier, stolen from the Omega Base, on Nightcrawler, so he can go to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s Realm.

The team travels to Mephisto's Realm, but [[Blackheart]]'s minions kidnap [[Jean Grey]] (who is sent to help Professor X create a mental shield around Nightcrawler) and Nightcrawler, the latter of whom had escaped from Doom's clutches. Blackheart puts them in separate cages above the Infinity Vortex. The team beats some Fire Giants, Mephisto's Pets, Demonic Souls, Demon Leapers, and Blackheart, but is faced with a difficult choice: Nightcrawler or Jean Grey? After an X-Man is saved and another is sacrificed, the team takes on Mephisto, who reveals that he traded his Twilight Sword for leading the heroes into his realm, saying that the Masters of Evil have "unique plans for Asgard."

Loki uses the Super Soldier Serum, stolen from the Omega Base, to create a massive army of Super Soldiers to attack Asgard, imprison the Asgardian Gods, and steal [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]'s throne. The team travels to Valhalla to use it as a new base. The team frees [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]] (who is guarded by Scorpion and [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]), [[Heimdall (Marvel Comics)|Heimdall]] (who is guarded by Rhino and Shocker), and [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]] from imprisonment. After defeating [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]], the team fights the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] to open Bifrost Bridge so reinforcements can arrive. Then the team travels to Niffleheim, fighting [[Kurse]] and [[Ulik]] along the way, to save Odin, who has gone to battle Loki's forces. Before defeating [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]], they find the Twilight Sword shattered. [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] claims that the only way it could have broken is that it was used on Odin. The team travels up to Raven's Spire (fighting [[Baron Mordo]] and [[Ultron]] along the way) and defeat Loki, and then travel back to Valhalla to free the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer Armor]]. Loki reveals that he created a land of his making to fool the super heroes into freeing the armor for him. The heroes prevail against Loki and the armor, but Dr. Doom appears, and reveals he stole Odin's power, and uses it to kill the team...

...Or so it seems. [[Uatu]] the Watcher saves them at the last second and transports them to the base of the [[Inhumans]] on the Moon. Uatu reveals the only way to beat Doom: find the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] (property of the [[Shi'ar]]) and steal the Muonic Inducer (from [[Galactus]] who is attacking the [[Skrull]]'s homeworld) and use them together against Doom.

The team travels to the Shi'ar empire, where [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] reveals that an upheaval has taken place. [[Deathbird]] has taken the throne (after overthrowing [[Lilandra Neramani]]) with the help of the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] ([[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]], [[Warstar]], [[Starbolt]], [[Hussar (comics)|Hussar]], [[Neutron (Marvel Comics)|Neutron]]), who you end up having to face throughout the level in order to get to Deathbird. After defeating Deathbird, she tries to destroy the ship, but the team saves the ship and retrieves a portion of the M'Kraan crystal in the process.

After retrieving the crystal, the team travels to the Skrull homeworld. The team disables Galactus' shield generators en route to trying to find the Muonic Inducer. During this they encounter the Skrull Empress, who betrays them and has [[Paibok]] and [[Super-Skrull]] attack. After the team defeats the Skrull duo, they encounter [[Titannus]], who they defeat before he can destroy more of the Skrull world. Then the [[Silver Surfer]] helps them defeat [[Galactus]].

While the heroes are doing this, Dr. Doom has conquered Earth and corrupted some of the heroes (including [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], and [[Psylocke]]) he defeated. Thus, turning them into evil versions of themselves and completely loyal to Dr. Doom. Upon arriving back at Stark Tower, the team finds that Doom has converted it into "Doomstark" tower, a corrupted version in his own vision of perfection. Doom sends an army of Iron Man-based robots to fend off the heroes, who defeat the robots and reactivate the tower for usage.

The team goes to Latveria (in a ship piloted by Nick Fury himself) and whilst there they defeat the corrupted evil heroes, and confront Dr. Doom, after first fighting against his bodyguards, cloned evil versions of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The heroes use the two devices obtained earlier to weaken Doom, making the team just powerful enough to defeat him. Upon being struck down by the heroes Doom is blasted by a bolt of lightning sent by a rejuvenated Odin, leaving nothing but his mask behind. Nick Fury congratulates the team on a job well-done, but is forced to disband the team. Captain America tells Nick Fury that they'll be ready to help when another major crisis occurs. Galactus, meanwhile, is angered by the theft of his property, and vows to destroy the planet (hence a hint for a sequel).

<b>NOTE</b>: If using the downloaded content to play as Doctor Doom, it is revealed the Doom that set up the Masters of Evil is from the future, after [[Ragnarök|Ragnarok]] killed the Asgardians.

===Future===
After the game, Uatu tells the player of how his/her actions in the game (such as not completing missions the right way, or not completing side missions) have changed the future. Here are the futures that Uatu explains:

* If the player prevents the Super Soldiers from destroying the S.H.I.E.L.D. Omega Base computer that contains research data on the [[Legacy Virus]], it's information will lead to a cure several years later that will save the mutant race from possible extinction. If not, the mutant race may go extinct.
* If the player succeeds in finding rare seaweed as one of the ingredients to a medicine that will heal Namor, he will begin to trust surface-dwellers and join a world-wide organization of superheroes (a reference to the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]] in the final shot of that). Otherwise, war between Atlantis and the surface world may ensue.
* If the player succeeds in saving [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] from within Murderworld, he would sponsor the Mutant Aid bill and funding schools similar to Professor X's school to train young mutants how to control their powers. If Senator Kelly isn't rescued, he will instate a bill where all mutants are forced to go to re-educational camps so they will be educated to NOT use their powers.
* If the player chooses to save Jean Grey from being dropped into the Infinity Vortex, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] will avenge Nightcrawler by infiltrating the [[X-Mansion]] at night to vent her frustration upon Professor X where he will die in a coma months later and the X-Men will be forever disbanded. If the player saves Nightcrawler from being dropped into the Infinity Vortex, Jean Grey will return with a vengeance as the Dark Phoenix against those who did not save her (Saving Nightcrawler is the lesser of the two evils for all that would happen is the heroes would have to face the Dark Phoenix alongside [[Mephisto]]).
* If the player finds Valkyrie's sword, Asgard will be easily freed with her aid, Loki is imprisoned, and Ragnarok never comes to pass. If the player doesn't find her sword, Valkyrie and Balder fall in battle during the prevention of Ragnarok and the people of Asgard are forbidden to contact Earth for over a century or two.
* If the player finds [[Volla (Marvel Comics)|Volla]]'s ring, she will warn Odin about an attempt on his life orchestrated by [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] which will lead to the fire demon's capture. If not, then Odin will be killed, Lady Sif dies in battle, and Thor will rule Asgard as the greatest of the gods. 
* If the player saves Lilandra Neramani from Deathbird, the Shi'ar will give Earth their advance technology that will wipe out Earth's diseases and hunger and the Shi'ar technology will enable the people of Earth to build colonies on other planets. If the player doesn't succeed, the Shi'ar will refuse to help the heroes when an asteroid comes to destroy the Western coast of the United States.
* If the player saves the Skrull homeworld from destruction, the Skrulls will form a tentative partnership with Earth and later come to the aid of Earth's heroes when the [[Kree]] plan an invasion upon Earth. Otherwise, the Kree and the Skrull will form a tentative alliance and will wage war on Earth which will cost millions of lives.
* If the player saves Odin from imprisonment in one of Doctor Doom's machines, he will help Thor prevent [[Thanos]] from taking over Earth and enslaving it. If the player doesn't, he won't help Thor fight Thanos and Earth will be enslaved for centuries.
* If the player successfully finds the damaged [[Ultimate Nullifier]] in Castle Doom, [[Mister Fantastic]] will repair it and use it one day to prevent Mephisto from entering Earth and invading it before all is lost. If the Nullifier isn't found, Mephisto is still repelled, but only after heavy casualties.

===Subplot===
During the game a subplot takes place where [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]] attempts to find proof that the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] is a double agent, and the player needs to obtain various pieces of information to aid his efforts. Ultimately the players call Nick Fury with information of Black Widow's apparent betrayal, it is revealed that Black Widow is innocent and her suspicious activities were part of an operation to try and retrieve plans that Dr. Doom had stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. The plan, Operation: All Father was created for if the Asgardians became threats to humans and involved stealing Odin's power with the Twilight Sword, which is exactly what Doom does. After the closing credits, there is also a dialogue between Weasel and Black Widow, with Weasel going into S.H.I.E.L.D. records for her. During this it is revealed that Black Widow is indeed some kind of double agent, and she has set up Weasel for the fall when S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents come to arrest Weasel.

==Features==
The game features over 140 characters from the Marvel Universe. Players are able to create teams, and have online and co-operative play, for up to 4 players. In arcade mode players will have to fight for the most kills in order to get the experience points at the end of the level. There are also special comic book missions, revisiting a moment in a character's past and facing a classic arch rival. Characters may have up to four costumes, which can alter the stats of the character.

Players will fight in mid air, underwater and on the ground, with fully destructible and interactive environments in over 17 locations, traveling around different locales on planet Earth, different dimensions, and even the depths of space by the end of the game. The game has alternative endings, affected by the decisions the player(s) make throughout the game. These endings are based on whether or not the player chooses to complete optional missions.

The game is quite rewarding for fans of Marvel's characters, providing lots of bonuses and nods to knowledgeable fans who know their comic history. Putting together teams of characters who have a shared history together, for example, may give team bonuses (ex. using [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Ms. Marvel]] on the same team would yield you the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], giving you a boost in attack damage for all team members). Most teams are not taken from the comics but involve choosing characters with something in common. For instance, Thor, Storm, Human Torch and Iceman form Natural Forces, and any all-female team creates Femme Fatale. Using particular characters to interact with other NPCs can also yield additional dialogue, and villains will also react accordingly when met with their nemeses (for example, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] will talk directly to [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] or [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] upon seeing those characters in the first chapter). The game also features trivia games, artwork and many more references to the Marvel Universe.

While many characters in the game by default are rendered with the appearance they have in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics, the world of the game is predominantly based upon that of the [[Earth 616|original Marvel Universe]], with many villains, character designs and references to events that exist only in that continuity (for example, [[Galactus]] is the original Marvel Universe's version, not Ultimate Marvel's hive-minded robotic version), and Shocker's design is the classic one, rather than his Ultimate one.

==Versions==
The game is available for the [[Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Wii]] and [[PC]]. The graphical engine and looks differ between the various platforms. For the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[Xbox]], and [[Wii]], characters models are similar to ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse|X-Men Legends II]]'' style. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions feature more detailed character models and environments. The PC version vary depending on the customization of a user's settings, at maximum settings and shaders with premium hardware, the PC graphics will be similar to or better than the 7th gen. The PC version also features "intuitive mouse controls" <ref>[http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/game_info.php Marvel: Ultimate Alliance official site]</ref> and works with a gamepad.

===PC===
The PC version, like most PC games, is customisable, and many characters and their skins from the X-Men Legends games, like Psylocke and Emma Frost, have been uploaded to modding sites for play within the game.

==Characters==
While ''Ultimate Alliance'' follows in the footsteps of Raven Software's ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' games, it has a broader scope of inclusion, adding playable heroes from [[Marvel Comics]]' other popular comics, including [[Spider-Man]], many different members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the entire [[Fantastic Four]]. In addition, each character has four different costumes, except for Moon Knight, who has three. Most of these extra costumes are different costumes characters have had in their comics appearances; for example, Spider-Man has his black symbiote costume and his red and gold [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|"Iron Spider"]] costume, as well as his classic red and blue costume. Some of the costumes are alternate versions of the same character or even entirely separate characters with similar powers or appearance: for example, many characters appear in their [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] versions, and both versions of the character [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] as well as the [[MC2]] character [[Spider-Girl]] are available via the costume change feature.  Some costume changes are also renditions of the character in other media.  For example, [[Blade (comics)|Blade's]] "Daywalker" costume is the take on the Blade character during his [[Blade: The Series|short lived live action series]].

One major fact to note is that the version of Nick Fury used for Alliance is not the same as previously appeared in the X-Men Legends game, instead being the classic original Nick Fury. However, the [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] model that was previously used is still available as an alternate costume for Fury, with both Nick Fury versions having two costumes each.

While all versions of ''Ultimate Alliance'' share a common core of initially-available and unlockable characters, many of the different versions have exclusive characters. The PC, [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox]] versions have only the basic core, while the PlayStation Portable version adds four characters, the Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and Wii versions share a pair of exclusive characters, and the Game Boy Advance version has two exclusive characters while lacking some of the core unlockable characters, and most of the base selection.

The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] was going to be the final playable character, but as the rights to use the character are held by [[Sierra Entertainment]], this was not possible. However, the player meets Bruce Banner in the Omega Base & sees a defeated Hulk in a cinematic prior to the final mission. The character is available for download on the Xbox 360 online market place.

As of March 23rd, it has been announced that the 360 version of the game will feature new content with 8 characters that updates them with costumes, special powers, and voice dialog for the game.  The new expansion pack will include 4 heroes The Hulk, Cyclops, Hawkeye, and Nightcrawler as well as 4 villans Doctor Doom, Magneto, Venom, and Sabretooth.  It was announced on the 23rd April 2007 that the DLC would be available sometime during the week.  After much delay, the Playable Hero and Villains Packs were released on April 26.

There is currently no word on if these characters will be made available for the PS3, Wii or PC.

[[Image:MarvelUltimateAllianceScreen.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain America]].]]

 
Characters that appear as alternate costumes are listed under the original character.<br>
:''All playable characters have four different costumes, except [[Moon Knight]], who has three.''.<br>
:''In the case of [[Nick Fury]], Two of his four represent [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]]''.
:''In the case of [[Silver Surfer]], all of his alternate costumes look the same.''
All characters in italics are costume changes for other characters that are of different personas altogether. Daredevil, Black Panther, Nick Fury, Silver Surfer, Dr Strange, Ghost Rider and Blade are not available at the beginning of the game; some of them have to be unlocked by completing/collecting specific items whereas the rest are unlocked as you meet the characters in the game.

==Reception==
The reviews were generally positive for the PC, Xbox 360, PS3, Xbox, PS2, and PSP versions of the game. Reaction to the Wii version was generally mixed, saying the motion controls felt "tacked on". The GBA version was poorly recieved for having poor graphics, bad sound, all characters being pretty much the same, poor gameplay, and the games length.
