'''Runcorn''' is an industrial town within the [[Halton (borough)|borough of Halton]], in the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Cheshire]], [[England]]. With a population of 59,360,<ref name="pop2004">[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/councilanddemocracy/council/research/factbook?a=5441 Halton Unitary in Figures]</ref> Runcorn is located on the southern bank of the [[River Mersey]] where the estuary narrows to form [[River Mersey#Runcorn Gap|Runcorn Gap]]. Directly to the north across the Mersey is the town of [[Widnes]]. Upstream and eight&nbsp;miles (13&nbsp;km) to the east is the town of [[Warrington]], and downstream sixteen&nbsp;miles (22.5&nbsp;km) to the west is the city of [[Liverpool]]. 

Runcorn lies on the [[West Coast Main Line]] and the [[A533 road]]. The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] runs between the town and the River Mersey and the [[Bridgewater Canal]] passes through and ends in the town at its junction with the Manchester Ship Canal. 

Runcorn was a small isolated village until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries it was a [[Spa town|health resort]].<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'' pp. 133-137.</ref>  During the 19th century various industries developed, in particular the manufacture of [[soap]] and [[alkali]], [[quarry]]ing, [[shipbuilding]] and [[tanning]]. In the early 20th century the prime industries were those of [[Chemical industry|chemicals]] and tanning. The original village had grown to include the outlying villages of [[Halton, Cheshire|Halton]], Weston, Weston Point, Norton and Clifton (formerly Rocksavage). The arrival of the New Town to the east of the existing town led to a doubling of the population from around 30,000 to its present level, and to a diversification of its industries. 

==Geography==
[[image:arms-runcorn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Arms of the former Runcorn Urban District Council.]]
===Physical geography===
Runcorn is situated on a spur projecting into the River Mersey which flows to the north of the town and then to its west. On the north back of the river is another spur which forms the West Bank area of Widnes; together these form Runcorn Gap, a narrowing of the River Mersey. Runcorn Gap is crossed by [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]], carrying the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line, and the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]], carrying the A533 road. To the south of the town is the [[River Weaver]] and the Weston Canal which open into the Ship Canal. To the south-east of the town run the [[M56 motorway]], the [[Chester to Manchester Line|Chester-Manchester railway line]] and the main branch of the West Coast Main Line.  The town has a system of [[expressway]]s, roads which divert the through traffic from the residential areas of the town. The Central Expressway runs through the centre of the area now comprising Runcorn in a north-south direction.  To the west of it lie most of the former settlements which formed the older part of the town, namely Runcorn, Higher Runcorn, Weston, Weston Point and Clifton (formerly Rocksavage), and the New Town areas of Halton Brook and Halton Lodge.  To the east are the village of Halton, the old settlements of Norton and Stockham and the New Town areas of Castlefields, Palacefields, Windmill Hill, Murdishaw, Brookvale and Hallwood Park.<ref>[[Ordnance Survey]], ''Explorer'' 275 map</ref>

The density of housing is generally high but there are open green areas, in particular [[Heath (habitat)|heathland]] on Runcorn Hill and an extensive Town Park which was created as part of the New Town.  The older industries, particularly the remaining chemical factories, are concentrated mainly to the south-west of the town bordering the Mersey while newer industries, including [[warehouse|warehousing]] are to the north-east and south-east.  A second crossing of the Mersey is planned, to be known as the ''Mersey Gateway''.<ref>[http://www.merseygateway.co.uk/ Mersey Gateway]</ref>
===Geology===
Drainage of the Runcorn area is into the Mersey to the north and into the Weaver to the south.  The [[bedrock]] of the western and north-eastern parts of the town is comprised of rock from the Sherwood [[sandstone]] group; in the other areas the bedrock is from the Mercia [[mudstone]] group.  In places there are prominent [[outcrop]]s of sandstone, particularly at Runcorn Hill and Halton Hill, which provide extensive views in all directions.  Elsewhere the bedrock is covered by [[Drift (geology)|drift]].  At the north-west periphery of the town there is recent blown [[sand]], further to the east and bordering the Mersey is recent [[alluvium]] and elsewhere the drift consists of [[till]].<ref>Phillips, pp. 4-5.</ref>
===Climate===
Being close to the west coast and the [[Irish Sea]], the climate is generally [[temperate]] with few extremes of temperature or weather.  The mean average temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif Met. Office:Average annual mean temperature]</ref> as is the average amount of sunshine.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif Met. Office:Average annual sunshine]</ref> The average annual rainfall is slightly below the average for the UK.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif Met. Office:Average annual rainfall]</ref>  There are very few days when snow is lying on the ground<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/dl/17.gif Met. Office:Days of snow lying]</ref> and days of air frost are also few<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/daf/17.gif Met. Office:Days of air frost]</ref>
==Government==
===Civic history===

At the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey Runcorn was in the [[hundred]] of Tunendune<ref>Phillips, p. 27</ref> but later, and until the early 19th century, Runcorn was part of the Bucklow hundred.<ref>Phillips, p. 9.</ref>  Under the Runcorn Improvement Act of 1852 a board of [[Improvement commissioners|Improvement Commissioners]] was established to administer the civil government of the town.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p. 193.</ref>  By the [[Local Government Act 1894]] the administration of the town and the surrounding areas were divided into Runcorn [[Urban District]] and Runcorn [[Rural District]].  Initially the urban district consisted of only the built-up area of Runcorn itself.  By 1937 the area had been extended to include the communities of Weston and Weston Point to the west and by 1971 it had been further extended to the east to incorporate the village of Halton.<ref>Phillips, p. 11.</ref>

In 1964 Runcorn was designated as a [[New town#United Kingdom|New Town]]. In 1974, as part of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], Runcorn Urban District was abolished and its territory amalgamated with [[Widnes]] to form the borough of Halton which is a [[unitary authority]] within the ceremonial county of Cheshire.

===Political representation===
Following the [[Reform Act 1832]] Runcorn was placed in the Northern Division of the Cheshire [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] [[constituency]] and from 1868 in the Mid-Cheshire constituency.  From 1885 to 1950 the town was in the constituency of Northwich.<ref>Phillips, pp. 102-103.</ref>  By an [[act of Parliament]] in 1948 the constituency of Runcorn was created and in 1950 Runcorn's first [[Member of Parliament]], [[Dennis Vosper, Baron Runcorn|Dennis Vosper]], was elected.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p. 221.</ref> He continued to represent the constituency until 1964 when he was succeeded by [[Mark Carlisle]].

Runcorn is now in the [[European Parliament|European parliamentary]] constituency of [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]]. The  UK parliamentary constituency is [[Halton (UK Parliament constituency)|Halton]] and the current Member of Parliament is [[Derek Twigg]].<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/councilanddemocracy/mps?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: MPs]</ref>  The local authority is the borough of Halton and the town is divided into ten [[Ward (politics)|electoral wards]].<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/localdemocracy/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Local Democracy]</ref>

==History==
===Etymology===
The earliest reference is in the ''Saxon Chronicle'' where the name is ''Rumcofan''.  This name derives from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words ''r√∫m'', meaning wide or broad, and ''cofa'', meaning cave or cove, the whole meaning a wide cove or bay.  Subsequent spellings have been ''Rumcoven'', ''Ronchestorn'', ''Runckhorne'' and ''Runcorne'', finally becoming the modern name of Runcorn.<ref>Nickson, p. 5, Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p. 4.</ref>

===Early history===
Little is known about the early history of the settlement but isolated findings of objects from the [[Stone Age|Stone]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s have been made and there is evidence of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] presence in the area.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 1-4.</ref>  The earliest recorded event in its history is the building by [[Ethelfleda]], daughter of [[Alfred the Great]], of a fortification at Runcorn to protect the northern frontier of her kingdom against the [[Viking]]s in 915. The fort was built on Castle Rock overlooking the river at Runcorn Gap.<ref>Nickson, pp. 6-13. The foundations of the fort were discovered during the building of the railway bridge but were covered by an abutment of the bridge.</ref>

Following the [[Norman conquest]], Runcorn was not mentioned in the [[1086]] [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey, though the surrounding settlements of Halton, Weston, Aston, Norton and Eanley were. [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] granted the [[Earl of Chester|earldom of Chester]] to [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh d'Avranches]] who in turn granted the [[Barons of Halton|barony of Halton]] to Nigel.  It is likely that Nigel erected a [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]] on Halton Hill in the 1070s.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 7-8.</ref> 

In 1115, Nigel's son, William Fitznigel, founded an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at Runcorn. In 1134 the monks moved the priory to Norton, about 3.5 miles (5.5 km) away. The barons of Halton provided [[Norton Priory]] with substantial amounts of money until around 1200. In 1391 the priory was raised to the higher status of [[abbey]].<ref>Greene, pp. 1-9.</ref> In 1536 the monastery was dissolved, and around nine years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to [[Sir Richard Brooke]] who converted the habitable part of the abbey into a home for himself and his family.<ref>Greene, p. 151, Nickson, p. 39.</ref>

===Civil War===
During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] Halton Castle was held for the crown by John Savage, 2nd [[Earl Rivers]], the Steward of Halton. It fell twice to Parliamentarian [[Roundheads]]. The first siege was led by [[Sir William Brereton]] in 1643, the second a year later. Stone blocks removed from the castle would have been used to build many of the still existing houses in Halton village. Following the Civil War, the castle was purchased by Colonel Henry Brooke of Norton Priory. However, it was only held by the Brooke family for a short period of time, as it was returned to the Duchy after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 57-58</ref>

According to a writer in 1656, Runcorn was "nothing but a fair parish church, a parsonage and a few scattered tenements".<ref>King, Daniel, ''The Vale Royal of England'', 1656.</ref>  And so it remained for over a century, an isolated and poor hamlet.  The only through traffic was the [[ferry]] which crossed from Runcorn to the north bank of the River Mersey.  Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early years of the 19th century the town was renowned as a health resort where invalids came to take the air and to convalesce from illness.  This was all to change with the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

During the 18th century water transport had been improved in the area by the Mersey and [[Irwell]] Navigation between [[Manchester]] and Warrington.  By 1773 the [[Bridgewater Canal]] linking Runcorn with Manchester was open throughout its length.  In 1777 a link was made with the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at [[Preston Brook]].  This gave Runcorn waterway connections with most of the interior of England through the [[canal]] system and with the sea along the River Mersey, thus forming the basis for the development of the [[Port of Runcorn]].  In 1804 the Runcorn to [[Latchford]] canal (popularly known as the Old Quay canal) was completed which provided an improved link with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation.<ref>Starkey, ''Schooner Port'', pp. 19-24, ''Old Runcorn'', pp.125-130.</ref>  Then in 1810 the Weston Canal was completed which provided access from the River Weaver to the Mersey avoiding the difficult entrance at the mouth of the Weaver. This navigation system led to [[Northwich]] and [[Winsford]] and so provided easier access to the [[salt]] fields of central Cheshire.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p. 173.</ref>

Various industries began to develop within and around the town, in particular [[quarrying]] for Runcorn [[sandstone]], [[shipbuilding]], the manufacture of [[soap]] and [[chemicals]] and [[tanning]].  The major soap manufacturers in the town were the [[John & Thomas Johnson]] and [[Hazlehurst & Sons]].<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 147-159.</ref>  Both were making [[alkali]] using the [[Leblanc process]] by 1830 and in the 1830s both businesses were in the top 20 of the soap making firms in the United Kingdom.<ref>Vardy, P. I. 'Thomas Hazlehurst and his family', ''Cheshire History'', 45:2005-2006, pp. 71.</ref>  Runcorn was becoming an industrialised and highly [[polluted]] town.
[[Image:Runcorn soapworks.jpg|thumb|Soap and alkali works during the 19th century]]
During the 19th century the town became increasingly dominated by the chemical and tanning industries.  In 1868 the [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]] was opened across the Mersey, giving Runcorn direct rail links with [[Liverpool]] and the rest of the country via [[Crewe]].<ref>Nickson, p. 206.</ref>  In the 1880s a [[brine]] pipeline was opened between Northwich and Weston Point, supplying the salt works and nearby chemical works.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 160-162.</ref>  Soon after followed the construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] which was opened throughout its length in 1894.<ref>Starkey, ''Schooner Port'', p. 184.</ref>  This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as [[Salford]], some of them calling at the port of Runcorn.  The large rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the subsequent drop by 1901 is explained by the enormous number of people involved in constructing the ship canal at that time.  In 1905 the [[Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge]] opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.<ref>Thompson, ''Bridging the Years'', p.17.</ref>

===Recent history===
During the first half of the 20th century the industry of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning.  In 1926 a number of chemical companies merged to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).  As the century progressed there was a degree of diversification of industry. In 1961 the Transporter Bridge was replaced by Runcorn Bridge (also known as the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]]) which allowed a more efficient means of road traffic across Runcorn Gap.

Major changes were to come with the designation of Runcorn [[New Town]] in 1964. The tanneries had been declining for a long time and the last one (Highfield) closed in 1968.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p. 221.</ref>  The chemical industry has also declined in the town while there has been a development of many types of light industry in the area of the Old Town and around the outskirts of the New Town. In 1964 Runcorn New Town was designated. In 1974 Runcorn Urban District merged with the [[Widnes|Borough of Widnes]] to form the [[Halton (borough)|Borough of Halton]].

==Landmarks and places of interest==
[[Image:Halton Castle.jpg|thumb|Halton Castle]]
The major landmark in the town is Halton Castle which stands on the top of Halton Hill near to the centre of the present town. Only ruins are now present but there are widespread views from the top of the hill.  The interior of the castle grounds are open at advertised times.<ref>[http://www.haltoncastle.org Halton Castle]</ref>  Incorporated in the castle walls is the Castle Hotel which at one time incorporated a courthouse on the first floor.  Another prominent landmark is Norton water tower, a structure built of Runcorn sandstone, 34 metres high, which holds 672,000 gallons of water and which is involved in the supply of water to Liverpool.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p. 162.</ref>

An important historical site and the major visitor centre in the town is Norton Priory which is now run as a museum.  The site contains the remains of the priory with adjacent gardens which used to be those of the country house.  Nearby are a [[walled garden]] which includes the national collection of tree [[quince]]s and an [[Icehouse (building)|ice house]].<ref>[http://www.rossbullock.co.uk Norton Priory 1]</ref><ref name="np2">[http://www.nortonpriory.org Norton Priory 2]</ref>
[[Image:Runcorn All Saints 1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|All Saints Parish Church]]
Much of the architecture of the town is undistinguished but there are a number of [[Listed buildings in Runcorn, Cheshire|listed buildings]], many of them in Halton village and others are scattered throughout the town.  The major churches are All Saints Parish Church and Holy Trinity Church in the Old Town centre, St Mary's in Halton village, St John's in Weston and Christ Church in Weston Point.  The oldest existing houses are the Seneschal's house, Halton village (1598), Weston Old Hall (1607), Brookfield Farmhouse (1691) and Halton Old Hall (1693).  Other outstanding houses include Runcorn Town Hall (formerly Halton Grange), Camden House and Cottage in High Street, and Bridgewater House near the Ship Canal.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/environment/planning/forwardplanning/listedconservationareas/listedbuildings?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Listed buildings in Halton]</ref>

The [[war memorial]] to the men who served in both [[world war]]s is sited at the top of Greenway Road. There is also a memorial in Castle Road, Halton village, commemorating residents of the village who served in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].

There is some [[public art|public sculpture]] in the town.  In High Street in the Old Town centre is Runcorn Spire, a metal structure which represents many of the features of the history of the town.  In Mersey Road, overlooking the Ship Canal, is a boat-shaped sculpture with the head of Ethelfreda as its figurehead.  On the top of the new market hall in the Old Town centre is Runcorn Dome which represents the old shipping and chemical industries. Although it is not a sculpture, a large [[Glacial erratic|erratic boulder]] which was left by the retreat of the [[glacier]]s in the [[Ice Age]] is used as a decorative feature in the New Town.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', opposite p. 1</ref>

==Demographics==
Separate statistics are not published for the town of Runcorn but are incorporated in the total figures for the unitary authority of Halton.

==Economy==
Traditionally the industries of Runcorn were chemicals, tanning, quarrying, engineering and ship building.  All but the chemical industry have disappeared.  The chemical industry was dominated by ICI but this has now been taken over by [[Ineos]].  In Runcorn this company manufactures many chemicals including [[chlorine]] and chlorine-containing compounds including [[vinyl chloride]], heavy chemicals including [[alkali]]s and [[flourine]] containing compounds.  A separate business within the same company manufactures salt from [[brine]] transported by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] from the saltfields of central Cheshire.<ref>[http://www.ineos.com/index.php Ineos]</ref>  The former ICI offices and laboratories now comprise The Heath Business and Technical Park which provides office, laboratory, conference and leisure facilities.<ref>[http://www.theheath.com/ The Heath Business and Technical Park]</ref>  To the east of the town many diverse industries have been developed including, because of the proximity to the motorway system, a number of [[warehouse]]s and distribution centres.  
[[Image:Runcorn High Street.jpg|thumb|Runcorn High Street]]
Somewhat unusually, Runcorn has two shopping centres. Historically the shopping area was in what is now the Old Town centre and was based in High Street, Regent Street and Church Street.  This continues to exist, but with the coming of the New Town, has considerably diminished.  There is a small supermarket and there are some specialist shops but a higher than average proportion of [[charity shop]]s and [[Take-out|take-away]] food outlets.  [[Halton Lea]] (formerly called Shopping City) is an enclosed [[shopping mall]] with an attached bus station.  Adjacent to it is Trident Park containing more shopping outlets and a cinema and a little further away is an [[ASDA]] supermarket.

==Culture==
===Theatre and cinema===
''[[The Brindley]]'' is a modern theatre and arts centre situated in the Old Town Centre named after [[James Brindley]], engineer of the adjacent Bridgewater Canal.  It contains a [[proscenium]] theatre seating 420 and a smaller multi-purpose theatre seating 108, ''The Studio'', which doubles as a cinema.  There is an exhibition space for art installations, a small caf√© and a number of separate rooms for different purposes.  The theatre is owned and administered by Halton Borough Council and in addition to theatre, cinema and art the council runs a large number of community events in the building.<ref>[http://www.thebrindley.org.uk/ The Brindley]</ref>

A [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex cinema]] run by [[Cineworld]] is sited in Trident Park, adjacent to Halton Lea.

===Filmography===
Runcorn has been used frequently for the shooting of films and television programmes.  Some of the sequences of the first two series of the [[BBC]] police drama ''[[Merseybeat (TV series)|Merseybeat]]'' were filmed in and around the town.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/merseybeat/ BBC: Merseybeat]</ref>  The BBC [[situation comedy]] ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]'' is set in Runcorn. External shots of the Waterloo Hotel in the area of High Street known as Top Locks (which is known in the show as The Archer) appear in that show and the opening credits show the Silver Jubilee Bridge and Halton Castle.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/twopints/ BBC: Two Pints]</ref>  ''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous]]'', a four-part comedy drama on [[BBC Three]], was also set in Runcorn.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/gorgeous/ BBC: Drop Dead Gorgeous]</ref>  The interior of the Undercroft at Norton Priory has been used to depict various locations in a number of films.<ref name="np2"/>

==Communal facilities==
===Libraries===
The main library is at Halton Lea with a branch library in Egerton Street in the Old Town centre (which includes the archives of the Runcorn & District Historical Society).<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/tourismandleisure/libraries/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: Libraries]</ref>

===Parks and nature reserves===
[[Image:Runcorn Hill 2.jpg|thumb|Runcorn Hill]]
Runcorn Hill Local Nature Reserve has been developed on the site of a former quarry and now consists of heathland. Adjacent to it is a formal park which includes a [[bandstand]], boating lake and sports facilities. Wigg Island is a [[nature reserve]] which has been developed on a site previously occupied by industry.  It lies on an island between the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey and consists of open spaces and woodland with paths for walking and bird hides.  Murdishaw Valley is an area of [[ancient woodland]] to the east of the town between the Murdishaw housing development and the M56. Rock Park has also been developed on the site of a former quarry in the Old Town area and includes sports facilities. Town Park is in the centre of the New Town development and links to the north with Norton Priory.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/environment/parksandopenspaces/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council Parks, open spaces and countryside]</ref>  Some of the open areas of Runcorn form part of Mersey Forest which is one of Britain's [[Community Forests in England|community forests]].<ref>[http://www.merseyforest.org.uk/ Mersey Forest]</ref>

===Sports and leisure venues===
Runcorn Sports Club is a privately run sports club in Moughland Lane and provides facilities and coaching for cricket and hockey. Halton Sports Club is in Murdishaw Avenue. There is a privately run swimming pool in Beechwood local centre and another at Stockham Lodge Raquet and Health Club. Adjacent to the latter is are two [[artificial ski slope]]s administered by Runcorn Ski Centre.<ref>[http://www.runcornskicentre.co.uk/ Runcorn Ski Centre]</ref> Runcorn Rowing Club rows on the River Weaver Navigation near Clifton Village.<ref>[http://www.runcornrowingclub.org.uk/ Runcorn Rowing Club]</ref>  
Centres run by the local authority include Brookvale Recreation Centre which has a range of indoor sporting facilities, Phoenix Park which has a wide range of outdoor sporting facilities and Runcorn Swimming Pool.<ref name="sports">[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/tourismandleisure/sports?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Sports in Halton]</ref>

When the approach roads to the Silver Link Bridge were built, the link between the terminus of the Bridgewater canal and the line of locks which used to connect it to the Ship Canal was severed.  It is hoped that if the building of the second road bridge crossing the Mersey, the ''Mersey Gateway'', goes ahead, it will be feasible to reopen this link and to restore the locks.  This would open the possibility of a second "Cheshire Ring" linking the Bridgewater canal to the Manchester Ship Canal, then via the Weaver Navigation to Anderton.  Here the boats would be raised by the [[Anderton Boat Lift]] to the Trent and Mersey canal which would take them back to Bridgewater canal.<ref>[http://www.runcornlocks.org.uk Runcorn Locks Restoration Society]</ref>

===Health===
Runcorn's hospital is Halton Hospital which is administered by the North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust.  This hospital is currently undergoing considerable change.  Originally planned as a [[Hospital#Types|District General Hospital]], it was never large enough to provide a full range of services.  Acute medical services have been transferred to Warrington Hospital and it is planned to provide non-emergency surgery and rehabilitation at Halton Hospital.<ref>[http://www.northcheshirehospitals.nhs.uk/ North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust]</ref>

[[Primary care]] services are provided by the Halton and St Helens [[NHS Primary Care Trust|Primary Care Trust]].  This is also in a state of change following the recent merger of the Halton and the St Helens Primary Care Trusts.  In Runcorn [[general practitioner]] services are provided in five health centres and in one separate medical practice in Heath Road.  There are dental practices providing a mixture of National Health Service and private dental care.<ref>[http://www.halton-health.nhs.uk/ Halton and St Helens PCT]</ref>

==Transport==
===Rail===
There are two railway stations.  [[Runcorn railway station|Runcorn (mainline) station]] is on the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line.  From this station [[Virgin Trains]] run 15 trains daily on weekdays between Liverpool and London and [[Central Trains]] run frequent services between Liverpool and Birmingham.  [[Runcorn East railway station|Runcorn East station]] is on the Chester to Manchester line.  [[Arriva Trains Wales]] and [[Northern Rail]] run an hourly service to Chester, Warrington and Manchester.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/publictransport/content/railinformation/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Rail information]</ref>

===Bus===
Runcorn is unusual in that in addition to using the normal roads, special [[Bus rapid transit#Implementation in Europe|busways]] are also available to be used by buses and no other form of transport other than emergency vehicles. There are two bus stations, one in the Old Town centre and the other at Halton Lea.  Two companies provide local public transport services, [[Halton Transport]] and [[Arriva]].  Express coach services calling at Runcorn are provided between Hoylake via Liverpool and London and between Southport and Cambridge by [[National Express]].<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/publictransport/content/businformation/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Bus information]</ref> 

In addition coach services are provided by Selwyns and Anthony's Travel.
