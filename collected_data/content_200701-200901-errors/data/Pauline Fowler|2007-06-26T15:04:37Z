'''Pauline Fowler''' (née '''Beale''') was a [[fictional character]] in the popular [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played continuously by actress [[Wendy Richard]]<ref name="gone">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5165860.stm|title=Wendy Richard to leave EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[10 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> from the show's first episode on [[19 February]] [[1985]] and remaining on-screen for almost twenty-two years. She is the second longest-running character in the show's history, surpassed only by [[Adam Woodyatt]]'s character, [[Ian Beale]]. 

Storylines in ''EastEnders'' are often major news events in the UK, and Pauline's troubles were frequently the subject of newspaper headlines, television documentaries, behind-the-scenes books and fictional tie-in novels. Crises in her life were often aired on major holidays such as [[Boxing Day]], [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Day]], when ''EastEnders''' audience share is typically higher.
 
Pauline was depicted as the matriarchal stalwart of the fictional London community of [[Albert Square]]. Quintessentially [[working-class]], the character worked as an assistant at [[Walford]]'s [[List of buildings in EastEnders#Launderette|launderette]] from the show's inception in 1985 until her on-screen death in 2006. Her storylines focused on drudgery, money worries and family troubles, which were all confronted with steely determination and stoicism; traits that consistently typified the character. She was most often portrayed as an opinionated, sombre, battle-axe—a family orientated woman who often alienated her kin due to overbearing interference.

Pauline's marriage to the downtrodden [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] was central to the character for the first eleven years of the programme, ending with his screen death in 1996. Throughout her time in the serial Pauline was frequently featured with another long-running character, fellow launderette colleague, [[Dot Branning]], and their scenes together were often used for comedic purposes. In the latter years of her time in ''EastEnders'', Pauline was rarely seen without her [[Cairn Terrier]] Betty, who became her inseparable sidekick. Her narrative also included many feuds, most notably with her daughter-in-law, [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]], and arch-enemy [[Den Watts]]; a family-friend who got her daughter [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] pregnant at just 16. 

The character's final appearance was a death scene, dying from what was later revealed to be a blow to the head, in the middle of the Albert Square gardens on Christmas Day, [[25 December]] [[2006]]. The episode was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news |title= Vicar of Dibley tops Christmas TV viewing|url= http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1915232006|publisher= ''[[The Scotsman]]''|date=[[26 December]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-12-27 }}</ref>

== Character creation ==
===Background===
Pauline Fowler was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming some of the characters after his cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline and their mother Lou; a family set-up recreated on-screen as the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[The Beale/Fowler family|the Beales and Fowlers]].<ref name="insidestory">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders—The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher= BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-20601-2|pages=pages 49–50}}</ref>

Pauline's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''.

:"[[Pete Beale|Pete]]'s twin sister. Forty, and a chip off the [[Lou Beale]] block. Plucky, and determined to battle through whatever the odds. A warm, practical, unsophisticated woman: you stand by your man, do your duty, fight for your kids and have a roast for [[Sunday dinner]] … She's also pregnant … She actually remembers her dad [Albert] saying ''"Two things we don't discuss in this house are religion and politics".'' She also remembers her dad smoked a pipe, and wishes her husband did too. She loved her dad very much … Maybe she didn't go into her marriage with quite the right spirit? She was due to be chief bridesmaid at her sister's wedding but she'd got [[influenza|the flu]] and was confined to bed. Arthur, someone she'd known from school, was given permission to visit the invalid upstairs. He found himself proposing to her. Years later he said ''"It was to cheer her up really."'' And Pauline found herself accepting too … She's very fond of her twin brother, Pete (and knows that he's mum's favourite). She's very conventional, and the salt of the earth. Jolly, rounded, someone you can get your arms round. She doesn't trust skinny people…"<ref name="insidestory1">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders—The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher= BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-20601-2|pages=pages 53–54}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Image:PAULINE333.jpg|right|thumb|160px|An early image of Pauline in the soap's second episode (1985).]]
From the beginning, Smith had considered the role would be ideal for  [[Wendy Richard]], even though their casting policy was not to use 'stars'.   Richard was already well known in the UK  for playing glamorous roles, such as  [[List of Are You Being Served? characters#Miss Shirley Brahms|Shirley Brahms]] in the successful sitcom ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' Smith initially feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. She was subsequently offered the role.<ref name="insidestory2">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders—The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher= BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-20601-2|pages=pages 129–130}}</ref>

Richard's casting was considered to be "a giant leap of faith" by Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately "landed on its feet",<ref name="insidestory2"/> because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in ''EastEnders''' history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.

==Character development and impact==
===Lineage and personality===
The character of Pauline was a [[wiktionary:cornerstone|cornerstone]] of ''EastEnders'' for the first 22 years of its existence; the [[linchpin]] of the Fowler/Beale family around which the soap was originally structured. At the beginning of the ''EastEnders'' serial in 1985,  Pauline was 41 years old, married with two grown children, but the fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as ''EastEnders: The Inside Story'', and also the second tie-in novel by [[Hugh Miller (writer)|Hugh Miller]], ''Swings and Roundabouts.'' The books firmly linked the character to the area in which the soap is set; born and raised at [[list of residences in EastEnders#45 Albert Square|number 45]] [[Albert Square]]—where she lived for her entire life—marrying Arthur Fowler in 1965 and raising her own children  in the same house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Miller |first= Hugh|authorlink= Hugh Miller (writer)|title=[[EastEnders books#Novels|EastEnders—Book Two: Swings and Roundabouts]] |year=1986|pages=page 69|publisher=Inner Circle Books|id=ISBN 1-85018-050-4}}</ref> 

She remained a family-oriented character throughout the course of the show. A "fiercely loyal, but overbearing mother";<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1817719,00.html|title=Pauline to leave EastEnders|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> sheltering and taking on the major responsibilities of her children and frequently stressing the importance of family.<ref name="kominski"/> The inherent affiliation between Pauline and her family has been discussed by one journalist: "As the first episodes aired and the storylines unfolded, Pauline was there to bolster the family unit, and it was clear that she would be an important part of Albert Square, as well as the Fowler home…she shows her inner strength and backbone from our first introduction to her. It is clear that her family is her life, and though her relationships with her children have never been as close and trouble free as she would have liked, it is also clear that she would move heaven and earth for each of them…The Fowler family were a real family, and Pauline was the one to try and hold things together."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wgazette.com/aut06-beingpauline.html|title=The Importance of Being Pauline|publisher=''Walford Gazette''|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

As the serial progressed, Pauline altered somewhat from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the show's early years, she became a sombre [[wiktionary:battle-ax|battle-axe]], hardened by a life of misery in [[Albert Square]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/eastenders/Eastenders+Pauline+Fowler+to+be+Killed+off+at+Christmas-20368.html|title=Eastenders Pauline Fowler to be Killed off at Christmas|publisher=Femalefirst.co.uk|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> In fact she was once described as "the [[Boadicea]] of battle-axes."<ref name="tee">{{cite news|url=http://icteesside.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/columnists/mondayinterview/tm_objectid=15205494&method=full&siteid=50080&headline=star-looks-back--name_page.html|title=Star looks back|publisher=''Evening Gazette''|date=[[18 February]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref>

The initial change in her demeanour can be traced back to the death of her mother, [[Lou Beale]]—a fierce dowager, who ruled over her family with a "rod of iron."<ref name="20years5">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0|pages=page 57}}</ref> Following Lou's screen funeral in episode 359 (July 1988), Pauline retorts: "Shut up Arthur Fowler, no one interrupts Pauline Beale when she's in full flow"; a line that was used by her mother in the episode that preceded her death. This recreation of a scene between Lou and Arthur [[symbolism|symbolised]] the transference of the family's [[matriarch]]al role from Lou to Pauline.<ref name="july1">{{cite episode |title=EastEnders |series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Written by [[Tony Holland]], directed by [[Julia Smith]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1988-07-28}}</ref><ref name="july2">{{cite episode |title=EastEnders |series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Written by [[Tony Holland]], directed by [[Julia Smith]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1988-07-26}}</ref>

Wendy Richard has indicated that both she and show creator, Julia Smith, had always intended for Pauline to become like her mother<ref name="anniversary"/><ref name="DSdisappointed"/> and former ''EastEnders'' executive producer, [[John Yorke]], has commented on the importance of the lineage between the two characters: "[Pauline] endures, stoically and heroically, whatever life may throw at her, just as her mother did before her. This sense of lineage is vitally important, too. Pauline has been in the show since its start and was handed the role of matriarch on Lou Beale's death."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,721140,00.html|title=Queen of all soaps|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[24 May]] [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> 

Pauline became progressively miserable and stern over the course of the show,<ref name="guardianculture"/> which led to her being nicknamed "Fowler the growler" by several other characters in the programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20051204/ai_n15905340|title=Ian Hyland: Nickname of the week|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[4 December]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> Pauline addressed this during an on-screen conversation with her best friend, Dot, in an episode that was broadcast on [[24 June]] [[2004]]. She attributed her sombre personality to the deaths of those around her, saying: "If you want to know why I am the way I am, look no further than that."<ref>{{cite episode |title=EastEnders |series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=2004-06-24}}</ref>

===Marriage to Arthur===
Pauline's marriage to the luckless [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] was central to her character and they have been hailed as "the soap's most famous husband and wife team."<ref name="feud">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960512/ai_n14451573|title=WENDY NEVER INVITED ME TO HER WEDDING|publisher=''[[Sunday Mirror]]''|date=[[12 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> The dynamics of Pauline and Arthur's relationship were clear from the beginning of the programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that held the Fowler family together, while Arthur was depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer [[Jacquetta May]], who once played [[Rachel Kominski]] in the programme, has commented that Pauline and Arthur "represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man… Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved like a little boy while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression."<ref name="kominski">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|title= Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> 
[[Image:Paul arth fryin.jpg|left|thumb|Pauline hits Arthur with a frying pan (1993).]] 
Pauline and Arthur were generally seen as the most stable couple in the show, so the storyline involving Arthur's [[adultery|affair]] with [[Christine Hewitt]] in 1992 came as a huge shock to viewers.<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2|pages=page 128}}</ref>  The British press labelled the storyline "The Bonk of the Year" and it finally reached its climax on-screen in September 1993.<ref name="first10years1">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2|pages=page 107-108}}</ref> The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would find out about the affair; should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?<ref name="first10years"/> In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he did,  Pauline became violent and hit him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, "an act of betrayal on a massive scale."<ref name="first10years"/> Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this "iconic" scene: "It was one of the few times when you saw Pauline really, really  let rip … you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did."<ref name="revealed"/> This episode (written by [[Tony McHale]] and directed by [[Keith Boak]]) was chosen by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the episode of the year in ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The First Ten Years]]''<ref name="first10years"/> and is described by Wendy Richard as "Pauline's crowning moment."<ref name="tee"/> 

For a while it seemed that ''EastEnders''' "most solid" marriage was over,<ref name="first10years"/> but Arthur spent the rest of 1993 trying to convince Pauline that it was worth saving and they eventually reconciled.<ref name="first10years2">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2|pages=page 118}}</ref> However, more tragedy was to follow when Arthur was framed by a conman, [[Willy Roper]] (dubbed "Wicked Willy" by the British press),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960505/ai_n14451770|title=WICKED WILLY AND HIS FRIEND CARRY ON UP THE NILE|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[5 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> and wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement in 1995. The storyline captured the public's imagination and a nationwide "Free Arthur Fowler" campaign was launched—"Arthur Fowler Is Innocent" T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the [[UK singles chart]] promoting the campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61275849.html|title=THE NET; My little Willy is on the Web|publisher=''Daily Record''|date=[[23 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

Arthur's imprisonment was a precursor to the final exit of actor [[Bill Treacher]], who decided to leave ''EastEnders'' after 11 years playing Arthur.<ref name="Dartagnan">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,5-2002290611,00.html|title=D'Arthur to D'Artagnan|publisher=''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''|accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref> While Arthur went to pieces in prison, Pauline was heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release. For several months viewers witnessed Willy attempt to woo Pauline, but she eventually uncovered his deception and then resorted to uncharacteristic [[seduction]] to gain his confession.<ref name="confess">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960512/ai_n14451377|title=Pauline's one jumper ahead|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[12 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> One critic commented "Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in ''EastEnders''. The way which she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole was nothing short of brilliant."<ref name="confess"/> Arthur was exonerated, but his joyful reunion with Pauline was brief, as an injury he sustained in prison led to a [[brain haemorrhage]] and he died shortly after his release. His death ended an 11 year screen marriage, the serial's most enduring to date.<ref name="feud"/>

===Other storylines===
The character of Pauline featured in many other storylines, including giving birth at the age of 41 to her youngest son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]], a storyline that Wendy Richard has classed as her character's happiest.<ref name="tee"/> Her narrative also included many feuds, most notably with lothario [[Den Watts]], a family-friend who got her daughter Michelle pregnant at the age of 16. ''EastEnders'' pulled in the biggest television audience of the 1980s when 30.15m watched the 1986 Christmas episode in which Pauline discovered that Den was the father of her granddaughter, [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20050501/ai_n14609480|title=The nation's favourite TV moment?publisher=''The Sunday Herald''|date=[[01 May]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Wendy Richard has commented on the hostilty between the characters "once Pauline realised that Dennis was Vicki's father, she was out to get him one way or another" and actor, [[Leslie Grantham]], who played Den added "from then on it was out and out war, which was great!"<ref name="revealed"/> 

Pauline also contended with a plethora of family and money problems, which included a battle for the custody of her younger son's child and her elder son [[Mark Fowler|Mark's]] fatal battle with [[HIV]], a storyline that Richard is particularly proud of.<ref name="tee"/> The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggled to come to terms with her son's condition. It was  also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when EastEnders tackled it in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ww2.aegis.org/news/bbc/2005/BB050401.html|title=How well does TV and film tackle disease?|publisher=''BBC News''|date=[[03 April]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> In fact, when the storyline initially aired, more people went for a [[HIV test]] in Britain than at any other time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2006/10/02/hjuniord02.xml&sSheet=/health/2006/10/06/ixhfeatures.html|title=Trust me, I'm a junior doctor: is the truth stronger in fiction?|publisher=''[[The Telegraph]]''|date=[[02 October]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> Wendy Richard commented: "The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and Aids are not exactly the same thing. The Minister Of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across."<ref name="tee"/>

The HIV storyline came to an end on-screen in 2003, when the actor [[Todd Carty]] was written out of the serial after 13 years playing Mark. In the serial, Mark discovered that his HIV medication was failing and he decided to leave Walford to spend the remainder of his life traveling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go."<ref name="tee"/> 
[[Image:Launderette EE.jpg|right|thumb|An early image of Pauline and her oldest friend Dot, working at the launderette in 1988.]]
Pauline was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, [[Dot Branning]]. The two characters shared one of the soap's most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together were often used to provide humour.<ref name="tee"/> Particular emphasis was placed on their differences, which led to numerous petty squabbles and once saw them "buried alive" underneath a collapsed fairground ride, in the midst of a cake-selling war (2004).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv_and_radio/story/0,,1246722,00.html|title=Fairground extraction|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[25 June]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> However, Pauline and Dot were most frequently shown [[gossip]]ing, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo have been described by television personality, [[Paul O'Grady]], as a "fabulous double-act" and he went on to say: "Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else."<ref name="revealed"/>

The year 2006 saw Pauline re-marrying after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to [[Joe Macer]] (played by [[Ray Brooks]]) was an attempt to give the character a "new lease of life"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2005570563,00.html|title=Bride 'n gloom|publisher=''The Sun''|date=[[13 December]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> and her wedding day was screened to coincide with ''EastEnders''' 21st anniversary.<ref name="anniversary">{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1710666,00.html|title=In the early days all I ever got were crying scenes|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[16 February]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled—successfully—for Pauline to keep her surname, Fowler.<ref name="anniversary"/> In July 2006 however, Wendy Richard announced that she would be leaving the show. She said she made the decision to leave when the producers of ''EastEnders'' revealed that Pauline was to re-marry. Richard thought it was "disloyal" of Pauline to her beloved first husband Arthur, commenting: "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong." <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006360264,00.html|title=Wendy: Why I quit Enders|publisher=''The Sun''|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

===Exit===
Viewers saw the slow build-up to Pauline's climactic exit throughout the latter part of 2006. The character's bitter decline involved depression,  pretending to have a [[brain tumour]] to scupper the revived relationship between her son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] and his ex-wife [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]], marital breakdown and finally [[ostracism]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2006490182,00.html|title=Pauline's Christmas crack-up|publisher=''The Sun''|date=[[24 October]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref>

The character was killed off in a shocking and dramatic storyline, which aired on Christmas Day 2006 and was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers. It was the second most highly watched programme of the day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=424848&in_page_id=1773|title=BBC1 posts its worst Christmas Day ratings ever|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=[[26 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> It involved Pauline collapsing and dying in the middle of Albert Square, leaving both characters and viewers in uncertainty about the cause of her demise. 

The Christmas Day episodes, written by [[Simon Ashdown]], drew on the show’s early history to mark the occasion of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasized by the use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for ''[[The Times]]'', Tim Teeman, commented that "Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl." In addition, her parting scene with the other ''EastEnders'' long-serving "grand dame" [[Dot Branning]] (played by [[June Brown]]) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: "The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot … Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved."<ref name="times"/> 
[[Image:Pauline dead.jpg|left|thumb|Pauline dies in Albert Square gardens, Christmas Day 2006.]]
Richard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego's departure and has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's "changing character" and "depressing final storyline". In an interview with the [[The Biography Channel|Biography Channel]] she explained: "I did say, promise me you won’t make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did … I wasn’t too happy with the way it was done.

As a final tribute to Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special television programme entitled ''[[EastEnders Revealed]]: Goodbye Pauline'', which provided an emotional look back at Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates, [[Todd Carty]] and [[James Alexandrou]] (Mark and Martin respectively) and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and ''EastEnders'' actors such as [[Anna Wing]] and [[Pam St. Clement]] (Lou and [[Pat Evans|Pat]]).<ref name="EErevealed">{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/display.var.1097748.0.eastenders_revealed_goodbye_pauline_bbc1.php|title=EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, BBC One|publisher=''This Is Lancashire''|date=[[2 January]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> During the programme — which aired on [[New Year's Day]], 2007 — Wendy Richard reflected upon how "proud" she was of her character, commenting: "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well.

==Storylines==
===Early years===
When ''EastEnders'' begins, Pauline is a working wife and mother with two teenage children, and another on the way. Her husband, Arthur, has been made [[redundancy (law)|redundant]] in 1984. He has no prospects for steady employment, so Pauline's unexpected pregnancy comes at a very bad time. Pauline's mother, Lou, tells her that she cannot afford another child and orders her to "[[abortion|get rid of it]]", but Pauline stands up to her mother for the first time in her life and refuses. Apart from [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]]'s birth in July 1985, the following few years are not happy ones for Pauline.<ref name="EEHandbook">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 978-0685529577|pages=page 76}}</ref> She has to contend with her delinquent son Mark, her daughter Michelle's teenage pregnancy to a mystery man, and the [[mental breakdown]] and imprisonment of Arthur, who is caught stealing the Walford residents' Christmas club money.

After witnessing [[Den Watts]] giving Michelle money, Pauline correctly guesses that he is the father of her granddaughter, [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]].<ref name="EEHandbook1">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 978-0685529577|pages=page 43}}</ref> This launches a feud between Pauline and Den that lasts for the remainder of Den's life.

Following Lou's death in 1988, Pauline promptly takes over as the family matriarch. She is thrilled when Den is imprisoned on [[remand]] later in the year. However her ire rises once again when she discovers that Den has been sending Michelle and Vicki Christmas presents from prison. She threatens to inform his daughter, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]], that he is Vicki's father unless he keeps away from her family.<ref name="xmas88">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19881222.shtml|title=Xmas 88—Den in prison|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref> She is finally rid of Den when he is shot and presumed dead in February 1989.

In July 1989 Pauline begins to go through some poor health. Fearing that she might need a serious [[gynaecology|gynaecological]] operation, Pauline refuses medical assistance and is forced to hand in her notice at the launderette due to chronic tiredness. However, in September, she is hit by [[Ricky Butcher]]'s car, causing her to be hospitalised with a cracked rib.<ref name="first10years4">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2|pages=page 74}}</ref> The accident proves to be a blessing in disguise as the examination brings news that she is suffering with [[fibroids]].

===Heartache===
Pauline is overjoyed when her son Mark returns home in 1990 after nearly five years away. However she begins to worry that something is wrong when she discovers mysterious helpline cards in his clothes and notices how irrational he gets whenever he bleeds. On [[Boxing Day]] 1991 Mark finally decides to tell his parents that he is [[HIV positive people|HIV positive]].<ref name="xmas91">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19911226.shtml|title=Grant and Sharon get hitched|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> Pauline is distraught, but after a difficult period she comes to accept Mark's condition.<ref name="20years">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0|pages=pages 58-59}}</ref>

In 1992, Arthur takes up a new occupation as a gardener, most notably for the lonely divorcée [[Christine Hewitt]]. In May, Pauline learns that her brother [[Kenny Beale]] has been in a car crash in [[New Zealand]], and she decides to visit him (in fact, Wendy Richard had to be written out of the series to allow her time to act in ''[[Grace and Favour]]'').<ref name="first10years1"/> While she is away, Christine grows extremely close to Arthur and she eventually makes a pass at him. Although he is tempted, he turns her down and she then disappears, sending him a letter explaining her feelings, which is discovered by Pauline on her return. Pauline goes to see Christine to discover the truth, and finds her to be a lonely figure who drinks too much. Pauline is persuaded to forgive Arthur, but he cannot keep away from Christine and on Christmas Eve 1992 they sleep together.<ref name="20years1">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0|pages=page 86}}</ref>
[[Image:Pauline Arthur EastEnders.jpg|left|thumb|Pauline collects Arthur from prison in 1996, days before his death.]]
Throughout 1993 Christine begins to make greater demands on Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair. Arthur begins to realise that he has made a mistake. In September, under duress, Arthur decides to inform Pauline about his infidelity and tries to tell her that he wants her and not Christine. Hurt, embarrassed and angry, Pauline responds by hitting Arthur around the head with a frying pan and then throws him out of their home.<ref name="20years"/> Arthur spends the rest of the year trying to make up with her, and they eventually reconcile when he helps her deal with the death of her brother Pete in December 1993. They slowly begin to rebuild their marriage, although the affair is never allowed to be forgotten.<ref name="first10years2"/>

In 1995 Arthur is elected secretary of the [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] committee. He starts raising money to create a new urban garden and by the end of the year he manages to raise [[pound sterling|£]]20,000.<ref name="20years2">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0|pages=page 98}}</ref>

Arthur's friend [[Willy Roper]] takes a keen interest in the financial dealings, and cons Arthur into signing the fund money into various different accounts, then leaves him to face the consequences when the money is declared missing. For a second time, Arthur is imprisoned. Upon this, Arthur suffers a mental breakdown and refuses contact with Pauline.<ref name="20years2"/> Willy then spends the beginning of 1996 trying to woo Pauline, despite the objections of her family.<ref name="20years3">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0|pages=page 105}}</ref> 

In April 1996, Willy asks Pauline to go to [[Jersey]] on holiday—his real motive is to put the stolen money in an off-shore account under a false name. While travelling, Pauline and Willy become very close, but this changes when she discovers his [[counterfeit]] credit cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walford.net/update/19960430.htm|title=''EastEnders'' TUE 30-APR-96 episode description|publisher=Walford.net|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Back in Walford, she eventually manages to make him confess to [[embezzlement]] and [[frameup|framing]] Arthur, and Willy is arrested and charged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walford.net/update/19960509.htm|title=''EastEnders'' THU 09-MAY-96 episode description|publisher=Walford.net|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Arthur is cleared, but the day before his release he is involved in a prison riot and receives a blow to the head. Only a few days after his release in May 1996, Arthur suffers a [[brain haemorrhage]] on the [[allotment]]s, and dies the next day in hospital.<ref name="20years"/> His funeral is delayed pending an inquest, but the jury returns a verdict of accidental death, much to the disgust of Pauline, who feels that the prison services neglected to seek proper medical help for Arthur.<ref name="20years3"/> A bench is placed in dedication to his memory in the Albert Square gardens.

===Family issues===
Following Arthur's death, Pauline engrosses herself in her family, seeing it as her duty to keep it together. She is a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs, and although she is the first to criticise, she fully defends her children, often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships. She is particularly hostile to the women who feature in her sons' lives, and comes to epitomise the archetypal mother-in-law. 

When Pauline discovers in 2001 that her son Martin is the father of [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]]'s baby, [[Rebecca Miller (EastEnders)|Chloe]], she is determined to raise her grandchild herself. Sonia is opposed to this and decides to put Chloe up for adoption instead. Pauline threatens to take Sonia to court for custody, but is forced to back down when Martin admits that he does not want to be a father.<ref name="20years4">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0|pages=page 173}}</ref>

Pauline's overbearing ways alienate Martin, and she cannot curtail his delinquency. She begins to rely on her HIV-positive son Mark more than ever, but when he discovers that his medication is failing, he can no longer cope with her dependence and refuses to let her witness his deterioration. She tries everything she can to protect him, often smothering him in the process, and finds it especially difficult when Mark makes the decision to spend his last months traveling the world, instead of with her.<ref name="14 Feb 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20030214.shtml#4|title=Episode guide—14 Feb 2003|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> His eventual death in 2004 makes her more protective of her last remaining son, Martin.

She continues to meddle in Martin's life and refuses to loosen her control over him, even when he decides to marry Sonia. Pauline's interference in their wedding plans causes the couple to [[elope]] and marry away from Walford.<ref name="Thu 10 Jun 2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20040610.shtml|title=Episode guide—Thu 10 Jun 2004|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> In order to keep Martin within her grasp, Pauline signs over half her house to the couple so they have to remain living with her. Sonia finds it difficult to cope with Pauline and many rows erupt with Martin in the middle. Things worsen when Pauline contacts [[Margaret Wilson (EastEnders)|Margaret Wilson]], the guardian of Chloe (now named Rebecca), and begins visiting her against Sonia's wishes. Sonia is furious and the warring women are [[wikt:at loggerheads|at loggerheads]] for a long while, with Pauline adamant that Sonia and Martin should take steps to regain custody of Rebecca.<ref name="Fri 29 Apr 2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20050429.shtml|title=Episode guide—Fri 29 Apr 2005|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Pauline is later incensed to discover that Sonia has embarked on a [[lesbian]] affair with [[Naomi Julien]] in 2005. After Martin is given custody of Rebecca, Pauline makes it her mission to exclude Sonia from Rebecca's life. However, Martin is unable to keep Sonia away from Rebecca indefinitely. As he begins to cede, Pauline concocts ever more elaborate ways to obstruct Sonia's involvement and their personal feud continues.<ref name="Mon 07 Aug 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20060807.shtml|title=Episode guide—Mon 07 Aug 2006|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

===Second marriage===
[[Image:Pauline&Joe.jpg|right|thumb|Pauline and Joe marry, [[17 February]] [[2006]].]]
Several eligible bachelors express their interest in Pauline over the years, including [[Derek Taylor (EastEnders)|Derek Taylor]], [[Danny Taurus]], [[Jeff Healy (EastEnders)|Jeff Healy]] (who proposes), [[Eddie Skinner]], and [[Terry Raymond]], who she goes on a blind date with.<ref name="22 May 2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20010522.shtml#3|title=Episode guide—22 May 2001|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> However, Pauline remains staunchly faithful to her late husband's memory and refuses to let the relationships progress beyond companionship. In 2001 it looks as if Pauline is finally willing to begin a new relationship with her childhood friend, [[Derek Harkinson]], however he stuns her by confessing that he is [[homosexuality|gay]].<ref name="18 Dec 2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20011218.shtml#4|title=Episode guide—18 Dec 2001|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>  

In August 2005 however, Pauline grows close to [[Joe Macer]], whom she meets at a [[salsa dance]] class. Although Joe is obviously drawn to Pauline, he is kept at bay by Pauline's unwillingness to betray Arthur's memory. Pauline eventually allows him to get closer and it is not long before he falls in love and proposes to her in a crowded [[Queen Vic]]. She declines but Joe asks her again in February 2006 after telling her that he will leave to live in [[Dubai]] unless she commits to their relationship; this time she accepts,<ref name="Mon 06 Feb 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20060206.shtml|title=Episode guide—Mon 06 Feb 2006|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> and despite her misgivings, they marry on [[17 February]] [[2006]].

===Deception, reclusiveness and death===
In November 2006, Pauline and her son Martin argue about Pauline's treatment of Sonia, and Pauline becomes depressed to learn that Martin and Sonia have reunited. When a fire starts at Pauline's house, Pauline does nothing to stop it and awaits her death, until Martin rescues her. Whilst in hospital, Pauline concocts a story about having a brain tumour, in order to regain Martin's attention and cause a split between him and Sonia. The community initially rallies around Pauline, until Joe uncovers the deception, and Pauline is then ostracized. Still unfazed, Pauline decides to exert her revenge on her son by cutting him out of her life. She informs him that she is taking back the family's fruit and veg stall, cutting off his only source of income.<ref name="Thu 21 Dec 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20061221.shtml|title=Episode guide—Thu 21 Dec 2006|ublisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

Joe tries to get through to Pauline, but she is hostile. She compares him unfavorably to Arthur and confesses that she had never really loved him. She ridicules their lacklustre sex life and tells him their marriage is over. Furious, Joe begins smashing up her living room and insulting her family. Pauline retaliates by smashing a plate over his head<ref name="Thu 21 Dec 2006"/> and then makes plans to leave Walford to live with Michelle in America.

[[Image:Sonia slaps pauline.jpg|left|thumb|Sonia hits Pauline, Christmas Day 2006.]]
On Christmas Day 2006, Sonia informs Pauline that she and Pauline's son Martin are remarrying. A heated argument ensues, which culminates in Pauline being slapped in the face by Sonia. Despite Sonia's apologies, Pauline is still adamant that she is leaving Walford. However, when she discovers a Christmas card from her granddaughter Rebecca, she begins to realise what she is giving up. Pauline goes to tell Martin she is staying, but as she walks, she staggers and frequently clutches her head in obvious pain. Suddenly, she collapses in the middle of Albert Square gardens near Arthur's bench and lays motionless in the snow. A short time later she is found, and Martin is horrified to discover that she is dead.

Pauline's funeral takes place on [[1 January]] [[2007]]; however the proceedings are halted due to Dot, who calls the police after Rebecca confesses to seeing Sonia hit Pauline.<ref name="Tue 02 Jan 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20070102.shtml|title=Episode guide—Tue 02 Jan 2007—Pauline's funeral|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> The police interrupt the funeral to take Pauline's body away for an autopsy, which confirms that she died of a [[brain haemorrhage]], caused by a blow to the head.<ref name="Mon 01 Jan 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20070101_n2.shtml|title=Episode guide—Mon 01 Jan 2007—Sonia feels cornered|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>  

Sonia is arrested for Pauline's murder, but it turns out that her death has been caused by her husband Joe. He breaks down and confesses to Dot that he had argued with Pauline on Christmas day and, in a fury, he had struck her across the head with a frying pan, causing the brain haemorrhage that claimed her life. Dot is appalled and as she tries to leave, Joe attempts to apprehend her. The resulting scuffle causes Joe to lose his footing and fall out of the Fowlers' first floor window, to his death. Sonia is cleared, and Pauline's body is [[cremation|cremated]] on [[29 January]] [[2007]]. In June 2007, Dot buries Pauline's ashes at Arthur's grave.<ref name="ashes">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a58859/sean-dumps-chelsea.html|title=Sean dumps Chelsea|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Popularity===
Pauline is the second-longest running character to feature in ''EastEnders'' and one of only two original characters to remain in the show for almost 22 years. Her baggy woolly cardigan and long-suffering nature have led to her being labelled as a soap institution,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1044603.stm|title=EastEnder Pauline's Palace date|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=[[28 November]] [[2000]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> a "soap legend" and a "television icon".<ref name="stage">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/07/a_raven_leaves_the_tower_walford_style.php|title=A raven leaves the tower—Walford style|publisher=''[[The Stage]]''|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> 

When actress Wendy Richard announced her departure from the show in 2006, BBC controller of continuing drama [[John Yorke]] commented "Richard occupies a huge place in people's hearts"<ref name="gone"/> and executive producer [[Kate Harwood]] said, "For many years Wendy simply was ''EastEnders'' for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the ''EastEnders''' spirit … We thank her for everything she has done for the show…"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/11/richard.shtml|title=Wendy Richard MBE to leave EastEnders|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

Although it has been suggested by some that Pauline's presence in ''EastEnders'' was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike.<ref name="soaplife">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5166062.stm|title=Wendy Richard's dramatic soap life|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=[[10 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> ''[[Inside Soap]]'' editor Steven Murphy has said that the fact Pauline has been such an enduring staple will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure. "It's huge in soap terms … She's a character people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever." Jonathan Hughes, editor of ''All About Soap'' magazine, has also said "She's an absolute legend … You can't imagine the show without her … People will miss her because she's been such an important part of ''EastEnders'' for so many years."<ref name="soaplife"/> 

In May 2007, Wendy Richard was awarded with a 'Lifetime Achievement' award at the [[British Soap Awards]], to honour her years of service to ''EastEnders''. The award was presented by [[Todd Carty]], who played her on-screen son Mark.

===Criticism===
Despite being popular with many, the character of Pauline has also garnered much criticism over the years. Persistent criticism has been given to the character's dowdy attire, particularly the misconceived perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan;<ref name="stage"/> a claim that Wendy Richard herself categorically disputes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wgazette.com/aut06-beingpauline.html|title=The Importance of Being Pauline|publisher=''Walford Gazette''|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> In addition Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour.

Lucy Mangan, the culture critic from ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, summed up the character: "Pauline Fowler, is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable … She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for ''EastEnders'', but because of the writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show."<ref name="guardianculture"/> This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35<sup>th</sup> most annoying person of 2006 in a [[BBC Three]] poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list.<ref name="BBC Three">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0931335/ The Most Annoying People of 2006] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC Three]] | city = London, England | airdate = 2006-12-27}}</ref>

In addition, Pauline's exit in December 2006 was described as a "mess" by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' newspaper. He branded her final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! … I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead."<ref name="mess">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20061231/ai_n17087968|title=XMAS EXIT WAS A PAULINE MESS|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[31 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
''EastEnders'' was the first television show to have a "dial-a-soap" facility. Run by [[British Telecom]] in 1985, the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update. The synopses were scripted to be no longer than one minute and twenty-eight seconds per episode. Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to be the voice at the other end of the line and narrated each episode.<ref name="insidestory3">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders—The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher= BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-20601-2|pages=page 173}}</ref>

The character of Pauline was mentioned in the successful BBC drama ''[[This Life]]'' in 1997. In one episode of the show two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watched an episode of ''EastEnders'' on television and mocked Pauline's hysterics and her well documented tendency to wear cardigans.<ref name="thislife">{{cite episode |title=This Life |series= This Life|serieslink=This Life |credits= Including [[Daniela Nardini]], [[Andrew Lincoln]], [[Ramon Tikaram]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]]|began=1997-03-17 |ended=1997-08-07|season= 2}}</ref>

The character has also been spoofed in the successful BBC comedy sketch show, ''[[The Real McCoy (TV series)|The Real McCoy]]'' (1991–1995). One of the show's regular sketches featured a spoof version of ''EastEnders'', with [[black (people)|black]] comedians taking over roles of well known ''EastEnders'' characters who frequented a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian [[Llewella Gideon]] played the role of Pauline and the sketches placed considerable emphasis on her high-pitched voice.<ref name="rub">{{cite episode |title=The Real McCoy |series= The Real McCoy|serieslink=The Real McCoy (TV series) |credits= Including [[Llewella Gideon]], [[Meera Syal]], [[Felix Dexter]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]]|airdate=1996-02-02|season= 6|number=5}}</ref>

A promotional picture of Pauline and Joe was used on the official ''[[Torchwood]]'' website, in a fictional magazine article about aliens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torchwood.org.uk/html/gadgets/magazine.shtml|title=MAGAZINE ARTICLE, 2007|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref>
