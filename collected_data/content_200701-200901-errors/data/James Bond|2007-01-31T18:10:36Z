'''James Bond 007''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[England|English]] [[espionage|agent]]<ref>[http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/literary/casino_royale.php3 In Fleming's first novel, ''Casino Royale'', he refers to Bond as an agent.]</ref>, created in [[1952]] by writer [[Ian Fleming]], featured in several [[novel]]s and [[Short story|short stories]]. After Fleming's death in 1964, subsequent James Bond novels were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (as [[Robert Markham]]), [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]], [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], [[Raymond Benson]], and [[Charlie Higson]]. Moreover, [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] novelised two screenplays, while other writers have authored unofficial versions of the secret agent character.

Initially famed through the novels, James Bond is best known from the [[Eon Productions]] [[film series]], twenty-one of which have been made as of 2007. In addition there are two independent productions and one Fleming-licenced [[United States|American]] television adaptation of the first novel. The Eon Productions films are generally described as the "official" films and, although its origin is unclear, this term is used throughout this article. [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. "Cubby" Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] co-produced the official films until [[1975]], when Broccoli remained the sole producer. Since 1995, Broccoli's daughter [[Barbara Broccoli|Barbara]] and stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]] have co-produced them.

From 1962 through 2007, six actors have portrayed James Bond in "official" films:
<!---Please do not add Barry Nelson or David Niven to this list as they were not in official Bond films-->
*Sir [[Sean Connery]] (1962–1967; 1971)<!---Never Say Never was not an official Bond film; please do NOT add 1983 (it's noted in the paragraph following). The 2005 "From Russia with Love" video game is not considered a movie, either.-->
*[[George Lazenby]] (1969)
*Sir [[Roger Moore]] (1973&ndash;1985)
*[[Timothy Dalton]] (1987&ndash;1989)
*[[Pierce Brosnan]] (1995&ndash;2002)
*[[Daniel Craig]] (2006&ndash;present)
<div>The James Bond film series has the most sequels in motion picture history, with twenty-one sequels.   

The "unofficial" (that is non-Eon) versions were subject to separate licensing from Fleming. In the first version, [[Barry Nelson]] straight-forwardly portrayed James Bond in an [[Americanization|Americanised]] 1954 television episode adaptation of ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. In the second unofficial version, [[David Niven]] was James Bond in the Columbia Pictures spy [[spoof]] ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', in 1967. Moreover, Sean Connery reprised James Bond in the non-Eon film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), an updating of his own, fourth series film, ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).

Broccoli's and Saltzman's [[Family business|family company]], [[Danjaq|Danjaq, LLC]] has held ownership of the James Bond film series (through Eon), and maintained co-ownership with [[United Artists]] Corporation since the mid-1970s, when Saltzman sold his share of Danjaq to United Artists. As of 2007, [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/United Artists]] co-distribute the franchise.

In addition to the novels and films, James Bond is a prominent character in many [[James Bond games|computer and video games]], [[James Bond comic strips|comic strips]] and [[James Bond comic books|comic books]], and has been subjected to many [[James Bond parodies|parodies]].

===Ian Fleming's creation and inspiration===
[[Image:Fleming007impression.jpg|thumb|Fleming's commissioned image of James Bond to aid the ''[[Daily Express]]'' comic strip artists.]]

{{main|James Bond (character)|Inspirations for James Bond}}
Commander James Bond, [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve|RNVR]] is an agent of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) (more commonly, [[MI6]]). He was created in February 1952, by British journalist [[Ian Fleming]] while on holiday at his [[Jamaica|Jamaican]] estate, Goldeneye. The hero, 'James Bond', was named after an [[United States|American]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|ornithologist]], a [[Caribbean]] bird expert and author of the definitive field guide book ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''; keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] Fleming had a copy of Bond's [[field guide]] at Goldeneye. Of the name, Fleming once said, "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Maltravers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure &ndash; an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department."<ref>{{cite book | last = Chancellor | first = Henry | year = 2005 | title = James Bond: The Man and His World | publisher = John Murray | id = ISBN 0-7195-6815-3}}</ref>

Nevertheless, news sources speculated about real [[espionage|spies]] or other [[covert operations|covert agents]] after whom James Bond might have been named. Although they are similar to Bond, Fleming confirmed none as the source figure, nor did [[Ian Fleming Publications]] nor any of Fleming's biographers, such as [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] or Andrew Lycett. 

It has also been suggested that the name 'James Bond' originated in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], when [[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]] Commander Ian Fleming was invited by Sir [[William Stephenson]] (codename 'Intrepid'), to participate in the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] subversive warfare training Syllabus at [[Camp X|STS-103]]. Fleming had a private residence in [[Avenue Road]],  [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], because the training camp barracks was full. On Avenue Road, there was the [[St. James-Bond Church (Toronto)]], its address was 1066 Avenue Road, and the military building address  was 1107 Avenue Road (Double ones 0 and 7, thus number 007). The building does not exist, but in its place is [[Marshall McLuhan]] Catholic [[High school|Secondary School]] — erected by Bondfield Construction in 2001. 

James Bond's parents are Andrew Bond, a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] and Monique Delacroix, from Canton de [[Vaud]], Switzerland. Their nationalities were established in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service''. Fleming emphasised Bond's Scottish heritage in admiration of Sean Connery's cinematic portrayal, whereas Bond's mother is named after a Swiss fiancée of Fleming's; a planned, but unwritten, novel would have portrayed Bond's mother as a Scot. Ian Fleming was a member of a prominent Scottish banking family. <ref>http://salon.com/books/feature/2006/11/25/fleming/</ref> In his fictional biography of secret agent 007, John Pearson gave Bond's birthdate as 11 November ([[Armistice Day]]) 1920; however, there is no evidence of it in Fleming's novels. Fleming was inspired by the playboy and real secret agent [[Tricycle (spy)|Dušan Popov]], a Serb [[double agent]] for the British and the Germans. 

After completing the manuscript for ''Casino Royale'', Fleming allowed his friend, the poet [[William Plomer]] (later his editor), to read it, who liked it and submitted it to [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother [[Peter Fleming|Peter]], an established [[Travel literature|travel writer]].{{fact}}

Most researchers agree that the James Bond is a romanticised version of Ian Fleming, himself a jet-setting [[womanizer|womaniser]]. Both  Fleming and Bond attended the same schools, preferred the same foods ([[scrambled eggs]], pork{{fact}}), maintained the same habits (drinking, smoking, wearing short-sleeve shirts), shared the same notions of the perfect woman (in terms of looks and style), and had similar naval career paths (both rising to the rank of naval [[Commander]]). They also shared similar height, hairstyle and [[Eye color|eye colour]].  Bond's suave and sophisticated persona is based on that of a young [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. In ''Casino Royale'', the anti-heroine [[Vesper Lynd]] remarks, "[Bond] reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless." 
Fleming did admit to being partly inspired by his service in the [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Naval Intelligence Division]] of the [[Admiralty]], most notably an incident depicted in ''Casino Royale'', when Fleming and [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence Director]] [[John Henry Godfrey|Admiral Godfrey]] went on a mission to [[Lisbon]] en route to the United States during [[World War II]]. At the [[Estoril Casino]] (which harbored spies of warring regimes due to [[Portugal]]'s neutrality), Fleming was 'cleaned out' by a "chief [[Germany|German]] agent" in a game of [[Baccarat#Baccarat Chemin de Fer|Chemin de Fer]]. Admiral Godfrey's account differs in that Fleming played Portuguese businessmen, whom Ian fantasised as German agents he defeated at cards. Moreover, references to 'Red Indians' in Casino Royale, (four times, twice in the final  page) are to his own [[30th Assault Unit|30 Assault Unit]].

==Novels==
{{main|James Bond (novels)}}
In February 1952, Ian Fleming began writing his first James Bond novel. At the time, Fleming was the Foreign Manager for Kemsley Newspapers, owned by the ''[[London Sunday Times]]''. Upon accepting the job, Fleming asked for two months yearly vacation in his contract; time spent writing in Jamaica. Between 1953 and his death in 1964, Fleming published twelve novels and one short-story collection (a second collection was published posthumously). Later, continuation novels were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (as [[Robert Markham]]), [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], and [[Raymond Benson]], the last published in 2002. In 2005 began the [[Young Bond]] novel series of the adventures of the teenage James Bond, it is written by [[Charlie Higson]].

===Bond actors===

[[Image:Bonds-6.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Top: Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore <br> Bottom:Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig]]
<!---- Moved from former Trivia Section ---->
While initially sceptical about Scottish Sean Connery as English James Bond (once dismissing him as an "overgrown stuntman"), Fleming so appreciated his portrayal that he added Scottish background to the novels mentioning Bond's father. Accounts vary as to Fleming's initial choice actor for the cinematic James Bond. Sources suggest he favoured Roger Moore, [[James Mason]], and [[Cary Grant]], among others.{{fact}} Irish-American actor [[Patrick McGoohan]] was  offered and rejected the James Bond role. 

Timothy Dalton originally was contracted for three films, with the third film slated for 1991, but legal ownership problems of the James Bond franchise delayed release until 1994. Presistent rumors state that Dalton's third film was going to be "The Property Of A Lady", but the story, treatment, and draft screenplays were called Goldeneye.<ref>http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_17_intro.php3</ref> Timothy Dalton was also considered a second choice to play Bond after Connery left the role and was asked to star as James Bond in "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", however Timothy turned the film down feeling he was too young for it and felt it would leave behind an imposing legacy.<ref>http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/bonds/dalton.php3</ref>

British actor [[Lewis Collins]], who played the charactor Bodie in the popular British TV series [[The Professionals]], was considered as a replacement for Roger Moore when Moore announced his intention to retire from the role in the 1980s. The role however, subsequently went to Timothy Dalton.

Pierce Brosnan is the only actor who did not star in a James Bond film titled after an Ian Fleming novel and is the second actor to have not been from the United Kingdom.

In the course of the official series, American actors have been engaged to play James Bond on two occasions -- and have been approached other times as well. [[Adam West]] turned down ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' when Connery quit. John Gavin was contracted, in 1970, to replace George Lazenby, but Connery was well-paid to re-appear in ''Diamonds Are Forever''. [[Burt Reynolds]] was invited, in the early 1970s, to replace Connery after ''Diamonds Are Forever'', but he turned it down. [[James Brolin]] was contracted in 1983, to replace Roger Moore, and prepared to shoot ''Octopussy'' when the producers paid Moore to remain. Other American actors (e.g. [[Robert Wagner]]) also turned down the role. To date, the only American to play James Bond is [[Barry Nelson]], in the "unofficial" American 1954 television adaptation of ''Casino Royale''.

<!---- Moved from former Trivia Section ---->

====Film traditions====

The Eon Productions film series has its cinematic traditions, which date from the first film in 1962. 

=====Gun barrel sequence=====
[[Image:Maurice Binder Gunbarrel.jpg|left|thumb|Timothy Dalton as James Bond in the gun barrel sequence.]]

Since ''Dr. No'' each film has begun with  the [[James Bond gun barrel sequence]], introducing secret agent 007. Filmed through a [[rifling|rifled]] [[gun barrel]] (a bullet's perspective), the view-to-a-kill is of James Bond walking right-to-left, then quickly turning left and shooting. The gun barrel reddens with his would-be assassin's spilling blood, and then lightens to a white circle. Casino Royale marked the first Bond film without the gun barrel sequence opening the film - it occurs right before the opening credits. There was a minor difference in the Die Another Day sequence, which included seeing the actual bullet fly towards the screen, which did not happen in previous incarnations.

=====Pre-title sequence=====
After this visual introduction, every film (excepting ''Dr. No'') begins with a [[cold open|pre-title sequence]] teaser (a.k.a. the "opening [[gambit]]"). Usually, it features 007 finishing a mission (before assuming the film's mission), and is not always related to his main mission's objective; some teasers do pertain to the story and plot (e.g., ''Live and Let Die'' and ''Moonraker''), while others do not (e.g., ''Goldfinger'' and ''For Your Eyes Only''). Since ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', in 1977, the opening gambits have featured grand action, which progressively became grandiose. ''The World Is Not Enough'' (1999) features the longest opening gambit, more than 15 minutes, whereas most last seven to ten minutes.

<!---- Moved from former Trivia Section ---->
Five of the twenty-one films have title themes and theme songs not featuring the film's title in the lyrics: (i) the medley beginning 'Dr. No' (1962); the eponymous, instrumental title themes (ii) 'From Russia With Love' (1963) and (iii) 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' (1969); the songs (iv) "All Time High" (Octopussy, 1983); and (v) "You Know My Name" (Casino Royale, 2006). 
<!---- Moved from former Trivia Section ---->

=====Opening credits=====
[[Image:Kleinman titlecredits.jpg|thumb|Title credits from ''GoldenEye'' depicting the collapsing [[Soviet Union]] and the end of the [[Cold War]]]]

After the teaser, begin the [[opening credits]]: an arty display of naked and semi-naked women dancing, jumping, and shooting weapons. This [[title sequence]] is both a [[trademark]] and a visual staple of the James Bond film series. [[Maurice Binder]] was the creator and best-known designer of the opening credits, from 1962 until 1989, for fourteen of the films. The opening title sequences of the series' second and third films were designed by [[Robert Brownjohn]] in Binder's absence; they feature credits and action footage projected on models (see below). With 'Thunderball', Binder returned. Since his death, in 1991, [[Daniel Kleinman]] has designed the credits, and added computer-generated (CG) images to them. During the credits, the film's title song is sung by a contemporary artist. 

The visual elements in the opening titles metaphorically reflect themes in the film. Notable examples are:

* ''From Russia with Love'': as the story occurs in [[Turkey]], the credits are projected on a dancing [[belly dancer]]'s body.
* ''Goldfinger'': action scenes from the previous and the current film projected on to a  gold-painted, voluptuous, nude model.
* ''Thunderball'': submarine images of [[scuba]] divers, naked women swimmers, and bubbles.
* ''You Only Live Twice'': as it occurs in [[Japan]], [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]] motifs, i.e. [[geisha]]s, [[parasols]], and volcanic [[lava]] flows.  
* ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'': [[Britannia]], the [[Union Jack]], and the Imperial Crown are the patriotic symbols of the film introducing a new James Bond (George Lazenby); scenes from earlier adventures, passing through an [[hourglass]], highlight serial continuity. 
* ''Diamonds are Forever'': features [[diamonds]].
* ''Live and Let Die'': voodoo images of flames and skulls.
*''Moonraker'': sky, clouds, and the Earth, women flying through space, and tumbling women in silhouetted airborne acrobatics.
* ''For Your Eyes Only'': like Thunderball, its opening credits are aquatic, though more subtle, with images of [[fish]] and water [[surface tension]]. [[Sheena Easton]] is featured singing the title song, (the only singer to appear in the title sequence).   
* ''Octopussy'': James Bond is embraced the many arms of a woman similar to [[Kali]]; ''Octopussy'' occurs in [[India]]. 
* ''GoldenEye'': features toppling and toppled [[Communist]] statues and symbols, demolished by naked and semi-naked women swinging sledgehammers. The teaser occurs in the [[Soviet Union]]; the current mission is in post-Soviet [[Russia]]; a [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] woman appears; the villain's organisation is the Janus Syndicate. 
* ''Tomorrow Never Dies'': stylistic representations of [[electronic media]]: [[pixels]], [[hexadecimal]] script, [[integrated circuit|integrated circuitry]].
* ''The World is Not Enough'': [[iridescence|iridescent]] [[oil]], control of which is the film's plot.
* ''Die Another Day'': unusual, the images advance the story: James Bond's [[torture]] in [[North Korea]]; much fire and ice referring to some of the torture methods themselves; also a reference to the arctic setting and the villain's superweapon.
* ''Casino Royale (2006)'': Rouennais [[playing card]] motifs, with duochrome silhouettes of men in gun-, knife-, and fist fights. Unlike the previous films, since ''Doctor No'', the gunbarrel sequence starts the title credits, not the film. 

The James Bond adventure films are unusual in retaining traditional full opening and full closing credits; since the late 1990s it is common for [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films to only show detailed end credits, with only the title displayed at film's start.

====="Bond, James Bond"=====
Agent 007's famous introduction, "Bond, James Bond", became a [[catchphrase]] after it was first uttered (cigarette in a corner of his mouth) by [[Sean Connery]] in ''Dr. No''. Since then, the phrase has entered the [[lexicon]] of Western [[popular culture]] as the epitome of polished, understated machismo. On [[June 21]], [[2005]] it was honoured as the 22nd historically-greatest cinema quotation, by the [[American Film Institute]] in their [[100 Years Series]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/quotes.aspx | title = "Bond. James Bond" 22nd greatest line in cinema history | work = AFI's 100 Years… 100 Movie Quotes | accessdate = July 13 | accessyear = 2005}}</ref> In promoting the release of ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', post-modern preview trailers featured James Bond Pierce Brosnan saying, "Bond. You know the rest." 'GoldenEye', in 1995, similarly drew on the post-modern public's familiarity with James Bond; its promotional teaser poster reads: "You know the name. You know the number." The theme song of "Casino Royale" is "You Know My Name", although this possibly could refer to [[M]] rather than Bond; CIA agent Felix Leiter is the first man to whom James Bond so identifies himself in the novels.

=====Drinks=====
James Bond displays a connoisseur's knowledge (occasionally even showing up M) of various drinks including Champagnes, ports and brandies, understanding both their manufacture and the correct way to serve and enjoy them.  He is most well known for his preference for the "[[Martini (cocktail)|vodka martini]], [[Shaken, not stirred]]", which he first ordered at the end of chapter 14 of "Dr. No". The cocktail's style of preparation is first recited on screen by Bond's room service waiter in Jamaica in ''Dr. No''; later, Dr. No himself recites it in persuading Bond to accept the proffered drink; this catchphrase is honoured by the AFI as the 90th most-memorable cinema quotation. 

Strangely, whilst the phrase is associated with every James Bond, Roger Moore never uttered it in a film, and only drank a martini when a female Soviet agent ordered it for him in Egypt. In ''You Only Live Twice'' the cocktail's style of preparation is reversed, and a polite Bond accepts a 'stirred, not shaken' martini from a colleague; in ''Licence to Kill'' Bond accepts a 'stirred, not shaken' martini from his American girl ally. In ''Casino Royale'' the in-joke is James Bond's "Do I look like I give a damn?" reply to a bartender's query of "shaken or stirred?" 

The film (and the book) ''Casino Royale'' feature a cocktail recipe of Bond's own creation, named "Vesper" in honour of [[Vesper Lynd]], his female companion during much of the story. A Vesper is three measures of Gordon's [[gin]], one (1) measure of [[vodka]], and a half-measure of Kina [[Lillet]].

====="James Bond will return.."=====
Every film, except ''Dr. No'' (1962) and ''Thunderball'' (1965) has the line: "James Bond will return..." or "James Bond will be back" during or after the final credits. Up until ''Octopussy'' (1983), the end-credit line would also name the next title to be produced ("James Bond will return in..."). Over the years, the sequel has been incorrectly named three times. The first, 1964's ''Goldfinger'', announced in early prints that Bond would return in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service''. However, the producers changed their minds shortly after release and subsequently corrected future editions of the film. In 1977, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' stated that 007 would be back in ''For Your Eyes Only'', but Eon Productions decided to instead take advantage of the ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' craze and release ''Moonraker'', whose plot was changed to involve [[outer space]] (unlike ''Goldfinger'', however, Eon chose not to correct the credits of ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', so the error remains). Thirdly, ''Octopussy'' incorrectly states the next film as being ''From a View to a Kill'', the original literary title of ''A View to a Kill''.  In the most recent Bond films, the title of the next film has been omitted, saying simply 'James Bond will return'. The liner-notes of a 'Best of Bond' music [[Compilation album|compilation CD]] stated that this was because the early films all used titles from Fleming's novels; having outpaced the novels with the current Bond films, the abbreviated form is used instead.

American actor [[James Brolin]] was once a leading contender to play Bond in the 1983 film Octopussy until Roger Moore finally agreed to return. Brolin's three screentests were publicly released for the first time as a special feature named ''James Brolin: The Man Who Would Be Bond'' in the ''[http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62255 Octopussy Ultimate Edition DVD]''.

Every actor who auditions for the Bond role must always perform a scene from ''From Russia With Love'', where he hears a noise and investigates, only to discover a beautiful stranger on his bed.<ref>{{cite news| last = Wise| first = Damon| coauthors = Martin Campell, Daniel Craig| title = No More Mr Nice Spy| pages = 76| publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]| date = 2006-10-27}}</ref>

There is also lively debate on the best Bond movie, with most major [[Film criticism|film critics]] giving the top mark to either ''From Russia with Love'' (Connery's favourite, as he re-asserted in a 2002 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] interview with [[Sam Donaldson]]) or its brassy follow-up, ''Goldfinger''. Many also credit other Connery films as their favourites, including the original ''Dr. No'' and ''Thunderball'', while others prefer Brosnan's take on Bond with ''GoldenEye''. Despite George Lazenby's short tenure in the tuxedo, some reviewers have also warmed to ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' &ndash; [[Leonard Maltin]]'s ''TV Movies'' (a.k.a. ''Leonard Maltin’s Movie & Video Guide'') review book states it might have been the best Bond film ever had Connery appeared in it; Raymond Benson concurs in ''The James Bond Bedside Companion''. ''Casino Royale'', the latest Bond, is at present the highest-rated on the [[IMDb]], with 7.9 out of 10.

===Non-Eon Films, Radio and Television Programmes===
In 1954, [[CBS]] paid Ian Fleming $1,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] for the rights to adapt ''Casino Royale'' into a one hour [[television]] adventure as part of their ''[[Climax! (television)|Climax!]]'' series. The episode featured [[United States|American]] [[Barry Nelson]] in the role of "Jimmy Bond", an agent for the fictional "Combined Intelligence" agency. The rights to ''Casino Royale'' were subsequently sold to producer [[Charles K. Feldman]] who turned Fleming's first novel into a [[Parody|spoof]] in 1967 featuring [[David Niven]] as Sir James Bond and five other actors (such as [[Peter Sellers]]) as faked "James Bond"s. The instrumental [[theme music]] was a hit for [[Herb Alpert|Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]]. For more information, see [[Casino Royale (novel)#Adaptation history|the history of ''Casino Royale'']].

[[Bob Holness]] portrayed James Bond in a South African radio adaptation of ''Moonraker'' in 1956, which is the only radio Bond programme known today. 

Before his first appearance in the Eon Bond film ''Live and Let Die'' in 1973, Roger Moore played the role in an episode of a TV comedy show called ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/m/mainlymillicent_7774225.shtml Mainly Millicent]'' (starring [[Millicent Martin]] and guest stars) in summer 1964. This episode is included as a special feature (named ''Roger Moore as James Bond, Circa 1964'') in the newly published ''[http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62164 Live and Let Die Ultimate Edition DVD]''.

When plans for a James Bond film were scrapped in the late 1950s, a story treatment entitled ''Thunderball'', written by Ian Fleming, [[Kevin McClory]] and [[Jack Whittingham]], was adapted as Fleming's ninth Bond novel. Initially the book was only credited to Fleming. McClory filed a lawsuit that would eventually award him the film rights to the title in 1963. Afterwards, he made a deal with [[Eon Productions]] to produce a [[film adaptation]] starring Sean Connery in [[1965]]. The deal stipulated that McClory could not produce another adaptation until a set period of time had elapsed, and he did so in 1983 with ''Never Say Never Again'', which featured Sean Connery for a seventh time as 007. Since it was not made by Broccoli's production company, Eon Productions, it is not considered a part of the "official" film series. A second attempt by McClory to remake ''Thunderball'' in the 1990s with [[Sony Pictures]] was halted by [[Law|legal action]] resulting in the studio abandoning its aspirations for a rival James Bond series. Until his death in [[November]] [[2006]] McClory claimed to still own the film rights to ''Thunderball'', though [[MGM]] and Eon assert they have expired. For more in-depth information, see [[Thunderball (novel)#The controversy over the novel|the controversy over ''Thunderball'']].

The 1973 [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Omnibus (TV series)|Omnibus]]: The British Hero'' featured [[Christopher Cazenove]] playing a number of such title characters (e.g. [[Richard Hannay]] and [[Bulldog Drummond]]), including James Bond in dramatised scenes from ''[[Goldfinger]]'' - notably featuring the hero being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam - and ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''.

===Dealing with the changing actor===
{{main|James Bond (character)#Alternative biographies and theories}}
The Bond films rarely explicitly acknowledge the changes in cast members which have affected several of the recurring characters including [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Blofeld]], [[Felix Leiter]], [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Miss Moneypenny]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. However, there are a few instances of reference to this, including:
* In the early scenes of the 1967 ''Casino Royale'', David Niven's retired Bond berates M for giving his number and his name to a brash new agent; the description he gives fits Sean Connery's Bond.
* In ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', when Tracy leaves George Lazenby's Bond alone on the beach, he complains, "This never happened to the other fellow."  Similarly, a reference to Bond's return from holiday is included in the following film "Diamonds Are Forever", which featured Sean Connery's return to the role.
* In ''GoldenEye'', [[Valentin Zukovsky]] comments on how "the new M" is a woman.  
* In ''The World Is Not Enough'' (1999) [[Major Boothroyd]]'s Q (played by [[Desmond Llewelyn]]) is preparing to retire, introducing his assistant, (jokingly referred to by Bond as "R"), played by [[John Cleese]]. Boothroyd has clearly retired by the time of ''Die Another Day'' (2002), although Cleese's character was first referred to as Quartermaster, then as Q.

===James Bond's influence on movies and television===
{{main|James Bond parodies}}
James Bond has long been a household name and remains a huge influence within the spy genre. The ''[[Austin Powers]]'' series by writer and actor [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] and other parodies such as ''[[Johnny English]]'' (2003), ''[[OK Connery]]'', the "[[Our Man Flint|Flint]]" series starring [[James Coburn]] as Derek Flint, the "[[Matt Helm]]" movies starring [[Dean Martin]], and ''Casino Royale'' (1967) are testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture.

1960s TV imitations of James Bond such as ''[[I Spy]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', and ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' went on to become popular successes in their own right, the latter having enjoyed contributions by Fleming towards its creation: the show's lead character, "[[Napoleon Solo]]", was named after a character in Fleming's novel ''Goldfinger''; Fleming also suggested the character name April Dancer, which was later used in the spin-off series ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' A reunion [[television movie]], ''[[The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1983), is notable for featuring a cameo by George Lazenby as James Bond in tribute to Fleming (for legal reasons, the character was credited as "JB").

The animated series US Acres (which aired with the Garfield cartoons) featured a "secret agent" episode with many Bond references. For instance, the one-letter names used to apply to the high-ranking MI6 individuals were parodied.

In ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', some time after the departure of the character ''[[Cathy Gale]]'' (played by actress [[Honor Blackman]]), the character of ''[[John Steed]]'' (played by [[Patrick Macnee]]) receives a Christmas card from her. He comments, "It's from Mrs Gale! I wonder what she's doing in Fort Knox?" &ndash; the intended destination for Honor Blackman's ''[[Pussy Galore (James Bond)|Pussy Galore]]'' in ''Goldfinger''. In further coincidence, this comment is made to ''[[Emma Peel]]'' &ndash; played by [[Diana Rigg]] who would later appear as ''[[Tracy Bond]]'' in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service''. Macnee himself, a friend of Roger Moore, would later appear as ''Sir Godfrey Tibbett'' in ''A View to a Kill''. Joanna Lumley (Purdey in the late Avengers serie) can also be seen in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' in a little role with only one or two words.

A story line in ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' has Jethro ([[Max Baer, Jr.]]) forsaking his lifelong ambition to become a [[Neurosurgery|brain surgeon]] in favour of "double-naught spy". He outfits the Clampetts' truck with various Q-inspired gadgetry, none of which work according to plan.

In an apparent homage to the 'James Bond will return in...' credits, each of the season-ending episodes to date in the new (2005-present) series of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' has featured the ending credit, 'Doctor Who will return in...' followed by the title of the next episode (in each case, a [[Christmas special]]).{{Cite needed}}

Similarly, four episodes of the TV series ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' ([[For British Eyes Only]], [[Forget-Me-Now]], [[Notapusy]] and [[Mr. F]]) referenced the James Bond films. The spoofing of the Bond films is evident in the episode titles, vocal and instrumental music cues, and the gun barrel shot at the end of the episode accompanied by the subtitle "Michael Bluth will return in..."

[[George Lucas]] has said on various occasions that Sean Connery's portrayal of Bond was one of the primary inspirations for the [[Indiana Jones]] character, a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana's father in the third film of that series.

In the episode "[[A Head in the Polls]]" of the animated television show [[Futurama]], the robot Bender asks for a martini from a bartender, who pours the ingredients directly into a hole in the top of Bender's head.  Bender then says, "Shaken, not stirred."

More of an imitation or homage (or possibly an unintentional parody),  at the start of the French film "Taxi 3", after a Bond-style opening stunt sequence that end when a spy (played by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) is taken away by helicopter, a Bond-style theme music / opening credits sequence is performed before the main story proceeds.

On the popular Internet series, ''[[Red vs Blue]]'', the character Donut is sent on a spy mission in the season 2 episode "Nut. Doonut.", and for around a quarter of the episode he makes references to James Bond and parodies some of the movie titles. The episode also has alternative titles based on Bond film titles.

==Music==
{{Main|James Bond music}}

"[[The James Bond Theme]]" was written by [[Monty Norman]] and was first orchestrated by the [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] Orchestra for 1962's ''Dr. No'', although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. However, in 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from the British paper ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1229406.stm | title = Monty Norman sues for libel | work = Bond theme writer wins damages | accessdate = March 9 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Barry did go on to compose the [[Film score|scores]] for eleven Bond films in addition to his uncredited contribution to ''Dr. No'', and is credited with the creation of "[[The 007 Theme|007]]", used as an alternate Bond theme in several films, as well as the popular orchestrated theme "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". Both "The James Bond Theme" and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" have been [[remix]]ed a number of times by popular artists, including [[Art of Noise]], [[Moby]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], and the [[Propellerheads]]. The British/Australian [[string quartet]] also named [[Bond (band)|bond]] (purposely in lower case) recorded their own version of the theme, entitled "Bond on Bond". 

Barry's legacy was followed by [[David Arnold]], in addition to other well-known composers and [[record producer]]s such as [[George Martin]], [[Bill Conti]], [[Michael Kamen]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and [[Eric Serra]]. Arnold is the series' current composer of choice, and recently completed the score for his fourth consecutive Bond film, ''Casino Royale''.

The Bond films are known for their theme songs heard during the title credits sung by well-known popular singers (which have included [[Tina Turner]], [[Wings (band)|Paul McCartney and Wings]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], among many others). [[Shirley Bassey]] performed three themes in total. ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' is the only Bond film with a solely instrumental theme, though [[Louis Armstrong]]'s ballad "[[We Have All the Time in the World]]", which serves as Bond and his wife Tracy's [[love song]] and whose title is Bond's last line in the film, is considered the unofficial theme. The main theme for ''Dr. No'' is the "James Bond Theme", although the opening credits also include an untitled [[bongo]] interlude, and concludes with a vocal [[Calypso music|Calypso]]-flavoured rendition of "[[Three Blind Mice]]" entitled "Kingston Calypso" that sets the scene. ''From Russia with Love'' also opens with an instrumental version over the title credits (which then segues into the "James Bond Theme"), but Matt Monro's vocal version also appears twice in the film, including the [[closing credits]]; the Monro version is generally considered the film's main theme, even though it doesn't appear during the opening credits.  The only singer, to date, to appear within the titles is [[Sheena Easton]], who sang the theme for ''For Your Eyes Only''.  The only singer of a title song to appear within the film itself as a character, to date, is [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who appeared (uncredited) as a fencing instructor, Verity, as well as contributing the theme for ''Die Another Day''. [[Chris Cornell]] performs "You Know My Name" in ''Casino Royale''. He is the first male [[Singer|lead vocalist]] to perform a 007 song since [[a-ha]] in 1987 for "The Living Daylights". This is also the first Bond theme song since 1983's Octopussy to use a different title than the film.  Although many of the theme songs were successful hits, the only theme song to hit #1 in the U.S. was Duran Duran's "A View to a Kill" which hit the top of the Billboard HOT 100 chart in 1985.

In [[1998]], Barry's music from ''You Only Live Twice'' was adapted into the hit song ''[[Millennium (song)|Millennium]]'' by producer and composer [[Guy Chambers]] for British recording artist [[Robbie Williams]]. The music video features Williams parodying James Bond, and references other Bond films such as ''Thunderball'' and ''From Russia With Love''. It should also be noted that the video was filmed at Pinewood Studios, where most of the Bond films have been made.

==Video games==
{{Main|James Bond games}}

[[Image:Everything or Nothing.jpg|thumb|''[[Everything or Nothing]]''
Pierce Brosnan as James Bond]]
In 1983, the first Bond video game, developed and published by [[Parker Brothers]], was released for the [[Atari 2600]], the [[Atari 5200]], the [[Atari 800]], the [[Commodore 64]], and the [[Colecovision]]. Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines.

Bond video games, however, didn't reach their popular stride until 1997's ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'' by [[Rare (video game company)|Rare]] for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Subsequently, virtually every Bond video game has attempted to copy ''GoldenEye 007''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s accomplishment and features to varying degrees of success &ndash; even going so far as to have a game entitled ''[[GoldenEye: Rogue Agent]]'' that had little to do with either the video game ''GoldenEye'' or the film of the same name. Bond himself plays only a minor role in which he is "killed" in the beginning during a '[[virtual reality]]' mission, which served as a tutorial for the game.

Since acquiring the licence in 1999, [[Electronic Arts]] has released 8 games, 5 of which have original stories (i.e., not based on a film) including the popular ''[[Everything or Nothing]]'', which broke away from the [[first-person shooter]] trend that started with ''GoldenEye 007'' and went to a [[third-person shooter|third-person]] perspective. It also featured well known actors including [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Heidi Klum]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond, although several previous games have used Brosnan's likeness as Bond. In 2005, Electronic Arts released another game in the same vein as ''Everything or Nothing'', this time a video game adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'', which allowed the player to play as Bond with the likeness of [[Sean Connery]]. This was the second game based on a Connery Bond film (the first was a 1980s [[text adventure]] adaptation of ''Goldfinger'') and the first to use the actor's likeness as agent 007. Connery himself recorded new voiceovers for the game, the first time the actor played Bond in 22 years.

In 2006 [[Activision]] secured the licence to make Bond-related games, currently shared with EA. The deal will become exclusive in September 2007.

==Comic strips and comic books==
{{main|James Bond comic strips|James Bond comic books}}

In 1957 the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a newspaper owned by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. After initial reluctance by Fleming who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed and the first strip ''[[Casino Royale#Comic strip adaptation|Casino Royale]]'' was published in 1958. Since then many illustrated adventures of James Bond have been published, including every Ian Fleming novel as well as [[Kingsley Amis|Kingsley Amis's]] ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', and most of Fleming's short stories. Later, the comic strip produced original stories, continuing until 1983.

[[Titan Books]] is presently reprinting these comic strips in an [[ongoing series]] of [[graphic novel]]-style collections; by the end of 2005 it had completed reprinting all Fleming-based adaptations as well as ''Colonel Sun'' and had moved on to reprinting original stories.

Several [[comic book]] adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years, as well as numerous original stories.

==Bond characters==
{{main|List of James Bond allies|List of James Bond villains|Bond girl}}

The James Bond series of novels and films have a plethora of interesting allies and villains. Bond's superiors and other officers of the British Secret Service are generally known by letters, such as [[M (James Bond)|M]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. In the novels (but not in the films), Bond has had two secretaries, [[List of James Bond allies#Ponsonby, Loelia|Loelia Ponsonby]] and [[List of James Bond allies#Goodnight, Mary|Mary Goodnight]], who in the films typically have their roles and lines transferred to M's secretary, [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Occasionally Bond is assigned to work a case with his [[Friendship|good friend]], [[Felix Leiter]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. In the films, Leiter appeared regularly during the Connery era, only once during Moore's tenure, and in both Dalton films; however, he was only played by the same actor twice. Absent from the Brosnan era of films, Felix returned in Craig's first James Bond film ''Casino Royale'' in 2006.

Bond's women, particularly in the films, often have [[double entendre]] names, leading to coy jokes, for example, "[[Pussy Galore (James Bond)|Pussy Galore]]" in ''Goldfinger'' (a name invented by Fleming), "[[Plenty O'Toole]]" in ''Diamonds Are Forever'', and "[[Xenia Onatopp]]" (a [[villainess]] sexually excited by [[strangling]] men with her thighs) in ''GoldenEye''. 

Throughout both the novels and the films there have only been a handful of [[recurring character]]s. Some of the more memorable ones include [[List of James Bond allies#Tanner, Bill|Bill Tanner]], [[List of James Bond allies#Mathis, Rene|Rene Mathis]], [[Felix Leiter]], [[List of James Bond allies#Wade, Jack|Jack Wade]], [[Jaws (James Bond)#|Jaws]] and recently [[List of James Bond allies# Robinson, Charles|Charles Robinson]].

==Vehicles and gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets|List of James Bond firearms}}

[[Image:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Aston Martin DB5]] is probably the most famous and recognised Bond car]]
Exotic espionage equipment and vehicles are very popular elements of James Bond's literary and cinematic missions; these items often prove critically important to Bond removing obstacles to the success of his missions.

Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as ''From Russia with Love's'' booby-trapped [[attaché case]]; in ''Dr. No'', Bond's sole gadgets were a [[Geiger counter]] and a wristwatch with a luminous (and [[radioactive]]) face. The gadgets, however, assumed a higher, spectacular profile in the 1964 film ''Goldfinger''. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to 007. In the opinion of many critics and fans, some Bond films have included too many outlandish gadgets and vehicles, such as 1979's [[science fiction]]–oriented ''Moonraker'' and 2002's ''Die Another Day'', in which Bond's [[Aston Martin]] could actually become [[Cloaking device|invisible]] thanks to a technology Q refers to as [[active camouflage|adaptive camouflage]]. Since ''Moonraker'', subsequent productions struggled with balancing gadget content against the story without depicting a technology-dependent man, to mixed results.

Bond's most famous car is the silver grey [[Aston Martin DB5]] seen in ''Goldfinger'', ''Thunderball'', ''GoldenEye'', ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' and ''Casino Royale''. The films have used a number of different Aston Martin DB5s for filming and publicity; one of them was sold in January 2006 at an auction in [[Arizona]] for $2,090,000 (USD) to an unnamed European collector. That specific car was originally sold for £5,000 in 1970.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4633986.stm | title = Aston Martin DB5 auction | work = James Bond car sold for over £1m | accessdate = February 8 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

In Fleming's books, Bond had a penchant for "battleship grey" [[Bentley]]s, while Gardner awarded the agent a modified [[Saab 900]] Turbo nicknamed the [[Licence Renewed#The Silver Beast|Silver Beast]] and later a [[Bentley Mulsanne]] Turbo.

In the James Bond films, Bond has been associated with several well-known watches  usually outfitted with high-tech features not found on the production models.  Perhaps the most famous of these is the Rolex Submariner, which appeared during the Sean Connery films.  Roger Moore's James Bond was fond of Seiko quartz watches. Pierce Brosnan's and Daniel Craig's James Bonds were both devotees of Omegas.  The selection of James Bond's watch has been a matter of both style and finance, as product placement agreements with the watch manufacturers have frequently been arranged.

Bond's weapon of choice in the beginning of ''Dr. No'' is a [[Beretta]] in 6.35mm Browning caliber, also called "Lilliput", later replaced by the German made [[Walther PPK]] in 7.65mm Browning. The PPK was used in every subsequent film and became his [[signature weapon]] until the ending of ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', when Bond required extra [[fire power]] and upgraded to the [[Walther P99]].  He used the pistol in ''The World Is Not Enough'' and ''Die Another Day'', and continued using it in ''Casino Royale''.

*On their second album "More Specials", released in 1980, The Specials closed side 1 with the track "Sock It To 'Em, J.B." Taking the song title at face value, the obvious musical JB inspiration is James Brown. However as the lyric name checks all the pre-1980 movies, inspiration for the track lies elsewhere.
*Kanye West and Jay-Z collaborate on [[Diamonds From Sierra Leone]], a song about the atrocities in Sierra Leone, but samples the theme from [[Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)|Diamonds Are Forever]].
