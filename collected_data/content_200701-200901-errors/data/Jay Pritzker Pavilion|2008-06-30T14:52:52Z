'''Jay Pritzker Pavilion''', '''Pritzker Pavilion''', or '''Pritzker Music Pavilion''' is a [[band shell]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The pavilion was designed by [[Frank Gehry]], named for [[Pritzker family]] member [[Jay Pritzker]], and was constructed between June 1999 and July 2004 in [[Millennium Park]].<ref name=MPF&F/> It is located on the south side of [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] directly across from some of the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|tallest buildings in the world]] and east of the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]].

It is the park's outdoor performing arts venue and the new home of the [[Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus]]. As home of the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus it is also the home of the [[Grant Park Music Festival]], the nation's only remaining free outdoor [[classical music]] series.

The performance venue is designed with a large fixed seating area, a great lawn, a [[trellis]] network to support the [[sound system]] and a signature Gehry [[stainless steel]] [[headdress]]. It features a sound system with an innovative acoustic design that replicates an indoor [[concert hall]] sound experience.  The pavilion and the park in general are well-known and respected for their [[accessibility]].<ref name=PVA>{{cite web|url=http://pva.convio.net/site/DocServer/PN_BFA_2005_Article.pdf?docID=1921|title=Chicago's New Class Act|accessdate=2007-12-21|year=2005|month=July|publisher=Paralyzed Veterans of America|work=PN|author=Deyer, Joshua}}</ref>

This pavilion follows a series of open-air projects by [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] designer, Frank Gehry, such as the [[Merriweather Post Pavilion]] in [[Columbia, Maryland]], the [[Concord Performing Arts Center]] in [[Concord, California]], and numerous renovations to the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood, California]]. It is also a part of a larger inner city redevelopment that includes a theater, extensive gardens and a Gehry-designed serpentine [[BP Pedestrian Bridge|pedestrian footbridge]] that buffers against street noise.<ref name=gug/> The redevelopment was part of an effort to overcome unsightly [[railroad track]]s and [[parking lot]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/environment/millennium_park.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|publisher=citymayors.com|author=Pesci, Renato|title=A people's park of international importance in downtown Chicago}}</ref> Much like his [[Experience Music Project]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], it suggests musical qualities.

[[Image:2005-10-13 2880x1920 chicago above millennium park.jpg|thumb|Pavilion from the north]]
The original design was much more modest. It had a smaller shell structure and speakers affixed to poles interspersed throughout the seating area. However, two things happened to change the original plans. [[John H. Bryan]], former [[CEO]] of the [[Sara Lee Corporation]], raised revenues to change the scope of the project. Also, Jay Pritzker's widow, Cindy, was unimpressed with the design and demanded that Gehry be involved.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/> Despite the redesign, the pavilion has its blemishes: the supporting backside along Randolph Street is controversial, and the fact that the supporting proscenium braces are left exposed is offensive to some observers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnbecker.com/repeat/Gehry/gehrybaroque.htm|accessdate=2007-09-21|title=Frank Gehry, Millennium Park and the development of the Techno-Baroque|author=Becker, Lynn|publisher=Lynn Becker |work=Repeat}}</ref>  Other people contest that the smooth rounded trellis and sharp-edged band shell are geometrically discordant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E2D61F3BF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63|title= ART/ARCHITECTURE; Big Shoulders, Big Donors, Big Art|accessdate=2008-06-01|date=[[2004-07-18]]|author=Bernstein, Fred A.|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

The Millennium Park director has been honored for his contribution to making America more accessible.  The stage is accessible by gently-sloped ramps instead of stairs as part of the overall parks accessibility aware design.<ref name=PVA/>

===Acoustics===
[[Image:20070919 Pritzker Pavilion bandshell.JPG|thumb|180px|right|The pavilion [[band shell]] is designed to reflect sound for optimal acoustics.]]
The Pritzker Pavilion uses an innovative [[LARES]] sound system, which generates reflected and reverberant energy that surrounds the audience. The system causes the sound quality to be fairly uniform throughout the entire venue, and has received critical acclaim for adaptations of its technologies such as signal processing in a variety of indoor and outdoor venues.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixfoundation.org/tec/1993.html|title=1993 TEC Awards|publisher=mixfoundation.org}}</ref> The Pritzker Pavilion is the first permanent outdoor installation of the LARES system in the United States. The trellis serves acoustic and architectural purposes because it allows for the precise placement for sound optimization without visual obstructions, as well as simultaneously providing a unifying visual canopy.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>  

[[Image:20070919 Pritzker Pavilion speakers.JPG|thumb|left|Speakers close up]]
The overall acoustic system is described as a distributed sound reinforcement system. It uses many innovative features as well as standard sound reinforcement techniques.  With this system musicians on stage are able to hear each other clearly in a way that facilitates ensemble play.  In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems.  The forward facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with clarity and proper volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers that would disturb the neighboring residences and business.<ref name=JPP,MP>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/noise/docs/urbandes/16pritzkerpavillion.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-21|title=Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Millennium Park|publisher=Talaske|work=london.gov.uk}}</ref><ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>

The trellis system has several unique features. Instead of merely reinforcing the sound like a traditional public address system, it seeks to replicate the acoustics of a concert hall, and it creates a clearly defined concert space. Sound arriving directly from lateral sources masks city disturbances. Downward facing acoustic enhancement speakers simulate sound reflection similar to indoor concert hall wall and ceiling effects.<ref name=JPP,MP/><ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>

The initial plan was that the lawn seating would be free for all events.  In fact, an early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said "You never need a ticket to attend a concert! The lawn and the general seating section are always admission free."<ref name=HocfMPc/>  When parking revenue fell short of estimates during the first year however, the city charged $10 for lawn seating at the [[August 31]][[2005]] concert by [[Tori Amos]].  The city justified this by contending that since the Pavilion is an open air venue, there were many places in Millennium Park, such as the [[Cloud Gate]], [[Crown Fountain]] and [[Lurie Garden]]s, where one could have enjoyed the sounds or the atmosphere of the park without having to pay.<ref name=HocfMPc/><ref name=CCTPVIPP/>  In a related controversy of this concert, the Gehry-designed [[BP Pedestrian Bridge]] that connects Millenium Park with [[Daley Bicentennial Plaza]] was closed until 7:00 A.M. the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=116266DCE2E9D5F0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=A bad deal all around|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=[[2005-09-09]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Wasielewski, Carl}}</ref> Amos, a classically trained musician who chose only [[piano]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]] accompaniment, earned positive reviews as the inaugural [[Rock and roll]] performer in this venue that has become a regular host to [[classical music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10CF366622FB2B70&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Amos creates musical magic as Pritzker's first rock act|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=[[2005-09-02]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Orloff, Brian}}</ref><ref name=CoTharihoc/>  In addition to charging for lawn seating, the event promoters prohibited customers from bringing any beverage, including bottled water, to the lawn; drinks instead had to be purchased onsite.<ref name=CCTPVIPP/>  The city stated later that confiscation of unopened beverage bottles was a mistake and that "Bottled water is always allowed at the free concerts we host at the park, and will be allowed at any future events as well."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10D5CE1E91AA8D70&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Bottled water hardly worth all the fuss we make of it|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=[[2005-09-21]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=[[Richard Roeper|Roeper, Richard]]}}</ref>  An estimated 300 attendees set up their blankets beyond the bounds of the trellis system where they could enjoy their own beverage while listening to the concert.<ref name=CoTharihoc>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10C60A7D8F809508&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title= Church of Tori holds a revival in heart of city|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=[[2005-09-02]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Elder, Robert K.}}</ref>  The official Chicago policy is that alcohol his permitted on throughout the Jay Pritzker Pavilion during public performance, but glass bottles and cans are not permitted on the Great Lawn.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://egov.cityofchicago.org/city/webportal/portalCategoryTreeAction.do?deptMainCategoryOID=-536887892&categoryPath=%2fCity+Agencies%2fCity+Departments%2fCity+of+Chicago%2fSub+Agencies%2fMillennium+Park%2fFAQ+Categories&success=FAQ&entityName=Millennium+Park&topChannelName=SubAgency&contentType=COC_FAQ&Failed_Reason=Invalid+timestamp,+engine+has+been+restarted&com.broadvision.session.new=Yes&Failed_Page=%2fwebportal%2fportalCategoryTreeAction.do|title=Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2008-06-08|publisher=City of Chicago}}</ref>

This was not the first controversy about the Pavilion.  In addition to the cost and time overruns, the general idea of the Pavilion to replace the long-time downtown Petrillo Music shell in Grant Park, was contrary to the wishes of the Petrillo family.  The Petrillo music shell has a long history of hosting free music events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FEA4948D70BB60A&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title='Pritzker' shell angers Petrillo kin - Granddaughter may fight naming, OKd after $15 mil. gift|accessdate=2008-06-06|date=[[2003-10-30]]|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Herrmann, Andrew and Fran Spielman}}</ref>

In addition to the various public events that the Pavilion hosts, it hosts private events.  It is available, as is the entire park, as a venue for private events year round.  The stage's design with a glass and steel door "curtain" enable it to provide indoor space protected from the elements when necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpark.org/privaterentals/pritzker/|title=Private Rentals: Photo Galleries: Jay Pritzker Pavilion|accessdate=2008-06-13|publisher=City of Chicago}}</ref>  In addition, the Pavilion has a Choral Rehearsal Room that is available for rental for private purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpark.org/privaterentals/choral/|title=Private Rentals: Photo Galleries: Choral Rehearsal Room|accessdate=2008-06-13|publisher=City of Chicago}}</ref>

[[Image:decemberists at millennium park.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Decemberists]] play a free concert with the Grant Park Orchestra]]
On [[July 18]], [[2007]], the Grant Park Music Festival partnered with the [[Metro Chicago]] to produce a free, Wednesday-night show featuring [[Independent music|indie band]] [[The Decemberists]]. The concert was a rare orchestral collaboration with the Grant Park Orchestra and featured brand-new orchestral arrangements of The Decemberists’ songs arranged and conducted by Sean O’Loughlin. While the concert was free to the public, the front seating sections of the pavilion were reserved those who had purchased season membership passes.<ref name="decemberists">{{cite web|url=http://www.grantparkmusicfestival.com/newsApril19_2007.shtml|title=The Decemberists To Make Millennium Park Debut With The Grant Park Orchestra, Wednesday Evening, July 18|accessdate=2008-06-09|publisher=grantparkmusicfestival.com}}</ref> Fans of the band began forming a line hours prior to the show in a bid to obtain the remaining first-come, first-served seats in the Pavilion. As a result, membership holders who were mostly unfamiliar with the band were seated closest to the stage, while the remaining fans were seated farther away. This audience dichotomy did not go unnoticed by Decemberists' frontman [[Colin Meloy]], as evidenced during the band's encore performance (without the orchestra) when he encouraged the crowd to breech the barriers separating the Pavilion's seats from the great lawn in order to get closer to the stage. The show had the largest attendance volume of any free concert held at Jay Pritzker Pavilion with an estimated attendance of over 10,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagoist.com/2007/07/19/the_decemberist.php|title=ReViewed: The Decemberists with the Grant Park Orchestra|accessdate=2008-06-09|date=2007-07-19work=Chicagoist}}</ref>
