'''Tropical Depression One''' in [[June 1992]] produced [[100-year flood]]s in portions of southwestern [[Florida]]. The first tropical depression and second [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season]], the depression developed on [[June 25]] from a [[tropical wave]]. Located in an environment of strong [[wind shear]], much of the [[convection]] in the system was located well to the southeast of the poorly defined center of circulation. The depression moved northeastward and struck near [[Tampa, Florida]] on [[June 26]] shortly before dissipating over land.

The depression, in combination with an upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] to its west, produced heavy rainfall to the east of its path, peaking at 33.43&nbsp;inches (849&nbsp;mm) in [[Cuba]] and 25&nbsp;inches (635&nbsp;mm) in Florida. In Cuba, the rainfall destroyed hundreds of homes and caused two fatalities. In Florida, particularly in [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota]] and [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee]] counties, the rainfall caused severe flooding. 4,000&nbsp;houses were affected, forcing thousands to evacuate. The flooding killed two in the state and was indirectly responsible for a traffic causality. Damage in Florida totaled over $2.6&nbsp;million (1992&nbsp;USD, $3.7&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).

A weak [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[June 12]]. It tracked westward across the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]] with minimal [[convection]], and subsequent to moving through the southern [[Windward Islands]] it crossed northern [[Central America]]. Convection increased on [[October 20]] as the wave entered the southwestern [[Caribbean Sea]]. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing [[1992 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Celia|Hurricane Celia]] in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid- to upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] over the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On [[June 24]], a mid-level circulation developed near the [[Yucatán Channel]], and shortly thereafer satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A [[Hurricane Hunters|reconnaissance aircraft]] flight was dispatched late on [[June 24]] into the system to determine if it developed into a [[tropical cyclone]], though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. Subsequent to the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on [[June 25]] ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235&nbsp;miles (375&nbsp;km) west-southwest of [[Key West, Florida]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch and Lixion Avila|year=1993|title=Atlantic Tropical Systems of 1992|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-23|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/122/3/pdf/i1520-0493-122-3-539.pdf}}</ref> Operationally, the [[National Hurricane Center]] incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season#Subtropical Storm One|an earlier subtropical storm]].<ref name="disc1">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=1992|title=Tropical Depression One Discussion One|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2007-02-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1992/td1/tropdisc/nal0292.001}}</ref>

Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was poorly organized, with much of the convection located well to the southeast of the broad center due to strong upper-level [[wind shear]]. The shearing environment was caused by a trough in the Gulf of Mexico and from the [[tropical cyclone#structure|outflow]] from Pacific Hurricane Celia.<ref name="mwr"/> This was reflected in forecasts, with the National Hurricane Center predicting no significant change in intensity or structure.<ref name="disc1"/> The depression moved northward before turning to the northeast,<ref name="mwr"/> and on [[June 26]] the poorly-organized system made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] just north of [[Tampa, Florida]].<ref name="disc4">{{cite web|author=Lawrence|year=1992|title=Tropical Depression One Discussion Four|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2007-02-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1992/td1/tropdisc/nal0292.004}}</ref> The low-level circulation dissipated while crossing the [[Florida|Florida peninsula]], with the remnants continuing northeastward before being absorbed by a large [[extratropical cyclone]] over the western Atlantic.<ref name="mwr"/>

On [[August 14]], about 6&nbsp;weeks after the flooding, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W.
