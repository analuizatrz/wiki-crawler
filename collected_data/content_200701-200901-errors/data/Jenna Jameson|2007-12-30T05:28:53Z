[[Image:Briana Loves Jenna.jpg|left|thumb|Cover of ''[[Briana Loves Jenna]]'' (2001), first Club Jenna produced film, best selling and best renting title of its year, starring Jameson and [[Briana Banks]].]]

Jameson and Grdina formed [[ClubJenna]] as an [[Internet pornography]] company in 2000. ClubJenna.com was one of the first pornographic sites to provide more than pictures and videos; it provided explicit diaries, relationship advice, and even stock tips to paid members. The site reportedly was profitable in its third week. The business later diversified into multi-media pornographic entertainment, first by administering other porn stars' web sites, then, in 2001, by production of pornographic films.<ref name=Forbes/>

Early Club Jenna films starred Jameson herself, limiting herself to on-screen sex with other women or with Grdina, who appeared as Justin Sterling. The first ClubJenna film, ''Briana Loves Jenna'' (2001), co-produced with Vivid, cost [[United States dollar|US$]]280,000 to make, and grossed over $1 million in its first year. It was the best selling and best renting pornographic title of its year, winning twin [[AVN Awards 2003|AVN Awards]].<ref name=Forbes/><ref name=JJJBio>[http://justjennajameson.com/bio.html JustJennaJameson.com bio] official fan site biography.

Grdina has said that Jameson's films averaged sales of 100,000 copies, compared with run-of-the-mill pornographic films, which did well to sell 5,000. On the other hand, he also said that their films took up to twelve days to film, compared with one day for other pornographic films.<ref name=WallStreetJournal/>

In November 2001, the venerable [[Oxford Union]] debating society invited Jameson to come to [[London]] to argue against the proposition "The House Believes that Porn is Harmful."<ref name=AskMenInterview/> She wrote in her diary at the time, "I feel like I am going to be out of my element, but, I could never pass this chance up... it's a once in a lifetime thing."<ref name=JJDiary>[http://jennajamesondiary.blogspot.com/2001/12/jenna-jameson-diary-november-18-2001.html Jenna Jameson's Diary : November 18, 2001] on [[Blogspot.com]].

In February 2003, [[Pony International]] planned to feature her as one of several porn stars in advertisements for [[athletic shoes]]. This was attacked by [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] of [[Fox News]] in an editorial called "Using Quasi-Prostitutes to Sell Sneakers", calling porn stars inappropriate role models for teens.<ref name=OReilly>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,79542,00.html "Using Quasi-Prostitutes to Sell Sneakers"], by [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[February 25]], [[2003]], ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', [[Fox News]].

However, these were minor appearances on the fringes of the mainstream. It was the 2004 success of her [[#Autobiography|autobiography]] that truly brought her the mass-market fame she wanted.
