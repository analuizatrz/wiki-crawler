The '''Avengers''' are a [[superhero]] team that appear in the [[fictional]] [[Marvel Universe]]. The team, comprising existing Marvel characters variously created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]], artist and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]] and others, [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''The Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 1963).  

Tagged by the company as "Earth’s Mightiest Heroes", the Avengers originally consisted of [[Henry Pym|Ant-Man]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Iron Man]], and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Almost from inception, however, the roster has  been fluid - the Hulk departed <ref>''The Avengers'' #2 (Nov. 1963)</ref> and [[Captain America]] joined the team within the first four issues of the series.<ref name="Av1n4">''The Avengers'' #4 (Mar. 1964)</ref> The rotating roster has become a hallmark of the team, although one theme remains consistent: the Avengers fight the foes no single superhero can withstand - hence their famous cry of "Avengers Assemble!" To that end, the team has featured humans, robots, gods, aliens, supernatural beings and even former villains. 

==Publication history==
{{see also|Bibliography of Avengers titles}}

The titular team debuted in ''The Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 1963), using existing characters created primarily by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and [[penciler]] and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]]. This initial series, published bi-monthly through issue #6 (July 1964) and monthly thereafter ran through issue #402 (Sept. 1996), with spinoffs including several [[annual publications|annuals]], [[miniseries]] and a giant-size quarterly sister series than ran briefly in the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=1571|title=Avengers, The (1963 Series)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref>

Other spinoff series include ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'', initially published as a four-issue miniseries in 1984, followed by a 102-issue series (Oct. 1995 - Jan. 1994), retitled ''Avengers West Coast'' with #48;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=3061|title=West Coast Avengers (1985 Series)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=3830|title=Avengers West Coast (1989 Series)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref> and the 40-issue ''[[Solo Avengers]]'' (Dec. 1987 - Jan. 1991), retitled ''Avengers Spotlight'' with #21.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=3435|title=Solo Avengers (1987 Series)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=3829|title=Avengers Spotlight (1989 Series)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref>

Between 1996 and 2004 Marvel relaunched the primary Avengers title three times. In 1996, the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" line, in which Marvel contracted outside companies to produce four titles, included a new volume of ''The Avengers''. Taking place in an [[alternate universe]] with a revamped history unrelated to mainstream Marvel continuity, ''The Avengers'' vol. 2 was written by [[Rob Liefeld]] and penciled by [[Jim Valentino]] of [[Image Comics]], and ran 13 issues (Nov. 1996 - Nov. 1997). The final issue, which featured a crossover with the other "Heroes Reborn" titles, returned the characters to the main [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=7252|title=Avengers (1996 series)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref>

Relaunched with a new first issue, ''The Avengers'' vol. 3 ran 84 issues (Feb. 1998 - Aug. 2004). Then, to to coincide with what would have been the 500th issue of the original series, Marvel changed the numbering to release ''The Avengers'' #500-503 (Sept.-Dec. 2004)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=11637|title=Avengers (2004 Series)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref>, followed by the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Avengers Finale'' (Jan. 2005),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=224494|title=Avengers Finale |accessdate=2008-04-24|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref> which together presented the [[Avengers Disassembled]] storyline.  That story, in which the Avengers disband following the insanity of one member ([[Scarlet Witch]]) and the death of two others ([[Ant-Man]] and [[Hawkeye]]), led to the series ''[[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'', which premiered with a new issue #1 (Jan. 2005)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=12464|title=New Avengers (2005 Series)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref> and featured an "All-Star" format similar to DC's [[Justice League of America]], with ultra-popular characters [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] becoming core members of the team for the first time.

In the wake of the success of the ''New Avengers'' title, two spin-offs debuted.  The first, ''[[Young Avengers]]'' (February 2005), featured teenage heroes patterned after former members of the Avengers. During the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', a sister title to ''New Avengers'', entitled ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'', began with #1 in (May 2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=22524|title=The Mighty Avengers |accessdate=2008-04-24|publisher=Grand Comicbook Database}}</ref>, at which point the "New" and "Mighty" versions of the team were differentiated from one another based on the loyalties of their members to the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|registration acts]] passed during the Superhero Civil War.

==Fictional biography==
===1960s===
[[Image:Avengers-1.jpg|195px|thumb|left|''The Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 1963). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Dick Ayers]].]]
The first issue features the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian]] [[trickster]] god, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who seeks revenge against his adopted brother, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Using an illusion, Loki tricks the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into destroying a railroad track, and then diverts a radio call by [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] for help to Thor, whom Loki hopes will battle the Hulk. Unknown to Loki, the radio call is also answered by [[Henry Pym|Ant-Man]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and [[Iron Man]].  After an initial misunderstanding, the heroes unite and defeat Loki. Ant-Man points out that the five work well together and suggests they form a combined team — with the Wasp naming the group the Avengers. The original members are known as the "founding members," and courtesy of an Avengers Charter are responsible for the good name of the team. As a result, their wishes regarding the direction of the team are given additional weight and deference.  

The roster changes almost immediately; by the beginning of the second issue, Ant-Man has become Giant-Man and, at the end of the issue, the Hulk leaves once he realizes how much the others fear his unstable personality. Feeling responsible, the Avengers try to locate and contain the Hulk (a recurring theme in the early years of the team), which subsequently leads them into combat with [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. This would result in the first major milestone in the Avengers' history - the revival and return of Captain America.<ref name="Av1n4"/> Captain America joins the team eventually becoming field leader. Captain America is also given "founding member" status in the Hulk's place. <ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 (Feb. 1998) Marvel Comics</ref> The Avengers go on to fight foes such as Captain America's wartime enemy [[Baron Zemo]], who in turn forms the [[Masters of Evil]]; the [[subterranea (comics)|Lava Men]]; [[Kang the Conqueror]]; [[Wonder Man]]; [[Immortus]]; and [[Count Nefaria]].

The next milestone came when every member but Captain America resigns and is replaced by three former villains - [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref> Although lacking the raw power of the original team, "Cap's Kooky Quartet" (as they were sometimes jokingly called) proved their worth by fighting and defeating the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]; the original [[Erik Josten|Power Man]]; [[Doctor Doom]] and Kang once again. They are soon rejoined by Henry Pym (who changes his name to Goliath), the Wasp, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], although the last two do not obtain official membership status until later in the book's history. 

Under the tenure of [[Roy Thomas]] as writer, the stories begin to focus more intently on characterization. The [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] joins the team, followed by the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Thomas also established that the Avengers are headquartered in a [[New York City]] building called [[Avengers Mansion]], provided courtesy of Tony Stark (Iron Man's alter ego), who also funds the Avengers through the Maria Stark Foundation, a [[non-profit organization]]. The mansion is serviced by [[Edwin Jarvis]], the Avengers' faithful butler, and also furnished with [[state of the art|state-of-the-art]] technology and defense systems, including the Avengers' primary mode of transport: the five-engine Quinjets.

===1970s===
[[Image:Avengers-176.jpg|thumb|The Avengers face [[Korvac]] on the cover of ''The Avengers'' #176 (Oct. 1978). Art by Dave Wenzel.]]
Thomas continued his run into the early 1970s, with highlights including a version of the [[Justice League]] called the [[Squadron Supreme]] and the [[Kree-Skrull War]], a ten-part storyline about an epic battle between the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] races and guest-starring the Kree hero [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]. This storyline also features the first disbanding of the Avengers, as Skrulls impersonating Captain America, Thor and Iron Man use their authority as founders of the team to disband it. The true founding Avengers, minus the Wasp, reform the team in the 100th issue in response to complaints from Jarvis.

The Vision falls in love with the Scarlet Witch, who eventually responds with a love of her own. Their relationship, however, is tinged with sadness as the Vision believes himself to be inhuman and unworthy of her. 

Writer [[Steve Englehart]] continued with the emphasis on the cosmic, introducing [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], who joins the team along with the reformed Swordsman. Englehart linked her origins to the very beginnings of the Kree-Skrull conflict in a time-spanning adventure involving Kang the Conqueror and the mysterious [[Immortus]], who are revealed to be past and future versions of each other. Mantis is revealed to be the Celestial Madonna, who is destined to give birth to a being that would save the universe. This saga also reveals that the Vision's body had only been appropriated, and not created, by Ultron, and that it had originally belonged to the 1940s [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]. With his origins now clear to him, the Vision finally summons up the courage to propose to the Scarlet Witch. The Celestial Madonna saga ends with their wedding, presided over by Immortus, a future version of Kang.

Englehart's tenure coincided with the debut of [[George Pérez]] as artist. <ref>''The Avengers'' #141 (Aug. 1975)</ref> After Englehart's departure, [[Jim Shooter]] began as writer and penned several story arcs including "Bride of Ultron", the "Nefaria Trilogy" and "The [[Korvac]] Saga", featuring nearly every Avenger in the canon. New members added during this time include the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]; a resurrected [[Wonder Man]]; Captain America's former partner the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]; and [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]. 

Shooter also introduced the character of [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], the Avengers' liaison to the [[United States National Security Council]]. Gyrich is prejudiced against superhumans, and acts in a heavy-handed, obstructive manner, insisting that the Avengers follow government rules and regulations or else lose their priority status with the government. Among Gyrich's demands is that the active roster be trimmed down to only seven members, and that the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], an [[African American]], be admitted to the team to comply with [[affirmative action]] laws. This last action is particularly resented by Hawkeye, who because of the seven-member limit loses his slot to the Falcon. The Falcon, in turn, is unhappy to be the beneficiary of what he perceives to be [[tokenism]], and decides to resign from the team, after which Hawkeye rejoins.

===1980s===
[[Image:Avengers200.jpg|thumb|left|''The Avengers'' #200 (Oct. 1980). Cover art by [[George Pérez]]  [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]].]]
Shooter's greatest contribution during this period was a storyline that chronicled the breakdown of Henry Pym. Shooter saw Pym's frequent changes of costume and name as symptomatic of an identity problem and an [[inferiority complex]]. After abusing his wife; failing to win back the confidence of the Avengers with a ruse and being duped by the villain [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], Pym is jailed. The main writer during the 80's was [[Roger Stern]], who resolved the Pym storyline by having Pym outwit Egghead and defeat the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil single-handedly, thereby proving his innocence. Pym reconciles with the Wasp, but they decide to remain apart. Pym also retires from superheroics, but returns some years later.

Stern developed several major storylines, such as "Ultimate Vision"; the formation of the West Coast Avengers; and "[[Avengers Under Siege]]" (which involves the second [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]]) and "War on Olympus". New members during the 1980s included an African American Captain Marvel named [[Monica Rambeau]] (who became the team's new leader); [[She-Hulk]]; [[Tigra]], Namor, and Hawkeye's wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], while Henry Pym emerges from retirement to join the West Coast Avengers. The team also relocated for a period to a floating island off the coast of New York called Hydrobase.

[[John Byrne]] eventually took over writing both titles. His contributions included a revamping of the Vision, and the discovery that the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision are actually illusions. The loss of the Scarlet Witch's children and the Vision drives her insane, although she eventually recovers and rejoins the team. The destruction of Avengers Island during [[Acts of Vengeance]] leads to building a new facility on the Mansion site.

===1990s===
The 90s were a turbulent time for Marvel Comics, as the company adopted an aggressive business expansion model tied to increased publication. This coincided with a speculators' boom, followed by an industry-wide slump and Marvel filing for [[bankruptcy]] in 1997). [[Bob Harras]] and [[Steve Epting]] took over the title, and introduced a stable lineup with ongoing storylines and character development focused on the Black Knight, [[Sersi]], [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], Quicksilver, Hercules and the Vision. During this period, the team finds themselves facing increasingly murderous enemies, and are forced to question their rule against killing.

This culminated in "[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]", a 19-part storyline that ran through all Avengers-related titles and showcases a conflict between the Kree and the [[Shi'ar|Shi'ar Empire]]. The team splits when Iron Man and several dissidents execute the [[Supreme Intelligence]] against the wishes of Captain America.

After a vote disbanding the West Coast Avengers, Iron Man forms a proactive and aggressive team called [[Force Works]]. During the team's first mission Wonder Man is apparently killed again (his atoms are actually only temporarily scattered). Force Works later disbands after it is revealed that Iron Man has become a murderer via of the manipulations of the villain Kang. <ref>''Force Works'' concluded its run with issue #22 (Apr 1996).</ref>

===="Heroes Reborn"====
[[Image:AvengersVolume2.jpg||thumb|''Avengers'' vol. 2, #11 (Sept. 1997), showing the [[Heroes Reborn]] Avengers. Cover art by [[Michael Ryan (comics)|Michael Ryan]] and [[Sal Regla]].]]
Together with the [[Fantastic Four]] and others, many of the Avengers apparently die stopping the gestalt psychic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], although it is later revealed that [[Franklin Richards]] preserves these heroes in a pocket universe ("[[Heroes Reborn]]"). Believing the main team gone, the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] disbands the Avengers, with only butler Jarvis remaining to tend to the Mansion.

Marvel contracted out ''The Avengers'' and three related titles - ''Captain America'', ''Fantastic Four'', and ''Iron Man'' - to former Marvel artists [[Jim Lee]] and [[Rob Liefeld]], two of the founding creators of [[Image Comics]]. The previous continuity of the [[Marvel Universe]] was set aside as the heroes were "reborn" in the pocket universe. While the ''Avengers'' was relaunched as a new series, the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" line ended after a year as planned and the license reverted to Marvel. <sup>[see [[#Publication history|publication history]]]</sup>

===="Heroes Return"====
Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] and penciler [[George Pérez]] launched a new volume of the series with ''Avengers'' #1 (vol. 3, Feb. 1998). Busiek also concurrently wrote the [[limited series]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]'', a [[time-travel]] story that explored the history of the Avengers and resolved many outstanding questions and loose ends. New members during this run included the former Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers (now Warbird); the revived Wonder Man; [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]]; [[Firestar]]; [[Silverclaw]]; and [[Triathlon (comics)|Triathlon]].

==="Avengers Disassembled"===
Pérez eventually left the title after nearly three years and Busiek remained on longer and completed his run with a story arc involving the despotic time-travel master Kang and the destruction of several cities. Successor writer [[Geoff Johns]] dealt with the aftermath, as the Avengers are granted international authority by the [[United Nations]]. Members joining during this period included [[Jack of Hearts]] and the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]. [[Chuck Austen]] followed as writer, and added a new [[Lionheart (comics)|Captain Britain]] to the team. Writer Brian Michael Bendis then rebooted the title with the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" storyline. <ref>The "Avengers Disassembled" story ran through several titles, with the final chapters featured in ''The Avengers'' #500-#503 (Sept.-Dec. 2004).</ref> Titled "Chaos", the story featured the deaths of some members and a loss of credibility for the team. The culprit is revealed to be the [[Scarlet Witch]], who has gone insane after agonizing over the memory of her lost children and who subsequently loses control of her reality-altering powers. <ref>The story of the Scarlet Witch continued in the biweekly limited series ''House of M'' #1-8 (Aug.-Dec. 2005)</ref> With the team in disarray and Avengers Mansion ruined, the surviving members agree to disband.

===New Avengers===
{{main|New Avengers (comics)}}
[[Image:New avengers sketch.jpg|Variant cover art for ''New Avengers'' #1, by Joe Quesada and Richard Isanove. (Feb 2005)|thumb]]
With the original Avengers organization disbanded, and faced with an escape attempt from the Raft, a supervillian prison, a new team formed using the [[New Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] name. Though three members of the new team ([[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Spider-Man]]) had been members of the original Avengers, the New Avengers did not resume that team's original charters. The initial version of this team included [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|the Sentry]].

===Mighty Avengers===
{{main|Mighty Avengers}}
Following the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], an Avengers team formed under the Initiative program took up residency in New York City. Their roster includes [[Black Widow]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], [[Wonder Man]], [[Iron Man]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|The Sentry]], and is led by [[Ms. Marvel]].
