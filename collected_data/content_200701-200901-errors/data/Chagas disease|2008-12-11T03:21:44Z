'''Chagas disease''' ({{lang-pt|doença de Chagas}}, {{lang-es|enfermedad de Chagas}}, ''mal de Chagas'' in both languages; also called '''American trypanosomiasis''') is a [[tropical disease|tropical]] [[parasitic disease]] caused by the [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''. ''T. cruzi'' is commonly transmitted to humans and other mammals by an insect [[Vector (biology)|vector]], the [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] [[assassin bug]]s of the subfamily [[Triatominae]] (family [[Reduviidae]]) most commonly species belonging to the ''[[Triatoma]]'', ''[[Rhodnius]]'', and ''[[Panstrongylus]]'' genera. The disease may also be spread through [[blood transfusion]] and [[organ transplantation]], ingestion of food contaminated with [[parasite]]s, and [[vertical transmission|from a mother to her fetus]].

The symptoms of Chagas disease vary over the course of an infection. In the early, acute stage, symptoms are mild and usually produce no more than local swelling at the site of infection. As the disease progresses, over the course of many years, serious chronic symptoms can appear, such as [[heart disease]] and malformation of the [[intestine]]s. If untreated, the chronic disease is often fatal. Current drug treatments are generally unsatisfactory; available medications are highly toxic and often ineffective, particularly those used to treat the chronic stage of the disease.

Chagas disease occurs exclusively in the [[Americas]], particularly in poor, rural areas of [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and [[South America]]; very rarely, the disease has originated in the [[Southern United States]]. The insects that spread the disease are known by various local names, including ''vinchuca'' in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay, ''barbeiro'' (the [[barber surgeon|barber]]) in Brazil, ''Pito'' in Colombia, ''chipo'', ''chupança'', ''chinchorro'', and "the kissing bug". It is estimated that as many as 8 to 11 million people in Mexico, Central America, and South America have Chagas disease, most of whom do not know they are infected. Large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas of Latin America and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution of Chagas disease. Control strategies have mostly focused on eliminating the triatomine vector and preventing transmission from other sources.<ref name=CDC/>

==History==

[[Image:Carlos Chagas.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos Chagas]]]]

The disease was named after the [[Brazil]]ian [[physician]] and [[Infectology|infectologist]] [[Carlos Chagas]], who first described it in 1909,<ref name=Chagas_1909>{{cite journal | author = Chagas C | title = Neue Trypanosomen | journal = Vorläufige Mitteilung Arch Schiff Tropenhyg | year = 1909 | volume = 13 | pages = 120–2 }}</ref><ref name=Redhead_2006>{{cite journal | author=Redhead SA, Cushion MT, Frenkel JK, Stringer JR | title=''Pneumocystis'' and ''Trypanosoma cruzi'': nomenclature and typifications | journal=J Eukaryot Microbiol | year=2006 | pages=2–11 | volume=53 | issue=1 | pmid=16441572 | doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2005.00072.x}}</ref> but the disease was not seen as a major [[public health]] problem in humans until the 1960s (the outbreak of Chagas disease in Brazil in the 1920s went widely ignored<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0021-1753%28199906%2990%3A2%3C397%3AHAOAT%28%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H|format=fee required|author= Coutinho M| title= Review of ''Historical Aspects of American Trypanosomiasis (Chagas' Disease)'' by Matthias Perleth |journal= Isis | volume= 90 |issue= 2 |month= June | year= 1999| pages= 397|doi=10.1086/384393 }}</ref>). He discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae harbored a flagellate protozoan, a new species of the ''[[Trypanosoma]]'' genus, and was able to prove experimentally that it could be transmitted to [[marmoset]] monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed that [[squirrel monkey]]s were also vulnerable to infection.<ref name=Hulsebos_1989>{{cite journal |author=Hulsebos LH, Choromanski L, Kuhn RE |title=The effect of interleukin-2 on parasitemia and myocarditis in experimental Chagas' disease |journal=J Protozool |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=293–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2499678}}</ref>

Chagas named the [[pathogen]]ic parasite that causes the disease ''Trypanosoma cruzi''<ref name=Chagas_1909 /> and later that year as ''Schizotrypanum cruzi'',<ref name=Chagas_1909b>{{cite journal | author = Chagas C| title = Nova tripanozomiase humana: Estudos sobre a morfolojia e o ciclo evolutivo do Schizotrypanum cruzi n. gen., n. sp., ajente etiolojico de nova entidade morbida do homem [New human trypanosomiasis.

Chagas’ work is unique in the [[history of medicine]] because he was the only researcher so far to  describe ''solely'' and completely a new [[infectious disease]]: its [[pathogen]], [[Vector (biology)|vector]], [[Host (biology)|host]], clinical manifestations, and epidemiology.
[[Image:Trypanosoma cruzi heart.jpg|left|thumb|''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in monkey heart. Histopathology.]]

Nevertheless, he believed (falsely) until 1925 that the main infection route is by the bite of the insect—and not by its [[feces]], as was proposed by his colleague [[Emile Brumpt]] in 1915 and assured by [[Silveira Dias]] in 1932, Cardoso in 1938, and Brumpt himself in 1939. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|''Pneumocystis'']], later infamously to be linked to PCP ([[Pneumocystis pneumonia]] in AIDS victims).<ref name=Redhead_2006 /> Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus ''Schizotrypanum'', but following the description of ''Pneumocystis'' by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name ''Trypanosoma cruzi''.

It has been hypothesized that [[Charles Darwin]] might have suffered from Chagas disease as a result of a bite of the so-called Great Black Bug of the [[Pampas]] (vinchuca) (see [[Charles Darwin's illness]]). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the [[Andes]] near [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at the [[Westminster Abbey]] by using modern [[PCR]] techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's [[curator]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Adler D | title=Darwin's Illness | journal=Isr J Med Sci | volume=25 | issue=4 | pages=218–21 | year=1989 | pmid=2496051}}</ref>

==Transmission==
[[Image:Trypanosoma cruzi LifeCycle.gif|thumb|400px|Life cycle and transmission of ''[[T. cruzi]]''. Source: CDC]]
In Chagas-endemic areas, the main mode of transmission is through a insect vector called a triatomine bug.<ref name=CDC/> A triatomine becomes infected with ''T. cruzi'' by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomine hide in crevices in the walls and roofs. The bugs emerge at night, when the inhabitants are sleeping. Because they tend to feed on people’s faces, triatomine bugs are also known as “kissing bugs.” After they bite and ingest blood, they defecate on the person. Triatomine pass ''T. cruzi'' parasites (called [[trypomastigote]]s) in feces left near the site of the bite wound. Scratching the site of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound, or through intact [[mucous membranes]], such as the [[conjunctiva]]. Once inside the host the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they differentiate into intracellular [[amastigote]]s. The amastigotes multiply by [[binary fission]] and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then are released into the bloodstream. This cycle is repeated in each newly infected cell. Replication resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector.<ref name=CDC/>

''T. cruzi'' can also be transmitted through [[blood transfusions]], [[organ transplant]]ation, [[breast milk]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Santos Ferreira C, Amato Neto V, Gakiya E, Bezerra RC, Alarcón RS |title=Microwave treatment of human milk to prevent transmission of Chagas disease |journal=Rev Inst Med Trop São Paulo |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |year=2003 |pmid=12751321 |doi=}}</ref> and by accidental laboratory exposure. Chagas disease can also be spread congenitally (from a pregnant woman to her baby) through the [[placenta]], and accounts for approximately 13% of stillborn deaths in parts of Brazil.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hudson L, Turner MJ |title=Immunological consequences of infection and vaccination in South American trypanosomiasis [and discussion] |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond, B, Biol Sci |volume=307 |issue=1131 |pages=51–61 |year=1984 |month=November |pmid=6151688 |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2990154 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1984.0108}} Retrieved February 22, 2007 through [[JSTOR]].</ref>

In 1991 farm workers in the state of [[Paraíba]], Brazil, were infected by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated [[açaí palm]] fruit juice and [[garapa|sugar cane juice]].<ref>{{cite journal |year=2005 |month=April |title=Chagas’ disease (American trypanosomiasis) in southern Brazil |journal=CDR Weekly |volume=15 |issue=13 |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/CDR/archives/2005/cdr1305.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=United Kingdom [[Health Protection Agency]] |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Shikanai-Yasuda MA, Marcondes CB, Guedes LA, ''et al'' |title=Possible oral transmission of acute Chagas' disease in Brazil |journal=Rev Inst Med Trop São Paulo |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=351–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1844961 |doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=da Silva Valente SA, de Costa Valente V, Neto HF |title=Considerations on the epidemiology and transmission of Chagas disease in the Brazilian Amazon |journal=Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz |volume=94 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=395–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10677763 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0074-0276(99)09400077&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref> Despite many warnings in the press and by health authorities, this source of infection continues unabated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u321060.shtml |title=Açaí faz 1 vítima de Chagas a cada 4 dias na Amazônia |author=Reis, T |date=August 18, 2007 |work=[[Folha de São Paulo]] |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

==Clinical manifestations==

The human disease occurs in two stages: an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] stage, which occurs shortly after an initial [[infection]], and a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] stage that develops over many years.

[[Image:Heart pathology Chagas disease.JPG|thumb|Gross anatomy of a heart that has been damaged by chronic Chagas Disease. See also: [[:Image:Heart radiology Chagas disease.JPG|Chagas heart, radiology]]]]

The acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom free or exhibits only mild symptoms and signs that are not unique to Chagas disease. The symptoms noted by the patient can include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a [[chagoma]]) where the parasite entered the body. The most recognized marker of acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes swelling of the eyelids on the side of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Even if symptoms develop during the acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within 3–8 weeks in approximately 90% of individuals.<ref name=emedicine>Carlier Y (27 February 2003). [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic327.htm Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis).] [[eMedicine]]. Retrieved on 11 September 2008.</ref> Although the symptoms resolve, the infection, if untreated, persists.  Rarely, young children (<5%), or adults die from severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle ([[myocarditis]]) or brain ([[meningoencephalitis]]).<ref name=Guimaraes1968>{{cite journal | author= Guimarães FN, da Silva NN, Clausell DT, de Mello AL, Rapone T, Snell T, Rodrigues N| title=Um surto epidêmico de doença de Chagas de provável transmissão digestiva, ocorrido em Teutonia (Estrêla - Rio Grande Do Sul) | journal=Hospital (Rio J) | volume=73 | issue=6 | pages=1767–804| year=1968 |url=http://en.calameo.com/read/00000948401a1fdb85f76}}</ref> The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.<ref name=CDC/>  In about 10% of infections the symptoms do not completely resolve and result in a so-called chronic latent or indeterminate asymptomatic phase of the disease.

Several years or even decades after initial infection, an estimated 30% of infected people will develop medical problems from Chagas disease over the course of their lives. The symptomatic chronic stage affects the [[nervous system]], [[digestive system]] and [[heart]]. About two thirds of people with chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including [[cardiomyopathy]], which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one third of patients go on to develop [[digestive system]] damage, resulting in dilation of the [[digestive tract]] ([[megacolon]] and [[megaesophagus]]), accompanied by severe [[weight loss]]. [[Swallowing]] difficulties may be the first symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to [[malnutrition]]. Twenty to fifty percent of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement.<ref name=emedicine/> A small percentage of individuals develop various neurological disorders, including [[dementia]]. The clinical manifestations of Chagas disease are due to cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an [[inflammatory response]], cellular [[lesions]], and [[fibrosis]]. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart [[aneurysm]]s, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.<ref name=emedicine/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Trypanosoma cruzi crithidia.jpeg|thumb|left|Photomicrograph of [[Giemsa]]-stained ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' ([[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]])]]

The presence of ''T. cruzi'' is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It can be detected by [[microscope|Microscopic]] examination of fresh anti-[[coagulate]]d [[blood]], or its [[buffy coat]], for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]], for direct visualization of [[parasites]]. Microscopically, ''T. cruzi'' can be confused with ''[[Trypanosoma rangeli]]'', which is not known to be pathogenic in humans. Isolation of ''T. cruzi'' can occur by inoculation into [[mouse|mice]], by culture in specialized media (e.g., NNN, LIT); and by [[xenodiagnosis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author= Brumpt E| title=Le xénodiagnostic. Application au diagnostic de quelques infections parasitaires et en particulier à la trypanosomose de Chagas | journal=Bull Soc Pathol Exot | volume=7 | issue=10 | pages=706–10| year=1914 |url=http://www.pathexo.fr/documents/articles-bull/1914/1914n10/T7-10-706.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> where uninfected [[Reduviidae]] bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.<ref name= emedicine/>

Various [[immunoassay]]s for ''T. cruzi'' are available and can be used to distinguish among [[Strain (biology)|strains]] ([[zymodeme]]s of ''T.cruzi'' with divergent pathogenicities). These tests include: detecting [[complement fixation]], indirect [[hemagglutination]], indirect [[fluorescence]] assays, [[radioimmunoassay]]s, and [[ELISA]]. Alternatively diagnosis and strain identification can be made using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).<ref name= emedicine/>

==Treatment==
[[Image:Chagas megaseophagus.JPG|thumb|Chagas megaesophagus]]
There are two approaches to treating Chagas disease, [[antiparasitic]] treatment, to kill the parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of infection.

Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include [[azole]] or [[nitro]] derivatives such as [[benznidazole]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garcia S, Ramos CO, Senra JF, ''et al'' |title=Treatment with benznidazole during the chronic phase of experimental Chagas' disease decreases cardiac alterations |journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|Antimicrob Agents Chemother]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=1521–8 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15793134 |pmc=1068607 |doi=10.1128/AAC.49.4.1521-1528.2005 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15793134}}</ref> or [[nifurtimox]]. However, resistance to these drugs has been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buckner FS, Wilson AJ, White TC, Van Voorhis WC |title=Induction of resistance to azole drugs in ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=3245–50 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9835521 |pmc=106029 |doi= |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9835521}}</ref> Moreover, 10-year study of chronic administration of antiparasitic drugs in Brazil has revealed that current drug treatment regimens do not fully remove [[parasitemia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lauria-Pires L, Braga MS, Vexenat AC, ''et al'' |title=Progressive chronic Chagas heart disease ten years after treatment with anti-''Trypanosoma cruzi'' nitroderivatives |journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg |volume=63 |issue=3–4 |pages=111–8 |year=2000 |pmid=11388500 |doi= |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11388500}}</ref>

In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For example, [[pacemaker]]s and medications for irregular heartbeats may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease, while [[surgery]] may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for [[heart transplantation]] surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a [[contraindication]] for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the [[immunosuppression]] that follows surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bocchi EA, Bellotti G, Mocelin AO, ''et al'' |title=Heart transplantation for chronic Chagas' heart disease |journal=Ann Thorac Surg |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1727–33 |year=1996 |month=June |pmid=8651775 |doi=10.1016/0003-4975(96)00141-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0003-4975(96)00141-5}}</ref> It was noted that survival rates in Chagas patients could be significantly improved by using lower dosages of the immunosuppressant drug [[cyclosporin]]. Recently, direct [[stem cell therapy]] of the heart muscle using [[bone marrow]] cell transplantation has been shown to dramatically reduce risks of heart failure in Chagas patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vilas-Boas F, Feitosa GS, Soares MB, ''et al'' |title=[Early results of bone marrow cell transplantation to the myocardium of patients with heart failure due to Chagas disease] |language=Portuguese |journal=Arq Bras Cardiol |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=159–66 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16951834 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0066-782X2006001500014&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>

Blood transfusion is the second most common transmission route of Chagas disease in many Latin American countries. In 1993 a series of [[serology|serologic]] surveys, looking for antibodies against ''T. cruzi'' in blood donors, revealed that the probability of receiving a potentially infected transfusion unit in each country varied from 1.4% to 18% in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, and can be up to 48% in Bolivia.

==Distribution==
Chagas disease affects 16–18 million people as of 2008, with some 100 million (25% of the Latin American population) at risk of acquiring the disease,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbri.org/diseases/chagas.asp |title=Chagas' Disease |year=2008 |publisher=Seattle Biomedical Research Institute|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref> killing around 50,000 people annually.<ref name= emedicine/>

The disease is present in 18 countries on the American continent, ranging from the southern [[United States]] to southern [[Argentina]].<ref name=CDC>{{cite web|publisher=Centers for Disease Control (CDC) |url= http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/TrypanosomiasisAmerican.htm |title=DPDx&nbsp;– Trypanosomiasis, American. Fact Sheet |accessdate= 2008-09-11}}</ref>  Chagas exists in two different ecological zones. In the [[Southern Cone]] region the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where triatomine breed and feed on the over 150 species from 24 families of domestic and wild mammals, as well as humans, that are the [[natural reservoir]]s of ''T.cruzi''.<ref name= NatRev/> Although Triatominae bugs feed on birds, they appear to be immune against infection and therefore are not considered to be a ''T. cruzi'' reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals that are part of the ancient, [[sylvatic]] (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.<ref>{{cite conference | author = Pinto-Dias JC | year = 1992 | title = Epidemiology of Chagas disease | conference = ISBT Brazil '92.

Dense vegetation (such as that of tropical [[rainforest]]s) and urban habitats are not ideal for the establishment of the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the sylvatic [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and it's fauna are thinned by economical exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly [[deforestation|deforested]] areas, [[piassava palm]] culture areas, and some parts of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Teixeira AR, Monteiro PS, Rebelo JM, ''et al'' |title=Emerging Chagas disease: trophic network and cycle of transmission of ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' from palm trees in the Amazon |journal=Emerging Infect Dis |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=100–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11266300 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no1/teixeira.htm}}</ref>

The primary wildlife reservoirs for ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in the United States include [[opossum]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[woodrat]]s and [[mice]].<ref name=Karsten92/>  Opossums are particularly important as reservoirs because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of the animal without having to re-enter the insect vector.<ref name=Karsten92>{{cite journal |author=Karsten V, Davis C, Kuhn R |title=''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in wild raccoons and opossums in North Carolina |journal=J Parasitol |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=547–9 |year=1992 |month=June |pmid=1597808 |doi=10.2307/3283667}}</ref> Recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the U.S. ranges from 8.3%<ref name=Karsten92/> up to 37.5%.<ref name=Barr91>{{cite journal |author=Barr SC, Brown CC, Dennis VA, Klei TR |title=The lesions and prevalence of ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in opossums and armadillos from southern Louisiana |journal=J Parasitol |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=624–7 |year=1991 |month=August |pmid=1907654 |doi=10.2307/3283170}}</ref>  Studies on raccoons in the Southeast have yielded infection rates ranging from 47%<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yabsley MJ, Noblet GP |title=Seroprevalence of ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in raccoons from South Carolina and Georgia |journal=J Wildl Dis |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=75–83 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11838232 |url=http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11838232}}</ref> to as low as 15.5%.<ref name=Karsten92/> Armadillo prevalence studies have been described in Louisiana and range from a low of 1.1%<ref name=Barr91/> up to 28.8%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yaeger RG |title=The prevalence of ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' infection in armadillos collected at a site near New Orleans, Louisiana |journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=323–6 |year=1988 |month=March |pmid=3128127 |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3128127}}</ref>  Additionally small rodents including squirrels, mice and rats are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors.

Chronic Chagas disease remains a major health problem in many [[Latin America]]n countries, despite the effectiveness of hygienic and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects, which have reduced to zero new infections in at least two countries of the region. With increased population movements, however, the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion has become more substantial in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirchhoff LV |title=American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease)—a tropical disease now in the United States |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=329 |issue=9 |pages=639–44 |year=1993 |month=August |pmid=8341339 |doi= |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=8341339&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref> Approximately 500,000 infected people live in the United States, which is likely the result of [[immigration]] from Latin American countries.<ref>{{cite web| publisher= National Institutes of Health |url= http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001372.htm |title=Medical Encyclopedia: Chagas disease |accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref>

Several landmarks have been achieved in the fight against Chagas disease in Latin America including a reduction by 72% of the incidence of human infection in children and young adults in the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] Initiative, and at least two countries ([[Uruguay]], in 1997, and [[Chile]], in 1999) have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steele LS, MacPherson DW, Kim J, Keystone JS, Gushulak BD |title=The sero-prevalence of antibodies to ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in Latin American refugees and immigrants to Canada |journal=J Immigr Minor Health |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17006766 |doi=10.1007/s10903-006-9014-x |url=}}</ref><ref name= TDR1>{{cite press release |url=http://www.who.int/tdr/publications/tdrnews/news65/chagas.htm |title=The Southern Cone Initiative: an update |work=Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) |publisher=WHO|year=2004|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref> In Argentina vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces.<ref name= TDR1/> Brazil has also been certified free of ''T. infestans'' transmission,<ref name="pmid18053273">{{cite journal |author=Massad E |title=The elimination of Chagas' disease from Brazil |journal=Epidemiol Infect |volume=136 |issue=9 |pages=1153–64 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18053273 |doi=10.1017/S0950268807009879 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0950268807009879}}</ref> although other vectors, particularly ''T. brasiliensis'' and ''T. pseudomaculata'', account for most transmission in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]].<ref name=Jr2001>{{cite journal | author = Ramos Jr AN, Carvalho DM | year = 2001 | title = Os diferentes significados da certificação conferida ao Brasil como estando livre da doença de Chagas | journal = Cadernos de Saúde Pública | language = Portuguese | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 1403–12 | doi = 10.1590/S0102-311X2001000600024 | url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-311X2001000600024&lng=en&nrm=iso}}</ref>
