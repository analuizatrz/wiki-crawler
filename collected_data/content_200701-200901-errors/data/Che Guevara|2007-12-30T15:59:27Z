}}'''Ernesto Guevara de la Serna''' ([[June 14]], [[1928]]<ref name=birthdate /> – [[October 9]], [[1967]]), commonly known as '''Che Guevara,''' '''El Che''' or just '''Che''' was an [[Argentina|Argentine]]-born [[Marxist]] [[revolutionary]], [[politician|political figure]], and leader of [[Cuba]]n and [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] [[guerrillas]].

As a young man studying [[medicine]], Guevara travelled rough throughout [[South America]], bringing him into direct contact with the impoverished conditions in which many people lived. His experiences and observations during these trips led him to the conclusion that the region's socio-economic inequalities could only be remedied by socialism through revolution, prompting him to intensify his study of [[Marxism]] and travel to [[Guatemala]] to learn about the reforms being implemented there by President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]].

While in [[Mexico]] in 1956, Guevara joined [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[revolutionary]] [[26th of July Movement]], which seized power from the regime of the dictator<ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9038387/Che-Guevara Che Guevara.

In the months after the success of the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution]], Guevara was assigned the role of "supreme prosecutor", overseeing the public [[show trials]] and [[executions]] of hundreds of military and civilian leaders associated with the previous regime.<ref>"Many of Batista's military and civilian leaders were given public show trials. Hundreds were executed and the government confiscated their properties." (Source: ''"The History of Cuba"'' by Clifford L.

For the most part, these were not the top henchmen of the ancien régime; most had escaped before the rebels assumed control of the city and halted outgoing air and sea traffic, or remained holed up in embassies. Most of those left behind were deputies, or rank and file ''chivatos'' and police torturers. The trials began at eight or nine in the evening, and, more often than not, a verdict was reached by two or three in the morning. Duque de Estrada, whose job it was to gather evidence, take testimonies, and prepare the trials, also sat with Che, the "supreme prosecutor," on the appellate bench, where Che made the final decision on the men's fate."

==Family heritage and early life==
[[Image:childche.jpg|left|thumb|Guevara (center) with friends as a young child.]]Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Argentina]], the eldest of five children in a family of [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] descent; both his father and mother were of [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry.{{cref|Basque}} One of Guevara's forebears, Patrick Lynch, was born in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]], in 1715.{{cref|Galway}} He left for [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]], and traveled from there to Argentina. Francisco Lynch (Guevara's great-grandfather) was born in 1817, and Ana Lynch (his grandmother) in 1868. Her son, Ernesto Guevara Lynch (Guevara's father) was born in 1900. Guevara Lynch married Celia de la Serna y Llosa in 1927 (one of her non-lineal ancestors was [[José de la Serna e Hinojosa]], Spanish [[viceroy of Peru]]), and they had three sons and two daughters. [[Image:Casa Che Guevara 1.jpg|right|thumb|Birthplace of Ernesto "Che" Guevara in Rosario. The building was erected by Enrique Ferrarese and designed by Arq. Bustillo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Media: Casa Che Guevara 3.jpg|<small>Another view.</small>]]]]Growing up in this [[leftism|leftist]]-leaning ''déclassé'' family of [[aristocratic]] lineage, Ernesto Guevara became known for his dynamic personality and radical perspective even as a boy. He idolized [[Francisco Pizarro]] and yearned to have been one of his soldiers.<ref>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 446. "At one time I wanted to be one of Pizarro's soldiers; but [to fulfill] my quest for adventures and my yearnings to overlook climatic moments, that isn't a necessity any longer; today it is all here, and with an ideal to fight for, together with the responsibility of leaving an example." -- excerpt from a December 1959 letter to his parents.</ref> Though suffering from the crippling bouts of [[asthma]] that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete. He was an avid [[rugby union]] player despite his handicap and earned himself the nickname "Fuser" &mdash; a contraction of "El Furibundo" ("The Raging") and his mother's surname, "Serna" &mdash; for his aggressive style of play. Ernesto was nicknamed "Chancho" ("pig") by his schoolmates because he rarely bathed, something he was rather proud of.<ref>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 28.</ref>[[Image:Chechicoburro.jpg|left|thumb|Guevara on a ''[[Donkey#Burro|burro]]'' at the age of 3.]]

Guevara learned [[chess]] from his father and began participating in local tournaments by the age of 12.<ref>Digital Granma Internacional, "Simultaneous chess game on 37th anniversary of Che’s death", [[13 October]] [[2004]]. [http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2004/octubre/mier13/42CHE.html Online at Granma International English Edition], accessed [[January 5]], [[2006]].</ref> During his adolescence, he became passionate about poetry, especially that of [[Pablo Neruda]]. Guevara, as is common practice among Latin Americans of his class, also wrote poems throughout his life. He was an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests ranging from adventure classics by [[Jack London]], [[Emilio Salgari]], and [[Jules Verne]] to essays on [[human sexuality|sexuality]] by [[Sigmund Freud]] and treatises on social philosophy by [[Bertrand Russell]]. In his late teens, he developed a keen interest in photography and spent many hours photographing people, places and, during later travels, [[archeology|archaeological]] sites.

In 1948  Guevara entered the [[University of Buenos Aires]] to study medicine. As a student, he spent long periods traveling around [[Latin America]]. In 1951 his older friend, [[Alberto Granado]], a [[biochemistry|biochemist]], suggested that Guevara take a year off from his medical studies to embark on a trip they had talked of making for years, traversing [[South America]]. Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from their hometown of [[Alta Gracia]] astride a 1939 [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]] 500&nbsp;cc [[motorcycle]] they named ''La Poderosa II''&nbsp; ("The Mighty One, the Second") with the idea of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo [[Leper colony]] in [[Peru]] on the banks of the [[Amazon River]]. Guevara narrated this journey in ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', which was translated into English in 1996 and used in 2004 as the basis for a [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|motion picture of the same name]], directed by [[Walter Salles]].

Witnessing the widespread poverty, oppression and disenfranchisement throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara decided that the only solution for the region’s inequalities was armed revolution. His travels and readings also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for liberation. His conception of a borderless, united [[Ibero-America]] sharing a common '[[mestizo]]' culture{{cref|Ibero-America}} was a theme that would prominently recur during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he expedited the completion of his medical studies, completed his education as a medic in order to resume his travels in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] and received his diploma on [[12 June]] [[1953]].{{cref|Diploma}}

==Guatemala==
On [[7 July]] [[1953]], Guevara set out on a trip through [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], and [[El Salvador]]. During the final days of December 1953 he arrived in [[Guatemala]] where  President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] headed the second fully democratic and modern government in the whole Latin-American region that, through [[land reform]] and other initiatives, was attempting to bring an end to the U.S.-dominated ''[[latifundia]]'' system. In a contemporaneous letter to his Aunt Beatriz, Guevara explained his motivation for settling down for a time in Guatemala: "In Guatemala", he wrote, "I will perfect myself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary."<ref>Guevara Lynch, Ernesto. ''Aquí va un soldado de América''. Barcelona: Plaza y Janés Editores, S.A., 2000,  p. 26. "En Guatemala me perfeccionaré y lograré lo que me falta para ser un revolucionario auténtico." This statement in a letter written in [[Costa Rica]] on [[10 December]] [[1953]] is important because it proves that, whereas many authors have asserted that Guevara became a revolutionary as a result of witnessing the US-sponsored coup against Arbenz, he had in fact already made the decision to become a revolutionary before arriving in Guatemala and indeed went there for that express purpose.</ref>[[Image:Che Guevara - 2do Viaje - 1953-55.png|thumb|250px|A map showing Che Guevara's movements between 1953 and 1956; including his trip north to Guatemala, his stay in Mexico and his journey east by boat to Cuba with [[Fidel Castro]] and other revolutionaries.]]

Shortly after reaching Guatemala City, Guevara acted upon the suggestion of a mutual friend that he seek out Hilda Gadea Acosta, a Peruvian economist who was living and working there. Gadea, whom he would later marry, was well-connected politically as a result of her membership in the socialist [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA) led by [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]], and she introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the Arbenz government. He also re-established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to [[Fidel Castro]] whom he had initially met in Costa Rica; among them was Antonio "Ñico" López, associated with the attack on the "Carlos Manuel de Céspedes" barracks in [[Bayamo]] in the Cuban province of Oriente,<ref>Radio Cadena Agramonte, "Ataque al cuartel del Bayamo" [http://www.cadenagramonte.cubaweb.cu/historia/cuartel_bayamo.asp Online], accessed [[February 25]] [[2006]].</ref> and who would die at Ojo del Toro bridge soon after the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' landed in Cuba.<ref>Granma.cu, "Walking towards sunrise" [http://www.granma.cu/ingles/noviem4/48bermudez-i.html Online], accessed [[February 25]] [[2006]].</ref> Guevara joined these "[[Moncada Barracks|moncadistas]]" in the sale of religious objects related to the [[Christ#Race of Christ|Black Christ]] of [[Esquipulas]], and he also assisted two Venezuelan [[malaria]] specialists at a local hospital. It was during this period that he acquired his famous nickname, "Che", due to his frequent use of the Argentine [[interjection]] [[Che (Spanish)|''Che'']] ({{pronounced|tʃe}}), which is used in much the same way as "hey", "pal", "[[eh]]", or "mate" are employed colloquially in various English-speaking countries. [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], and southern [[Brazil]] (where the interjection is rendered 'tchê' in written Portuguese) are the only areas where this [[expression]] is used, making it a trademark of the [[Río de la Plata|Rioplatense]] region.

Guevara's attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious, leading him to pawn some of Hilda's jewelry.<ref name=jewelry> Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 139–141</ref> He maintained a distance from any political organization, even though his political thinking at that time manifested a clear sympathy towards communism. Despite Guevara’s financial woes, he rejected an offer to work as a state medic when it transpired that he would have to affiliate himself with the [[Guatemalan Party of Labour|Communist Party of Guatemala]].<ref name=jewelry /> Political events in the country began to move quickly after [[May 15]], [[1954]] when a shipment of [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] infantry and light artillery weapons sent from [[Communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]] for the Arbenz Government arrived in [[Puerto Barrios]] aboard the [[Sweden|Swedish]] ship ''[[Alfhem]]''. The amount of Czechoslovak weaponry was estimated to be 2000 tons by the CIA<ref name=usdepstate>U.S. Department of State, "Foreign Relations, Guatemala, 1952–1954". [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/ike/guat/20179.htm Online], accessed [[March 4]] [[2006]].</ref> though only 2 tons by Jon Lee Anderson.<ref>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 144</ref>

Guevara briefly left Guatemala for El Salvador to pick up a new visa, then returned to Guatemala only a few days before the CIA-sponsored coup attempt led by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] began.<ref name=usdepstate /> The anti-Arbenz forces tried, but failed, to stop the trans-shipment of the Czechoslovak weapons by train. However, after pausing to regroup and recover energy, Castillo Armas' column seized the initiative and, apparently with the assistance of US air support, started to gain ground.<ref>Holland, Max. "Private Sources of U.S. Foreign Policy: William Pawley and the 1954 Coup d'Etat in Guatemala", ''Journal of Cold War Studies'', Volume 7, Number 4, Fall 2005, pp. 36–73</ref> Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed [[militia]] organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose; but, frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight but his efforts were thwarted when Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. After Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine [[consulate]] where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later. At that point, he turned down a free seat on a flight back to Argentina that was offered to him by the embassy, preferring instead to make his way to [[Mexico]].

The overthrow of the Arbenz regime by a [[Operation PBSUCCESS|coup d'état backed by the Central Intelligence Agency]] cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an [[imperialism|imperialist]] power that would implacably oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. This strengthened his conviction that socialism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions.

Several weeks later, [[Fidel Castro]] arrived in Mexico City after having been amnestied from prison in Cuba, and on the evening of [[8 July]], [[1955]], Raúl introduced Guevara to the older Castro brother. During a fervid overnight conversation, Guevara became convinced that Fidel was the inspirational revolutionary leader for whom he had been searching, and he immediately joined the "[[26th of July Movement]]" that intended to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Although it was planned that he would be the group's medic, Guevara participated in the military training alongside the other members of the 26J Movement, and at the end of the course, was singled out by their instructor, Col.

When the cabin cruiser ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' set out from [[Tuxpan]], [[Veracruz]] for Cuba on [[November 25]], [[1956]], Guevara was one of only four non-Cubans aboard.{{cref|non-Cubans}} Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, about half of the expeditionaries were killed or executed upon capture. Guevara wrote that it was during this confrontation that he laid down his knapsack containing medical supplies in order to pick up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, a moment which he later recalled as marking his transition from physician to combatant.{{cref|Knapsack}} Only 15–20 rebels survived as a battered fighting force; they re-grouped and fled into the mountains of the [[Sierra Maestra]] to wage [[guerrilla warfare]] against the Batista regime.[[Image:Cuba - Santa Clara - stèle du Che.JPG|thumb|right|A Remembrance of [[Battle of Santa Clara|attack on Santa Clara]].]]

Guevara became a leader among the rebels, a ''Comandante'' (English translation: Major), respected by his comrades in arms for his courage and military prowess,<ref>U. S. Central Intelligence Agency, "CIA Biographic Register on Ernesto 'Che' Guevara". [http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/8702/cia.html Online], accessed [[July 12]], [[2006]].

Though wishing to push the battlefront forward and frustrated by his more stationary role, Guevara spent the period developing contacts with sympathetic locals.<ref>Anderson p. 317.</ref> He also conducted a brief relationship with eighteen-year-old Zoila Rodríguez, the daughter of a local ''guajiro''.<ref>[http://www.fenix.islagrande.cu/Noticias/Chetestimonio.htm ''Testimonio de Zoila Rodríguez García, novia de Ernesto Guevara en Sierra Maestra''; incluido en el libro ''Che entre nosotros''(1992), de Adys Cupull y Froilán González]</ref>

As the war extended throughout eastern Cuba, Guevara and a new column of fighters were dispatched west for the final push towards Havana. In the final days of December 1958, he directed his "suicide squad" (which undertook the most dangerous tasks in the rebel army)<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, "Suicide Squad: Example Of Revolutionary Morale (an excerpt from ''Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War - 1956-58'').

In this speech, given at the dedication of a publishing house and commemorating the 25th anniversary of the taking of [[Palma]], Castro discussed the importance to the revolution of the taking of Palma on the way to [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]].  He talked about the previous recent fighting at [[Guisa]], [[Baire]], [[Jiguani]], and in the Sierra Maestra and how as a result of revolutionary successes the Cuban army in Bayamo was unable to consolidate forces with its surrounding units. Castro went on to describe the strategic importance of the revolutionary position along the banks of the [[Cautillo River]] as a position from which the army at [[Bayamo]] could be contained while, on the other side, the army at Santiago could be targeted once Palma was taken and the revolutionary forces re-armed. With respect to the planned attack against Santiago, Castro said: ''We established our defensive line on the [[Cautillo River]]. We had Mapos surrounded, but there was still Palma. There were approximately 300 enemy soldiers. We had to take Palma. We were also anxious to take the arms that were to be found in Palma, because when we left [[La Plata]], in the Sierra Maestra, because of the latest offensive, we left with 25 armed soldiers and 1,000 unarmed recruits. We armed those troops along the way. We armed them during the fighting, but we really finished fully arming them in Palma.''

On [[February 7]], [[1959]], the government proclaimed Guevara "a Cuban citizen by birth" in recognition of his role in the triumph of the revolutionary forces. Shortly thereafter, he initiated divorce proceedings to put a formal end to his marriage with Gadea, from whom he had been separated since before leaving Mexico on the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]''. On [[June 2]], [[1959]], he married [[Aleida March]],{{cref|Children}} a Cuban-born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958.[[Image:Ergstimecover1960.jpg|thumb|left|TIME magazine, [[August 8]], [[1960]].]]

He was appointed commander of the [[La Cabaña Fortress]] prison, and during his five-month tenure in that post ([[January 2]] through [[June 12]], [[1959]]),<ref>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 372 and p. 425</ref> he oversaw the trial and execution of many people, among whom were former Batista regime officials and members of the "Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities" (BRAC), a unit of the secret police known by its Spanish acronym. José Vilasuso, an attorney who worked under Guevara at [[La Cabaña]] preparing indictments, said that these were lawless proceedings where "the facts were judged without any consideration to general juridical principles" and the findings were pre-determined by Guevara.<ref>"Executions at La Cabaña fortress under Ernesto "Ché" Guevara".

In this document, Vilasuso (who, along with most of the other legally-trained participants, quit due to its excesses) described the La Cabaña tribunal as the “Purging Commission”.  He described a process where “[t]he statements of the investigating officer constituted irrefutable proof of wrongdoing” and where "[t]here were relatives of victims of the previous regime who were put in charge of judging the accused." He also provided vivid recollections of the final hours of the condemned with their family and friends, and he gave a graphic description of the execution details.  He recalled that Guevara "chastised us all: 'Don’t delay these trials. This is a revolution, the proofs are secondary. We have to proceed by conviction. They are a gang of criminals and murderers. Besides, remember that there is an Appeals Tribunals [sic]'." But the Appeals Tribunal, according to Vilasuso, "never decided in favor of the appeal. It simply confirmed the sentences.

Later, Guevara became an official at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform,{{cref|INRA}} and President of the National Bank of Cuba.{{cref|BNC}} He signed all [http://www.banknotes.com/CU88.JPG Cuban banknotes] issued during his fourteen-month presidency with his nickname, "Che".{{cref|Signature}} Throughout his time in the Cuban government, Guevara refused his due salaries of office, insisting on drawing only his meager wages as army ''commandante'' in order to set a "revolutionary example".<ref name=anderson>Anderson, Jon Lee.

During this time his fondness for [[chess]] was rekindled, and he attended and participated in most national and international tournaments held in Cuba.<ref>chessgames.com, "[[Miguel Najdorf]] vs Ernesto Che Guevara".

Even as early as 1959, Guevara helped organize revolutionary expeditions overseas, all of which failed. The first attempt was made in [[Panama]]; another in the [[Dominican Republic]] (led by Henry Fuerte,<ref>Puerto Padre website, "Cronologia" (List of anniversaries)

In 1960 Guevara provided first aid to victims when the freighter ''[[La Coubre explosion|La Coubre]]'', a French vessel carrying munitions from the port of Antwerp, exploded while it was being unloaded in Havana harbor. A rescue operation immediately ensued but went awry when a second explosion occurred, resulting in well over a hundred dead.<ref>Cuban Information Archives, "La Coubre explodes in Havana 1960."

Guevara later served as Minister of Industries,{{cref|MININD}} in which post he helped formulate Cuban [[socialism]], and became one of the country's most prominent figures. In his book ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'', he advocated replicating the Cuban model of revolution initiated by a small group (''[[foco]]'') of guerrillas without the need for broad organizations to precede armed insurrection. His essay ''El socialismo y el hombre en Cuba'' (1965) (''Man and Socialism in Cuba'') advocates the need to shape a "new man" (''hombre nuevo'') in conjunction with a socialist state. Some saw Guevara as the simultaneously glamorous and austere model of that "new man."

During the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], Guevara did not participate in the fighting, having been ordered by Castro to a command post in Cuba's westernmost [[Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río province]] where he was involved in fending off a decoy force. He did, however, suffer a bullet wound to the face during this deployment, which he said had been caused by the accidental discharge of his own gun.<ref name=anderson2>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', ISBN 0-8021-1600-0, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 508.</ref>

Guevara played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed [[ballistic missile]]s that precipitated the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962. During an interview with the British newspaper ''[[Daily Worker]]'' some weeks later, he stated that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them against major U.S. cities.<ref name=anderson3>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', ISBN 0-8021-1600-0, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 545: "In an interview with Che a few weeks after the crisis, Sam Russell, a British correspondent for the socialist [[The Morning Star|Daily Worker]], found Guevara still fuming over the Soviet betrayal. Alternately puffing on a cigar and taking blasts from an inhaler, Guevara told Russell that if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off. Russell came away with mixed feelings about Che, calling him 'a warm character whom I took to immediately... clearly a man of great intelligence though I thought he was crackers from the way he went on about the missiles.'"</ref>

==Disappearance from Cuba==

''Che in Africa: Che Guevara's Congo Diary''. Melbourne: Ocean Press, 1999, p. 28.</ref> On [[17 December]], he flew to [[Paris]] and from there embarked on a three-month international tour during which he visited the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[United Arab Republic]] ([[Egypt]]), [[Algeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Benin|Dahomey]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], and [[Tanzania]], with stops in [[Ireland]], [[Paris]], and [[Prague]]. He also visited [[Pyongyang]] and told the press that [[North Korea]] was a model to which revolutionary Cuba should aspire.<ref>Bruce Cumings, "Korea’s Place in the Sun: A Modern History", updated edition, W.W. Norton & Company, 2005, p. 404.</ref>

In [[Algiers]] on [[24 February]], [[1965]], he made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech to the "Second Economic Seminar on Afro-Asian Solidarity" in which he declared, "There are no frontiers in this struggle to the death. We cannot remain indifferent in the face of what occurs in any part of the world. A victory for any country against imperialism is our victory, just as any country's defeat is our defeat."<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, (editors Rolando E. Bonachea and Nelson P.

He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries should implement in order to accomplish this objective.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, (editors Rolando E. Bonachea and Nelson P. Valdés), ''Che: Selected Works of Ernesto Guevara'', Cambridge, MA: 1969, pp. 352-59.</ref><ref name=algiers /> He returned to Cuba on [[14 March]] to a solemn reception by Fidel and Raúl Castro, [[Osvaldo Dorticós]] and Carlos Rafael Rodríguez at the Havana airport.

Two weeks later, Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether. His whereabouts were the great mystery of 1965 in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the relative failure of the [[industrialization]] scheme he had advocated while minister of industry, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara's pro-[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] bent as the [[Sino-Soviet split]] grew more pronounced, and to serious differences between Guevara and the Cuban leadership regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line.<ref>Guevara, Ernesto Che. ''The Great Debate on Political Economy'', New York: 2006, Ocean Press, 430 pages (entire book is devoted to this subject).</ref>

Following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and what he perceived as a Soviet betrayal of Cuba when [[Khrushchev]] agreed to withdraw the missiles from Cuban territory without consulting Castro, Guevara had grown increasingly skeptical of the Soviet Union. As revealed in his last speech in Algiers, he had come to view the [[Northern Hemisphere]], led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. He strongly supported [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] [[North Vietnam]] and the [[Viet Cong]] in the [[Vietnam War]], and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create "100 Vietnams".<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, "English Translation of Complete Text of his ''Message to the Tricontinental''", or see [[s:es:Mensaje a los Pueblos del Mundo|Original Spanish text at Wikisource]].</ref>[[Image:Che-airport-14mar65.jpg|thumb|left|Guevara with members of his "reception committee" at Havana airport<br /><small>([[Havana]] - [[14 March]] [[1965]]).</small>]]

Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on [[16 June]], [[1965]], that the people would be informed about Guevara when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Numerous rumors about his disappearance spread both inside and outside Cuba. On [[3 October]] of that year, Castro revealed a hand written undated letter<ref name=farewell>Ernesto Che Guevara, "Che Guevara's Farewell Letter", 1965. English translation of complete text: [[s:Che Guevara's Farewell Letter|Che Guevara's Farewell Letter at Wikisource]].</ref> purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier in which Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight abroad for the cause of the revolution. He explained that "Other nations of the world summon my modest efforts," and that he had therefore decided to go and fight as a guerrilla "on new battlefields". In the letter Guevara announced his resignation from all his positions in the government, in the party, and in the Army, and renounced his Cuban citizenship, which had been granted to him in 1959 in recognition of his efforts on behalf of the revolution.

During an interview with four foreign correspondents on [[1 November]], Castro remarked that he knew where Guevara was but would not disclose his location, and added, denying reports that his former comrade-in-arms was dead, that "he is in the best of health." Despite Castro's assurances, Guevara's fate remained a mystery at the end of 1965 and his movements and whereabouts continued to be a closely held secret for the next two years.

The Cuban operation was to be carried out in support of the pro-[[Patrice Lumumba]] Marxist Simba movement in the Congo-Kinshasa (formerly [[Belgian Congo]], later [[Zaire]] and currently the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Guevara, his second-in-command [[Victor Dreke]], and twelve of the Cuban expeditionaries arrived in the Congo on [[24 April]] [[1965]]; a contingent of approximately 100 [[Afro-Cuban]]s joined them soon afterwards.<ref>Gálvez, William.

Although Guevara was thirty-seven at the time and had no formal military training, he had the experiences of the Cuban revolution, including his successful march on Santa Clara, which was central to Batista finally being overthrown by Castro's forces. His asthma had prevented him from being drafted into military service in Argentina, a fact of which he was proud given his opposition to [[Juan Perón|Perón's]] government.

South African mercenaries including [[Mike Hoare]] and [[Cuba]]n exiles worked with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] army to thwart Guevara. They were able to monitor his communications, arrange to ambush the rebels and the Cubans whenever they attempted to attack, and interdict his supply lines.<ref>African History Blog, "Che Guevara's Exploits in the Congo", [http://africanhistory.about.com/b/a/227091.htm Che Guevara's Exploits in the Congo Online at African History], accessed [[January 5]] [[2006]].</ref><ref>Mad Mike Hoare Site, "Mad Mike".

Guevara's aim was to export the Cuban Revolution by instructing local Simba fighters in communist ideology and [[foco]] strategies of [[guerrilla warfare]]. In his ''Congo Diary'', he cites the incompetence, intransigence, and infighting of the local Congolese forces as the key reasons for the revolt's failure.<ref>Ireland's Own, "From Cuba to Congo, Dream to Disaster for Che Guevara". [http://irelandsown.net/Che2.html Online at irelandsown.net], accessed [[January 11]] [[2006]].</ref> Later that same year, ill with dysentery, suffering from his asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors (six members of his column had died). At one point Guevara had considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, then standing alone and fighting until the end in the Congo as a revolutionary example; however, after being urged by his comrades in arms and pressured by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave the Congo. A few weeks later, when writing the preface to the diary he had kept during the Congo venture, he began it with the words: "This is the history of a failure."<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, translated from the Spanish by Patrick Camiller, ''The African Dream'', New York: Grove Publishers, 2000, p.1.</ref>

===Interlude===
Because Castro had made public Guevara's "farewell letter"<ref name=farewell /> to him &mdash; a letter Guevara had intended should only be revealed in case of his death &mdash; wherein he had written that he was severing all ties to Cuba in order to devote himself to revolutionary activities in other parts of the world, he felt that he could not return to Cuba with the other surviving combatants for moral reasons, and he spent the next six months living clandestinely in [[Dar-es-Salaam]], and [[Prague]]. During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience, and wrote the drafts of two more books, one on philosophy<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, ''Apuntes Filosóficos'', draft.</ref> and the other on economics.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, ''Notas Económicas'', draft.</ref> He also visited several countries in Western Europe in order to "test" a new false identity and the corresponding documentation (passport, etc.) created for him by [[DGI|Cuban Intelligence]] that he planned to use to travel to South America. Throughout this period Castro continued to importune him to return to Cuba, but Guevara only agreed to do so when it was understood that he would be there on a strictly temporary basis for the few months needed to prepare a new revolutionary effort somewhere in Latin America, and that his presence on the island would be cloaked in the tightest secrecy.

==Bolivia==
===Insurgent===
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Chebol4jpg.jpg|thumb|right|310px| Che in Bolivia.]] -->[[Image:Vallegrande location.png|thumb|right|Map of Bolivia showing location of [[Vallegrande]].]]
Speculation on Guevara's whereabouts continued throughout 1966 and into 1967. Representatives of the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] independence movement [[FRELIMO]] reported meeting with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in [[Dar es Salaam]], at which point they rejected his offer of aid in their revolutionary project.<ref>Mittleman, James H. ''Underdevelopment and the Transition to Socialism - Mozambique and Tanzania'', New York: 1981, Academic Press, p. 38.</ref> In a speech at the 1967 [[May Day]] rally in Havana, the Acting Minister of the armed forces, Major [[Juan Almeida]], announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America". The persistent reports that he was leading the guerrillas in Bolivia were eventually shown to be true.

At Castro's behest, a 3,700 acre parcel of jungle land in the remote Ñancahuazú region had been purchased by native Bolivian Communists for Guevara to use as a training area and base camp.{{cref|Camp}} The evidence suggests that the training at this camp in the Ñancahuazú valley was more hazardous than combat to Guevara and the Cubans accompanying him. Little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army. Former [[Stasi]] operative [[Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider]], better known by her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Tania", who had been installed as his primary agent in La Paz, was reportedly also working for the [[KGB]] and is widely inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara's trail.<ref>Major Donald R. Selvage - USMC, "Che Guevara in Bolivia", [[1 April]] [[1985]]. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SDR.htm Online at GlobalSecurity.org], accessed [[January 5]] [[2006]].</ref> The numerous photographs taken by and of Guevara and other members of his guerrilla group that they left behind at their base camp after the initial clash with the Bolivian army in March 1967 provided President [[René Barrientos]] with the first proof of his presence in Bolivia; after viewing them, Barrientos allegedly stated that he wanted Guevara's head displayed on a pike in downtown [[La Paz]]. He thereupon ordered the Bolivian Army to hunt Guevara and his followers down.

Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50 and operating as the ELN (''Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia''; English: "[[National Liberation Army of Bolivia]]"), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region. In September, however, the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups, reportedly killing one of the leaders.

Despite the violent nature of the conflict, Guevara gave medical attention to all of the wounded Bolivian soldiers whom the guerrillas took prisoner, and subsequently released them. Even after his last battle at the Quebrada del Yuro, in which he had been wounded, when he was taken to a temporary holding location and saw there a number of Bolivian soldiers who had also been wounded in the fighting, he offered to give them medical care. His offer was turned down by the Bolivian officer in charge.<ref>Taibo, Paco Ignacio II. ''Ernesto Guevara, también conocido como el Che'', Barcelona, 1999: Editorial Planeta, p 726.</ref>

Guevara's plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia appears to have been based upon a number of misconceptions:
*He had expected to deal only with the country's military government and its poorly trained and equipped army. However, after the U.S. government learned of his location, CIA and other operatives were sent into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The Bolivian Army was being trained and supplied by [[U.S. Army Special Forces]]{{cref|USMilitary}} advisors, including a recently organized elite battalion of [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] trained in [[jungle warfare]] that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the guerrillas' zone of operations.<ref>U.S. Army, "[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/che14_1.htm Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Activation, Organization and Training of the 2d Ranger Battalion – Bolivian Army ([[28 April]] [[1967]])]". Accessed [[June 19]] [[2006]].</ref><ref>Ryan, Henry Butterfield. '' The Fall of Che Guevara : A Story of Soldiers, Spies, and Diplomats'', New York, 1998: Oxford University Press, p 82–102, inter alia.</ref>
*Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents. He did not receive it; and Bolivia's Communist Party, under the leadership of [[Mario Monje]], was oriented towards Moscow rather than Havana and did not aid him, despite having promised to do so. Some members of the Bolivian Communist Party did join/support him, such as Coco and Inti Peredo, Rodolfo Saldaña, Serapio Aquino Tudela, and Antonio Jiménez Tardio, against the Party leadership's wishes.
*He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. However, the two shortwave transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty, so that the guerrillas were unable to communicate with Havana. In this, and in many other respects, [[Manuel Piñeiro]], the man to whom Castro had assigned the task of coordinating support for Guevara's operations in Bolivia, performed abysmally. To further complicate matters, some months into the campaign, the tape recorder that the guerrillas used to record and decipher the [[one-time pad]]-encoded radio messages sent to them from Havana was lost while crossing a river, making de-coding such messages more difficult.{{cref|Message}}

In addition, his penchant for confrontation rather than compromise appears to have contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, "Excerpt from ''Pasajes de la guerra revolucionaria: Congo''", [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&fuseaction=va2.document&identifier=5034C64B-96B6-175C-97A3C636C37896FB&sort=Collection&item=The%20Cold%20War%20in%20Africa Online at Cold War International History Project], accessed [[April 26]] [[2006]].</ref> This tendency had surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba as well, but had been kept in check there by the timely interventions and guidance of Castro.<ref>Castañeda, Jorge G.

===Capture and execution===

[[Image:Escuela de la higuera 01.jpg|thumb|The schoolhouse in [[La Higuera]] where Che Guevara was executed at 1:10 p.m. on [[9 October]] [[1967]].]]The hunt for Guevara in Bolivia was headed by [[Félix Rodríguez (Central Intelligence Agency)|Félix Rodríguez]], a [[CIA]] agent, who previously had infiltrated Cuba to prepare contacts with the rebels in the [[Escambray Mountains]] and the anti-Castro underground in [[Havana]] prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion, and had been successfully extracted from Cuba afterwards.<ref>Rodriguez, Felix I. and John Weisman.

On [[8 October]], the encampment was encircled, and Guevara was captured while leading a detachment with [[Simeón Cuba Sarabia]] in the Quebrada del Yuro ravine. According to some soldiers present at the capture, during the skirmish as they approached Guevara, he allegedly shouted, "Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead."<ref name=anderson4>Anderson, Jon Lee. Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p.733. "When they were a few feet away, a short, sturdy highland Indian named Sergent Bernardino Huanca broke through the bush and pointed his gun at them. He later claimed Che had told him, "Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead."</ref> Upon hearing of Guevara's capture, Rodríguez relayed the information to CIA headquarters at [[Langley, Virginia]], via CIA stations in various South American nations.

Barrientos promptly ordered his execution upon being informed of his capture.{{cref|Barrientos}} Guevara was taken to a dilapidated schoolhouse in the nearby village of [[La Higuera]] where he was held overnight. Early the next afternoon he was executed. The executioner was [[Mario Terán]], a Sergeant in the Bolivian army who had drawn a short straw after arguments over who got the honor of killing Guevara broke out among the soldiers. To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the official story sold to the public, Felix Rodriguez, the CIA asset, ordered the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully to make it appear that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army, and thus to help cover up the official secret assassination.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7027619.stm CIA man recounts Che Guevara's death]", BBC News, [[October 8]], [[2007]].</ref> Guevara received multiple shots to the legs, so as to avoid maiming his face for identification purposes and simulate combat wounds in an attempt to conceal his extrajudicial execution.

Che Guevara had some [[last words]] before his death; he allegedly said to his executioner, "I know you are here to kill me. Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man". Another alleged comment was "Do you know Who I am? Do you know what I'm worth?"<ref name=anderson5>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life''. New York: Grove Press, 1997.</ref> His body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to neighboring [[Vallegrande]] where it was laid out on a laundry tub in the local hospital and displayed to the press.<ref>[[Richard Gott]], "Bolivia on the Day of the Death of Che Guevara". [http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm Online at Mindfully.org], accessed [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref>

After the execution, Rodríguez took several personal items of Guevara's including a [[Rolex]] watch, often proudly showing them to reporters during the ensuing years. Today, some of these belongings, including his flashlight, are on display at the CIA.<ref>National Security Archive. Electronic Briefing Book No. 5 [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/index.html Online], accessed [[March 25]] [[2007]].</ref> After a military doctor surgically amputated his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara's cadaver to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated.{{cref|Amputation}}

On [[October 15]], Castro acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout Cuba. The death of Guevara was regarded as a severe blow to the socialist revolutionary movements in Latin America and the rest of the [[third world]].

===''The Bolivian Diary''===
Also removed when Guevara was captured was his diary, which documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, ''"Diario (Bolivia)"''. [http://www.uco.es/~i62guigm/che/diario.htm Online], accessed [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref> The first entry is on [[November 7]] [[1966]] shortly after his arrival at the farm in Ñancahuazú, and the last entry is on [[October 7]] [[1967]], the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely due to discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to reestablish contact, and describes their overall failure. It records the rift between Guevara and the Bolivian Communist Party that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally anticipated. It shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, due in part to the fact that the guerrilla group had learned [[Quechua]] rather than the local language which was [[Tupí-Guaraní]]. As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.

The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine and circulated around the world. There are at least four additional diaries in existence &mdash; those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias "Braulio"), Harry Villegas Tamayo ("Pombo"), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez ("Rolando")<ref>Major Donald R.

While pictures of Guevara's dead body were being circulated and the circumstances of his death debated, his legend began to spread.

====Legacy in Cuba====
[[Image:Che relief on MININD building.jpg|thumb|right|Monumental image on [[Cuba]]n Ministry of the Interior, based on [[Ireland|Irish]] [[artist]] [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick]]'s graphic of [[Alberto Korda]]'s [[Che Guevara (photo)|March 1960 photo]]. During Guevara's tenure as [[Media:Cheministro.png|Minister]] of the Ministry of Industries (MININD) from 1961 to 1965, this building was the MININD's headquarters and his office was on the top floor.]]In Cuba, Guevara's death precipitated the abandonment of guerrilla warfare as an instrument of foreign policy, ushering in a ''rapprochement'' with the [[Soviet Union]], and the reformation of the government along Soviet lines. When Cuban troops returned to Africa in the 1970s, it was as part of a large-scale military expedition, and support for insurrection movements in Latin America and the Caribbean became logistical and organizational rather than overt. Cuba also abandoned Guevara's plans for economic diversification and rapid industrialization which had ultimately proved to be impracticable in view of the country's incorporation into the [[COMECON]] system. As early as 1965, the Yugoslav communist journal [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]] observed the many half-completed or empty factories in Cuba, a legacy of Guevara's tenure as Minister of Industries, "standing like sad memories of the conflict between pretension and reality".<ref>Hugh Thomas. Cuba : The pursuit of freedom p. 1007.</ref>

The Cuban state continued to cultivate Guevara’s [[cult of personality]], constructing numerous statues and artworks in his honor throughout the land; adorning school rooms, workplaces, public buildings, billboards, and money with his image.<ref>"Cuba's face". Stanford University Germanic Collections.[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/german/exhibit/GDRposters/che.html Online]. Accessed [[October 24]] [[2006]].</ref> Children across the country begin each school day with the chant "''¡Pioneros por el Comunismo, Seremos como el Che!''" (English: Pioneers for Communism, We will be like Che!). Guevara's mausoleum in [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] has become a site of almost religious significance to many Cubans,<ref name=myth /> while the nation’s burgeoning [[Tourism in Cuba|tourist industry]] has benefited greatly from the ongoing international interest in Guevara's life. Some 205,832 people visited the mausoleum during 2004, of whom 127,597 were foreigners.

====Legacy in Cuban-American Community====
Reverence among Cubans for Guevara's memory is by no means universal. Many [[Cuban exiles]] have spoken of Guevara in less than favorable terms, and he is remembered by some as the "The Butcher of [[La Cabaña Fortress|la Cabaña]]", a reference to Guevara’s post-revolutionary role as “supreme prosecutor” at the Cabaña fortress. The epithet was repeated by Cuban-born musician [[Paquito D'Rivera]], who wrote an open letter castigating fellow musician [[Carlos Santana]], for wearing a T-shirt displaying Guevara’s image to the 2005 [[Academy Awards]] ceremony.<ref>[[Paquito D'Rivera]], "Open letter to Carlos Santana by Paquito D'Rivera in Latin Beat Magazine", [[25 March]] [[2005]].

:During his youthful travels, Guevara carried a minimal amount of money and tried to spend it only on food.  While making their 1952 trip, he and Alberto Granado received along the way several "collections" given to them by local people and/or other travellers who were concerned about their apparent destitution.

The origin and meaning of the place name are uncertain; it is recorded in the form Gebala by the geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century ad. This is a rare name in Spain." ''Dictionary of American Family Names'', Patrick Hanks, ed., London: 2003, Oxford University Press.  His mother, Celia de la Serna, had also inherited Basque blood through her father, Juan Martín de la Serna Ugalde. One of Celia's collateral ancestors was the last Viceroy of Perú, [[José de la Serna e Hinojosa|General José de la Serna e Hinojosa]], who was likewise of documented Basque origin.<ref>http://urumelb.tripod.com/che/biografia-del-che-guevara.htm</ref><ref>For detailed genealogical information about Che Guevara, including his family tree, see [http://en.rodovid.org/wk/Person:24256 Genealogy of Ernesto Guevara de la Serna]</ref>}}

*{{cnote|Galway|The Lynch family was one of the famous 14 Tribes of Galway. The misconception exists that Ana María Isabel Lynch was born in Ireland, whereas she was actually born (1868) in San Francisco, California, USA where her father, Francisco Lynch, had traveled from Argentina during the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] years.  Francisco had married a young Californian widow, Eloísa Ortiz, ca. 1860 and they had several other American-born children in addition to Ana Isabel. The man Ana Isabel would eventually marry, Roberto Guevara Castro, had also been born in California, USA of an Argentine father and a Californian mother who was the grand-daughter of the Spanish aristocrat Don [[Luís María Peralta]] who had been given large land grants (including 44,800 acres encompassing the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] region of California) by the King of Spain. Despite the fact that they were both born in the [[Bay area]] of California, Ana Isabel and Roberto did not meet until after their respective families had returned to Argentina in the 1880s. During Che's childhood, listening to his Grandmother Ana Isabel's tales of frontier life in California was one of his greatest delights.}}

*{{cnote|Ibero-America|In a brief speech at the San Pablo leprosarium in Peru on the occasion of his 24th birthday, Guevara said: "Although we're too insignificant to be spokesmen for such a noble cause, we believe, and this journey has only served to confirm this belief, that the division of America into unstable and illusory nations is a complete fiction. We are one single [[mestizo]] race with remarkable ethnographical similarities, from Mexico down to the Magellan Straits.

Cuba responded by sending a contingent of Cuban officers and troops totalling 686 men and some 60 tanks to support the Algerian forces. Shortly after news of the landing of the Cuban troops at [[Oran]] leaked to the press, King [[Hassan II of Morocco]] agreed to sign a cease-fire with President [[Ben Bella]] of Algeria. The Cuban expeditionary force remained in Algeria for six months, during which time they set up the military equipment they had brought and trained their Algerian counterparts in its use. Guevara played a major role in organizing and executing the Cuban deployment.<ref>Piero Gliejeses, "Cuba's First Venture in Africa: Algeria, 1961&ndash;1965", ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', no. 28, London: Cambridge University Press, Spring 1996, p. 188</ref><ref>Castañeda, pp. 244–245.</ref>}}

*{{cnote|NSA|"The intercept operators knew that Dar-es-Salaam was serving as a communications center for the fighters, receiving messages from Castro in Cuba and relaying them on to the guerrillas deep in the bush.  Guevara transmitted his progress reports and requests for supplies back through that same channel.

*{{cnote|Camp|The purchase of the acreage in the Ñancahuazú region was in direct contravention of Guevara's directive that the land for the camp should be purchased in the Alto Beni region. When presented with the ''fait accompli'' that the Bolivian Communists had acquired land in the Ñancahuazú region instead, he at first complained but eventually decided to utilize it in order not to lose time while waiting for them to purchase a parcel in the Alto Beni.}}

The advisors arrived on April 29 and instituted a 19 week counter-insurgency training program for the Bolivian 2nd Ranger Battalion. The intensive course included training in weapons, individual combat, squad and platoon tactics, patrolling, and counter-insurgency. The Bolivians responded well to the training and quickly developed into a spirited, confident, and effective counter guerrilla unit."<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SDR.htm ''Che Guevara in Bolivia''] by Major Donald R.

The content of this message has not been revealed, but it may have been of critical importance since by then Castro and the other Cubans who were directing the guerrillas' support network from Havana had to be aware of their dire straits.}}

*{{cnote|Barrientos|Although Barrientos never revealed his motives for ordering the summary execution of Guevara, some of his associates have suggested that he took this decision primarily in order to avoid the spectacle of a "show trial" that would have brought unwelcome international attention to Bolivia, and that he was also concerned that, had Guevara been sentenced to a lengthy term in a Bolivian prison, he might have escaped or eventually been released (as in Fidel Castro's case), and subsequently resumed his guerrilla activities.}}
