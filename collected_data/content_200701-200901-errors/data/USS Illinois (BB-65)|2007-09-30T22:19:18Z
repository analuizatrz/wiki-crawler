'''USS ''Illinois'' (BB-65)''' was scheduled to be an [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class battleship]] in the [[United States Navy]]. She was canceled prior to completion and scrapped.

The keel of ''Illinois'' was laid at [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] on [[15 January]] [[1945]]. Construction was canceled on [[12 August]] [[1945]] when the [[battleship]] was about 22 percent complete. Nothing was done with ''Illinois'' after cancellation, and the incomplete hulk was sold for scrapping in September 1958.<ref>Naval Institute Press. (December 1985). U.S. Battleships: An Illustrated Design History. ISBN 0-87021-715-1.</ref>

''Illinois'' differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all welded construction. This would have saved weight and increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull of the type used on the four completed ''Iowa''-class ships. There was thought of redesigning the hull with a torpedo protection system similar to that planned for the [[Montana class battleship|''Montana''-class]]; however, this was rejected and ''Illinois'' was being built along the regular ''Iowa''-class hull design.<ref name="incomplete">{{cite web |url=http://www.voodoo.cz/battleships/usa/iowa.html |title=USA - IOWA class |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>

It currently resides at [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], and is rung by members of the [[NROTC]] after the [[Fighting Illini]] football team scores.  It reads "USS Illinois 1946".

==In fiction==  	 
''Illinois'' appears in [[Asuka Strikes!|episode 8]] of the [[anime]] series [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]].  In the timeline of the series, the ship is completed and remains in service until being [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Gaghiel|destroyed]] in 2015.[[:Image:NGE Iowas.png|<sup>[2]</sup>]]
