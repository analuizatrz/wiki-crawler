'''Yoga''' ([[Sanskrit]]: योग ''Yoga'', {{IPA2|joːgə}}) is a group of ancient spiritual practices originating in [[India]]. As a general term in [[Hinduism]]<ref> Note: Definition given by Gavin Flood, Academic Director of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies [http://www.ochs.org.uk/news/10082005.html ochs.org.uk] </ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2007}} it has been defined as referring to "technologies or disciplines of [[asceticism]] and [[meditation]] which are thought to lead to spiritual experience and profound understanding or insight into the nature of existence."<ref>Flood (1996), p. 94.</ref> Yoga is also intimately connected to the religious beliefs and practices of the other [[Indian religions]].

Outside India, Yoga is mostly associated with the practice of [[asanas]] (postures) of [[Hatha Yoga]] or as a [[Yoga as exercise|form of exercise]], although it has influenced the entire [[Indian religions]] family and other spiritual practices throughout the world.<ref name=Knitter/> 

[[Hindu texts]] discussing different aspects of yoga include the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], the [[Shiva Samhita]], and many others.<ref name=Knitter>Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 13)</ref><ref>Qigong: Essence of the Healing Dance - Page 268 by Garri Garripoli</ref> 

Major branches of Yoga include: [[Hatha Yoga]], [[Karma Yoga]], [[Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti Yoga]], and [[Raja Yoga]].<ref name=yogaTrads1_042007>Pandit Usharbudh Arya (1985).

==Etymology==
The [[Sanskrit]] term ''yoga'' has a wide range of different meanings.<ref>For a list of 38 different meanings of the word "yoga" see: Apte, p. 788.</ref> It is derived from the Sanskrit root ''yuj'', "to control", "to yoke", or "to unite".<ref>For "yoga" as derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj" with meanings of "to control", "to yoke, or "to unite" see: Flood (1996), p. 94.</ref> Common meanings include "joining" or "uniting", and related ideas such as "union" and "conjunction".<ref>For meaning 1. joining, uniting, and 2., union, junction, combination see: Apte, p. 788.</ref>  Another conceptual definition is that of "mode, manner, means"<ref>For "mode, manner, means", see: Apte, p. 788, definition 5.</ref> or "expedient, means in general".<ref>For "expedient, means in general", see: Apte, p. 788, definition 13.</ref>

==History of Yoga==
===Indus Valley seals===
[[Image:Pashupati.gif|thumb|200px|right|A seal from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], showing a figure in meditation posture.]]

Several seals discovered at [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 3300–1700 BC) sites depict figures in a yoga or meditation like posture. There is considerable evidence to support the idea that the images show "a form of ritual discipline, suggesting a precursor of yoga"<ref>Possehl (2003), p. 144</ref> according to archaeologist [[Gregory Possehl]]. He points to sixteen other specific "yogi glyptics"<ref>Possehl (2003), p. 145</ref> in the corpus of Mature Harappan artifacts as pointing to Harappan devotion to "ritual discipline and concentration." These images show that the yoga pose "may have been used by deities and humans alike." Possehl suggests that yoga goes back to the Indus Valley Civilization.<ref>Possehl (2003), p. 144</ref>

The most widely known of these images was named the "[[Pashupati|Pashupati seal]]"<ref>Marshall, Sir John, ''Mohenjo Daro and the Indus Civilization'', London 1931</ref> by its discoverer, [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]], who believed that it represented a "proto-Shiva" figure.<ref>Flood (1996), pp. 28-29.</ref> Many modern authorities discount the idea that this "Pashupati" (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit ''{{IAST|paśupati}}'')<ref>For translation of ''{{IAST|paśupati}}'' as "Lord of Animals" see: Michaels, p. 312.</ref> represents a Shiva or Rudra figure.<ref>Keay, p. 14.</ref><ref>Possehl (2003), p. 143</ref> Gavin Flood also characterizes these views as "speculative", saying that it is not clear from the 'Pashupati' seal that the figure is seated in a yoga posture, or that the shape is intended to represent a human figure.<ref>Flood (1996), pp. 28-29.</ref><ref>Flood (2003), pp. 204-205.</ref> Authorities who support the idea that the 'Pashupati' figure shows a figure in a yoga or meditation posture include Archaeologist [[Jonathan Mark Kenoyer]], current Co-director of the Harappa Archaeological Research Project in Pakistan<ref>Kenoyer describes the figure as "seated in yogic position" with "the heels...pressed together under the groin." [http://www.harappa.com/indus/33.html ''Around the Indus in 90 Slides'' by Jonathan Mark Kenoyer]</ref><ref>[http://www.harappa.com/indus/induscopy.html ''Around the Indus in 90 Slides'' copyright information]</ref> and Indologist [[Heinrich Zimmer]].<ref>Zimmer describes the figure as "seated like a yogi." Zimmer, Heinrich, ''Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization''. Princeton University Press; New Ed edition (May 1, 1972). ISBN:978-0691017785</ref>

In 2007, terracotta seals were discovered in the [[Cholistan Desert]] in Pakistan. Punjab University Archaeology Department Chairman Dr. Farzand Masih described one of the seals as similar to the previously discovered Mohenjodaro seals, with three pictographs on one side and a "yogi" on the other side.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/2007/05/08/nat7.htm Malik, Mansoor ''Rare objects discovery points to ruins treasure'', Dawn newspaper, Pakistan, May 8, 2007.]</ref><ref>''Ruins identical to Mohenjodaro, Harappa possibly exist in Pakistan'', Malaysia Sun, May 8, 2007</ref>

===Literary sources===
{{See also|History of Yoga}}

Ascetic practices (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'') are referenced in the [[Brahmana|{{IAST|Brāhmaṇas}}]] (900 BCE and 500 BCE),<ref>Flood, p. 94.</ref> early commentaries on the vedas. In the Upanishads, an early reference to meditation is made in [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]],<ref>Flood, p. 94.</ref> one of the earliest Upanishads (approx. 900 BCE). The main textual sources for the evolving concept of Yoga are the middle [[Upanishads]], (ca. 400 BCE), the [[Mahabharata]] (5th c. BCE) including the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (ca. 200 BCE), and the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] (200 BCE-300 CE).

====Bhagavad Gita====
{{Main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The Bhagavad Gita ('Song of the Lord'), uses the term ''yoga'' extensively in a variety of senses.  Of many possible meanings given to the term in the Gita, most emphasis is given to these three:<ref>Flood, p. 96.</ref> 

*[[Karma yoga]]: The yoga of action
*[[Bhakti yoga]]: The yoga of devotion
*[[Jnana yoga]]: The yoga of knowledge

The influential commentator [[Madhusudana Sarasvati]] (b. circa 1490) divided the Gita's eighteen chapters into three sections, each of six chapters.  According to his method of division the first six chapters deal with Karma yoga, the middle six deal with Bhakti yoga, and the last six deal with Jnana (knowledge).<ref> Gambhirananda, p. 16.</ref> This interpretation has been adopted by some later commentators and rejected by others.

====Yoga Sutras of Patanjali====
{{main|Raja Yoga|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
In [[Indian philosophy]], Yoga is the name of one of the six [[astika|orthodox]] philosophical schools.<ref>For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents", and pp. 453-487.</ref><ref>For a brief overview of the Yoga school of philosophy see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref>  The Yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the [[Samkhya]] school.<ref>For close connection between Yoga philosophy and Samkhya, see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref>  The Yoga school as expounded by Patanjali accepts the Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is more theistic than the Samkhya, as evidenced by the addition of a divine entity to the Samkhya's twenty-five elements of reality.<ref>For Yoga acceptance of Samkhya concepts, but with addition of a category for God, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, p. 453.</ref><ref>For Yoga as accepting the 25 principles of Samkhya with the addition of God, see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref>  The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that [[Max Müller]] says that "the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord...."<ref>Müller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy", p. 104.</ref> The intimate relationship between Samkhya and Yoga is explained by [[Heinrich Zimmer]]:

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
These two are regarded in India as twins, the two aspects of a single discipline. {{IAST|Sāṅkhya}} provides a basic theoretical exposition of human nature, enumerating and defining its elements, analyzing their manner of co-operation in a state of bondage (''bandha''), and describing their state of disentanglement or separation in release (''{{IAST|mokṣa}}''), while Yoga treats specifically of the dynamics of the process for the disentanglement, and outlines practical techniques for the gaining of release, or 'isolation-integration' (''kaivalya'').<ref>Zimmer (1951), p. 280.</ref>
</blockquote>

The sage Patanjali is regarded as the founder of the formal Yoga philosophy.<ref>For Patanjali as the founder of the philosophical system called Yoga see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 42.</ref>  The [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] are ascribed to Patanjali, who, may have been, as Max Müller explains, "the author or representative of the Yoga-philosophy without being necessarily the author of the Sutras."<ref>Müeller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy", pp. 97-98.</ref> Indologist Axel Michaels is dismissive of claims that the work was written by Patanjali, characterizing it instead as a collection of fragments and traditions of texts stemming from the second or third century.<ref>For the Yoga Sutras as a collection dating to second or third century, see: Michaels, p. 267.</ref>  Gavin Flood cites a wider period of uncertainty for the composition, between 100 BCE and 500 CE.<ref>For dating between 100 BCE and 500 CE see: Flood (1996), page 96.</ref>

Patanjali's yoga is known as [[Raja yoga]], which is a system for control of the mind.<ref>For "raja yoga" as a system for control of the mind and connection to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras as a key work, see: Flood (1996), pp. 96-98.</ref>  Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra, which is the definitional sutra for his entire work:

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">''{{IAST|'''योग: चित्त-वृत्ति निरोध:''' <br> ( yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ ) }}''<br>- Yoga Sutras 1.2</blockquote> 

This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms.  I. K. Taimni translates it as "Yoga is the inhibition (''{{IAST|nirodhaḥ}}'') of the modifications (''{{IAST|vṛtti}}'')  of the mind (''{{IAST|citta}}'')".<ref>For text and word-by-word translation as "Yoga is the inhibition of the modifications of the mind" see: Taimni, p. 6.</ref>  [[Swami Vivekananda]] translates the sutra as "Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Citta) from taking various forms (Vrittis)."<ref>Vivekanada, p. 115.</ref>  Gavin Flood translates the sutra as "yoga is the cessation of mental fluctuations".<ref>For "yoga is the cessation of mental fluctuations" see: Flood (1996), p. 96.</ref>

[[Image:Yogisculpture.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A sculpture of a [[Hindu]] yogi in the [[Birla Mandir]], [[Delhi]]]]

Patanjali's writing also became the basis for a system referred to it as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"). This eight-limbed concept derived from the 29<sup>th</sup> Sutra of the 2<sup>nd</sup> book  became a feature of Raja yoga, and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today.[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=Ashtanga+Raja&btnG=Search]The Eight Limbs of yoga practice are:
:(1) ''[[Yamas|Yama]]'' (The five "abstentions"): nonviolence, truth, non-covetousness, chastity, and abstain from attachment to possessions.
:(2) ''[[Niyama]]'' (The five "observances"): purity, contentment, austerities, study, and surrender to [[god]]
:(3) ''[[Asana]]'': Literally means "seat", and in Patanjali's Sutras refers to seated positions used for meditation. Later, with the rise of Hatha yoga, asana came to refer to all the "postures"
:(4) ''[[Pranayama]]'' ("Lengthening Prāna"): ''Prāna'', life force, or vital energy, particularly, the breath, "āyāma", to lengthen or extend
:(5) ''[[Pratyahara]]'' ("Abstraction"): Withdrawal of the sense organs from external objects.
:(6) ''[[Dharana]]'' ("Concentration"): Fixing the attention on a single object
:(7) ''[[Dhyana]]'' ("Meditation"): Intense contemplation of the nature of the object of meditation
:(8) ''[[Samadhi]]'' ("Liberation"): merging consciousness with the object of meditation

It details every aspect of the meditative process, and the preparation for it. The book is available in as many as 40 English translations, both in-print and on-line.[http://www.haryana-online.com/Culture/yoga_sutras.htm][http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yogasutr.htm][http://hrih.hypermart.net/patanjali/library/3.htm][http://www.santosha.com/philosophy/samadhi-pada1.html][http://www.north-india.in/culture/yoga_sutras.htm][http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp25882][http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/patanjal/patanyog.htm] [http://www.dailyreadings.com/sutras_1.htm]

====Hatha Yoga Pradipika====
{{Main|Hatha yoga}}

Hatha Yoga is a particular system of Yoga described by [[Yogi Swatmarama]], a yogic sage of the 15th century in India, and compiler of the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]. Hatha Yoga is a development of — but also differs substantially from — the [[Raja Yoga]] of Patanjali, in that it focuses on ''[[shatkarma]]'', the purification of the physical as leading to the purification of the mind (''ha''), and ''[[prana]]'', or vital energy (''tha'').<ref>Living Yoga: Creating a Life Practice - Page 42 by Christy Turlington (page 42)</ref><ref>Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers - Page 10 by Nancy Gerstein </ref> In contrast, the Raja Yoga posited by Patanjali begins with a purification of the mind (''yamas'') and spirit (''niyamas''), then comes to the body via ''[[asana]]'' (body postures) and ''[[pranayama]]'' (breath). Hatha yoga contains substantial [[tantra|tantric]] influence,<ref>Mindfulness Yoga: The Awakened Union of Breath Body & Mind - Page 6 by Frank Jude Boccio</ref><ref>Yoga: The Indian Tradition By Ian Whicher, David Carpenter (page 8)</ref> and marks the first point at which [[chakras]] and [[kundalini]] were introduced into the yogic canon. Compared to the seated asanas of Patanjali's Raja yoga which were seen largely as a means of preparing for meditation, it also marks the development of asanas as full body 'postures' in the modern sense.<ref name=Burley>Hatha Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice By Mikel Burley (page 16)</ref>

Hatha Yoga in its many modern variations is the style that most people actually associate with the word "Yoga" today.<ref>Feuerstein, Georg. (1996). ''The Shambhala Guide to Yoga''. Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, Inc.</ref> Because its emphasis is on the body through ''asana'' and ''pranayama'' practice, many western students are satisfied with the physical health and vitality it develops and are not interested in the other six limbs of the complete Hatha yoga teaching, or with the even older Raja Yoga tradition it is based on.

===Yoga and Buddhism===

====Yogacara Buddhism====
[[Yogacara]] (Sanskrit: "Practice of Yoga [Union]"<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9077982/Yogacara Encyclopedia Britannica Article: Yogacara]</ref> ), also spelled yogāchāra, is a school of philosophy and psychology that developed in [[India]] during the 4th to 5th centuries.

Yogacara received the name as it provided a ''yoga'', a framework for engaging in the practices that lead to the path of the [[bodhisattva]].<ref>Dan Lusthaus. Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun. Published 2002 (Routledge).

Alexander Simpkins, Annellen M. Simpkins. Published 2001. Tuttle Publishing. ISBN 0804831998</ref>

====Ch`an (Zen) Buddhism====
Zen (the name of which derives from the Sanskrit "dhyana" via the Chinese "ch'an"<ref> The Buddhist Tradition in India, China, and Japan. Edited by William Theodore de Bary. Pgs. 207-208.ISBN: 0-394-71696-5 - "The Meditation school, called ''Ch'an'' in Chinese from the Sanskrit ''dhyāna'', is best known in the West by the Japanese pronunciation ''Zen''"</ref>) is a form of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Mahayana school of Buddhism is noted for its proximity with Yoga.<ref name=Heisig/> In the west, Zen is often set alongside Yoga; the two schools of meditation display obvious family resemblances.<ref> Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (Page xviii) </ref> This phenomenon merits special attention since the Zen Buddhist school of meditation has some of its roots in yogic practices.<ref>Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W.

ISBN 0941532895 [Exact quote: "This phenomenon merits special attention since yogic roots are to be found in the Zen Buddhist school of meditation."]</ref> Certain essential elements of Yoga are important both for Buddhism in general and for Zen in particular.<ref name=Knitter/>

====Tibetan Buddhism====
Yoga is central to [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In the [[Nyingma]] tradition, practitioners progress to increasingly profound levels of yoga, starting with [[Mahayoga|Mahā yoga]], continuing to [[Anuyoga|Anu yoga]] and ultimately undertaking the highest practice, [[Atiyoga|Ati yoga]]. In the [[Sarma]] traditions, the [[Anuttara yoga]] class is equivalent. Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm.  Timing in movement exercises is known as [[Trul khor]] or union of moon and sun (channel) prajna energies.  The body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of [[Lukhang]].

===Yoga and Tantra===
{{Main|Tantra}}
Tantrism, is a practice that is supposed to alter the relation of the individual practitioner of Tantrism to the ordinary social, religious, and logical reality in which he or she lives. Through [[Tantric]] practice an individual perceives reality as [[maya (illusion)|maya]], illusion, and the individual achieves liberation from it.<ref name=UCP>Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press,  1991. pp 313 </ref>

This particular path to salvation among the several offered by Hinduism, links Tantrism to those practices of [[Indian religions]], such as yoga, meditation, and social [[renunciation]], which are based on temporary or permanent withdrawal from social relationships and modes.<ref name=UCP/>

During tantric practices and studies, the student is instructed further in meditation technique, particularly [[Chakra|chakra meditation]]. This is often in a limited form in comparison with the way this kind of meditation is known and used by Tantric practitioners and yogis elsewhere, but is more elaborate than the initiate's previous meditation. It is considered to be a kind of [[Kundalini Yoga]] for the purpose of moving the Goddess into the chakra located in the "heart," for meditation and worship.<ref>Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press,  1991. pp 317 </ref>

==Goal of Yoga==
There are numerous opinions on what the goal of Yoga may be, although generally they involve some kind of union, either of a personal or a non-personal nature.

Within the [[Monism|monist]] schools of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Shaivism]] this perfection takes the form of ''[[Moksha]]'', which is a liberation from all worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death ([[Samsara]]) at which point there is a cessation of thought and an experience of blissful union with the Supreme [[Brahman]]. For the dualistic [[bhakti]] schools of [[Vaishnavism]], ''bhakti'' itself is the ultimate goal of the yoga process<ref> [http://vedabase.net/nbs/18/en1 Narada-bhakti-sutra Text 18] "Mukti, or liberation... is also not the ultimate goal... devotional service [bhakti] surpasses all other forms of liberation."</ref>, wherein perfection culminates in an eternal relationship with [[Vishnu]] or one of his associated [[avatar]]s such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]].<ref> [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9381693/Vaishnavism Brittanica Concise] "Characterized by an emphasis on bhakti, its goal is to escape from the cycle of birth and death in order to enjoy the presence of Vishnu."</ref>
