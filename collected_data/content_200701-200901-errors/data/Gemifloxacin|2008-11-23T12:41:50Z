'''Gemifloxacin mesylate''' (trade name '''Factive''', [[Oscient Pharmaceuticals]]) is an oral [[broad-spectrum]] [[quinolone]] [[antibacterial]] agent used in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic [[bronchitis]] and mild-to-moderate [[pneumonia]].
[[Oscient Pharmaceuticals]] has licensed the active ingredient from [[LG Life Sciences]] of Korea.

==Indications==

Gemifloxacin is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Success has been achieved in the treatment of [[viral]] fever with Gemifloxacin with good patient [[compliance]].
Acute bacterial exacerbation of [[chronic bronchitis]] caused by ''S. pneumoniae'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Haemophilus parainfluenzae'', or ''Moraxella catarrhalis''.
[[Community-acquired pneumonia]] (of mild to moderate severity) caused by ''S. pneumoniae'' (including multi-drug resistant strains, ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Moraxella catarrhalis'', ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'', ''Chlamydia pneumoniae'', or ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''.

==Microbiology==

Gemifloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms: 

:Aerobic [[gram-positive]] microorganisms - ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' including [[multi-drug resistant]] ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''  (MDRSP). MDRSP includes isolates previously known as PRSP (penicillin-resistant ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''), and are strains resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics: penicillin, 2nd generation [[cephalosporins]], e.g., [[cefuroxime]], [[macrolides]], [[tetracyclines]] and [[trimethoprim]]/[[sulfamethoxazole]].

:''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' ([[methicillin]]-susceptible strains only) and ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''

:Aerobic [[gram-negative]] microorganisms - ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Haemophilus parainfluenzae]]'', [[Klebsiella pneumoniae]] (many strains are moderately susceptible), [[Moraxella catarrhalis]], ''[[Acinetobacter lwoffii]]'', ''[[Klebsiella oxytoca]]'', ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'', ''[[Proteus vulgaris]]''.
:Other microorganisms - ''[[Chlamydia pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''

==Adverse effects==
{{main|Quinolone#Adverse effects}}

The side effects of gemifloxacin are similar to those of other [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics. The most common adverse effects are [[headache]], and [[dizziness]], [[rash]], [[nausea]] and [[diarrhea]].<ref name=Lexi-Comp>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/lexicomp/gemifloxacin.html |title=Gemifloxacin |date=August 2008 |author=Lexi-Comp |work=[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy|The Merck Manual Professional]]}} Retrieved on November 23, 2008.</ref> Serious, rare side effects (also common to all fluoroquinolones) include: [[tendon]] damage, known as ''quinolone-induced tendonopathy''; [[peripheral neuropathy]]; [[QT prolongation]]; [[central nervous system]] effects such as [[dizziness]], [[insomnia]], anxiety, tremors, and even [[hallucination]]s and [[seizure]]s; and abnormal [[blood sugar]] levels ([[hypoglycemia]] and [[hyperglycemia]], even in people who do not have [[diabetes]]).<ref name=Lexi-Comp/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mohr JF, McKinnon PS, Peymann PJ, Kenton I, Septimus E, Okhuysen PC |title=A retrospective, comparative evaluation of dysglycemias in hospitalized patients receiving gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1303–9 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16185173 |doi=10.1592/phco.2005.25.10.1303}}</ref>

===Tendon rupture===
All fluoroquinolones create a risk of spontaneous tendon rupture, most often of the [[Achilles tendon]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maurin N |title=[Fluoroquinolone-induced Achilles tendon rupture] |language=German |journal=Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946) |volume=133 |issue=6 |pages=241–4 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18236349 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1017503}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mehlhorn AJ, Brown DA |title=Safety concerns with fluoroquinolones |journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=41 |issue=11 |pages=1859–66 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17911203 |doi=10.1345/aph.1K347}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ng WF, Naughton M |title=Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy: a case report |journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports |volume=1 |issue= |pages=55 |year=2007 |pmid=17645801 |pmc=1950514 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-1-55 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/1/1/55}}</ref> Such ruptures may occur both during therapy and long after therapy has been discontinued; there are documented cases where such ruptures have occurred over a year later.

Since July 2008, all systemic fluoroquinolones (those [[route of administration|taken internally]], not as [[eye drop]]s or [[ear drop]]s) available in the United States must carry a [[black box warning|boxed warning]] warning of the risk of tendon damage.<ref name=FDA/>
