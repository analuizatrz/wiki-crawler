'''Bangladesh''', officially the '''People's Republic of Bangladesh''', is a [[country]] in [[South Asia]]. It is surrounded by [[India]] on all sides except for a small border with [[Myanmar]] to the far southeast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the south. Together with the Indian state of [[West Bengal]], it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]]. The name ''Bangladesh'' means "Country of Bengal" and is written as <!--The spelling is correct. If you see anything odd, your browser isn't Unicode compliant.--><big>বাংলাদেশ</big> and [[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{Audio-IPA|Bangladesh.ogg|['baŋlad̪eʃ]}} in the official [[Bengali language]].

The borders of Bangladesh were set by the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, when it became the eastern wing of [[Pakistan]] ([[East Pakistan]]), separated from the western wing by 1,600&nbsp;[[kilometre]]s (1,000&nbsp;miles). Despite their common religion of [[Islam]], the ethnic and linguistic gulf between the two wings, compounded by an apathetic government based in [[West Pakistan]], resulted in the independence of Bangladesh under the leadership of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] in 1971 after the bloody [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], in which it was supported by India. The years following independence have been marked by political turmoil, with thirteen different heads of government, and at least four [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military coups]].

The population of Bangladesh ranks [[List of countries by population|seventh]] in the world, but its area of approximately 144,000 square kilometres (55,600&nbsp;[[Square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) is ranked ninety-fourth, making it one of the [[List of countries by population density|most densely populated]] countries in the world, or the most densely populated country if small [[island nation]]s and [[city-state]]s are not included. It is the third-largest [[Muslim]]-majority nation, but has a slightly smaller Muslim population than the Muslim minority in India. Geographically dominated by the fertile [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta]], the country has annual [[monsoon]] floods, and [[cyclone]]s are frequent. Bangladesh is one of the founding members of [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), [[BIMSTEC]], and a member of the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference|OIC]] and the [[Developing 8 Countries|D-8]].

After the arrival of [[Indo-Aryans]], the kingdom of [[Gangaridai]] was formed from at least the seventh century&nbsp;BCE, which later united with [[Bihar]] under the [[Magadha]] and [[Maurya Empire]]s. Bengal was later part of the [[Gupta Empire]] from the third to the sixth centuries&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]]. Following its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named [[Shashanka]] founded an impressive yet short-lived kingdom. After a period of anarchy, the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the [[Hindu]] [[Sena dynasty]]. [[Islam]] was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by [[Sufism|Sufi]] missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region.<ref name="eaton">{{cite book |last=Eaton |first=R |year=1996 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier |publisher=University of California Press |id=ISBN 0-520-20507-3}}</ref> [[Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], a Turkish general, defeated [[Lakshman Sen]] of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal. The region was ruled by dynasties of [[Sultan]]s and feudal lords for the next few hundred years. By the sixteenth century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled Bengal, and [[Dhaka]] became an important provincial center of Mughal administration.

European traders arrived late in the fifteenth century, and their influence grew until the [[British East India Company]] gained control of Bengal following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757.<ref name="baxter">{{cite book

During colonial rule, famine racked the Indian subcontinent many times, including the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Great Bengal famine]] of 1943 that claimed 3 million lives.<ref name="sen">{{cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |year=1973 |title=Poverty and Famines |publisher=Oxford University Press |id=ISBN 0-19-828463-2}}</ref>

Between 1905 and 1911, an [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|abortive attempt]] was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones, with [[Dhaka]] being the capital of the eastern zone (Baxter,<ref name="baxter"/> pp. 39—40). When India was partitioned in 1947, Bengal was [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partitioned]] along religious lines, with the [[West Bengal|western part]] going to India and the eastern part joining [[Pakistan]] as a province called [[East Bengal]] (later renamed [[East Pakistan]]), with its capital at [[Dhaka]].<ref name="collins">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=L |coauthors=D Lapierre |year=1986 |title=Freedom at Midnight, Ed. 18 |publisher=Vikas Publishers, New Delhi |id=ISBN 0-7069-2770-2}}</ref>

In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the feudal [[Zamindar|zamindari]] system (Baxter,<ref name="baxter"/> p. 72). However, despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, Pakistan's government and military were largely dominated by the upper classes from the west. The [[Language Movement]] of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan (Baxter,<ref name="baxter"/> pp. 62—63). Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for [[Six point movement|autonomy]] in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising.

[[Image:Map Bangladesh RoadRail.png|thumb|left|150px|Map of Bangladesh showing road and rail lines.]]
In 1970, a massive [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] devastated the coast of East Pakistan, and the central government responded poorly. The Bengali population's anger was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose [[Awami League]] won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections, (Baxter,<ref name="baxter"/> pp. 78—79) was blocked from taking office. After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President [[Yahya Khan]] arrested him on the night of [[March 25]], [[1971]], and launched [[Operation Searchlight]],<ref name="salik">{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |year=1978 |title=Witness to Surrender |publisher=Oxford University Press |id=ISBN 0-19-577264-4}}</ref> a sustained military assault on East Pakistan.

Most of the Awami League leaders fled and set up a government-in-exile in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India. The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] lasted for nine months. The [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Mukti Bahini]] and Bengali regulars eventually received support from the [[Indian Armed Forces]] in December 1971. Under the command of [[Jagjit Singh Aurora|Lt. General J.S. Arora]], the [[Indian Army]] achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan on [[16 December]],[[1971]], taking over 90,000 [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]<ref name="burke">{{cite journal |last=Burke |first=S |year=1973 |title=The Postwar Diplomacy of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 |journal=Asian Survey |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=1036-1049}}</ref> in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].

After its independence, Bangladesh became a parliamentary democracy, with Mujib as the Prime Minister. In the 1973 parliamentary elections, the Awami League gained an absolute majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974,<ref name="sen"/> and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed [[BAKSAL]]. On [[August 15]], [[1975]], Mujib and his family were assassinated by mid-level military officers.<ref name="mascarenhas">{{cite book |last=Mascarenhas |first=A |year=1986 |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton, London |id=ISBN 0-340-39420-X}}</ref>

A series of bloody coups and counter-coups in the following three months culminated in the ascent to power of General [[Ziaur Rahman]], who reinstated multi-party politics and founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated in 1981 by elements of the military.<ref name="mascarenhas"/> Bangladesh's next major ruler was General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]], who gained power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and ruled until 1990, when he was forced to resign under western donor pressure in a major shift in international policy after the end of communism when anti-communist dictators were no longer felt necessary. Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, [[Khaleda Zia]], led the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] to parliamentary victories in 1991 and 2001 and was Prime Minister from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to end of 2006. At the present, the caretaker government is in power and after a successful election the new government will be formed. [[Sheikh Hasina]], one of Mujib's surviving daughters and the head of the Awami League, was in power from 1996 to 2001. Bangladesh enjoys the distinction of having two female politicians leading national politics. The country continues to suffer from extensive corruption,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4353334.stm Bangladesh tops most corrupt list] ([[BBC]])</ref> disorder and political violence.

[[Image:Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban (Roehl).jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] houses the Parliament of Bangladesh.]]
Bangladesh is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. The [[President of Bangladesh|President]] is the [[Head of State|head of state]], a largely ceremonial post. The real power is held by the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]]. The president is elected by the legislature every five years and has normally limited powers that are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], mainly in controlling the transition to a new government. Bangladesh has instituted a unique system of transfer of power; at the end of the tenure of a government, power is handed over to members of a [[Caretaker|civil society]] for three months, who run the general elections and transfer the power to elected representatives. This system was first practiced in 1991 and institutionalized in 1996 as the thirteenth amendment to the constitution.<ref name="amendments">{{cite encyclopedia  |url=http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/C_0336.htm |title=Constitutional Amendments |encyclopedia=[[Banglapedia]] |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref>

The [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|prime minister]] is ceremonially appointed by the president and must be a member of parliament ([[Member of Parliament|MP]]), commanding the confidence of the majority of the MPs. The [[cabinet]] is composed of [[Government minister|minister]]s selected by the prime minister and appointed by the president. The [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[parliament]] is the 300-member House of the Nation or ''[[Jatiyo Sangshad]]'', elected by popular vote from single-member constituencies for five-year terms of office. There is [[universal suffrage]] for all citizens from the age of 18.

The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] was written in 1972 and has undergone fourteen [[amendment]]s.<ref name="amendments"/> The highest [[judiciary]] body is the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]], whose Chief Justices and other judges are appointed by the President. The Judiciary is not separate from the administration, which has caused much commotion in recent years. Laws are loosely based on [[English law|English common law]], but family laws such as marriage and inheritance are based on religious scripts, and hence differ from one religious community to another.

The two [[List of political parties in Bangladesh|major parties]] in Bangladesh are the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) and [[Bangladesh Awami League]]. BNP finds its allies among [[Islamist]] parties like [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] and [[Islami Oikya Jot]], while [[Awami League]] aligns with [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Secularism|secularist]] parties. Another important player is the [[Jatiya Party]], headed by former military ruler Ershad. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been bitter and punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics is particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era. Almost all parties have highly active student wings, and students have been elected to the Parliament.

Two radical Islamist parties, [[Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh]] (JMJB) and [[Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh]] (JMB), were banned in February 2005. Bomb attacks taking place since 1999 have been blamed on those groups, and hundreds of suspected members have been detained in numerous security operations, including the head the of those two parties in 2006. The first recorded case of a suicide bomb attack in Bangladesh took place in November 2005.

==Administrative subdivisions==
[[Image:Bangladesh divisions english.png|thumb|150px|The six administrative divisions of Bangladesh.]]
{{main|Divisions of Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh is divided into six administrative divisions,<ref name="divisions">{{cite web |title=CIA World Fact Book, 2005 |url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2051.html}}</ref> each named after their respective divisional headquarters: [[Barisal Division|Barisal]] (<big>বরিশাল</big>), [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]] (<big>চট্টগ্রাম</big>), [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] (<big>ঢাকা</big>), [[Khulna Division|Khulna]] (<big>খুলনা</big>), [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] (<big>রাজশাহী</big>), and [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] (<big>সিলেট</big>)<!--The spelling is correct. If you see anything odd, your browser isn't Unicode compliant.-->.

Divisions are subdivided into administrative units known as ''zila'' (districts). There are sixty-four districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''thana'' ("police stations", formerly called ''upa-zila'' or sub-districts). The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''. There are no elected officials at the divisional, district or ''thana'' levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of twelve) in every union for female candidates.<ref name="unionwomen">''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997.</ref>

[[Dhaka]] is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. Other major cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Barisal]] and [[Sylhet]]. These metropolitan cities have [[mayor]]al elections, while other municipalities elect a chairperson. Mayors and chairpersons are elected for a span of five years.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Satellite image of Bangladesh in October 2001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Satellite image presenting physical features of Bangladesh.]]
{{main|Geography of Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh is located in the low-lying [[Ganges]]-[[Brahmaputra]] River Delta or [[Ganges Delta]]. This delta is formed by the confluence of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] deposited by these rivers has created some of the most highly fertile plains of the world.

Most parts of Bangladesh are less than {{convert|12|m|ft|0}} above the sea level, and it is believed that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by {{convert|1|m|ft|0}}.<ref name="ali">{{cite journal |last=Ali |first=A |year=1996 |title=Vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges |journal=Water, Air, & Soil Pollution |volume=92 |issue=1-2 |pages=171-179}}</ref>

The highest point in Bangladesh is in Mowdok range at {{convert|1052|m|ft|0}} in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] to the southeast of the country.<ref>[http://www.sol.co.uk/v/viewfinder/elevmisquotes.html#keok Summit Elevations: Frequent Internet Errors.] Retrieved 2006-04-13.</ref> A major part of the coastline comprises a [[marsh]]y [[jungle]], the [[Sundarbans]], the largest [[mangrove]] forest in the world and home to diverse flora and fauna, including the [[Royal Bengal Tiger]]. In 1997, this region was declared endangered.<ref name="sundarbans">{{cite journal |last=IUCN |year=1997 |title=Sundarban wildlife sanctuaries Bangladesh |journal=World Heritage Nomination-IUCN Technical Evaluation}}</ref>

Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Bangladeshi climate is [[Tropics|tropical]] with a mild winter from October to March, a hot, humid summer from March to June. A warm and humid [[monsoon]] season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as [[flood]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[tidal bore]]s occur almost every year, combined with the effects of [[deforestation]], [[Soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] and [[erosion]]. [[Cox's Bazar]], south of the city of [[Chittagong]], has a beach that stretches uninterrupted over {{convert|120|km|mi|0}}; it is the longest unbroken natural sea beach in the world.

[[Image:BDricefield.jpg|thumb|220px|Worker in a [[Paddy field|paddy]], a common scene throughout Bangladesh.]]
{{main|Economy of Bangladesh}}
Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains an underdeveloped and [[Overpopulation|overpopulated]] nation. The [[per capita income]] in 2004 was a low US$440, and many other economic indicators were less than impressive.<ref name="unicef_stats">[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/bangladesh_bangladesh_statistics.html Bangladesh Country Statistics], [[United Nations Children's Fund|Unicef]]</ref> Yet, as the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] notes in its July 2005 Country Brief, the country has made impressive progress in human development by focusing on increasing [[literacy]], achieving gender parity in schooling, and reducing population growth.

[[Jute]] was once the economic engine of the country. Its share of the world export market peaked in the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the late 1940s at 80%<ref name="jute">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/J_0135.htm |title=Jute |encyclopedia=[[Banglapedia]] |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref> and even in the early 1970s accounted for 70% of its export earnings. However, [[polypropylene]] products began to substitute for jute products worldwide and the jute industry started to decline. Bangladesh grows significant quantities of rice, tea and [[Mustard plant|mustard]]. Although two-thirds of Bangladeshis are farmers, more than three quarters of Bangladesh’s export earnings come from the [[garment industry]],<ref name="garments">{{cite news |last=Roland |first=B |date=2005  |title=Bangladesh Garments Aim to Compete |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4118969.stm}}</ref> which began attracting foreign investors in the 1980s due to cheap labour and low conversion cost. In 2002, the industry exported US$5 billion worth of products.<ref name="rahman">{{cite journal |last=Rahman |first=S  |year=2004 |title=Global Shift: Bangladesh Garment Industry in Perspective |journal=Asian Affairs |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=75-91}}</ref> The industry now employs more than 3 million workers, 90% of whom are women.<ref name="begum">{{cite book |last=Begum |first=N |chapter=Enforcement of Safety Regulations in Garment sector in Bangladesh |title=Proc. Growth of Garment Industry in Bangladesh: Economic and Social dimension |year=2001 |pages=208-226}}</ref> A large part of foreign currency earnings also comes from the remittances sent by [[expatriate]]s living in other countries.

Obstacles to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, mismanaged [[port]] facilities, a growth in the labour force that has outpaced jobs, inefficient use of energy resources (such as [[natural gas]]), insufficient power supplies, slow implementation of economic reforms, political infighting and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. According to the World Bank's July 2005 Country Brief, "Among Bangladesh’s most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions."<ref name="worldbank-brief">
[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/BANGLADESHEXTN/0,,menuPK:295769~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:295760,00.html Bangladesh - Country Brief], [[World Bank]], July 2005</ref>

Since 1990, the country has achieved an average annual growth rate of 5% according to the World Bank, despite the hurdles. The [[middle class]] and the [[consumer]] industry have seen some growth. In December 2005, four years after its report on the emerging "[[BRIC]]" economies ([[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], and [[People's Republic of China|China]]), [[Goldman Sachs]] named Bangladesh one of the "[[Next Eleven]],"<ref name="nextele">{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000177&sid=aoJ4WG5LSf1s&refer=market_insight |title=South Korea, Another `BRIC' in Global Wall |date=2005-12-09}}</ref> along with [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], Pakistan and several other countries. Bangladesh has seen a sharp increase in [[foreign direct investment]]. A number of [[multinational corporation]]s, including [[Unocal Corporation]] and [[Tata]], have made major investments, with the [[natural gas]] sector being a priority. In December 2005, the [[Bangladesh Bank|Central Bank of Bangladesh]] projected GDP growth around 6.5%.<ref name="bdbank1">[http://www.bangladesh-bank.org/pub/annual/anreport/annual.html Annual Report 2004-2005, Bangladesh Bank]</ref>

One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of [[microcredit]] by [[Muhammad Yunus]] (awarded the  [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] [[Nobel Peace Prize|peace prize]] in 2006) through the [[Grameen Bank]]. By the late 1990s, Grameen Bank had 2.3 million members, along with 2.5 million members of other similar organizations.<ref name="schreiner">{{cite journal |last=Schreiner |first=Mark |year=2003 |title=A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh |journal=Development Policy Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=357-382}}</ref>

In order to enhance economic growth, the government set up several export processing zones to attract foreign investment. These are managed by the [[Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority]].

Bangladesh has recently been the subject of increasing Foreign Direct Investment. Other Foreign Non-Bangladeshi and Bangladeshi based companies e.g. Shell, BP and [[Royal Bengal Airline]] are examples of such inward investment.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Dhaka-panorama.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Dhaka is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.]]
{{main|Demographics of Bangladesh}}
Recent estimates of Bangladesh's population range from 142 to 147 million, making it one of the ten most populous countries in the world. With a population similar to [[Russia]]'s confined to an area of 144,000 square kilometers (55,600&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it is very densely populated. Bangladesh's population growth was among the highest in the world in the 1960s and 1970s, when the count grew from 50 to 90 million, but with the promotion of [[birth control]] in the 1980s, the growth rate slowed. The total [[fertility rate]] is now 3.1 children per woman, compared with 6.2 three decades ago. The population is relatively young, with the 0&ndash;25 age group comprising 60%, while 3% are 65 or older. [[Life expectancy]] is 63 years for both males and females.<ref name="who">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2005/en/ |title=World Health Report 2005 |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>

Bangladesh is ethnically homogeneous, with [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] comprising 98% of the population. The remainder are mostly [[Bihar]]i migrants and indigenous tribal groups. There are thirteen tribal groups located in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], the most populous of the tribes are the [[Chakma people|Chakmas]]. The region has been a source for ethnic tension since the inception of Bangladesh.<ref name="rashiduzzaman">{{cite journal |last=Rashiduzzaman |first=M |year=1998 |title=Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord: Institutional Features and Strategic Concerns |journal=Asian Survey |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=653-670}}</ref>
The largest tribal groups outside the Hill Tracts are the [[Santal|Santhals]] and the [[Garo (tribe)|Garos (Achiks)]]. [[Trafficking in human beings|Human trafficking]] has been a lingering problem in Bangladesh<ref name="pachar">{{cite book |last=Gazi |first=R |coauthors=ZH Chowdhury, SMN Alam, E Chowdhury, F Ahmed, S Begum |year=2001 |title=Trafficking of Women and Children in Bangladesh, Special Publication No. 11 |publisher=ICDDR,B |url=http://www.usaid.gov/bd/files/trafficking_overview.pdf}}</ref>

The main language, as in [[West Bengal]], is [[Bengali language|Bangla]] (Bengali), an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] of [[Sanskrit]] origin and has its own [[Bengali script|script]]. Bangla is the official language of Bangladesh.  [[English language|English]] is used as second language among the middle and upper classes and in higher education. Since a President Order in 1987, Bangla is used for all official correspondence except foreign ones.

Two major religions practised in Bangladesh are [[Islam]] (88% US State Department est. 2005) and [[Hinduism]] (11% US State Dept. 2005). Ethnic [[Bihari people|Biharis]] are predominantly [[Shi'a Islam|Shia]] Muslims. Other religious groups include [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhists]], [[Christianity|Christians]], and [[Animism|Animists]].

Health and education levels have recently improved as poverty levels have decreased. Nevertheless, Bangladesh remains among the poorest nations in the world. Most Bangladeshis are rural, living on subsistence farming. Nearly half of the population lives on less than 1 USD per day.<ref name="usaid">{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/policy/budget/cbj2005/ane/bd.html |title=Congressional Budget Justification - FY 2005 |publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]}}</ref>

The literacy rate in Bangladesh is approximately 41%.<ref name="undp">{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/countries.cfm?c=BGD |title=2005 Human Development Report |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]}}</ref> There is gender disparity, though, as literacy rates are 50% among men and 31% among women, according to a 2004 [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] estimate.<ref name="unicef">[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/bangladesh_bangladesh_statistics.html UNICEF: Bangladesh Statistics].</ref> Literacy has gone up due to many programs introduced in the country. Among the most successful ones are the ''Food for education'' (FFE) program introduced in 1993,<ref name="ahmed">{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=A |coauthors=C del Nino |year=2002 |title=The food for education program in Bangladesh: An evaluation of its impact on educational attainment and food security, FCND DP No. 138 |publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute}}</ref> and a stipend program for women at the primary and secondary levels.<ref name="female_stipend">{{cite book |last=Khandker |first=S |coauthors=M Pitt, N Fuwa |year=2003 |title=Subsidy to Promote Girls’ Secondary Education: the Female Stipend Program in Bangladesh |publisher=World Bank, Washington, DC}}</ref>

{{main|Culture of Bangladesh}}
A new state for an old nation, Bangladesh has a culture that encompasses elements both old and new. The [[Bangla language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, which Bangladesh shares with the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]]. The earliest literary text in Bangla is the eighth century [[Charyapada]]. Bangla literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). Bangla literature matured in the nineteenth century. Its greatest icons are the poets [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]. Bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'', ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'' or stories related to ''[[Gopal Bhar]]''.

The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (''Baniprodhan''), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music, and there are numerous other musical traditions in Bangladesh, which vary from one region to the other. [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]], [[Bhawaiya]] are a few of the better-known musical forms. Folk music of Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], an instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]]. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition. Bangladesh produces about 80 films a year.<ref name="hayat">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/F_0076.htm Feature film] in Banglapedia</ref> Mainstream [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] are also quite popular, as are films from [[Kolkata]], which has its own thriving Bengali-language movie industry. Around 200 dailies are published in Bangladesh, along with more than 1800 periodicals. However, regular readership is low, nearly about 15% of the population.<ref name="newspapers">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/N_0169.htm Newspapers and periodicals] in Banglapedia</ref> Bangladeshis listen to a variety of local and national radio programmes from [[Bangladesh Betar]], as well as Bangla services from the [[BBC]] and [[Voice of America]]. There is a state-controlled [[Bangladesh Television|television channel]], but in the last few years, privately owned channels have grown considerably.

The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Middle Eastern cuisine]] as well as having many unique traits. Rice and fish are traditional favourites; leading to a common saying that "fish and rice make a Bengali" (''machhe bhate bangali''). Meat consumption has increased with higher production in recent years. Bangladeshis make distinctive [[confectionary|sweetmeat]]s from milk products; some common ones are ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Chômchôm'' and ''Kalojam''. 

The [[sari]] ''(shaŗi)'' is by far the most widely worn dress by Bangladeshi women. However, the [[salwar kameez]] ''(shaloar kamiz)'' is also quite popular, and in urban areas some women wear Western attire. Among men, European dressing has greater acceptance. Men also use the ''[[kurta]]-paejama'' combination, often on religious occasions. The [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt, is widely worn by Bangladesh men.

The two [[Eid]]s, [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]] are the largest festivals in the Islamic calendar. The day before Eid ul-Fitr is called ''Chãd Rat'' (the night of the Moon), and is often marked by firecrackers. Other [[Muslim holidays]] are also observed. Major Hindu festivals are [[Durga]] [[Puja]] and [[Saraswati]] [[Puja]]. [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], is one of the most important Buddhist festivals while [[Christmas]], called ''Bôŗodin'' (Great day) in [[Bangla]] is celebrated by the minority Christian population. The most important secular festival is [[Pohela Baishakh]] or Bengali New Year, the beginning of the [[Bangla calendar|Bengali calendar]]. Other festivities include [[Nobanno]], ''Poush parbon'' (festival of [[Poush]]) and observance of national days like [[Language movement|Shohid Dibosh]].

[[Cricket]] is one of the most popular [[sports in Bangladesh]].  In 2000, the [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh cricket team]] was granted [[Test cricket]] status and joined the elite league of national teams permitted by the [[International Cricket Council]] to play test matches. Other popular sports include [[football (soccer)]], [[field hockey]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[chess]], [[carom]], and [[kabadi]], a 7-a-side team-sport played without a ball or any other equipment, which is the national sport of Bangladesh. The [[Bangladesh Sports Control Board]] regulates 29 different sporting federations.
