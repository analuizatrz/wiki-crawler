A '''scorpion''' is an [[invertebrate]] animal with eight legs, belonging to the order ''Scorpiones'' in the class [[Arachnida]]. Scorpions are related to [[spiders]], [[mites]], and [[ticks]]. 

 
==Physical characteristics==
The body of a scorpion is divided into two segments: the [[cephalothorax]] (also called the prosoma) and the [[abdomen]]/opisthosoma. The abdomen consists of the [[mesosoma]] and the metasoma.

'''Cephalothorax/prosoma''': the scorpion's “head”, comprising the [[carapace]], [[eye]]s, [[chelicerae]] (mouth parts), [[pedipalp]]s ([[claw]]) and the four pairs of [[arthropod leg|walking legs]].

'''Mesosoma''': the abdomen's front half, is made up of six segments. The first segment contains the [[sex organ|sexual organs]] as well as a pair of vestigial and modified appendages forming a structure called the genital operculum. The second segment bears a pair of featherlike [[sensor]]y organs known as the ''pectines''; the final four segments each contain a pair of [[book lung]]s. The mesosoma is [[armor]]ed with [[chitin]]ous plates, known as [[tergites]] on the upper surface and  [[sternites]] on the lower surface.

'''Metasoma''': the scorpion's [[tail (anatomy)|tail]], comprising six segments (the first tail segment looks like a last mesosoman segment), the last containing the scorpion's [[anus]] and bearing the [[telson]] (the [[sting (biology)|sting]]). The telson, in turn, consists of the [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]], which holds a pair of [[venom]] glands and the hypodermic aculeus, the venom-injecting [[barb]].

'''Cuticle''': this makes a tough armor around the body. In some places it is covered with hairs that act like balance organs. An outer layer that makes them fluorescent green under [[ultraviolet light]] is called the hyaline layer. Newly molted scorpions do not glow until after their cuticle has hardened. The fluoresent hyaline layer can be intact in fossil rocks that are hundreds of millions of years old.

===Two tails===
On rare occasions, scorpions can be born with two metasoma (tails). Two-tailed scorpions are not a species, but rather a genetic abnormality.<ref> http://www.sasionline.org/pepe.htm</ref>.

== Scorpion venom ==

All scorpion species possess [[venom (poison)|venom]]. In general, scorpion venom is described as [[Neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] in nature. One exception to this however is ''Hemiscorpius lepturus'' which possesses [[cytotoxic]] venom. The neurotoxins consist of a variety of small [[protein]]s as well as sodium and potassium [[cation]]s, which serve to interfere with neurotransmission in the victim. Scorpions use their venom to kill or paralyze their prey so that it can be eaten; in general it is fast acting, allowing for effective prey capture.

Scorpion venoms are optimized for action upon other [[arthropod]]s and therefore most scorpions are relatively harmless to humans; stings produce only local effects (such as pain, numbness or swelling). A few scorpion species, however, mostly in the family [[Buthidae]], can be dangerous to humans. Among the most dangerous are ''[[Leiurus quinquestriatus]]'', otherwise dubiously known as the deathstalker, which has the most potent venom in the family, and members of the genera ''Parabuthus'', ''Tityus'', ''Centruroides'', and especially ''Androctonus'', which also have strong venom. The scorpion which is responsible for the most human deaths is the ''[[Fattail scorpion|Androctonus australis]]'', or fat-tailed scorpion of North Africa. The toxicity of ''A. australis''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s venom is roughly half that of ''Leiurus quinquestriatus,'' but since ''A. australis'' injects quite a bit more venom into its prey, it is the most deadly to humans. Human deaths normally occur in the young, elderly, or infirm; scorpions are generally unable to deliver enough venom to kill healthy adults.  Some people, however may be allergic to the venom of some species, in which case the scorpion's sting can more likely kill. A primary symptom of a scorpion sting is numbing at the injection site, sometimes lasting for several days.  Scorpions are generally harmless and timid, and only voluntarily use their sting for killing prey or defending themselves. Generally, they will run from danger or remain still.

Scorpions are able to regulate how much venom is injected with each sting using striated muscles in the stinger, the usual amount being between 0.1 and 0.6 mg. There is also evidence to suggest that scorpions restrict the use of their venom using it only to subdue large prey, or prey that struggles. It has been found that scorpions have two types of venom: a translucent, weaker venom designed to stun only, and an opaque, more potent venom designed to kill heavier threats. This is likely because it is expensive in terms of energy for a scorpion to produce venom, and because it may take several days for a scorpion to replenish its venom supply once it has been exhausted.<ref> [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2081.htm Scorpion Sting]</ref><ref> [http://home.online.no/~janor/paper.htm Sting Use In Two Species of Parabuthus Scorpions (Buthidae)]</ref>

== Reproduction ==

Scorpions reproduce sexually and most species have male and female individuals. While the majority of scorpion species reproduce sexually, some such as, ''Hottentotta hottentotta'', ''Liocheles australasiae'', ''Tityus columbianus'', ''Tityus metuendus'', ''Tityus serrulatus'', ''Tityus stigmurus'', ''Tityus trivittatus'', and ''Tityus urugayensis'', all reproduce through parthenogenesis, a process in which unfertilized eggs develop into living embryos. Parthenogenic reproduction starts following the scorpions final molt to maturity and continues thereafter. Sexual reproduction is accomplished by the transfer of a [[spermatophore]] from the [[male]] to the [[female]]; scorpions possess a complex [[courtship]] and [[mating]] ritual to effect this transfer.

Mating starts with the [[male]] and [[female]] locating and identifying each other using a mixture of [[pheromones]] and [[oscillation|vibration]]al communication; once they have satisfied each other that they are of opposite sex and of the correct species, mating can commence.

The courtship starts with the male grasping the female’s pedipalps with his own; the pair then performs a "dance" called the "promenade à deux". In reality this is the male leading the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his [[spermatophore]]. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviours such as [[juddering]] and a cheliceral kiss (in which the male's chelicerae--clawlike mouthparts--grasp the female's in a smaller, more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps and in some cases injecting a small amount of his venom into her body {{Fact|date=February 2007}} <!--The online source for this is no longer available, and I'm not sure how reliable it was. A scholarly or expert source is necessary. --[[User:194.145.161.227|194.145.161.227]] 12:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)-->), probably as a means of pacifying the female.

When he has identified a suitable location, he deposits the spermatophore and then guides the female over it. This allows the spermatophore to enter her [[genital opercula]], which triggers release of the sperm, thus fertilizing the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours and depends on the ability of the male to find a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. If mating goes on for too long, the female may eventually break off the process.

Once the mating is complete, the male and female quickly separate. The male will generally retreat quickly, most likely to avoid being cannibalized by the female, although sexual [[cannibalism]] is infrequent with scorpions.

== Birth and development ==

[[Image: scorpionwithyoung.JPG|200px|right|thumb|''Compsobuthus werneri'' female with young]]

Unlike the majority of [[Arachnida]] species, scorpions are [[viviparous]]. The young are born one by one, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one [[ecdysis|moult]]. Before the first moult, scorplings cannot survive naturally without the mother, depending on her for protection and to regulate their moisture levels. Especially in species which display more advanced sociability (e.g ''Pandinus'' spp.), the young/mother association can continue for an extended period of time. The size of the litter depends on the species and can range from three to 100+ scorplings.<ref> Lourenco W. R., 2000, Reproduction in scorpions, with special reference to parthenogenesis, European Arachnology, pp. 71-85</ref>

The young generally resemble their parents. Growth is accomplished by periodical shedding of the exoskeleton ([[ecdysis]]). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in [[instars]] (how many moults it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Moulting is effected by means of a split in the old [[exoskeleton]] which takes place just below the edge of the carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split; the pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the [[metasoma]]. When it emerges, the scorpion’s new [[exoskeleton]] is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called [[sclerotization]]. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce; as [[sclerotization]] occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.

== Life and habits ==

Scorpions have quite variable lifespans and the actual lifespan of most species is not known. The age range appears to be approximately 4-25 years (25 years being the maximum reported life span in the species ''H. arizonensis'').

Scorpions prefer to live in areas where the temperatures range from 20°C to 37°C (68°F to 99°F), but may survive in the temperature range of 14°C to 45°C (57°F to 113°F). [http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/53/3/547.pdf][http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jvatitd/v12n1/28301.pdf] 

They  are [[nocturnal]] and [[fossorial]], finding shelter during the day in the relative cool of underground holes or undersides of rocks and coming out at night to hunt and feed. Scorpions exhibit [[photophobia|photophobic]] behavior, primarily to evade destruction by their predators such as birds, centipedes, lizards, mice, possums, and rats. [http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/scorpions.htm]

Scorpions are opportunistic predators of small arthropods and insects. They use their chela (pincers) to catch the prey initially. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with [[neurotoxic]] venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have a quite unique style of eating which uses [[chelicerae]]. These are small claw like structures which protrude from the mouth, only a handful of other animals have these, including [[spider]]s and [[Uropygid|vinegaroons]]. Chelicerae are very sharp and are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion. Scorpions can only digest food in a liquid form; any solid matter (fur, [[exoskeleton]], etc) is disposed of by the scorpion.

Scorpions have been found in many fossil records, including coal deposits from the [[Carboniferous Period]] and in marine [[Silurian]] deposits. They are thought to have existed in some form since about 425–450 million years ago. They are believed to have an oceanic origin, with gills and a claw like appendage that enabled them to hold onto rocky shores or seaweed. 

The ''[[eurypterida|eurypterids]]'', [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] creatures which lived during the [[Paleozoic]] era, share several physical traits with scorpions and are closely related to it. Various species of ''Eurypterida'' could grow to be anywhere from 10 cm (4 in) to 3 m (9.75 ft) in length. However, they exhibit [[anatomy|anatomical]] differences marking them off as a group distinct from their Carboniferous and recent descendants. Despite this, some refer to them as "sea scorpions."
[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/arthropoda/chelicerata/eurypterida.html]. Their legs are thought to have been short, thick, tapering and to have ended in a single strong claw; it appears that they were well-adapted for maintaining a secure hold upon rocks or seaweed against the wash of waves, like the legs of shore-[[crab]].

==Geographical distribution==
[[Image:Bark Scorpion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Hadrurus spadix'' - Caraboctonidae, Hadrurinae]]
Scorpions are almost universally distributed south of 49° N, and their geographical distribution shows in many particulars a close and interesting correspondence with that of the [[mammal]]s, including their entire absence from [[New Zealand]]. The facts of their distribution are in keeping with the hypothesis that the order originated in the [[northern hemisphere]] and migrated southwards into the southern continent at various epochs, their absence from the countries to the north of the above-mentioned latitudes being due, no doubt, to the comparatively recent [[glaciation]] of those areas. When they reached [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]] was part of that continent; but their arrival in [[Australia]] was subsequent to the separation of New Zealand from the Austro-Malayan area to the north of it. Moreover, the occurrence of closely related forms in Australia and [[South America]] on the one hand, and in tropical Africa and the northern parts of South America on the other, suggests very forcibly that South America was at an early date connected with Australia by a transpacific bridge and with Africa by a more northern transatlantic tract of land.

In conformity with their wide dispersal, scorpions have become adapted to diverse conditions of existence, some thriving in [[rainforest]]s, others on open [[plain]]s, others in sandy [[desert]]s and a few even at high altitudes where the ground is covered with snow throughout the winter. In the tropics, they [[aestivate]] at times of drought; and in the [[Alps]], they pass the cold months of the year in a state of [[hibernation]].

In the United States, scorpions are most common in southern Arizona and in a swath of land extending through central Texas and central Oklahoma. The common striped scorpion, ''Centruroides vittatus'', reaches from northwest Mexico to southern Colorado, Kansas, southern Missouri, and Mississippi. Species of the genus ''Vaejovis'' are found from Florida north to Maryland, the Carolinas, and Tennessee, and as far west as Oregon and California. ''Paruroctonus boreus'' is found through the Northwest U.S. and into Canada. Scorpions can be found in 31 different states in the U.S., including [[Hawaii]] (''Isometrus maculatus'').

Five colonies of scorpions (''Euscorpius flavicaudis'') have established themselves in southern [[England]] having probably arrived with imported fruit from [[Africa]], but the number of colonies could be lower now because of the destruction of their habitats. This scorpion species is small and completely harmless to humans.

[[Sahara]] Scorpion:

The arthropod most commonly associated with deserts, scorpions in the Sahara come in 30 different varieties, most from the family [[Buthidae]]. Four of the Sahara's scorpion species are lethal to humans. In humans, their venom can cause temporary paralysis, convulsions, cardiac arrest, or respiratory failure. The venom of some scorpion species is as toxic as that of a cobra. Saharan scorpions primarily limit their activity to the night, burrowing into the cooler sands beneath the desert's surface during the day. It absorbs water from the flesh of its prey.

== Suicide misconception ==

The belief that scorpions commit suicide by stinging themselves to death when surrounded by [[fire]] is of considerable antiquity and is often prevalent where these animals exist. It is nevertheless untrue since the venom has no effect on the scorpion itself, nor on any member of the same species (unless the venom is injected directly into the scorpion's nerve ganglion—quite an unlikely event outside of the laboratory). The misconception may derive from the fact that scorpions are poikilotherms ([[cold-blooded]]): when exposed to intense heat their metabolic processes malfunction. This causes the scorpion to spasm wildly and this spasming may appear as if the scorpion is stinging itself. It is also untrue that [[alcohol]] will cause scorpions to sting themselves to death.

== Radiation ==
[[Image:Sorpion_Under_Blacklight.jpg|thumb|250px|A scorpion under a [[Black light|blacklight]].  In normal lighting this scorpion appears black.]]
It is said that scorpions can survive high levels of [[radiation]], such as that which results from the detonation of [[nuclear weapons]]. Indeed, scorpions have been observed surviving the radiation from nuclear weapons tests at [[List of nuclear tests#France|French test sites]] in the [[Sahara]].<ref> Wee, Chua Kian. 1997. What is a scorpion http://web.singnet.com.sg/~chuaeecc/what/what.htm </ref>
Scorpions are also known to glow when exposed to certain types of ultraviolet light such as that which is produced by a [[Black light|blacklight]]. [http://www.public.asu.edu/~bbackes/images/scorpion2.jpg]

== Cultural symbolism ==
[[Image: Scorpion bowl iran.jpg|thumb|right|Bowl depicting scorpions. Excavated at Halilrud area. 3rd Millennium BC, [[Jiroft Kingdom]], [[Iran]]]]
The scorpion has had various meanings and representations in different cultures in history:

*In Mesopotamia, [[Gilgamesh]] for example approaches mountains where scorpion folk guard the entrance. Additionally, the [[Akkadians]] called the constellation [[Scorpio]], Girtab, meaning the Seizer, or Stinger and "Place Where One Bows Down".

*In Egyptian mythology, the scorpion stands for [[Set (mythology)|Set]], the Trickster and brother of [[Nephthys]], nemesis and opponent of [[Osiris]], and [[Isis]].

*The [[Falaknuma Palace]] of [[Hyderabad, India]], is laid out in the shape of a scorpion with two stingers spreading out as wings to the north.

*In [[Greek mythology]], the scorpion is conjured by the gods to hound and punish [[Orion]].

== Other use ==

From a Biblical quotation, it is the term for a severe Roman [[scourge]]. Hard material was fixed onto multiple thongs to give them a flesh-tearing bite [''1 Kings 12:11: ...My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions'']. The choice of the name testifies how much the hellish pain caused by the small animal is to be feared.

Its tail is also part of the persian [[mythical]] monster [[manticore]].

==In popular culture==
*The human tank in the ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved|Halo]]'' series of video games is called the Scorpion.
*''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' character [[Scorponok]] transformed into a giant scorpion.
*One of the most famous [[Mortal Kombat]] characters is named [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]].
*One of [[spiderman]]'s villains, a man called [[Mac Gargan]] was given the abilities of a scorpion through an experiment and was hired by J. Jonah Jameson to hunt down spiderman.
*The Sasword [[Zecter]] in [[Kamen Rider Kabuto]] carries the motif of the scorpion.
*Professional Wrestler Sting uses scorpions for the background of his gimmick, and on his wrestling attire.
*The Scorpion's tail is used as the symbol for the Brotherhood of Nod in the Command & Conquer video game series.
*Was the namesake of the [[2002]] film ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' featuring [[The Rock]].
*The [[Pokémon]] [[Skorupi]] and [[Drapion]] are styled after scorpions. Also, [[Gligar]] and [[Gliscor]] are classified as Scorpionfly Pokémon.
*Scorpion is class of [[battleship]] in the [[MMORPG]] [[EVE Online]].
*In the videogame [[Sonic & The Secret Rings]] - the [[Sand Scorpion]] is the first Boss the player can face. However, it's resemblance to an actual scorpion is questionable at best...
*In [[Final Fantasy VII]], a mechanical scorpion is the first boss that Cloud and Barret fight in the Mako Reactor.
