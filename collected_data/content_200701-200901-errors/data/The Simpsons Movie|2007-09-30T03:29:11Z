'''''The Simpsons Movie''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[animation|animated]] [[comedy film]] based on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and directed by [[David Silverman]]. The film was produced by [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Scully]], and [[Richard Sakai]] and written by eleven of the television series' most prolific writers: Scully, Jean, Brooks, Groening, [[George Meyer]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Jon Vitti]], [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], and [[Matt Selman]]. It stars the regular television cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright (actress)|Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Pamela Hayden]], and [[Tress MacNeille]] and features [[Albert Brooks]] in a prominent guest role, as well as [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Green Day]] in smaller ones.

After previous attempts to create a film version of ''The Simpsons'' had failed because of script length and lack of staff, production began in 2001. Numerous plot ideas were conceived by the writers, with Matt Groening's being developed into the film. The script was re-written one hundred times, continuing after animation had begun. This meant that "two films' worth" of finished material was cut, including cameos from [[Isla Fisher]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Erin Brockovich]], and [[Kelsey Grammer]]. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including [[Burger King]] and [[7-Eleven]], who [[Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed select stores]] into [[Kwik-E-Mart]]s. The film premiered in [[Springfield, Vermont]], which won the right to hold it through a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] competition. 

==Plot==
<!--If you do not want spoilers, then do not read this section. Please keep plot to this length, no spoiler tags. It is a basic over view of the film, not a blow by blow description of jokes.-->
[[Green Day]] is performing on Lake Springfield, where they fail to engage the audience in discussing the [[environmentalism|environment]]. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge, causing it to sink. At the funeral, [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] has a religious vision, in which he predicts impending doom upon the town, but only Homer's wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] pays attention to it. Their environmentalist daughter [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and an [[Irish people|Irish]] boy, [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Colin]] hold a seminar where they convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig, which causes his now neglected son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to seek a parental figure in neighbor, [[Ned Flanders]]. Homer keeps the pig's waste in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge, who tells Homer to dispose of it safely. However, Homer is distracted and instead dumps the silo into the lake, polluting it severely. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Nearby, Flanders and Bart bond during a hike and discover the squirrel which is captured by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, takes drastic action by enclosing Springfield in a giant glass dome.

When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, an angry mob approaches the Simpsons' home and sets it on fire. The family escapes through a [[sinkhole]] in [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s sandbox and flees to [[Alaska]]. Meanwhile, cracks in the dome cause Cargill to plan Springfield's destruction. The Simpsons see a television advertisement which promotes a new [[Grand Canyon]] where Springfield is. Marge and the kids decide to save the town, but Homer refuses to help the people that tried to kill them. They abandon him and leave to rescue Springfield, only to be captured and placed back in the dome. After a visit with a mysterious [[Inuit mythology|Inuit shaman]], Homer has an epiphany that he must save the city and proceeds to doing so. Just as he arrives, a helicopter appears above Springfield and lowers a bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs to the peak of the dome and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and bomb off. Homer then notices a motorcycle, is reunited with Bart and grabs the bomb. They cycle up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb then explodes on the peak of the dome, shattering it. The town praises Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset. The film ends with the townspeople restoring Springfield, including the Simpsons' home, back to normal.

The production staff of ''The Simpsons'' had entertained the thought of a film since early in the series, but things never came together.

===Animation===
The film was animated at four different studios around the world: [[Film Roman]] in [[Burbank, California]]; [[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[Glendale, California]]; and [[AKOM]] and Rough Draft Korea in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. Like the television series, the storyboarding, character and background layout, and animatic part of production was done in America, with the overseas studios completing the [[tweening|inbetweening]] and [[digital ink and paint]] process.<ref name="credits">{{cite web|url=http://www.uloc.de/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?News/OFFFilmCredits|title=Credits|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=ULOC}}</ref> In addition to Silverman's directing, sequence directors [[Mike B.

Animation for the film began in January 2006.<ref name="pig feces"/> Groening rejected making either a [[live action]] or a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film,<ref name="totalfilm"/> describing the film's animation as being "deliberately imperfect", and "a tribute to the art of hand-drawn animation, which is basically disappearing."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6273738.stm|title='Clumsy' Simpsons movie promised|accessdate=2007-07-05|date=[[2007-07-05]]|author=Neil Smith|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The film was animated in a wider [[anamorphic format|2.39:1]] aspect ratio than the television series,<ref name=officialsite/> and colored with the largest palette the animators ever had available to them.<ref name=creators/> [[David Silverman]] said that unlike the TV series where "you've got to pick and choose," the film allowed the opportunity to "lavish that attention with every single scene that we do," also noting that the characters have shadows.<ref name=nytimes/> Silverman and the animators looked to ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Les Triplettes de Belleville|Triplets of Belleville]]'', and ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' for inspiration as they were "a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed".<ref name=nytimes/> They also looked at ''[[Dumbo]]'' and the [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] cartoon ''Pluto's Judgement Day'' for a dream sequence,<ref name="totalfilm"/> and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' for crowd scenes.<ref name=moviesonline/> Silverman also looked at some of the episodes he had directed, primarily his two favorites "[[Homie the Clown]]" and "[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]".<ref name=silvermaninter>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2280|title=Interview: 'SIMPSONS MOVIE' DIRECTOR DAVID SILVERMAN LOVES MAKING D'OH|accessdate=2007-07-31|date=[[2007-07-31]]|author=Peter Brown|publisher=iF Magazine}}</ref>

Although most animated films cannot make any changes to the story for budget reasons,<ref name="empire"/> ''The Simpsons Movie'' crew continued to keep playing with their film even into 2007.
