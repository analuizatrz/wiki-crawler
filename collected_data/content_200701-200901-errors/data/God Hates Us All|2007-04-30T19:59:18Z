'''''God Hates Us All''''' is the eighth studio album released by the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]. The album was recorded  at the  [[The Warehouse Studio]] in [[Vancouver]]. Following three separate delays arising from artwork and remixing concerns, the album was finally released on [[September 11]], [[2001]], through [[American Recordings]]. 

==Recording==
Slayer began writing lyrics for ''God Hates Us All'' after a long touring cycle ending prior to the 1999 [[Ozzfest]]. However, every three to four months the band were sidetracked by appearances at the Ozzfest, recording a theme song "Here Comes the Pain" for the [[World Championship Wrestling]] wrestler [[Tazz]], and embarking on a worldwide "Tattoo the Earth" tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].<ref name="Hanneman and Araya vs. Toazted"/> Guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] later admitted "that was the last break. Then we got our shit together."<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King">{{cite web|title=Hardcore Sounds interview with Slayer |publisher=Hardcoresounds.net|url=http://www.hardcoresounds.net/modules.php?name=Band_List&file=viewer&func=356
|accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref> The band's producer [[Rick Rubin]] was busy, unable to work with Slayer, and believed he was "burned out" and could not continue to make intense music.<ref name="Hanneman and Araya vs. Toazted">{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref> Rubin recommended two producers, the first producer was not going to work out personality wise according to Hanneman.<ref name="Hanneman and Araya vs. Toazted"/> The band selected the second candidate, Matt Hyde, after they gave him a trial on the song "Bloodline" for the movie ''[[Dracula 2000]]''. Pleased with his work, the band wanted Hyde to produce the entire album.<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King"/> The album was due to be recorded in a [[Hollywood]] studio, however the band decided to record in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]]. This was due to the availability of cheaper studio time, and producer Hyde having previously worked in the studio where his equipment was set up.<ref name="SLAYER Interview With Kerry King">{{cite web|title=SLAYER Interview With Kerry King|author=Luxi Lahtinen and Marko Syrjälä|publisher=Metalrules.com|date=[[2001-10-04]]

''God Hates Us All'' was recorded in Canadian rock singer [[Bryan Adams]]'s [[The Warehouse Studio]]. The studio was altered to make it "feel like home" for Slayer; as opposed to the setting for, in King's words, the "lightweight Canadian pop singer".<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King"/> This consisted of drawing a chalked-out crime-scene of a body on the floor, adding [[incense]] burners, candles, dimmed lights, skulls, and [[pornography]] on the walls. Two banner flags of two middle fingers were also put up, and the first door in the studio had a [[Misfits]] skull which had "Eat a bag" written on it. Vocalist [[Tom Araya]] says "That was basically the attitude of Slayer in the studio. We had a red devil head on one of the speakers. We had a skull on another. That's the kind of shit we put up. Spooky stuff that makes you feel at home."<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King"/>

Hyde used the [[digital audio workstation]] [[Pro Tools]] during the [[sound engineer|engineering]],  [[Record producer|production]], and [[audio mixing]] stages of the album. Slayer members wanted to keep the use of computers to a minimum, only adding a little delay or [[distortion]].<ref name="Hanneman and Araya vs. Toazted"/> As with previous recordings, the Drum tracks were the first to be recorded. Drummer [[Paul Bostaph]] follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin when in the studio: "The perfect take is the one that felt like it was going to fall apart but never did."<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King"/> Utilizing [[seven-string guitar]]s on the tracks "Warzone" and "Here Comes The Pain" was the first time Slayer had done so. King was at the [[B.C. Rich]] guitar company (the company that manufactures his signature model, the [[KKV]]) and decided to borrow a seven string guitar. After writing one song, King ordered one as he thought "there´s no point having one tuning for just one song", so he wrote another; "You don’t have to be good to make up a seven-string riff."<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King"/> Four songs are in drop B tuning and the rest of the album is in D sharp.<ref name="SLAYER Interview With Kerry King"/>

==Lyrical themes==
''God Hates Us All'' explores such themes as murder, revenge, and [[self-control]]. King wrote roughly 80% of the lyrics, which he based on "street" subjects which everyone could relate to, rather than "[[Satan]] this", "Satan that", and "the usual Dungeons and Dragons shit" from the band's previous records.<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King"/> The song "Threshold" deals with reaching your limit with a person in a situation where you’re about to break, you're about to blow-up as they get "under your skin", and "Cast Down" is about a fallen Angel who resorts to drugs.<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King"/>

"God Send Death" is based on a creature that has killed in the past, while "Deviance" takes up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman.<ref name="liveDaily Interview: Slayer"/> Having read several books on [[serial killers]], Hanneman put thought into the lyrics and came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really "pissed him off", unable to kill someone he did not know know just for power. He later remarked that he was "really trying to get into that person's mind. Why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted to get into that mindset."<ref name="liveDaily Interview: Slayer">{{cite web

While other members went to local pubs, Araya spent his free hours reading novels about serial killers, including [[Gordon Burn]]'s ''Happy Like Murderers: The Story of Fred and Rosemary West''.<ref name="Hardcore Sounds interview with Kerry King"/> Araya was seeking inspiration, and aimed to sound convincing while singing the lyrics, avoiding himself to sound like a gimmick. Reviewing for [[Kerrang!]], Jason Arnopp  described the album's lyrics as "so packed with foul and abusive language that it sounds as if [[D-12]] and [[the Sopranos]] family were going head-to-head in a celebrity swearathon."<ref name="KerrangReview">{{cite web|title= God Hates Us All - Review|author=Arnopp, Jason|publisher=[[Kerrang!]]|date=2001-09-10|url= http://www.kerrang.com/nav?page=kerrang.reviews.artist.review&fixture_artist=149178&fixture_review=148225&resource=148225|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref>

==Cover art and album title==
[[Image:Slayer-GodHatesUsAll-WhiteSleeve.jpg|thumb|left|The censored album cover]]
The album was originally going to be called ''Soundtrack to the Apocalypse''. However, Araya suggested ''Soundtrack to the Apocalypse'' would be a better name for a [[box set]], which the band [[Soundtrack to the Apocalypse|released]] in 2003.<ref name="SLAYER INTERVIEW - TOM ARAYA">{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> The title ''God Hates Us All'' originated from the song "Disciple" which repeats the line "God Hates Us All" during the chorus, a reference to God allowing things such as suicide and terrorism to happen and doing nothing to prevent it. A member of the heavy metal band [[Pantera]] suggested "God Hates Us All" for a shirt design after King played "Disciple" to the band. King thought it was a great idea, and used it for the title.<ref name="An Interview with Kerry King, Founder, Lead Guitarist, and All-Around Headbanger">{{cite web

The original album cover depicted a [[Bible]] covered in blood, with nails pushed in, and "Slayer" burnt on it. The liner notes feature [[Bible verse]]s crossed out with a black marker. The idea was suggested by the band's record company, though King wished to have more time to create a better cover.<ref name="The Return of Dave Lombardo"/> King thought the idea "represents a record company with absolutely no idea what the fuck they were going to do", saying the effort "looked like a seventh grader defaced the Bible."<ref name="The Return of Dave Lombardo"/> King's concept for the cover was to insert nails in a shape of a [[pentagram]], and have the nails miss keywords in the Bible verses so it looks like a [[sociopath]] knows where every word in it is.<ref name="The Return of Dave Lombardo">{{cite web|title=The Return of Dave Lombardo|publisher=Recoilmag.com|

A near flawless album," and that Araya's performance possibly makes "the most exhausting Slayer album yet".<ref name="AMG- God Hates Us All">{{cite web

However, Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin was dismissive towards the album labeling it "Another failure on the band's part to take the initiative and reinvent themselves." Krgin responded negatively towards King's lyrical contribution to the album calling him the weaker song writer of the group, and called Araya's vocal performance "hollow shell of his former self, boasting a singing style that is monotonous, devoid of creativity and at times virtually unlistenable." Krgin awarded it 6 out of 10 ending the review with "Slayer's rapidly diminishing record sales (''Diabolus In Musica'' has shifted less than 300,000 copies in the US compared to ''[[Seasons In The Abyss]]'' 600-700,000+) as a sign that the band is in dire need of a new lease on life."<ref name="SLAYER God Hates Us All (American) ">{{cite web

The single "Disciple" received a [[Grammy]] nomination for "[[Best Metal Performance]]" at the [[44th Grammy Awards]], the band's first nomination.

Following the tour, the band continued their search for a permanent drummer, and sought solicitation via demo tape and [[snail mail]].
