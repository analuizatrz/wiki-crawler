'''Christian Klien''' (born [[Hohenems]], [[February 7]] [[1983]]) is an [[Austria|Austrian]] [[Formula One]] racing driver. Klien has yet to achieve a race win or a podium finish in Formula One. 

Klien started his career in motorsport in his early teens; racing in karting championships both in Austria and [[Switzerland]] before moving up to [[Formula BMW]]. After several more titles in lower Formulas, Klien moved up into [[Formula One]] with the [[Jaguar Racing]] team, alongside [[Mark Webber]]. At the end of 2004, Jaguar's Formula One team was sold to [[Red Bull]] and renamed ''[[Red Bull Racing]]''; Klien shared the race seat with [[Italy|Italian]] [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]]. The Austrian stayed at Red Bull for [[2006 Formula One season|2006]], with Liuzzi going to Red Bull junior team, [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]].

After an unsuccessful 2006, it was announced that Klien's old teammate Mark Webber would replace him for the [[2007 Formula One season|2007 season]]. Klien was offered a few alternatives to Formula One for 2007, including a drive in the [[ChampCar]] series, but Klien refused and aimed for a drive in Formula One. He was eventually given a test driver role at [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] despite competition from other drivers, including the likes of [[Gary Paffett]].

==Personal and early life==
Christian Klien was born on [[February 7]], [[1983]] in [[Hohenems]], in the [[Austria]]n [[Alps]] to Herma and Hennes Klien. Klien has a sister called Carina. 

==Racing career==
===Pre-Formula One===
Klien became enthused about racing when his dad brought him to watch a [[Go-Kart]] race. This enthusiasm for the sport was only increased after meeting [[Brazil|Brazilian]] [[Formula One]] driver [[Ayrton Senna]]. The [[Austria]]n started his career at the age of 13.<ref name="GP Encyclopedia">''[http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-12489.html GP Encyclopedia > Christian Klien]'' GrandPrix.com. Retrieved 22 November 2006</ref> From 1996 to 1998, Klien won several [[kart racing|kart]] races in both [[Switzerland]] and his native [[Austria]], becoming the Suisse champion in his first year. 

In 1999, Klien moved to racing in the [[Formula BMW]] ADAC Junior Cup, winning four races and finishing fourth in the series.<ref name="GP Encyclopedia" /> The following year, he moved into the main Formula BMW ADAC Championship with Team Rosberg, finishing the series ranked tenth overall and third in the rookie rankings.<ref name="GP Encyclopedia" /> Continuing in the series in 2001, Klien managed to win five races, and ended up third in the series.<ref name="GP Encyclopedia" /> Joining JD Motorsport for the [[Italy|Italian]] winter [[Formula Renault]] series, he won one event, which lead to a drive for the team in German Formula Renault for 2002.<ref name="GP Encyclopedia" />

Klien won four races, winning the German title, and finishing fifth in the European series. From there, Klien moved into the [[Formula Three Euroseries]], with Mucke Motorsport, winning four races and finishing runner-up to [[Ryan Briscoe]]. Klien also won the 2003 Marlboro Masters event at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]].<ref name="GP Encyclopedia" />

===Formula One===
====2004: Jaguar====
{{mainarticle|Jaguar Racing}}
In [[December 2003]], Klien was signed as a race driver for the [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]] [[Formula One]] team for the [[2004 Formula One season|2004 season]],<ref>''[http://www.formula1.com/news/1068.html "Klien clinches Jaguar race seat for 2004"]'' Official Formula One Website.

Retrieved 22 November 2006</ref> He had significant pressure on him as second driver to his more experienced teammate [[Mark Webber]], but was the first driver to ever outqualify Webber from the same team. 

Klien proved to be considerably reliable over the season, retiring only on 4 occasions out of the possible 18. Klien's only points scoring finish in his debut season came in [[2004 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], where Klien finished sixth; scoring 3 Championship points. He finished alongside [[Cristiano da Matta]] and [[Nick Heidfeld]] in joint 16th in the Drivers' Championship.

====2005-2006: Red Bull Racing====

Jaguar were bought out in [[November 2004]] by Austrian [[energy drink]] company [[Red Bull]] and were renamed "Red Bull Racing".<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4012381.stm "Red Bull snaps up Jaguar F1 team"]'' [[BBC Sport]]. Retrieved 23 November 2006</ref> During winter testing in 2005, Klien tested several times for [[Red Bull Racing]] alongside [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]] and [[David Coulthard]]. Klien secured the second race seat at Red Bull, alongside the veteran Coulthard. Klien started the year with points finishes in the first two races before retiring in [[2005 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] before the race had even started due to an electrical problem. 

With both Klien and Liuzzi signed to race for the Red Bull team in 2005, Red Bull announced that Liuzzi would be racing at the next 4 rounds in [[2005 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]], [[Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and the [[European Grand Prix|European Grands Prix]] instead of Klien.<ref>''[http://www.formula1.com/news/2824.html "Imola race chance for Liuzzi"]'' Official Formula One Website. Retrieved 22 November 2006</ref> Originally, Klien was ineligible to be a third driver at these Grand Prix, as he had competed in over six Grand Prix the previous year, but after a majority of teams asked the FIA to remove this ruling, Klien was allowed to take this role at Imola.<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4433707.stm "Red Bull secure Klien exemption"]'' [[BBC Sport]]. Retrieved 23 November 2006</ref>

The Austrian returned to the race seat for the [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] and maintained his race seat thanks to his strong performances and Red Bull's increased number of seats from the purchase of the [[Minardi]] team in 2006.<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4227936.stm "Red Bull swoop for Minardi deal"]'' [[BBC Sport]]. Retrieved 23 November 2006</ref> Klien finished his second year in Formula One with two further points finishes: an 8th place finish in [[2005 Turkish Grand Prix|Turkey]] and a 5th at the season-finale in [[2005 Chinese Grand Prix|China]]. After a promising performance in China, it was confirmed in [[December 2005]] that Klien would drive for the Red Bull Racing outfit alongside [[David Coulthard]] for the 2006 season.

[[Image:Coulthard cheste 2006-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Klien testing the Red Bull RB2 at [[Circuit de Valencia]] in [[February 2006]].]]
Klien started 2006 strongly, qualifying in the top 10 for the first 2 races of the season. In [[2006 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] he finished 8th, scoring a point. However, in [[2006 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] he collided with [[Kimi Räikkönen]] on the first lap and had to pit with suspension damage, before eventually dropping out with a hydraulic failure.

In 2006, Klien was unsuccessful in comparison to his more experienced teammate David Coulthard, as the Brit scored the team's first podium and was more consistent then Klien throughout the season. In [[August 2006]], it was confirmed that Klien would not stay with the Red Bull team for he upcoming [[2007 Formula One season|2007 season]], or at least as a race driver, due to Red Bull's signing of [[Mark Webber]].<ref>''[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17293.html "Webber confirmed at Red Bull"]'' GrandPrix.com. Retrieved 23 November 2006</ref> After the 2 points finishes in Bahrain and [[2006 German Grand Prix|Germany]], there was some uncertainty as to where Klien would go next in his racing career, speculation suggested America as a logical choice for the Austrian, but he refused a [[ChampCar]] seat in a Red Bull-backed team for 2007, preferring to chase a Formula One drive with another team.<ref>''[http://www.formula1.com/news/4965.html "Matador no more - Klien bids Red Bull farewell"]'' Official Formula One Website. Retrieved 23 November 2006</ref> As a result, the team announced that Klien had been dropped for the last three races of the season in favour of test driver [[Robert Doornbos]].<ref>''[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17444.html "Klien out, Doornbos in at Red Bull Racing"]'' GrandPrix.com.
