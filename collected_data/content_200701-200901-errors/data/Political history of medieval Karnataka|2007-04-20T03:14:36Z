The '''Political history of medieval Karnataka''' spans from the fourth to the sixteenth centuries C.E. when those empires that emerged from the Karnataka region of [[India]] made a lasting impact on modern [[India]]. This era can be broadly divided into several periods. First came the assertion of the earliest native kingdoms and the early imperialism, followed by the  successful domination of the Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of [[Tamilakam]] over the [[Vengi]] region, domination of the southern deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins of the rise of the Karnataka region as an imperialistic power dates back to the fourth century  birth of the [[Kadamba Dynasty]] of [[Banavasi]], the earliest of the native rulers to come to power and who gave administrative powers for the first time to the language of [[Kannada]], the language of the soil, in addition to the official [[Sanskrit]]. This is the  historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geo-political entity and of Kannada as an important regional language.

In the southern regions of Karnataka, the [[Gangas]] of [[Talakad]] were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas were followed by the imperial dynasties of the [[Badami Chalukyas]], the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]], the [[Western Chalukya Empire]], the [[Hoysala Empire]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], all giving ample patronage to the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from the west. The Muslim invasion of the deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the fourteenth century. The rule of the [[Bahamani Sultanate]] of [[Bidar]] and the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] from the northern deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. Ably serving these large empires and upholding the local culture and traditions were the local hereditary ruling families and clans.

The fourth century beginning of [[Kadamba Dynasty]] of [[Banavasi]], identified the Karnataka region as  an independent political entity and Kannada as an administrative language from the middle of 5th century onwards.<ref name="first">From the Halmidi inscription (Ramesh 1984, pp10-11)</ref> The Kadambas were natives of the Talagunda region (in modern [[Shivamogga district]]) as proven by inscriptions.<ref name="first1">The Kadambas were Kanarese speaking dravidians inducted into the Brahmin fold (Moraes 1931, p11)</ref><ref name="first2">Their local tribal origins is attested by the Talagunda inscription, R.N.

The fact that the Kadambas cultivated marital ties with the imperial [[Vakatakas]] and [[Gupta]] dynasties attests to their power.<ref name="vaka">Moraes (1931), p26</ref> [[Kakusthavarma]], the most powerful ruler of the dynasty who has been described as "ornament of the Kadamba family"  and "Sun among the kings of wide spread flame", gave one daughter in marriage to Vakataka Narendrasena  and another to Skanda Gupta, grandson of Chandra Gupta II of the Gupta dynasty.<ref name="marriage">From the Talagunda inscription (Moraes 1931, pp26-27)</ref><ref name="marraige1">From the Balaghat inscription of Vakataka Prithvisena (Kamath 2001, p33)</ref> Historians trace their rise to political power through the examination of the contemporaneous Sanskrit writing, ''Aichitya Vichara Charcha'' by Kshemendra, which quotes portions of ''Kunthalesvara Dautya'' by the famous poet [[Kalidasa]]. Here Kalidasa describes his visit to the Kadamba kingdom as an ambassador where he was not offered a seat in the court of the Kadamba king and had to sit on the ground. Historians view this act as one of assertion by the Kadambas who considered themselves equal to the imperial Gupta dynasty.<ref name="equal">Moraes, Desai and Panchamukhi in Kamath (2001), p33</ref> 

Family feuds and conflicts ended the Kadamba rule in the middle of sixth century when the last Kadamba ruler Krishna Varma II was subdued by Pulakesi I of the Chalukya feudatory, ending their sovereign rule. The Kadambas would continue to rule parts of Karnataka and Goa for many centuries to come but never again as an independent kingdom.<ref name="sov">Kamath (2001), p35</ref> Some historians view the Kadambas as the originators of the Karnataka architectural tradition although there were also elements in common with the structures  built by the contemporaneous Pallavas of Kanchi.<ref name="tradition">Moraes in Kamath (2001), p37</ref> The oldest surviving Kadamban structure is one dating to late fifth century in Halsi in modern [[Belgaum district]]. The most prominent feature of their architectural style, one that remained popular centuries later and was used by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar kings, is the ''Kadamba Shikara'' (Kadamba tower) with a ''Kalasa'' (pot) on top.<ref name="kalasa">Kamath (2001), p38</ref>

The [[Western Ganga Dynasty]], contemporaries of the Kadambas, came to power from [[Kolar]] but in the fifth century moved their capital to [[Talakadu]]  in modern [[Mysore district]].<ref name="my">Kamath (2001), p40</ref> They ruled the region historically known as Gangavadi comprising most of the modern southern districts of Karnataka.

The Gangas continued to rule as feudatories till the beginning of the eleventh century when they were defeated by the [[Cholas]] of [[Tanjore]]. Important figures among the Gangas were King [[Durvinita]], admired as an able warrior and an early writer in the Kannada language,<ref name="durva">Narasimhacharya (1988), p2</ref> King [[Shivamara II]] and minister [[Chavundaraya]], both known to be courageous warriors and writers in Kannada and Sanskrit.<ref name="chavunda">Narasimhacharya (1988), p18</ref><ref name="war">Kamath (2001), p50</ref> The most important architectural contributions of the Gangas are the monuments and [[Basadi]]s of [[Shravanabelagola]], the [[monolith]] of [[Gomateshwara]], termed as the mightiest achievement in the field of sculpture in ancient Karnataka, and the Basadi at [[Kambadahalli]].<ref name="contri">Kamath (2001), pp51-52</ref> Their free standing pillars (called ''Mahasthambhas'' and ''Brahmasthambhas'') are also considered a unique contribution.<ref name="maha">Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p52</ref>

The [[Chalukya dynasty]], natives of the [[Aihole]] and [[Badami]] regions in Karnataka, were at first the feudatories of the Kadambas.<ref name="natives">N. Laxminarayana Rao and S. C. Nandinath in Kamath 2001, p57</ref><ref name="natives1">Keay (2000), p168</ref>

During the rule of [[Pulakesi II]]  a south Indian empire sent expeditions past the [[Tapti River]] and [[Narmada River]] for the first time and successfully defied Harshavardhana, the King of Northern India (''Uttarapatheswara''). The [[Aihole]] inscription of Pulakesi II, written in classical Sanskrit language and old Kannada script dated 634,<ref name="mix">In this composition, the poet deems himself an equal to Sanskrit scholars of lore like Bharavi and Kalidasa (Sastri 1955, p312</ref><ref name="mix1">Kamath (2001), p59</ref> proclaims his victories against the kingdoms of Kadambas, [[Gangas]], [[Alupas]] of South Canara, Mauryas of [[Puri]], Kingdom of Kosala, [[Malwa]], [[Gujarat|Lata]] and Gurjaras of southern Rajasthan and describes how King Harsha of [[Kannauj]] lost his ''Harsha'' (joyful disposition) on seeing a large number of his war elephants die in battle against Pulakesi II.<ref name="aihole">Keay (2000), p169</ref><ref name="aihole1">Kamath (2001), pp59-60</ref><ref name="fear">Some of these kingdoms may have submitted out of fear of Harshavardhana of Kannauj (Majumdar in Kamat 2001, p59)</ref><ref name="fear1">The rulers of Kosala were the Panduvamshis of South Kosala (Sircar in Kamath 2001, pp59)</ref> 

These victories earned him the title ''Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy'' (lord of the south). Pulakesi II continued his conquests in the east where he conquered all kingdoms in his way and reached the [[Bay of Bengal]] in present day Orissa. A Chalukya vice royalty was set up in Gujarat and Vengi (coastal Andhra) and princes from the Badami family were dispatched to rule over them.

In the middle of eight century  the Chalukya rule was ended when they were invaded by their feudatory, the Rashtrakuta family rulers of [[Berar]] (in present day [[Amravati district]] of [[Maharashtra]]). Sensing an opportunity during a weak period in the Chalukya rule, [[Dantidurga]] trounced the great Chalukyan "Karnatabala" (power of Karnata).<ref name="bala">From the Rashtrakuta inscriptions (Kamath 2001, p57, p64)</ref><ref name="bala1">The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that feudatory Dantidurga defeated the Chalukyas and humbled their great Karnatik army (referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas) (Reu 1933, p54)</ref> Having overthrown the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas  made their capital at [[Manyakheta]] (modern Malkhed in [[Gulbarga district]].<ref name="manya">A capital which could put to shame even the capital of gods-From Karda plates (Altekar 1934, p47)</ref><ref name="manya1">A capital city built to excel that of Indra (Sastri, 1955, p4, p132, p146)</ref> Although the origins of the early Rashtrakuta ruling families in central India and the Deccan in the sixth and seventh centuries is controversial, during the eighth through the tenth centuries they emphasised the importance of the Kannada language in conjunction with Sanskrit.

In the early thirteenth century, with the Hoysala power remaining unchallenged in the southern Deccan,  the first of the [[Muslim]] incursions into South India began. After two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the  Hoysala ruler at the time, [[Veera Ballala III]], died in the battle of [[Madurai]] in 1343, resulting in the merger of the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by [[Harihara I]], founder of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] located in the Tungabhadra region in present day Karnataka. The new kingdom, building its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]] on the banks of the [[Tungabhadra River]], thrived.<ref name="origin">Two theories exist about the origin of Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I. One states that they were Kannadiga commanders of the Hoysala army and another that they were commanders of the earlier Kakatiya Kingdom (Kamath 2001, pp 159-160)</ref>

The Vijayanagara Empire quickly rose to imperial status as early as the late fourteenth century. During the reign of [[Bukka Raya I]], the island of [[Sri Lanka|Lanka]] paid tributes and ambassadors were exchanged with the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China.<ref name="ming">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p241</ref><ref name="ming2">Indicated by records of the Ming dynasty (Kamath 2001, p162)</ref> The  empire's most famous rulers were [[Deva Raya II]] and the  [[Tuluva]] King [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Deva Raya II (''Gajabetekara'' or hunter of elephants) succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was the most  effective of the [[Sangama Dynasty|Sangama dynasty]] rulers.<ref name="deva">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p244</ref> He quelled rebelling feudal lords, the Zamorin of Calicut and the Quilon in the south, and invaded the island of [[Sri Lanka|Lanka]] while becoming overlord of the kings of [[Burma]] at Pegu and Tanasserim.<ref name="deva1">From the notes of Persian Abdur Razzak. Writings of Nuniz confirms that the kings of Burma paid tributes to Vijayanagara empire (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p245)</ref><ref name="deva2">Kamath (2001), p164</ref> The empire reached its peak in early sixteenth century during the rule of [[Krishnadevaraya]] when the Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south.<ref name="deva6">The notes of Portuguese Barbosa during the time of Krishnadevaraya confirms a very rich and well provided Vijayanagara city (Kamath 2001, p186)</ref>

Many important monuments at [[Hampi]] were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishnadevaraya. The enduring legacy of this empire is the vast open air theatre of monuments at their regal capital, [[Vijayanagara]], a the UNESCO World Heritage site. [[Vijayanagara Architecture|Vijayanagara architecture]] is a vibrant combination of the Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles, idioms that had prospered in previous centuries.<ref name="art">Art critic, Percy Brown calls Vijayanagar architecture a blossoming of Dravidian style, Kamath, p182</ref> In a prolific age of literature in Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit, the Telugu language also attained its height in popularity reaching its peak under the patronage of Krishnadevaraya.<ref name="deva7">Kamath (2001), pp181-182</ref> With the demise of the Vijayanagara Empire after a major defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by the Deccan sultanates, the Karnataka region and South India became fragmented and subsumed under the rule of various former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire. A diminished Vijayanagara Empire now moved its capital to Penukonda in modern Andhra Pradesh and later to Chandragiri and Vellore before disintegrating. In the coastal and south Karnataka region, the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and  the [[Keladi Nayaka]] of Shimoga were the main rulers while the northern regions  were under the control of the Adilshah Sultanate.<ref name="break">Kamath (2001), p174</ref> The Nayaka kingdom lasted into the 18th century before merging with the Kingdom of Mysore. The Mysore Kingdom remained a princely state until Indian Independence in 1947 even though they came under the British Raj in 1799 after the death of Tipu Sultan.

==Bahamani Sultanate==
The [[Bahmani Sultanate]], contemporay to the Vijayanagara Empire, was founded in 1347 by Alla-ud-din-Hasan, a breakaway commander from the armies of the northern invaders led by [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Mohammed-bin-Tughlaq]].  [[Gulbarga]] was the initial capital, later moved further north to Bidar.<ref name="bin">Kamath (2001), p190</ref> The first of the Muslim invasions to the Deccan came in the early decades of the fourteenth century. At its peak, the Bahamani kingdom extended its territories from the the [[Krishna River]] in the south to [[Penganga River]] in the north, thus covering the regions in modern northern Karnataka, of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The most notable of the Bahamani Kings was Firuz Shah who ruled from 1397 to 1422.<ref name="firuz">Kamath (2001), p191</ref> Militarily, the rule of Firuz Shah had uneven success  against the Vijayanagara kings while he was more convincingly successful against  the Kherla rulers of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and the Vema Redies of [[Rajamundry]], areas that he annexed in 1417. His last encounter with the Vijayanagara armies in 1417 was disastrous and led to his defeat, ill health and ultimate death in 1422.<ref name="firuz"/> 

Contemporary writers, such as Tabataba in his writings, have heaped praise on Firuz Shah. Tabataba wrote of the king as, "[a]n impetuous, mighty monarch who patronised learned men, Sheiks and hermits", while Shirazi described him as "a just, pious and generous king and one without equal".<ref name="shirazi">Kamath (2001), p192</ref> In the opinion of one historian, Firuz Shah was one of the most notable Sultans to rule in India.<ref name="shah">sinha in Kamath (2001), p192</ref> Another well known figure from this kingdom was Kwaja Mahamud Gavan, the prime minister, who served under several kings and regents. He rose above the kings and princess of the dynasty by virtue of his ministerial, administrative, martial, literary and philanthrophic abilities. A Persian and a visitor to Bidar in 1445, he impressed the ruling Sultan Alla-ud-din II and was chosen to become a minister in his court.<ref name="gavan">Kamath (2001), p195</ref> As a commander he was able to extend the kingdom from [[Hubli]] in the south to Goa in the west and Kondavidu and Rajamahendri in the east. He soon rose to the position of prime minister (''Vakil-Us-Sultanat'').

The Bahamanis introduced large scale use of paper for administrative use and begain the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style (also known as Deccani architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka.<ref name="gavan1">Kamath (2001), p197</ref> The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The Bande Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid with its Spanish influence in Gulbarga are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish and Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example).<ref name="turk">Kamath (2001), p198</ref> Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal,  Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal are some of the palaces built by them that have retained their beauty. The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor and the school of learning (''madrasa'') built by Gavan in Bidar are also famous.<ref name="tomb">Kamath (2001), p199</ref> In the later part of 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the ''Pardeshi'' Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom bringing about its end in 1527.<ref name="end">Kamath (2001), p194</ref>

==Bijapur Sultanate==
[[Image:GolGumbaz2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gol Gumbaz]] at [[Bijapur]]]]
The [[Bijapur Sultanate]] (or Adilshahi Kingdom) came into existance with the weakening of the Bahamani Kingdom towards the end of the fifteenth century. The main sources of information about this kingdom comes from  contemporeneous inscriptions and writings in Persian and Kannada, travelogues of european visitors to the deccan and inscriptions of neighbouring kingdoms.<ref name="bija">Kamath (2001), p200</ref> Yusuf Adilkhan, a [[Turkish]] general in the Bahamani army broke waya to originate the kingdom from modern Bijapur in 1489. Thrughout its rule, the Sultanate was at war with the Vijayanagara Empire over the strategic [[Raichur]] doab, the Portuguese over [[Goa]], the Barid Shahis of Bidar and later with the erstwhile feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire who had gaine independence after 1565. The [[Italy|Italian]] writer Varathema wrote about the founder Adilkhan and Bijapur, "A powerful and prosperous king", "the city was encircled by many fortifications and contained beautiful and majestic buildings".<ref name="bija"/>

Inter-Sultanate marraiges normalised relations and Ali I (1557 - 1580) took sides with a confideracy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565.<ref name="conf">Kamath (2001), p201</ref> The most notable ruler of the dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580 - 1626). He was only a mere lad of nine when he came to power when the kingdom was run by the Chandbibi, the king's aunt who acted as regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by the first of Mogul incursions into the deccan, he gave his daughter in marraige to Daniyal, a son of Emperor [[Akhbar]], but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire.<ref name="erst">Kamath (2001), p202</ref> According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate.<ref name="high">Sinha in Kamath (2001), p2002</ref> A tolerant king inclined to the fine arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called ''Kitab-e-Nauras'' is ascribed to him. The opening song in the book is an invocation of the Hindu Goddess [[Saraswathi]].<ref name="erst"/> During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from [[Ahmadnagar]] joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaings in the southern deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from [[Vellore]] came during these campaigns.<ref name="camp">Kamath (2001), p203</ref> 

However, the rise of [[Maratha]] [[Shivaji]] and constant invasions by the [[Moguls]] from the north took its toll bringing to an end the kingdom in the later part of seventeenth century. The contributions of the Bijapur Sultanate to the architectural landscape of Karnataka in the Indo-Saracenic idiom is praiseworthy. Their most famous monuments are the mausoleums called Ibrahim Rauza and the [[Gol Gumbaz]] as well as many palaces and mosques.<ref name="gol">Kamath (2001), p207</ref> The elegance, finish and beauty of Mehtar Mahal is claimed by a historian to be equal to anything in [[Cairo]].<ref name="cairo"> Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p207</ref> Their Kali Masjid at [[Lakshmeshwar]] is a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim styles. The Ibrahim Rauza built by Ibrahim II is a combination of a mausoleum and a mosque and is called the [[Taj Mahal]] of the deccan.<ref name="taj">Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p208</ref> The [[Gol Gumbaz]] built by Muhammad is the fourth largest dome in the world and the largest in India with an impressive "whispering gallery". Its is considered one of the architectural marvels of the world.<ref name="gumbuz">Kamath (2001), p209</ref> Persian language was given state patronage while the use of the local languages, Kannada and Marathi was popularised in local affairs.<ref name="localaffairs">Kamath (2001), p206</ref>

==Immigrants from Karnataka==
In addition to these empires who ruled from the Karnataka region, based on inscriptions and literary evidence historians have discussed and debated the possibility that kingdoms of Kannada origin were established in other parts of India as well.
