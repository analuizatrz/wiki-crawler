{{Politics of Canada}}
{{dablink|The Canadian Monarchy is a [[personal union|shared monarchy]].  This article describes the Monarchy from the perspective of [[Canada]]. In the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, the constitutional role of the Monarchy is similar, but the historical and cultural significance may differ. For information on the Monarchy in the other Realms, see [[Monarchy in Canada#See also|Other Realms]].}}

'''[[Canada]]''' is a '''[[constitutional monarchy]]''' and a [[Commonwealth Realm]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[Queen regnant|reigning monarch]], since [[February 6]], [[1952]]. As such she is Canada's [[head of state]] and officially called [[Queen of Canada]]. The current Canadian [[monarchy]] can trace its ancestral lineage back to the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Merovingian]] periods, and ultimately back to the [[List of kings of the Angles|kings of the Angles]], the early [[Kingdom of Scotland |Scottish kings]], and the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom of [[Clovis I]]. Parts of the territories that today comprise Canada were claimed under King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1534, while others were claimed by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1583. Throughout the 18th century, via war and treaties, the [[New France|Canadian colonies of France]] were ceeded to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].  The [[Canadian Confederation|colonies were confederated]] by Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in 1867 to form [[Canada]], and the country was proclaimed a fully independent [[kingdom]], via [[Constitution Act, 1982|constitutional patriation]], by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 1982.

Most of the Queen's powers in Canada are exercised by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], though she does hold several powers that are hers alone. The Governor General is sometimes referred to as Canada's [[de facto head of state|''de facto'' head of state]].<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/governor_general/role_e.asp Governor General: Role]</ref>

The Queen is the only member of the Canadian Royal Family with any constitutional role; she, her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], their son [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]], and other members of the Royal Family, including the Queen's other children and cousins, undertake various public ceremonial functions across Canada and abroad.

==Constitutional monarchy in Canada==

===International and domestic aspects===
The Canadian Monarchy is a shared monarchy, meaning Canada is in a [[personal union]] relationship.

Fifty-three states are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Sixteen of these countries are specifically [[Commonwealth Realm]]s who recognize, individually, the same person as their Monarch and [[Head of State]]; Canada is one of these. Despite sharing the same person as their respective national monarch, each of the Commonwealth Realms &mdash; including Canada &mdash; is sovereign and independent of the others.

====Development of shared monarchy====
The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] provided the [[dominion]]s the right to be considered equal to Britain, rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operates independently in each Realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the [[Dominion]]s were secondary. The Monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called "British" since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, legal, and of convenience. The [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]] was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]].

Under the Statute of Westminster, Canada has a common monarchy with Britain and the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, and though laws governing the line of succession to the Canadian throne lie within the control of the Canadian Parliament, Canada cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment. This situation applies symmetrically in all the other Realms, including the UK. These concepts were reasserted by Justice Rouleau in a 2003 [[O'Donohue v. Canada|court ruling]] in which he wrote that "Union under the... Crown together with other Commonwealth countries [is a] constitutional principle."<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O’Donohue v. Canada, 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.)]</ref>

On all matters of the Canadian State, the Monarch is advised solely by Canadian federal and provincial [[Minister (government)|minister]]s. Effective with the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], no British or other Realm government can advise the Monarch on any matters pertinent to Canada.<ref>In 1997, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] intended to offer a [[Life Peer]]age to Canadian businessman [[Conrad Black]]. Citing the 1919 [[Nickle Resolution]], the Canadian government advised the Queen that they have objected to such honours for many years. If Blair had not backed down, the Queen would have been in the situation of having to grant an [[honour]] on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and to object to the same as Queen of Canada on the advice of then Prime Minister of Canada [[Jean Chrétien]]. The problem was resolved when Black renounced his Canadian citizenship. Canada raised no further objections and he was granted his peerage, becoming Lord Black of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Crossharbour]].</ref>
{{See|Queen's Privy Council for Canada}}

====Title====
{{Main|Style of the Canadian Sovereign}}
In Canada, the Queen's official title is:
* In [[English language|English]]: ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]].''
* In [[French language|French]]: ''{{lang|fr|Elizabeth Deux, par la grâce de Dieu, Reine du Royaume-Uni, du Canada et de ses autres royaumes et territoires, Chef du Commonwealth, Défenseur de la Foi}}.''

This style communicates Canada's status as an independent monarchy, highlighting the Monarch's role specifically as Queen of Canada, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the Realms, by mentioning Canada separately from the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth Realms. Typically, the Sovereign is styled "Queen of Canada," and is addressed as such when in Canada, or performing duties on behalf of Canada abroad.

Although the Queen's Canadian titles include "[[Defender of the Faith]]/''{{lang|fr|Défenseur de la Foi}}''," neither the Queen nor any of the Governors has any religious role in Canada; there have been no [[established church]]es in Canada since before [[Canadian Confederation|confederation]].

====Finance====
Contrary to common misconception, Canadians do not pay any money to the Queen, either for personal income or to support the royal residences outside of Canada. Only when the Queen is in Canada, or acting abroad as Queen of Canada, does any Canadian government support her in the performance of her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the [[Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]].<ref name="CCC">[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: $1.10 per Canadian'']</ref>

Provincial and federal records of expenditures associated with the Crown are kept, but no official report on the cost of the monarchy to Canadians is compiled. However, every three years the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] issues a survey, based on various federal and provincial government budgets, expenditures and estimates, that outlines a yearly cost for the functioning of the Crown. The 2005 survey found that the institution cost Canadians roughly $49 million in 2004.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/Report.pdf ''$1.53 per Canadian: The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy, 2005'']</ref> Previous surveys found that the overall cost of the Canadian Crown was $22 million in 1999<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costs.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: 74 Cents per Canadian'']</ref> and $34 million in 2002.<ref name="CCC" /><ref>[http://members.tripod.com/~constantian/expense2.html The Constantian Society. The [[Constantian Society]]'s detailed comparison of the costs of monarchies versus [[republic]]s.]</ref> (This does not take into account the inflation of the [[Canadian Dollar]] over these years).

Usually the Queen's Canadian governments pay only for the costs associated with the Governor General and Lieutenant Governors in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonial occasions, etc.<ref name="CCC" />

====Succession====
The [[heir apparent]] is Elizabeth II's eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]].<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/english.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Prince of Wales Royal Visit]</ref>  The [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] is expected to proclaim him [[Style of the Canadian Sovereign|King of Canada]] upon his accession to the Throne upon the [[demise of the Crown]].

Succession to the throne is by [[primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]], and governed by the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701|''Act of Settlement'']], as well as the [[Bill of Rights 1689|English ''Bill of Rights'']]. These documents, though originally passed by the [[Parliament of England]], are now part of Canadian constitutional law, under control of the Canadian parliament only. As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a consitutional amendment.

This legislation restricts the succession to the natural (i.e. non-[[adoption|adopted]]), legitimate descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]] (1630–1714), a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James I]], and lays out the rules that the Monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]], nor married to one, and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne, a provision that has led to [[O'Donohue v. Canada|a legal challenge]].  As Canada's laws governing succession are currently identical to those of the United Kingdom (by the ''Statute of Westminster'') see [[Succession to the British Throne]] for more information.

Upon a "demise in the Crown" (the death of a Sovereign) his or her heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony. (Hence arises the phrase "[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]") Nevertheless, it is customary for the accession of the Sovereign to be publicly proclaimed by the Queen's Privy Council, that meets at [[Rideau Hall]]. After an appropriate period of mourning has passed, the Sovereign is also [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], normally by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. A coronation is not necessary for a Sovereign to rule; for example, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short reign.

After an individual ascends the Throne, he or she continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; the only Canadian monarch to abdicate, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], did so with the authorisation of a special Act of Canadian Parliament, the ''[[Succession to the Throne Act]]''.

===Constitutional role===
[[Image:EIIR-Canadian Parliament.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] reads the [[Throne Speech]] in a joint session of the [[Canadian Parliament]], 1977, accompanied by her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].]]

[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Canadian in origin, which gives Canada a similar parliamentary system of government as the other Commonwealth Realms.  All powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the Monarch, who is represented at the federal level by the [[Governor General of Canada]] — appointed by the Monarch upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] — and at the provincial level by [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]]s — appointed by the Governor General upon the advice of the Prime Minister, usually in consultation with the relevant provincial premier;<ref>[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/lg.htm McCullough, John; ''Interview with Lieutenant Governor Iona Campagnolo''; April 23, 2004]</ref> the Monarch is informed of the Prime Minister's decision before the Governor General gives Royal Assent.<ref> [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/index-e.asp Forsey, Eugene; ''How Canadians Govern Themselves''; Parliament of Canada]</ref> Most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by these [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] representatives.  As all executive authority is vested in the Sovereign, the insitutions of government are said to act under her authority; hence, between the passage of the ''Statute of Westminster'' in 1931 to the mid-[[1970s]] the government was referred to as "Her Majesty's Government in Canada."<ref name="US">[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=4363 Documents on Canadian External Relations: Chapter VIII: Relations with the United States; Part III]</ref>  Since then, however, though the constitutional arrangements have not changed, the government is more often addressed as "The [[Government of Canada]]."

====Constitutional duties====
The powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the [[Royal Prerogative]], which includes many powers such as the ability to make treaties or send [[ambassador]]s, as well as certain duties such as to defend the realm and to maintain the [[Queen's peace]]. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the Consent of the Crown must be obtained before either House may even debate a bill affecting the Sovereign's prerogatives or interests. Although the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited. For example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an [[Act of Parliament]]. The Royal Prerogative, with respect to domestic affairs, is extensive. The Crown is responsible for the appointment and dismissal of ministers, [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Counsellors]], members of various executive agencies, and other officials. Effectively, however, the appointees are chosen by the Prime Minister, or, for less important offices, by other ministers. In addition, it is the Crown's prerogative to declare war, make peace, and direct the actions of the military, although the Prime Minister holds ''de facto'' decision-making power over the armed forces.  The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the Sovereign or Governor General may negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements; no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the Canada; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Governor General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Canadian [[High Commissioner]]s and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, all Canadian [[passport]]s are issued in the Monarch's name. In Canada major [[public inquiries]] are called [[Royal Commission]]s, and are created by the [[Cabinet]] on behalf of the Monarch through a [[Royal Warrant]].

As the Canadian monarchy is a constitutional one, however, the Monarch's role, and thereby the vice-regent's role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments operate, and the powers that are constitutionally hers are exercised almost wholly upon the advice of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], made up of [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]].  It has been said since the death of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714, the last monarch to head the British cabinet (when almost all of Canada was still French colonial territory), that the monarch "reigns" but does not "rule". In Canada, this has been true since the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ended the reign of Canada's last absolute monarch, King [[Louis XV of France]].

In exceptional circumstances, however, the Monarch or vice-regal has acted against such advice based upon his or her [[reserve power]]s — as when Governor General [[Baron Byng|Julian Byng]] refused a request by Prime Minister [[W.L. Mackenzie King|William Mackenzie King]] for a dissolution of Parliament and call for new elections, resulting in the [[King-Byng Affair]]. Also, [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta]], [[John C. Bowen]], in 1937 refused to grant Royal Assent to three bills passed by [[William Aberhart]]'s [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] government on the [[William Aberhart#Political career|grounds that they were unconstitutional]],<ref>[http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pub/gdbook/Part1/page2.htm The Citizen's Guide to the Alberta Legislature Part I: The Foundation]</ref> and [[Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan]] [[Frank Lindsay Bastedo]] refused Royal Assent to a bill in [[1961]].<ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/PDFs/Monarchy%20in%20Saskatchewan.pdf ''Monarchy in Saskatchewan'']</ref>

There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by the [[Queen regnant|Queen]]. These include: signing the appointment papers of Governors General, the confirmation of awards of Canadian honours, and approving any change in her Canadian title.<ref>[http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=562&FT=yes Speech by Governor General Roland Michener, Nov. 19, 1970]</ref> On occasion the Monarch must personally act directly in [[partisan (political)|partisan]] affairs. For example, this occurred when Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] advised Queen Elizabeth II to expand the number of [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] seats to assure passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|GST]]. The Queen followed his advice, and as such, Mulroney became [[accountability|accountable]] for that [[advice]].

The Sovereign is one of the three components of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]]; the others are the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. It is the prerogative of the Monarch to summon, [[prorogation|prorogue]], and [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolve]] Parliament; each parliamentary session begins with the monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which either the Sovereign of the Governor General reads the [[Speech from the Throne]] in the Senate Chamber, outlining the Government's legislative agenda.

====Provinces====
{{Main|Monarchy in the Canadian provinces}}
Across the country the Canadian Crown is unitary. Under this system the [[Head of State|headship of state]] is not a part of either the federal or provincial jurisdictions. The Queen reigns impartially over the country as a whole; meaning the [[sovereignty]] of the provinces is passed on not by the Governor General or the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], but through the Crown itself.  This means that the Crown is "divided" into eleven legal jurisdictions; into eleven "crowns" - one federal and ten provincial.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/CMN_winter_spring_2003_Update-3.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003]</ref><ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/CMN_winter_spring_2003_Update-3.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003]</ref>

A [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] serves as the Queen's representative in each province, carrying out all the Monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties of state on her behalf.

The [[Commissioner]]s of Canada's territories of [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon]], and [[Northwest Territories]] are appointed by the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]], at the recommendation of the federal [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]]. But as the territories are not sovereign entities, the commissioners are ''not'' representatives of the Sovereign. They receive instruction from the said Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

===Legal role===
All laws in Canada are enacted with the sovereign's, or the vice-regal's signature, though there is some debate{{who}} over whether the monarch is constitutionally allowed to personally grant Royal Assent to provincial bills.  Thus, all bills begin with the phrase "Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows."<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=2604319&file=4 Bill C43: ''An Act to provide for consultations with electors on their preferences for appointments to the Senate'']</ref>  The granting of a signature to a bill is known as [[Royal Assent]]; it and proclamation are required for all acts of Parliament and of the provincial legislatures, usually granted or withheld by the Governor General or Lieutenant-Governor, with the [[Great Seal of Canada]], or the appropriate provincial seal. The Vice-regals may reserve a bill for the Monarch's pleasure, that is to say, allow the Monarch to make a personal decision on the bill. A Lieutenant Governor of a province may similarly defer to the Governor General (who may in turn defer to the Monarch). The Monarch has the power to disallow a bill (within a time limit specified by the Constitution). Recently activists opposed to [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Bill C-38]] lobbied Queen Elizabeth II to disallow the legislation after it was passed by Parliament. However it received Royal Assent from The Right Honourable [[Beverley McLachlin]], Deputy of the Governor General, on [[July 20]], [[2005]]. Territorial legislatures, unlike their provincial counterparts, are subject to the oversight of the Government of Canada.<ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-27/252179.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Northwest Territories Act''; 1985]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Y-2.01/265655.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Yukon Act''; 2000]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-28.6/index.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Nunavut Act''; 1993]</ref>

[[Image:Canadian_Supreme_Court_justices_circa_1950.jpg|right|thumb|In the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is displayed the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]]]]
The Sovereign is deemed the "fount of justice," and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects. The Sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name.  The common law holds that the Sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences.  Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the Monarch personally are not cognizable. In international cases, as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and under established principles of [[international law]], the Queen of Canada is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent.<ref name="US" /> The Sovereign, and by extension the Governor General, also exercises the "prerogative of mercy," and may pardon offences against the Crown. Pardons may be awarded before, during, or after a trial.

In Canada the legal personality of the [[State]] is referred to as "Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada", and likewise for the provinces and territories (i.e., "in Right of Ontario," etc.).<ref>[http://arizonaenergy.org/images/ontario_mou_e.pdf ''Memorandum for Understanding of Cooperation on Addressing Climate Change''; May 21, 2004]</ref> For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the federal government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. The monarch as an individual takes no more role in such an affair than in any other business of government. For example, a case in which a party sues both a province and the federal government, the respondents would formally be called ''Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Saskatchewan and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada''.<ref>[http://www.usask.ca/nativelaw/factums/claim.html Lac La Ronge Indian Band vs. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN In Right of Canada, and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN in Right of the Province of Saskatchewan; Q. B. No. 2655 of 1987]</ref> In this capacity, all [[Crown copyright]] is held by the Queen, either in Right of Canada or a relevant province.<ref>[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/national/can_political_e/map.pdf Natural Resources Canada: Map of Canada]</ref>

In addition, the Monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of Courts of Justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada]] is always displayed in Canadian courtrooms, except in the province of [[British Columbia]] where the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the United Kingdom]] are displayed as a symbol of its judiciary.<ref>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Courts of British Columbia]</ref> [[Itinerant]] judges will display an image of the Queen and the Canadian flag when holding a session away from established courtrooms. Such situations occur in parts of Canada where the stakeholders in a given court case are too isolated geographically to be able to travel for regular proceedings.

===Cultural role===
====Representation of the State====
{{rquote|right|''The Canadian Crown continues as a key element of our parliamentary democracy and an enduring symbol that represents all generations of Canadians and the best that is our country.''<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/53_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: 2005 Royal Visit: The Queen and Canada: 53 Years of Growing Together]</ref>| [[Department of Canadian Heritage]], 2005}}

At one time the Monarchy was considered a purely British institution, when most Canadians still continued to be both legally, and by personal view, British subjects. However, parallelling the changes in constitutional law, and the evolution of Canadian nationalism, the cultural role of the Monarchy in Canada altered.

The federal and provincial governments now recognize and promote the Queen's role as Monarch of Canada as separate to her position as Monarch of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate//Monarchy/SenMonarchy_15-e.htm Canada: a Constitutional Monarchy]</ref><ref>[http://canada.gc.ca/howgoc/queen/quind_e.html Biography: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/protocol/Practice/crown_in_canada.htm Saskatchewan Government Relations: The Crown in Canada]</ref>  Today the Sovereign is regarded as the personification of the Canadian [[state]], and is described by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] as the "personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians."<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf The Crown in Canada]|376&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 385993 bytes -->}}</ref> Elizabeth II stated in 1973:
: "But it is as Queen of Canada that I am here, Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains. I want the Crown to be seen as a symbol of national sovereignty belonging to all. It is not only a link between Commonwealth nations, but between Canadian citizens of every national origin and ancestry."

From time to time the Sovereign or another member of the Royal Family will also represent Canada abroad.  On these occasions they are acting as Sovereign of Canada and members of the [[Royal family of Canada|Canadian Royal Family]].
:''Further information: [[Royal family of Canada#Duties|Canadian Royal Family: Duties]]''

The [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|oath of allegiance]], sworn by new members of the [[Canadian Forces]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentarians]], is an oath to the Monarch as Sovereign of Canada, and to his/her heirs and successors according to law.  New [[citizenship|citizens]] also give fealty to the Monarch in the [[Oath of citizenship (Canada)|Oath of Citizenship]].

{{Main|Canadian royal symbols}}

Despite the removal or replacement of certain monarchical symbols as national symbols through the 1970s and 1980s, the Crown remains a visible part of the everyday lives of Canadians. What were formerly purely British symbols became symbols of the Monarch, or loyalty thereto.

The Monarchy is presently symbolized through images of the Sovereign on currency and in portraits in public buildings; in songs, toasts and salutes;<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 404]</ref><ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 449-450]</ref> on [[Canadian honours system|Canadian decorations and honours]]; on provincial and [[Coat of Arms of Canada|national Coats of Arms]].  Certain key days are also reserved to celebrate the monarchy, notably [[Victoria Day]], the holiday for celebrating the Sovereign's birthday,<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/jfa-ha/victoria_e.cfm Heritage Canada: Victoria Day]</ref> and the day of the [[Royal Christmas Message]], broadcast to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since 1932. 

There are also hundreds of places named for Canadian monarchs and members of the Royal Family all across Canada.  No individual has been more honoured than Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in the names of Canada's public buildings, streets, populated places and physical features.<ref>[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008358 ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'':Victoria]</ref>

====Royal presence====
{{Main|Royal visits to Canada}}
Members of the Royal Family have been present in Canada since the late [[1700s]], either on military manoeuvres, for official tours, or as governors; various members of the Royal Family have served as the vice-regal representative of the British, and later Canadian monarch. Though all of the Royal Family currently lives outside of the country, members are still regular visitors, enough so that on occasion [[royal visits to Canada]] are also referred to by monarchists as "Royal Homecomings." These events are often marked with a variety of ceremonies, the granting of honours and general celebrations, even though these events are not always official holidays.

The Queen regularly undertakes tours of Canada to celebrate Canadian culture, milestone anniversaries, military remembrances, and the like. Other Royals will perform the same tasks in the Queen's place, from time to time, usually on a less grand scale or for events of a lesser importance. These tours are at the invitation of, organized, and paid for by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]], provincial government, or a combination of both; hence, they are called "official tours" or "official visits."<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4384.asp#2.5 Buckingham Palace: Guidelines and Procedures for the Acceptance, Classification, Retention and Disposal of Gifts to Members of the Royal Family]</ref>

The first French and British colonizers of Canada interpreted the hereditary nature of some indigenous North American chieftainships as a form of monarchy, often referring to these leaders as kings and their lands as kingdoms.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html The Four Indian Kings]</ref> There is also evidence that the aboriginals had an understanding of monarchy, most notably in the legend of the [[Kingdom of Saguenay]], and tales of "wealthy kingdoms in the north" told by [[Iroquois|Iroquoians]] to [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534.<ref>[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History]</ref><ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003]</ref>

Canada has been the territory of a monarchy, or a monarchy in its own right, since the establishment of [[New France]]. Territory of the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]] was merged with the North American colonies under the [[British monarchy|British Crown]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. In 1867, Canada became a self-governing [[Dominion]] under the British Crown (originally intended to be named the [[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Kingdom of Canada]]), and, from that date to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, Canada developed into a kingdom in its own right. Thus, kings and queens reigning over Canada have included the [[List of French monarchs|monarchs of France]] (from [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1534 to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1763), [[List of British monarchs|those of the UK]] (from [[Anne of Great Britain]] in 1713 to [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1952), to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Canada today.

Canada's emergence as a sovereign constitutional monarchy, with a Crown separate to that of the United Kingdom, was demonstrated in the abdication of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] in 1936; when Canada had to pass its own ''Succession to the Throne Act'', that effected changes to the rules of succession in Canada so that they matched those within the other Realms of the British Empire.<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onsc/2003/2003onsc11019.html O'Donohue v. Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada]</ref> A few years later Canada's new status was again demonstrated when [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] travelled from Canada into the United States as [[Queen of Canada|King and Queen of Canada]].<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/05/0532/053201/053201130206_e.html The Royal Tour of 1939]</ref>  The ''[[Constitution Act of 1982]]'' entrenched the monarchy in Canada. Any change to the position of the monarch or the monarch's representatives in Canada now requires the consent of the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]], the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces.

Through the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of [[Quebec nationalism]] and changes in Canadian identity created an atmosphere where the purpose and role of the Canadian Monarchy [[Debate on the Canadian monarchy|came into question]]. Some references to the Monarch and the Monarchy were slowly removed from the public eye, and moves were made by the government to constitutionally alter the Monarchy's place and role in Canada. Eight of the ten premiers of the provinces were opposed to these proposals.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf#search='quebec%20monarchy' Dr. Stephen Phillips; Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark]</ref>

In 1999, it was revealed that the federal government was considering the idea of changing Canada to a republic. When this information was leaked to the media and public, there was some negative reaction, and even denial by the Prime Minister. A survey of the provincial premiers at the time showed only one in favour of such a move.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/loyalty.htm Premiers Nix Monarchy Abolition: "NOT A GOVERNMENT PROJECT AT THIS POINT"]</ref>

==Canadian Royal Family==
[[Image:Roy-fam-canada.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Canadian Royal Family gathers in [[Lac-Brome, Quebec]], 1976 (left to right: the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] (now [[Princess Royal]]), [[Mark Phillips]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] (now [[Earl of Wessex]]), the Queen, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] (now [[Duke of York]]) and the [[Prince of Wales]])]]

{{dablink|The Canadian Royal Family is a shared royal family.  This section describes the Royal Family from the perspective of [[Canada]]. In some other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, the concept, function and position of the royal family is similar, but the historical and cultural significance may differ. For information on the Royal Family in the other Realms, see [[#See also|Other Realms]].}}

The Canadian Royal Family is a group of people closely related to the Canadian Monarch; it is a non-resident royal family, as those who comprise the group live in the [[United Kingdom]]. Members of the family perform ceremonial and social duties but, aside from the monarch, have no role in the affairs of government. Those on the list carry the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] [[Majesty|His or Her Majesty]] (HM), [[Royal Highness|His or Her Royal Highness]] (HRH), or sometimes [[The Right Honourable]]; in French: ''Sa Majesté'' (SM), ''Son Altesse Royale'' (SAR), and ''Le très honorable''.

The concept of the Canadian Royal Family did not emerge until after the passage of the ''Statute of Westminster'' in 1931. Though the Act came into effect during the reign of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], Canadian officials only began to overtly consider putting the principles of Canada's new status as an independent [[Monarchy|kingdom]], with a Crown separate to that of the UK, into effect during the late 1930s.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Infoparl/english/issue.htm?param=130&art=820 Galbraith, William; ''Canadian Parliamentary Review'': Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit; Vol. 12, No. 3, 1989]</ref> At first, the monarch was the only member of the Royal Family to carry out duties solely on the advice of Canadian ministers; King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] became the first to do so when he dedicated the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial|Vimy Memorial]] in July, [[1936]] - one of his few duties performed during his short reign as [[Style of the Canadian Sovereign|King of Canada]].<ref>[http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/vimy/battle&CFID=14831976&CFTOKEN=67789669 Veterans Affairs Canada: VAC Canada Remembers: The Battle of Vimy Ridge - Fast Facts]</ref> Over the decades, however, the Monarch's children, grandchildren, cousins, and their respective [[Spouse|spouses]] began to perform functions at the direction of the Canadian government, representing the Monarch within Canada or abroad.

Despite the Royal Family having particularly served Canada since the 1930s, it was only in October, 2002, when the term "Canadian Royal Family" was used publicly and officially by a member of it: in a speech given to the [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut|Nunavut legislature]] at its opening, Queen Elizabeth II stated: "I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada's newest territory."<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4178.asp Text of The Queen's address to the Legislative Assembly in Nunavut, Canada, 4 October 2002]</ref>  The Canadian media often still refers to the Royal Family as the "British Royal Family."<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/artsentertainment/article/163172Howell, Peter; ''Toronto Star'': Queen rules for city critics; December 20, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/WinnipegSun/News/2005/04/11/991413-sun.html Canadian Press; Winnipeg Sun: Royal wedding details emerge; April 11, 2005]</ref>

===Composition===
Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Canadian Royal Family; those in the direct line of succession owe their allegiance to her specifically as the Queen of Canada,<ref name="Noonan">Noonan, Peter C.; ''The Crown and Constitutional Law in Canada''; Sripnoon Publications, Calgary; 1998</ref> and, according to the [[Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces|Department of National Defence]], members of the family who bear the title Royal Highness are subjects of the Canadian Monarch.<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: ''The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces''; pg 281]</ref> They are entitled to Canadian consular assistance and to the protection of the Queen's [[Canadian Forces|Armed Forces of Canada]] when they are outside of the [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, and in need of protection or aid.<ref name="Noonan" /> Their position as subjects but not citizens of Canada is reflected in the confusion that arises around the awarding of honours to members of the Royal Family; for example, the [[Order of Canada]] bestowed upon the Queen Mother was only honorary, though the [[Canadian Forces Decoration]] awarded to her was not.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/celebrations.htm Queen Mother appointed to Order of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&DocIDCd=2N0018 Commemoration Service for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,C.C.]</ref>

Because of the [[Commonwealth Realm#Nature of the Crown|shared nature of the Canadian Crown]], wherein it is recognized as legally separate from the [[The Crown#United Kingdom|UK Crown]], most members of the Canadian Royal Family are also members of the [[British Royal Family]], and are thus also members of the [[House of Windsor]]. There are some exceptions, however; for instance [[Angus Ogilvy]] was included in the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] Royal Family list,<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/_00_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: Royal Family]</ref> whereas he was not considered a member of the British Royal Family. It has been stated by the [http://www.crht.ca/ Canadian Royal Heritage Trust] that [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], due to his having lived in Canada between 1791 and 1800, and his being father of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], is "the ancestor of the modern Canadian Royal Family."<ref>[http://www.crht.ca/DiscoverMonarchyFiles/ArmedForces.html Toffoli, Gary; ''The Royal Family and the Armed Forces''; Canadian Royal Heritage Trust</ref>

Canadian poet [[George Elliott Clarke]] has publicly opined on a fully [[First Nations]] royal family, asking "why can't a truly Canadian royal family be Aboriginal or [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]? I think the project... would do wonders for national identity and national unity."<ref>[http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/senate/news.cfm?story=36105 Lingley, Scott; University of Alberta Senate: ''Clarke calls on grads to help achieve the ideals of Canada''; June 7, 2005]</ref> However, this would contravene the important convention laid out in the preamble to the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]'' (a part of the Canadian Constitution).

According to former [[Minister of Canadian Heritage and Status of Women|Minister of Canadian Heritage]] [[Sheila Copps]], the Canadian federal government refers to an official list of Royal Family members for matters of honours. Divorced spouses of the Monarch's descendants are removed from this list, as was the case with [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].<ref name="Copps">[http://www.torontosun.com/News/Columnists/Copps_Sheila/2006/04/26/1550711.html Copps, Sheila; ''Toronto Sun: PM should ignore flag bureaucrats'']; [[April 26]], [[2006]]</ref> As well, the official website of the Department of Canadian Heritage "Canadian Monarchy" section provides a [http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/_00_e.cfm list] of Royal Family members, but has not been updated in several years, to take into account the deaths of [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]] (2004) and [[Angus Ogilvy]] (2004); or the marriage of the Prince of Wales to Camilla Parker-Bowles (2005), nor does it include the grandchildren of the Queen.

The existence of a Canadian royal family has been contested by some, mostly in the small [[Debate on the monarchy in Canada|Canadian republican movement]]. However, [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]] [[Iona Campagnolo]] has also stated she feels Canada does not "really have a royal family."<ref>[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/lg.htm McCullough, John; ''Interview with Lieutenant Governor Iona Campagnolo''; April 23, 2004]</ref>

===Styles===
Unlike in the United Kingdom, in Canada the Sovereign is the only member of the Royal Family who has a title established through Canadian law. Though it would be possible for other members of the Royal Family to be granted distinctly Canadian titles (as is the case for the [[Duke of Rothesay]] in [[Scotland]]), they are only accorded the use of a [[courtesy title]], which is the title they have been granted via [[Letters Patent]] in the United Kingdom.
{{See|Style of the Canadian Sovereign}}

===Duties===
[[Image:POW-2.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] greeting Canadians after undertaking official duties in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], 2001.]]

Members of the Royal Family regularly carry out two types of obligations in relation to Canada: Official duties involve the Sovereign representing the [[State]] at home or abroad, or other members representing the Sovereign in Canada or elsewhere. For example, the Queen, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] have participated in Canadian ceremonies for the anniversary of D-Day in France, most recently in 2004.<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/timeline_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: Timeline: The Queen]</ref> Presently, the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] is responsible for organizing events wherein members of the Royal Family represent Canada.<ref>[http://www.canadapost.ca/personal/collecting/default-e.asp?stamp=stpartl&detail=1350 Canada Post; Canada's Stamp Details: ''Queen Elizabeth: 1926-2006''; Vol. XV No 1; January to March 2006]</ref> Unofficial duties are performed by Royal Family members on behalf of Canadian organizations, through their attendance at charity events, visiting with members of the [[Canadian Forces]] as [[Colonel-in-Chief]], or marking certain key anniversaries. The invitation and expenses associated with these undertakings are usually borne by the associated organization.

In 2002 members of the Royal Family were present at a total of 117 Canadian engagements, 57 events in 2003, 19 in 2004, and 76 in 2005.
{{See|Royal visits to Canada}}

Apart from Canada, the Queen and other members of the Royal Family regularly perform public duties in the other fifteen nations of the Commonwealth in which the Queen is Head of State (see, for example, [[List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II]]). As the Crown within these countries is a legally separate entity from the Canadian Crown, it is funded in these countries individually, through the ordinary legislative budgeting process.

===Popularity===
The popularity of the Royal Family with Canadians, as well as individual members of it, has fluctuated over the years. Mirroring the mood in the United Kingdom, the family's lowest approval was during the mid 1980s to 1990s when the children of the Monarch were enduring their [[Divorce|divorces]], and were the targets of negative tabloid reporting. Some recent poll results follow:

* An [[EKOS]] Poll conducted in May, 2002, concluded that 35% of Canadians found the Royal Family boring, 52% saw them as interesting, with 12% stating neither. 44% said they were irrelevant, 46% said the opposite, and 8% said neither. 59% saw the Royal Family as tired, 22% deemed them vibrant, and 17% put them at neither.<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf EKOS: ''Trust and the Monarchy: and examination of the shifting public attitudes towards government and institutions''; May 30, 2002]</ref>
* A March, 2005, [[Decima Research]] Poll found some interesting support levels for members of the Royal Family. 71% of Canadians had a favourable impression of the Royal Family. Only 20% had an unfavourable impression of the Royal Family. The poll found that 28% of Canadians saw the Queen as their favourite member of the Royal Family, Prince William was second with 26%, Prince Harry was third with 9%, Prince Charles was fourth with 6% and Prince Philip last with 2% support.

==Residences==
[[Image:Rideau Hall04.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Rideau Hall is the Monarch's principal Canadian residence, occupied by the Governor General.]]
The Sovereign's primary official residence is [[Rideau Hall]] in the city of [[Ottawa]]. Rideau Hall is the site of most state banquets, investitures, sewaring-in of ministers, and other ceremonies. Moreover, visiting heads of state usually reside at Rideau Hall. Another principal residence is [[La Citadelle]], in [[Quebec City]], and is used principally as retreat for the Governor General.  The provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] also maintain residences, used primarily by the respective Lieutenant-Governor, though the Monarch or other members of the Royal Family will reside there when in the province.

The aforementioned residences belong to the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers, and cannot be sold by the Monarch. However, monarchs have owned certain homes in a private capacity: King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] owned Bedingfield Ranch, near Pekisko, [[High River, Alberta|High River]], [[Alberta]].

==The Crown and the First Nations==
[[Image:HM-tablet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Her Majesty the Queen of Canada presents a tablet of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] granite with the ciphers of both herself and her great-great-[[Grandparent|grandmother]] Queen Victoria, at the [[First Nations University of Canada]], [[May 17]], [[2005]].]]
{{Main|The Canadian Crown and First Nations, Inuit and Métis}}

The Canadian Crown has a long relationship with the [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples of [[Canada]].  As with the [[Māori]] and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in [[New Zealand]], Canada's [[First Nations]] view their treaties as being agreements directly between them and the Crown, not with the ever-changing [[government of Canada]]. The ''[[Royal Proclamation of 1763]]'' remains an important document, mentioned in the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', outlining the Canadian Crown's responsibility to protect First Nations' territories.<ref>[http://www.ualberta.ca/~nativest/pim/waitangi.htm A Historical Analysis of Early Nation to Nation Relations in Canada and New Zealand:The Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Treaty of Niagara and The Treaty of Waitangi]</ref><ref>[http://www.treaty6.ca/princ.html Fundamental Treaty Principals]</ref>

Over the centuries there have been literal and symbolic gestures to demonstrate the "nation-to-nation" relationship, from the commemoration by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] of the "[[Four Mohawk Kings]]" in 1710,<ref>[http://www.tyendinaga.net/history/ Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]</ref> to Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] donating a piece of [[Balmoral]] granite engraved with the ciphers of [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and herself to the [[First Nations University of Canada]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050511%2FNATIVES11%2FTPNational%2FCanada&ord=1169237438207&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true Monchuk, Judy; ''The Globe and Mail'': Natives decry 'token' presence for Queen's visit; May 11, 2005]</ref>

==The Crown and the Canadian Forces==
[[Image:Wessex-dop2b.jpg|thumb|left|225px|HRH [[Sophie, The Countess of Wessex]], speaks with soldiers of [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]] as their [[Colonel-in-Chief]], June, 2005]]
{{Main|The Canadian Crown and the Canadian Forces}}
The Crown holds a prominent place within the [[Canadian Forces]]. The Queen is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the entire Forces, though the Governor General holds this title and exercises the duties on behalf of the Sovereign.<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/cc/hist_e.asp Governor General of Canada: Commander in Chief of the Canadian Forces]</ref> The Queen is also the Honorary Commissioner of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].<ref>[http://www.regiments.org/biography/royals/1926eliz.htm Land Forces: H.M. Elizabeth II Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]</ref>

The Sovereign's position and role in the military is reflected by Canadian [[navy|naval vessels]] bearing the prefix [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship]] (HMCS) (subsequently His Majesty's Canadian Ship during the reign of a king), and all members of the armed forces must swear allegiance to the Queen and her heirs and successors.  Members of the Royal Family are also [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of many Canadian regiments.
:''Further information: [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage#Military|List of Canadian Organizations with royal patronage — Military]]''

Members of the Canadian Royal Family have presided over many military ceremonies both abroad and at home, including [[Trooping the Colour]]s, inspections of the troops, and anniversaries of key battles; whenever the Sovereign or a member of her family is in Ottawa, they lay a wreath at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]].



==Organizations with royal association==
===Organizations under Royal Charter===
{{Main|Royal Charter}}
A [[Royal Charter]] is granted by the [[Monarch]] on the advice of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] which creates or gives special status to an incorporated body. This is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative, and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organizations under Royal Charters. Such organizations include charities, businesses, colleges, universities, and cities.  Today, it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters.

Examples of organizations under Royal Charter are [[Hudson's Bay Company]], founded by Royal Charter issued by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1670;<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/royal-quiz-answers.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Test your royal skills]</ref> [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], receiving its charter in 1786 from [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]];<ref>[http://www.canadascities.ca/caoreport_062000_1.htm#3 ''Canada's Cities: Unleash our Potential'']</ref> and [[McGill University]], which received a Royal Charter from [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in 1821.
[[Image:UCC-duke.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Queen's consort [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] speaks with UCC First Football team members at the [[Upper Canada College]]'s 150th anniversary celebrations, 1979]]

===Canadian Organizations with Royal Patronage===
Until [[Industrial Revolution|modern industrial]] times, all development of the [[Science]]s and the [[Art]]s were under the direct control of the [[Monarch]], exercised by the foundation of [[college]]s that today form the basis of modern [[Universities]]. The endowments to provide for these colleges were provided by [[the Crown]] to further education in both ecclesiastical and [[secularism|secular]] matters.

As time progressed, the educated members of these organizations formed into groups to lecture, demonstrate and [[debate]] their various subjects. These groups either sought Royal Patronage or were created as [[memorial]]s for the predecessors of the reigning monarch. Other colleges and foundations have been endowed by the owners of the great [[Estate (law)|landed estates]] and, in later times, by industrialists and finally modern [[corporation|corporate bodies]].  However, even in present times, relatively new organizations still seek Royal Patronage, though it is a ceremonial function wherein the royal will either volunteer their time for service or make a charitable donation.  To receive Royal Patronage, an organisation must prove to be long lasting.
{{see|List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage}}

==Awards and charities==
A number of awards in Canada are issued in the name of previous or present members of the Royal Family. These include:

* The [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] ''[[Prince of Wales Trophy]]'', donated by and named for [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]]
* The ''[[Queen's Fellowship]]'', named for the sovereign and awarded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada to an outstanding Doctoral Fellow entering a programme in Canadian Studies.
* The ''[[Queen's Plate]]'', named for [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]
* The ''[[Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal]]'', in commemoration of the Queen's fifty years on the throne
* The ''[[Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal]]'', in commemoration of the Queen's twenty-five years on the throne
* The ''[[Prince of Wales Stakes]]'', named for Edward, Prince of Wales
* The ''[[Commemorative Medal for the Golden Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]]''
* The ''[[Queen Elizabeth II Cup]]'' for horse show jumping
* The ''[[Prince Andrew Cup]]'' for cross-country running
* The ''[[Duke and Duchess of York's Prize in Photography]]''
* The ''[[Queen Elizabeth II Scholarship]]'' offered at Saint John’s-Ravenscourt School in Winnipeg
* The ''[[Prince of Wales Prize for Built Heritage]]'', for the conservation and preservation of buildings of historic importance
* The ''[[Connaught Cup]]'', for pistol marksmanship in the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]
* The ''[[Queen Elizabeth II Scholarship]]'' for Ontario high school graduates
* The ''[http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/services/awards.html#prince Prince of Wales Prize]'', awarded by [[Heritage Canada]] to a municipality that has shown exemplary commitment to heritage preservation

Charities and volunteer organizations have also been founded as gifts to, or in honour of some of Canada's monarchs, or members of the Royal Family.  These include:
* The [[Victorian Order of Nurses]] was a gift to Queen Victoria for her [[Diamond Jubilee#Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria|Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897
* The Canadian Cancer Fund was set up in honour of King George V's [[Silver Jubilee#Silver Jubilees in the United Kingdom|Silver Jubilee]] in 1935
* The Queen Elizabeth II Fund to Aid in Research on the Diseases of Children
* The Queen Elizabeth II Trust Fund to assist young Canadians in better understanding each other's language and culture was established during Queen Elizabeth's Silber Jubilee in 1977{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

==Debate==
{{main|Debate on the monarchy in Canada}}

To date, there has been little national debate about ending the Monarchy in Canada, in contrast to some other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s where the issue has gained a relatively higher profile.  Many Canadians continue to be unaware that the Queen serves as their legal Head of State; a 2002 [[EKOS Research Associates|EKOS]] poll found that only five percent of Canadians could correctly identify Elizabeth II as Canada's Head of State (the majority believing it to be the Prime Minister).<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf Eskos poll]</ref>

Where debate does exist, it tends to be a largely academic one, and several books have been written that explore the subject from a [[political science]] perspective. Neither of Canada's two main political parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], are officially in favour of abolishing the Monarchy; though the latter makes support for constitutional monarchy a founding principle in its Policy Declaration.<ref>[http://www.conservative-own.ca/documents/policy031905.pdf#search='conservative%20party%20of%20canada%20objectives%20monarchy' Conservative Party of Canada Policy Declaration]</ref> The [[New Democratic Party]] has officially stated it is willing to "explore" the issue, but in practice the party is not actively pro-republic and largely supports the status quo. Unlike other Commonwealth Realms, Canada has never had a head of government who has been openly republican.  Some politicians, having pledged allegiance to the Queen, have occasionally publicly voiced their opinion on the matter, following former-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Manley (politician)|John Manley]]'s 2002 statement that he was in favour of abolishing the monarchy - later stating that it was his personal opinion.

The one province that has shown significant republican sentiment is [[French language|French]]-speaking [[Quebec]]. The [[Parti Québécois]] has at times expressed hostility to the institution of the monarchy. However, as it views [[Quebec sovereignty]] as a more pressing concern, it has recently tended to decline comment on the issue, arguing that it is a concern of the Canadian federal government. 

Canada has two special-interest groups representing both sides of the debate, who frequently argue the issue in the media: [[Monarchist League of Canada]] and the [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]].
