'''Claude Autant-Lara''' ([[August 5]], [[1901]] in [[Luzarches]], [[Val-d’Oise]] &ndash; [[February 5]], [[2000]] in [[Antibes]], [[Alpes-Maritimes]]), was a [[French people|French]] [[film director]] and later [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]].

He was educated in France and at [[London]]'s [[Mill Hill School]] during his mother's exile as a [[Pacifism|pacifist]]. As a director, he frequently created provocative movies, saying "if a film does not have venom, it is worthless". In the [[1960s]], he turned his back on the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] movement, and from then on he had no popular successes.

His memoir is titled "The rage in the heart" (1984).

On [[June 18]], [[1989]], he came to public notice again, controversially, when he was elected to the [[European Parliament]] as a member of the [[Front National (France)|National Front]] and the oldest member of the assembly. In his maiden speech, in July, he caused a scandal by expressing his "concerns about the American cultural threat", provoking a walkout by the majority of the deputies.

In an interview granted to the monthly magazine ''Globe'' in September [[1989]], he engaged in what Minister of Justice [[Pierre Arpaillange]] referred to as "racial insults, racial slandering and incitements to racial hatred". He also described Nazi gas chambers as a "string of lies". The resulting scandal led to his resignation as European deputy. Moreover, the members of the Academy of the Fine Arts, of which he was a vice-president for life, voted to prohibit him from taking his seat thenceforth.
