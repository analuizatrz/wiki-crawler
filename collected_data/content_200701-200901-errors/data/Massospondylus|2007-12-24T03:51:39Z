'''''Massospondylus''''' ({{pronEng|ˌmæsoʊˈspɒndɨləs}}, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], meaning "elongated vertebra") is a [[genus]] of [[prosauropoda|prosauropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the early [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] ([[Hettangian]] to [[Pliensbachian]] [[faunal stage|ages]], ca. 200&ndash;183 [[annum|million years ago]]). It was described by Sir [[Richard Owen]] in 1854 from remains found in [[South Africa]], and is thus one of the first dinosaurs to have been named. Fossils have since been found in [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]], and other parts of South Africa. Further material from [[Arizona]]'s [[Kayenta Formation]], [[India]], and [[Argentina]] has been assigned to this genus, but may not belong to ''Massospondylus''. 

The [[type species|type]], and only universally recognized species, is ''M. carinatus'', although six other species have been named during the past 150 years. Prosauropod [[systematics]] have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years, and many scientists disagree where exactly ''Massospondylus'' lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. The family name [[Massospondylidae]] was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of prosauropod relationships is in a state of flux, it is unclear which other dinosaurs&mdash;if any&mdash;belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.

Although ''Massospondylus'' was long depicted as [[quadruped]]al, a 2007 study found it to be [[bipedalism|bipedal]]. It was probably a plant eater ([[Herbivory|herbivore]]), although it is speculated that the prosauropods may have been [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]. This animal, 4&ndash;6&nbsp;[[metre|meters]] (13&ndash;20&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) long, had a long neck and tail, with a small head and slender body. On each of its forefeet, it bore a sharp thumb claw that was used in defense or feeding. Recent studies indicate ''Massospondylus'' grew steadily throughout its lifespan, possessed [[air sac]]s similar to those of birds, and may have cared for its young.
==Description==

''Massospondylus'' was a typical prosauropod in most other respects. It possessed a slender body and long neck, with around nine long cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] faced forward, as with most [[saurischia]]ns. It had a slighter build than that of ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', an otherwise-similar prosauropod dinosaur.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> A recent discovery shows that ''Massospondylus'' possessed well-developed [[clavicle]]s, joined in a [[furcula]]-like arrangement, suggesting both that it had immobile [[scapula|shoulder blades]] and that clavicles were not rudimentary and nonfunctional in those dinosaurs that did not have true furculae.  This discovery also indicates that the furcula of [[bird]]s is derived from clavicles.<ref name=YV05>{{cite journal |last=Yates |first=Adam M. |coauthors=and Vasconcelos, Cecilio C. |year=2005 |title=Furcula-like clavicles in the prosauropod dinosaur ''Massospondylus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=466–468}} {{doi|id=10.1671/0272-4634(2005)025%5B0466:FCITPD%5D2.0.CO;2 |label=10.1671/0272-4634(2005)025&#x5b;0466:FCITPD&#x5d;2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

Like ''Plateosaurus'', it had five digits on each foot, with a large thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The fourth and fifth digits of the forepaws were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look. The 2007 study indicated that ''Massospondylus'' held its [[manus (zoology)|manus]] (hands) in a semi-supinated ("prayer-like") orientation, with the palmar surfaces facing one another; the wrist was never found rotated in articulated (still-connected) fossil specimens.<ref name="Bon07"/> 
[[Image:Massospondylus Skull Steveoc 86.png|thumb|300px|Above is a diagram of the skull of ''Massospondylus'', showing the various skull openings.]]
The small head of ''Massospondylus'' was approximately half the length of the [[femur]]. Numerous openings, or ''[[fenestrae]]'', in the skull reduced its weight and provided space for muscle attachment and sensory organs. These fenestrae were present in pairs, one on each side of the skull. At the front of the skull were two large, elliptical [[nostril|nares]]. The [[orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] were proportionally larger in ''Massospondylus'' than in related genera such as ''Plateosaurus''.  The [[antorbital fenestra]]e, smaller than those seen in ''Plateosaurus'', were situated between the eyes and the nose. At the rear of the skull were two more pairs of [[temporal fenestra]]e: the [[infratemporal fenestra|lateral temporal fenestra]]e immediately behind the eye sockets and the supratemporal fenestrae on top of the skull. Small fenestrae also penetrated each [[mandible]].<ref name="Dinosauria"/> The shape of the skull is traditionally restored as wider and shorter than that of ''Plateosaurus'', but this appearance may be due just to differential crushing experienced by the various specimens.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> Some features of the skull are variable between individuals; for example, the thickness of the upper border of the orbit and the height of the posterior [[maxilla]].  These differences may be due to [[sexual dimorphism]]<ref name=GKR90>{{cite journal |last=Gow |first=Christoper E. |coauthors=J.W. Kitching and Michael K. Raath |year=1990 |title=Skulls of the prosauropod dinosaur ''Massospondylus carinatus'' Owen in the collections of the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research |journal=Palaeontologia Africana |volume=27 |pages=45–58}}</ref> or individual variation.<ref name=PMG97>{{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Galton |year=1997 |title=Comments on sexual dimorphism in the prosauropod dinosaur ''Plateosaurus engelhardti'' (Upper Triassic, Trossingen) |journal=Neus Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie, Monatshefte |volume=11 |pages=674–682}}</ref>

As with other prosauropods, it has been proposed that ''Massospondylus'' had cheeks.  This theory was proposed because there are a few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when ''Massospondylus'' ate.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of ''Massospondylus'' as possessing pronounced [[malocclusion|overbite]]s and suggested the presence of a [[keratin|horny]] beak on the tip of the lower jaw to make up the difference in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout.<ref name=CA86>{{cite book |last=Crompton |first=A.W. |coauthors=John Attridge |year=1986 |chapter=Masticatory apparatus of the larger herbivores during Late Triassic and Early Jurassic times |editor=Kevin Padian (ed.) |title=The Beginning of the Age of Dinosaurs: Faunal Change Across the Triassic–Jurassic Boundary |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=223–236 |isbn=0-521-36779-4 }}</ref> However, this was later shown to be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top-bottom plane. Skulls not crushed in this orientation do not show an overbite.<ref name=GKR90/> There also seems to be some variation of tooth morphology based on the position of teeth in the jaw, although this is not as pronounced as the specialization of teeth in ''[[Heterodontosaurus]]''. Teeth closer to the front of the snout had round cross-sections and tapered to points, unlike the back teeth, which were [[spatula]]te and had oval cross-sections.<ref name="Dinosauria"/>

===Dubious names===
Several dinosaurs are often considered synonymous with ''Massospondylus''. These include ''Aristosaurus'', ''Dromicosaurus'', ''Gryponyx'', ''Hortalotarsus'', ''Leptospondylus'', and ''Pachyspondylus'', which are dubious names of little scientific value.<ref name="Cooper"/> ''Hortalotarsus skirtopodus'' was named by [[Harry Seeley]] in 1894. The fossils consist of partial leg bones. The following year, Richard Owen named a few fossil vertebrae ''Leptospondylus capensis'' and ''Pachyspondylus orpenii''. These fragmentary fossils were later destroyed in World War II. ''Aristosaurus erectus'' was named by E.C.N. van Hoepen in 1920 based on a nearly complete skeleton. Hoepen also named ''Dromicosaurus gracilis'', which consisted of a partial skeleton. ''Gryponyx taylori'' was named by [[Sidney H. Haughton]] in 1924. It consists of hip bones. All of the above fossils come from the Hettangian or Sinemurian faunal stages of South Africa, where ''Massospondylus'' has been found.<ref name="Tweet">{{cite web| last =Tweet| first =Justin| title =Sauropodomorpha| work =Thescelosaurus!| year =2007| url =http://www.users.qwest.net/~jstweet1/sauropodomorpha.htm| accessdate =2007-12-16}}</ref><ref name=WETAL04>{{cite book |last=Weishampel |first=David B. |coauthors=Paul M.

It is not clear which carnivores may have preyed on ''Massospondylus''. Most of the theropods which have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age in southern Africa, such as ''Megapnosaurus'',  were smaller than mid-sized prosauropods like ''Massospondylus''.  These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to wear down prosauropods, which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws.<ref name=GSP88/> The 6-meter-(20&nbsp;ft-)long<ref name="Smithetal">{{cite book |last=Smith |first=N.D. |coauthors=P.J.

==Paleobiology==
As with all dinosaurs, much of the biology of ''Massospondylus'', including its behavior, coloration, and physiology, remains unknown. However, recent studies have allowed for informed speculation on subjects such as growth patterns,<ref name="Sanderklein"/> diet,<ref name="Weemsetal"/> posture,<ref name="Bon07"/> reproduction,<ref name="Reiszetal05"/> and respiration.<ref name="Wedel"/>

A 2007 study suggested that ''Massospondylus'' may have used its short arms in defense from predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that ''Massospondylus'' could have used its large [[thumb|pollex]] (thumb) claw in combat or to strip plant material from trees.<ref name ="Bon07"/> 

===Growth===
A 2005 study indicated that ''Massospondylus''' sister taxon, ''Plateosaurus'', exhibited growth patterns affected by environmental factors. The study indicated that when food was plentiful, or when the climate was favorable, ''Plateosaurus'' exhibited accelerated growth. This pattern of growth is called "developmental plasticity". It is unseen in other dinosaurs, including ''Massospondylus'', despite the close relationship between ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Massospondylus''. The study indicated that ''Massospondylus'' grew along a specific growth trajectory with little variation in the growth rate and ultimate size of an individual.<ref name="Sanderklein">{{cite journal| last =Sander| first =P. Martin| coauthors = Nicole Klein| title =Developmental plasticity in the life history of a prosauropod dinosaur| journal =Science| volume =310| issue =5755| pages =1800–1802| year =2005|  doi =10.1126/science.1120125| pmid =16357257}}</ref> Another study indicated that ''Massospondylus'' grew at a maximum rate of 34.6&nbsp;kg (76.3&nbsp;lb) per year and was still growing at around 15 years of age.<ref name="Ericksonetal">{{cite journal| last =Erickson| first =Gregory M.|  coauthors =Kristina Curry Rogers and Scott A. Yerby| title =Dinosaurian growth patterns and rapid avian growth rates| journal =Nature| volume =412| issue =| pages =429–433| year =2001| doi =10.1038/35086558}}</ref>

===Diet===
Prosauropods such as ''Massospondylus'' may have been [[Herbivory|herbivorous]] or [[omnivore|omnivorous]]. As recently as the 1980s, paleontologists debated the possibility of [[carnivore|carnivory]] in prosauropods.<ref name="Cooper"/><ref name="Attridgeetal85"/> However, the hypothesis of carnivorous prosauropods has been discredited, and all recent studies favor a herbivorous or omnivorous lifestyle for these animals. Galton and Upchurch (2004) found that cranial characteristics (such as jaw articulation) of most prosauropods are closer to those of herbivorous reptiles than those of carnivorous ones, and the shape of the tooth [[Crown (tooth)|crown]] is similar to those of modern herbivorous or omnivorous [[iguana]]s. The maximum width of the crown was greater than that of the root, resulting in a cutting edge similar to those of extant herbivorous or omnivorous reptiles.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> Barrett (2000) proposed that prosauropods supplemented their herbivorous diets with small prey or [[carrion]].<ref name="Barrett">{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=P.M. |chapter=Prosauropod dinosaurs and iguanas: Speculations on the diets of extinct reptiles |editor=Hans-Dieter Sues |year=2000 |title=Evolution of Herbivory in Terrestrial Vertebrates: Perspectives from the Fossil Record |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-59449-3 |pages=pp. 42–78}}</ref> [[Gastrolith]]s (gizzard stones) have been found in association with ''Massospondylus'' fossils,<ref name="Weemsetal">{{cite journal| last =Weems| first =Robert E.| coauthors = Michelle J.

===Reproduction===
[[Image:Massospondylus baby BW.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An artist's depiction of a juvenile ''Massospondylus'', shown here as a quadruped]]
In 1977, seven 190-million-year-old ''Massospondylus'' eggs were found in [[Golden Gate Highlands National Park]] in [[South Africa]] by [[James Kitching]], who identified them as most likely belonging to ''Massospondylus''. It was nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15-[[centimetre|centimeter]]-(6&nbsp;in-)long embryos. They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found. Notably, the near-hatchlings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Based on the lack of teeth and the animal's body proportions, scientists speculate that postnatal care might have been necessary. The four legs of the near-hatchlings were of equal length, indicating that newly hatched ''Massospondylus'' were quadrupedal. The skull and eyes were proportionately oversized, as in other very young vertebrates.  The quadrupedality of the hatchlings suggests that the quadrupedal posture of later [[sauropod]]s may have evolved from retention of juvenile characteristics in adult animals, an evolutionary phenomenon known as [[pedomorphosis]].<ref name="Reiszetal05">{{cite journal| last =Reisz| first =Robert R.| coauthors =Diane Scott, Hans-Dieter Sues, David C. Evans, Michael A. Raath| title =Embryos of an Early Jurassic prosauropod dinosaur and their evolutionary significance| journal =Science| volume =309| issue =5735| pages =761–764| year =2005| doi =10.1126/science.1114942}}</ref>

===Respiratory system===
Many [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs possessed vertebrae and ribs that contained hollowed-out cavities (pneumatic [[Foramina of skull|foramina]]), which reduced the weight of the bones and may have served as a basic 'flow-through ventilation' system similar to that of modern birds. In such a system, the neck vertebrae and ribs are hollowed out by the cervical air sac; the upper back vertebrae, by the [[lung]]; and the lower back and [[sacrum|sacral]] (hip) vertebrae, by the abdominal air sac. These organs constitute a complex and very efficient method of respiration.<ref name=oconnorclaessens2006>{{cite_journal |last=O'Connor |first=Patrick M. |coauthors= Leon P.A.M. Claessens|year=2006 |title=Basic avian pulmonary design and flow-through ventilation in non-avian theropod dinosaurs |journal=Nature |volume=436 |issue=7048 |pages=253–256 |doi=10.1038/nature03716}}</ref> Prosauropods are the only major group of saurischians without an extensive system of pneumatic foramina. Although possible pneumatic indentations have been found in ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Thecodontosaurus'', the indentations were very small. One study in 2007 concluded that prosauropods like ''Massospondylus'' likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs, based on the evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded that it was impossible to determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present.<ref name="Wedel">{{cite journal| last =Wedel| first =Mathew| title =What pneumaticity tells us about 'prosauropods', and vice versa| journal =Special Papers in Palaeontology| volume =77| issue =| pages =207–222| publisher =| location =| year =2007| url =http://sauroposeidon.net/Wedel_2007_pneumaticity-and-prosauropods.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =2007-10-31}}</ref>
