A '''planet''', as [[2006 definition of planet|defined]] by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), is a celestial body [[orbit]]ing a [[star]] or [[Stellar evolution#Stellar remnants|stellar remnant]] that is massive enough to be rounded by its own [[gravity]], not massive enough to cause [[thermonuclear fusion]], and has [[cleared the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbouring region]] of [[planetesimals]].<ref name=IAU>{{ cite web|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes|url=http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html|publisher=International Astronomical Union|year=2006|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref><ref name=WSGESP>{{cite web|year=2001|title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the International Astronomical Union| work=IAU|url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html|accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref>

The term ''planet'' is an ancient one having ties to history, science, myth, and religion. The planets were originally seen as a divine presence; as emissaries of the gods. Even today, many people continue to believe the [[astrology|movement of the planets affects their lives]], although such a causation is [[Astrology and astronomy#Historical divergence|rejected by the scientific community]]. As scientific knowledge advanced, the human perception of the planets changed over time, incorporating a number of disparate objects. Even now there is no uncontested definition of what a planet is. In 2006, the IAU officially adopted a resolution [[2006 definition of planet|defining planets]] within the [[Solar System]]. This definition has been both praised and criticized, and remains disputed by some scientists. 

The planets were initially thought to orbit the Earth in circular motions; after  the development of the telescope, the planets were determined to orbit the Sun, and their orbits were found to be elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes and shared such features as ice-caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the [[space age]], close observation by probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology. Since 1992, through the discovery of hundreds of [[extrasolar planets]], scientists are beginning to observe similar features throughout the [[Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]]. 

Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) and also at least three [[dwarf planets]] ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]). Many of these planets are orbited by one or more [[natural satellite|moons]], which can be larger than small planets. There have also been more than two hundred planets discovered [[extrasolar planet|orbiting other stars]].<ref name="Encyclopaedia">{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean |date=[[October 30]], [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-10-31}}</ref> Planets are generally divided into two main types: large, low-density [[gas giant]]s and smaller, rocky [[terrestrial planet|terrestrials]].

In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars. Ancient Greeks called these lights called "πλάνητες ἀστέρες" (''planetes asteres'': wandering stars) or simply "πλανήτοἱ" (''planētoi'': wanderers)<ref>H. G. Liddell and R.

The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one of their pantheon of gods, the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]: ''Helios'' and ''Selene'' were the names of both planets and gods; ''Phainon'' was sacred to [[Cronus|Kronos]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who fathered the Olympians; ''Phaethon'' was sacred to [[Zeus]], Kronos's son who deposed him as king; ''Pyroeis'' was given  to [[Ares]], son of Zeus and god of war; ''Phosphorus'' was ruled by [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love; and [[Hermes]] ruled over ''Stilbon''.<ref name=astronomy>{{cite book|title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy|author=James Evans|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|pages=296-7}}</ref> The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets was  almost certainly borrowed from the [[Babylonians]] (contemporary [[Mesopotamia]]n civilisation) from absorbed astronomical learning around 600 BCE, including the [[constellations]] and the [[zodiac]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Chronological History of Babylonian Astronomy|author=Gary D.

There does, however, appear to have been some confusion in translation.

However, Nergal, unlike Ares, was also a god of the dead and a god of pestilence.</ref> [[Sumer]]ians, who lived in the same region as Babylonians until the [[3rd millennium BC]] and are credited as one of the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]], appear to have known at least some of the planets.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.sumerian.org/sumerfaq.htm#s39|title=Sumerian Questions and Answers|publisher=www.sumerian.org|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref>.

Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian pantheon of gods]]. While modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and, later, the [[Catholic Church]], use the Roman (or Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-Europeans]], shared with them a [[Roman mythology|common pantheon]] under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given [[Greek mythology|their gods]]. During the later period of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greek Mythography in the Roman World|author=Alan Cameron|year=2005|publisher=OUP}}</ref> When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names.
To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets; each presumed to be [[Geocentric model|circling the Earth]] according to the complex laws laid out by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century BCE. They were, in increasing order from Earth (according to Ptolemy): the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.<ref>{{cite web | title=Astra Planeta | publisher=Theoi Project | first=Aaron | last=Atsma | year=2007 | url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html | accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained: Uranus ([[Ouranos]]) and Neptune ([[Poseidon]]).

[[Image:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|left|Early printed rendition of a geocentric cosmological model.]]

Some [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], following a belief imported from [[Mesopotamia]] into [[Hellenistic Egypt]],<ref>{{cite web | first=Bill | last=Arnett | year=2006 | title=Appendix 5: Planetary Linguistics | url=http://www.nineplanets.org/days.html | accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth. The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest to the closest planet). Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Jupiter and Venus. Since each day was named by the god that started it, this is also the order of the [[days of the week]] in the [[Roman calendar]] &mdash; and still preserved many modern languages.<ref name="weekdays">{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Falk | title=Astronomical Names for the Days of the Week | journal=Journal of the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]]

In English the other days were renamed after [[Tyr|Tiw]], (Tuesday) [[Woden|Wóden]] (Wednesday), [[Thor|Thunor]] (Thursday), and [[Frige|Fríge]] (Friday), [[Anglo-Saxon gods]] considered similar or equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus respectively.

Many of the [[Romance languages]] retain the old Roman word ''[[Terra (mythology)|terra]]'' (or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry land" (as opposed to "sea").<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=terrain|title=Etymology of "terrain"|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> However, the non-Romance languages  use their own respective native words.

The same is true for the Sun and the Moon, though they are no longer considered planets. Also, in [[ancient Greece]] as well as in [[Chinese astronomy|ancient China]],<ref>Colin Ronan, "Astronomy in China, Korea and Japan," in Walker, ed., ''Astronomy Before the Telescope'', pp. 264-5.</ref> it was believed that Earth was in the center of the [[Universe]] and that all the 7 "planets" circled around the Earth. The reason for this was because stars and planets appeared to revolve around the Earth each day,<ref>Thomas S. Kuhn, ''The Copernican Revolution'', pp. 5-20</ref>  and because there was a common sense perception that the Earth is solid and stable and that it is not moving but is at rest. 

Non-European cultures use other planetary naming systems. India uses a naming system based on the [[Navagraha]], which incorporates the seven traditional planets ([[Surya|Sun]], [[Chandra|Moon]], [[Budha|Mercury]], [[Shukra|Venus]], [[Mangala|Mars]], [[Brihaspati|Jupiter]],[[Shani|Saturn]]) and the ascending and descending [[lunar node]]s [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu]]. [[China]] and the countries of eastern Asia influenced by it (such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]) use a naming system based on the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five Chinese elements]]: Mercury 'water', Venus 'metal', Mars 'fire', Jupiter 'wood', Saturn 'earth'.<ref name="weekdays"/>

{{seealso|List of Solar System bodies formerly regarded as planets|Heliocentrism}}
[[Image:geoz wb en.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Heliocentrism (lower panel) in comparison to the geocentric model (upper panel)]]

The five [[naked-eye planet]]s have been known since ancient times, and have had a significant impact on mythology, religious cosmology, and ancient astronomy. As scientific knowledge progressed, however, understanding of the term "planet" changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the [[fixed star|star field]]); to a body that orbited the Earth (or that were believed to do so at the time); and in the 16th century to something that directly orbited the Sun when the [[heliocentric model]] of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] gained sway.

Thus the Earth became included in the list of planets,<ref name=galileo_project/> while the Sun and Moon were excluded. At first, when the first satellites of Saturn were discovered at the end of the 17th century, the terms "planet" and "satellite" were used interchangeably&mdash;although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Cassini | first=Signor

There may just be earlier publications within the ''[[Journal des sçavans]].''</ref> Until the mid-19th century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly since any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community.

In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century (such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]), were very different from the traditional one. They bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the [[Asteroid belt]]), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as "[[asteroid]]s". In the absence of any formal definition, a "planet" came to be understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun. Since there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.<ref>{{cite web | last =Hilton | first =James L. | date =[[September 17]], [[2001]] | url =http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html | title =When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets? | publisher =U.S. Naval Observatory | accessdate = 2007-04-08 }}</ref>

However, in the 20th century, [[Pluto]] was discovered. After initial observations led to the belief it was larger than Earth, the recently-created [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] accepted the object as a planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller, but, as it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, it kept its status for some seventy years.<ref>{{cite web

In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a flood of discoveries of similar objects in the same region of the Solar System (the [[Kuiper belt]]). Like Ceres and the asteroids before it, Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands. A growing number of astronomers argued for it to be declassified as a planet, since many similar objects approaching its size were found. The discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a more massive object widely publicised as the [[tenth planet]], brought things to a head. The IAU set about creating the [[definition of planet]], and eventually produced one in 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had [[clearing the neighbourhood|cleared their orbit]] (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus & Neptune), and a new class of [[dwarf planet]]s was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).<ref>{{cite paper

===Modern definition===<!-- maybe: Rigurous definition -->
{{main|Definition of planet}}
With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There was particular disagreement over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a [[Asteroid belt|belt]], or if it was large enough to generate energy by the [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[deuterium]].

In 2003, The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets made a position statement on the definition of a planet that incorporated a working definition:<ref name=WSGESP>{{cite web

#Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "[[brown dwarf]]s", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
#Free-floating objects in young [[star cluster]]s with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).

This definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries in [[journal]]s.<ref>See for example the list of references for: {{cite web

Nevertheless, it did not address the dispute over the lower mass limit and steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System.

This matter was finally addressed during the 2006 meeting of the IAU's General Assembly. After much debate and one failed proposal, the assembly voted to pass a resolution that [[2006 definition of planet|defined planets within the Solar System]] as:<ref name=IAU>{{cite web

Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight planets. Bodies which fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Pluto and Eris) are classified as [[dwarf planet]]s, providing they are not also [[natural satellite]]s of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion. After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.

This definition is based in modern theories of planetary formation, in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects. As described by astronomer [[Steven Soter]]:

{{quotation|''"The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of relatively large bodies (planets) in either non-intersecting or resonant orbits, which prevent collisions between them.

Beyond the scientific community, Pluto has held a strong cultural significance for many in the general public considering its planetary status during most of the 20th century&mdash;similarly to Ceres and its kin in the 1800s. The discovery of Eris was widely reported in the [[mass media|media]] as the "[[tenth planet]]" and therefore the reclassification of all three objects as dwarf planets has attracted a lot of media and public attention.<ref>{{cite news

===Dwarf planets===
{{main|Dwarf planet}}

Before the [[2006 redefinition of planet|August 2006 decision]], several objects were proposed by astronomers, including at one stage by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]], as planets. However in 2006 several of these objects were reclassified as dwarf planets, objects distinct from planets. Currently three dwarf planets in the Solar System are recognized by the IAU: Ceres, Pluto and Eris. Several other objects in both the [[Asteroid belt]] and the [[Kuiper belt]] are under consideration, with as many as 50 that could eventually qualify. There may be as many as 200 that could be discovered once the Kuiper belt has been fully explored. Dwarf planets share many of the same [characteristics as planets, although notable differences remain&mdash;namely that they are not [[clearing the neighbourhood|dominant in their orbits]]. Their attributes are:

By definition, all dwarf planets are members of larger [[populations]]. Ceres is the largest body in the [[asteroid belt]], while Pluto is a member of the Kuiper belt and Eris is a member of the [[scattered disc]]. Scientists such as [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] believe that there may soon be over forty [[trans-Neptunian objects]] that qualify as dwarf planets under the IAU's recent definition.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brad | last=Amburn

The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star  occurred on October 6, 1995, when [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[University of Geneva]] announced the detection of an exoplanet around [[51 Pegasi]].

It is far from clear if the newly discovered large planets would resemble the gas giants in the Solar System or if they are of an entirely different type as yet unknown, like ammonia giants or carbon planets. In particular, some of the newly-discovered planets, known as [[hot Jupiter]]s, orbit extremely close to their parent stars, in nearly circular orbits. They therefore receive much more [[solar radiation|stellar radiation]] than the gas giants in the Solar System, which makes it questionable whether they are the same type of planet at all. There is also a class of hot Jupiters that orbit so close to their star that their atmospheres are slowly blown away in a comet-like tail: the [[Chthonian planet]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

More detailed observation of extrasolar planets will require a new generation of instruments, including [[space telescope]]s. Currently the [[CoRoT]] spacecraft is searching for stellar luminosity variations due to [[Astronomical transit|transiting planets]]. Several projects have also been proposed to create an array of [[space telescope]]s to search for extrasolar planets with masses comparable to the Earth. These include the proposed NASA's [[Kepler Mission]], [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]], and [[Space Interferometry Mission]] programs, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]], and the CNES' [[PEGASE]].<ref>{{cite web

==Formation==
{{main|Planetary formation}}
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a [[nebula]] into a thin disk of gas and dust. A [[protostar]] forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating [[protoplanetary disk]]. Through [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]&mdash;a process of sticky collision&mdash;dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as [[planetesimal]]s form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form [[protoplanet]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

The energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals (as well as [[radioactive decay]]) will heat up the growing planet, causing it to at least partially melt. The interior of the planet begins to differentiate by mass, developing a denser core. Smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of this accretion, but the lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from the mantle and from the subsequent impact of [[comet]]s.<ref>{{cite web

==Attributes==<!-- This section is linked from [[Earth radius]] -->
Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad commonalities do exist between them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whilst others are also common to extrasolar planets.

All planets revolve around stars. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit in sync with the Sun's rotation. It is not yet known whether all extrasolar planets follow this pattern. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its [[sidereal period]] or ''[[year]]''.<ref name="young">{{cite book  | first=Charles Augustus | last=Young | year=1902 | title=Manual of Astronomy: A Text Book | publisher=Ginn & company
 | pages=pp. 324-7 }}</ref> A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, as it is less affected by the star's [[gravity]]. Because no planet's orbit is perfectly circular, the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its [[periastron]] ([[perihelion]] in the Solar System), while its farthest separation from the star is called its [[apastron]] ([[aphelion]]). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as the pull of its star's gravity strengthens; as it reaches apastron, its speed decreases.<ref>{{cite book

Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of [[orbital elements|elements]]:

*The ''[[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]'' of an orbit describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, while planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in our Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits.<ref name="young"/> Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eccentricity evolution of giant planet orbits due to circumstellar disk torques|author=Althea V.

[[Image:Semimajoraxis.png|thumb|200 px|Illustration of the semi-major axis]]
*The ''[[semi-major axis]]'' is the distance from a planet to the half-way point along the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit (see image). This distance is not the same as its apasteron, as no planet's orbit has its star at its exact centre.<ref name="young"/>
*The ''[[inclination]]'' of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In our Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the [[ecliptic]]. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the ''sky plane'' or ''plane  of the sky'', is the plane of the observer's line of sight from Earth.<ref>[http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~tatum/celmechs.html ''Celestial Mechanics''], Chapter `17, J.

The [[argument of periapsis]] (or perihelion in our Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.<ref name="young"/>

====Axial tilt====
Planets also have varying degrees of [[axial tilt]]; they lie at an angle to the [[reference plane|plane]] of their [[inclination|stars' equators]]. This causes the amount of light received by each [[hemisphere]] to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore possesses [[season]]s; changes to the climate over the course of its year. The point at which each hemisphere is farthest or nearest from its star is known as its [[solstice]]. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices.<ref name=Weather>{{cite web

====Rotation====
The planets also rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's [[rotation period]] is known as its [[day]]. All planets in the Solar System rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, except for Venus, which [[Retrograde and direct motion|rotates clockwise]]<ref>{{citation |title=Rotation of Venus: Period Estimated from Radar Measurements|author=R.

T.|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> though because of its extreme axial tilt, it can be said to be rotating either clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on whether one states it to be inclined 82° from the ecliptic in one direction, or 98° in the opposite direction).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Outer Worlds; Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Beyond|pages=195-206|year=2006|author=Michael P.

====Orbital clearance====
The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has [[Cleared the neighborhood|cleared its neighborhood]]. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s official [[2006 definition of planet|definition of a planet]] in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as [[Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] from full-fledged planethood, making them instead [[dwarf planet]]s.<ref name=IAU /> Although to date this criterion only applies to our Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Total Number of Giant Planets in Debris Disks with Central Clearings|author=Peter Faber & Alice C. Quillen|work=Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester|year=2007|url=http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0706/0706.1684v1.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>

===Physical characteristics===

====Mass====
A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the [[electromagnetic]] forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape,  but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dwarf Planets|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/|author=Mike Brown|work=CalTech|year=2006|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>

Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from [[star]]s. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass, beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for [[nuclear fusion]]. No objects of such mass exist in our Solar System; however a number of extrasolar planets lie at that threshold. The [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia]] lists several planets that are close to this limit : [[HD 38529 c]], [[AB Pic b]], [[HD 162020 b]], and [[HD 13189 b]]. A number of objects of higher mass are also listed, but since they lie above the fusion threshold, they would be better described as [[brown dwarfs]].<ref name=threshold>{{cite web| url=? |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog|work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia|year=2007|accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> 

The smallest known planet, excluding dwarf planets and satellites, is [[PSR B1257+12]] a, one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a [[pulsar]]. Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.<ref name=threshold />

====Internal differentiation====
[[Image:Jupiter interior.png|right|150px|thumb|Illustration the interior of Jupiter, with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen.]]
Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] interior consisting of a dense [[planetary core]] surrounded by a [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] which either is or was a [[fluid]]. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard [[Crust (geology)|crusts]],<ref name=terrestrial>{{cite web|title=Planetary Interiors|work=Department of Physics, University of Oregon|url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec16.html|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>  but in the gas giants the mantle simply dissolves into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets possess cores of magnetic elements such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and mantles of [[silicates]]. [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are believed to possess cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of [[metallic hydrogen]].<ref>{{cite book

====Atmosphere====
[[Image:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Earth's atmosphere]]
All of the planets have [[atmosphere]]s as their large masses mean gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface. The larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] close by, while the smaller planets ose these gases into [[space]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheppard|first=Scott S.|coauthors=Jewitt, David; Kleyna, Jan|title=An Ultradeep Survey for Irregular Satellites of Uranus: Limits to Completeness|journal=The Astronomical Journal| volume=129|pages=518-525| url=http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0410/0410059v1.pdf|format=PDF|year=2006| doi=10.1086/426329}}</ref> The composition of the Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced massive amounts of free [[oxygen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Earth's Atmosphere: Composition and Structure|author=Anne E.

====Magnetosphere====
One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic [[magnetic moment]]s which in turn give rise to [[magnetosphere]]s. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of [[electrical conductivity|electrically conducting]] material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity around itself called [[magnetosphere]], which the solar wind can not penetrate. The size of the magnetosphere can be much larger than that of the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the [[ionosphere]] with the solar wind, which can not effectively protect the planet.<ref name=Kivelson2007/>

Of the eight planets in our Solar system, only Venus and Mars lack such a magnetic field.<ref name=Kivelson2007/> In addition, the moon of Jupiter [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] also has one. Of the magnetized planets Mercury has the weakest magnetic field, and is barely enough to deflect the [[solar wind]]. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System. The magnetic fields of other giant planets are roughly similar in strength of that of Earth but their magnetic moments are significantly larger than the Earth's magnetic moment. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational [[Axis of rotation|axis]] and displaced from the centre of the planet.<ref name=Kivelson2007>{{Harvard reference|Surname1=Kivelson|Given1=Margaret Galland|Surname2=Bagenal|Given2= Fran|Chapter=Planetary Magnetospheres|Title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System 2e|Year=2007|Publisher=Academic Press|Editor= Lucyann Mcfadden, Paul Weissman, Torrence Johnson|ISBN=9780120885893}}</ref> 

In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star [[HD 179949]], which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star. The team hypothesised that the planet's magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star's surface increasing its already high 14,000 degree surface temperature by an additional 750 degrees.<ref>{{cite web | title=Magnetic planet|author=Amanda Gefter|work=Astronomy|year=2004|url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&id=2090
|accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref>

===Secondary characteristics===
[[Image:Voyager ring spokes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The rings of Saturn]]
Planets in our Solar System possess orbital resonances in their own right. All except Mercury and Venus have [[natural satellite]]s, often called "moons."  Earth has one, and Mars has two, and the [[gas giant]]s have numerous moons in complex planetary systems. Many gas giant moons have similar features to the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some have been studied for signs of life (especially [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]).<ref name=Grasset2000>{{cite journal | author = Grasset, O., Sotin C., Deschamps F., | title = On the internal structure and dynamic of Titan|year = 2000 | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 48| pages = 617–636|doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00039-8}}</ref><ref name=Fortes2000>{{cite journal | journal = Icarus | volume= 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 444–452 | year=  2000 | doi = 10.1006/icar.2000.6400 | title =  Exobiological implications of a possible ammonia-water ocean inside Titan | author = Fortes, A.D.}}</ref><ref>Jones, N.; [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1647 ''Bacterial explanation for Europa's rosy glow''], NewScientist.com ([[11 December]] [[2001]])</ref> 

The four gas giants are also orbited by [[planetary rings]] of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny '[[moonlet]]s' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites which fell below their parent planet's [[Roche limit]] and were torn apart by [[tidal forces]].<ref>{{cite journal

No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets. However the [[sub-brown dwarf]] [[Cha 110913-773444]], which has been described as a [[rogue planet]], is believed to be orbited by a tiny [[protoplanetary disc]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A planet with planets?
