{{Ayyavazhi}}
'''Ayya Vaikundar''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: [[:ta:அய்யா வைகுண்டர்|அய்யா வைகுண்டர்]]), according to [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]], a scripture of the [[Ayyavazhi]], was a [[Manu]] (father, sovereign) [[avatar]] of [[Narayana]]. As per the [[Ayyavazhi mythology]] the body in which '''Ayya Vaikundar''' incarnated is that of Mudisoodum Perumal.<ref> ''Akilathirattu Ammanai, Akilam nine, verse 431-438 Narayana ordering two celestial saints to bring the body of Mudisoodum Perumal for the incarnation of Vaikundar'' </ref> 

He is referred to as '''Sampooranathevan''', a [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]] (a deity), in the religious book [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilam]].<ref> '''N.Vivekananthan's''' ''Akilathirattu Ammanai, Moolamum Uraiyum'' Pakam Ontu, Chapter 8, page-414, line 17-20 ''Birth of Sampooranathevan'' </ref> However the exact date of birth of Mudisoodum Perumal was unknown. The Akilattirattu Ammanai mention that when the body of Mudisoodum Perumal is taken into the sea he was 24 years old. In that sense it was predicted as 1809 and in history there are different views about the year of birth. But some historians opinions it as 1810<ref> '''V.T.Chellam's''', ''Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum'' Chapter 12, Page 493, (foot note) ''"The reserchers's views and my earlier views as 1803 should be corrected as 1810."'' </ref> while others follow the view of Akilam.<ref> '''R.Ponnu's''' ''Vaikuntacuvamikal Valvum Valikattalum'', 1983, page-38</ref><ref> '''M.S.S.Pandiyan's''', ''Meanings of Colonialism and Nationalism: An essay on Vaikunda Swamy Cult'' , Studies in History, Vol. VIII 1992 page 177 </ref><ref> '''A.Sreedhara Menon's''' ''A Survey of Kerala History'', Madras 1996 (Revised Edition), Page 400 </ref><ref> '''Arunan's''' ''Tamilakatil Camuka Cirtirutam Irunuttantu Varalaru'', Madurai: Vaihai Publications, 1999, page-28 </ref> Any way the exact day and month of birth was unknown. 

==Birth of body and spirit==
{{main|Sampooranathevan}}
In 1809 a child born to the couple '''Ponnu Nadar''' and '''Veiyelal''' in [[south India]], at [[Swamithoppe]] in the [[Kanyakumari]] District. They are of [[Channar]] cast, which was considered as a lower caste in the then society. They are of very poor means, and initially named the child '''Mudisoodum Perumal''', meaning "Lord [[Vishnu]] with a crown", but due to objections from those of higher [[caste]], the family changed his name to [[Muthukutty]].<ref> '''P.Sarveswaran's''', ''Sri Vaikunda Swamikal-A Forgotten Social Reformer of Kerala'', Page-3 </ref>

The religious book, [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilam]], states a legend that the child was born dead, and then the soul of the [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]  [[Sampooranathevan]] was installed in the body. According to the legend, the parents found the child still for a time immediately after the birth, and then the child began behave normally. Thereafter, that boy grew up called '''Muthukutty''' in human history, and '''Sampooranathevan''' in [[Ayyavazhi mythology]]. 

Muthukutty, a religious minded boy, had special interest in the worship of [[Vishnu]]. The holy book [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilam]] mentions that he had set a pedestal for Lord [[Vishnu]] in his house and worshipped the deity devoutly.<ref> Akilattirattu Ammanai Published by T. Palramachandran Nadar, Star Press:Suchindram, 9th impression, 1989, page 197 </ref> At the age of seventeen, Muthukutty married [[Thirumalammal]] from the nearby village of [[Puviyur]], and led a family life with her. However, there is also an opinion that they were not married at all, but that, she had come to live with him only to serve him during his public activities.<ref> G.Patrick's ''Religion and Subalter Agency'', Chapter 4, Page 86 </ref> Thirumalammal had been previously married, but left her former husband to marry Muthukutty.<ref> N.Vivekananthan's, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum Pakam Ontu'', Chapter 8, Page 398, Line 22: ''Birth of Parathevathai'' </ref> According to quotes found in ''Akilam'', they had a male child and that the child was born to her in the relationship with her first husband. Muthukutty earned his living as a [[Palmyra]] climber and as an agricultural laborer.<ref> G,Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page78 </ref>

== The transformation ==
In his twenty-fourth year, Muthukutty was struck by a severe illness and suffered for a year. His mother took her sick son to the temple at [[Thiruchendur]], during a festival in [[Thiruchendur]]. There, Muthukutty went in to the sea and disappeared. The parents searched for his body for a whole day. According to legends, on the third day, [[Vishnu]] appeared on the sea-shore. On seeing him, Muthukutty's mother mistook him to be her son and tried to embrace him. But the god told her that he was no longer her son, but the son of [[Narayana]].<ref> M.S.S.Pandiyan, ''Meanings of Colonialism and Nationalism'', Page-177: ''"Vishnu had given him a rebirth as his son."'' </ref>   Then he started walking towards [[Detchanam]]. This place became a holy place for the devotees of [[Ayyavazhi Mythology|Ayyavazhi]] and they erected a temple there named [[Avatharappathi]] at Thiruchendur. This process is celebrated during the festival of [[Ayya vaikundar avataram]].

== The incarnation of Ayya Vaikundar ==
Ayya Vaikundar, who arose from the sea at [[Thiruchendur]] on 20th of the Tamil Month of Masi, ''(March 4<sup>th</sup>, 1833 A.D; '''3/4/1833''')'' is considered a unique [[Avatar]] by the followers of Ayyavazhi. [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilam]], speaks about it in great detail, as summarized below: 
<blockquote>
In each of the five [[yuga]]s prior to the transformation of Ayya Vaikundar, as each fragment of [[Kroni]] (evil or Devil) came into physical form, the Lord [[Vishnu]] incarnated as well, destroying them. However, in this the sixth yuga, the evil was called [[Kalineesan|Kali]], (n''ot the Hindu deity'')<ref> G.Patrick's, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Appendix, ''A Sequential Narration of The Salient Episodes From the Mythography of Ayyavali'', Page-206 </ref> and having no physical form (see [[Pre-Incarnational Events]] for this account) he occupied the mind of people of earth as the Mayai (illusion), causing them to behave discourteously.  [[Kalineesan|Kaliyan]] claimed, it was impossible to destroy him in this [[yuga]] as in the previous ones as he held the [[Wiktionary:boon|boon]] from gods, it was impossible for [[Narayan]], or any others, to incarnate in the world to destroy him. 

Since [[God]] could not incarnate directly, He incarnated as Ayya Vaikundar in three stages. 
*The first stage of Avatar was the born dead child (birth of the Body).
*Next, immediately the soul of Sampooranathevan was installed into the body, along with the Spirit (not Soul) of [[Narayana]] kept in Parvatha Ucchi Malai (a mythical mountain believed to be in this region) after the completion of the [[Krishna]] Avatar. This was the second stage of the Avatar.   
*Then in the sea (during the 24th year), the soul of Sampooranathevan was granted [[moksha]] (liberation from the cycle of death and birth, synonymous with heaven), unified to the [[Paramatma|Ultimate Soul]]. Now, the Spirit of [[Narayana]] along with the [[Paramatma|Ultimate Soul]] ([[Paramatma]]) incarnated in the body of a human being (Muthukutty). ''(see:[[Ayyavazhi mythology#The Incarnation|The Incarnation]])'' This is the third stage of Avatar and from then he was called Ayya Vaikundar. Then Ayya Vaikundar was given [[Vinchai]] by Narayanar.''(see: [[Vinchai to Vaikundar]])''.</blockquote>

According to Ayyavazhi legends Ayya Vaikundar was not merely a human, not merely [[Narayana]], and not merely the [[Paramatma|Ultimate Soul]], but he was a human and he was the [[Paramatma|Ultimate Soul]] and he was [[Narayana]]. He was the one who had the responsibility to destroy the evil.

There is another vew that Vaikundar did not take a human body and showed only a bodily appearance<ref> ''Thechanathu Thuvarakapathi Akilathirattu Akakorvai'' published by ''Thechanathu Thuvarakapathi'', page 37 </ref> to mankind based upon some quotes in akilam.<ref> N.Vivekanandan's ''Akilattirattu Ammanai moolamum uraiyum'', Pakam 2 Chapter 11, page 112, lines 34,35. </ref>

== Tavam ==
{{main|Tavam of Vaikundar}}

Having reached Poovantanthoppe, (present-day [[Swamithope]]), he undertook to perform a penance. The penance consisted of three stages, each spanning two years. There is a tradition that describes his postures during the six-year tavam as follows: during the first two years, he stood inside a pit of six depth, during the next two years, squatted on the ground, and, during last two years, sat on a raised platform. His appearance was squalid, "long and entangled plait of hair" and frayed clothes. He spoke less and subsisted on frugal meals.<ref> G.Patrick's, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 4, Page 79:''He seems to have spoken less and subsisted on frugal meals.'' </ref>

== Incinerating evil spirits ==
[[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] speaks of this act of incinerating the evil spirits as an important event in the incarnation of Ayya Vaikundar. It took place when he was performing his great penance, which had been announced by him to be the means of destroying the [[kalimayai]] - the illusory evil force.<ref> G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page-80 </ref>  He, then, gathered the people around, and caused some of them, both male and female, to get possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam).<ref> G.Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 4, Page 80 </ref> The possessed ones came and danced in front of the crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and get burned up in flames. When he had finished his orders, those dancing under the duress of possession got exhausted and fell flat on the ground. Thus the evil spirits were incinerated.<ref> Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandar Nadar, Star Press: Suchindrum, 9th impression, 1989, page 254-260 </ref>

== Seizing the powers of witchcraft, sorcery, and other esoteric magical practices ==

Similarly, Vaikundar performed another action to 'seize the esoteric evil powers'. Akilam says that, he took away the powers of those who knew to perform witchcraft, sorcery, and other magical rituals. People living in the hills, called as Kanikkarar, were believed to be powerful shamans or witchdoctors, having powers to contain or to provoke the demons. Vaikundar, in a trance, made some of these Kanikkarar to testify in front of the people that they had surrendered their powers. People grew appreciative of Ayya's actions. They began addressing him as Vaikuntacami. This implied an attribution of divinity to Vaikundar.<ref> G.Ptrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page 80 </ref>   [[Vaikundar]] exhorted the people as follows:

<i>"There are no demons, no devils,
No ill effects of magical practices,
No disease, no pain, and no extortion of taxes,
And, therefore, live courageously."</i>

== Vaikundar as Pantaram ==
[[Image:Ayya's Holy Perambu and Surai koodu.jpg|thumb|right|The things used by [[Ayya]]; 'Surai Koodu', 'Pirambu' and 'Thandayam'.]]
The fame of Vaikundar had begun to spread in the countries of [[Travancore]] and [[Tirunelveli]], and he had been gradually recognised socially as a religious person with extraordinary powers.<ref> G.Patrick's, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 4, Page 81 </ref> In the religious parlance of the time, he was addressed as a [[Pantaram]], a religious person hailing from, and serving the ordinary folk. Akilattirattu addresses him as NarayanaPantaram.<ref> ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' Published by ''T.Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression'', 1989, Page 253. </ref> 

People came to him to listen to his teachings and instructions, to be cured by him of different diseases, to witness, worship and serve a religious person. Vaikundar encouraged the people to come together around a well to take a ritual bath, irrespective of caste differences. He encouraged them to dine together in his presence.<ref> ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' Published by T. Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 251. </ref>

He gave out a number of teachings and instructions, the central point of which was that he had come to abolish [[Kali Yukam]], and to usher in an age of [[Dharma Yukam]], during the time of which the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. 'Uplift of the lowly is dharmam’<ref> ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' Published by T. Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 212. </ref> was a constant refrain in his teachings.<ref> G.Patrick's, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 4, Page-81 </ref> People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of [[Kaliyan|Kali]] by transforming themselves to be 'people of Dharma Yukam' and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they learned to live with self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said,  ‘if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself’ .   He said when people grew out of [[kalimayai]], Dharma Yukam would unfold itself and in that age, he would rule over the people as [[Dharma Raja]], the king of Dharma Yukam.<ref>  G.Patrick's, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 4, Page-81 </ref>

== Ordeals ==
Against the background of the growing popularity of Vaikundar, and the convergence of people around him in multitudes, a complaint seems to have been lodged against him with the [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma|king of Travancore]]. The king arrested Vaikundar and tortured him.<ref> LMS Report of 1838, Page 71: ''"The Government however, interfered, and the excitement quickly died away."'' </ref><ref> There s an information from oral tradition that the king took action against Vaikundar at the behest of the British power to which the LMS missionaries had petitioned in this regard, because of the growth of such a religious phenomenon was a hindrance to their missionary enterprise. But there is nothing in Akilam to support this view. </ref> There is an opinion that Ayya was arrested on 11 November, 1839.<ref> Manibharathi, "Samithoppu Ayya Narayana Cuvami - 3" in Tina Tanti Kutumba Malar, in dt.08-01-1995, Page-4 </ref> But the date is not mentioned in Akilam. 

''See also: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Vaikundar.27s trial|Vaikundar's Trial]].''

== Post-imprisonment activities ==
After he returned from imprisonment, Vaikundar inspired a group of his devotees to undertake a religious exercise called [[Thuvayal Thavasu]].<ref> ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' published by T. Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 290-298 </ref><ref> The LMS Report of 1838, page-71 </ref> He also practiced several miracles. He married the [[Saptha Kanniyar]] as [[Narayana]]r ''(see:[[Ayyavazhi mythology#Marriage with the Seven Virgins|Marriage with the Seven Virgins]])'', the [[Seven deities]] in the form of [[Ekam]] ''(see:[[Ayyavazhi mythology#Marriage with the Deities|Marriage with the Deities]])'', He initiated a lot of festivities around him  ''(see:[[Ayyavazhi mythology#Festivals and celebrations|Festivals and Celebrations]])''." The deities were made to 'come upon' some of the female devotees who became their human media, and then a marriage ceremony was performed eith these human media.<ref> ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' published by T. Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 336-338 </ref> There were ceremonial processions held amidst singing, incantations and shouts of joy by the followers. Several rites and rituals were instituted during these occasions.<ref> G.Patrick's, Religion and Subalter agency, Chapter 4, Page 83 </ref>

== Attaining Vaikundam ==
Later Vaikundar was invited by his devotees to their homes and treated in a grand manner. By way of soliciting his blessings, his devotees carried him to different places. During these occasions, he laid foundations in various places for small shrine-like centres, called as [[Nizhal Thangal]]s. Vaikundar came to recognize five individuals as his closest disciples. Through one of his disciples, [[Hari Gopalan Citar]], he wrote the holy book, called [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilam]].<ref> ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' published by Vivekanantha Pathippakam, 2004, Page 4 </ref> 

On [[3 June]] [[1851]], (malayalam era 1026 Vaikasi,21) Vaikundar attained Vaikundam ''(see also:[[Ayyavazhi mythology#Ascending to Vaikundam.2C the abode of Thirumal|Attaining Vaikundam]])''.<ref> Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandran Nadar, 9th impression, 1989 page  </ref> But How ever Samuel Mateer mentions the year as 1848.<ref> Samuel Mateer's, The Land of Charity, page-222. </ref> But today most of the historians opinins it as it is mentioned in Akilam. As he attained Vaikundam his body was interned in a tomb and, around that, a pati (temple) was raised later on. His devotees continued to visit this site, and performed the rituals as they used to do when Vaikundar was bodily present. His life and works remain the foundation of the [[Ayyavazhi]]. The head temple of the [[Ayyavazhi]] religion is the [[Swamithoppepathi]] and is located in the Village of [[Swamithope]].

==Five Citars==
Ayya Vaikundar has five disciples (citars). According to [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] the [[Pandavas]] of previous [[Dwapara Yukam]] was made to take birth in this [[Kali Yukam]] as Citars of Vaikundar. They are:
*[[Dharma Citar]]
*[[Bhima Citar]]
*[[Arjunan Citar]]
*[[Nakulan Citar]]
*[[Sakatevan Citar]]
