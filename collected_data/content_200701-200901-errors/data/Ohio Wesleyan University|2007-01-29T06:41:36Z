==History==
{{main|History of Ohio Wesleyan University}}

===Founding===
[[Image:SulfurSpringAdjusted2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Sulphur Springs, renovated in 2005, was a major vacation spot for health seekers in the 1830s.]]

In 1841, Adam Poe and Charles Elliott—Delaware, Ohio residents and leaders of the William Street Church—decided to establish a university "of the highest order" in central Ohio.<ref>Williams, p. 15.</ref> To that end, they purchased the Mansion House Hotel, a former health resort, with funds raised from local residents.<ref name="elliott">{{cite web | url = http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-a09.pdf| title = The University: Policy on Voluntary Sexual Relationships between Faculty/Staff and Students - Traditions (PDF) | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2005-09-01}}</ref><ref name="order">{{cite web | url = http://news.owu.edu/2003/elliott2.html| title = Elliot Hall Dedication | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2003-05-15}}</ref> Poe and Elliot wrote a a charter emphasizing "the [[democracy|democratic]] spirit of teaching" and formed a [[Board of Trustees]] early in the following year.<ref>Hubbart, p. 14.</ref> Ohio Wesleyan University, named after Methodism founder [[John Wesley]], opened on [[November 13]], [[1844]] as a [[Methodism|Methodist]]-related but [[nonsectarian]] college for male students.<ref>White, p. 229.</ref><ref name="liberal">{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/~catalog/cat-a04.pdf| title = Ohio Wesleyan University Catalogue | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2004-09-01}}</ref><ref name="amongfirst">{{cite web | author= Labaree, David F. | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~dlabaree/U.S.%20Universities%20Sorted%20by%20Founding%20Date%20ver%202.doc| title = U.S. Colleges and Universities | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-10-19}}</ref> 

OWU's first president, [[Edward Thomson]], stated in his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]] on [[August 5]], [[1846]] that Wesleyan was "a product of the [[classical liberalism|liberality]] of the local people."<ref>Hubbart, p. 22.</ref> This liberal philosophy  contributed to the college's vocal opposition to [[slavery]] in the 1850s.<ref name="1850issues">{{cite web | url = http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253| title = Roots of Secession: Slavery and Politics in Antebellum Virginia | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | accessdate = 2005-10-15}}</ref><ref name="thompson">{{cite web | url = http://members.aol.com/revepete/HolinessCh3.html | title = The Methodist Movement Comes to America and Impacts Slavery | publisher = Reve' M.

===Campus expansion and fundraising===
[[Image:ElliottHallOWU.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Elliott Hall, the first college building on campus, was renovated in 2000 and is [[Ohio]]'s oldest [[collegiate]] [[Greek Revival]] building.<ref>[http://www.owu.edu/news/2000/corns.html Renovated MUB Debuts as R.W. Corns Building]. Ohio Wesleyan University, [[2000-08-03]].  Retrieved on [[2007-01-08]].</ref>]]

During the mid-[[19th century]], Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fund raising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.<ref>Hubbart, p. 45.</ref> The [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Female College]], established in 1853, merged with OWU in 1877.<ref>Taylor, p.53.</ref><ref name="merged">{{cite web | url = http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=787 | title = Ohio Wesleyan University | publisher = Ohio Historical Society|accessdate = 2006-10-19}}</ref> Enrollment tripled from 1876 to 1888 and [[music education]] greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.<ref>Hubbart, p. 68.</ref><ref>Hubbart, pp. 72-80.</ref>

By the end of the 19th century, Wesleyan had added a College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844), a School of Music (1877), a School of Fine Arts (1877), a School of Oratory (1894), and a Business School (1895).<ref>Kukula, R. & K. Trubner (1923). ''Minerva: Jahrbuch der Gelehrten Welt''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Company</ref> To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. The Monnett extensions, University Hall, Slocum Library, and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 87-88.</ref>
[[Image:OWUGrayChapel2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|University Hall is built in 1893 on the academic quad featuring [[Neoromanesque]] architecture.]]
Between 1891 and 1895, Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[geology]], [[speech]], [[history]], [[French language|French]], [[English studies|English]], and [[economics]].<ref>Hubbart, p. 90.</ref> This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe.<ref name="nsfphdrate">{{cite web | url = http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/pdf/tabb1.pdf | title = Top 50 U.S. baccalaureate institutions of Ph.D.s: 1920–24 and 1995–99 (PDF) | publisher = National Science Foundation | accessdate = 2006-12-24}}</ref> Two professional schools for [[law]] and [[medicine]] were formed in 1896.

In 1907, the United Societies of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, installed their first chapter on campus. Two [[Rhodes Scholars]] were selected from OWU during 1905 to 1910.<ref>Hubbart, p. 112.</ref> 

In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided to keep Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word "university" in the institution's name.<ref>Hubbart, p. 110.</ref> The [[Bachelor of Science]] degree was abolished, which left only the [[Bachelor of Arts]]. In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized.<ref>Hubbart, p. 142.</ref> 

During the [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Hoffman]] presidency, the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a [[preparatory school]], and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.<ref>Hubbart, p. 127.</ref> In the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and [[sororities]] were formed. OWU also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and [[Perkins Observatory]]; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.<ref>Hubbart, p. 141.</ref>

===Twentieth century: years of change===
[[The Great Depression]] caused reduced enrollment and [[alumni]] donations.<ref>Hubbart, pp.140-160.</ref> While the [[faculty]] size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems in the [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Soper]] and [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Burgstahler]] administrations, and threatened the college's survival.<ref>Tull, p.180.</ref> 

The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 160-164.</ref> Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from eastern states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist students werer a minority among the student body;<ref>Burtchaell, pp. 174-175;</ref> ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s <ref>Burtchaell, p.304-319.</ref> and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in OWU's current loose historical affiliation.<ref>Burtchaell, p.323.</ref> Burtchaell stated it was those years that “in its personnel, its resources, and its students”, Wesleyan lost its “symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church,” (according to an extensive study into this relationship over the period 1842-1992).<ref>Burtchaell, p. 326.</ref>

In 1946, OWU introduced a new "Centennial Curriculum", which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.<ref>Tull, p.182.</ref> Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954.<ref>Tull, p.182.</ref> In the 1960s, faculty staff and administrators fought over administrative structure and control.<ref>Tull, pp.182-183.</ref> They eventually settled on a new "statement of aims" that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.<ref>Tull, p.183</ref>

The presidency of Thomas Wenzlau span three decades between 1969-1984.<ref>Murchland, p.34</ref> The first challenge for Wenzlau was campus unrest: Wesleyan students took over the [[ROTC]] building, demanded its shut-down and eventually eliminated its presence in 1970.<ref>Murchland, p.74.</ref> Students demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees. The period saw a furthering of the democratic process in the governance of OWU.<ref>Murchland, p.35</ref> His presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing "[[party school]]" image, <ref>Murchland, p.38-39</ref> leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.<ref>Murchland, p.39</ref> In 1979-1982, the campus newspaper [[The Transcript]] severely criticized Wenzlau's  presidency blaming it for "severely affecting the reputation of the college".<ref>Murchland, p.41</ref>. The exchange between the president and [[The Transcript]] lead to a [[Washington Post]] report on the school that eventually lead to the end of Wenzlau's presidency.<ref name="OWUandWP"> Peterson, Bill. "Enrollments Lower, Costs Higher". ''The Washington Post'', 12/19/1982, First Section, A5.</ref>

The leadership of [[David Warren]] increased admission standards for students, engaged students in a "live-in" presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium, whose objective was to focus on the liberal arts.<ref>Murchland, p.44-45</ref> Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the [[ABC]] and [[NBC]] networks.<ref>Murchland, p.45</ref> 

More recently, OWU has achieved several academic and athletic awards.

Wesleyan continues to undertake construction projects. The new Hamilton Williams Campus Center opened in 1991. The Memorial Union Building was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic Resource Center, the Information Systems department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, Business and Entrepreneurship. The [[Conrades-Wetherell Science Center]] opened in 2004 to provide 52,000 square feet of additional space for the science departments. 

An athletic fundraising campaign began in 2005.<ref>[http://www.owu.edu/news/2002/scicent.html OWU Celebrates Progress of Science Center Renovation]. Ohio Wesleyan University.

In its early days, OWU's curriculum began with classical studies, for the course catalogue maintained that "the classical course in Greek and Latin and pure mathematics bring correctness in mental processes that an applied art, or a living and slightly inflected language, do not permit."<ref>Hubbart, p. 88.</ref> Scientific courses were added to Wesleyan's curriculum in 1849, and since then, [[science|scientific]] subjects have become a foundation to the liberal arts curriculum.<ref>Tull, p.48.</ref> OWU also has very strong [[humanities]] and [[social sciences|social science]] faculties,<ref name="Peabody"/> and a highly-respected [[music]] department.<ref name="selfdescr2">{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/studentsSay.asp?listing=1023105&category=5&LTID=1 | title = What Ohio Wesleyan Students Say About... | publisher = Princeton Review | accessdate = 2007-01-10}}</ref>

===Emphasis on internationalism===
[[Image:UniversityHallFlags.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Flags in University Hall of students' countries represented at Ohio Wesleyan University.]]
OWU has upheld academic [[internationalism]] since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools. In 1879, Wesleyan alumna Elizabeth Russell founded [[Kwassui College|Kwassui Women's College]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education unimportant.<ref>{{cite book | last = Windolf | first = Paul | coauthors = Francisco Ramirze | year = 1989 | title = Expansion and Structural Change: Higher Education in Germany, the United States, and Japan, 1870-1990 | publisher = Contemporary Sociology | location= | id =Vol. 27, No. 2}}</ref> Today, Kwasuii College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan.<ref name="kwassuijp">{{cite web | url = http://www.kwassui.ac.jp/ | title = Kwassui Institute | publisher = Kwassui Institute | accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref> In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to [[Africa]] and opened a school in [[Mutare]], [[Zimbabwe]], that eventually became the [[University of Africa|Africa University]].<ref name="africauniv">{{cite web | url = http://www.africau.edu/ | title = Africa University | publisher = Africa University | accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref>

The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually. Since 1983, Ohio Wesleyan has been listed in ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' among colleges that attract the highest percentage of international students.<ref name="departmentofeducation">{{cite web | url = http://www.edupass.org/finaid/undergraduate.phtml | title = Schools with Financial Aid for International Undergraduate Students | publisher = Mark Kantrowitz | accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref><ref name="departmentofeducation2">{{cite web | url = http://www.edupass.org/admissions/schoolsearch.phtml | title = Choosing a School | publisher = Mark Kantrowitz | accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref><ref name="iied">{{cite web | url = http://opendoors.iienetwork.org/?p=49938 | title = International Students: Leading Institutions by Institutional Type | publisher = Institute of International Education | accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref><ref name="mostinternationalstudents">{{cite web | url = http://www.pmc.edu/about/ranking/2005/international.html | title = Most International Students | publisher = U.S.News & World Report| accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref> The percentage of international students grew in the early and mid-[[1990]]s.<ref name="chronicleOWUIntl">Desruisseaux, Paul.

==Campus==
{{main|List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings}}
{{seealso|Richard Ross Museum of Art|Ohio Wesleyan University Library|The Strand Theatre}}
Wesleyan's campus is located near the downtown area of Delaware, Ohio and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north/south street through the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into east and west sectors — the west sector consists mostly of residential and administrative buildings, and the east consists mostly of academic buildings. Many facilities have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to science, art, and athletic programs on campus.

===Community relations===
{{seealso|Delaware, Ohio}}
[[Image:ArtsCastleOhio.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The Arts Castle in Delaware, Ohio.]]
OWU has strong community ties with the City of Delaware (a town 28 miles (45 km) north of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]).<ref name="towngown">{{cite web | last = Donnelly | first = Sara | url = http://www.portlandphoenix.com/archive/features/02/04/19/feat_bates.html | title = Can Bates and L/A excel together? | publisher = The Portland Phoenix |date= April 18 - 25, 2002 | accessdate = 2006-11-29}}</ref> Delaware has 26,000 residents and is the county seat of one of the ten fastest growing counties in the country.<ref name="DelawareOhioPop">{{cite web | url = http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/ohio/delaware | title = Delaware | publisher = City Town Info|accessdate = 2006-11-29}}</ref> Due to the city's proximity to Ohio's capital and easy access to [[Interstate 71|I-71]], the city's population has recently grown more ethnically and socio-economically diverse.<ref name="DelawareOhioEthnic">{{cite web | url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/39/39041.html | title = State & County QuickFacts | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate = 2006-11-29}}</ref> 

Students participate in Delaware's community through a variety of educational, social, and cultural programs. The student-led Columbus Initiative, founded in 1989, is an [[experiential learning]] partnership between OWU and Columbus public schools;<ref name="experientiallearning">{{cite web | url = http://magazine.owu.edu/2005_spring_pdfs/feat_linden.pdf | title = Learning at Linden (PDF) | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref> the program offices are located in the Hamilton Williams Campus Center.<ref name="colinithwcc">{{cite web | url = http://service.owu.edu/staff.html | title = Campus Offices | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref> More than 150 Wesleyan students from this program tutor and mentor underprivileged pupils from Columbus.<ref name="columbusinitiative">{{cite web | url = http://magazine.owu.edu/feat_linden.html | title = Learning at Linden | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref>

Campus organizations cooperate with local residents on issues of [[civic]] participation and [[activism]]. Progress OWU allows students from Wesleyan and local schools to express their voices on [[politics]], [[public policy]], and [[corporate]] and [[social issues]], both on campus and in the local community.<ref name="progressservice">{{cite web | url = http://service.owu.edu/organizations.html | title = Student Service Clubs, Organizations and Small Living Units | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref>

Cultural programs also take part in community relations. In the 1960s, Wesleyan donated the Arts Castle, then part of the Fine Arts department, to the City of Delaware. It is now home to the Delaware County Cultural Arts Center. The Arts Castle hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging from ballet to fine arts.<ref name="artscastle">{{cite web | url = http://www.artscastle.org/house.html | title = History of The Arts Castle | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University, The Arts Castle | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref> In 2004, the OWU received a donation to rehabilitate the historic [[The Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] in downtown Delaware.<ref name="strandpurchase">{{cite web | url = http://www.owu.edu/news/2002/strand.html | title = Gift Support Enables OWU to Purchase Strand Theatre | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref>

[[Image:RedBlackCap.jpg |thumb|200px|right|Freshmen were required to wear a red and black cap in public in the 1920s.]]

Many Ohio Wesleyan traditions originated in Wesleyan's early years. Monnett Weekend welcomes female alumni, parents, and friends of Wesleyan. In different years, the schedule included a "People's Parade" with clowns, banners and a marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, Choral Arts Society, an all campus carnival complete with dunking machine.<ref>Murchland, p.79.</ref><ref>Hubbart, p. 121.</ref> It started in 1896 as a girls' athletic fête held at the Monnett Athletic Club for celebrating Mothers Day. All events were held at the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett Campus]], while men were barred, and female students danced around the [[Maypole]]. Ohio Wesleyan men, in turn, developed their own tradition; they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities discreetly.<ref>Tull, p.102.</ref> 

In 1884, the Ohio Wesleyan held its first ''Mock Convention'', which has reoccured in every [[presidential election]] year since 1920.<ref name="mockconvention">{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/%7Emock2004/cygnus/rules.htm| title = Mock Convention

In the 1920s, dinks (beanies) were required to be worn by all freshmen. Dinks were red caps with black brims and a black W on the front.<ref>Tull, p.98-99.</ref> If the freshmen disobeyed and didn't wear them, they were tossed into the Sulphur Spring.

[[Image:IHouseOWU.jpg|thumb|left|The I-House, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.]]
Approximately 200 upper class students live in the Small Living Units (SLUs). SLUs are [[cooperative|co-ops]] united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses. The houses are intended to provide students with an opportunity to live cooperatively with other students by sharing in regularly scheduled house chores, participation in the decision making process, and in some, sharing of the cooking responsibilities. Each unit houses a group of 15 students organized to promote a common theme, which usually determines the co-op's name. As of the 2006-2007 academic year, the SLUs consist of The [[Peace]] and [[Justice]] House, The [[Internationalism (politics)|International]] House, The House of [[Black (people)|Black]] Culture, The Creative [[Arts]] House, The [[Women]]'s House, The Modern Foreign [[Languages]] House, The House of Thought, The [[Habitat for Humanity]] House and The [[Ecology|Tree]] House. The University owns the houses, and the co-ops must therefore follow the University's living policies. However, they elect their own officers and do not have [[resident assistant|Resident Advisers]] or faculty in residence like other on-campus residence halls. At the end of each academic year, every existing and potential co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion during the next academic year. The University Housing office places co-ops in houses every year on a competitive basis.<ref name="SLUprocess">{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/ourtown/95.php | title = SLUSH is Here: Apply to your Favorite SLU | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2007-01-05}}</ref>

The nickname ''The Battling Bishops'' dates to 1925. This is also the name of the Wesleyan's mascot, ''The Battling Bishop''.
