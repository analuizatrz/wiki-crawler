'''HMS ''E18''''' was an [[British E class submarine|E-class submarine]] of the [[Royal Navy]], launched in [[1915]] and lost in the [[Baltic Sea]] in May 1916 while operating out of [[Reval]].

==History==
=== 1915 ===
The ''E18'' entered service in the UK in 1915, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander R.C. Halahan. She was dispatched to the Baltic from Harwich on August 28th with her sister-ship [[HMS E19|HMS ''E19'']], first travelling to Newcastle to repair one of ''E19'''s main armatures. They left Newcastle for the Baltic on the 4th of September. The two submarines separated and passed through the [[Oresund]] between Denmark and Sweden on the night of the 7th-8th September. During the passage E19 at one stage found herslf only metres from E18's stern and decided not to enter together.  ''E18'' encountered two German destroyers. She dived into water only 23 feet deep and - for almost three hours - progressed by crashing into the seabed and rising back up to break the surface. After several hours resting in deep water she surfaced in the morning only to be fired on by the [[German cruiser Amazone|cruiser ''Amazone'']]; after escaping her she was set upon by another two destroyers one of which came close to ramming her. On the 12th she met up with ''E19'' & [[HMS E9|''E9'']] off Dagerort, arriving in Reval (now [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]) on the 13th.<ref>''Forgotten Flotilla'', Leslie Ashmore</ref>

She operated out of Reval through the autumn of 1915. On October 11th, she was in position to attack the pre-dreadnought [[SMS Braunschweig|SMS ''Braunschweig'']] whilst patrolling off [[Libau]] (now Liepāja, [[Latvia]]), but her bow torpedo tubes could not be opened and the opportunity passed.<ref name="Wilson">''Baltic assignment : British Submariners in Russia 1914-1919'', Michael Wilson. 1985</ref>

=== 1916 ===
After operations were halted for the winter, the ''E18'' resumed patrols in the spring of 1916. Her second last patrol was to the Gulf of Riga with ''E1'' to shell beaches from the 28th April, returning to Reval on the 2nd of May. <ref name="Wilson"/>

In late May, she sailed for her final patrol; ''E1'', ''E8'' and two Russian submarines left the same day. Records differ on her exact fate, but it is certain neither she or any of her crew ever returned.

The diary of Francis Goodhart, captain of ''E8'', states that she and ''E18'' left port together on [[May 25]]th; ''E8'''s patrol was uneventful, and she returned to Reval on the 31st. However, ''E18'' failed to return; by 5th June Goodhart noted that the crews were "''very worried''". On the 6th, he noted that he had "''Heard from Essen that their W.T. had vaguely indicated presence of a submarine off Redshoff''<ref>There does not appear to be a place called "Redshoff"; it may be a mishearing of ''Kurisches Haff'', a German term for the [[Curonian Lagoon]] south of Memel/Klaipėda</ref>'' on Tuesday''<ref>i.e. May 30th</ref>''. Very slender hope...''" By the next day, June 8th, he recorded that a meeting had noted she had sailed with only 15 days food; the situation was "''very hopeless now, I fear. No news whatsoever''".<ref name="Goodhart">''Diary of Francis Goodhart'', published in ''Imperial War Museum Review no. 9''</ref>

Michael Wilson, a historian, records that ''E8'' and ''E18'' sailed on the 25th and parted the next day. On the 26th, at 4:42 PM, ''E18'' torpedoed the German destroyer ''V100'', blowing off her bow. Had it not been for the calm seas, it is likely she would have sank from the damage; as it was, she was towed back to port with several of her crew killed, requiring major repairs. Two days later, on the 28th, ''E18'' was sighted by a German aircraft off [[Klaipėda|Memel]] (now Klaipėda, Lithuania), ''E18'' was last sighted on the 1-6-1916 sailing north by the German u-boat UB30 northwest of Steinort. Wilson further states that it is believed she was lost "most likely by striking a mine" on her return to Reval west of Osel.<ref name="Wilson"/>

Various sources record her simply as having been sunk on May 24th by a German [[Q-ship|decoy ship]]<ref>e.g. a footnote by the editor of Goodhart's diary, which gives her as "sunk off Bornholm". The German ship is sometimes named as ''KE41''; [http://www.naval-history.net/WW1AreaBaltic1916.htm naval-history.net] refers simply to "decoy ship ''K''".</ref>, though this clashes with the known sinking on the 26th and the observations reported by Wilson and Goodhart in subsequent days. It is quite possible that this is a garbling of an encounter between one of the Russian submarines and a decoy vessel around the same time.

[[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] sent a telegram of condolences on the loss of ''E18'', and awarded Halahan the [[Order of St. George]], with the other two officers receiving the [[Order of St. Vladimir]] and each of the crew being posthumously awarded a medal. It is interesting to note that the Orders were not normally awarded posthumously.<ref name="Wilson"/> Two of ''E18's'' crew did not sail on her last mission; one, who had measles, later transferred to ''E19''. The other was ''E18's'' signalman Albert Edward Robinson who was replaced on this mission by ''E8's'' telegraphist for unknown reasons; he was later sent home in January 1917 and joined [[HMS E4|''E4'']] on her recommissioning.  The wreck of E18 has never been located .
