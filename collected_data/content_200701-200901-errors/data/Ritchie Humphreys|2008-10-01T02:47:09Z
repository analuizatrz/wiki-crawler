'''Richard John  Humphreys'''<ref name="Ritchie Humphreys">{{cite web |url=http://www.playerhistory.com/Default.aspx?page=player_details&playerID=31136 |title=Ritchie Humphreys |accessdate=2007-09-07 |publisher=Player History}}</ref> (born 30 November 1977) is an English [[Association football|footballer]], currently playing for [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in [[Football League One|League One]].

Humphreys started his career with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in 1996. Whilst with the club, he was loaned out to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. He left the club in 2001 and joined [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] for a short period, after which he joined current club [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]]. He joined [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on loan in 2006.

==Childhood and early career==
Humphreys was introduced to [[Association football|football]] from an early age, his [[grandfather]], [[Ernest Humphreys]], played for [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]]. His dad, John Humphreys, also had trials with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].<ref name="tearstocheers">{{cite book| first=Ritchie| last=Humphreys| title=From Tears to Cheers| publisher=Cheers Promotions| year=2003| id=ISBN 0-9545696-0-1| pages=Introduction}}</ref>

Humphreys grew up as a Sheffield United fan and joined their academy, which he described as a "dream come true". However, they released him when we he was 13.<ref name="tearstocheers">{{cite book| first=Ritchie| last=Humphreys| title=From Tears to Cheers| publisher=Cheers Promotions| year=2003| id=ISBN 0-9545696-0-1| pages=Introduction}}</ref> 

Humphreys then played for the Sheffield Boys and was one of their few players who did not play for a professional club. However, that soon changed when Humphreys was scouted by a [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] scout and he joined their centre of excellence.<ref name="tearstocheers">{{cite book| first=Ritchie| last=Humphreys| title=From Tears to Cheers| publisher=Cheers Promotions| year=2003| id=ISBN 0-9545696-0-1| pages=Introduction}}</ref>

==Sheffield Wednesday==
In 1995, after leaving [[Newfield Secondary School]], Humphreys became part of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]’s [[Youth system|youth squad]]. For the youth squad Humphreys played as a [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]] and was offered a professional contract.<ref name="tearstocheers">{{cite book| first=Ritchie| last=Humphreys| title=From Tears to Cheers| publisher=Cheers Promotions| year=2003| id=ISBN 0-9545696-0-1| pages=Introduction}}</ref> Due to the injuries of strikers [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]] and [[Mark Bright]], Wednesday manager [[David Pleat]] gave Humphreys the opportunity to go on Wednesday’s [[Season (sports)#Pre-season|pre-season]] tour of [[the Netherlands]].<ref name="tearstocheers">{{cite book| first=Ritchie| last=Humphreys| title=From Tears to Cheers| publisher=Cheers Promotions| year=2003| id=ISBN 0-9545696-0-1| pages=Introduction}}</ref>
 
Humphreys played the first game and scored twice. He then played in the second game against [[FC Utrecht]] and scored again. [[Johan Cruijff]] was the guest of honour for that game and he praised Humphreys and said he was the next [[Marco van Basten]]. It was during this pre season tour that he was taken under the wing and guidance of Wednesday legend Chris Waddle.  After scoring 4 goals in his first 5 premier league games lifting Wednesday to the top of the league, David Pleat decided to release his mentor Waddle.  Humphries didn't score another league goal all season (only notching a [[hat-trick#association football|hat-trick]] in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] game against Grimbsy Town in a 7&ndash;1 win). <ref name="tearstocheers">{{cite book| first=Ritchie| last=Humphreys| title=From Tears to Cheers| publisher=Cheers Promotions| year=2003| id=ISBN 0-9545696-0-1| pages=Introduction}}</ref><ref name="Humphreys dreams of Cardiff joy">{{cite news
