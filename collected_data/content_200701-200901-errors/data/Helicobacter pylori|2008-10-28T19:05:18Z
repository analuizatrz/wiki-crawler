'''''Helicobacter pylori''''' ({{pron-en|ˌhɛl<s>ɪ</s>kəˈbæktɚ pɪˈlɔəraɪ}}) is a [[gram-negative]], [[microaerophile|microaerophilic]] [[bacterium]] that inhabits various areas of the stomach and [[duodenum]]. It causes a chronic low-level [[inflammation]] of the stomach lining and is strongly linked to the development of duodenal and gastric [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s and stomach [[cancer bacteria|cancer]]. Over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are [[asymptomatic]]. 

The bacterium was initially named ''Campylobacter pyloridis'', then renamed ''C. pylori'' to fix a [[Latin grammar]] error.  When [[16S rRNA]] gene sequencing and other research showed in 1989 that the bacterium did not belong in the genus ''[[Campylobacter]]'', it was placed in its own [[genus]], ''[[Helicobacter]]''. The genus derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''hělix''/έλιξ "spiral" or "coil".<ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book

More than 50% of the world's population harbour ''H. pylori'' in their upper [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Infection is more prevalent in developing countries. The route of transmission is unknown, although individuals become infected in childhood. ''H. pylori'''s helix shape (from which the [[genus|generic]] name is derived) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the [[mucus|mucoid]] lining of the stomach.<ref name= YamaokaY>{{cite book

==Signs and symptoms==

Most individuals with chronic ''H. pylori'' infection have no symptoms. Some individuals develop more serious problems, including stomach or duodenal ulcers. Ulcers can cause a variety of symptoms or no symptoms at all. Common complaints include pain or discomfort (usually in the upper abdomen), bloating, feeling full after eating a small amount of food, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and dark or tar-colored stools. Ulcers that bleed can cause a low blood count and fatigue.<ref name="Suerbaum 2002">{{cite journal

==Prevention==
''H. pylori'' is a major cause of diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract.  Eradication of the infection in individuals will improve symptoms including dyspepsia, gastritis and peptic ulcers, and may prevent gastric cancer.  Rising antimicrobial resistance increases the need for a prevention strategy for the bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal

==Treatment==

Once ''H. pylori'' is detected in patients with a [[peptic ulcer]], the normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow the [[ulcer]] to heal. The standard first-line therapy is a one week ''triple therapy'' consisting of the antibiotics [[amoxicillin]] and [[clarithromycin]], and a [[proton pump inhibitor]] such as [[omeprazole]].<ref name=Mirbagheri_et_al_2006>{{cite journal

==Prognosis==

''H. pylori'' colonizes the stomach and induces chronic [[gastritis]], a long-lasting inflammation of the stomach. The bacterium persists in the stomach for decades in most people. Most individuals infected by ''H. pylori'' will never experience clinical symptoms despite having chronic gastritis. Approximately 10-20% of those colonized by ''H. pylori'' will ultimately develop gastric and duodenal ulcers.<ref name="pmid16847081">{{cite journal

Recent research states that genetic diversity in ''H. pylori'' decreases with geographic distance from East Africa, the birthplace of modern humans. Using the genetic diversity data, the researchers have created simulations that indicate the bacteria seems to have spread from East Africa around 58,000 years ago. Their results indicate modern humans were already infected by ''H. pylori'' before their migrations out of Africa, remaining associated with human hosts since that time.<ref>{{cite journal
