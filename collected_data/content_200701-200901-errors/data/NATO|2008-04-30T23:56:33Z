The '''North Atlantic Treaty Organization''' ('''NATO'''); {{lang-fr|'''Organisation du Traité de l'Atlantique  Nord''' ('''OTAN''')}}; (also called the ''North Atlantic Alliance'', the ''Atlantic Alliance'', or the ''Western Alliance'') is a [[military alliance]] established by the signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] on [[4 April]] [[1949]]. With headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]],<ref>Boulevard Leopold III-laan, B-1110 BRUSSELS, which is in Haren, part of the [[City of Brussels]]. {{citeweb|url=http://www.nato.int/|title=NATO homepage|accessdate=2006-03-07}}</ref> the organization established a system of [[collective defense|collective defence]] whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party.

==History of NATO==
===Beginnings===
The [[Treaty of Brussels]], signed on [[17 March]], [[1948]] by [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. This treaty established a military alliance, later to become the [[Western European Union]]. However, [[United States|American]] participation was thought necessary in order to counter the military power of the [[Soviet Union]], and therefore talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately.

These talks resulted in the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], which was signed in [[Washington, D.C.]] on [[4 April]] [[1949]]. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states, as well as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]]. Three years later, on [[18 February]] [[1952]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] also joined.

{{cquote|The Parties of NATO agreed that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all. Consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense will assist the Party or Parties being attacked, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.}}

"''Such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force''" does not necessarily mean that other member states will respond with military action against the aggressor(s). Rather they are obliged to respond, but maintain the freedom to choose how they will respond. This differs from Article IV of the Treaty of Brussels (which founded the Western European Union) which clearly states that the response must include military action. It is however often assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily. Further, the article limits the organization's scope to Europe and North America, which explains why the [[Falkland war|invasion of the British Falkland Islands]] did not result in NATO involvement.

The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1950 was crucial for NATO as it raised the apparent threat level greatly (all Communist countries were suspected of working together) and forced the alliance to develop concrete military plans.<ref>David C. Isby & Charles Kamps Jr, Armies of NATO's Central Front, Jane's Publishing Company Ltd 1985, p.13-14</ref> The 1952 Lisbon conference, seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO's Long-Term Defence Plan, called for an expansion to 96 [[division (military)|division]]s. However this requirement was dropped the following year to roughly 35 divisions with heavier use to be made of nuclear weapons. Also at Lisbon, the post of [[Secretary General of NATO]] as the organisation's chief civilian was also created, and Baron [[Hastings Ismay]] eventually appointed to the post.<ref>[[Time magazine]], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816183,00.html The Man with the Oilcan], March 24, 1952</ref> Later, in September 1952, the first major NATO maritime exercises began; [[Operation Mainbrace]] brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway. Meanwhile, while this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion ('[[Operation Gladio]]'), initially made by the [[Western European Union]], were being transferred to NATO control.

In 1954, the Soviet Union suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/nato/ |title=Fast facts |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> The NATO countries, fearing that the Soviet Union's motive was to weaken the alliance, ultimately rejected this proposal.

The incorporation of [[West Germany]] into the organization on [[9 May]] [[1955]] was described as "a decisive turning point in the history of our continent" by [[Halvard Lange]], Foreign Minister of Norway at the time.<ref>BBC On This Day "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/9/newsid_2519000/2519979.stm1955: West Germany accepted into Nato]" bbc.co.uk </ref> Indeed, one of its immediate results was the creation of the [[Warsaw Pact]], signed on [[14 May]] [[1955]] by the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and East Germany, as a formal response to this event, thereby delineating the two opposing sides of the [[Cold War]].

The unity of NATO was breached early on in its history, with a crisis occurring during [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency of France from 1958 onward. De Gaulle protested the United States' strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a [[special relationship]] between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] on [[17 September]] [[1958]], he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France, most notably [[Algeria]], where France was waging a counter-insurgency and sought NATO assistance.  

Considering the response given to be unsatisfactory, and in order to give France, in the event of a East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a NATO-Warsaw Pact global war, de Gaulle began to build an independent defence for his country. On [[11 March]] [[1959]], France withdrew its [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] [[Naval fleet|fleet]] from NATO command; three months later, in June 1959, de Gaulle banned the stationing of foreign [[nuclear weapon]]s on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the [[United States Air Force in France|ten major air force bases]] that had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967. 

In the meantime, France had initiated an [[Nuclear weapons and France|independent nuclear]] [[Mutually assured destruction|deterrence]] programme, spearheaded by the ''"[[Force de frappe]]"'' ("Striking force"). France tested its first nuclear weapon, ''[[Gerboise Bleue]]'', on [[13 February]] [[1960]], in (what was then) [[French Algeria]].
[[Image:Usaf-france-map.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Major [[United States Air Forces in Europe|USAF]] bases in France before [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s 1966 withdrawal from NATO military integrated command.]]
Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the [[Cuban missile crisis]] in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[English Channel|Channel]] fleets from NATO command. In 1966, all French armed forces were removed from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO troops were asked to leave France. This withdrawal forced the relocation of the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) from [[Paris]] to [[Casteau]], north of [[Mons]], Belgium, by [[16 October]] [[1967]]. France remained a member of the alliance, and committed to the defence of Europe from possible Communist attack with its own forces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany throughout this period. France rejoined NATO's Military Committee in 1995, and has since intensified working relations with the military structure.  France has not, however, rejoined the integrated military command and no non-French NATO troops are allowed to be based on its soil. The policies of current French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] appear to be aimed at eventual re-integration.

The creation of NATO necessitated the [[standardization]] of [[military technology]] and unified [[strategy]], through [[Command, Control and Communications]] centres (aka C4ISTAR). The [[STANAG]] (Standardization Agreement) insured such coherence. Hence, the [[7.62×51 NATO]] rifle cartridge was introduced in the 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. [[Fabrique Nationale]]'s [[FN FAL|FAL]] became the most popular 7.62 NATO rifle in Europe and served into the early 1990s. Also, [[Aircraft marshalling|aircraft marshalling signals]] were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base.

===Détente===
{{main|Détente}}
During most of the duration of the Cold War, NATO maintained a holding pattern with no actual military engagement as an organization. On [[1 July]] [[1968]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] opened for signature: NATO argued that its [[nuclear weapons sharing]] arrangements did not breach the treaty as U.S. forces controlled the weapons until a decision was made to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged.

On [[30 May]] [[1978]], NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further [[arms race]].

However, on [[12 December]] [[1979]], in light of a build-up of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of U.S. [[Cruise missile|Cruise]] and [[Pershing II]] theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position in regard to nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the [[Dual-Track Decision|Dual Track]] policy. Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact [[SS-20]] medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles able to reach Eastern capitals within minutes. This action led to [[peace movement]] protests throughout Western Europe.

===KAL 007 and NATO deployment of missiles in W. Europe===
With the background of the build-up of tension between the Soviet Union and the United States, NATO decided, under the impetus of the Reagan presidency, to deploy Pershing II and cruise missiles in Western Europe, primarily West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6 minutes striking distance from Moscow, the capital of the "Evil Empire", as Reagan had termed it. Yet support for the deployment was wavering and many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained. But on Sept. 1, 1983, the Soviet Union shot down [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], a Boeing 747 with 269 people aboard, in international waters just past the west coast of Sakhalin Island - an act which Reagan characterized as a "massacre". The barbarity of this act, as the U.S. and indeed the world understood it, galvanized support for the deployment - which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhael Gorbachev.

The membership of the organization in this time period likewise remained largely static. In 1974, as a consequence of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure, but, with Turkish cooperation, were readmitted in 1980. On [[30 May]] [[1982]], NATO gained a new member when, following a [[referendum]], the newly democratic [[Spain]] joined the alliance. 

In November 1983, NATO manoeuvres simulating a nuclear launch caused panic in the Kremlin. The Soviet leadership, led by ailing General Secretary [[Yuri Andropov]], became concerned that the manoeuvres, codenamed [[Able Archer 83]], were the beginnings of a genuine [[first strike]]. In response, Soviet nuclear forces were readied and air units in [[East Germany]] and [[Poland]] were placed on alert. Though at the time written off by U.S. intelligence as a propaganda effort, many historians now believe that the Soviet fear of a NATO first strike was genuine.

=== Post Cold War ===
The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1991 removed the ''de facto'' main adversary of NATO. This caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature and tasks. In practice this ended up entailing a gradual (and still ongoing) expansion of NATO to Eastern Europe, as well as the extension of its activities to areas that had not formerly been NATO concerns.
The first post-Cold War expansion of NATO came with the [[reunification of Germany]] on [[3 October]] [[1990]], when the former [[East Germany]] became part of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and the alliance. This had been agreed in the [[Two Plus Four Treaty]] earlier in the year. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east. The scholar [[Stephen F. Cohen]] has argued that a commitment was given that NATO would never expand further east,<ref>Gorbachev's Lost Legacy by Stephen F. Cohen [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050314/cohen (link)] [[The Nation]], [[February 24]], [[2005]]</ref> but this appears to be a misperception; no formal commitment of the sort was made.<ref>Robert B. Zoellick, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-65576869.html The Lessons of German Unification], [[The National Interest]], September 22, 2000</ref>

As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's military structure was cut back and reorganized, with new forces such as the [[Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps]] established. The 
[[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] agreed between NATO and the Warsaw Pact and signed in Paris in 1990, mandated specific reductions. The changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognised in the [[Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty]], signed some years later. 

The first NATO military operation caused by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was [[Operation Sharp Guard]], which ran from June 1993–October 1996. It provided maritime enforcement of the [[arms embargo]] and [[economic sanctions]] against the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On [[28 February]] [[1994]], NATO took its first military action, shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating a U.N.-mandated [[no-fly zone]] over central [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Operation Deny Flight]], the no-fly-zone enforcement mission, had begun a year before, on [[12 April]] [[1993]], and was to continue until [[20 December]] [[1995]]. NATO air strikes that year helped bring the [[Yugoslav wars|war in Bosnia]] to an end, resulting in the [[Dayton Agreement]], which in turn meant that NATO deployed a peacekeeping force, first named [[IFOR]] and then [[SFOR]].

Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbours were set up, like the [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] initiative and the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]]. On [[8 July]] [[1997]], three former communist countries, [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]], were invited to join NATO, which finally happened in 1999.

A NATO bombing campaign began in August, 1995, against the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], after the [[Srebrenica massacre]]. On [[24 March]] [[1999]], NATO saw its first broad-scale military engagement in the [[Kosovo War]], where it waged an 11-week bombing campaign, which NATO called [[Operation Allied Force]], against what was then the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], in an effort to stop Serbian-led ethnic cleansing. A formal declaration of war never took place (in common with all wars since World War II). The conflict ended on [[11 June]] [[1999]], when Yugoslavian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] agreed to NATO’s demands by accepting [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN resolution 1244]]. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to [[Albania]] as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from [[Kosovo]].<ref>[http://www.afsouth.nato.int/operations/harbour/ NATO website describing AFOR]</ref> NATO then helped establish the [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], a NATO-led force under a [[United Nations]] mandate that operated the military mission in Kosovo. 

The United States, the United Kingdom, and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the ongoing action against Yugoslavia, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed U.N. approval. The U.S./U.K. side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance, and they noted that [[Russia]] and [[China]] would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on [[Yugoslavia]], and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization.

=== After the September 11 attacks ===
[[Image:NATO Summit in Poiana Brasov 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|NATO Defence Ministers' Summit in [[Poiana Braşov]], 13-14 October 2004]]
The expansion of the activities and geographical reach of NATO grew even further as an outcome of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]]. These caused as a response the provisional invocation (on [[September 12]]) of the collective security of NATO's charter—Article 5 which states that any attack on a member state will be considered an attack against the entire group of members. The invocation was confirmed on [[4 October]] [[2001]] when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty.<ref>[http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm NATO Update: Invocation of Article 5 confirmed - 2 October 2001<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included the first two examples of military action taken in response to an invocation of Article 5: [[Operation Eagle Assist]] and [[Operation Active Endeavour]].
Operation Active Endeavour is a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea and is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general. It began on October 4, 2001.

Despite this early show of solidarity, NATO faced a crisis little more than a year later, when on [[10 February]] [[2003]], France and Belgium vetoed the procedure of silent approval concerning the timing of protective measures for Turkey in case of a possible war with [[Iraq]]. Germany did not use its right to break the procedure but said it supported the veto.

On the issue of [[Afghanistan]] on the other hand, the alliance showed greater unity: On [[16 April]] [[2003]] NATO agreed to take command of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two nations leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all 19 NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on [[11 August]], and marked the first time in NATO’s history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area. [[Canada]] had originally been slated to take over ISAF by itself on that date.

In January 2004, NATO appointed Minister [[Hikmet Çetin]], of Turkey, as the Senior Civilian Representative (SCR) in Afghanistan. Minister Cetin is primarily responsible for advancing the political-military aspects of the Alliance in Afghanistan. In August 2004, following U.S. pressure, NATO formed the [[NATO Training Mission - Iraq]], a training mission to assist the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the U.S. led [[MNF-I]].<ref>[[NATO Training Mission - Iraq]], [http://www.afsouth.nato.int/JFCN_Missions/NTM-I/NTMI_intro.htm Introduction], 17 September 2007</ref>

On [[31 July]] [[2006]], a NATO-led force, made up mostly of troops from Canada, Great Britain, Turkey and the Netherlands, took over [[Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan in 2006|military operations in the south of Afghanistan]] from a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition.

===Expansion and restructuring=== 
[[Image:NATO March 29 2004.jpg|250px|thumb|The NATO Secretary General, the U.S. President, and the Prime Ministers of Latvia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Estonia after a ceremony welcoming them into NATO on [[29 March]] [[2004]] at the [[Istanbul]] Summit.]]
New NATO structures were also formed while old ones were abolished: The [[NATO Response Force]] (NRF) was launched at the [[2002 Prague Summit of NATO|2002 Prague Summit]] on [[21 November]]. On [[19 June]] [[2003]], a major restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT), was established in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[USA]], and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of [[Allied Command Operations]] (ACO). ACT is responsible for driving transformation (future capabilities) in NATO, whilst ACO is responsible for current operations.

Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Northern European and Eastern European countries to NATO: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] and also [[Slovenia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Romania]]. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague Summit, and joined NATO on [[29 March]] [[2004]], shortly before the [[2004 Istanbul Summit]]. 
The same month, NATO's [[Baltic Air Policing]] began, which supported the sovereignty of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia by providing fighters to react to any unwanted aerial intrusions. Four fighters are based in Lithuania, provided in rotation by virtually all the NATO states. ''Operation Peaceful Summit'' temporarily enhanced this patrolling during the [[2006 Riga Summit]].<ref>L. NEIDINGER "NATO team ensures safe sky during Riga Summit" in ''[[Air Force Link]]'', [[December 8]], [[2006]], [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123034224]</ref>

A number of other countries have also expressed a wish to join the alliance, including [[Albania]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Ukraine]].  From the Russian point of view, NATO's eastward expansion since the end of the Cold War has been inconsistent with understandings between Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] which allowed for a peaceful [[German reunification|unification of Germany]]. NATO's expansion policy is seen as a continuation of a Cold War attempt to surround and isolate Russia.<ref>NATO Seeking to Weaken CIS by Expansion — Russian General [http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/12/01/balusaid.shtml (link)] MosNews 01.12.2005 and Ukraine moves closer to NATO membership By [[Taras Kuzio]] [http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=407&issue_id=3316&article_id=2369682 (Link)] Jamestown Foundation and Global Realignment [http://www.lrna.org/doc.4/globalre.html] and [http://english.pravda.ru/world/americas/04-05-2006/79870-rice-0 Condoleezza Rice wants Russia to acknowledge USA's interests on post-Soviet space], [[Pravda]] 04.05.2006</ref>

The [[2006 NATO summit]] was held in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], which had joined the Atlantic Alliance two years earlier. It is the first [[NATO summit]] to be held in a country that was part of the [[Soviet Union]], and the second one in a former [[COMECON]] country (after the [[2002 Prague Summit]]). Energy Security was one of the main themes of the Riga Summit.<ref>{{cite paper | author=Nazemroaya, Mahdi Darius | title=The Globalization of Military Power: NATO Expansion | publisher=Centre for Research on Globalization |date=May 17, 2007 | url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=NAZ20070517&articleId=5677}}</ref>

At the April 2008 summit in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], NATO agreed to the accession of [[Croatia]] and [[Albania]] and invited them to join.  The membership of [[Republic of Macedonia | Macedonia]] was vetoed by [[Greece]], while [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] were told that they will eventually become members.<ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/03/nato.members/index.html</ref>

===Involvement in Afghanistan: Taking over ISAF===
[[Image:NATO expansion.png|thumb|230px|Current membership of NATO in Europe.]]
{{main|International Security Assistance Force}}
In August 2003, NATO commenced its first mission ever outside Europe when it assumed control over [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in [[Afghanistan]]. However, some critics feel that [[national caveats]] or other restrictions undermine the efficiency of ISAF. For instance, political scientist [[Joseph Nye]] stated in a 2006 article that "many NATO countries with troops in Afghanistan have 'national caveats' that restrict how their troops may be used. While the Riga summit relaxed some of these caveats to allow assistance to allies in dire circumstances, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and the U.S. are doing most of the fighting in southern Afghanistan, while French, German, and Italian troops are deployed in the quieter north. Due to the intensity of the fighting in the south, France has recently allowed a squadron of [[Mirage 2000]] fighter/attack aircraft to be moved into the area, to [[Kandahar International Airport|Khandahar]], in order to reinforce the alliance's efforts.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3232,36-949296@51-947771,0.html LeMonde.fr : La France et l'OTAN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is difficult to see how NATO can succeed in stabilizing Afghanistan unless it is willing to commit more troops and give commanders more flexibility."<ref> J. NYE, "NATO after Riga", 14 December 2006, http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/nye40</ref> If these caveats were to be eliminated, it is argued that this could help NATO to succeed.

===NATO missile defence talks controversy===
For some years, the United States negotiated with [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] for the deployment of interceptor missiles and a radar tracking system in the two countries. Both countries' governments indicated that they would allow the deployment. The proposed American missile defence site in Central Europe is believed to be fully operational in 2015 and would be capable of covering most of Europe except part of Romania plus Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey.<ref name=xinhuanet20070419>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-04/19/content_6001014.htm Xinhua - English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In April 2007, NATO's European allies called for a NATO missile defence system which would complement the American [[National Missile Defense]] system to protect Europe from missile attacks and NATO's decision-making North Atlantic Council held consultations on missile defence in the first meeting on the topic at such a senior level.<ref name=xinhuanet20070419/>

In response, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] claimed that such a deployment could lead to a new arms race and could enhance the likelihood of mutual destruction. He also suggested that his country should freeze its compliance with the 1990 [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE)—which limits military deployments across the continent—until all NATO countries had ratified the [[adapted CFE treaty]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6594379.stm BBC NEWS | Europe | Russia in defence warning to US<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Secretary General [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] said the system would not affect strategic balance or threaten Russia, as the plan is to base only 10 interceptor missiles in [[Poland]] with an associated radar in the Czech Republic.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6570533.stm BBC NEWS | Europe | Nato chief dismisses Russia fears<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On July 14, Russia notified its intention to suspend the CFE treaty, effective 150 days later.

Separately, NATO has just decided to establish a cyber-defence agency to assist its member states,<ref>http://news.zdnet.co.uk/security/0,1000000189,39382597,00.htm</ref> in addition to the already-existing internal computer network defence team.

===Future enlargement of NATO===
{{main|Enlargement of NATO}}
<!-- All commentary on potential future members belongs at Enlargement of NATO; only single sentence summaries should be added here -->
In addition to the above listed members, Macedonia was under consideration to enter NATO in 2009 but was not agreed upon. Macedonia is likely to enter the alliance at some point, with [[Jane's Defence Weekly]] commenting on 16 April 2008 that resolution to the naming issue that is holding up entry is 'likely by the end of this year [2008] and no later than the 2009 summit.'<ref>Jim Dorschner & Radu Tudor, 'Questions remain after NATO summit,' JDW 16 April 2008, p.18</ref> At the same 2008 summit in Bucharest, the communique explicitly said that [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Ukraine]] 'will become members of NATO.'

Other potential candidate countries include, in South-eastern Europe, Bosnia & Hercegovina, Serbia, and Montengro. Other possible, long neutral countries that might become members are [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].

===Euro-Atlantic Partnership===
{{main|Partnership for Peace|Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council}}

A double framework has been established to help further co-operation between the 26 NATO members and 23 "partner countries".

* The '''Partnership for Peace (PfP)''' programme was established in 1994 and is based on individual bilateral relations between each partner country and NATO: each country may choose the extent of its participation. The PfP programme is considered the operational wing of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership.<ref>http://www.nato.int/issues/pfp/index.html http://www.nato.int/pfp/sig-date.html</ref>
* The '''Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC)''' on the other hand was first established on [[29 May]] [[1997]], and is a forum for regular coordination, consultation and dialogue between all 49 participants.<ref>[http://www.nato.int/issues/eapc/index.html NATO Topics: The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The 23 partner countries are the following:

===Individual Partnership Action Plans===
Launched at the November 2002 Prague Summit, [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]]s (IPAPs) are open to countries that have the political will and ability to deepen their relationship with NATO.<ref>[http://www.nato.int/issues/ipap/index.html NATO Topics: Individual Partnership Action Plans<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Currently '''IPAPs''' are in implementation with the following countries:

* {{flag|Georgia}} ([[29 october]] [[2004]])

==Structures==
===Political structure===
[[Image:Bush dehoopscheffer.jpg|thumb|[[Secretary General of NATO|Secretary General]] [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] meeting [[George W. Bush]] on [http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060320-1.html March 20, 2006].]]
Like any alliance, NATO is ultimately governed by its 26 member states. However, the [http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/treaty.htm North Atlantic Treaty], and other agreements, outline how decisions are to be made within NATO. Each of the 26 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO’s headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].<ref>{{cite web | title = National delegations to NATO What is their role? | publisher = NATO | date = [[2007-06-18]] | url = http://www.nato.int/issues/national_delegations/tasks.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}</ref> The senior permanent member of each delegation is known as the Permanent Representative and is generally a senior [[civil servant]] or an experienced [[ambassador]] (and holding that diplomatic rank). 

Together the Permanent Members form the [[North Atlantic Council]] (NAC), a body which meets together at least once a week and has effective political authority and powers of decision in NATO. 
From time to time the Council also meets at higher levels involving [[Foreign Minister]]s, [[Defence Minister]]s or Heads of State or Government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO’s policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. [[NATO summit]]s also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.

The meetings of the North Atlantic Council are chaired by the [[Secretary General of NATO]] and, when decisions have to be made, action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each nation represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions.

The second pivotal member of each country's delegation is the Military Representative, a senior officer from each country's armed forces. Together the Military Representatives form the Military Committee (MC), a body responsible for recommending to NATO’s political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and is responsible for the overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council. 
Like the council, from time to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of defence, the most senior military officer in each nation's armed forces.  The Defence Planning Committee excludes France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from NATO's integrated military structure.<ref>{{cite web | first = Eide | last = Espen Barth | coauthors = Frédéric Bozo | title = Should NATO play a more political role? | work = Nato Review| publisher = NATO | date = Spring 2005 | url = http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2005/issue1/english/debate.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}</ref> On a practical level, this means that issues that are acceptable to most NATO members but unacceptable to France may be directed to the Defence Planning Committee for more expedient resolution.  Such was the case in the lead up to [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Thomas | last = Fuller | title = Reaching accord, EU warns Saddam of his 'last chance' | work =  International Herald Tribune | date = [[2003-02-18]] | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/02/18/eu_ed3__1.php | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}</ref>

The current Chairman of the NATO Military Committee is [[Ray Henault]] of [[Canada]] (since 2005).

The [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]], presided by [[José Lello]], is made up of legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as 13 associate members.<ref>[http://www.nato-pa.int/Default.asp?SHORTCUT=1 NATO PA - About the NATO Parliamentary Assembly<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is however officially a different structure from NATO, and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies.

Subordinate to the political structure are the International Staff and International Military Staff, which adminster NATO programmes and carry out high-level political, military, and also civil emergency planning.<ref>[[NATO]] Handbook 2001, [http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb0809.htm]</ref>

===Military structure===

[[Image:Nato awacs.jpg|thumb|right|240px|NATO [[E-3 Sentry|E-3A]] flying with [[United States Air Force|US]] [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] in a NATO exercise.]] 

NATO's military operations are directed by the [[Chairman of the Military Committee|Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]], and split into two Strategic Commands both commanded by a senior US officer assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the [[Chairman of the Military Committee|Military Committee]] for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command.

Before 2003 the Strategic Commanders were the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR) and the [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] (SACLANT) but the current arrangement is to separate [[command responsibility]] between [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT), responsible for transformation and training of NATO forces, and [[Allied Command Operations]], responsible for NATO operations world wide.

The commander of Allied Command Operations retained the title "Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)", and is based in the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) located at [[Casteau]], north of the [[Belgian]] city of [[Mons]]. This is about 80 km (50 miles) south of NATO’s political headquarters in Brussels. ACO is headed by [[SACEUR]], a US four star general with the dual-hatted role of heading [[United States European Command|US European Command]], which is headquartered in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. SHAPE was in Paris until 1966, when French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] withdrew French forces from the Atlantic Alliance. NATO's headquarters were then forced to move to Belgium, while many military units had to move. 

ACO includes [[Joint Force Command Brunssum]] in the Netherlands, [[Allied Joint Force Command Naples|Joint Force Command Naples]] in Italy, and [[Joint Command Lisbon]], all multinational headquarters with many nations represented. JFC Brunssum has its land component, [[Joint Force Command Brunssum#Land Component, Heidelburg|Allied Land Component Command Headquarters Heidelberg]] at [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]], its air component at [[Allied Air Forces Central Europe|Ramstein]] in Germany, and its naval component at the [[Northwood Headquarters]] in the northwest suburbs of [[London]]. JFC Naples has its land component in Madrid, air component at Izmir, Turkey, and naval component in Naples, Italy. It also directs [[KFOR]] in Kosovo. JC Lisbon is a smaller HQ with no subordinate commands. [[Lajes Field]], in the Portuguese Azores, is an important transatlantic staging post.

[[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT) is based in the former Allied Command Atlantic headquarters in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[USA]]. Allied Command Atlantic, usually known as [[SACLANT]] (Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic), after its commander, became ACT in 2003. It is headed by the the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT), a US four-star general or admiral with the dual-hatted role as commander [[United States Joint Forces Command|US Joint Forces Command]] (COMUSJFCOM). There is also an 
ACT command element located at SHAPE in Mons, Belgium. 

Subordinate ACT organisations include the [[Joint Warfare Center|Joint Warfare Centre]] (JWC) located in Stavanger, Norway (in the same site as the [[Norwegian Defence Force|Norwegian NJHQ]]); the [[Joint Force Training Centre]] (JFTC) in Bydgoszcz, [[Poland]]; the [[Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre]] (JALLC) in Monsanto, Portugal; and the [[NATO Undersea Research Centre]] (NURC), La Spezia, Italy.

== NATO bases ==
''Further information: [[:Category:Military facilities of NATO|Category:Military facilities of NATO]]''

NATO bases can be divided into two categories: national military facilities of NATO members, sometimes located in another NATO member country, such as Dutch and British army bases in Germany during the [[Cold War]], and multinational bases with NATO multinational units in residence. 

Multinational NATO bases with NATO specific units include the [[NATO Defence College]], [[NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen]] in Germany where a jointly funded fleet of [[E-3 Sentry]] [[AWACS]] airborne radar aircraft is located, and, in 2008, [[Pápa]] in [[Hungary]], where the [[C-17]]s of the [[NATO Strategic Airlift Capability]] will be located.

== Research and Technology at NATO ==
NATO operates several research and technology organisations (this is not a complete list): 
*'''[[NATO Undersea Research Centre]] (NURC)''',<ref>[http://www.nurc.nato.int NURC Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> reporting directly to the Supreme [[Allied Command Transformation]];
*'''[[Research and Technology Agency]] (RTA)''',<ref>[http://www.rta.nato.int NATO Research & Technology Organisation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> reporting to the [[NATO Research and Technology Organisation]] (RTO);
*'''[[NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency]] (NC3A)''',<ref>[http://www.nc3a.nato.int NATO C3 Agency<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> reporting to the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Organisation (NC3O). The [[SHAPE Technical Centre]] (STC) in [[The Hague]] (Netherlands) merged in 1996 with the NATO Communications and Information Systems Operating and Support Agency (NACOSA) based in Brussels (Belgium), forming the [[NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency]] (NC3A). The agency comprises around 650 staff, of which around 400 are located in The Hague and 250 in Brussels. It reports to the [[NATO Consultation, Command and Control Board]] (NC3B).
*'''[[NATO Communications and Information Systems Agency]] (NCSA)''',<ref>[http://www.ncsa.nato.int NATO Communication and Information Systems Agency<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> based in [[Mons]] (BEL), was established in August 2004 from the former NATO Communications and Information Systems Operating and Support Agency (NACOSA).
*'''[[NACMA|NATO ACCS Management Agency]] (NACMA)''', based in Brussels, manages around a hundred persons in charge of the [[Air Control and Command System]] (ACCS) due for 2009.

==List of NATO operations==
In [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991–2001):
*[[Operation Deliberate Force]] (August–September 1995); bombing of the [[Republika Srpska]] during the [[Bosnian War]].
*[[Operation Joint Endeavor]] (December 1995–1996); first peacekeeping operation in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
*[[SFOR|Operation Joint Guard/Joint Forge]] (December 1996–December 2004); second peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
*[[Operation Essential Harvest]] (August–September 2001); disarmament of ethnic Albanian militias in the [[Republic of Macedonia]].
