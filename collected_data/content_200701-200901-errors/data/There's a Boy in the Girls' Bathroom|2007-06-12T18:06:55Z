'''''There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom''''' is a juvenile fiction book from the author [[Louis Sachar]].

==Plot==

Bradley Chalkers is the [[protagonist]] of the book. In his school, his teachers and fellow classmates prefer to ignore him. He sits at the back of the class, last desk, last row, and never pays any attention, preferring to cut up pieces of paper or partake in other mindless tasks which keep his mind off the lesson. He is proud whenever he receives ''[[F]]'' on his class tests. He wants everyone to hate him, because then they will leave him alone.

But then a new classmate, Jeff Fishkin, comes in from [[Washington DC]], and the only remaining seat is beside Bradley. The classmate tries to reason with Bradley, but fails like everyone else and drifts away with other friends. Then a [[School Counselor|counselor]] is appointed called Carla, and she cannot wait to meet Bradley. Carla says she wants to be friends with Bradley, and she begins to try to open him up and reveal his kind interior which he has been trying to hide. But Bradley refuses to come quietly, and his conflicting emotions with Carla and other people induces strife among his fellow schoolmates.

A subplot of the book involves Jeff and a girl named Colleen Verigold (described as having "red hair and a freckled face"), who seem to have crushes on each other. Bradley thinks girls are gross, and especially hates Colleen's best friend, the tomboyish Melinda Birch. Towards the end of the book, as Carla helps Bradley change, he is invited to Colleen's birthday party along with Jeff (and he even wins the party games and gets a harmonica as a prize).
