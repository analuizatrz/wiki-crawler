[[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s '''Violin Concerto in E Minor, Op. 64''' is his last large orchestral work and an important piece in the violin repertoire. It is one of the best loved violin concertos of all time.<ref>{{cite web||url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artist/zdxm|accessdate=2007-04-26|title=BBC Mendelssohn Profile}}</ref><ref>{{cite web||url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravikant/hw4/mendelssohn.html|accessdate=27-04-28|title=Mendelssohn on University of Chicago Site}}</ref><ref name="dov">Mendelssohn, F.

== History ==

In [[1835 in music|1835]], Mendelssohn was appointed as principal [[conductor]] of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]]<ref name="cam">Mercer-Taylor, P. J. ''The Cambridge Companion to Mendelssohn'', CUP (2004)</ref> and soon appointed his childhood friend [[Ferdinand David]] as [[concertmaster]].<ref name="mt">"Ferdinand David", ''Musical Times'' Vol. 47, No. 761</ref> It was from this period that the work owes its origins. In a letter dated [[30 July]] [[1838 in music|1838]], Mendelssohn wrote to David:<ref name="let">Dr. Rietz, J. ''Letters of Felix Mendelssohn, 1833 – 1847'', Ayer (1970)</ref>

<blockquote>"I should like to write a violin concerto for you next winter. One in E minor runs through my head, the beginning of which gives me no peace."</blockquote>

Mendelssohn, however, would be distracted by other matters and the concerto would take another six years to complete. During this time, Mendelssohn and David kept regular correspondence,<ref name="let"/> and Mendelssohn would regularly seek technical and compositional advice. This kind of input from a violinist was a first for a major violin concerto and was a forerunner of many other composer/violinist collaborations.<ref name="sb">Steinberg, M. ''The Concerto: A Listener's Guide'', OUP (1998)</ref>  The autographed score is dated [[16 September]] [[1844 in music|1844]], but Mendelssohn was still seeking advice from David on the piece until its premiere.<ref name="mt"/> Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto was first performed in [[Leipzig]] on [[13 March]] [[1845 in music|1845]] with Ferdinand David as soloist and Danish composer [[Niels Gade]] as conductor.<ref name="sb"/> Mendelssohn was unable to conduct the premiere due to illness.

== Instrumentation ==

The work is scored for solo violin and a standard classical orchestra consisting of two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, two [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s, two [[trumpet]]s, [[timpani]], and [[string section|strings]].<ref name="dov"/><ref name="sb"/>

== Movements ==
The concerto is in three [[movement (music)|movements]]:

# Allegro molto appassionato
# Andante
# Allegretto non troppo - Allegro molto vivace

=== Allegro molto appassionato ===
'''''12 – 14 minutes'''''
[[Image:Mendelssohn_VnConcert_op64_1mvt_1theme.png|thumb|right|300px|The opening of the ''Violin Concerto'']]

The concerto opens with an almost immediate entry of the solo violin playing an elegiac melody. This theme is restated by the orchestra and then followed by a fretful chromatic passage. The music subsides into a tranquil second subject melody played initially by woodwind with a bass note provided by the soloist. The opening theme and the chromatic theme are then combined in the trance-like development section. The flamboyant cadenza serves as a link to the recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. The music gathers energy in the coda. 

=== Andante ===
'''''8 – 9 minutes'''''
[[Image:Mendelssohn_VnConcert_op64_2mvt.png|thumb|right|300px|The main theme of the ''Andante'']]

The bassoon sustains its note from the final chord of the first movement into the lyrical C major slow movement, characterized by Mendelssohn’s warm expressiveness, a subtle blend of bliss and melancholy. The theme to the darker middle section is then introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. Here the soloist is able to demonstrate his or her nimble dexterity before the music returns to the lyrical theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.

=== Allegretto non troppo - Allegro molto vivace ===
'''''6 minutes'''''

Following the second movement, there is brief transitional passage for solo violin and strings only. This leads into the vivacious E major finale, whose opening is marked by a call from the brass. The opening theme requires dazzling passage work from the soloist, while the orchestral parts also are given ample opportunity to sparkle with the later themes. The movement is in sonata form; the recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a lyrical countermelody in the strings in the first subject. The concerto concludes with a frenetic coda.

== Analysis ==

The concerto is innovative in many respects. Firstly, the solo violin plays from the outset, whereas Classical concertos typically open with an orchestral exposition followed by version of essentially the same material that incorporates the soloist. Secondly, the soloist does not merely play melodies, but also provides accompaniment on numerous occasions, such as the ricochet arpeggios at the start of the recapitulation. Thirdly, three movements are to be played without pause, imposing a sense of unity, and a reference back to the first movement occurs in the second, suggesting [[cyclic form|cyclical form]].

Mendelssohn's concerto is one of the most frequently performed violin concerti, and along with its more grandiose counterparts by [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Beethoven]], [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Brahms]] and [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Bruch)|Bruch]], has become a cornerstone of the violin repertoire. In 1906, the year before his death, celebrated violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] told the guests at his 75th birthday party:<ref name="sb"/>

<blockquote>"The Germans have four violin concertos. The greatest, most uncompromising is [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Beethoven's]]. The [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|one by Brahms]] vies with it in seriousness.  The richest, the most seductive, was written by [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Bruch)|Max Bruch]]. But the most inward, the heart's jewel, is Mendelssohn's."</blockquote>

The work has developed a reputation as an essential work for all aspiring violin virtuosi to conquer. Even so, the concerto is still technically challenging and is generally considered to be as difficult as many other famous counterparts.<ref name="vm">{{cite web||url=http://violinmasterclass.com/repertoire.php?type=orch#8|title=Violin Masterclass' Graded Repertoire}}</ref> 

Mendelssohn also wrote a [[Concerto for Violin and Strings (Mendelssohn)|violin concerto with strings]] in 1822, which was given its [[20th century]] premiere in 1952 by [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and is less often played and recorded.
