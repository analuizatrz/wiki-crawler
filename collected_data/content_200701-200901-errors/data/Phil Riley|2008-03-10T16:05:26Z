'''Phil Riley''' (48) was Chief Executive of [[Chrysalis Group|Chrysalis Radio]] from June 1999 to July 2007, having played a major role in establishing Chrysalis Radio as one of the leading new entrants in the UK radio industry. Phil resigned his post after leading the successful sale of [[Chrysalis Radio]] to private company [[Global Radio]] in July 2007.

Riley's radio career started in 1980, when he joined [[Birmingham]]'s [[96.4 BRMB]] as a graduate trainee. In 1990 he was appointed managing director of [[Leeds]]' [[96.3 Radio Aire]], which he managed from near-bankruptcy to profitability. He left in 1994 to join the newly-formed Chrysalis Radio as Managing Director of its first station, [[100.7 Heart FM]] in Birmingham - a role he reprised the following year for sister-station [[Heart 106.2]] in London.

Phil was active in the development of digital radio, sitting on the board of the [[Digital Radio Development Bureau]] (DRDB), as well as chairing multiplex consortium [[MXR]] (in which Chrysalis was the lead shareholder). On a wider industry level, Phil held main board memberships of [[The Radio Centre]] (formerly the CRCA and RAB) for over ten years. He also sat on the [[Rajar Board]]. Phil has an MBA (specialising in Marketing) from [[Columbia Business School]].

He now advises media company boards on strategy matters, and at the end of 2007 was named Executive Chairman of a bid for [[EMAP Radio]], backed by Private Equity group [[Vitruvian partners]].
