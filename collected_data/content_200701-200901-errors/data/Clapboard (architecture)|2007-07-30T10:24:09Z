'''Clapboard''', also known as '''bevel siding''' or '''lap siding''' or '''weather-board''' (with regional variants as to the exact definitions of these terms), is a [[board]] used typically for exterior horizontal [[siding]] that has one edge thicker than the other and where the board above laps over the one below. It is often found in [[New England]] architecture.

In newer, cheaper construction, clapboard is often imitated as "[[siding]]" made of [[vinyl siding|vinyl]], [[aluminum]], or [[fiber cement siding|fiber cement]].
