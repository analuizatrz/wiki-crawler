'''Indonesia''', officially the '''Republic of Indonesia''' ([[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]]: ''Republik Indonesia''), is a [[island nation|nation of 17,508 islands]]<ref name="USCONGRESS">{{cite web| title=Country Profile: Indonesia| publisher=[[Library of Congress|U.S Library of Congress]]| date=December 2004| url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Indonesia.pdf  | accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> in [[South East Asia]], and the world's largest [[Archipelago|archipelagic]] state. With a population of over 200 million, it is the world's fourth [[List of countries by population|most populous]] country and the most populous [[Muslim]]-majority nation. With a democratically elected parliament and [[President of Indonesia|president]], Indonesia is considered the world's third largest democracy (after [[India]] and the [[United States]]).<ref>{{cite journal| author=Eric G.

The Indonesian archipelago, home of the [[Spice Islands]], has been an important trade destination since at least the time of the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Kingdom]] with whom seventh century [[China|Chinese]] sailors traded.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman|title=Indonesia |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |pages=pp.22-26 |id=ISBN 0-300-10518-5}}</ref> Indonesia's history has been influenced by numerous foreign powers that were drawn to the archipelago by its wealth of natural resources; these have included [[India]]ns, under whose influence [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] kingdoms flourished beginning in the early centuries CE, [[Muslim]] traders who spread [[Islam]] from the thirteenth century,<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pages 3 to 14.</ref> and [[Europe]]ans who fought for monopolization of the spice trade during the [[Age of Exploration]]. A [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial presence]] existed in Indonesia for over three centuries; however, Indonesian [[Indonesian independence|independence]] was declared in 1945 and which received official international recognition four years later. Indonesia's post-independence history has been turbulent, with political instability including separatism and corruption, periods of rapid economic growth and decline, natural disaster, and a [[Reformation (Indonesia)|democratization]] process since 1998.

Indonesia is a [[unitary state]] consisting of numerous distinct ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups spread across its numerous islands that have not always been united. However, a shared history of [[colonialism]], [[Indonesian National Revolution|rebellion against it]], a [[Indonesian language|national language]], and a [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim majority population]] have helped to define Indonesia as a state and nation.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 256</ref> Indonesia's national motto, ''"Bhinneka tunggal ika"'' ("Unity in diversity", derived from [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]]), reflects the amalgamation of a myriad cultures, languages, and [[ethnic group]]s that shape every aspect of the country.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 256</ref> Sectarian tensions and separatism, however, have threatened political stability in some regions, leading to violent confrontations.

It was upon this trade, and the [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] that was brought with it, that the [[Sriwijaya]] kingdom flourished from the seventh century CE. It became a powerful naval state, growing wealthy on the international trade it controlled through the region until its decline in the twelfth century. During the eighth and tenth centuries CE, the agriculturally-based Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and Hindu [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]] dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, building grand religious monuments such as Sailendra's [[Borobudur]] and Mataram's [[Prambanan]]. The Hindu [[Majapahit]] kingdom was founded in East Java in the late thirteenth century, and under its mid fourteenth century military commander, [[Gajah Mada]], its influence stretched over much of modern day Indonesia. This period is often referred to as a "Golden Age" of Indonesian history.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The next great empire |author=Peter Lewis |journal=Futures |volume=14 |issue=1 |date=1982 |pages=47-61 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-3287(82)90071-4}}</ref>

Indonesia is a [[republic]] with a [[presidential system]]. Being a [[unitary state]], power is concentrated in the national government. Following the [[Indonesian Revolution of 1998|downfall of the Suharto administration]] in 1998, Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms. The [[Constitution of Indonesia|1945 Constitution of Indonesia]] has been amended four times in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. [[Executive (government)|Executive]], [[judicial]] and [[legislative]] branches were revamped, creating a newly liberal democratic [[political system]].<ref name="Harijanti2006">{{cite journal |title=Indonesia: General elections test the amended Constitution and the new Constitutional Court |journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law |author=Susi Dwi Harijanti and Tim Lindsey |volume=4 |issue=1 |date=2006 |pages=138-150 |doi=10.1093/icon/moi055}}</ref>

The [[President of Indonesia]] is the [[head of state]], [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian armed forces]], and responsible for domestic governance, policy-making and foreign affairs. The president appoints a council of ministers, who are not required to be elected members of the legislature.

The highest representative body at national level is the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR). Its main functions include supporting and amending the [[Constitution of Indonesia|Constitution]], inauguration of the President and the fomalization of broad outlines of state policy; MPR has the power to impeach the President.<ref>{{id icon}} {{cite book |title=Ketetapan MPR-RI Nomor II/MPR/2000 tentang Perubahan Kedua Peraturan Tata Tertib Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat Republik Indonesia |author=People's Consultative Assembly (MPR-RI) |authorlink=People's Consultative Assembly |url=http://www.mpr.go.id/pdf/ketetapan/putusan%20MPRRI%202000.pdf |accessdate=2006-11-07}}</ref> MPR contains two [[lower house]] of representatives; the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) with 550 members and the [[Regional Representatives Council]] (DPD) with 168 members.

The DPR is the legislative body which passes legislation and monitors the executive branch. Members of the DPR are elected for five-year terms on a [[proportional representation]] basis from more than two thousand [[Constituency|electoral districts]].<ref name="Harijanti2006"/> Since 1998, the DPR's role and influence has increased markedly, including: total control of [[statute]]s production without executive branch interventions; all members are now elected ([[Reserved political positions|reserved seats]] for military representatives have now been removed); and the introduction of some fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR.<ref name="Harijanti2006"/><ref name="ECONOMIST_FACTSHEET">{{cite web |title=Indonesia:Factsheet |last= |url=http://www.economist.com/countries/Indonesia/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet |work=Country Briefings|publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=3 Oct 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> The DPD is a new chamber, based on the 2001 constitution amendment.

The Indonesia [[judicial system]] comprises several [[court]]s; the highest is the [[Supreme Court]]. Most civil disputes appear first before a State Court; from which [[appeal]]s can be heard before the High Court. The Supreme Court can hear a final [[cassation]] appeal or conduct a case review if there is new evidence. Apart from civil courts, Indonesia has a Commercial Court to handle [[bankruptcy]] and [[insolvency]]; a State Administrative Court to hear [[administrative law]] cases against the government; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law products, general elections, dissolution of political parties, and the scope of authority of a state institution; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases.<ref name="USCONGRESS"/>

[[Military of Indonesia|Indonesia's armed forces]] (TNI) total about 300,000 members, including the Army (TNI-AD), Navy (including marines), and Air Force.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel.

In the freer political environment of the post-Suharto years, the role of religion, particularly Islam, in society and politics is hotly debated. The current "anti-pornography" bill before Parliament, for example, is aimed not only at publications and movies, but also at outlawing immodest dress and public displays of affection such as kissing and dancing. Its supporters argue that it is a necessity to maintain moral standards; its detractors maintain it would be an unwelcome control of individual freedoms and would be discriminatory towards women in particular.<ref>{{cite video |people=Peter Cave, Mark Colvin |title=Indonesian women rally against anti-pornography bill |medium=TV Current Affairs |publisher=Lateline, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location=Sydney |date=[[8 March]] [[2006]]}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
[[Image:Indonesia_provinces_english.png|right|thumb|320px|Map of the provinces of Indonesia]]
{{main|Provinces of Indonesia|Subdivisions of Indonesia}}
Administratively, Indonesia consists of [[Provinces of Indonesia|thirty-three provinces]] (four of which have special status) including a special capital region. Each has its own political legislature and is headed by a governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies (''[[Regencies of Indonesia|kabupaten]]'') and (''[[Cities of Indonesia|kotamadya]]''), which are further subdivided into subdistricts (''[[Subdistricts of Indonesia|kecamatan]]''), and again into village groupings (''[[kelurahan]]''). Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, the 440 districts or regencies have become the key administrative units responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is one of the most influential on citizen's daily lives and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected ''lurah'' or ''kepala desa'' (village chief).

===Special Regions===
Four provinces have special status: [[Aceh]], [[Jakarta]], [[Yogyakarta (special region)|Yogyakarta]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. Special Region status provides greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the [[central government]] in comparison to other provinces. The Acehnese government, for example, has the right to create an independent legal system; in 2003, it instituted a form of ''[[sharia]]'' (Islamic law).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michelle Ann Miller |title=The Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam law: a serious response to Acehnese separatism? |journal=Asian Ethnicity |volume=5 |issue=3 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/caet/2004/00000005/00000003/art00005 |date=2004 |pages=333&ndash;351 |doi=10.1080/1463136042000259789}}</ref> Yogyakarta was granted the status of 'Special Region' as recognition for is pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]];<ref>[http://www.gtzsfdm.or.id/documents/archive/Law5_1974.pdf Indonesia Law No. 5/1974 Concerning Basic Principles on Administration in the Region] (''translated version'').

Major agricultural products include [[palm oil]], [[rice]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[spice]]s and [[rubber]]. 

Indonesia's main export markets are [[Japan]] (22.3% of Indonesian exports in 2005), the [[United States]] (13.9%), [[China]] (9.1%), and [[Singapore]] (8.9%). The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan (18.0%), China (16.1%), and Singapore (12.8%). In 2005, Indonesia ran a [[trade surplus]] with [[export]] revenues of US$83.64 billion and [[import]] expenditure of US$62.02 billion. The country has extensive natural resources, including [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[tin]], [[copper]], and [[gold]]. Indonesia's major imports include [[machinery]] and [[equipment]], [[chemicals]], [[fuels]], and [[foodstuffs]].<ref name='indoCIA'/>

Despite its immense [[natural resources]] and [[agricultural]] productivity, prosperity has often failed to be equitable. Following independence, the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability, a young inexperienced government, and ill-disciplined [[economic nationalism]]. By the time of [[Overthrow of Sukarno|Sukarno's downfall]] in the mid-1960s, the economy was in chaos with 1,000% annual [[inflation]], shrinking export revenues, crumbling [[infrastructure]], factories operating at minimal capacity, and negligible [[Investment#Economics|investment]], resulting in severe poverty and hunger.<ref name='SCHWARZ'>{{cite book |last=Schwarz |first=Adam |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s |publisher=Allen & Unwin |date=1994 |location=[[Sydney]] |pages=52-57 |url= |doi= |id=ISBN 978-1-86373-665-0}}</ref> The [[Orde Baru|New Order]] administration brought [[Berkeley Mafia|a degree of discipline]] to [[economic policy]] that quickly brought inflation down, stabilized the currency, managed [[foreign debt]], and attracted [[foreign aid]] and [[Foreign investment|investment]].<ref name='SCHWARZ'/>

The late 1980s saw a range of economic reform measures including a managed devaluation of the [[Rupiah]] to improve export competitiveness, and de-regulation of the financial sector. Foreign investment flowed into Indonesia, particularly into a rapidly developing export-orientated [[Secondary sector of industry|manufacturing sector]], and from 1989 to 1997, the Indonesian economy [[Economic growth|grew]] by an average of over 7%.<ref name='SCHWARZ'/><ref name="CountryBrief">{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Indonesia: Country Brief |work=Indonesia:Key Development Data & Statistics |publisher=[[The World Bank]] |date=September 2006 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/INDONESIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20095968~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:226309,00.html |format= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The [[Asian financial crisis|East Asian financial crisis]] of 1997-98, however, hit Indonesia hard. Against the US dollar, the currency dropped from about Rp. 2,000 to Rp. 18,000 and the economy shrunk by a devastating 13.7%, causing much hardship.<ref name="CountryBrief"/> The [[rupiah]] has since stabilized at around Rp. 10,000 and there has been a slow but significant recovery.

===Ethnic groups===
[[Image:Joyce.png|220px|left|thumb|A [[Minangkabau]] woman in traditional dress.]]
Most Indonesians are ethnically [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]], particularly in central and western Indonesia, although much of eastern Indonesia is [[Melanesia]]n. There are, however, around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia and 742 different languages and dialects.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Expat Web Site Association |title=An Overview of Indonesia |work=Living in Indonesia, A Site for Expatriates |url=http://www.expat.or.id/info/overview.html |accessdate=2006-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Merdekawaty |first=E. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title="Bahasa Indonesia" and languages of Indonesia |work=UNIBZ - Introduction to Linguistics |publisher=Free University of Bozen |date=2006-07-06 |url=http://www.languagestudies.unibz.it/Bahasa%20Indonesia_Merdekawaty.pdf |accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref> Small but significant populations of [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]], Indians, Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in [[urban area]]s. An almost universally shared sense of Indonesian nationhood overlays this vast diversity and steadfastly maintained regional identities, providing a largely harmonious society.

Indonesia, however, is not without social tensions with religious and ethnic differences triggering sometimes horrendous violence. The [[transmigration program]] contributed to the spread of people from highly populated Java and [[Madura]] to eastern Indonesia. Ethnic and religious differences between these immigrants and the local peoples have been blamed for numerous difficulties, sometimes culminating in bloody conflicts such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local [[Dayak]] community in [[West Kalimantan]],<ref>{{cite paper |author=T.N.

[[Chinese Indonesian]]s are arguably the most influential [[Minority group|ethnic minority]] in Indonesia. Although the Chinese make up only 2% of the population, the majority of the locally-owned businesses and wealth in the country is Chinese-controlled.

{{main|Languages of Indonesia}}
The official national language, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] (''Bahasa Indonesia''), is universally taught in schools and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian. It is the language of business, politics, national media, education and academia. Yet, in isolated areas &ndash; even on the major islands &ndash; it is not uncommon to find villagers who are not familiar with Indonesian.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Brian |last=Crawford |title=South of the Philippines, East of Kalimantan, West of the Malukus |publisher=Conservation Strategies |url=http://www.reefnet.org/issue6/constrat6.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05}}; {{cite conference |first=Noel B. |last=Salazar |title=An Anthropologist's Report from Yogyakarta, Indonesia |publisher=Penn Museum Research |date=2006-04-06 |url=http://www.museum.upenn.edu/new/research/blogs/earthquake_blog.shtml |accessdate=}}</ref> It was originally a [[lingua franca]] for most of the region, including present-day [[Malaysia]] and is thus closely related to [[Malay language|Malay]]. It was first promoted as a national language in 1928 by the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI), accepted by the Dutch as the ''[[de facto]]'' language for the colony, and then declared the [[official language]] after independence. Most Indonesians speak at least one of the [[Languages of Indonesia|several hundred local languages]] (''bahasa daerah''), often as their [[first language]]. Of these, [[Javanese language|Javanese]] is the most widely-spoken language, as it is the language of the largest ethnic group.<ref name='indoCIA'>Indonesia - [[The World Factbook]] https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/id.html</ref> [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] on the other hand, has as many as five hundred or more indigenous [[Papuan languages|Papuan]] or [[Austronesian languages]] in a region of just 2.7 million people.

Before the arrival of the [[Abrahamic]] faiths of Christianity and Islam, the popular [[Religion|belief systems]] in the region were thoroughly influenced by [[Dharmic]] [[Philosophy of religion|religious philosophy]] through Hinduism and Buddhism. The influence of Hinduism and classical [[India]] remain defining traits of [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian culture]]; the Indian concept of the [[god-king]] still shapes Indonesian concepts of leadership and the use of [[Sanskrit]] in courtly literature and adaptations of Indian mythology such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] was first brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries, and the [[Protestant]] denominations are largely a result of Dutch [[Calvinist]] and [[Lutheran]] missionary efforts during its colonial time. Missionary efforts did not extend to Java or other predominantly Muslim areas. As with Islam and Hinduism, Christian beliefs in Indonesia are sometimes [[Syncretism|combined]] with [[animism]] and other traditional beliefs and cultural practices.

==Culture and art forms==
{{main|Culture of Indonesia}}
[[Image:WayangKulit Scene Zoom.JPG|thumb|220px|A [[Wayang|Wayang kulit]] shadow puppet performance as seen by the audience.]]
Indonesia has around three hundred ethnic groups, each with [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] that have shifted over the centuries. Modern-day Indonesian culture is a fusion of this diversity. Indonesia has also imported cultural aspects from [[Arab]]ic, Chinese, Malay and [[European]] sources.

Traditional [[Javanese]] and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] dances, for example, contain aspects of [[Hindu]] culture and mythology as does the Javanese and Balinese ''[[Wayang|wayang kulit]]'' ("shadow puppet") shows, depicting mythological events. Cloth such as [[batik]], [[ikat]] and [[songket]] are created across Indonesia with different areas having different styles and specializations. The most dominant influences on [[Indonesian architecture]] have traditionally been [[Indian architecture|Indian]], however, Chinese, Arab, and, particularly from the nineteenth century, European architecture has had a significant influence. ''[[Pencak Silat]]'' is a unique martial art originating from the archipelago.

Derived from centuries of exchange with Chinese, European, [[Middle East]]ern and Indian influences, Indonesia has developed its [[Cuisine of Indonesia|own distinctive cuisine]], which varies across its regions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Witton |first=Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=World Food: Indonesia |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |date=2002 |location=Melbourne |pages= |url= |doi= |id=ISBN 1-74059-009-0}}</ref> Rice is the [[staple food]] of most Indonesian dishes and is served with several [[side dish]]es of meat and/or vegetables.

[[Music of Indonesia|Indonesian music]] varies within cities and groups as people who live in the countryside would listen to a different kind of music than people in the city. Although [[Rock music|rock]] was introduced to Indonesia by the Indonesian [[rock band]] God Bless (see [[Ian Antono]]),<ref>{{id icon}} {{cite web |title=''Ian Antono: Pelopor Gitar Hero Indonesia'' |last=Diaz (editor) |first= |url=http://www.gitaris.com/IanAntono.p |work=Biography of Ian Antono |publisher=Gitaris.com |date=2005}}</ref> native Indonesian music is still preserved. Examples of Indonesian [[Folk music|traditional music]] are ''[[Gamelan]]'' and ''Keroncong''. ''[[Dangdut]]'' is a hugely popular contemporary genre of [[pop music]] partly derived from Arabic, Indian, and Malay folk music.

<!-- IMPORTANT NOTICE BEFORE YOU ADD ANOTHER INFOBOX:
------------------------------------------------------
We like infoboxes, really, but they serve as additional information, that categorization is not enough. For example, to state who precede whom (timeline), to put compact facts, etc. We have already too many country-related infoboxes, that we think it is too many. If you want to add your infobox, then please consider whether putting this article as a category would suffice your grouping. Otherwise we have to decline your request. 

Thank you.
