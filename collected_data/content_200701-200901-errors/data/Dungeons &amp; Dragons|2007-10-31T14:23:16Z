'''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''D&D''''' or '''''DnD''''') is a tabletop [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]] (RPG) originally designed by [[Gary Gygax|E. Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]], and first published in 1974 by the Gygax-owned company [[TSR, Inc.|Tactical Studies Rules, Inc.]] (TSR). The game is currently published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], a division of [[Hasbro]]. It was derived from [[Miniature wargaming|miniature wargames]], with a variation of the ''[[chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' game serving as the initial rule system.<ref name="Banshee_Gygax" /> ''D&D'''s publication is widely regarded as the beginning of modern role-playing games and, by extension, the entire role-playing game industry.<ref name="culture">{{cite book

Players of ''D&D'' create [[Player character|characters]] that embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy [[setting (literature)|setting]]. A [[Dungeon Master]] (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while also maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur. During each game session, the players listen to descriptions of their character's surroundings, as well as additional information and potential choices from the DM, then describe their actions in response. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting's inhabitants (and each other), solves dilemmas, engages in battles and gathers treasure and knowledge.<ref name="culture" /> In the process the characters earn [[experience points]] to become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions. ''D&D'' departs from traditional wargaming and assigns each player a specific [[fictional character|character]] to play instead of a [[military formation]]. Miniature figures or markers, placed on a grid, are sometimes used to represent these characters.

The early success of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' led to a proliferation of similar game systems, such as ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'',<ref name="hist2" /> ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]'' and ''[[RuneQuest]]''.<ref name="hist_schick">(Schick 1991:17–34)</ref> Despite this competition, ''D&D'' dominates the role-playing game industry, enjoying a nearly unassailable market position.<ref>[[Monte Cook]], former D&D designer and an independent publisher, describes the extent of D&D's lead in these extreme terms: “Frankly, the difference in sales between Wizards and all other producers of roleplaying games is so staggering that even saying there is an ‘RPG industry’ at all may be generous.”

==Play overview==
[[Image:Dungeons and Dragons game.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A D&D game session in progress]]
''Dungeons & Dragons'' is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a table-top. Typically, each player controls only a single character.<ref>Sometimes if not enough players, each may control more than one character. The ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game|Basic Game]]'' suggests, “If there are characters left over, some players may play more than one (but they don't have to)”. (Tweet 2004) Read This First sheet.</ref> As a group, these [[player characters]] (PCs) are often described as a ‘party’ of adventurers, with each often having his or her own areas of specialized talents.<ref>(Slavicsek & Baker 2005:268) Chapter 21:Roleplaying and Working Together</ref> During the course of play, each player directs the actions of his or her character and its interactions with the other characters in the game.<ref>(Tweet 2003:5)</ref><ref name="waskul">{{cite book

===Game mechanics===
{{main|Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)}}

[[Image:DnD Dice Set.jpg|thumb|250px|left|D&D uses [[Polyhedron|polyhedral]] dice to resolve random events. From left, 4-, 6-, 8-, 12-, 20- and two 10-sided dice.]]

Before the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] his or her player character (PC) and records the details (described below) on a [[character sheet]]. First, a player rolls dice to determine his or her character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#ability scores|ability scores]],<ref>While the original game used 3d6 (Gygax & Arneson 1974) and this continued as the standard version with some version, though variants have been included (Gygax 1979:11), the standard for 3rd edition is “rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three” (Tweet 2000:4).</ref> which consist of strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.<ref>Given is the current standard order for ability scores. Before 2nd edition AD&D they were always ordered strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma.</ref> The player then chooses a [[Race (fantasy)|race]] (species), a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (occupation), an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook) and a number of skills and feats to enhance the character's basic abilities.<ref>(Tweet 2000:4) Character Creation Basics</ref> Additional [[back-story|background history]], not covered by specific rules, is often also used to further develop the character.<ref>(Gygax 1978:34) Establishing the Character</ref>

During the game, players describe their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM [[in character]]—who then describes the result or response.<ref>(Tweet 2004:24) Exploring</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice.<ref name="waskul" /> Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the difficulty of the task.<ref>(Tweet 2003:62) Using Skills</ref> In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or a magical effect is triggered, a [[saving throw]] can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided.<ref>“Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect.” There is identical language in sections titled ‘Saving Throws’ in (Tweet 2003:136) and (Tweet 2000:119).</ref> In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and (with the 3rd edition) ability scores.<ref>Sections entitled ‘Saving Throws’ in (Tweet 2003:136) and (Tweet 2000:119–120).</ref>

As the game is played, each PC grows and changes over time as they gain experience. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills<ref>(Cook 2003:197) How PCs Improve</ref> and wealth, and may even change alignment<ref>Early editions did not allow or had severe penalties for changing alignment (Gygax 1979a:24) but more recent versions are more allowing of change. (Cook 2003:134)</ref> or add additional character classes.<ref>(Tweet 2003:59) Multiclass Characters</ref> One key way characters progress is by earning [[experience points]] (XP/EXP) when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task.<ref>(Gygax 1979:84) Experience</ref> Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level]], which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills.<ref>(Tweet 2003:58) Experience and Levels</ref> XP can also be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that require payment of an XP cost.<ref>(Cook 2003:46) Experience Penalties</ref>

[[Hit point]]s (HP) are a measure of a character's vitality and health and are determined by the class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>(Tweet 2003:145) Injury and Death</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores<ref>(Cook 2003:289) Ability Score Loss</ref> or character levels.<ref>(Cook 2003:296) Level Loss</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.<ref>(Cook 2003:41) Character Death</ref>

===Adventures and campaigns===

{{main|Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons) }}

A typical ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game consists of an 'adventure', which is roughly equivalent to a single story.<ref>(Cook 2003:43) Chapter Three: Adventures</ref> The DM can either design an adventure on his or her own, or use one of the [[List of Dungeons & Dragons adventures|pre-made adventures]] (previously known as [[List of Dungeons & Dragons modules|modules]]) that have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some also include location descriptions and handouts.

A linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a '[[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]'.<ref>“A D&D campaign is an organized framework … to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.” (Schend et al. 1991:256)</ref> The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are also sometimes called 'campaigns' but are more correctly referred to as 'worlds' or '[[campaign setting]]s'.<ref>“It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably … A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting.” (Cook 2003:129)</ref> ''D&D'' settings are based in various [[fantasy subgenres]] and feature varying levels of magic and technology.<ref>(Williams 1995:45) Properties of Worlds</ref> Popular commercially published [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for ''Dungeons & Dragons'']] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]], [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]] and [[Eberron]].<ref>Greyhawk, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Mystara, Spelljammer, Ravenloft, Dark Sun and Planescape are the campaign settings given their own chapter in Johnson et al. (2004). Eberron was only released in 2004 and, as of 2007, is one of two campaign settings, the other being Forgotten Realms, still actively supported with new releases by Wizards of the Coast.</ref> Alternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.

=== Miniature figures ===

[[Image:Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures 2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Several ''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figures]] <!-- Photograph is under a free license. Figures pictured are FAIR USE as they specifically illustrate the topic under question: D&D miniatures intended for use with D&D -->

The wargames from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figure]]s to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''Chainmail'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>(Johnson et al. 2004:23)</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first Dungeon Masters Guide gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures (Gygax 1979:10) Use of Miniature Figures with the Game.</ref>

In the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. In 1977, the British manufacturer [[Minifigs|Miniature Figurines Limited]] became the first company to partner with [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] and release miniatures under the official Dungeons and Dragons label.<ref>{{cite web

=== Sources and influences ===
{{main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons & Dragons}}

The immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as [[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]. [[Dave Arneson]] used Chainmail to run games where players controlled a single character instead of an army, an innovation that inspired ''D&D''.<ref name="Banshee_Gygax">{{cite web

=== Edition history ===
{{main|Editions of Dungeons & Dragons}}
''Dungeons & Dragons'' has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.
[[Image:D&d Box1st.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The original ''Dungeons & Dragons'' set]]
<!-- FAIR USE of D&d_Box1st.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:D&d_Box1st.jpg for rationale -->
The original ''Dungeons and Dragons'' (now referred to as OD&D) was a small box set of three booklets published in 1974.<ref>(Gygax & Arneson 1974)</ref> Amateurish in production and written from a perspective which assumed the reader had familiarity with wargaming, it nevertheless exploded in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of [[college]] and [[high school]] students. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions (such as the original [[Greyhawk#Publications|Greyhawk]] and [[Blackmoor]] modules, both 1975<ref>(Schick 1991:132–153)</ref>) and magazine articles, both in TSR’s official publications and countless [[fanzine]]s.

In 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide the D&D game for over two decades. A ''Basic Dungeons & Dragons'' boxed set was introduced<ref name="tsr_history" /> to clean up the presentation of the essential rules, make the system understandable to people who had never played wargames before, and put it all in a package allowing the game to be stocked on common retail shelves. In 1978 ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (AD&D) was published,<ref name="tsr_history" /> an attempt to bring together all the rules, options and corrections spread across the various D&D publications and expand them into a single unified and definitive game. The original plan was that the ‘basic’ game would be targeted to toy stores and the general public, while the ‘advanced’ game would be marketed to existing hobbyist gamers. Players who exhausted the possibilities of the basic game were directed in that set to switch to the advanced game. However, this plan went awry nearly from inception, as the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in the advanced game. The cause of this seems to have been a difference of design philosophy; Gygax, who wrote the advanced game, wanted an expansive game with rulings on any conceivable situation which might come up during play, a document which could be used to arbitrate disputes at tournaments. J. Eric Holmes, the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. Confusing matters further, the original crude D&D boxed set continued to be printed and sold well into 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR. Thus three different versions of the game were being published concurrently.<ref name="hist_schick" />

In 1981 ''Basic Dungeons & Dragons'' was revised by Tom Moldvay. However, for reasons that are debated to this day, the game was not brought in line with AD&D but instead was made even more different. Thus the Dungeons & Dragons game (sometimes called ''Basic D&D'' to distinguish it from ''AD&D'', though TSR never referred to the entire system as such) became a separate and distinct product from TSR’s flagship game AD&D. Discrete sets of increasing power levels were introduced as expansions for the basic game.<ref>{{cite journal

</ref>This game was promoted as a continuation of the tone of original D&D whereas AD&D was an advancement of the mechanics.<ref name="dragon26" /> Although simpler overall than the ‘Advanced’ game, it included rules for some situations not covered in ''AD&D''. There were five sets: ''Basic'' (1977, revised in 1981 and again in 1983),<ref>(Gygax & Arneson 1977, 1981a & 1983a)</ref> ''Expert'' (1981, revised in 1983),<ref>(Gygax & Arneson 1981b & 1983b)</ref> ''Companion'' (1983),<ref>(Mentzer 1985)</ref> ''Master'' (1985),<ref>(Gygax & Mentzer 1985)</ref> and ''Immortals'' (1986, 1991)<ref>(Mentzer 1986) & (Allston 1992)</ref> each covering game play for higher character experience levels than the previous. The first four sets were later compiled as a single hardcover book, the ''Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia'' (1991).<ref>(Schend et al. 1991)</ref>

'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''''' (or ''AD&D'') was a more complex version of the game. It was designed to create a tighter more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name="dragon26">{{cite journal

</ref> While seen by many as a revision of D&D,<ref name="WTNI" /> AD&D was at time declared to be “neither an expansion nor a revision of the old game, it is a new game”.<ref name="dragon26" /> The ''AD&D'' game was not intended to be directly compatible with ''D&D'' and requires some conversion to play between the rule sets.<ref>(Schend et al. 1991:291) Appendix 2: AD&D Game Conversions</ref> The term ''Advanced'' describes the more complex rules and does not imply “for higher-level gaming abilities”. Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the ‘core rulebooks’, were released: The ''[[Player's Handbook|Player’s Handbook]]'' (PHB),<ref>(Gygax 1978)</ref> the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide|Dungeon Master’s Guide]]'' (DMG),<ref>(Gygax 1979a)</ref> and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM).<ref>(Gygax 1977)</ref> Several additional books published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985),<ref>(Gygax 1985)</ref> included a large number of new rules.<ref name="tsr_history" />

'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition''''' (sometimes referred to as ''AD&D2'' or ''2nd Ed'') was published in 1989,<ref name="tsr_history" /> once again as three core rulebooks. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder which was later replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. The release of ''AD&D2'' also corresponded with an effort to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity. This edition removed references to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types (such as assassins and half-orcs).<ref name="Dragon 154" /> The edition moved from an underlying basis of 1960's and 1970's "sword and sorcery" fantasy fiction to that of a more medieval historical and mythological view.<ref>(Cook 1989b:25-41)</ref> Aside from these revisions the rules underwent a number of minor changes including for the addition of non-weapon proficiencies (which are skill-like abilities that originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements) and the division of magic spells into schools and spheres.<ref>   {{cite web

'''''Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition''''' (also referred to as ''D&D3'' or ''3E'' and not to be confused with the 1983 edition of the basic ''D&D'' game) was released in 2000 following three years of development which began when a near-bankrupt TSR was bought by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1997.<ref>Adkison, Peter ''Third Edition'' chapter in Johnson et al.

Over the years, many gamers have criticized various aspects of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' rules. Within months of ''Dungeons & Dragons''’s release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by D&D include ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'' (1975),<ref name="hist2">(Schick 1978:223–224)</ref> ''[[Tékumel|Empire of the Petal Throne]]'' (1975) and ''[[Chivalry and Sorcery]]'' (1976).<ref>{{cite book

Early in the game’s history, TSR took no action against small publishers producing ''D&D'' compatible material. This attitude changed in the mid 1980s when TSR revoked these rights (even from publishers they had earlier officially licensed, such as [[Judges Guild]]),<ref>{{cite journal

</ref> and took legal action to prevent others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies.<ref name="hist_schick" /> TSR itself also ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.<ref>Copyright conflicts with the [[Tolkien Estate]] lead to removal of references to [[Hobbit]]s, [[Ent]]s and others. {{cite book

After publishing the 3rd Edition, the then-license holders reversed the stance on 3rd party material with the introduction of the [[Open Gaming License]], which allows compatible material (though technically not ''Dungeons & Dragons'' material) to be produced.<ref>{{cite web

As the popularity of ''D&D'' grew throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, the game was referenced more and more in popular culture. Numerous games, films and cultural references based on ''D&D'' or ''D&D''-like fantasies, characters or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the 1970s. Typically, though by no means exclusively, ''D&D'' players are portrayed derogatively as the epitome of [[geek]]dom.<ref>{{cite news
