The '''lion''' (''Panthera leo'') is a member of the family [[Felidae]] and one of four "[[big cat]]s" in the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]''. Reaching up to 225&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (500&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]), it is the second-largest cat after the [[tiger]]. Although lions were once widespread throughout much of Africa, Asia, Europe, and even prehistoric North and South America, they currently exist in the wild only in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], with a [[critically endangered]] remnant population in northwest [[India]].  

In the wild, lions live for approximately 10&ndash;14&nbsp;years, while in captivity they can live over 20&nbsp;years. They typically inhabit [[savanna]] and [[grassland]], although they may take to bush and [[forest]]. Lions are unusually [[social animal|social]] compared to other cats. A lion ''pride'' consists of related females and offspring and a small number of dominant males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large [[ungulate]]s. The lion is an [[apex predator|apex]] and [[keystone predator]].   

The lion is a [[vulnerable species]], having seen a possibly irreversible population decline of 30 to 50% in its African range. Although the cause of the decline is not well-understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern.

The male lion is highly distinctive and can be instantly recognized by its [[mane]]. The lion, particularly the face of the male, is one of the most widely recognized animal symbols in human [[culture]]. It has been extensively depicted in literature, in [[sculpture]]s, in [[painting]]s, on national [[flag]]s, and in films.

==Naming and etymology==
The lion's name, similar in many languages, derives from the [[Latin]] ''leo'',<ref>{{cite book  | last = Simpson  | first = D.P.  | title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.  | date = 1979   | edition = 5 | location = London  | pages = 883  | id = ISBN 0-304-52257-0}}</ref> and before that the [[Ancient Greek]] ''leōn''/λεων.<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | id = ISBN 0-19-910207-4}}</ref> The [[Hebrew]] word ''lavi'' (לָבִיא) may also be related,<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| title=Lion|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Simpson, J., Weiner, E.

As in other ancient scripts, in Ancient Egyptian only the consonants are written. No distinction was made between 'l' and 'r'.</ref> It was one of the many species originally described, as ''Felis leo'', by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th&nbsp;century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book  | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus  | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The generic component of its scientific designation, ''Panthera leo'', is often presumed to derive from Greek ''pan-'' ("all") and ''ther'' ("beast"), but this may be a [[folk etymology]]. Although it came into English through the classical languages, ''panthera'' is probably of East Asian origin, meaning "the yellowish animal," or "whitish-yellow".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=panther | title = "Panther" | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher = [[Douglas Harper]] | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref>

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:Lion Ngorongoro Crater.jpg|thumb|left|Male lion in the [[Ngorongoro Crater]], [[Tanzania]]]]  
The lion is a large and muscular feline with a compact build. It is considerably larger than nearly all other cat species; only the [[tiger]] is larger. With short, powerful legs, a strong [[jaw]], and long canine [[teeth]], the lion can bring down and kill large prey.<ref name=Honolulu>{{cite web |url=http://www.honoluluzoo.org/lion.htm |title=Lion |accessdate=2007-07-12 |publisher=Honolulu Zoo}}</ref> Lion coloration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. The color of the mane varies from blond to black. 

Average listed weights for the male lion are between 150&ndash;225&nbsp;kg (330&ndash;500&nbsp;lb), and 120&ndash;150&nbsp;kg (260&ndash;330&nbsp;lb) for females.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/14.shtml|title=BBC Wildfacts – Lion}}</ref> Nowell and Jackson report average weights of 181&nbsp;kg for males and 126&nbsp;kg for females.<ref name=CAP> Nowell, K. and Jackson, P.

The tail length is 70&ndash;100&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in&ndash;3&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in).<ref>Ronald M. Nowak: ''Walker's Mammals of the World''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999 ISBN 0-8018-5789-9</ref> The tail ends in a hairy tuft. The tuft conceals a spine, approximately 5&nbsp;mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tuffed tail and the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. 

====Mane====
[[Image:HansomeLion 002.jpg|thumb|right|During confrontations with others, the mane makes the lion look bigger than he really is.]][[Image:Maneless lion from Tsavo East National Park.png|thumb|right|A maneless male lion from Tsavo East National Park, Kenya]]The mane of the male lion, unique amongst cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. The presence, absence, color, and size of the mane is associated with sexual maturity, climate and [[testosterone]] production. The mane makes the lion look bigger than he really is, providing an excellent intimidation display; this aids him during confrontations with other lions and with the species' chief competitor, the [[spotted hyena]].<ref>
{{cite web | last = Trivedi | first = BP | title = Are Maneless Tsavo Lions Prone to Male Pattern Baldness? | publisher = National Geographic | date = 2005 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/04/0412_020412_TVtsavolions.html | accessdate = 2007-07-07}}</ref>  Research in Tanzania suggests mane darkness correlates to nutrition and testosterone, and that mane length signals fighting success in male-male relationships.

Maneless lions have been reported in [[Senegal]] and [[Tsavo East National Park]] in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati was also maneless. [[castration|Castrated]] lions have minimal manes. Manelessness is also found in inbred lion populations; inbreeding also results in poor fertility.<ref>Trivedi, Bijal P., "[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0612_020612_TVlion.html To Boost Gene Pool, Lions Artificially Inseminated]" in ''[[National Geographic]] News'', 12 June 2002. Retrieved 17 July 2007.</ref>

Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by  [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the [[Barbary lion]] and [[Cape Lion]]. Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the color and size of a lion's mane, such as the [[ambient temperature]].<ref name=West/> The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American [[zoo]]s, for example, can result in a heavy mane. Thus the mane is an inappropriate marker for identifying subspecies.<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity">Barnett, R., N. Yamaguchi, I. Barnes & A. Cooper. 2006.

===White lions===
[[Image:White Lion.jpg|thumb|left|[[White lion]]s owe their coloring to a recessive gene. They are rare forms of the the subspecies ''Panthera leo krugeri''.]]
The [[white lion]] is is not a separate subspecies. Like [[black panther]]s or [[white tiger]]s they are just a special [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] with a genetic condition that causes paler colouration. White lions are occasionally encountered in and around the Kruger National Park, but more commonly found in [[captive animal|captivity]], where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream color of their coats is due to a [[recessive gene]].

==Biology and behaviour==
Lions spend much of their time resting. They are inactive for about 20&nbsp;hours per day.<ref name="Schaller122">Schaller, p. 122</ref> Although lions can be active at any time of day, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming and defecating, followed by intermittent  bursts through the night hours to dawn. Hunting takes place more often during the night hours. They spend an average 2&nbsp;hours a day walking and 50&nbsp;minutes eating.<ref name="Schaller120">Schaller, p. 120-1</ref>

===Hunting and diet===
[[Image:Male Lion and Cub Chitwa South Africa Luca Galuzzi 2004.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Lion and cub eating a [[Cape Buffalo]]]]
Female lions hunt in groups; [[prey]] consists mainly of large mammals, with a preference for [[wildebeest]]s, [[impala]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[African buffalo|buffalo]]s, [[giraffe]]s, and [[warthog]]s. Lions are able to take healthy, adult animals, with the exception of buffalo bulls in their prime and fully grown male giraffes.<ref name="home">{{citeweb|url=http://home.intekom.com/ecotravel/Guides/Wildlife/Vertebrates/Mammals/Big_5/Lion/african-lion-hunting-habits.htm
|title=African Lion Hunting Habits in South Africa and Southern Africa|accessmonthday=31 July|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Many other species are hunted based on availability, mainly ungulates of a weight between 50 and 300 kg, like [[kudu]], [[hartebeest]], [[gemsbok]] and [[eland]] in Africa or [[nilgai]], [[wild boar]]s and several deer species in India. Occasionally, they take relatively small species like [[Thomson's gazelle]]s or [[Springbok Antelope|springbok]]s. Very large species such as the [[hippopotamus]], the [[rhinoceros]] and the [[elephant]] are generally avoided due to the danger of injury and the effort required to capture them.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hayward, Matt W. and Kerley, Graham|title=Prey preferences of the lion (''Panthera leo'')|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=267|issue=3|year=2005|pages=309-322|doi=10.1017/S0952836905007508}}</ref> In some areas, lions specialise in hunting atypical prey-species; this is the case at the [[Chobe National Park#Geography and ecosystems|Savuti]] river, where they prey on young [[elephant]]s.<ref>Kemp, Leigh, "[http://www.go2africa.com/botswana/chobe/savuti/legendary-elephant-eaters.asp The Elephant Eaters of the Savuti]."

[[Image:Female Lion.JPG|thumb|right|While a lion's teeth are sharp, prey is usually killed by strangulation.]]
[[Image:Lion pair2.jpg|thumb|right|During a mating bout, a couple may copulate twenty to forty times a day for several days.]]

Young lions first display stalking behaviour around attempt three months of age, though do not participate in actual hunting until almost a year old. They begin to hunt effectively when they are almost two years old.<ref name = "Schaller153">Schaller, p. 153</ref>
Lions can reach speeds of 50&nbsp;mph,<ref name = "Schaller233">Schaller, p. 233</ref> though only for short bursts,<ref name = "Schaller2478">Schaller, p. 247-8</ref>  so they have to be quite nearby their prey before starting the attack. Lions take advantage of factors which reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.<ref name = "Schaller237">Schaller, p. 237</ref> They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of about 30&nbsp;[[metre|m]] (98 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]) or less. Usually several lions work together and encircle the herd from different points. The attack is short and powerful, the lion attempting to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey is usually killed by strangulation.<ref>{{cite web |title=About lions - Ecology and behaviour |author=Dr Gus Mills |publisher=African Lion Working Group |url=http://www.african-lion.org/lions_e.htm |accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref>

Because lions hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their prey more easily against other large predators like hyenas, which can be attracted by [[vulture]]s over kilometers in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting; males attached to prides do not usually participate, except in the case of large animals such as buffalo. In group hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stander, P. E.|title=Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=29|issue=6|year=1992|doi=10.1007/BF00170175|pages=445—454}}</ref>

===Reproduction===
Lions do not [[mating|mate]] at any specific time of year, and the females are [[Estrous cycle#Frequency|polyestrous]].<ref name ="Schaller174">Schaller, p. 174</ref> Like other cats, the male lion's penis has spines which point backwards. Upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} A female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat; during a mating bout, which could last several days, the couple frequently copulate twenty to forty times a day and are likely to forgo hunting. In captivity, lions reproduce very well.

The average gestation period is around 110&nbsp;days,<ref name ="Schaller174"/> the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs. Lionesses in a pride will synchronize their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young, who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. Cubs are usually born and initially kept hidden from view in thickets or sheltered areas. They weigh 1.2-21&nbsp;kg at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.<ref name ="Schaller143">Schaller, p. 143</ref> Weaning occurs after six to seven months. In the wild, competition for food is fierce, and as many as 80% of the cubs will die before the age of two.<ref>{{cite book |last=Macdonald |first=David |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York |pages=31|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>

When one or more new males take over a pride and oust the previous master(s), the conquerors often kill any remaining cubs.<ref name="Packpus83">{{cite journal |author=Packer, C., Pusey, A. E. |year=1983 |month=May |title= Adaptations of female lions to infanticide by incoming males|journal= American Naturalist|volume=121 |issue=5|pages=716-728|url=http://www.lionresearch.org/current_docs/6.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> This is explained by the fact that the females would not become fertile and receptive until the cubs grow up or die. The male lions reach maturity at about 3&nbsp;years of age and are capable of taking over another pride at 4–5&nbsp;years old. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15&nbsp;years of age at the latest.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crandall |first=L |title=The management of wild animals in captivity |year=1964 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn= }}</ref> This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature—the fathers have to procreate as soon as they take over the pride. The lioness will often attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful, as he usually kills all the previous top male's cubs that are less than two years old and the female is much lighter and has less strength than the male. However, success is more likely when a group of 3 or 4 mothers within the pride join forces against one male.<ref name="Packpus83"/>

One scientific study reports that both males and females may interact [[animal sexuality|homosexually]].<ref>Bruce Bagemihl, ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity,'' St. Martin's Press, 1999; pp.302-305. In his discussion of lion same-sex relations, Bagemihl is making use of published work by: J.B. Cooper, "An Exploratory Study on African Lions" in ''Comparative Psychology Monographs'' 17:1-48; R.L. Eaton, "The Biology and Social Behavior of Reproduction in the Lion" in Eaton, ed. ''The World's Cats,'' vol. II; pp.3-58; Seattle, 1974; G.B. Schaller, ''The Serengeti Lion''; University of Chicago Press, 1972</ref><ref>Suvira Srivastav, [http://www.teri.res.in/teriin/terragreen/issue3/feature.htm ''Lion, Without Lioness'' in TerraGreen website]</ref> Male lions pair-bond for a number of days and initiate homosexual activity with affectionate nuzzling and caressing, leading to mounting and thrusting. A study found that about 8% of mountings have been observed to occur with other males, while female pairings are held to be fairly common in captivity but have not been observed in the wild.

===Group organization===
[[Image:Lion cub with mother.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Head rubbing and licking are common social behaviors within a pride.]]
[[Image:Natgeo-lion2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lions drinking in the [[Jubba River]], [[Somalia]]]]

Lions are predatory [[carnivore]]s who manifest two types of social organization. Some are ''residents,'' living in groups, called ''prides''.<ref name ="Schaller33">Schaller, p. 33</ref> The pride consists of (usually around five or six) related females, their cubs of both sexes, and a group of one to four males known as a ''coalition'' who mate with the adult females. Others are ''nomads'', ranging widely and moving sporadically, either singularly or in pairs.<ref name ="Schaller33"/> Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. The area a pride occupies is called a ''pride area'', whereas that by a nomad is a ''range''.<ref name ="Schaller33"/>

Being smaller and more agile than males, and lacking the conspicuous mane, lionesses do the pride's hunting, while the stronger males patrol the territory and protect the pride. There is no clear hierarchy with food: male lions often eat animals killed by lionesses but will never share food they have killed themselves; they will take food from cubs but are more likely to share with cubs than lionesses, which are more likely to share with each other. There is more sharing with larger kills.<ref name ="Schaller133">Schaller, p. 133</ref>

Why [[Social behavior|sociality]]—the most pronounced in any cat species—has developed in lions is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation, but also ensures that non-hunting "cheaters" reduce per capita caloric intake. Other benefits include possible [[kin selection]] (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.<ref name=CAP/> 

Both males and females defend the pride against intruders. Some individual lions consistently lead the defense against intruders, while others lag behind.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heinsohn, R. and Packer, C. |year=1995 |month= |title=Complex cooperative strategies in group-territorial African lions |journal=Science  |volume= |issue=269 |pages=1260-1262}}</ref> These “laggards” are not punished by leaders. Possibly laggards provide other services to the group so that leaders forgive them.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morell, V. |year=1995 |title=Cowardly lions confound cooperation theory |journal=Science |volume= |issue=269 |pages=1216-1217}}</ref> An alternative hypothesis is that there is some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jahn, G. C. |year=1996 |title= Lioness Leadership|journal=Science |volume= |issue=271 |pages=1215}}</ref>

The leading male or males often have to defend against outside males attempting to take over the pride. Females form a social unit in a pride and will not tolerate outside females.<ref name ="Schaller37">Schaller, p. 37</ref> Subadult males leave the pride when they reach maturity at around 2-3 years of age; some females become nomadic as well.<ref name ="Schaller44">Schaller, p. 44</ref>

===Communication===
When resting, lions seem to enjoy fellowship by a number of social behaviors; expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,<ref name ="Schaller85">Schaller, p. 85</ref> which have been compared with grooming in primates.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Morris, Desmond|last=Sparks |first=J |title=Primate Ethology |chapter=Allogrooming in primates:a review |year=1967 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |isbn=0297748289}}</ref> Consisting of nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion, head rubbing appears to be a form of greeting;<ref>{{de icon}}{{cite book |last=Leyhausen |first=P |title=Verhaltensstudien an Katzen|edition= 2nd |year=1960 |publisher=Paul Parey |location=Berlin |isbn=3489718364 }}</ref> it is seen often after a lion has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation.

Sounds emitted can include snarling, purring, hissing, coughing, miaowing, woofing and roaring. Lions most often roar at night; the sound, which can be heard from a distance 8 km, is used to advertise the animal's presence. <ref name ="Schaller10313">Schaller, p. 103-13</ref>

==Population and distribution==

[[Image:Map Guj Nat Parks Sanctuary.png|thumb|left|The Gir Forest in the State of Gujarat, India is the last natural habitat of the 300-odd wild [[Asiatic Lion]]s. Plans are afoot to re-introduce some to [[Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in the neighboring State of [[Madhya Pradesh]] in India.]]

In relatively recent times the habitat of lions spanned the southern parts of [[Eurasia]], ranging from [[Greece]] to [[India]], and most of [[Africa]] except the central [[rainforest]]-zone and the [[Sahara]] desert. The last lions in [[Europe]] died out in historic times. A population of the [[Asiatic lion]] survived until the 10th century in the [[Caucasus]], their last European outpost.<ref>* V. G. Heptner and A. A. Sludskii: ''Mammals of the Sowjetunion Vol. II, Part 2 CARNIVORA (Hyaenas and Cats)''. Leiden, New York, 1989 ISBN 900408876 8</ref> Between the late 19th and early 20th century they also became extinct in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. Now, most lions live in eastern and southern Africa, and their numbers are rapidly decreasing, with an estimated 30-50% decline in this range<ref name=IUCN/>. Currently, estimates of the African lion population range between 16,000 and 30,000 living in the wild, down from early 1990s estimates that ranged as high as 100,000; increased contact with human development is cited as the primary cause.<ref>{{cite web |title=NATURE.

The [[Asiatic Lion]] (''Panthera leo persica''), whose habitat ranged from [[Turkey]] to India and from the Caucasus to [[Yemen]] in historical times, was eradicated from [[Palestine]] by the [[Middle Ages]] and from most of the rest of Asia after the arrival of readily available firearms in the 18th century. By the late 19th century the lion had disappeared from [[Turkey]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Ustay, A.H.|year=1990|title= Hunting in Turkey|publisher=BBA, Istanbul}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Past and present distribution of the lion in North Africa and Southwest Asia. |date=2001 |publisher=Asiatic Lion Information Centre |url=http://www.asiatic-lion.org/distrib.html |accessdate=2006-06-01 }}</ref> while the last sighting of a live Asiatic Lion in [[Iran]] was in 1941 (between [[Shiraz]] and Jahrom, [[Fars]] province).

About 300 lions live in a 1412 km² (558 [[square mile]]s) sanctuary in the state of [[Gujarat]], which covers most of the forest. Their numbers remain stable.

Until the late [[Pleistocene]] (about 10,000 years ago), lions were also found in the [[Americas]] and in northern Eurasia. The most famous of these prehistoric subspecies were the [[Cave Lion]] (''Panthera leo spelaea'') and the [[American Lion]] (''Panthera leo atrox'') (not to be confused with the [[Cougar]], ''Puma concolor'', also known as the Mountain Lion).

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[Image:Panthera leo Kruger Skull.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of a modern lion at Kruger National Park]]
The oldest [[fossil]] record of a cat closely resembling a lion is known from [[Laetoli]] in [[Tanzania]] and is perhaps 3.5&nbsp;million years old; some scientists have identified the material as ''Panthera leo''. These records are not well-substantiated, and all that can be said is that they pertain to a ''Panthera''-like felid. The oldest confirmed records of ''Panthera leo'' in Africa are about 2&nbsp;million years younger.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Werdelin |first=Lars |coauthors=Lewis, Margaret E. |year=2005 |month=June |title=Plio-Pleistocene Carnivora of eastern Africa: species richness and turnover patterns  |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=144|issue=2 |pages=121-144 |publisher=The Linnean Society of London |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/zoj/2005/00000144/00000002/art00001 |accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>
The closest relatives of the lion are the other ''[[Panthera]]'' species, by name the tiger, the jaguar and the leopard. Morphological and genetic studies reveal, that the tiger was the first of these recent species to diverge. About 1.9&nbsp;million years ago the Jaguar branched off the remaining group, which contained ancestors of the leopard and lion. The Lion and leopard subsequently separated about 1 to 1.25&nbsp;million years ago from each other.<ref>Li Yua and Ya-ping Zhang: ''Phylogenetic studies of pantherine cats (Felidae) based on multiple genes, with novel application of nuclear β-fibrinogen intron 7 to carnivores''.

700,000 years ago, ''Panthera leo'' appeared in Europe for the first time with the subspecies ''[[Panthera leo fossilis]]'' at [[Isernia]] in [[Italy]]. From this lion derived the later [[Cave lion]] (''Panthera leo spelaea''), which appeared about 300,000 years ago. During the upper [[Pleistocene]] the lion spread to North and South America, and developed into ''Panthera leo atrox'', the [[American lion]].<ref>A.

Traditionally 12 recent subspecies of lion were recognized. The major differences between these subspecies are location, mane appearance, size and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were debatable and probably invalid.<ref>* V. G. Heptner and A. A.

Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too much, [[mitochondria]]l variation in recent African lions is modest, what suggests that all sub-Saharan lions could be considered a single subspecies, possibly divided in two main clades: one to the west of the [[Great Rift Valley]] and the other to the east.

====Recent====
Seven recent subspecies are recognized today:
* '''''P. l. persica''''', known as the '''[[Asiatic lion|Asiatic-]]''' or '''South Asian, Persian or Indian lion''' was once widespread from [[Turkey]], across the [[Middle East]], to [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and even [[Bangladesh]]. However large prides and daylight activity made it easier to poach than tigers or leopards; now around 300 currently exist in and near the [[Gir Forest]] of India.
* '''''P. l. leo''''', known as the '''[[Barbary lion]]''', is extinct in the wild, although captive individuals may still exist. This was the largest of the Lion subspecies, which ranged from Morocco to Egypt. The last wild Barbary lion was killed in Morocco in 1922 due to excessive hunting. Barbary Lions were kept by Roman emperors to take part in the gladiator arenas. Roman notables, including [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], [[Pompey]], and [[Julius Caesar]], often ordered the mass slaughter of Barbary lions—up to 400 at a time.<ref>{{cite web | last = Welman | first = N | title = Lions | work = Alexander the Great's Home on the Web | publisher = Thomas William-Powlett | date = 1994 | url = http://www.pothos.org/alexander.asp?paraID=103&keyword_id=6&title=Lions | accessdate = 2007-07-08}}</ref>
* '''''P. l. senegalensis''''', known as the '''West African lion''', is found in Western Africa, from Senegal to Nigeria.
* '''''P. l. azandica''''', known as the '''North East Congo lion''', is found in the  Northeastern parts of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].
* '''''P. l. nubica''''', known as the '''East African-''' or '''Massai lion''', is found in East Africa, from [[Ethiopia]] and Kenya to [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]].
* '''''P. l. bleyenberghi''''', known as the '''Southwest African-''' or '''Katanga lion'''. South western Africa, [[Zimbabwe]], [[Angola]], [[Katanga]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]]).
* '''''P. l. krugeri''''', known as the '''Southeast African-''' or '''Transvaal lion''', is found in the [[Transvaal]] region of South eastern Africa, including [[Kruger National Park]]. 

====Prehistoric====
Besides these subspecies there are also some prehistoric ones. 
<!-- prose form please -->
* '''''P. l. atrox''''', known as the '''[[American lion]]''' or '''North American cave lion''', was abundant in the Americas from [[Alaska]] to [[Peru]] in the Pleistocene Period until about 10,000 years ago. This form as well as the cave lion are sometimes considered to represent separate species, but recent phylogenetic studies lead to suggest, that they are in fact subspecies of the lion (''Panthera leo'').<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny" /> One of the largest lion subspecies to have existed, its body length is estimated to have been 1.6&ndash;2.5&nbsp;m (5&ndash;8&nbsp;ft).<ref name="Quaternary extinctions">{{cite book |author=Martin, P.S. |title=Quaternary Extinctions |year=1984 |publisher= University of Arizona Press|location= Tucson, Arizona|isbn=0-8165-1100-4 }}</ref> 
* '''''P. l. fossilis''''', known as the '''[[Panthera leo fossilis|Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion]]''', flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been recovered from [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. It was larger than today's African lions, with a maximum head and body length of 2.40&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft).{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
* '''''P. l. spelaea''''', known as the  '''[[Cave lion|European cave lion]]''', Eurasian cave lion or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion occurred in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago.<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny" /> It is known from [[Paleolithic]] [[cave paintings]], [[ivory]] carvings, and clay busts,<ref name = "Packer00">{{cite journal | last = Packer

====Dubious====
* '''''P. l. melanochaita''''', known as the  '''[[Cape lion]]''', became extinct in the wild around 1860. Results of [[mitochondrial DNA]] research do not support the status as a distinct subspecies. It seems probable that the Cape lion was only the southernmost population of the extant southern African lion.<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" />
* '''''P. l. sinhaleyus''''', known as the '''[[Sri Lanka lion]]''', appears to have become extinct [[circa|around]] 39,000 years ago. It is only known from two teeth found in deposits at [[Kuruwita]]. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kelum Manamendra-Arachchi, Rohan Pethiyagoda, Rajith Dissanayake, Madhava Meegaskumbura |year=2005 |month= |title=A second extinct big cat from the late Quaternary of Sri Lanka. |journal=The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology.  |volume=|issue=Supplement No. 12  |pages=423–434 |id= |url=http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/rbz/biblio/s12/s12rbz423-434.pdf|publisher=National University of Singapore |accessdate= 2007-07-31}}</ref>
* '''''P. l. europaea''''', known as the '''[[European lion]]'''; Status as subspecies is unconfirmed. (Probably identical with ''Panthera leo persica'' or ''Panthera leo spelea''.) Extinct around 100 due to persecution and over-exploitation. Inhabited the [[Balkans]], the [[Italian Peninsula]], southern [[France]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It was a very popular object of hunting among [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]].
* '''''P. l. youngi''''' or ''Panthera youngi'' , known as the '''[[North-Eastern Pleistocene China cave lion]]''', 350,000 years ago, relationship to the extant lion subspecies is obscure. Represents probably a distinct species.

*'''''P. l. maculatus''''', known as the '''[[Marozi]]''' or '''Spotted lion''', is sometimes believed to be a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly colored individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard/lion [[Panthera hybrid|hybrid]] commonly known as a [[leopon]].<ref name="shuker">{{cite book | last = Shuker | first = Karl P N | authorlink = Karl Shuker | title = Mystery Cats of the World | publisher = Robert Hale | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-7090-3706-6}}</ref>

==Hybrids==
[[Image:bertramliger.jpg|thumb|right|A [[liger]] is the offspring of a male lion and female [[tiger]].]]
{{further|[[Panthera hybrid]], [[liger]] and [[tigon]]}}
Lions have also been known to [[biological reproduction|breed]] with [[tiger]]s (most often the [[Amur Tiger|Amur]] and [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal]] subspecies) to create hybrids called [[liger]]s and [[tigon]]s. They have also been crossed with [[leopards]] to produce [[leopon]]s and [[jaguar]]s to produce [[jaglion]]s. The [[marozi]] is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the [[Congolese spotted lion]] is a complex lion/jaguar/leopard hybrid called a [[lijagulep]]. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in [[China]].

The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female lion is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they grow one the mane will be modest, around 50% again of a pure lion mane.

The less common tigon is a cross between the lioness and the male tiger. Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene, tigons are often relatively small, only weighing up to 150 kilograms (350 lb),{{Fact|date=August 2007}} which is about 20% smaller than lions. Like ligers, they have physical and behavioural traits from both parental species and males are sterile.

==Conservation status==
[[Image:Pride of lions.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Pride of lions on the move, [[Masai Mara]], [[Kenya]]]]

The Lion is considered a [[vulnerable]] species by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]], while the Asiatic subspecies is [[critically endangered]]. The total population of wild lions dragged from perhaps 400,000 in 1950 to an estimated size of 16,500–47,000 in 2002-2004. The cause of the decline is not well-understood, and may not be reversible.<ref name=IUCN/> Currently, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are considered to be the most significant threats to the species.<ref name="awf">{{cite web|title=AWF Wildlife: Lion|url=http://www.awf.org/content/wildlife/detail/lion|publisher=African Wildlife Foundation|retrieved=2007-08-29}}</ref>

The lion population in the region of West Africa is isolated from lion populations of Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. The number of mature individuals in West Africa is estimated by two separate recent surveys at 850&ndash;1,160 (2002/2004). There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from  100 to 400 lions in [[Burkina Faso]]'s [[Arly-Singou]] ecosystem.<ref name=IUCN/>

Conservation of both African and Asian lions has required the setup and maintenance of national parks and game reserves; among the best known are [[Etosha National Park]] in [[Namibia]], [[Serengeti National Park]] in Tanzania and [[Kruger National Park]] in eastern [[South Africa]]. Outside these areas, the issues arising from lions' interaction with cattle and people usually results in the elimination of the former.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

[[Image:Lion cubs Serengeti.jpg|thumb|left|Lion cubs playing in the [[Serengeti]]]]
Lions are vulnerable to the [[Canine distemper]] [[virus]] (CDV), which is spread though domestic dogs and other [[Carnivora|carnivores]]; an outbreak in [[Serengeti National Park]], Tanzania, in 1994 resulted in many lions exhibiting neurological features such as seizures, and succumbing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roelke-Parker, M.E., Munson, L., Packer, C., Kock, R., Cleaveland, S., Carpenter, M., O'Brien, S.J., Pospischii, A.,  Hoffmann-Lehmann, R., Lutz, H., Mwamengele, G.L.M., Mgasa, M.N., Machange, G.A., Summers, B., Appel, M.J.G.   |year=1996 |month=February |title=A canine distemper epidemic in Serengeti lions ''(Panthera leo)'' |journal= Nature|volume=379 |issue= |pages=441-445 |id= |url=http://www.lionresearch.org/current_docs/17.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> 

In India, the last refuge of the Asiatic Lion is the 1,412&nbsp;km² (558&nbsp;[[square mile]]s) [[Gir Forest National Park]] in western [[India]] which had about 359&nbsp;lions (as of April 2006). As in Africa, numerous human habitations are close by with the resultant problems between lions, livestock, locals and wildlife officials.<ref>

The former popularity of the Barbary Lion as a zoo animal has meant that scattered lions in captivity are likely to be descended from Barbary Lion stock. This includes twelve lions at [[Port Lympne Zoo|Port Lympne Wild Animal Park]] in  [[Kent]], [[England]] that are descended from animals owned by the [[King of Morocco]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.totallywild.net/animals.php?animal=Barbary/Atlas%20Lion|title=www.totallywild.net}}</ref> Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in [[Addis Ababa]] zoo, descendants of animals owned by [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Emperor Haile Selassie]]. WildLink International, in collaboration with [[Oxford University]], launched their ambitious International [[Barbary Lion#The Barbary Lion Project|Barbary Lion Project]] with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a National Park in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]].

==Lions and humans==
===Attacks on humans===
While lions usually do not attack humans, some (usually male) lions seem to seek out human prey. Well-publicized cases include the [[Tsavo maneaters]] and the [[Mfuwe]] man-eater. In both cases the hunters who killed the lions wrote books detailing the animals' predatory behavior. The Mfuwe and Tsavo incidents bear similarities: the lions in both incidents were larger than normal, lacked manes, and seemed to suffer from [[tooth decay]]. Some have speculated that they might belong to an unclassified species of lion, or that they may have been sick and could not have easily caught prey.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers. An analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that, while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |coauthors=Ellis J.

The authors note that the relationship is well-attested amongst other pantherines and primates in the paleontological record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |title= |accessdate=2007-07-07 |last=Peterhans |first=Julian C.

[[Image:Tsavo Maneaters Field Museum.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Tsavo maneaters]] on display in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]]]]
The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behavior in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period—a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near [[Selous Game Reserve|Selous National Park]] in [[Rufiji River|Rufiji District]] and in [[Lindi Region|Lindi Province]] near the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Packer |first=C. |coauthors=Ikanda, D.; Kissui, B.; Kushnir, H. |year=2005 |month=August |title=Conservation biology: lion attacks on humans in Tanzania |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7053 |pages=927-928 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16107828&dopt=Citation |accessdate= 2007-07-06 |quote= }}</ref>

Author Robert R. Frump wrote in ''The Man-eaters of Eden'', published in 2006, that Mozambican refugees crossing Kruger National Park at night in [[South Africa]] regularly are attacked and eaten by the lions there. Park officials conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after [[apartheid]] sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. Mozambicans had for nearly a century before the border was sealed regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.<ref>Frump, R. (2006) ''The Man-eaters of Eden'', The Lyons Press. ISBN 1-592288-92-9</ref>

Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, [[crocodile]]s, elephants, hippos and [[snake]]s, and that the numbers could be double that amount. Lions are thought to kill about 70 humans per year at least in Tanzania, Packer and Ikanda note. Packer and Ikanda are among the few [[conservation movement|conservationists]] who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.

A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. It is believed to have killed and eaten at least 35&nbsp;people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the Rufiji Delta coastal region.<ref>{{cite web |title=Toothache 'made lion eat humans' |author=Daniel Dickinson |date=October 19, 2004 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3756180.stm |accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Terror from man-eating lions increasing in Tanzania |author=Ludger Kasumuni |date=August 28, 2006 |publisher=IPPmedia.com |url=http://www.ippmedia.com/ipp/guardian/2006/08/28/73305.html |accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref> Dr Rolf D. Baldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator, is reported to have commented that it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large [[abscess]] underneath a [[molar (tooth)|molar]] which was cracked in several places. He further commented that "This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/7836m621u8028177/|title=www.springerlink.com}}</ref> GTZ is the German development cooperation agency and has been working with the Tanzanian government on wildlife conservation for nearly two decades. Like in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem.

The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but the lesser known incidents in the late 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then Tanganyika (now Tanzania). George Rushby, game warden and professional hunter, eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations, is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 in what is now Njombe district.

Tsavo and Patterson body counts vary from a confirmed 28 victims up to a possible 140. While some authors disparage the actual number, it should be kept in mind that Patterson kept firm records of skilled-labor killed by the lions, not indigenous Africans. The toll could easily have been much higher.

====Baiting and taming====
[[Image:Circus Lion Tamer.jpg|right|thumb|19th century Etching of a lion tamer in a cage of lions.]]
{{main|Lion-baiting|Lion taming}}

Lion-baiting is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[Bait (dogs)|baiting]] of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the 17th century. It was finally banned in England in 1825.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}  

Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions generally for entertainment, either as part of an established [[circus]] or as an individual act, such as [[Siegfried & Roy]]. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as [[tigers]], [[leopards]] and [[cougars]]. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American [[Clyde Beatty]] (1903–1965).<ref>{{cite book | first=David | last=Feldman | authorlink=David Feldman (author) | coauthors= | year=1993 | title=How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | edition= | publisher=HarperCollins | location= | id=ISBN 0-06-016923-0 }}</ref>

[[Image:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|thumb|left|125|Sphinx, Giza]]

The Lion has been an icon of humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong but noble. A common depiction is their representation as "[[Monarch|king]] of the jungle" or "king of the beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness,<ref name ="Garai73">{{cite book |last=Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=671-21773-9}}</ref> as well as a symbol of bravery; [[Richard I of England]] was known as Richard the Lionheart.<ref name ="Garai73"/> ([[Lionheart]] would later be adopted as an album title by [[Kate Bush]], [[Maddy Prior]], and [[Saxon]], as well as in films and computer games.)

Representations of lions date back at least 32,000 years; the [[Lion man]] ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the [[Swabian Alb]] in southwestern [[Germany]] has been determined to be about 32,000 years old from the [[Aurignacian]] culture.<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny"/> Two lions were depicted mating  in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000 year old [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s in the [[Lascaux]] caves. Cave lions are also depicted in the [[Chauvet Cave]], discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000 years of age,<ref name = "Packer00"/> though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux.<ref>{{cite conference| first = Christian  | last = Züchner | title = Grotte Chauvet Archaeologically Dated

The [[Nemean Lion]] was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero [[Heracles]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Graves |first=R |authorlink=Robert Graves |title=Greek Myths |year=1955|publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-001026-2|pages=465-469 |chapter=The First Labour:The Nemean Lion}}</ref>

The lion was a prominent symbol in both the [[Old Babylonian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] periods. The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, is often referred to as the ''striding lion of Babylon''. It is in Babylon that the biblical [[Daniel]] is said to have been delivered from the lion's den. Such symbolism was appropriated by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq for their [[Lion of Babylon tank]], with the technology adapted from a Russian model.

[[Narasimha]] ("man-lion") (also spelt as ''Narasingh'', ''Narasinga'') is described as an incarnation ([[avatara]]) of [[Vishnu]] within the [[Puranic]] texts of [[Hinduism]];<ref> [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/18/en1 Bhag-P 1.3.18] "In the fourteenth incarnation, the Lord appeared as Nrisimha and bifurcated the strong body of the atheist Hiranyakasipu with His nails, just as a carpenter pierces cane." </ref> who takes the form of half-man / half-[[Asiatic Lions|lion]], having a human torso and lower body, but with a lion-like face and claws.<ref> [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/19-22/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.19-22] </ref> it is worshiped as "Lion God" thus Indian or [[Asiatic Lion]]s which were commonly found throughout most of India in ancient times are considered sacred by all [[Hindus]] in India. [[Singh]] is an [[ancient]] [[India]]n [[Vedic Sanskrit|vedic]] name meaning "Lion" ([[Asiatic Lion]]), dating back over 2000 years to [[ancient India]]. It was originally only used by [[Rajputs]] a [[Hindu]] [[Kshatriya]] or military [[caste]] in India. After the birth of the [[Khalsa]] brotherhood in 1699, the [[Sikh]]s also adopted the name "Singh" due to the wishes of [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs today, it is also used by over 20 million [[Sikhs]] worldwide.<ref>Dr. McCleod, Head of Sikh Studies, Department of South Asian Studies, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada</ref><ref>Khushwant Singh, ''A History of the Sikhs, Volume I''</ref> Found famously on numerous [[Flags]] and [[Coat of Arms]] all across Asia and Europe, the Asiatic Lions also stand firm on the [[National Emblem of India]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Government of India | title = Know India: State Emblem | work = National Portal of India | publisher = National Informatics Centre | date = 2005 | url = http://india.gov.in/knowindia/state_emblem.php | accessdate =2007-08-27}}</ref> Further south on the subcontinent, the lion is symbolic for the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]],<ref>{{cite web | author = Government of Sri Lanka | title = Sri Lanka National Flag | publisher = Government of Sri Lanka | date = | url = http://www.gov.lk/info/index.asp?mi=19&xp=52&xi=54&xl=3&o=0&t= | accessdate = 2007-08-06}}</ref> [[Sri Lanka]]'s ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan ''Sinhala'', meaning the "lion people" or "people with lion blood", while a sword wielding lion is the central figure on the national [[flag of Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web |  author = Government of Sri Lanka | title = Article 6: The National Flag | work = Official Website of the Government of Sri Lanka | publisher = Government of Sri Lanka | date =  | url = http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Schedle_2_Amd.html | accessdate = 2007-08-06}}</ref>

In the medieval period in Europe, lions were frequently depicted on [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], either as a device on shields themselves, or as [[supporters]]. The formal language of [[heraldry]], called [[blazon]], employs French terms to describe the images precisely. Such descriptions specified whether lions or other creatures were "rampant" or "passant", that is whether they were rearing or crouching.<ref name="Notre Dame">{{cite web | title =Heraldic Dictionary:Beasts  | publisher = University of Notre Dame | url =http://www.rarebooks.nd.edu/digital/heraldry/charges/lions.html | accessdate = 2007-07-20 }}</ref> 

[[Image:Una-lion.jpg|thumb|right|225| The lion is a popular symbol and mascot of high schools, colleges and universities throughout the United States.  This statue, depicting a lion, lioness and cubs, is one of many lion depictions on the campus of the [[University of North Alabama]].]]Lions continue to feature in modern tales, from the messianic [[Aslan]] in the ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' and following books from the [[Narnia]] series written by [[C.S. Lewis]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C.S. |authorlink=C. S.

Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 148, ISBN 0-517-500868 </ref> The word ''[[:tr:aslan|Aslan]]'' is Turkish for ''lion''.

The advent of moving pictures saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; one of the most iconic and widely recognised lions is [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]], the mascot for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) studios, which has been in use since the 1920s.<ref name="tvacres">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvacres.com/adanimals_leolion.htm | title = TV ACRES: Advertising Mascots - Animals - Leo the MGM Lion (MGM Studios) | work = TV Acres}}</ref> The 1960s saw the appearance of what is possibly the most famous lioness, the Kenyan animal [[Elsa the lioness|Elsa]] in the movie [[Born Free]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Adamson |first=George |authorlink=George Adamson |title= Bwana Game : the life story of George Adamson|year= 1969 |publisher=Fontana |location= |isbn=0006121454 }}</ref> based on the true-life international bestselling book of the same title.<ref>{{cite book |last=Adamson |first=Joy |authorlink=Joy Adamson |title=Born Free: A Lioness of Two Worlds |year=2000|origyear=1960 |publisher=Pantheon |location= |isbn=0375714383 }}</ref> The lion's role as King of the Beasts has been utilized in cartoons, from the 1950s manga which gave rise to the first Japanese colour TV animation series, [[Kimba the White Lion]], Leonardo Lion of [[King Leonardo and his Short Subjects]], both from the 1960s, up to the 1994 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animated feature film ''[[The Lion King]]'', which also featured the popular song [[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]] in its soundtrack. 

The lion is a common symbol or epithet for sporting teams, from national soccer teams such as [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Singapore national football team|Singapore]] to famous clubs such as the [[Detroit Lions]]<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = Official Website of the Detroit Lions | publisher = Detroit Lions | date = 2001 | url = http://www.detroitlions.com/index.cfm?homelink=y | accessdate = 2007-07-08}}</ref> of the NFL, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]<ref name="new crest">{{cite news | date=[[2004-11-12]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4008257.stm | title=Chelsea centenary crest unveiled | publisher=BBC | accessdate=2007-01-02 | author=}}</ref> and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] of the [[English Premier League]],<ref>{{cite web | author = Aston Villa F.C. | title = The Aston Villa Crest: 2007 Onwards... | publisher = Aston Villa F.C. | date = 2007 | url = http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/CrestTest/0,,10265,00.html | accessdate = 2007-08-06}}</ref> (and the Premiership itself) to a [[The Lions|host of smaller clubs]] around the world.
