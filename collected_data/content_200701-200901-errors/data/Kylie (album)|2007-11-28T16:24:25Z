'''''Kylie''''' is the debut [[album]] by Australian [[Pop music|pop]] singer [[Kylie Minogue]]. It was released by [[PWL]] on [[July 4]], [[1988]], and received mixed reviews. Chris True of [[All Music Guide]] described the album's songs as "dated at best", but wrote that Minogue's "cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable".<ref>Chris True.

Retrieved [[October 1]], [[2007]].</ref> ''Kylie'' was a number one album in Minogue's native [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and it produced three number one singles. In [[North America]] the album peaked low on the [[Billboard charts]].<ref name="offical">[http://www.kylie.com/2006_site/music/kylie.htm "Albums: ''Kylie''"]. Kylie.com.

==Background and recording==
In 1987, during a [[Fitzroy Football Club]] [[benefit concert]] with other ''[[Neighbours]]'' cast members, Minogue performed a [[cover version]] of "[[The Loco-Motion]]" and was signed to a recording contract with [[Mushroom Records]].<ref>Sean Smith (2002). ''Kylie Confidential''. Michael O'Mara Books Limited. ISBN 1-85479-415-9.</ref> The song was released as a single in Australia, and became the highest selling single of the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.kylie.com/2006_site/music/locomotion.htm "Singles: The Locomotion"]. Kylie.com. Retrieved [[October 2]], [[2007]].</ref> Its success resulted in Minogue traveling to [[London]] with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock, Aitken and Waterman]]. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote "[[I Should Be So Lucky]]" while she waited outside the studio.<ref name="transcript">[http://web.archive.org/web/20060107160910/http://www.abc.net.au/love/episodes/transcript4.htm "Transcript of television documentary ''Love is in the Air'', episode title "I Should Be So Lucky""]. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Television]]. [[November 2]], [[2003]]. Retrieved [[October 2]], [[2007]].</ref> Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, and returned home to Australia to work on ''Neighbours''.<ref name="transcript"/> The song became a chart success, and [[Mike Stock]] traveled to [[Melbourne]] to apologize to Minogue for forgetting about her previous recording session. Stock successfully convinced Minogue to return to London in the beginning of 1988 to record songs for her debut album.<ref name="transcript"/>
