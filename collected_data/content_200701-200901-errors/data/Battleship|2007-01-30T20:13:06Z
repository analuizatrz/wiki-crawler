'''Battleship''' is the name applied to very large, heavily-[[armour]]ed [[warship]]s with a main battery consisting of the largest [[caliber]] of [[gun]]s, specifically those ships built from the late 1800s through to the mid-20th century. The word ''battleship'' was coined around 1794 and is a shortened form of ''line-of-battle ship'' (otherwise known as ''[[ship of the line]]''), which referred to those vessels considered to be large enough to form part of the battle line during the [[Age of Sail]]. Even though they were eclipsed by the [[aircraft carrier]] as the deciding factor in naval warfare during [[World War II]] and are no longer used by any navy, the battleship remains both physically and psychologically the most powerful class of ship ever built.

==The Ship of the Line==
Main article: ''[[Ship of the line]]''

The origin of the term battleship comes from the [[ship of the line]], or 'line-of-battle-ship'. a large, unarmoured wooden sailing warship. The ship of the line mounted a [[artillery battery|battery]] of up to 120 [[gun]]s, always [[smoothbore]] [[cannon]] and [[carronade]]s. The sheer number of these weapons, fired [[broadside]], meant that the sailing battleship could wreck any wooden vessel, smashing the hull and masts and killing the crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, and sail tactics were dependent on the wind.

The ship of the line was a gradual evolution of a basic design dating as far back as the 1400s, but its basic design changed little between the adoption of [[line of battle]] tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s.

==Early steam battleships==
[[Image:Napoleon(1850).jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Le Napoléon (1850)|Le Napoléon]]'' (1850), the first steam battleship.]]

The first major change to the ship-of-the-line concept was the introduction of steam power as an auxiliary propulsion system.
 
The [[United Kingdom]] had developed a few harbour-protection units with screw/steam propulsion in the [[1840s]], called "[[blockship]]s" or "steam guard ships", which were conversions of smaller ships of the line cut down into floating batteries, with [[sailing ballast|ballast]] removed, and a jury rig with a medium 450 [[horsepower|hp]] (340&nbsp;kW) engine for speeds of 5.8—8.9 [[kts]] (11—16 km/h) installed. These ships, converted in [[1846]], were ''Blenheim'', [[HMS Ajax (1809)|''Ajax'']] and their sisters.<ref>"A Century of Naval Construction"</ref>

The [[French Navy]] ship of the line [[Le Napoléon (1850)|''Le Napoléon'']] became the first warship built from the keel up with steam power when she was launched in [[1850]].<ref>''"Napoleon (90 guns), the first purpose-designed screw line of battleships"'', "Steam, Steel and Shellfire", Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref> She was also the first one fitted with a screw propeller, and is considered to be the first true steam battleship.<ref>''"Hastened to completion Le Napoleon was launched on [[16 May]] [[1850]], to become the world's first true steam battleship"'', "Steam, Steel and Shellfire", Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref> In the United Kingdom, [[HMS Agamemnon (1852)|''Agamemnon'']] was ordered in [[1849]] as a response to rumours of the French development, and commissioned in [[1853]].

''Napoleon'' was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots, regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement.

Eight sister-ships to ''Le Napoléon'' were built in [[France]] over a period of ten years, as the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production, in number of both purpose-built and converted units. Altogether, France built 10 new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older battleship units, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.<ref>''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p.41)</ref>

In the end, France and the United Kingdom were the only two countries to develop fleets of wooden steam battleships, although several other navies are known to have had at least one unit, built or converted with British technical support, including [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sweden]], [[Naples]], [[Denmark]] and [[Austria]].

==Ironclads==
Main article: ''[[Ironclad warship]]''

The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionised warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the [[ironclad warship|ironclad]]: powered by steam, protected by metal armour, and armed with guns firing high-explosive shells. The first Royal Navy ship to bear the formal designation 'battleship' was the ironclad [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS Warrior]]. <ref>http://www.northwood.mod.uk/nwood/history/warrior/warrior.htm</ref>

====Explosive shells====

Alongside the spread of steam power, guns which fired explosive shells became more widespread. In the [[Crimean War]], the Russian Black Sea Fleet destroyed a flotilla of wooden Turkish ships. Later in the war French ironclads used similar weapons against the defenses at [[Kinburn]].

====Iron armour and construction====

[[Image:LaGloirePhotograph.jpg|thumb|300px|The French [[French battleship La Gloire|''La Gloire'']] (1858), the first ocean-going [[ironclad]] warship]]

Advances in [[metallurgy]] meant that ships could be covered with [[iron]] or built from iron. The development of cheaper, mass-produced iron in the early [[19th century]] meant that metal was readily available for [[shipbuilding]]. The development of high-explosive shells made its use as armour plate necessary.

In [[1859]], [[France]] launched [[FS Gloire (1858-1883)|''La Gloire'']], which was developed as a ship of the line, but cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most of her journeys, ''La Gloire'' was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armour. 

===Evolution in Ironclad warships===
Ironclad design saw wide experimentation. Different navies experimented with the positioning of guns, in [[turrets]] (like [[USS Monitor]]), [[centre-battery|centre-batteries]] or [[barbette]]s, or with the [[ram]] as the principal weapon. 

As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s steel was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable'']], laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 was a central [[artillery battery|battery]] and [[barbette]] warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.<ref>Conway Marine, ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'' (p96)</ref> Russia tried [[Russian battleship Novgorod|circular battleships]], which turned out to be one of the most unusual, if not outright bad, designs ever built: when the guns were fired the ship spun on its axis like a top.

Unlike the British the French often built a single example of each new design. Therefore the French navy was mocked as a "fleet of samples". Bizarre experimental warships appeared. A series of German warships was built with dozens of small guns to repel smaller crafts, a British vessel was built using a [[turbine]] engine (which ironically much later became the main propulsion system for all ships), while an entire class of French battleships such as the 1896 [[French battleship Bouvet|''Bouvet'']], known as "fierce-face" designs were developed without regard to symmetry or harmony of appearance -- favouring an aggressive look. Italy introduced a revolutionary design with the twin ships [[Duilio]] and [[Dandolo]], by incorporating the biggest and newest gun available: the 450 mm Armstrong, and using an increased armour and speed.

==The Pre-Dreadnought==
[[Image:HMS Devastation (1871).jpg|thumb|right|250px|HMS ''Devastation'', an example of a pre-''Dreadnought'' British battleship.]]
[[Image:JBMikasa.jpg|thumb|250px|Pre-''Dreadnought'' battleship [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']], flagship of the Japanese fleet at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], in 1905]]
By the late 19th Century designs had gradually settled down what has become known as the '''pre-Dreadnought battleship'''. These were ships heavily armoured, mounting a mixed battery of guns, and without masts. 

An early design of recognisably Pre-Dreadnought design is the British [[Devastation class battleship|''Devastation'' class]] of 1871. However, the term generally refers to battleships built in the period 1890 &ndash; 1905 and usually having a displacement of 9,000 &ndash; 16,000 tons, a speed of 13 &ndash; 18 [[knot (speed)|knots]], and an armament of four "big guns", usually 12 inches (305&nbsp;mm) in bore diameter, in two centreline turrets, fore and aft, plus a heavy intermediate battery of typically eight 8-inch (200&nbsp;mm) guns carried in double turrets on the superstructure corners, and a secondary battery of smaller guns. 

The 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) mains and 8-inch (200&nbsp;mm) intermediates were generally used for battleship to battleship combat, while the secondaries (typically 7-inch (178&nbsp;mm) to 5-inch (127&nbsp;mm)) were reserved for smaller threats, such as [[cruiser]]s and the new [[destroyer]]s. 

A small number of designs, including the American [[Kearsarge class battleship|''Kearsarge'']] and [[Virginia class battleship|''Virginia'']] classes, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch (200&nbsp;mm) intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch (300&nbsp;mm) primary, with less than stellar results. Nearly universally, recoil factors resulted in the 8-inch (200&nbsp;mm) battery being completely unusable. Additionally, the inability to train separately the primary and intermediate armament led to significant tactical limitation. Turrets, armour plate, and [[steam engine]]s were all improved over the years, and [[torpedo]] tubes were introduced. However, events in 1906 sparked off another naval arms race.

The nations possessing significant battle-fleets during this period were the United Kingdom, France and Russia, plus newcomers Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]] and Italy, while Turkey and Spain built small numbers of armoured [[frigate]]s and [[cruiser]]s. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, and the United States built smaller "coastal battleships" called [[Panzership]]s or [[Monitor (warship)|Battlemonitors]] in the under 6,000 ton range. 

Some navies experimented with "second class battleships", vessels that were designed to be less expensive than full battleships but also at the cost of power; these were not effective for navies of nations with global ambitions. Though they were later called [[armored cruiser]]s the United States experimented with four such ships, including the first two American battleships, [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|''Maine'']] and [[USS Texas (1895)|''Texas'']].

==The Dreadnought Era==
[[Image:Vittoriocuniberti001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Vittorio Cuniberti]]
[[Image:IJN Satsuma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']], the first ship to be designed and laid down as an "all-big-gun" battleship]]
===Cuniberti's idea===
The idea of "all-big-gun" warships, capable of firing powerful guns from a long distance seems to have emerged as the threat from torpedoes became more potent. The Italian naval architect [[Vittorio Cuniberti]] first articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903, stressing a large armoured warship with a single [[caliber]] of guns as its only armament. When the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] didn't pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in [[Jane's Fighting Ships|Jane's]] propagating his concept, proposing the "ideal" future British battleship of 17,000&nbsp;tons, with a main battery of twelve 12&nbsp;inch (30&nbsp;cm) guns, 12&nbsp;inch [[belt armour]], and speed of 24&nbsp;knots (44&nbsp;km/h).

===Tsushima===
The [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-1905) provided operational experience to validate Cuniberti's concept. The [[Russia]]n Navy had steamed more than 18,000 miles from its [[Baltic Sea]] ports only to be annihilated by a superior Japanese fleet near the end of May, 1905 in the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. The battle was literally modern versus older ships, with the exception of four new French-designed [[Borodino class battleship|''Borodino'' class battleship]]s in the Russian fleet. The big 12-inch guns of the Japanese decided the outcome. But what did not escape the designers of ships and planners of war were several factors clearly demonstrated by the aftermath of the battle:

* Big guns of a single caliber were more effective than a mix of different calibers.
* The greater range of big guns meant that a battleship could choose its fighting distance without being hit by the enemy.
* The faster a battleship could travel meant overall control of the outcome of the battle itself.

The events of the battle confirmed to the world that only the biggest guns mattered in naval battles at that time. As secondary guns grew in size, spotting and discriminating between splashes of main and secondary guns became problematic. The Battle of Tsushima demonstrated that damage from the main guns was much greater than secondary guns. In addition, the battle demonstrated the practicality of gun battles beyond the range of secondary guns (12,000&nbsp;yards / 11&nbsp;km). The United States, Japan, and Britain all realized this and launched plans for all-big-gun ships.

===Jackie Fisher and the ''Dreadnought''===
None of this was lost on the head of the British [[Admiralty]], [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]]. A far-sighted yet combative man, he saw just where the [[Royal Navy]] stood as opposed to the rest of the world's navies and took action as soon as he was promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet]]. Amidst outrage within the Royal Navy and public controversy, he ruthlessly sold off 90 obsolete and small ships and put a further 64 into reserve, describing all these vessels as "too weak to fight and too slow to run away", and "a miser's hoard of useless junk". This freed up crews and money to increase the number of large modern ships in home waters. He further ordered the creation of specific schools dedicated to [[engineering]], [[gun]]nery, and modern [[naval tactics]].
[[Image:Jackie Fisher.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Jackie Fisher]]
Fisher also took the lead with a revolutionary new warship based upon the lessons of Tsushima: [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']], launching it in 1906, just 11 months from the laying of her keel. ''Dreadnought'' carried ten 12-inch guns and was powered not by [[reciprocating engine]]s, but by [[steam turbine]]s, which was revolutionary for large ships. Previous ships powered by reciprocating steam engines were, in practice, limited by engine vibration to 18 [[knot (speed)|knots]] (33&nbsp;km/h). Even at that speed, vibration limited aiming ability and the engines wore out quickly. ''Dreadnought'' had a top speed of 21 knots (39&nbsp;km/h). It was the first of the new breed of "all-big-gun" battleships. 
[[Image:HMS Dreadnought (1906).jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]]]
Partially as a consequence of this new philosophy and of its powerful new turbine engine, ''Dreadnought'' dispensed almost completely with the smaller calibre secondary armament carried by her immediate predecessors, allowing her to carry more heavy calibre guns than any other battleship built up to that time. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three along the centreline (one forward and two aft) and two on the wings, giving her twice the broadside of anything else afloat. She retained a number of 12-pounder (3-inch) [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] cannon for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armour was strong enough that she could conceivably go head-to-head with any other ship afloat in a gun battle and win.

Although there were some problems with the ship (the design's [[wing turrets]] strained the hull when firing broadside, and the top of the thickest armour belt lay below the waterline when the ship was fully loaded), ''Dreadnought'' was so revolutionary that battleships built before her were afterward known as "pre-Dreadnoughts", and those following as "Dreadnoughts". Vessels built within a few years that were bigger and mounted more powerful guns were referred to as "super dreadnoughts". In a stroke, ''Dreadnought'' had made all existing battleships obsolete; including those of the Royal Navy, which embarked on a programme of building ever-more-powerful Dreadnought designs.

However, by introducing a jump in battleship design instead of having a lead of over twenty of the latest design of battleship over their nearest competitors, the Royal Navy now had a lead of only one: ''Dreadnought'' herself. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts to avoid being overtaken by the United Kingdom. The Royal Navy, labouring under the expectation that it should be able to match any two of its competitors combined, began demanding increasingly unaffordable sums from the government for dreadnought construction. The government, already burdened with financial crises caused by the [[Second Boer War]] and a voting population demanding more government expenditure on [[social welfare provision |welfare]] and [[public works]], could not afford to squander precious money on even more dreadnoughts, allowing rival navies, particularly the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] of the [[German Empire]], to catch up with the United Kingdom's battleship forces. Even after ''Dreadnought'''s commission, battleships continued to grow in size, guns, and technical proficiency as countries vied to have the best ships. By 1914 ''Dreadnought'' was outmoded. This expensive arms race would not end until the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, e.g. the [[Geneva Naval Conference|First Geneva Naval Conference]] (1927), the [[London Naval Treaty|First London Naval Treaty]] (1930), the [[Second Geneva Naval Conference]] (1932), and finally the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] (1936), which all meant limitations for major warships. These treaties would effectively end on [[September 1]], [[1939]], with the beginning of [[World War II]], but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply.

National pride in the early 20th century was largely based on how many of these ships a navy had, and details were published in the newspapers for the public to avidly follow; the naval arms race which ''Dreadnought'' sparked, especially between the United Kingdom and the young German Empire, was to create powerful shockwaves.

The American [[South Carolina class battleship|''South Carolina'' class]] battleships were begun before ''Dreadnought'', and had most of her features, except for the [[steam turbine]]s; however, their final design was not completed before ''Dreadnought,'' and their construction took much longer. Smaller than ''Dreadnought'' at 16,000 tons standard displacement, they carried eight 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns in four twin turrets arranged in superfiring pairs fore and aft along the centreline of the keel. This arrangement gave ''South Carolina'' and her sister ''Michigan'' a broadside equal to ''Dreadnought's'' without requiring the cumbersome [[wing turrets]] that were a feature of the first few British dreadnought classes. The superfiring arrangement had not been proven until after ''South Carolina'' went to sea, and it was initially feared that the weakness of the previous [[Virginia class battleship|''Virginia'']] class ship's stacked turrets would repeat itself. Half of the first ten U.S. dreadnoughts used the older [[reciprocating engine]]s rather than steam turbines. ''North Dakota'' and the ''Florida'' and ''Wyoming'' classes used turbines while the ''South Carolina'' class, ''Delaware'' and the ''New York'' class used vertical triple expansion (VTE) [[steam engine]]s, this was owed to the much lower fuel efficiency of the early turbines.

===The "super dreadnoughts"===
[[Image:2nd Battle Squadron.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Orion class battleship|''Orion'' class battleships]] in line.]]
The arrival of super dreadnoughts is not as clearly identified with a single ship in the same way that the dreadnought era was initiated by HMS ''Dreadnought''. However, it is commonly held to start with the British [[Orion class battleship|''Orion'' class]], and for the German navy with the [[König class battleship|''König''s]]. The super dreadnoughts also saw the introduction of geared turbines and [[turbo-electric]] propulsion as ways to improve the fuel efficiency of the turbines, and this robbed reciprocating machinery of its last remaining advantage. Geared turbines introduced a reduction [[gearbox]] between the turbine and the propellers (screws), this allowed the turbine to spin very, very quickly while the propellers could turn at a much more sedate and [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamically]] efficient speed. Turbo-electric propulsion took this one step further; in a turbo-electric setup, the turbines turned an [[electrical generator]], which fed electricity to [[electric motor]]s that turned the [[driveshaft]]s.

The ''Orions'' were just one step in a breathtakingly rapid evolution that ''Dreadnought'' had initiated. What made them "super" was the unprecedented jump in displacement of 2,000 tons over the previous class, the introduction of the heavier 13.5&nbsp;inch (343&nbsp;mm) gun, and the distribution of all the main armament on the centreline of the keel. Thus, in the four years that separated the laying down of ''Dreadnought'' and [[HMS Orion (1910)|''Orion'']], displacement had increased by 25%, and weight of broadside had doubled. Because of British [[Admiralty]] insistence on open sighting hoods, however, the raised turrets in this class could not fire on the axial line without concussing the gunlayers in the lower turret, a feature avoided in the [[South Carolina class battleship|''South Carolina'' class]].

Super dreadnoughts also incorporated, during construction, the latest technical gunnery advances. Thus they received director control, designed from the outset with larger observation positions with [[rangefinder]]s and [[repeater]]s aloft, [[rangekeeper|mechanical calculators and predictors]] in protected positions below, and very advanced alignment and correction devices for the guns.

The design weakness of super dreadnoughts, which distinguished them from post-World War I designs, was armour disposition. Their design placed emphasis on vertical protection which was needed in short range battles. These ships were capable of engaging the enemy at 20,000 metres, but were vulnerable to the angle of fire that came at such ranges. Post-war designs typically had 5 to 6 inches (127&nbsp;mm to 152&nbsp;mm) of deck armour to defend against this dangerous, [[plunging fire]]. The concept of [[zone of immunity]] became a major part of the thinking behind battleship design. Lack of underwater protection was also a weakness of these pre-World War I designs which were developed only as the threat of the [[torpedo]] became real. The United States Navy's "standard"-type battleships, beginning with the [[Nevada class battleship|''Nevada'' class]], or "Battleship 1912", were designed with long-range engagements and plunging fire in mind; the first of these ships, [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|USS ''Nevada'']], was laid down in 1912, five years before the [[Battle of Jutland]] taught the dangers of long-range fire to European navies. Important features of the standard battleships were "all or nothing" armor and "raft" construction, a philosophy under which only the parts of the ship worth armoring with the thickest armor that could be fitted to the ship were worth armoring at all, and that enough reserve buoyancy should be contained within the resulting armored "raft" to float the entire ship in the event that the unarmored bow and stern be thoroughly riddled and flooded. This concept was not fully validated until 1942, when a surface battle between the [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|Japanese battleship ''Kirishima'']] and the American battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']] during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], resulted in ''South Dakota'''s survival despite her bow and stern becoming fully flooded due to battle damage. This was the last solely battleship-to-battleship surface action. ''Kirishima'', herself an uprated [[battlecruiser]], was blasted into a blazing wreck by ''Washington'' and scuttled off [[Savo Island]].

The standard battleships had identical handling characteristics to the previous two class of dreadnoughts, with a maximum speed of 21 knots and a tactical diameter of 700 yards at that speed, giving the U.S. Navy an interwar battle line of completely homogenous handling characteristics, in keeping with the naval strategy theories of Rear Admiral [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. Admiral Mahan held that sea power was the key to world power and victory would go to the combatant who controlled the enemy's ports, and that strategic advantage would come to the navy that could most efficiently destroy the enemy's fleets. Given that, the U.S. Navy did not desire avoidance of combat with the enemy; American strategic thinking held that approaching enemy strategic targets would force the enemy to come out, give battle and be destroyed.

The super dreadnoughts that had already been built were surpassed by designs developed during the World War I. Any remaining that served in World War II had all either received extensive modifications, or were a source of extreme anxiety because of their vulnerability to more modern battleships, or both.

==World War I==
[[Image:British Grand Fleet 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[British Grand Fleet]] during [[World War I]].]]
[[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] had been engaged in a naval [[arms race]] since the 1890s. The building of ''Dreadnought'' actually helped Germany in this, as instead of having a lead of 15 or so ships of the latest type, the United Kingdom now had a lead of just one. Furthermore, the United Kingdom's policy of maintaining a navy larger than the world's second and third largest navies combined was becoming unsustainably expensive. All other battleship navies switched over in the next few years to building Dreadnought-type ships as well.

At this point in time, the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom had ruled the seas for at least a century, but the German emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and his naval minister, [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], set out to change that, in part for strategic reasons, but mainly due to a simple desire to challenge the United Kingdom. The culmination of this race led to a stalemate in [[World War I]]. The [[High Seas Fleet|German High Seas Fleet]] and the [[British Grand Fleet]] were too valuable to be risked in battle and so both spent the majority of the war in port, waiting to respond should the other go to sea. Paradoxically, the ships were too valuable (strategically, at least) to leave at port, and too expensive to use in battle. Apart from some operations in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] against Russia, Germany's main fleet limited itself to making [[battlecruiser]] raids on the British east coast, in an attempt to lure part of the British fleet out so that it could be defeated by the waiting High Seas Fleet. In their turn, the British made sweeps of the [[North Sea]], and both sides laid extensive [[naval mine|minefields]]. Although there were several naval battles, the only engagement between the main British and German fleets was the abortive [[Battle of Jutland]], a German tactical victory of sorts (fourteen British ships were sunk to eleven German, although the High Seas Fleet fled the field) but a British strategic victory, as although the German fleet was not destroyed it took longer to come back to operational status than the British and mostly remained in port for the rest of the war.

After World War I, the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] required that most of the High Seas Fleet be interned at [[Scapa Flow]], [[Scotland]]. Most of these ships were subsequently [[Scuttling|scuttled]] by their German crews on [[21 June]] [[1919]] just before the signature of the peace treaty, which provided the ships - which still were German property so far - to be handed over to the victors. As far as the German sailors were concerned, they were undefeated; it was felt that their ships should not fall into the hands of the British.

==Decline of the battleship==
The decline of the battleship was mainly due to two factors: the first one was the cost of maintaining a battle ready fleet of warships. This cost had steadily increased since the dawn of the battleships, and by the end of the First World War, the cost of these ships, with their ever increasing size, speed, weaponry and armament, had become unbearable in the long run. A series of naval treaties were signed in the 1920s in order to limit this maelstrom. Although the treaties were abandoned by WWII, most nations were reluctant to build new and costly warships, and by the 1950s, no new battleships were built and most of the remaining ones were decommissioned after the [[Korean War]].

The other decisive factor was the rise of the aircraft era. In comparison to the relatively limited range of artillery firepower, aircraft could bring death and destruction from hundreds of miles away. With the large scale introduction of [[aircraft carrier]]s, the seas suddenly became a more deadly place for major warships.

===Billy Mitchell's tests===
[[Image:Ostfriesland bombed by Mitchells team p19.jpg|thumb|Right|250px|Bombing tests which sank SMS ''Ostfriesland'', September, 1921]]
In the 1920s, General [[Billy Mitchell]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps]], believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, presented his theory which claimed that aircraft could sink ships "under war conditions". This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell, through political maneuvering, was nevertheless allowed to conduct a series of bombing tests on battleships. In [[1921]], he successfully sank numerous ships, including the stationary German WWI battleship, the [[USS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']] and the American [[Pre-dreadnought|pre-dreadnought battleship]] [[USS Alabama (BB-8)|''Alabama'']].

Although Mitchell had stressed "war-time conditions", the ships were stationary, defenseless targets and the sinking of ''Ostfriesland'' was accomplished by violating agreed-upon rules that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions; Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rule and quickly sank the ship in a coordinated attack. This proved&mdash;at least to Mitchell&mdash;that surface fleets were obsolete. In [[1922]] he met the like-minded Italian air power theorist [[Giulio Douhet]] on a trip to Europe and soon after an excerpted translation of Douhet's ''The Command of the Air'' began to circulate in the Air Service.

In [[1924]], Mitchell's superiors sent him to [[Hawaii]], then [[Asia]], to get him off the front pages. Mitchell came back with a 324-page report that predicted future war with [[Japan]], including the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. His report was mostly ignored.

==World War II==
With the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, the major navies of the world scaled back their battleship programs, with numerous ships on all sides scrapped or re-purposed. With extensions, that treaty lasted until 1936, when the major navies of the world began a new arms race. Famous ships like [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], [[HMS Prince of Wales (1939)|''Prince of Wales'']] and [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] were all launched in the next few years. During World War II naval warfare evolved quickly and battleships lost their position as the principal ships of the fleet, despite the fact that naval warfare planners still believed in the power of the battleship. 

In the early stages of the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Battle of the Atlantic]], Germany's surface units threatened the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] convoys supplying the United Kingdom, so the British surface units devoted themselves to protecting the [[convoy]]s, and seeking out and trying to destroy the German ships. The German raiders recorded early successes, with the [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] surprising and sinking the aircraft carrier [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] off western [[Norway]] in June 1940, while the [[pocket battleship]] ''[[Admiral Graf Spee]]'' had some success in the South Atlantic by the end of 1939. On [[24 May]] [[1941]] during an attempt to break out into the North Atlantic, battleship ''Bismarck'' sank the battlecruiser [[HMS Hood (1918)|HMS ''Hood'']]. The Royal Navy hunted down ''Bismarck''; an attack by [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] [[biplane]] torpedo-bombers from the [[aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|''Ark Royal'']] disabled her steering and allowed the British heavy units to catch up; ''Bismarck'' would be sunk on [[May 27]].

The loss of the ''Bismarck'' was just the beginning of the power being wielded by the aircraft against a [[capital ship]], and events would soon follow in which planners would be forced to adopt the aircraft carrier as the principle player in naval warfare.

===The attack on the Taranto naval base===
:''See also [[Battle of Taranto]]''
Billy Mitchell's ideas would be tested for the first time in real war-like conditions. The first example of this was the British air attack on the Italian naval base at [[Taranto]] that took place on the night of [[11 November]] — [[12 November]] [[1940]] during World War II. The Royal Navy launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history, flying a small number of aircraft from an aircraft carrier in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and attacking the Italian fleet at Taranto. The effect of the British aircraft on the Italian warships led pundits around the world to predict the end of the "big gun" ship and the rise of naval air power.

===Pearl Harbor===
:''See also the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]''
The Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, [[December 7]], [[1941]], managed to sink or damage most of the U.S. battleships in the Pacific region, an act that proved Mitchell's theory and showed the vulnerability of major warships lying at anchor, as at Taranto. While two battleships were sunk and the remainder heavily damaged, a major stroke of luck had occurred: the American aircraft carriers were out to sea and evaded detection. They in turn would take up the fight, eventually turning the tide of the war in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

===Sinking of HMS ''Prince of Wales''===
:''See also the [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse]]''
The sinking of the British battleship ''Prince of Wales'' and her escort, the battlecruiser HMS ''Repulse'' further demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack, in this case while at sea without air cover. Both ships were on their way to assist in the defense of [[Singapore]] when they were caught by Japanese land-based [[bomber]]s and [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] on [[December 10]], [[1941]]. ''Prince of Wales'' has the distinction of being the first battleship sunk by aircraft while underway and able to defend herself.

===Other actions===
The three [[United States Pacific Fleet]] carriers which survived Pearl Harbor ([[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS ''Saratoga'']], [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']], and [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'']]) would take part in operations which turned the tide of the war in the Pacific: the battles of [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]]. As the war progressed, battleships became festooned with [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]] such as the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm Bofors gun]]. Nonetheless, the advent of air power spelled doom for the battleship.

Battleships in the Pacific ended up primarily performing shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. The largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's ''Yamato'' class battleships, designed as a principal strategic weapon never realized their potential. During the World War II [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] the second unit of the class, the [[Musashi|''Musashi'']], was sunk by aircraft attacks long before she could come within striking range of the American fleet. The last active German battleship, [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], had lurked until late into the war in Norwegian [[fjord]]s protected by [[anti-submarine weapon]]s and shore based anti-aircraft guns. She was severely damaged in September 1943 during [[Operation Source]], a daring covert attack by British mini-subs]], and ultimately sunk by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircraft using [[tallboy bomb]]s.
[[Image:USS Pennsylvania moving into Lingayen Gulf.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)|''Pennsylvania'']] leading battleship [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|''Colorado'']] and cruisers [[USS Louisville (CA-28)|''Louisville'']], [[USS Portland (CA-33)|''Portland'']], and [[USS Columbia (CL-56)|''Columbia'']] into [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Philippines]], January 1945]]

The second half of World War II saw the last battleship duels. The [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|''USS Massachusetts'']] fought [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] battleship [[French battleship Jean Bart (1940)|''Jean Bart'']] on [[27 October]],[[1942]]. In the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Battle of Guadalcanal]] on [[November 15]] [[1942]], the United States battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']] fought and destroyed the Japanese battleship [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']]. In the [[Battle of North Cape]], on [[26 December]] [[1943]], [[HMS Duke of York (1940)|HMS ''Duke of York'']] and destroyers sank the German ''Scharnhorst'' off Norway. And in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] on [[25 October]] [[1944]] six battleships, led by admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]] of the U.S. 7th Fleet sank the Japanese admiral [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s battleships [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']] and [[Japanese battleship Fusō|''Fusō'']] during the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]].

Nevertheless, the [[Battle off Samar]] on [[25 October]] [[1944]] during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] proved that battleships still were a lethal weapon. The indecision of Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] and the valor of the American [[destroyer escort]] and fighter crews, who gamely put their ships and aircraft in harm's way against the much heavier battleships, saved the American [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] of "Taffy 3" from being pounded to the bottom of the ocean by gunfire of [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']] and [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] and their [[cruiser]] host. Miraculously, only [[USS Gambier Bay|''Gambier Bay'']] and four [[destroyer]]s were lost due to surface action. This was primarily due to the fact that Kurita had ordered his ships to use armor piercing rounds, believing they were attacking the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], composed of heavily-armored [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'']] and [[Ticonderoga class aircraft carrier|''Ticonderoga'']] class carriers, which simply went through the lightly armored American ships instead of exploding inside them. When they finally realized that the armor piercing rounds were not working, the Japanese fleet had already suffered heavy damage from the suicidally brave American forces. Kurita's forces were fortunate that they had not actually found the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was armed with over 1,000 combat aircraft and protected by seven battleships commanded by Rear Admiral [[Willis Lee]].
[[Image:Yamato1945.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Yamato'' under air attack, March 1945.]]

During the later stages of the war, the [[Allies_of_World_War_II |Allied]] battleships were literally covered with anti-aircraft guns and were also equipped with [[radar]]. To counter this defense, the [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis Powers]] implemented different methods. The Italians used with success their tested method of having [[frogmen]] delivering explosive charges to the ships, and managed to sink the [[HMS Valiant (1914)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and the [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] in the harbor of [[Alexandria]]. The Germans developed a series of stand-off weapons, e.g. the [[precision-guided munition|guided bomb]] [[Fritz X]], with which they managed to sink the Italian battleship [[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|''Roma'']] and severely damaged another battleship, the [[Italian battleship Littorio|''Italia'']], while they were underway to surrender. One week later, the Germans scored another hit with a Fritz X on the British battleship [[HMS Warspite (1913)|HMS ''Warspite'']]. The bomb penetrated six decks before exploding against the bottom of the ship, blowing a large hole in her. The ship took in a total of 5,000 tonnes of water, lost steam (and thus all power, both to the ship herself and to all her systems), and had to be taken in tow. She reached Malta but was out of action for the next 12 months. The Japanese, on the other hand, tried to sink Allied ships through [[suicide attacks|suicide air attacks]] - the so-called [[kamikaze]]. Although many U.S. battleships took hits by kamikaze, none were seriously damaged, due to their thick armor. They were much more successful against lesser-armored ships.

As a result of the changing technology, plans for even larger battleships, the American [[Montana class battleship|''Montana'' class]], British [[Lion class battleship|''Lion'' Class]] and Japanese [[Super Yamato class|"Super ''Yamato''" class]], were cancelled. At the end of the war, almost all the world's battleships were decommissioned or scrapped. It is notable that most battleship losses occurred while in port. No battleship was lost to heavy bombers on the open seas, which was considered the most grave aerial peril to battleships prior to World War II due to [[Billy Mitchell]] and the [[SMS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']] experiment. The real aerial peril to battleships came from small, one to three-man [[dive bomber]]s and [[torpedo bomber]]s like the [[SBD Dauntless]] and [[TBF Avenger]]; in fact, it was the latter that sank the last battleship of the war, the ''Yamato'', as she tried to make a run for [[Okinawa]] to prevent Allied landings there in May, 1945.

==Post World War II==

[[Image:Missouri missile.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] launches a [[Tomahawk missile]]]]
After World War II, several navies retained battleships, but they were now outclassed by carriers. The Italian [[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|''Giulio Cesare'']] was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed ''Novorossiysk''; it was sunk by a German mine in the [[Black Sea]] on [[29 October]] [[1955]]. The two [[Doria class battleship|''Doria'' class]] ships were scrapped in the late 1950s. The French [[French battleship Lorraine|''Lorraine'']] was scrapped in 1954, [[French battleship Richelieu|''Richelieu'']] in 1964 and [[French battleship Jean Bart|''Jean Bart'']] in 1970. The United Kingdom's four surviving [[King George V class battleship (1939)|''King George V'' class]] ships were scrapped towards the end of the 1950s, and [[HMS Vanguard (1944)|''Vanguard'']] followed around 1960. All other surviving British battleships had been scrapped in the late 1940s. The Soviet Union's ''Petropavlovsk'' was scrapped in 1953, [[Sevastopol (disambiguation)|''Sevastopol'']] in 1957 and [[Soviet battleship Gangut|''Gangut'']] in 1959. Brazil's [[Brazilian battleship Minas Gerais|''Minas Gerais'']] was scrapped in 1954, and her sister ship [[Brazilian battleship Sao Paulo|''São Paulo'']] sank en route to the breakers during a storm in 1951. [[Argentina]] kept its two [[Rivadavia class battleship|''Rivadavia'' class]] ships until 1956. Chile kept ''Almirante Latorre'' (formerly HMS ''Canada'') until 1959. The Turkish battlecruiser ''Yavuz'' (formerly the German [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']], launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell it back to Germany was refused. Sweden had several small coastal defense battleships, one of which, ''[[HMS Gustav V|Gustav V]]'', survived until 1970. The Russians also scrapped four large incomplete cruisers in the late 1950s, whilst plans to build new battleships were abandoned following the death of Stalin in 1953. There were also several old ships of the line still used as housing ships or storage depots. Of these, all but HMS ''Victory'' were sunk or scrapped by 1957.

===Return of the ''Iowa''-class===
The battleships gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. Shipborne artillery support is considered by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] as more accurate, more effective and less expensive than aerial strikes. [[Radar]] and computer controlled gunfire can be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The United States recommissioned all four [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class]] battleships for the [[Korean War]] and the [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']] for the [[Vietnam War]]. These were primarily used for shore bombardment. As part of [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to build a [[600-ship Navy]] in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of ''[[Kirov]]'' by the Soviet Union the United States recommissioned all four ''Iowa'' class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in [[carrier battle group]]s, or led their own battle groups in a [[battleship battle group]]. These were modernized to carry [[Tomahawk missile]]s, with ''New Jersey'' seeing action bombarding [[Lebanon]], while [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']] fired their 16-inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991. ''Wisconsin'' served as the [[Tomahawk missile|TLAM]] strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of [[Operation Desert Storm]] and firing a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. This will most likely be the last combat action ever by a battleship.

All four ''Iowas'' were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service. ''Missouri'', and ''New Jersey'' are now museums at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden, N.J.]] respectively. ''Wisconsin'' is a museum (at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk, Va.]]), and was recently removed from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. However, pending donation, the public can still only tour the deck, since the rest of the ship is closed off for dehumidification. [[USS Iowa (BB-61)|''Iowa'']] (at [[Suisun Bay]]) and ''Wisconsin'' were, until recently, in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Naval Reserve Fleet]], and, if the need arises, the most likely to be re-activated.

==Today==
===Museum ships===
Battleships still in existence as museums include the American [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|USS ''Massachusetts'']], [[USS North Carolina (BB-55)|''North Carolina'']], [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|''Alabama'']], [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']], and [[USS Texas (BB-35)|''Texas'']], the British [[Mary Rose|HMS ''Mary Rose'']], [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']], the Japanese [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']], the Swedish [[Regalskeppet Vasa|''Vasa'']], the Dutch [[HNLMS Buffel|''Buffel'']] and [[HNLMS Schorpioen|''Schorpioen'']], and the Chilean [[Huáscar (ship)|''Huáscar'']]. (See [[:Category:Museum ships]] for other museum ships). Like museum ships, [[HMS Victory]] is open to the public, but she is technically still in service with the Royal Navy, being the flagship of the [[Second Sea Lord]]/Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command and the oldest warship still in commission in any navy.<ref>[http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3086]</ref>

===United States Navy===
USS ''Iowa'' and USS ''Wisconsin'' had been, until fiscal year 2006, maintained in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996, which includes the following battleship readiness requirements:

# List and maintain at least two ''Iowa'' class battleships on the Naval Vessel Register that are in good condition and able to provide adequate fire support for an amphibious assault;
# Retain the existing logistical support necessary to keep at least two ''Iowa''-class battleships in active service, including technical manuals, repair and replacement parts, and ordnance; and
# Keep the two battleships on the register until the Navy certified that it has within the fleet an operational surface fire support capability that equals or exceeds the fire support capability that the ''Iowa''-class battleships would be able to provide for the Marine Corps' amphibious assaults and operations ashore. (Section 1011)<ref>[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm Information from the Federation of American Scientists website]</ref>

Plans in the United States Navy had called for keeping ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' on the register until the naval surface fire support gun and missile development programs achieve operational capability, which was expected to occur sometime between 2003 and 2008. Yet the [[littoral combat ship]]s and [[Zumwalt class destroyer]]s are still under construction, and neither will have the capability to put as much ordnance on target as the Iowas. Since ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' were removed from the Naval Vessel Register interest groups will request that they be placed on donation hold and transferred for use as museums.

The long-term plan to remove ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' and donate them as museum ships is not without controversy; the [[United States Marine Corps]] has fought to get both battleships reinstated. The USMC believes that the current naval surface fire support gun and missile programs will not be able to provide adequate fire support for an amphibious assault or onshore operations;<ref>The USMC has revised its Naval Surface Gunfire Support requirements, leaving some questions as to whether or not the [[Zumwalt class destroyer]] can meet the Marine qualifications</ref><ref>[http://www.fas.org/man/gao/gao95160.htm Informationefrom the Federation of American Scientists Website]</ref> additionally, the USMC is claimed not to think that the Navy's [[Zumwalt class destroyer|Zumwalt class]] program will be an acceptable replacement for the battleships, and points out that these ships will not be available until 2013 in any event.<ref>[http://armedservices.house.gov/NDAA2007CommiteeReport.pdf National Defense Authorization Act of 2007, pg 193 and 194]</ref> 

Refurbishing ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' has been priced at either $430 million for a 14-month program or $500 million for a 10-month program. These figures are however now more than ten years old, and assumes restoration of the battleships to a 1991 configuration, which includes several obsolete systems.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/htext/d0539r.html U.S. Government Accountability Office; ''Question #2 Battleship reactivation'']</ref>

==Psychological aspects==
Battleships were designed to engage similar enemy warships with direct or indirect fire from an arsenal of main guns. As a secondary role, they were capable of bombarding targets on and near an enemy coast to support infantry assaults. A third role for the battleships emerged during World War II, when they used their powerful anti-aircraft weaponry to screen aircraft carriers from enemy air attacks. After World War II some continued to be used for shore bombardment and as [[missile]] platforms until the early 1990s.

Prior to the aircraft carrier, these "capital" ships represented their respective countries. The nation with the most powerful battleships could rule the seas, thus more able to project their military might. Any nation without battleships was not considered a major military opponent, as they could not interfere with military operations over seas. The nation with the most powerful and majestic battleships could proudly show her power and prestige, as modern steel battleships were the most highly technologically advanced machines ever built during those times; by politely "showing the flag" they could warn others of their military might.

The presence of a battleship also invokes a power implied which is not present in any other ship. In 1946, USS ''Missouri'' was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the Balkan region. In September 1983, when [[Druze]] militia in [[Lebanon]]'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS ''New Jersey'' stopped the firing; by that December ''New Jersey'' fired on those mountains with her big 16-inch guns, and like Vietnam before, would cause an evacuation of enemy forces twenty miles deep.

==Fictional appearances==
[[Image:NGE Iowas.png|thumb|right|250px|Battleships have often appeared in military oriented science fiction stories. Pictured here are the unfinished ''Iowa''-class battleships [[USS Illinois (BB-65)|''Illinois'']] and [[USS Kentucky (BB-66)|''Kentucky'']] in the 1995 [[anime]] series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''.]]
The term "battleship" often makes an appearance in military-oriented [[science fiction]], where they often occupy a role similar to their historical one. It should be noted that some writers have come to believe "battleship" is synonymous with "[[warship]]", and thus we see strange classifications like "light battleship" or "small battleship". Usually, these futuristic battleships are large [[starship]]s operating in outer space, rather than the open ocean.

Like [[aircraft carriers in fiction|aircraft carriers]], conventional ocean-going battleships both fictional and real have also made frequent appearances in fictionalized accounts. Decommissioning of the [[USS Missouri]] was famously the centrepiece for the Steven Segal film [[Under Siege]], although filming actually took place on the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS Alabama]]. The mutiny on the Russian [[Battleship Potemkin]] was the inspiration for [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s [[The Battleship Potemkin|film of the same name]], a propaganda work celebrating the Russian Revolution which is, nonetheless, regarded as a masterpiece. [[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|The Battle of the River Plate]] [[1956]] is a more or less factual account of the defeat and scuttling of the [[Admiral Graf Spee]] near the start of [[World War II]]. The actions of British ships of the line in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] are the centrepiece of [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Hornblower]] series of novels. Even the sunken ''Yamato'' got a new lease on life when it was raised and refitted to go to the farthest reaches of space in [[Star Blazers]].
