'''Glenrothes''' is a town situated in the centre of [[Fife]], in east central [[Scotland]]. It is approximately equidistant between [[Edinburgh]] and [[Dundee]] and is the largest town in Fife,by area, covering 2,229&nbsp;hectares of land (5508&nbsp;acres).<ref>Fife Council (2006/07) ''Glenrothes Economic Profile'' [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_GlenrothesRevisedApr07.pdf]</ref> Glenrothes was the second [[New town#United Kingdom|new town]] to be designated in Scotland under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1946. It was established in 1948 and was created to attract new employment and population to mid-Fife with the creation of the Rothes Colliery, a major [[coal mine]]. The pit closed in 1961, only 4&nbsp;years into production because of unstemmable flooding problems and a decline in coal requirements nationwide. However other industries were attracted to the town and it became an economic growth point for central Scotland establishing itself as an important [[Silicon Glen]] centre. Today Glenrothes has a population of 38,927 people based on recent population projections,<ref>''Fife Council (2008) Population Estimates for Towns and Villages in Fife'' [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_Population06Leaflet.pdf] </ref> is the administrative centre for Fife and has been successful in attracting employment to Fife, in particular a high number of modern industrial companies.<ref>Fife Council (2006/07) ''Glenrothes Economic Profile'' [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_GlenrothesRevisedApr07.pdf]</ref> The town has well-tended parks and landscaping,<ref> Glenrothes Gazette article (September 2007),[http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/glenrothes-gazette-news/Town-beauty-praised.3218224.jp]</ref> a plethora of sculptures and artworks and one of Scotland's largest single level indoor shopping malls.<ref>Fife Council (2006) ''Glenrothes Town Centre Profile'' [http://www.fife.gov.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_GlenrothesTownCentreFS.pdf] </ref> The town also has a variety of religious and educational institutions and has good transport links with the rest of Scotland.<ref>Fife Council (2007) ''Central Fife Parliamentary Constituency Economic Profile''[http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_CentralFifePC-070906.pdf] </ref>

==History==
===Background===
[[Image:Woodside pre Glenrothes.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Housing at Woodside, built pre-Glenrothes]]
Glenrothes was designated in 1948 under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1946 as Scotland's second [[post-war]] new town. The original town plan was to build a new settlement for a population of 32,000-35,000 people. The land where Glenrothes now sits was largely agricultural and once contained a number of small rural communities. Originally the new town was going to be centred on [[Markinch]], however the village's infrastructure was deemed unable to withstand the substantial growth required to realise a new town. [[Leslie]] and [[Thornton]] were also considered but as a consequence an area of 5,370 acres (2,229 hectares) that sits between all of these villages was chosen. The land taken was previously an area of great natural beauty. The policies of Balbirnie House, Leslie House, Balgeddie House falling under the land ownerships of the Balfour, Rothes, Aytoun and Balgonie estates were all incorporated in the Glenrothes designated area.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes">{{cite book

The land was sub-divided into areas or "precincts" which were named after the [[Hamlet (place)| hamlets]] already established (e.g. Woodside, Cadham), the [[farms]] which once occupied the land (e.g. Rimbleton, Caskieberran, Collydean) or historical [[stately homes]] in the area (e.g. Balgeddie, [[Glenrothes#Pictures|Balbirnie]], Leslie Parks).<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

The name Rothes comes from the association with the north-east Scotland [[Earl of Rothes]], family name Leslie. The Leslie family owned much of the land historically. [[Glen]] (Scottish for valley) was added to prevent confusion with [[Rothes]] in [[Moray]], and because the town lies on the [[Leven, Fife|Leven]] valley.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /><ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997">{{cite book

The primary reason for the designation of Glenrothes was to house miners who where to work at a new super coal mine. This was to be the most modern of the day and was built west of Thornton, an established village south of Glenrothes. The Super Pit was named the Rothes Colliery and it was officially opened by the Queen in 1957. About 5,000 miners were to be required to produce 5,000&nbsp;tonnes of coal per day, and huge railway yards were established. The pit was to have a working life of 100&nbsp;years. The planned long-term benefits were to be huge, and the driver for economic regeneration for central Fife. At its peak the Rothes Colliery employed over 1,500 miners. In 1961, 4&nbsp;years after opening, the huge investment was written off and the mine closed as a result of un-stemmable flooding and geological problems. Ironically, miners who'd worked in older deep pits in the area had fore-warned against the development of the Rothes Pit for this very reason. The closure of the state-of-the art facility left the huge enclosed concrete wheel-towers standing at Thornton for many years as a forlorn symbol of what could have been.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /><ref> Glenrothes Gazette(2008) [http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/glenrothes-gazette-news/History-of-Glenrothes.3678393.jp Glenrothes History]''The Glenrothes Gazette'', 2009-01-20. Retrieved on [[January 24]], [[2008]]</ref>

Originally the main industry in the Glenrothes area was paper-making (Tullis-Russell and the other mills along the Leven Valley) and [[coal mining]]. Unlike [[East Kilbride]], [[Cumbernauld]] or [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] Glenrothes was not originally to be a Glasgow overspill new town, although it did later take this role. It was however populated in the early 1950s in large part by mining families moving from the West of [[Scotland]], particularly the [[Glasgow]] area, though many re-settled from the declining [[Lothian]] coalfields too.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /> 

[[Image:Glenrothes Offices.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Fife Council Chambers and HQ buildings, Glenrothes Town Centre]]
The pit's closure was devastating and further development of Glenrothes was almost stopped. The pit's closure did help change the fortunes of the town for the better. Central Government changed the town's role and appointed Glenrothes as one of the economic focal points for Central Scotland. The Glenrothes Development Corporation were successful in attracting a plethora of modern electronics factories to the town. The first big overseas electronic investor was Beckmans Industries in 1959 followed by Hughes Industries in early 1960s. A number of other important companies followed establishing Glenrothes as a major hub in Scotland's [[Silicon Glen]].<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /><ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

A further boost to the town during the 1970s saw it become the centre of Fife Council's operations.  This took the role from [[Cupar]] which was formally the County Town of Fife. Fife House (the headquarters of Fife Council) and other Fife Council buildings are situated in Glenrothes' town centre. [[Fife Constabulary]] and [[Scottish Enterprise]] Fife also have their headquarters in the town. Today Glenrothes is the administrative centre for Fife.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /><ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

===Glenrothes Development Corporation===

The planning, development, management and promotion of Glenrothes was the responsibility of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC), a [[quango]] appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. Fife Council were responsible for implementing the [[infrastructure]] in the town such as schools, parks and roads.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

The GDC was wound up in 1995, and was asked to undertake any last major works required in the town with the aid of a grant. The Leven Bridge crossing Riverside Park and the Kingdom Centre Phase 4, including the Rothes Halls were some of the last major projects undertaken. Property and assets of the town were either sold off to private companies or passed onto the responsibility of Fife Council. The winding up of the GDC meant that Glenrothes was no longer designated a new town. Development and management of the town would now be undertaken by Fife Council. The development corporation left its lasting legacy on the town by overseeing the development of 15,378 houses, 480,692 square metres of industrial floorspace, 68,328 square metres of office floorspace and 53,603 square metres of shopping floorspace by [[31 December]] [[1995]].<ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

===Glenrothes Today===

At the ripe old age of 60 Glenrothes is today considered a clean, generally well maintained and quietly successful modern town.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" /> <ref> Fegan, Bruce (2008) [http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2008/06/30/newsstory11578965t0.asp] ''TOWN SPARKLING ON DIAMOND DAY'', ''The Courier'' Retrieved on [[June 30]] [[2008]]</ref> While much of the townscape consists of unexceptional 20th century developments, Glenrothes has many surprises. Early residential areas of Glenrothes present some of the best examples of post war [[social housing]], two of which won [[Saltire Society]] Awards. Three of the towns earliest churches, St. Margaret's, St. Paul's and St. Columba's, are now [[listed buildings]].
[[Image:Balbirnie House.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Balbirnie House Hotel, Balbirnie Park, Glenrothes]]
The historical stately homes, Balbirnie House, Leslie House and Balgeddie House are all located in Glenrothes.<ref> Fife Council 2003, Glenrothes Local Plan Proposals Map [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_GlenrothesAreaLocalPlan-ProposalsMapSheetB.pdf]</ref> Balbirnie House, former home of the Balfour family, was occupied by the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) between 1981 until its wind up in 1996. The grounds of the mansion house were bought and developed in 1969 by the GDC to become Balbirnie Park and golf course. The former stable block of the house has been developed as the Balbirnie craft centre and Balbirnie House itself is now a luxury hotel. Balgeddie House, located in the northwest of the town, has also been converted into a high quality hotel.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /> 

Leslie House, former home of the Rothes family, was once an eventide home owned by the Church of Scotland and most recently is set to become luxury apartments.<ref> Leslie House Development Reference [http://www.sundialproperties.co.uk/current/index.php?ID=31]</ref> Much of the former grounds of Leslie House have been used to create Riverside Park.

Glenrothes was the first Scottish new town to appoint a town artist in 1968.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /> Today, as a result, there is a large variety of artworks and sculptures scattered throughout the town (around 132) made from a variety of materials such as bronze, fibre glass, bricks, sandstone and concrete. The sculptures range from [[Glenrothes#Pictures|giant flowers]], [[Glenrothes#Pictures|giant hands]], a dinosaur, toadstools, [[Glenrothes#Pictures|the Good Samaritan]], a horse & chariot, [[Glenrothes#Pictures|dancing children]], a seated old couple, crocodiles and marching Hippos.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

Landscaping in Glenrothes often leaves the impression that many of the housing areas have been built in parkland. The town has won the "Best Kept Town & Village Competition" in Fife for the second time as a result of the high standards of landscaping.<ref> Glenrothes Gazette article (September 2007),[http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/glenrothes-gazette-news/Town-beauty-praised.3218224.jp]</ref>
Housing has generally been built to high standards, especially when compared to other social housing areas in Scotland.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />
Glenrothes is undoubtably modern however old buildings still exist and have been carefully integrated into the modern fabric of the town. It has been described as leaving the impression of pleasant modernity.<ref> Undiscovered Scotland website, Glenrothes featurepage [http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/glenrothes/glenrothes/index.html]</ref>

Glenrothes serves a wider area as both a service, employment and retail centre. There are a number of attractive villages surrounding the town each unique in their own respect. The surrounding villages are [[Markinch]], [[Leslie, Fife|Leslie]], [[Thornton, Fife|Thornton]], [[Coaltown of Balgonie]], [[Star of Markinch]], [[Milton of Balgonie]] (with [[Balgonie Castle]]) and [[Kinglassie]]. Slightly further afield are [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], [[Freuchie]], [[Windygates]], [[Kennoway]], [[Muirhead]], [[Auchmuirbridge]] and [[Scotlandwell]].

==Geography==

Glenrothes lies in mid-Fife between the agricultural ''Howe of Fife'' in the north and east and Fife's industrial heartland in the south and west. It is located approximately equidistant between the cities of [[Edinburgh]] ({{convert|32|mi|km|0}}) and [[Dundee]] ({{convert|27|mi|km|0}}). Its OS Grid reference is NO281015.

The northern parts of the town lie upland on the southern fringes of the [[Lomond Hills|Lomond Hills Regional Park]]. The central parts of the town lie on land between the southern lip of the River Leven Valley, a green lung which passes east west through the town, and the Warout Ridge. Southern parts of Glenrothes are largely industrial and lie on land which gently slopes south towards the Lochty Burn and the village of Thornton.

Temperatures in Glenrothes, like the rest of Scotland, are relatively moderate given its northern latitude. Fife is a peninsula, located between the [[Firth of Tay]] in the north, the [[Firth of Forth]] in the south and the [[North Sea]] in the east. Summers are relatively cool and the warming of the water over the summer results in warm winters. Average annual temperatures in Glenrothes range from a max of 18°C to a min of 9°C.<ref> Weather.co.uk website ''Glenrothes Climate Stats''[http://uk.weather.com/weather/climatology/UKXX0775?from=smartlinks] </ref>

===Built environment===

Glenrothes' layout was based on an irregular grid. The first town masterplan set out self-contained residential precincts with their own primary schools, local shops and community facilities. Separating industry as far as possible from housing areas in planned industrial estates was a key element of the plan. This was a step change from the unplanned and polluted industrial towns and cities of the previous centuries where cramped housing and dirty industry were built in close proximity to one another. The idea for Glenrothes was to provide a clean and healthy environment for the town's residents regardless of their social background. "Through traffic" would bypass housing precincts by distributor roads which would connect each precinct to a purposely designed town centre and to the industrial estates. Another element that was adopted was the use of roundabouts at junctions instead of traffic lights allowing traffic to flow freely.

At first Glenrothes developed in a linear fashion starting at Woodside in the east and progressing westwards. Housing was a mixture of low-rise mixed housing and flats. The first masterplan was implemented as far as South Parks and Rimbleton housing precincts.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /> 

Early Glenrothes precincts, developed under the first masterplan, were based on [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] principles and this is reflected in their housing styles and layouts.

A second town masterplan was designed in the 1960s following Glenrothes' change of role and was to accommodate an increased population target of 50,000-70,000. New areas of land in the north and south of the designated area were brought into production for new development. The irregular grid layout was retained however housing precincts were to become less self-contained and would share local facilities in a new neighbourhood centre format. The road network was to be upgraded to deal with projected increases in car ownership. New housing estates were developed in the west, south and then northern parts of the town. The precincts of the 1960s and 70's, developed under the second masterplan, were based on principles of [[Radburn]], separating as far as possible footpaths from roads. The townscape changed with a mixture of higher densities and new architectural styles. 

Housing precincts from the 1980s onwards have largely been developed by the [[private sector]] and more reflect today's aspirations of low density [[suburban]] living.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" /> Most of this housing was developed in the northern parts of the town.

Large portions of land in the south of the town were developed for industrial purposes, largely as a result of the proximity to the proposed East Fife Regional Road (A92) which was developed in 1989 giving dual carriageway access to the main central Scotland road network. The second master plan was used until the wind-up of the Development Corporation in 1995.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

Glenrothes came late into high rise development and as a result it has only a single tower block, which is located adjacent to other tall buildings in the town centre. The townscape is largely low rise until the town centre is reached where flats and clusters of taller buildings have been used.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

===Housing Precincts===

The Housing precincts in Glenrothes are as follows; 
[[Image:The_Dream.JPG|thumb|left|200px|''The Dream'' sculpture, Auchmuty]]
'''Alburne Park''' is in east Glenrothes in close proximity to Markinch. It was built as the first private estate in the town and housed many of the senior GDC staff. Alburne Park is home to the Glenrothes Art Club and the Balbirnie Gym. The former Preston School (now demolished) was located at the southern entrance to the estate.

'''Auchmuty''' was the second precinct to be designed and built by the GDC in Glenrothes. It is located to the south and east of Glenrothes town centre. The precinct has its own schools and newsagents. It is well linked with Glenrothes town centre. St. Paul's church, and St Lukes Church are also located in the precinct and the Glenrothes war memorial sits agacent to the latter church. Warout stadium and park is located to the north of the precinct and is host to a number of outdoor events including the annual bonfire held in November and the Glenrothes Gala. 

Housing at '''Balbirnie''' and '''Prestonhall''' is located in the east and northeast of Glenrothes, adjacent to [[Markinch]]. Properties in both estates have been built by the private sector and are often associated with nearby Markinch rather than Glenrothes. Local children attend primary school in Markinch. An extension of the housing to the northeast of Balbirnie is currently underway and will see development of over 100 new homes. Land to the south of Prestonhall, on land formally occupied by a papermill, is also being developed for new housing. Balbirnie house hotel, craft centre, park and golf course are in close proximity to these housing areas. The remains of the Balbirnie Stone Circle lie at the northeast of the Balbirnie estate.
[[Image:The Secret Garden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Low rise private suburban housing, Balgeddie]]

'''Balfarg''' is located in the northeast of Glenrothes. There is a mix of private and public sector housing on the estate. Gilvenbank hotel is located to the north and Gilvenbank park to the west.

'''Bankhead''' is a private housing area, built in the 1990's, located in the south of Glenrothes. It lies adjacent to the Westwood Park employment area and is in close proximity to the village of Thornton. Local children are served by Thornton and Pitteuchar West Primary Schools. Stenton Pond lies a short distance to the west of the estate.

'''Cadham''' is located in the north of Glenrothes and was designed and built in the 1970's by the GDC. Cadham village, a former hamlet, is located to the southeast of the estate. This is now a [[conservation area]] and contains a number of pre-war houses, built for workers of nearby Tullis Russell papermill. 

Cadham is distinguishable by its unusual housing and layout. Housing has been clustered into horseshoe shaped staggered terraces with segregated footpaths and generous landscaped areas. Another distinguishing feature is that the housing has been designed with monopitched roofs and livingrooms are located on the first floor of properties in order to take advantage of the prominent views to the south. Cadham is served by a neighbourhood centre which contains a parade of shops, a pub, a church, offices and other community facilities. Glenrothes fire station sits adjacent to the Cadham Centre to the south. Local children attend nearby Pitcoudie Primary School.
[[Image:Dinosaur, Caskieberran.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Dinosaur'' Sculpture, Caskieberran]]

'''Caskieberran''' is located in west Glenrothes and was built in the 1960's and 1970's. It has its own Primary School, local shop and community hall. Much of the housing in Caskieberran was built by the GDC, with a small area of private housing built to the west, adjacent to Glenrothes Golf Course. Caskieberran contains a number of urban artworks including sculptures of a dinosaur, a giant cobra, hippos, a horse and chariot and toadstools. 

'''Collydean''' - Main article [[Collydean]]
[[Image:Collydean.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Compact housing and segregated pedestrian path, Collydean]]
'''Coul''' is a small private estate located on the northern boundary of Glenrothes. It sits in close proximity to the Coul Reservoir and the [[Lomond Hills]] Regional Park. The estate was built in the late 1990's and early part of the 2000's. Local children attend Collydean Primary School, a short distance to the south. Coul House, a [[georgian era| georgian]] property with steading lies to the east of the estate.
