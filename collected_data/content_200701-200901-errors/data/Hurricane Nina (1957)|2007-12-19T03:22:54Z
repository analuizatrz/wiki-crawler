{{dablink|This article is about the Central Pacific hurricane of 1957; for other storms of the same name, see [[Tropical Storm Nina]].}}

'''Hurricane Nina''' was the final tropical storm and hurricane of the [[1950-1969 Pacific hurricane seasons|1957 Pacific hurricane season]] and the last storm to form during the active Central Pacific hurricane season this year. This storm was named "Nina" because during this time, hurricanes in this basin were given names off of the typhoon naming lists. This storm was the last to form during a series of typhoons to form in the Pacific in November.<ref name="Central Pacific Season Summary 1957">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=1957 Central Pacific Hurricane Season Summary|accessdate=2007-03-08|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1957.php}}</ref>

Nina never made landfall while active, although some forecasts called for Nina to be the first hurricane to make landfall on [[Hawaii]], but the hurricane veered west before hitting land. However, it came close enough to Hawaii to cause light damage and prompt evacuations. Nina was the first hurricane to affect the island of [[Kauai]] at that intensity.<ref name="Syracuse Herald Journal 2">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1957|title=Hurricane Nina Dies In Pacific|publisher= Syracuse Herald Journal|accessdate=2007-03-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=22474857&firstvisit=true&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref> This storm was preceded by a winter storm that caused damaging surf along the north coast of Kauai and was both preceded and proceeded by cold fronts sweeping over Hawaii.<ref name="Central Pacific Season Summary 1957">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=1957 Central Pacific Hurricane Season Summary|accessdate=2007-03-08|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1957.php}}</ref>

==Storm history==
On [[November 29]], a disturbance in the [[ITCZ]] began gaining organization near [[Palmyra Island]], which the ITCZ had been near for a week prior. The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50 [[mph]] and a pressure of 1002.7 [[Bar (unit)|mbar]] and that during the night, the wind velocity peaked at 70 mph. Because of an irregular schedule for reporting, the last report received from the weather station, obtained eighteen hours earlier, had reported only small winds and 1004.7 mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour pressure tendency, which reported -3.2 mbar. Post-analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development.<ref name="Central Pacific Season Summary 1957">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=1957 Central Pacific Hurricane Season Summary|accessdate=2007-03-08|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1957.php}}</ref>

After receiving the second report on the 29th, warnings were immediately put out on the cyclone, which was given the name "Nina" from the typhoon list. For 24 hours, the center of the storm was reported to be stationary as the weather on Palmyra was continuously abnormal, but the next day, an aircraft from the [[Air Force]] showed that the storm was 500 miles north of the island and that it had intensified to hurricane strength.<ref name="Central Pacific Season Summary 1957">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=1957 Central Pacific Hurricane Season Summary|accessdate=2007-03-08|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1957.php}}</ref> After six more hours, Nina's forward speed had quickly slowed 16 mph while the storm began a northward track, heading towards [[Kauai]], but before reaching the island, the storm turned first to the north-northwest on [[December 2]] and then sharply to the west later that day.

On [[December 4]], Nina had reached its peak intensity of 85 mph. At this time, a polar high pressure system moved off of the coast of [[Japan]]. The system reached Nina on [[December 6]] and forced the hurricane into a southward path. Twenty hours after the turn, the cold air from the system got trapped inside the circulation of Nina and caused the storm to rapidly dissipate. The last advisory on the system was issued early on [[December 7]] while Nina was at depression strength south of [[Midway Atoll]].<ref name="Weather and Circulation">{{cite web|author=Carlos R.

==Preparations==
Despite never moving onto land, Nina's proximity to [[Hawaii]] and the forecasts for an imminent landfall resulted in massive evacuations. An estimated 300 people living in [[Hanapepe]] and [[Hanalei]] were forced to evacuate when the [[Hanalei River]] overflowed its banks.<ref name="Hayward Daily Review">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1957|title=Nina Lashes Hawaii With Winds, Rains|publisher=Daily Review|accessdate=2007-03-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=47287819&firstvisit=true&currentResult=6&currentPage=10}}</ref> An estimated 1,500 people on [[Kauai]] were evacuated to higher ground, where the [[Red Cross]] had established seven evacuation centers for these people to evacuate to.<ref name="Syracuse Herald Journal 2">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1957|title=Hurricane Nina Dies In Pacific|publisher= Syracuse Herald Journal|accessdate=2007-03-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=22474857&firstvisit=true&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref> In addition, thirteen members of the [[United States Coast Guard]] were evacuated from low-lying islands and harbors when they were threatened by rising tides triggered by the hurricane and the threat of flooding forced 420 military personnel and families in [[Waikiki]]'s Ft. Derussy and Ft. Armstrong as well as those living in Ft. Kamehameha, near [[Pearl Harbor]] to leave for higher ground. 270 were housed in Tripler Army Hospital and a temporary shelter was opened in Ft. Shafter, both of which were on high ground.<ref name="Galveston Daily News">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1957|title=Hurricane Nina Headed Toward Hawaiian Islands|publisher=Galveston Daily News|accessdate=2007-03-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=46024088&firstvisit=true&currentResult=2&currentPage=0}}</ref> In anticipation of Nina, 85 planes were flown away from Barber's Point Naval Air Base to [[Midway Atoll|Midway]]<ref name="Charleston Gazette">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1957|title=Wind, Rain Warn Hawaii of Hurricane|publisher=Charleston Gazette|accessdate=2007-03-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=40657810&firstvisit=true&currentResult=6&currentPage=20}}</ref> and several commercial flights were cancelled until the storm had passed. There was also concern for the residents of the privately owned [[Niihau]], the closest landmass to the center of Nina and 20 miles closer than Kauai. The island's only communications was by boat and most attempts at reaching the island failed due to high surf.<ref name="Syracuse Herald Journal 2">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1957|title=Hurricane Nina Dies In Pacific|publisher= Syracuse Herald Journal|accessdate=2007-03-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=22474857&firstvisit=true&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref>

==Impact==
Despite the evacuations, Nina's closest approach to Hawaii was 120 miles away.<ref name="Central Pacific Season Summary 1957">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=1957 Central Pacific Hurricane Season Summary|accessdate=2007-03-08|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1957.php}}</ref> However, it came close enough to bring winds and heavy rain to the islands. There were four deaths reported in connection to the storm. The first reported was on [[Oahu]] when Herman Palepana, a [[lineman]] in the [[Honolulu]] street department, got killed when he was electrocuted by a [[electric power transmission|power line]] downed during Nina's passing.<ref name="Hayward Daily Review">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1957|title=The Daily Review of December 2|accessdate=2007-03-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=47287819&firstvisit=true&currentResult=6&currentPage=10}}</ref> Soon after, a [[sampan]] called the ''Setsu Maru'' sent a distress call reporting that the boat was sinking 10 miles east of Niihau.<ref name="The Gleaner">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1957|title=Hurricane 'Nina' Rips Hawaii; Sweeps North|publisher=The Gleaner|accessdate=2007-03-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=47531790&firstvisit=true&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref> Even though the Navy sent the submarine rescue vessel ''Couchal'' and conducted an air-seas search for the vessel, no trace of the sampan or the wreckage had been found.

=== Records and naming ===
While Nina was near [[Honolulu]], it caused unusually high winds. When wind gusts of 82 mph were recorded at Honolulu airport during the storm, it set the record for highest wind gust ever recorded in that city.<ref name="Central Pacific Season Summary 1957">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=1957 Central Pacific Hurricane Season Summary|accessdate=2007-03-08|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1957.php}}</ref> This was the first and last time a Central Pacific hurricane was named "Nina". The name was not retired, but because of the use of a current naming list using the [[Hawaiian language]], the name "Nina" will likely not be used again.
