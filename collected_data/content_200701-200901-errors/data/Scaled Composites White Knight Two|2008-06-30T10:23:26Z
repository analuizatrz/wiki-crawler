[[Scaled Composites]]' '''Model 348 White Knight Two''' is the first stage of [[Tier 1b]], a two-stage to suborbital-space manned launch system. It is coupled with [[SpaceShipTwo]] to form the full launch package. WK2 is based on the [[Scaled Composites White Knight|successful mothership]] to [[SpaceShipOne]], which itself is based on [[Scaled Composites Proteus|Proteus]]. 

Virgin Galactic has two WK2's on order.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/news/080123-virgingalactic-ss2-design.html |title=Virgin Galactic Unveils Suborbital Spaceliner Design |accessdate=2008-01-25 |date=[[2008-01-23]] |first=Tariq |last=Malik |publisher=''SPACE.com''}}</ref>  Together WK2 and SS2 form the basis for [[Virgin Galactic]]'s fleet of suborbital spaceplanes.

The first two WK2s will be named after [[Steve Fossett]], a close friend of [[Richard Branson]], and Richard's mother Eve:

==Design==
White Knight Two will be roughly three times larger than [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]], in order to perform a [[captive carry]] with the larger [[SpaceShipTwo]] spacecraft. The WK2 will be similar in [[wingspan]] to a [[B-29 Superfortress|B29 bomber]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/943/1 |title=Something dangerous and new |accessdate=2007-08-28 |date=August 28 2007 |publisher=thespacereview.com}}</ref> and will be by far the largest aircraft constructed by Scaled Composites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2006/03/07/205290/ss2-white-knight-2-to-use-common-fuselage.html |title=SS2, White Knight 2 to use common fuselage |accessdate=2007-08-25 |date=March 7 2006 |publisher=flightglobal }}</ref> It is also the largest all composite aircraft ever built.

WK2 will be an [[aerobatic]] aircraft, and will provide preview flights offering several seconds of [[weightlessness]], before the actual suborbital event. It will have a [[service ceiling]] of about 60,000 ft or 18km, offering a dark blue sky to passengers. This would allow tourists to practice before the real flight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/news/060811_rutan_interview.html |title=Burt Rutan on Civilian Spaceflight, Breakthroughs, and Inside SpaceShipTwo |accessdate=2007-08-25 |date=11 August 2006 |author=Leonard David |publisher=Space.com }}</ref>

White Knight Two will have a [[twin boom]] with two [[jet engine]]s per hull.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kenny Kemp |title=Destination Space |year=March 2007 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] }}</ref> One hull will be an exact replica of that of SpaceShipTwo (to allow tourist training), and the other will carry cut-rate day-trippers into the stratosphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/space/magazine/15-06/ff_space_virgin |title=Burt Rutan and Richard Branson Want You to Hit Space in High Style |accessdate=2007-08-25 |date=May 22, 2007 |author= Spencer Reiss |publisher=Wired.com }}</ref>

The design is quite different from the White Knight, both in size, use of tail, engine configuration and placement of cockpit(s). The White Knight uses two T-tails, but the White Knight 2 uses two cruciform tails. Engine configuration
is also very different, with engines hung underneath the wings on the White Knight 2 and 
engines on either side of the sole cockpit on the White Knight.

=== Historical similarity of design ===
It has been suggested that the final design of [[Scaled Composites]] ''White Knight Two'' resembles a [[1979]] [[Soviet Union | Soviet]] spacecraft designated ''3M-2''. A twin-boom, four engined aircraft would have carried a spaceplane under its middle wing and released it at high altitude. The design was developed by the Soviet [[Myasishchev | Myasishchev Experimental Design Bureau]] around 1979. The carrier aircraft would have been based on the Soviet [[Myasishchev M-4 | 3M bomber]], and like White Knight Two it could have been used in other ways, not just for carrying the spacecraft. However, at an engineering level the resemblance between the two craft is not strong and may simply be a case of similar requirements leading to similar designs. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/blogs/2008/01/25/space-ship-two-eerily-familiar%e2%80%a6/ |title=Space Ship Two: Eerily Familiarâ€¦ |accessdate=2008-01-26 |date=2008-01-25 |author=Dave Brody |publisher=Live Science }}</ref>

==Commercial introduction==
The White Knight Two design was revealed on [[January 23]], [[2008]]. Completion and rollout of the first aircraft is scheduled for late [[July 2008]] with flight tests set to begin in early [[September 2008]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/080606-virgin-mother.html |title=Virgin Galactic Spaceline: Mega-Mothership Set for Rollout Debut |accessdate=2008-06-10 |date=June 6, 2008 |author=Leonard David |publisher=SPACE.com}}</ref>

The launch customer of White Knight Two is [[Virgin Galactic]], which will have the first two units, and exclusive rights to the craft for the first few years.
