<!--Para1: Definition, symptoms and diagnosis-->

'''Schizophrenia''' ({{pron-en|ˌskɪtsəˈfriːniə}}), from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] ''schizein'' (σχίζειν, "to split") and ''phrēn'', ''phren-'' (φρήν, φρεν-, "[[mind]]") is a [[psychiatric]] [[diagnosis]] that describes a [[mental disorder]] characterized by abnormalities in the [[perception]] or expression of [[reality]]. It most commonly manifests as auditory [[hallucination]]s, [[paranoia|paranoid]] or bizarre [[delusion]]s or [[thought disorder|disorganized speech and thinking]] in the context of significant social or occupational dysfunction. Onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood,<ref name="castle1991">{{cite journal |author=Castle D, Wesseley S, Der G, Murray RM |year=1991|title=The incidence of operationally defined schizophrenia in Camberwell 1965–84 |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=159 |pages=790–794 |pmid=1790446 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/159/6/790 |accessdate=2008-07-05 |doi=10.1192/bjp.159.6.790 |doi_brokendate=2008-07-05}}</ref> with approximately 0.4–0.6%<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhugra D |url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020151 |year=2006 |title=The global prevalence of schizophrenia |journal=[[Public Library of Science|PLoS Medicine]] |volume=2 | issue=5 |pages=372–373 |pmid=15916460 |accessdate= 2008-02-24 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020151}}</ref><ref name="fn_34">{{cite journal |author=Goldner EM, Hsu L, Waraich P, Somers JM |year=2002 |title=Prevalence and incidence studies of schizophrenic disorders: a systematic review of the literature |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=47 | issue=9 |pages=833–43 |pmid=12500753 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/publications/archives/CJP/2002/November/goldner.asp |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> of the population affected. Diagnosis is based on the patient's self-reported experiences and observed behavior. No laboratory test for schizophrenia currently exists.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" />

<!--Para2:lack of validity/controversies-->
Studies suggest that [[genetics]], early environment, [[neurobiology]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and social processes are important contributory factors; some recreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms. Current psychiatric research is focused on the role of neurobiology, but no single organic cause has been found. Due to the many possible combinations of symptoms, there is debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes. For this reason, [[Eugen Bleuler]] termed the disease ''the schizophrenias'' (plural) when he coined the name. Despite its [[etymology]], schizophrenia is not synonymous with [[dissociative identity disorder]], previously known as multiple personality disorder or split personality; in [[popular culture]] the two are often confused.

<!--Para3: Dopamine hypothesis and treatment-->
Increased [[dopamine|dopaminergic activity]] in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain is consistently found in schizophrenic individuals. The mainstay of treatment is pharmacotherapy with [[antipsychotic]] medications; these primarily work by suppressing dopamine activity. Dosages of antipsychotics are generally lower than in the early decades of their use. Psychotherapy, vocational and social rehabilitation are also important. In more serious cases—where there is risk to self and others—involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, though hospital stays are less frequent and for shorter periods than they were in previous years.<ref name="BeckerKilian2006">{{cite journal |author=Becker T, Kilian R|year=2006 |title=Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Supplement |volume=429 |pages=9–16 |pmid=16445476 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x}}</ref>

<!--Para4: Impairment/chronicity and Comorbidity-->
The disorder is primarily thought to affect [[cognition]], but it also usually contributes to chronic problems with [[human behavior|behavior]] and [[emotion]]. People diagnosed with schizophrenia are likely to be diagnosed with [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] conditions, including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] and [[anxiety disorders]];<ref name="Sim_et_al_2006">{{cite journal |author=Sim K, Chua TH, Chan YH, Mahendran R, Chong SA |title=Psychiatric comorbidity in first episode schizophrenia: a 2 year, longitudinal outcome study |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |volume=40 |issue=7 |pages=656–63 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16904688 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.06.008|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-3956(06)00122-1 |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> the lifetime [[prevalence]] of [[substance abuse]] is typically around 40%. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness, are common and [[life expectancy]] is decreased; the average life expectancy of people with the disorder is 10 to 12 years less than those without, owing to increased physical health problems and a higher [[suicide]] rate than the general population.<ref name="Brown_Barraclough_2000">{{cite journal |author=Brown S, Barraclough B,  Inskip H|year=2000 |title=Causes of the excess mortality of schizophrenia |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=177 |pages=212–7 |pmid=11040880 |doi=10.1192/bjp.177.3.212}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may demonstrate [[Thought disorder|disorganized and unusual thinking]] and speech, auditory [[hallucination]]s, and [[delusion]]s. Social isolation commonly occurs for a variety of reasons. Impairment in [[social cognition]] is associated with schizophrenia, as are symptoms of paranoia from delusions and hallucinations, and the negative symptoms of apathy and [[avolition]]. In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation; these are signs of [[catatonia]]. No one sign is diagnostic of schizophrenia, and all can occur in other medical and psychiatric conditions.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" /> The current classification of psychoses holds that symptoms need to have been present for at least one month in a period of at least six months of disturbed functioning. A schizophrenia-like psychosis of shorter duration is termed a [[schizophreniform disorder]].<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">{{cite book |author= |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |chapter=Schizophrenia |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/schiz.htm |isbn=0-89042-024-6 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak years for the onset of schizophrenia. These are critical periods in a young adult's social and vocational development, and they can be severely disrupted. To minimize the effect of schizophrenia, much work has recently been done to identify and treat the [[prodrome|prodromal (pre-onset)]] phase of the illness, which has been detected up to 30 months before the onset of symptoms, but may be present longer.<ref name="Addington_et_al_2007">{{cite journal |author=Addington J |coauthors=Cadenhead KS, Cannon TD, Cornblatt B, McGlashan TH, Perkins DO, Seidman LJ, Tsuang M, Walker EF, Woods SW, Heinssen R |year=2007|title=North American prodrome longitudinal study: a collaborative multisite approach to prodromal schizophrenia research |journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] |volume=33 | issue=3 |pages=665–72 |pmid=17255119|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbl075}}</ref> Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience the non-specific symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability and [[dysphoria]] in the prodromal period,<ref name="ParnasJorgensen1989">{{cite journal |author=Parnas J |coauthors=Jorgensen A |year=1989 |title=Pre-morbid psychopathology in schizophrenia spectrum |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=115 |pages=623–7 |pmid=2611591}}</ref> and transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms in the prodromal phase before psychosis becomes apparent.<ref name="Amminger_et_al_2006">{{cite journal |author=Amminger GP |coauthors=Leicester S, Yung AR, Phillips LJ, Berger GE, Francey SM, Yuen HP, McGorry PD |year=2006 |title=Early-onset of symptoms predicts conversion to non-affective psychosis in ultra-high risk individuals |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=84 | issue=1 |pages=67–76 |pmid=16677803 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2006.02.018}}</ref>

===Schneiderian classification===
The psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] (1887–1967) listed the forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called ''first-rank symptoms'' or [[Kurt Schneider#First-rank symptoms|Schneider's first-rank symptoms]], and they include delusions of being controlled by an external force; the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind; the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people; and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hallucinated voices.<ref name="SchneiderClinicalPsychopathology">Schneider, K. (1959) ''Clinical Psychopathology''. New York: Grune and Stratton.</ref> The reliability of first-rank symptoms has been questioned,<ref name="fn_4">{{cite journal |author=Bertelsen, A |year=2002 |title=Schizophrenia and Related Disorders: Experience with Current Diagnostic Systems |journal=Psychopathology |volume=35 |pages=89–93 |pmid=12145490 |doi=10.1159/000065125}}</ref> although they have contributed to the current diagnostic criteria.

===Positive and negative symptoms===
Schizophrenia is often described in terms of ''positive'' (or productive) and ''negative'' (or deficit) symptoms.<ref name="Sims_2002">{{cite book |author=Sims A |title=Symptoms in the mind: an introduction to descriptive psychopathology |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |isbn=0-7020-2627-1 |accessdate=}}</ref> Positive symptoms include [[delusion]]s, [[hallucination|auditory hallucinations]], and [[thought disorder]], and are typically regarded as manifestations of [[psychosis]]. Negative symptoms are so-named because they are considered to be the loss or absence of normal traits or abilities, and include features such as flat or [[blunted affect]] and [[emotion]], poverty of [[Speech communication|speech]] ([[alogia]]), inability to experience pleasure ([[anhedonia]]), and lack of [[motivation]] ([[avolition]]). Despite the appearance of blunted affect, recent studies indicate that there is often a normal or even heightened level of emotionality in schizophrenia, especially in response to stressful or negative events.<ref name="schizophrenia1">{{cite journal |author=Cohen & Docherty |year=2004 |title=Affective reactivity of speech and emotional experience in patients with schizophrenia |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=69 | issue=1 |pages=7–14 |pmid=15145465 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(03)00069-0}}</ref> A third symptom grouping, the ''disorganization syndrome'', is commonly described, and includes chaotic speech, thought, and behavior. There is evidence for a number of other symptom classifications.<ref name="Peralta_Cuesta_2001">{{cite journal |author=Peralta V |coauthors=Cuesta MJ |year=2001 |title=How many and which are the psychopathological dimensions in schizophrenia?

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of the person, and possibly abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends or co-workers, followed by a clinical assessment by a [[psychiatrist]], [[social worker]], [[clinical psychologist]] or other [[mental health professional]]. Psychiatric assessment typically involves some form of [[mental status examination]] and taking a [[psychiatric history]]. There are standardized criteria for the diagnosis, depending on the presence, severity and duration of certain signs and symptoms.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" /> There are several psychiatric illnesses other than schizophrenia that may present with psychotic symptoms. These include [[bipolar disorder]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pope HG |year=1983 |title=Distinguishing bipolar disorder from schizophrenia in clinical practice: guidelines and case reports |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |volume=34 |pages=322–328 |url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/34/4/322.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate= 2008-02-24}}</ref> [[borderline personality disorder]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=McGlashan TH |title=Testing DSM-III symptom criteria for schizotypal and borderline personality disorders |journal=[[Archives of General Psychiatry]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |year=1987 |month=February |pmid=3813809 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> [[schizoaffective disorder]], drug intoxication, brief drug-induced psychosis, and [[schizophreniform disorder]].

Assessment sometimes includes general medical and neurological examinations to exclude medical illnesses which may rarely present with psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms,<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" /> such as [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic disturbance]], [[systemic infection]], [[syphilis]], [[HIV]] infection, [[epilepsy]], and brain lesions. It may be necessary to rule out a [[delirium]], which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating [[level of consciousness]], and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication or possible [[adverse effects]] from [[antipsychotic medication]].

The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia are from the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], the current version being DSM-IV-TR, and the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization's]] [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], currently the ICD-10. The latter criteria are typically used in European countries while the DSM criteria are used in the USA or the rest of the world, as well as prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian [[Kurt Schneider#First rank symptoms|first rank symptoms]] although, in practice, agreement between the two systems is high.<ref name="Jakobsen_et_al_2005">{{cite journal |author=Jakobsen KD |coauthors=Frederiksen JN, Hansen T, Jansson LB, Parnas J, Werge T |year=2005 |title=Reliability of clinical ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnoses |journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 | issue=3 |pages=209–12 |pmid=16195122 | doi = 10.1080/08039480510027698}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] has developed the tool ''[[SCAN]] (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry)'' which can be used for diagnosing a number of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia.

===DSM IV-TR Criteria===
To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a person must display:<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" />
* '''Characteristic symptoms''': Two or more of the following, each present for much of the time during a one-month period (or less, if symptoms remitted with treatment)
** [[delusion]]s
** [[hallucination]]s
** disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence; speaking in [[abstraction|abstracts]]). See [[thought disorder]].
** grossly disorganized behavior (e.g. dressing inappropriately, crying frequently) or [[Catatonia|catatonic]] behavior
** negative symptoms, i.e., [[affective flattening]] (lack or decline in emotional response), [[alogia]] (lack or decline in speech), or [[avolition]] (lack or decline in motivation).

:Note: If delusions are judged to be bizarre, or hallucinations consist of hearing one voice participating in a running commentary of the patient's actions or of hearing two or more voices conversing with each other, only that symptom is required above. The speech disorganization criterion is only met if it is severe enough to substantially impair communication.
* '''Social/occupational dysfunction''': For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset. 
* '''Duration''': Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months. This six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less, if symptoms remitted with treatment).

Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of [[mood disorder]] or [[pervasive developmental disorder]] are present, or the symptoms are the direct result of a general medical condition or a substance, such as abuse of a drug or medication.

===Subtypes===
Historically, schizophrenia in the [[Western world|West]] was classified into simple, [[catatonia|catatonic]], hebephrenic (now known as [[Disorganized schizophrenia|disorganized]]), and paranoid. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] contains five sub-classifications of schizophrenia:
* [[Paranoia#Use in psychiatry|'''paranoid type''']]: where delusions and hallucinations are present but thought disorder, disorganized behavior, and affective flattening are absent (DSM code 295.3/ICD code F20.0)
* [[Disorganized schizophrenia|'''disorganized type''']]: named 'hebephrenic schizophrenia' in the ICD. Where thought disorder and flat affect are present together (DSM code 295.1/ICD code F20.1)
* [[catatonia|'''catatonic type''']]: prominent psychomotor disturbances are evident. Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and [[waxy flexibility]] (DSM code 295.2/ICD code F20.2)
* '''undifferentiated type''': psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met (DSM code 295.9/ICD code F20.3)
* '''residual type''': where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only (DSM code 295.6/ICD code F20.5)

The ICD-10 recognises a further two subtypes:
* '''post-schizophrenic depression''': a depressive episode arising in the aftermath of a schizophrenic illness where some low-level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present (ICD code F20.4)
* '''simple schizophrenia''': insidious but progressive development of prominent negative symptoms with no history of psychotic episodes (ICD code F20.6)

===Diagnostic issues and controversies===
Schizophrenia as a diagnostic entity has been criticised as lacking in scientific validity or reliability,<ref name="Bentall1992">{{cite book |author=Bentall, Richard P. |title=Reconstructing schizophrenia |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-415-07524-6 }}</ref><ref name="Boyle2002">{{cite book |author=Boyle, Mary |title=Schizophrenia: a scientific delusion? |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-22718-6}}</ref> part of a larger [[Biopsychiatry controversy|criticism]] of the validity of psychiatric diagnoses in general. One alternative suggests that the issues with the diagnosis would be better addressed as individual dimensions along which everyone varies, such that there is a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum]] or continuum rather than a cut-off between normal and ill. This approach appears consistent with research on [[schizotypy]] and of a relatively high prevalence of psychotic experiences<ref name="fn_5">{{cite journal |author=Verdoux H |coauthors=van Os J |year=2002 |title=Psychotic symptoms in non-clinical populations and the continuum of psychosis |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=54 | issue=1-2 |pages=59–65 |pmid=11853979 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(01)00352-8}}</ref><ref name="fn_65">{{cite journal |author=Johns LC |coauthors=van Os J |year=2001 |title=The continuity of psychotic experiences in the general population |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=21 | issue=8 |pages=1125–41 |pmid=11702510 |doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(01)00103-9}}</ref> and often non-distressing delusional beliefs<ref name="fn_67">{{cite journal |author=Peters ER |coauthors=Day S, McKenna J, Orbach G |year=2005 |title=Measuring delusional ideation: the 21-item Peters et al. Delusions Inventory (PDI) |journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] |volume=30 |pages=1005–22 |pmid=15954204}}</ref> amongst the general public.

Another criticism is that the definitions used for criteria lack consistency;<ref name="David1999">{{cite journal |author=David AS |year=1999 |title=On the impossibility of defining delusions |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 | issue=1 |pages=17–20 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/v006/6.1david.html |accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> this is particularly relevant to the evaluation of [[delusion#Diagnostic issues and controversies|delusions]] and [[thought disorder#Diagnostic issues and controversies|thought disorder]]. More recently, it has been argued that psychotic symptoms are not a good basis for making a diagnosis of schizophrenia as "psychosis is the 'fever' of mental illness—a serious but nonspecific indicator".<ref name="fn_6">{{cite journal |author=Tsuang MT |coauthors=Stone WS, Faraone SV |year=2000 |title=Toward reformulating the diagnosis of schizophrenia |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=157 | issue=7 |pages=1041–1050 |pmid=10873908 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.7.1041}}</ref>

Perhaps because of these factors, studies examining the [[diagnosis]] of schizophrenia have typically shown relatively low or inconsistent levels of diagnostic reliability. Most famously, [[David Rosenhan|David Rosenhan's]] 1972 study, published as ''[[Rosenhan experiment|On being sane in insane places]]'', demonstrated that the diagnosis of schizophrenia was (at least at the time) often subjective and unreliable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosenhan D |year=1973 |title=On being sane in insane places |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=179 |pages=250–8 |pmid=4683124 |doi=10.1126/science.179.4070.250}}</ref> More recent studies have found agreement between any two psychiatrists when diagnosing schizophrenia tends to reach about 65% at best.<ref name="fn_7">{{cite journal |author=McGorry PD |coauthors=Mihalopoulos C, Henry L, Dakis J, Jackson HJ, Flaum M, Harrigan S, McKenzie D, Kulkarni J, Karoly R |year=1995 |title=Spurious precision: procedural validity of diagnostic assessment in psychotic disorders |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=220–3 |pmid=7840355}}</ref> This, and the results of earlier studies of diagnostic reliability (which typically reported even lower levels of agreement) have led some critics to argue that the diagnosis of schizophrenia should be abandoned.<ref name="fn_8">{{cite book |author=Bentall, Richard P.; Read, John E; Mosher, Loren R. |title=Models of Madness: Psychological, Social and Biological Approaches to Schizophrenia |publisher=Brunner-Routledge |location=Philadelphia |year=2004|isbn=1-58391-906-6}}</ref>

In 2004 in Japan, the Japanese term for schizophrenia was changed from ''Seishin-Bunretsu-Byo'' (mind-split-disease) to ''Tōgō-shitchō-shō'' ([[integration disorder]]).<ref name="Sato">{{cite journal |author=Sato M |year=2004 |title=Renaming schizophrenia: a Japanese perspective |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=5 | issue=1 |pages=53–5 |pmid=16757998}}</ref> In 2006, campaigners in the UK, under the banner of Campaign for Abolition of the Schizophrenia Label, argued for a similar rejection of the diagnosis of schizophrenia and a different approach to the treatment and understanding of the symptoms currently associated with it.<ref name="schizophrenia_invalid">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6033013.stm Schizophrenia term use 'invalid'.] BBC News Online, ([[9 October]] [[2006]]). Retrieved on [[2007-05-16]]. </ref>

Alternatively, other proponents have put forward using the presence of specific [[neurocognitive deficit]]s to make a diagnosis. These take the form of a reduction or impairment in basic psychological functions such as [[memory]], [[attention]], [[executive function]] and [[problem solving]]. It is these sorts of difficulties, rather than the psychotic symptoms (which can in many cases be controlled by [[antipsychotic]] medication), which seem to be the cause of most [[disability]] in schizophrenia. However, this argument is relatively new and it is unlikely that the method of diagnosing schizophrenia will change radically in the near future.<ref name="GreenSchizophreniaBook">{{cite book |author=Green, Michael |title=Schizophrenia revealed: from neurons to social interactions |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=2001|isbn=0-393-70334-7}}</ref>

The diagnosis of schizophrenia has been used for political rather than therapeutic purposes; in the [[Soviet Union]] an additional sub-classification of [[sluggishly progressing schizophrenia]] was created. Particularly in the [[Russian SFSR|RSFSR]] (Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic), this diagnosis was used for the purpose of silencing political dissidents or forcing them to recant their ideas by the use of forcible confinement and treatment.<ref name="Wilkinson1986">{{cite journal |author=Wilkinson G |year=1986 |title=Political dissent and "sluggish" schizophrenia in the Soviet Union |journal=[[British Medical Journal|Br Med J (Clin Res Ed)]] |volume=293 | issue=6548 |pages=641–2 |pmid=3092963}}</ref> In 2000 there were similar concerns regarding [[Persecution of Falun Gong#Use of psychiatry and claims of abuse|detention and 'treatment']] of practitioners of the [[Falun Gong]] movement by the Chinese government.

==Epidemiology==
Schizophrenia occurs equally in males and females although typically appears earlier in men with the peak ages of onset being 20–28 years for males and 26–32 years for females.<ref name="castle1991" /> Much rarer are instances of childhood-onset<ref name="Kumra_et_al_2001">{{cite journal |author=Kumra S |coauthors=Shaw M, Merka P, Nakayama E, Augustin R |year=2001 |title=Childhood-onset schizophrenia: research update |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=46 | issue=10 |pages=923–30 |pmid=11816313}}</ref> and late- (middle age) or very-late-onset (old age) schizophrenia.<ref name="Howard_2005">Hassett A, Ames D, Chiu E (eds) (2005) Psychosis in the Elderly.

===Prenatal===
It is thought that causal factors can initially come together in early [[neurodevelopment]], including during pregnancy, to increase the risk of later developing schizophrenia.

===Drugs===
{{Seealso|Dual diagnosis}}
Although about half of all patients with schizophrenia abuse drugs or alcohol, a clear causal connection between drug use and schizophrenia has been difficult to distinguish. The two most often used explanations for this are "substance use causes schizophrenia" and "substance use is a consequence of schizophrenia", and they both may be correct. A relatively strong evidence based on multiple studies suggests that cannabis may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the role alcohol or other drugs. On the other hand, it has also been documented that schizophrenia patients use drugs to alleviate depression, anxiety and loneliness resulting from their disorder. <ref name="Gregg_et_al_2007">{{cite journal |author=Gregg L |coauthors=Barrowclough C, Haddock G |year=2007 |title=Reasons for increased substance use in psychosis |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=494–510 |pmid=17240501 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2006.09.004 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

===Psychological===
A number of psychological mechanisms have been implicated in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia. [[Cognitive bias]]es that have been identified in those with a diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations, include excessive attention to potential threats, jumping to conclusions, making external [[Attribution (psychology)|attributions]], impaired reasoning about social situations and [[Theory of mind|mental states]], difficulty distinguishing inner speech from speech from an external source, and difficulties with early visual processing and maintaining concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Broome MR |coauthors=Woolley JB, Tabraham P, Johns LC, Bramon E, Murray GK, Pariante C, McGuire PK, Murray RM |year=2005 |title=What causes the onset of psychosis?

Particular focus has been placed upon the function of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that a drug group which blocks dopamine function, known as the [[phenothiazines]], could reduce psychotic symptoms.

{{main|Treatment of schizophrenia}}
[[Image:Chlorpromazine-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Molecule of [[chlorpromazine]], which revolutionized treatment of schizophrenia in the 1950s.]]
The concept of a cure as such remains controversial, as there is no consensus on the definition, although some criteria for the remission of symptoms have recently been suggested.<ref name="fn_63">van Os J, Burns T, Cavallaro R, ''et al'' (2006).

Hospitalization may occur with severe episodes of schizophrenia. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to [[deinstitutionalization]], although can still occur.<ref name="BeckerKilian2006" /> Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or [[Assertive Community Treatment]] team, supported employment<ref>McGurk, SR, Mueser KT, Feldman K, Wolfe R, Pascaris A (2007).

In many non-Western societies, schizophrenia may only be treated with more informal, community-led methods.

===Medication===
The mainstay of psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is an [[antipsychotic]] (aka "[[neuroleptic]]") medication.<ref name="fn_72">{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg001fullguideline.pdf |format=PDF|title=Schizophrenia: Full national clinical guideline on core interventions in primary and secondary care |accessdate=2008-07-04 |author=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health |date=2006-01-24 |publisher=Gaskell and the British Psychological Society}}</ref> These can reduce the "positive" symptoms of psychosis. Most antipsychotics take around 7–14 days to have their main effect.
[[Image:Risperdal tablets.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Risperidone]] (trade name Risperdal) is a common [[atypical antipsychotic]] medication.]]
Though expensive, the newer [[atypical antipsychotic]] drugs are usually preferred for [[first-line treatment|initial treatment]] over the older [[typical antipsychotic]]s; they are often better tolerated and associated with lower rates of [[tardive dyskinesia]], although they are more likely to induce weight gain and [[obesity]]-related diseases.<ref name="fn_62">{{cite journal |author=Lieberman JA, Stroup TS, McEvoy JP, ''et al'' |title=Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in patients with chronic schizophrenia |journal=N.

The two classes of antipsychotics are generally thought equally effective for the treatment of the positive symptoms. Some researchers have suggested that the atypicals offer additional benefit for the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, although the clinical significance of these effects has yet to be established. Recent reviews have refuted the claim that atypical antipsychotics have fewer extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics, especially when the latter are used in low doses or when low potency antipsychotics are chosen.<ref name="fn_36">{{cite journal |author=Leucht S, Wahlbeck K, Hamann J, Kissling W |title=New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9369 |pages=1581–9 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12747876 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13306-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(03)13306-5 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

Service-user led movements have become integral to the recovery process in [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]; groups such as the [[Hearing Voices Network]] and the [[Paranoia Network]] have developed a self-help approach that aims to provide support and assistance outside the traditional medical model adopted by mainstream psychiatry. By avoiding framing personal experience in terms of criteria for [[mental illness]] or [[mental health]], they aim to destigmatize the experience and encourage individual responsibility and a positive self-image.

===Course===
The International Study of Schizophrenia (ISoS), coordinated by the [[World Health Organization]], carried out a long-term follow-up study of 1633 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia around the world. Outcome after 10 and 15 years varied substantially between individuals and countries. Overall over half of those available for follow-up had recovered in terms of symptomology ([[Bleuler Scale]] of 4) and over a third on combined symptomology and good functioning ([[GAF]] greater than 60). Around one sixth of those were "judged as having achieved complete recovery, in the sense of no longer requiring any form of treatment", although some still had some level of symptomology or disability. There was significant "late recovery" even after continued problems and treatment failures. It was concluded that: "the ISoS findings join others in relieving patients, carers and clinicians of the chronicity paradigm which dominated thinking throughout much of the 20th century."<Ref>{{cite journal |author=Harrison G, Hopper K, Craig T, ''et al'' |title=Recovery from psychotic illness: a 15- and 25-year international follow-up study |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=178 |issue= |pages=506–17 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11388966 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11388966 |accessdate=2008-07-04 |doi=10.1192/bjp.178.6.506}}</ref>

A review of major longitudinal studies in North America also found large variation in outcomes, and that the course could be mild, moderate, or severe. Outcome was on average worse than for other psychotic and psychiatric disorders, but between 21% and 57% showed good outcome, depending on the strictness of the criteria used. "Very few" showed a deteriorating course, although the danger of suicide and early death was indicated. It was noted that: "Of central importance, there is now evidence that a moderate number of schizophrenia patients do have complete symptomatic remissions without further relapses, at least for a good period of time, and that some of these patients may not require maintenance medication."<ref name="Jobe2005">{{cite journal |author=Jobe TH, Harrow M |title=Long-term outcome of patients with schizophrenia: a review |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=14 |pages=892–900 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16494258 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2005/december/cjp-dec-05-Harrow-IR.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>

An important additional finding from the [[World Health Organization]] studies was that individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have much better long-term outcomes in "[[developing countries]]" ([[India]], [[Colombia]] and [[Nigeria]]) than in "[[developed countries]]" ([[United States|USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Denmark]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Japan]], and [[Russia]]),<ref name="fn_44">{{cite journal |author=Hopper K, Wanderling J |title=Revisiting the developed versus developing country distinction in course and outcome in schizophrenia: results from ISoS, the WHO collaborative followup project.

===Defining recovery===
Rates are not always comparable across studies because exact definitions of remission and recovery have not been widely established. A "Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group" has proposed standardized ''remission'' criteria involving "improvements in core signs and symptoms to the extent that any remaining symptoms are of such low intensity that they no longer interfere significantly with behavior and are below the threshold typically utilized in justifying an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andreasen NC, Carpenter WT, Kane JM, Lasser RA, Marder SR, Weinberger DR |title=Remission in schizophrenia: proposed criteria and rationale for consensus |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=441–9 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15741458 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.3.441 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15741458 |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Standardized ''recovery'' criteria have also been proposed by a number of different researchers, with the stated DSM definitions of a "complete return to premorbid levels of functioning” or "complete return to full functioning" seen as inadequate, impossible to measure, incompatible with the variability in how society defines normal psychosocial functioning, and contributing to self-fulfilling pessimism and stigma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liberman RP, Kopelowicz A|year=2005 |month=June |title=Recovery From Schizophrenia: A Concept in Search of Research |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=735–742 |url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/56/6/735 |accessdate=2008-07-07 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.56.6.735 |pmid=15939952}}</ref> Some [[mental health professionals]] may have quite different basic perceptions and concepts of recovery than individuals with the diagnosis, including those in the [[consumer/survivor movement]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davidson L, Schmutte T, Dinzeo T, Andres-Hyman R |title=Remission and recovery in schizophrenia: practitioner and patient perspectives |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17984297 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm122 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17984297 |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> One notable limitation of nearly all the research criteria is failure to address the person's own evaluations and feelings about their life. Schizophrenia and recovery often involve a continuing loss of self-esteem, alienation from friends and family, interruption of school and career, and social stigma, "experiences that cannot just be reversed or forgotten."<ref name="Bellack06"/> An increasingly influential [[Recovery model|model]] defines recovery as a process, similar to being "in recovery" from drug and alcohol problems, and emphasizes a personal journey involving factors such as hope, choice, empowerment, social inclusion and achievement.<ref name="Bellack06"/>

===Predictors===

Several factors have been associated with a better overall prognosis: Being female, acute (vs. insidious) onset of symptoms, older age of first episode, predominantly positive (rather than negative) symptoms, presence of mood symptoms, and good pre-illness functioning.<ref name="Davidson_Glashan_1997">{{cite journal |author=Davidson L, McGlashan TH |title=The varied outcomes of schizophrenia |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=34–43 |year=1997 |month=February |pmid=9040921 }}</ref><ref name="Lieberman_et_al_1996">{{cite journal |author=Lieberman JA, Koreen AR, Chakos M, ''et al'' |title=Factors influencing treatment response and outcome of first-episode schizophrenia: implications for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=57 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=5–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8823344}}</ref> The strengths and internal resources of the individual concerned, such as determination or "[[psychological resilience]]", have also been associated with better prognosis.<ref name="Jobe2005"/> The attitude and level of support from people in the individual's life can have a significant impact; research framed in terms of the negative aspects of this - the level of critical comments, hostility, and intrusive or controlling attitudes (termed high '[[Expressed emotion]]' by researchers) - has consistently indicated links to relapse.<ref name="fn_70">{{cite journal |author=Bebbington P, Kuipers L |title=The predictive utility of expressed emotion in schizophrenia: an aggregate analysis |journal=Psychol Med |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=707–18 |year=1994 |month=August |pmid=7991753}}</ref> Most research on predictive factors is correlational in nature, however, and a clear cause-and-effect relationship is often difficult to establish.

===Mortality===
In a study of over 168,000 Swedish citizens undergoing psychiatric treatment, schizophrenia was associated with an average life expectancy of approximately 80–85% of that of the general population. Women with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were found to have a slightly better life expectancy than that of men, and as a whole, a diagnosis of schizophrenia was associated with a better life expectancy than [[substance abuse]], [[personality disorder]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]].<ref name="fn_45">{{cite journal |author=Hannerz H, Borgå P, Borritz M |title=Life expectancies for individuals with psychiatric diagnoses |journal=Public Health |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=328–37 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11593442 |doi=10.1038/sj.ph.1900785 }}</ref> Other identified factors include smoking, poor diet, little exercise and the negative health effects of psychiatric drugs.<ref name="Brown_Barraclough_2000" />

There is a higher than average [[suicide]] rate associated with schizophrenia. The psychiatric literature typically states that the proportion is 10%, but a more recent analysis of studies and statistics gives an estimate of 4.9%, most often occurring in the period following first hospital admission/onset.<ref>Palmer BA, Pankratz VS, Bostwick JM.

===Violence===
The relationship between violent acts and schizophrenia is a contentious topic. Current research indicates that the percentage of people with schizophrenia who commit violent acts is higher than the percentage of people without any disorder, but lower than is found for disorders such as [[alcoholism]], and the difference is reduced or not found in same-neighbourhood comparisons when related factors are taken into account, notably sociodemographic variables and [[substance misuse]].<ref name="Walsh02">{{cite journal |author=Walsh E, Buchanan A, Fahy T |title=Violence and schizophrenia: examining the evidence |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=180 |issue= |pages=490–5 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12042226 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12042226 |accessdate=2008-07-04 |doi=10.1192/bjp.180.6.490}}</ref><ref name="Stuart 03">{{cite journal |author=Stuart H |title=Violence and mental illness: an overview |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=121–124 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=16946914 |pmc=1525086 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Steadman HJ, Mulvey EP, Monahan J, ''et al'' |title=Violence by people discharged from acute psychiatric inpatient facilities and by others in the same neighborhoods |journal=Arch.

The occurrence of [[psychosis]] in schizophrenia has sometimes been linked to a higher risk of violent acts. Findings on the specific role of delusions or hallucinations have been inconsistent, but have focused on delusional jealousy, perception of threat and command hallucinations. It has been proposed that a certain type of individual with schizophrenia may be most likely to offend, characterized by a history of educational difficulties, low [[IQ]], conduct disorder, early-onset substance misuse and offending prior to diagnosis.<ref name= "Mullen 06"/>

A consistent finding is that individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are often the [[victim of a crime|victims]] of violent crime—at least 14 times more often than they are perpetrators.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brekke JS, Prindle C, Bae SW, Long JD |title=Risks for individuals with schizophrenia who are living in the community |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=52 |issue=10 |pages=1358–66 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11585953 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11585953 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref><ref name="fn_55">{{cite journal |author=Fitzgerald PB, de Castella AR, Filia KM, Filia SL, Benitez J, Kulkarni J |title=Victimization of patients with schizophrenia and related disorders |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=169–74 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15701066 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2005.01539.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0004-8674&date=2005&volume=39&issue=3&spage=169 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> Another consistent finding is a link to substance misuse, particularly alcohol,<ref name="fn_51">{{cite journal |author=Walsh E, Gilvarry C, Samele C, ''et al'' |title=Predicting violence in schizophrenia: a prospective study |journal=Schizophr.

==Alternative approaches==
An approach broadly known as the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, most active in the 1960s, opposes the orthodox medical view of schizophrenia as an illness.<ref name="Cooper1969">{{cite book |author=Cooper, David A. |title=The Dialectics of Liberation (Pelican) |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |location=London, England |year=1969 |isbn=0-14-021029-6}}</ref> Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] argued that psychiatric patients are not ill, but rather individuals with unconventional thoughts and behavior that make society uncomfortable.<ref name="Szasz1984">{{cite book |author=Szasz, Thomas Stephen |title=The myth of mental illness: foundations of a theory of personal conduct |publisher=Harper & Row |location=San Francisco |year=1974|isbn=0-06-091151-4}}</ref> He argues that society unjustly seeks to control them by classifying their behavior as an illness and forcibly treating them as a method of [[social control]]. According to this view, "schizophrenia" does not actually exist but is merely a form of [[Social constructionism|social construction]], created by society's concept of what constitutes normality and abnormality. Szasz has never considered himself to be "anti-psychiatry" in the sense of being against psychiatric treatment, but simply believes that treatment should be conducted between consenting adults, rather than imposed upon anyone against his or her will. Similarly, psychiatrists [[R. D. Laing]], [[Silvano Arieti]], [[Theodore Lidz]] and [[Colin A. Ross|Colin Ross]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Colin R|title=Schizophrenia: Innovations in Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004 |isbn=0789022699}}</ref> have argued that the symptoms of what is called mental illness are comprehensible reactions to impossible demands that society and particularly family life places on some sensitive individuals. Laing, Arieti, Lidz and Ross were notable in valuing the ''content'' of [[psychosis|psychotic]] experience as worthy of interpretation, rather than considering it simply as a secondary and essentially meaningless marker of underlying psychological or neurological distress. Laing described eleven case studies of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and argued that the content of their actions and statements was meaningful and logical in the context of their family and life situations.<ref>R.D. Laing's and Aaron Esterson. ''Sanity, Madness and the Family'' (1964)</ref> In 1956, [[Palo Alto]], [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues [[Paul Watzlawick]], [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Donald Jackson]], and [[Jay Haley]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bateson G, Jackson DD, Haley J, Weakland JH|year=1956 |title=Toward a theory of schizophrenia |journal=Behavioral Science |volume=1 |pages=251–264}}</ref> articulated a theory of schizophrenia, related to Laing's work, as stemming from [[double bind]] situations where a person receives different or contradictory messages. Madness was therefore an expression of this distress and should be valued as a [[catharsis|cathartic]] and transformative experience. In the books ''Schizophrenia and the Family'' and ''The Origin and Treatment of Schizophrenic Disorders'' Lidz and his colleagues explain their belief that parental behaviour can result in mental illness in children. Arieti's ''[[Interpretation of Schizophrenia]]'' won the 1975 scientific [[National Book Award]] in the United States.

The concept of schizophrenia as a result of civilization has been developed further by psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]''; he proposed that until the beginning of historic times, schizophrenia or a similar condition was the normal state of human consciousness.<ref name="Jaynes1976">{{cite book |author =Jaynes J |title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1976 |isbn=0-395-20729-0}}</ref> This would take the form of a "[[bicameral mind]]" where a normal state of low affect, suitable for routine activities, would be interrupted in moments of crisis by "mysterious voices" giving instructions, which early people characterized as interventions from the gods.

===Alternative medical treatments===
A branch of [[alternative medicine]] that deals with schizophrenia is known as [[orthomolecular psychiatry]]. Orthomolecular psychiatry considers the schizophrenias to be a group of disorders; management entails performing the appropriate diagnostic tests and then providing the appropriate therapy.<ref name = Pfeiffer>{{cite book |author=Pfeiffer, Carl C. |title=Nutrition and Mental Illness: An Orthomolecular Approach to Balancing Body Chemistry |publisher=Healing Art Press |isbn=0-89281-226-5}}</ref> Vitamin B-3 ([[Niacin]]) has been proposed as an effective treatment in some cases.<ref>{{cite book |author=Walker M, Hoffer A |title=Orthomolecular nutrition: new lifestyle for super good health |publisher=Keats Publishing |location=Los Angeles |year=1978 |isbn=0-87983-154-5 }}</ref> The body's adverse reactions to [[gluten]] are [[gluten-free, casein-free diet|implicated in some alternative theories]]; proponents of orthomolecular psychiatric thought claim that an adverse reaction to gluten is involved in the etiology of some cases.

==History==

Accounts of a schizophrenia-like [[syndrome]] are thought to be rare in the historical record prior to the 1800s, although reports of irrational, unintelligible, or uncontrolled behavior were common.<ref name="Heinrichs2003">{{cite journal |author=Heinrichs RW |title=Historical origins of schizophrenia: two early madmen and their illness |journal=J Hist Behav Sci |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=349–63 |year=2003 |pmid=14601041 |doi=10.1002/jhbs.10152}}</ref> There has been an interpretation that brief notes in the Ancient Egyptian [[Ebers papyrus]] may imply schizophrenia,<ref>Okasha, A., Okasha, T.

[[Image:Emil Kraepelin.png|left|thumb|[[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926) refined the concept of [[psychosis]].]]

A detailed case report in 1797 concerning [[James Tilly Matthews]], and accounts by [[Phillipe Pinel]] published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of schizophrenia in the medical and psychiatric literature.<ref name="Heinrichs2003"/> Schizophrenia was first described as a distinct syndrome affecting teenagers and young adults by [[Bénédict Morel]] in 1853, termed ''démence précoce'' (literally 'early dementia'). The term [[dementia praecox]] was used in 1891 by [[Arnold Pick]] to in a case report of a psychotic disorder. In 1893 [[Emil Kraepelin]] introduced a broad new distinction in the [[classification of mental disorders]] between ''[[dementia praecox]]'' and [[mood disorder]] (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). Kraepelin believed that ''dementia praecox'' was primarily a disease of the brain,<ref name="fn_2">Kraepelin E. (1907) ''Text book of psychiatry (7th ed)'' (trans. A.R. Diefendorf). London: Macmillan.</ref> and particularly a form of [[dementia]], distinguished from other forms of dementia, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], which typically occur later in life.<ref name="fn_49">{{cite book |author=Hansen RA, Atchison B |title=Conditions in occupational therapy: effect on occupational performance |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2000 |isbn=0-683-30417-8}}</ref> Kraepelin's classification slowly gained acceptance. There were objections to the use of the term "dementia" despite cases of recovery, and some defence of diagnoses it replaced such as adolescent insanity.<ref>McConaghey, J.C. (1905) [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/citation/51/213/340 Adolescent Insanity: A Protest against the Use of the Term "Dementia Præcox"] Journal of Mental Science (1905) 51: 340-348.</ref>

The word ''schizophrenia''—which translates roughly as "splitting of the mind" and comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ''schizein'' (σχίζειν, "to split") and ''phrēn'', ''phren-'' (φρήν, φρεν-, "[[mind]]")<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuhn R; tr. Cahn CH |title=Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology |journal=Hist Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=2004 |pages=361–6 |doi=10.1177/0957154X04044603 |pmid=15386868}}</ref>—was coined by [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1908 and was intended to describe the separation of function between [[personality psychology|personality]], [[thought|thinking]], [[memory]], and [[perception]]. Bleuler described the main symptoms as 4 ''A'''s: flattened ''Affect'', ''Autism'', impaired ''Association'' of ideas and ''Ambivalence''.<ref name="fn_78">{{cite journal |author=Stotz-Ingenlath G |title=Epistemological aspects of Eugen Bleuler's conception of schizophrenia in 1911 |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=153–9 |year=2000 |pmid=11079343|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=1386-7423&volume=3&page=153|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-03 |doi=10.1023/A:1009919309015}}</ref> Bleuler realized that the illness was not a [[dementia]] as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated and hence proposed the term schizophrenia instead.

The term ''schizophrenia'' is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a "split personality". Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities, schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct multiple personalities. The confusion arises in part due to the meaning of Bleuler's term ''schizophrenia'' (literally "split" or "shattered mind"). The first known misuse of the term to mean "split personality" was in an article by the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] in 1933.<ref name="fn_3">{{cite book |author=Porter, Roy; Berrios, G. E. |title=A history of clinical psychiatry: the origin and history of psychiatric disorders |publisher=Athlone Press |location=London |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-485-24211-7}}</ref>

In the first half of the twentieth century schizophrenia was considered to be a hereditary defect, and sufferers were subject to [[eugenics]] in many countries. Hundreds of thousands were [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilized]], with or without consent—the majority in [[Nazi Germany]], the [[United States]], and [[Scandinavia]]n countries.<ref name="fn_76">{{cite journal |author=Allen GE |title=The social and economic origins of genetic determinism: a case history of the American Eugenics Movement, 1900-1940 and its lessons for today |journal=Genetica |volume=99 |issue=2-3 |pages=77–88 |year=1997 |pmid=9463076  |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0016-6707&volume=99&page=77 |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-07-03 |doi=10.1007/BF02259511}}</ref><ref name="fn_77">{{cite book |author=Bentall RP, Read JE, Mosher LR |title=Models of Madness: Psychological, Social and Biological Approaches to Schizophrenia |publisher=Brunner-Routledge |location=Philadelphia |year=2004 |isbn=1-58391-906-6}}</ref> Along with other people labeled "mentally unfit", many diagnosed with schizophrenia were murdered in the Nazi "[[Action T4]]" program.<ref name="Lifton_2000">{{cite book |author=Lifton, Robert Jay |title=The Nazi doctors: medical killing and the psychology of genocide |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1986 |isbn=0-465-04905-2}}</ref>

The diagnostic description of schizophrenia has changed over time. It became clear after the 1971 US-UK Diagnostic Study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in America than in Europe.<ref name="Wing1971">{{cite journal |author=Wing JK |title=International comparisons in the study of the functional psychoses |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=77–81 |year=1971 |month=January |pmid=4926366}}</ref> This was partly due to looser diagnostic criteria in the US, which used the [[DSM-II]] manual, contrasting with Europe and its [[ICD-9]]. This was one of the factors in leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but the revision of the whole DSM manual, resulting in the publication of the [[DSM-III]].<ref name="Wilson1993">{{cite journal |author=Wilson M |title=DSM-III and the transformation of American psychiatry: a history |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=399–410 |year=1993 |month=March |pmid=8434655 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8434655 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

[[Social stigma]] has been identified as a major obstacle in the recovery of patients with schizophrenia.<ref>McGorry, Patrick (2003). "The Influence of Stigma on Preventive Efforts in Psychotic Disorders," in ''Schizophrenia (WPA Series in Evidence & Experience in Psychiatry)'', p. 292.</ref> In a large, representative sample from a 1999 study, 12.8% of Americans believed that individuals with schizophrenia were "very likely" to do something violent against others, and 48.1% said that they were "somewhat likely" to. Over 74% said that people with schizophrenia were either "not very able" or "not able at all" to make decisions concerning their treatment, and 70.2% said the same of money management decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pescosolido BA, Monahan J, Link BG, Stueve A, Kikuzawa S |title=The public's view of the competence, dangerousness, and need for legal coercion of persons with mental health problems |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=89 |issue=9 |pages=1339–45 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10474550 |pmc=1508769 |doi= |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10474550 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> The perception of individuals with psychosis as violent has more than doubled in prevalence since the 1950s, according to one meta-analysis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phelan JC, Link BG, Stueve A, Pescosolido BA|year=2000 |month=June |title=Public Conceptions of Mental Illness in 1950 and 1996: What Is Mental Illness and Is It to be Feared? |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=188–207 |doi=10.2307/2676305}}</ref>

The book and film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' chronicled the life of [[John Forbes Nash]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning mathematician who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''Devrai'' (Featuring [[Atul Kulkarni]]) is a presentation of a patient with schizophrenia. The film, set in the [[Konkan]] region of [[Maharashtra]] in Western [[India]], shows the behavior, mentality, and struggle of the patient as well as his loved-ones. It also portrays the treatment of this mental illness using medication, dedication and plenty of patience by the close relatives of the patient. Other factual books have been written by relatives on family members; Australian journalist [[Anne Deveson]] told the story of her son's battle with schizophrenia in ''Tell me I'm Here'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Anne Deveson|Deveson A]] |title=Tell Me I'm Here |publisher=Penguin |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-14-027257-7}}</ref> later made into a movie.

In [[Mikhail Bulgakov|Bulgakov's]] ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' the poet Ivan Bezdomnyj is institutionalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia after witnessing the devil (Woland) predict Berlioz's death. The book ''[[The Eden Express]]'' by [[Mark Vonnegut]] recounts his struggle with schizophrenia and his recovering journey.
