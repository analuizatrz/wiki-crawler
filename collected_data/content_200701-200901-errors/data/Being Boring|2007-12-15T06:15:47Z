"'''Being Boring'''" is a single by the British pop group the [[Pet Shop Boys]]. As the second single from the 1990 album ''[[Behaviour (album)|Behaviour]]'', after "So Hard" which was released before the album, "Being Boring" was not particularly successful upon release, reaching only number twenty in the [[UK singles chart]] and being the first single released by the group not to get into the top ten since "[[Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)]]" four years previously. 

The song is concerned with the idea of growing up and how people's perceptions and values change as they grow older. The title apparently materialised after someone in Japan accused the duo of being boring. The title is also derived from a [[Zelda Fitzgerald]] quotation, "she refused to be bored chiefly because she wasn't boring".

The track was originally pieced together in a studio in West Glasgow, where the music for 'My October symphony', 'The end of the world' and the unreleased 'Love and war' were also done.<ref>[http://www.petshopboys.net/html/interviews/behaviuor001.shtml Remastered Behaviour liner note interview - Being boring]</ref>

====Live====
Despite this, "Being Boring" has been a regularly-played song at concerts and it's considered one of the best and most beautiful "Pet's songs" by the fans. Ironically, due to various factors, including it being hard to sing, it wasn't performed on the Performance Tour in 1991. This led to many fans, including [[Axl Rose]] complaining of its omission.<ref>[http://www.petshopboys.net/html/interviews/behaviuor001.shtml Remastered Behaviour liner note interview - Being boring]</ref>

====Video====
The video, the first by fashion-photographer [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], totally in black and white, shows a house party and begins with a nude swimmer and a message: "I came from Newcastle in the North of England. We used to have lots of parties where everyone got dressed up and on one party invitation was the quote 'she was never bored because she was never boring'. The song is about growing up - the ideals that you have when you're young and how they turn out".

Australian singer [[Merril Bainbridge]] [[cover version|covered]] the song as the tenth track from her debut album ''[[The Garden (Merril Bainbridge album)|The Garden]]'' released in [[1995]].

====B-side====
The b-side, "We all feel better in the dark" was written around a piece of music Chris Lowe had composed. As he explains, "The idea came from a tape I bought from a health food shop round the corner from the studio:''The Secrets Of Sexual Attraction''. The words are terrible. Awful. Embarrassing." <ref>[http://www.petshopboys.net/html/interviews/behaviuor012.shtml Remastered Behaviour liner note interview - We all feel better in the dark]</ref> 

The track proved to be a fan favourite and was performed live during their Performance Tour in 1991. The remix 12" includes two mixes of the track by [[Brothers In Rhythm]].
