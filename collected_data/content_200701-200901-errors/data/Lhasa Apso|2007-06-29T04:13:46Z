The '''Lhasa Apso''' is a small [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] originally from [[Tibet]].  

==Appearance==
Lhasas are about 10 to 11 inches at the [[withers]] and weigh about 14-18 pounds. The females are slightly smaller, and weigh between 12-14lbs. The breed standard requires dark brown eyes, with black pigmentation on eye rims and a black nose. Texture of the coat is hard, straight, dense, not woolly or silky. It is often referred to as "moppy". It is of good length, and comes in a variety of colors.  All colors are equally acceptable, with or without black tippings.   The tail should be carried in a tight screw over the back.

==Temperament==
Having been bred to be sentinel or [[guard dog|watch dog]]s, Lhasa Apsos tend to be alert and have a keen sense of hearing with a rich, sonorous bark that belies their size (some are known as "singers").{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Lhasa Apsos, although small, can exhibit brief periods of explosive energy.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.  Unique personality characteristics of Lhaso Apsos have gained them a reputation in some circles as being a very emotive breed that in some cases prove themselves to be completely fearless.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

If properly raised it will come to appreciate bathing, hair combing and cutting. The Lhasa Apso is a long-lived breed, with some living in good health into their early 20s.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==History==
The heavy coat of Lhasas can also be explained by the geographical features of Tibet: the temperature frequently drops below freezing thus making it hard for a dog to survive without sufficient insulation. Lhasas were rarely groomed by their owners thus allowing the breed to adapt to the harsh weather.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

In 1901 Mrs. A. McLaren Morrison brought the Lhasa Apso to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] where it was registered as an official breed in [[The Kennel Club]] in 1902.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The original American pair was a gift from [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] to C. Suydam Cutting, arriving in the [[United States]] in the early [[1930s]].  The [[American Kennel Club]] officially accepted the breed in 1935 in the Terrier group, and in 1959 transferred the breed to the Non-Sporting group.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Recently, DNA Analysis has identified the Lhasa Apso as one of the 14 most [[ancient dog breeds]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

In the 1950s the Lhasa Apso and [[Maltese]] were accidentally bred creating a type of dog that later became known as the [[Kyi-Leo]] rare dog breed in the 1970s.

==Miscellaneous==

The Brazilian comic series [[Monica's Gang]] features a Lhasa Apso named [[Fluffy (Monica's Gang)|Fluffy]] which belongs to [[Jimmy Five]].
