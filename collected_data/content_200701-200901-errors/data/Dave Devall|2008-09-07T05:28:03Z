Colonel '''David "Dave" Devall''' is a well-known meteorologist who works for television station [[CFTO-TV]] (''[[CTV Television Network|CTV]] Toronto'') in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. He presents the weather forecast on the station's 6pm newscast (''[[CTV News]] at Six''), and has been an employee with the station since its launch in 1961.

Devall was born, raised, and educated in Toronto (graduate of [[York Memorial Collegiate]] in the old [[York, Ontario|City of York]]). While studying Radio and Television Arts at Ryerson Polytechnic (now [[Ryerson University]]), he also served in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF), where part of his training centred on meteorology. In 1956, while still a student, he worked at [[CFPL-TV]] in [[London, Ontario]]; he then moved to Toronto radio station [[CFRB]], where he stayed from 1957-1958. After graduating in 1958, he worked at [[CHEX-TV]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]]. When CFTO launched in 1961, Devall auditioned with 2,000 other hopefuls; he was one of six people hired as a broadcaster. 

Devall's voice was heard across Canada as [[Jim Perry (television)|Jim Perry]]'s announcer on many of his game shows, including ''[[Definition (TV series)|Definition]]'', ''[[Headline Hunters]]'' and ''[[Eye Bet]]'', as well as in [[Ford]] television commercials on the popular ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' program.

Despite various new weathercasters, Devall remains the senior and top weatherman at the station, and also appears daily on [[CTV Newsnet]]. His funny antics have made him popular with Toronto viewers. During his early years, he would stand behind a clear [[acrylic glass]] weather map, which necessitated writing backwards with a slightly pink eye shadow type marker. He continues the tradition today with a single daily weather word (since the weather maps are now generated electronically.)

Devall was made honorary colonel of the [[Canadian Forces]] Squadron 436 at [[CFB Trenton]] in February 2007.
