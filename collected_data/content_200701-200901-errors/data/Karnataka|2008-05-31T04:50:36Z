'''Karnataka''' ({{lang-kn|ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ}}, [[help:IPA|pronounced]] {{Audio-IPA|Karnataka.ogg|[kəɾˈnɑːʈəkɑː]}}) is a [[States and territories of India|state]] in the southern part of [[India]]. It was [[Unification of Karnataka|created]] on [[November 1]] [[1956]], with the passing of the [[States Reorganisation Act]]. Originally known as the ''[[Mysore State|State of Mysore]]'', it was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973. 

Karnataka is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the  north, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the southwest. The state covers an area of {{convert|191791|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} or 5.83% of the total geographical area of India. It is the [[List of states of India by area|eighth largest Indian state by area]], [[List of states of India by population|the ninth largest by population]] and comprises 29 [[Districts of India|districts]]. [[Kannada language|Kannada]] is the official and most widely spoken language.

Though [[Origin of Karnataka's name|several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''nādu'', meaning ''elevated land''. ''Karu nadu'' may also be read as ''Karu'' (black) and ''nadu'' (region), as a reference to the [[Vertisol|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayaluseeme]] region of Karnataka. The [[British Raj|British]] used the word ''Carnatic'' (sometimes ''Karnatak'') to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the [[Krishna River]].<ref>See [[Lord Macaulay]]'s life of Clive and James Tallboys Wheeler: ''Early History of British India'', London (1878) p.98. The principal meaning is the western half of this area, but the rulers there controlled the [[Coromandel Coast]] as well.</ref> 

With an antiquity that dates to the [[paleolithic]], Karnataka has also been home to [[Political history of medieval Karnataka|some of the most powerful empires of ancient India]]. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]](Karnataka Music) and [[Hindustani music|Hindustani]] traditions. Writers in the Kannada language have received the most number of [[Jnanpith|Jnanpith awards]] in India.  [[Bangalore]] is the capital city of the state and is at the forefront of the rapid economic and technological development that India is experiencing.

==History==

[[Image:Belur4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hoysala Empire]] sculptural articulation in [[Belur]]]]

The history of Karnataka can be traced back to a [[paleolithic]] hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region. Evidence of [[neolithic]] and [[megalithic]] cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in [[Harappa]] was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesize about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in 3000 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070121024542/http://metalrg.iisc.ernet.in/~wootz/heritage/K-hertage.htm|title=THE Golden Heritage of Karnataka|author=S.

Four centuries of [[Satavahana Dynasty|Satavahana]] rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the [[Kadambas]] and the [[Western Gangas]], marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The [[Kadamba Dynasty]], founded by [[Mayurasharma]], had its capital at [[Banavasi]];<ref name="origin">From the [[Talagunda]] inscription (Dr. B. L.

These were also the first kingdoms to use [[Kannada language|Kannada]] in administration, as evidenced by the [[Halmidi inscription]] and a fifth-century copper coin discovered at Banavasi.<ref name="first">From the Halmidi inscription (Ramesh 1984, pp. 10–11.)</ref><ref name="hal">Kamath (2001), p. 10.</ref> These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the [[Badami Chalukyas]],<ref name="cha">The Chalukyas hailed from present-day Karnataka (Keay (2000), p. 168.)</ref><ref name="cha1">The Chalukyas were native ''[[Kannadigas]]'' (N.

At the turn of the first millennium, the [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]] gained power in the region. [[Hoysala literature|Literature]] flourished during this time, which led to the distinctive Kannada [[meter (music)|literary metres]] and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the [[Hoysala architecture|Vesara style of architecture]].<ref name="sang1">Kamath (2001), pp. 132–134.</ref><ref name="sang">Sastri (1955), pp. 358&ndash;359, 361.</ref><ref name="chenna">Foekema (1996), p. 14.</ref><ref name="chenna1">Kamath (2001), pp. 122&ndash;124.</ref> The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought parts of modern [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] under its rule. In the early 14th century, [[Harihara]] and [[Bukka Raya]] established the [[Vijayanagara empire]] with its capital, ''Hosapattana'' (later named [[Vijayanagara]]), on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries.<ref name="vij">Kamath (2001), pp. 157–160.</ref><ref name="vij1">Kulke and Rothermund (2004), p. 188.</ref> 

In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara Empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the [[Battle of Talikota]].<ref name="bin">Kamath (2001), pp. 190&ndash;191.</ref> The [[Bijapur Sultanate]], which had risen after the demise of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; it was defeated by the [[Moghul empire|Moghuls]] in the late 17th century.<ref name="conf">Kamath (2001), p. 201.</ref><ref name="erst">Kamath (2001), p. 202.</ref> The Bahamani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style.<ref name="gol">Kamath (2001), p. 207.</ref>   

[[Image:Tipu Sultan BL.jpg|left|thumb|An [[Anglo-Mysore wars|inveterate enemy of the British]], [[Tippu Sultan]] was one of the most powerful  rulers in [[India]] before the advent of the [[British Raj]]]]

In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], the [[British Raj|British]], and other powers. In the south, the [[Mysore Kingdom]], former [[vassal]]s of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent.<ref name="ind">Kamath (2001), p. 171.</ref> With the death of [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar II]], [[Haidar Ali]], the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region.

As the "[[doctrine of lapse]]" gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, [[Kittur Chennamma]], [[Sangolli Rayanna]] and others spearheaded rebellions in Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Other uprisings followed, such as the ones at [[Supa]], [[Bagalkot]], [[Shorapur]], [[Nargund]] and [[Dandeli]]. These rebellions which coincided with the 1857 war of independence were led by Mundargi Bhimarao, Bhaskar Rao Bhave, the Halagali Bedas, Venkatappa Nayaka and others. By the late 19th century, the freedom movement had gained momentum; [[Karnad Sadashiva Rao]], [[Aluru Venkata Raya]], [[S. Nijalingappa]], [[Kengal Hanumanthaiah]], [[Nittoor Srinivasa Rau]] and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/May202007/sundayherald200705192574.asp|title=The rising in the south|publisher=[[Deccan Herald]]| date= 2007-05-20|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=The Printers (Mysore) Private Limited|first=Suryanath |last=Kamath}}</ref>

After India's independence, the Maharaja, [[Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar]], allowed his kingdom's accession to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its ''Rajpramukh'' (head of state) until 1975.  Following the long-standing demand of the  [[Unification of Karnataka|Ekikarana Movement]], Kodagu and Kannada speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the [[States Reorganization Act]] of 1956. The thus expanded state was renamed  Karnataka, seventeen years later, in 1973.<ref name="Unification">{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/images/Rajyotsava12352120051031.asp|title=History in the making|publisher= [[Deccan Herald]] | date= [[2005-11-01]]|first=Prem Paul |last=Ninan|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Karnataka|Rainfall in Karnataka}}
[[Image:Jog Rani.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Jog Falls]] are the highest plunge waterfalls in India, formed by [[Sharavathi River]]]]

The state has three principal geographical zones: the coastal region of [[Karavali]], the hilly [[Malnad]] region comprising the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Bayaluseeme]] region comprising the plains of the [[Deccan plateau]]. The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme region, the northern part of which is the second largest [[arid]] region in [[India]].<ref name="arid"> {{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1817/18170420.htm|first=Parvathi |last=Menon|title=Karnataka's agony|work=The Frontline, Volume 18 - Issue 17, Aug. 18 - 31, 2001|publisher=Frontline|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> The highest point in Karnataka is the [[Mullayanagiri]] hills in [[Chikkamagaluru district]] which has an altitude of {{convert|1929|m|ft|0}}.

Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations<ref name="geology">{{cite web|url=http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/paper/TR109/TR109_TVR.pdf|author=Ramachandra T.V. and Kamakshi G.|title=Bioresource Potential of Karnataka|work=Technical Report No. 109, November 2005|publisher=Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore|accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> — the ''[[Archean]] complex'' made up of [[Dharwad]] [[schist]]s and granitic [[gneiss]]es, the ''[[Proterozoic]]'' non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the ''Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits'' and the tertiary and recent [[laterite]]s and alluvial deposits.  Significantly, about 60% of the state is comprised of the ''Archean complex'' which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks.  Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the [[Deccan Traps]] were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. [[Entisol]]s, [[Inceptisols]], [[Mollisol]]s, [[Spodosol]]s, [[Alfisol]]s, [[Ultisol]]s, [[Oxisol]]s, [[Aridisol]]s, [[Vertisol]]s, [[Andisol]]s and [[Histosol]]s.<ref name="geology"/> Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. Red, [[Lateritic soil|lateritic]], [[Black soil|black]], alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.

Karnataka experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May, the monsoon season between June and September and the post-monsoon season from October till December. [[Meteorology|Meteorologically]], Karnataka is divided into three zones — coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, the coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about {{convert|3638.5|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=on|0}} per annum, far in excess of the state average of {{convert|1139|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}.

About {{convert|38724|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of Karnataka (i.e. 20% of the state's geographic area) is covered by forests. The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests.

Each district is governed by a district commissioner or district magistrate. The districts are further divided into sub-divisions, which are governed by sub-divisional magistrates; sub-divisions comprise blocks containing panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities.

As per the 2001 census, Karnataka's six largest cities sorted in order of decreasing population were, [[Bangalore]], [[Hubli]]-[[Dharwad]], [[Mysore]], [[Gulbarga]], [[Belgaum]] and [[Mangalore]].
