'''Valentino Zeichen''', sometimes wrongly spelled '''Zaichen''', (born c. 1938), is an [[Italian literature|Italian]] poet and writer.

==Biography==

Zeichen's origins are somewhat obscure, and his year of birth is dubious. In [[German language]] the word ''Zeichen'' means "sign", and has been suggested that his true name would be '''Giuseppe Mario Moses''', an almost certainly [[Jewish]] surname. Zeichen, however, negated this theory. [http://www.lastampalavoro.org/cmstp/rubriche/girata.asp?ID_blog=54&ID_articolo=113&ID_sezione=81]

Born in [[Fiume]], the son of an Italian-speaking [[Dalmatia]]n gardener, Zeichen moved with all his family to [[Parma]] as a refugee, since his native land was annexed by [[Yugoslavia]] after the end of [[World War II]]. In [[1950]] they moved to [[Rome]], where Zeichen currently still lives in a self-made house next to [[Via Flaminia]].

He began to write poems at the age of 18, influenced by [[Surrealism|surrealist]] authors like [[Andre Breton|Breton]] and [[Pr√©vert]]. His first work was published in 1969 on the literary review ''Nuova Corrente''. Zeichen's first novel, ''Tana per tutti'', was released in 1983.

Zeichen's poetry has been praised for his quick catch on the reader, and the subtle sense of humour underlining it. He is considered among the finests poets today in Europe. A literary award entitled to him, the ''Premio Zeichen'', is held every December in Rome: Zeichen himself is the only member of the jury.
