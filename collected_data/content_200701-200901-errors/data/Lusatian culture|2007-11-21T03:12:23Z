[[Image:Cultures, 1200 BC.PNG|right|200px|thumb|A simplified map of the central European cultures, ca [[1200 BC]]. The ''purple area'' is the '''Lusatian culture''', the central blue area is the [[Knoviz culture]], the red area is the central urnfield culture, and the orange area is the northern urnfield culture. The brown area is the [[Danubian culture]], the blue area is the [[Terramare culture]] and the green area is the [[West European Bronze Age]]. The yellow area is the [[Nordic Bronze Age]]]]
The '''Lusatian culture''' existed in the later [[Bronze Age]] and early [[Iron Age]] ([[1300 BC]]-[[500 BC]]) in eastern [[Germany]], most of [[Poland]], parts of [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] and parts of [[Ukraine]]. It covers the Periods [[Montelius]] III (early Lusatian culture) to V of the Northern-European chronological scheme.

The Lusatian culture developed from [[Trzciniec culture]] under some influence of the middle Bronze Age [[Tumulus bronze Age]] (''Hügelgräberkultur''). It is contemporaneous with the [[Urnfield]] culture found from eastern [[France]], southern Germany and Austria to [[Hungary]] and the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] in northwestern [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]]. It is followed by the early [[Iron Age]] [[Billendorf]] culture in the West. In Poland, the Lusatian culture is taken to span part of the Iron Age as well (the is only a terminological difference) and is succeeded in Montelius VIIbc in northern ranges around mouth of [[Vistula]] by the [[Pomeranian culture]] spreading south.

There were close contacts with the Nordic Bronze Age, and the Scandinavian influence on [[Pomerania]] and northern Poland during this period was so considerable that this region is sometimes included in the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture (Dąbrowski 1989:73). This influence may correspond to the arrival of [[East Germanic tribes]] from Scandinavia to the region of [[Łódź]] where the interstage between Trciniec culture and Lusatian culture was developed.

Burial was by cremation, inhumations are rare. The urn is usually accompanied by numerous, up to 40 secondary vessels. Metal grave gifts are sparse, but there are numerous hoards (e.g. Kopaniewo, Pomerania) that contain rich metalwork, both bronze and gold (hoard of Eberswalde, [[Brandenburg]]). Graves containing moulds, like at Bataune, [[Saxony]] or tuyeres attest the production of bronze tools and weapons at village level.
The 'royal' tomb of [[Seddin]], [[Brandenburg]], Germany, covered by a large earthen [[tumulus|barrow]] contained Mediterranean imports like bronze-vessels and glass beads. Cemeteries can be quite large and contain thousands of graves.

Well known settlements include [[Biskupin]] in Poland and Buch near [[Berlin]]. There are both open villages and fortified settlements (Burgwall or grod) on hilltops or in swampy areas. The ramparts were constructed of wooden boxes filled with soil or stones.

The economy was mainly based on arable agriculture, as is attested by numerous storage pits. Wheat ([[emmer]]) and six-row [[barley]] formed the basic crops, together with millet, rye and oats, peas, broad beans, lentils and [[gold of pleasure]] (Camelina sativa). Flax was grown, and remains of domesticated apples, pears and plums have been found. Cattle and pigs were the most important domestic animals, followed by sheep, goats, horses and dogs. Pictures on Iron Age urns from [[Silesia]] attest horse riding, but horses were used to draw chariots as well.
Hunting was practiced, as bones of red and roe deer, boar, bison, elk, hare, fox and wolf attest, but did not provide much of the meat consumed. The numerous frog-bones found at Biskupin may indicate that frog's legs were eaten as well.

Hoards in swampy areas are considered by some archaeologists (Hãnsel) as 'gifts for the Gods'. Human bones in 5m deep sacrificial pits in Lossow (Brandenburg) might point to human sacrifice and possible [[cannibalism]].

==History of research==

'Lausitz-type' burials were first described by the German pathologist and archaeologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821-1902). The name refers to the [[Lusatia]] (Lausitz) area in eastern Germany ([[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony]]) and Poland. Virchow identified the pottery as 'pre-Germanic' but refused to speculate on the ethnic identity of their makers.

Numerous Czech (Píč, Niederle, Červinka) and Polish (Majewski, [[Józef Kostrzewski|Kostrzewski]], Kozłowski) authors believed the Lusatians to be Proto-Slavs, while the German archaeologist A. Götze saw them as [[Thracians|Thracian]], and [[Gustaf Kossinna]] first as [[Karpo-Dacian]], a tribe mentioned by [[Zosimus]] and then as [[Illyrians|Illyrian]].

Today, most scholars have accepted the historical and changing nature of ethnic groups and do not try to continue ethnic groups known from written sources into the prehistoric period.
