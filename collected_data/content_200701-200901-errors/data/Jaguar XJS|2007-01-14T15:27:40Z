The '''Jaguar XJ-S''' (later the '''XJS''') is a [[luxury car|luxury]] [[grand tourer]] produced by the British automaker [[Jaguar Cars]]. The XJ-S replaced the legendary [[Jaguar E-Type]] (or XK-E) in September 1975, and was based on the [[Jaguar XJ|XJ saloon]]. It had been developed as the XK-F, though it was very different in character from its predecessor. Although it never had quite the same sporting image, the XJ-S was a competent grand tourer and, in fact, more aerodynamic than the E-type. The last XJS was produced on [[April 4]], [[1996]], with the [[Jaguar XK8|XK8]] taking its place.

==1976==
The first '''XJ-S''' appeared in 1975 as a 1976 model.  Power came from the [[Jaguar V12 engine|V12]] version with a choice of a [[manual transmission|manual]] or [[automatic transmission]] (but the manual was soon dropped). The XJ-S was one of only three V-12 automobiles at the time, the other two coming from Italy, with the Lamborghini and the Ferrari. Both of which the XJ-S could hold its own with. It could reach 60 mph (100 km/h) in 7.5 seconds and accelerate to 150 mph (240 km/h).  The [[Group 44]] racing team built a successful [[Trans-Am Series|Trans Am]] race car based on the XJ-S, and the car won the series' 1977 manufacturers' championship cup.

Jaguar's timing was not good: the car was launched in the wake of the first fuel crisis and the market for a 5.3-litre V12 grand tourer was very small. The styling was also the subject of much criticism, including the "flying buttresses" behind the windows.

Jaguar did seize promotional opportunities with the television series ''[[The New Avengers (TV series)|The New Avengers]]'' and ''[[Return of the Saint]]''. ''The New Avengers'' featured Mike Gambit ([[Gareth Hunt]]) who drove an XJ-S. Reliability issues meant that two XJ-S cars were used. ''Return of the Saint'' saw Simon Templar (played by [[Ian Ogilvy]]) driving an early XJ-S with the number plate "ST 1". Miniature versions were made by Corgi and proved popular. A decade and a half before, Jaguar had turned down the producers of the earlier ''Saint'' series when approached about the E-type. An XJ-S was also driven by Robert McCall ([[Edward Woodward]]) in ''[[The Equalizer]]''.  

Responding to criticisms that the XJ-S was not a worthy E-type successor, [[Pininfarina]] revealed a sporty show car in 1979 based on XJ-S mechanicals. The car never went into production.

==The 1980s==
The 1981 XJ-S received the new [[Jaguar V12 engine#5.3 HE|High-Efficiency engine]] for much better economy.  The XJ-S was also now the fastest automatic-transmission car in the world at 155 mph. In 1982, the new V12 XJ-S won first and second at the [[Tourist Trophy]] race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. In 1983 a new [[cabriolet]] version débuted with a new 3.6-litre [[Jaguar AJ6 engine]], the '''XJ-SC'''. In the XJ-SC, the rear jump seats were eliminated making it only a 2-seat car. The XJ-SC was not a full convertable but had a non-removable center targa-type structure and fixed cant rails above the doors. The rear quarter windows remained as well. With the introduction of the AJ6 engine in the XJS chassis came the availability of a 5-speed manual transmission for the 6 cylinder cars. This model with a Getrag manual transmission was not imported by Jaguar into the United states until 1994 (and then only in extremely limited numbers). A limited number of earlier 5-speed AJ6 cars did enter the US as grey market personal imports however. A V12 XJ-SC did not emerge until 1985. The two-seat XJ-SC targa-type model was replaced with a two-seat full [[convertible]] in 1988. Prior to that there was a special full convertable version called a Hess & Eisenhardt XJS offered through dealers starting in 1986. The Hess & Eisenhardt coachbuilding firm was located in Ohio and built approximately 2100 of these cars under contract from Jaguar before the official Jaguar built XJS convertible appeared in 1988 to be offered as a 1989 model. The Hess & Eisenhardt convertible differed from the later Jaguar convertible XJS as its unpadded top folded down deeper into the body structure of the car resulting in a cleaner rear profile when the roof was lowered. The later Jaguar full convertible had a heavier padded top that did not fold into as small of a bundle when in the lowered position.

In 1985, XJS drivers [[John Goss (race driver)|John Goss]] and [[Armin Hahne]] won the [[James Hardie]] [[Bathurst 1000]] motor race in [[Australia]].

In 1988 and 1989, a special XJR-S version of the V12 5.3 litre car was produced by TWR to celebrate Jaguar's win at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]. A numbered limited edition of 100 of these cars were made for European sale only. This car had a distinctive TWR-fitted body kit, special alloy wheels and suspension and handling improvements. Between 1988 and 1989 a total of 350 XJR-s cars were produced with the 5.3-litre engine. After September 1989 the change was made to a special 6.0-litre engine with a Zytec engine management system. This was different from the standard 6.0-litre engine used in the late XJS models

Jaguar did consider a luxury [[Daimler Motor Company|Daimler]] version, without the flying buttresses, but this vehicle was not put into production.

Throughout the life of the XJS, British company [http://www.lynxmotors.co.uk/ Lynx] sold a high-quality four-seat full convertible conversion. Lynx also produced approximately 75 hand-built two-door estate/shooting brake/station wagon versions of the XJS marketed under the "Lynx Eventer". The Eventer was a very elegant model, which succeeded in the overall design because it removed the flying butresses, incorporating them into the estate design.  Jaguar were urged to market their own version but never did.  Most Eventers are believed to still exist although build quality, especially on the early versions, was at best variable. Lynx have in the past supplied a new roof section (at a price!) due to poor build on early versions. If buying second-hand, use a magnet to check for plastic filler.

==1991-96==
The car was re-engineered in 1991 and renamed '''XJS''', with a convertible waiting one year. The rear windows were enlarged, though the flying buttresses stayed, as designer Geoff Lawson argued that they were part of the car's character. The car got a new 4-litre version of the [[Jaguar AJ6 engine#4.0|AJ6]], and the V12 was upped to 6 litres in 1993. At the same time the car benefited from a revision to the rear brakes, they were now fitted with outboard rear disc brakes, instead of the more complicated inboard items on previous models.  These changes begin the "face-lift" for the aging XJS.  A [[2+2 (car body style|2+2]] convertible was also introduced, as was a customized ''insignia'' line.  In 1994 the car received an updated more aerodynamic bumper fascia front and rear completing the face-lift.  1994 also marks the only year the 5 speed manual transmission xjs was imported to the United States.  Exact production figures are unknown, though it is likely there are fewer than 10.  1995, substantial revisions were made to the 4-litre AJ6 engine. The new design was designated the AJ16 to reflect the major differences between it and the original AJ6.

Production of the car came to an end in 1996, with the introduction of the [[Jaguar XK8|XK8]].

==Non-fiction television coverage==
An XJ-S was featured in the [[BBC]]'s [[Top Gear]] television series. [[James May]] purchased one for the "£1500 coupé that isn't a [[Porsche]] challenge". He spent £1100 buying it, and it proved to be the least reliable car out of a group of three cars. Despite this it outlasted the rival cars for the duration of the challenge. May later used a rather better XJ-S to successfully traverse much of [[France]] in another television programme, [[Oz and James's Big Wine Adventure]].
