==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
When his teddy bear [[List of characters from Family Guy#Other characters|Rupert]] is ruined in the park by a dog, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] is extremely miserable.  But once [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] fixes Rupert, Stewie immediately becomes attached to her and finally decides to abandon his murderous plans towards her. He eventually gets on her nerves, which leads to her having a bad dream of homicidal thoughts about him, so she turns to [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] in an attempt to calm her down.
  
Meanwhile, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] goes to see the doctor for a [[flu vaccine]], but he is informed that he needs a [[Rectal examination|prostate exam]]. However, his exam is not what he expects. Thinking that Hartman is trying to molest him by reaching into his [[anus]], Peter enters a period of shock. No matter how much he is told by people like Lois and Hartman that it was just a prostate exam, he refuses to believe that. Trying to find revenge, Peter takes Hartman to court and wins the case. Hartman loses his [[medical license]], and Peter believes himself to be victorious, until he begins needing to [[Prostate Cancer#Symptoms|urinate frequently]]. He is advised to get a prostate exam by Captain Seamus, but [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] thinks that Quahog is not going to trust Peter after that lawsuit...and neither will anyone out of town. Peter finally gives in and goes to see Dr. Hartman, who reveals the problem to just be some swelling (along with Mr. Sulu). Hartman gets his medical license back, and the episode ends in a [[parody]] of ''[[All in the Family]]''.

==Notes==
*Someone other than Chris (Peter) sees the [[Evil Monkey]] (though Peter mistook him for [[Megan Griffin|Meg]]).
*An extended version of the "Mr. Nipple" scene with Peter and Stewie is shown on Adult Swim, where Peter puts his finger in Stewie's mouth, mistaking it for Lois' vagina.
* Stewie and Peter both speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at different times in the show. Stewie says to Brian "te mato perro feo ¿me entiendes estúpido? Tu eres un imbecil, te odio" (I am going to kill you, ugly dog. Do you understand me, stupid? You are an imbecile. I hate you!), and Peter answers "ocupado" (busy) when Chris knocks the bathroom door.
* There is another possible hint towards Stewie being homosexual. When Rupert is ripped up, Stewie envisions them going on a trip to Hawaii but instead of having the body of a teddy bear, Rupert has the appearance of a muscular, attractive man in speedos.
* Stewie brings Lois "two tickets" to see [[Eddie Money]], a possible reference to one of his hit songs "Two Tickets to Paradise".

==Cultural references==
* In the flashback of Peter's passing of his exam, the song "I'm Free (Heaven Helps The Man)" by [[Kenny Loggins]] is played.
* During the flashback of Peter's "rape", he is thrown on a pinball machine.  This is a reference to the rape scene in the movie ''[[The Accused]]''.  Also, the scene in which Peter is pushed onto the grass and a carnival is taking place behind Dr. Hartman is a reference to the film ''[[Dr. Giggles]]''. There is also a ''[[American History X]]'' reference when Hartman spanks and is about to penetrate Peter.
*[[Kermit the Frog]] is shown to be racist in this episode, in a flashback taken from the opening of ''[[The Muppet Movie]]''. He threatens a black man to turn around when the man asks for directions to town, after which he pulls out a [[shotgun]] and cocks it.
*Stewie describes Lois as a female [[Bonnie Hunt]].
* Stewie's explanation for his speaking Spanish is that he fell asleep during ''[[Sábado Gigante]]'', a popular Spanish-language variety television show.
* Stewie testifies against [[Michael Jackson]], a reference to the [[People v. Jackson|2005 molestation trial against him]]. 
* Lois seems to initially reference [[Andrea Yates]] as a parallel to herself, then changes it to imply that [[Barbara Bush]] gave [[George W. Bush]] [[brain damage]] by holding him under water as a child.
* The eponymous characters from ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' become "Dr. Jekyll and [[Hikaru Sulu|Mr. Sulu]]" in a cutaway scene.
* During the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Sulu segment, Mr. Sulu says "Hello" in a suggestive tone and eyes a man passing by, this is a reference to the actor who plays Mr. Sulu, [[George Takei]]'s real life homosexuality
* ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' is referenced twice, once with the aforementioned Mr. Sulu segment and once with a [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. Leonard McCoy]] scene. The [[Star Trek]] franchise had already been spoofed several times by ''Family Guy''. It was notably done in episodes "[[I Never Met the Dead Man]]", "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]" and "[[Peter's Got Woods]]" and the ''Family Guy'' movie ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!]]''.
* The end credits are an animated replication of the ''[[All in the Family]]'' [[end credits]] shot sequence, complete with the use of the actual ''All in the Family'' closing theme and scrolling credits in the show's lettering style.
* When Seamus the old pirate is showing Peter the random posters from his wooden arm, the last picture is of [[Primus (band)|Primus]].  Other posters on his arm include one of [[Middle-earth]], and a "[[Hang in There]]" cat poster.
*Chris mentioning that there is an [[Orange Julius]] at the mall where Peter might find a personal injury lawyer is possibly a reference to ''[[the Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Burns' Heir]]" where lawyer [[Lionel Hutz]] is shown to have a mall office in close proximity to an Orange Julius stand.
* After Lois ignores Stewie's pretended overdose of medication, Stewie asks if this is a "Tommy Lee pool party" referring to the 2001 drowning death of four-year-old [[Tommy_Lee#Solo_career|Daniel Karven-Veres]] at Tommy Lee's Malibu home during a birthday party for his son.
