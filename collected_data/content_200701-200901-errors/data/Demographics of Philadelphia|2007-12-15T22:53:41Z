[[Image:Childrenunder5.jpg|left|thumb|320px|Percent of children under 5 years in Center City and surrounding sections, 2000 Census. Note evidence of childless "[[yuppies]]" in Center City; [[student]]s in [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] and [[Templetown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Templetown]].]]In the city the population was spread out with 25.3% under the age of 18, 11.1% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

The male-female ratio was 86.8, with 46.5% of the population [[male]] and 53.5% [[female]]. Of places with 100,000 or more people, this was the third lowest in the [[United States]]. Only [[Gary, Indiana]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama]] had a higher proportion of women.[http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/cb01cn181.html]

Of housing units, 590,071 (89.1%) were occupied and 71,887 (10.9%) were vacant. Of occupied housing units, 349,633 (59.3%) were owner-occupied and 240,438 (40.7%) were renter-occupied. 

The mean [[commuting|travel time to work]] was 32.0 minutes for workers 16 years of age and older. Residents of [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]] however had much shorter commutes. Center City has the third largest downtown residential population in the country, and most walk to work. 

63.97% of Philadelphians drove an [[automobile]] to work (including [[carpool]]s), 25.93% commuted by [[public transit]], 9.22% walked to work, and 0.88% commuted by [[bicycle]]. 35.74% of households did not have an automobile. The proportion of Philadelphians who do not commute by auto is high compared to most other American cities, although lower than the proportions in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]


==Population history==
[[Image:Philadelphia-Commutetime.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Mean travel time to work, 2000 Census. Note ''1 to 22 minute'' commutes in Center City while some block groups in [[North Philadelphia]] exceed an hour. Low wage service workers commonly travel to the suburbs for employment.]]Throughout the 1700s and early 1800s, the City of Philadelphia was considered the land between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers and between Vine and South Streets. In 1854, the [[Act of Consolidation, 1854|Act of Consolidation]] incorporated the rest of Philadelphia County and created Philadelphia's modern border. This resulted in a large population increase, evident in the 1860 census.

Philadelphia experienced steady growth between 1860 and 1950, except for a brief lull in 1930, which was in part due to the Great Depression. Its population peaked at 2,071,605 in [[1950]]. Between 1950 and 2000, the city lost 554,055 people, or 26.7% of its population. To put this into context, [[Chicago]] lost 20.0% of its population during the same timeframe, and [[Baltimore]] lost 31.4%, according to US Census data. This nationwide trend is often referred to as [[white flight]] because upper and middle class families, enabled by nationwide improvements to infrastructure, left cities in favor of their surrounding suburbs.

Recent estimates predict that the city will experience [[population growth|growth]] slightly before or after 2010. These estimates, and the reasons behind them, are sources of great debate. Possible reasons for the turnaround include increases in immigration from foreign countries and migration from more expensive cities in the [[Northeast Corridor]]. Both wealthy transplants and [[Asian American]] investors from [[New York City]] escaping high housing costs have received media attention for setting their sights on Philadelphia.[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1FFC3A580C778DDDA10894DD404482] The ten-year tax abatement, a historically-undervalued housing market, improvements to the waterfront, and continuing redevelopment throughout the city are thought to be factors drawing people to the city.

==Ethnography==
The ethnic makeup of the city was 32.5% [[African American]], 13.6% [[Irish-American|Irish]], 9.2% [[Italian-American|Italian]], 6.6% [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]], 6.4% [[German-American|German]], 4.3% [[Polish-American|Polish]], 2.9% [[English-American|English]], 1.7% [[Russian-American|Russian]], 1.6% [[Subsaharan Africa]]n, 1.2% [[Chinese-American|Chinese]], and 1.2% [[West Indies|West Indian]]. The city has the second largest [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Italian people|Italian]], and [[Jamaica]]n populations in the US.

The largest concentrations of native-born African Americans are in [[Germantown]], the central, northern, and western neighborhoods of [[North Philadelphia]], the [[Point Breeze, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Point Breeze]] neighborhood of [[South Philadelphia]], parts of [[Southwest Philadelphia]], and most of [[West Philadelphia]]. Large concentrations of Non-Hispanic whites live in [[Center City]], [[Northeast Philadelphia]], and [[Northwest Philadelphia]], although this is changing. [[Gentrification]] is altering the racial demographics of African American neighborhoods close to Center City.

Compared to its [[immigrant]]-magnet peers in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], Philadelphia has long been considered a "black and white" city of mostly native born [[African American]]s and [[White American]]s. However the number of [[Hispanics]] and [[Asian American]]s has increased over the past 20 years and continues to accelerate.

The number of foreign-born increased by 34,000 between 1990 and 2000. Of foreign-born Philadelphians, 38.5% were from Asia, 30.3% were from Europe, 23.4% were from [[Latin America]], and 6.7% were from [[Africa]]. 

[[Image:Philadelphia-Percent Speak a Language Other Than English at Home-2000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|Percent who spoke [[Language Spoken at Home (U.S. Census)|a language other than English at home]], 2000 Census. Notable are [[Chinatown]], [[international student]]s in [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]], and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic Americans]] in eastern [[North Philadelphia]].]]Increases in [[Latino]] immigration and migration have fueled the growth of [[El Centro de Oro]] in [[Fairhill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairhill]]. [[Puerto Rican]]s constitute over 76% of the Latino population in the city and most live in the area that straddles the border between the [[North Philadelphia|North]] and [[Northeast Philadelphia|Northeast]] sections of the city. However, Philadelphia has seen drastic population increases among the Mexican, El Salvadoran, and Guatemalan populations. 
The [[Asian American]] community has long been established in the city's bustling [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Chinatown]] district, but recent [[Vietnamese American]] immigrants have also forged neighborhoods and bazaars alongside the venerable [[Philadelphia Italian market|Italian market]]. [[Korean people|Korean]] immigrants have come to the [[melting pot]] of [[Olney, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Olney]].

[[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants and the [[Italian American]] community are frequently associated with [[South Philadelphia]], including [[Bella Vista, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Bella Vista]], [[Girard Estate, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Girard Estates]], [[Marconi Plaza, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Marconi Plaza]], [[Packer Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Packer Parker]], the [[Italian Market]] area, and many others. There are also many Italian American communities throughout all of Philadelphia, especially the Southwest, North, Northeast, and Northwest sections. 

[[Poles]] and [[Polish Americans]] have a rich history in the [[Port Richmond, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Port Richmond]] area, as well as areas of [[Kensington, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Kensington]] and the Northeast. A large community of [[Irish Americans]] live in North and Northeast Philadelphia neighborhoods, including [[Fishtown]] and [[Kensington, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Kensington]], and in [[Pennsport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsport]] in South Philly. Many other cultures can also be found throughout the city, including [[Sub-saharan Africa]]ns and [[West Indies|West Indians]] in the [[Cedar Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Cedar Park]] neighborhood, and many [[Russians|Russian]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] immigrants in the [[Northeast Philadelphia|Near Northeast]]. 

Recent immigrants from Asia are of mainly [[India]]n, [[Korea]]n, [[China|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Filipino people|Filipino]], [[Cambodia]]n, [[Thai people|Thai]], and [[Pakistan]]i backgrounds. Also, the [[Latino]] population continues to grow as [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]], [[Colombia]]n, [[Brazil]]ian, and [[Cuba|Cuban]] immigrants, as well as  [[Puerto Rican]] citizens emigrate to the city. Philadelphia also has growing populations of [[Ethiopia]]ns, [[Somali people|Somalis]], Jamaicans, [[Haiti]]ans, [[Sudan]]ese, and [[Nigeria]]ns. Philadelphia has one of the most notable African-born populations in the United States, significantly that of Liberians and Nigerians. 

European immigration is also growing, with more [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Polish people|Polish]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] immigrants. Recently thousands of [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] immigrants have come to the city, many of whom are [[Jewish]]. There are other growing nationalities which include [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Croats|Croatian]] and many others.

The city's [[Middle East]]ern population has tripled since 1990, with people of [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[Iraq]]i, [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]], [[Syria]]n, and [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghani]] backgrounds residing in Philadelphia.

==Religion==
Christianity is the dominant religion in the city of Philadelphia. The two largest sects are [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]], which are about equal in size. There is also a significant [[Eastern Orthodox]] population.

Since the early 1800s, there has been a large and significant [[Jewish]] population. Today, the city has one of the largest in America, and unlike many other places, it is continuing to grow as Eastern European Jews immigrate to the city. Historically, many Jewish communities left the city for the suburbs between the 1950s and 2000. A number of former [[synagogue]]s in the city have been converted to [[mosque]]s and [[Baptist]] churches, reflecting this change.[http://www.sacredplaces.org/PSP-InfoClearingHouse/articles/Reuse%20for%20Other%20Religious%20Uses.htm] 

Many new religions have arrived, including [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]]. With immigration from the [[Middle East]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[India]] these two religions have increased their presence. The largest concentrations of these people live in the Northeast and North parts of the city, [[Center City]], [[West Philadelphia]], and sprawling into the nearby suburbs. According to Abdul Rahim Muhammad, director of the Islamic Cultural Preservation and Information Center, 200,000 Muslims live in Philadelphia, and 85% of the Muslim community is [[African American]].[http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/living/religion/14595736.htm]

Smaller religions can also be found in the city. [[Buddhism]] in [[Chinatown]], and Caribbean and African religions in North and West Philadelphia. These numbers are also growing.
