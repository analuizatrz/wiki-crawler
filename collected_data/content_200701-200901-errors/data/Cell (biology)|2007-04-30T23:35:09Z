==Overview==
===Properties of cells===
Each cell is at least some what self-contained and self-maintaining: it can take in nutrients, convert these nutrients into energy, carry out specialized functions, and reproduce as necessary. Each cell stores its own set of instructions for carrying out each of these activities.Cells where is the bases of single cell life form which start the scientific theroies "revalution."

[[Image:Cellsize.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mouse cells grown in a culture dish. These cells grow in large clumps, but each individual cell is about 10 [[micrometre]]s across.]]

==Anatomy of cells==
There are two types of cells: eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms.

===Prokaryotic cells===
{{main|Prokaryote}}
[[Image:Prokaryote cell diagram.svg|thumb|400px|right|Diagram of a typical [[prokaryotic]] cell]]
[[Prokaryote]]s are distinguished from eukaryotes on the basis of nuclear organization, specifically their lack of a nuclear membrane. Prokaryotes also lack most of the intracellular organelles and structures that are characteristic of eukaryotic cells (an important exception is the ribosomes, which are present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells). Most functions of organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and the Golgi apparatus, are taken over by the prokaryotic plasma membrane. Prokaryotic cells have three architectural regions: appendages called [[flagella]] and [[Pilus|pili]] — proteins attached to the cell surface; a [[cell envelope]] consisting of a capsule, a [[cell wall]], and a [[plasma membrane]]; and a [[cytoplasm|cytoplasmic region]] that contains the [[genome|cell genome]] (DNA) and ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. Other differences include:
* The ''plasma membrane'' (a phospholipid bilayer) separates the interior of the cell from its environment and serves as a filter and communications beacon.
* Most prokaryotes have a ''[[cell wall]]'' (some exceptions are ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' (a bacterium) and ''[[Thermoplasma]]'' (an archaeon)). It consists of ''[[peptidoglycan]]'' in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from "exploding" ([[cytolysis]]) from [[osmotic pressure]] against a [[hypotonic]] environment. A cell wall is also present in some eukaryotes like plants (cellulose) and [[fungi]], but has a different chemical composition.
* A prokaryotic chromosome is usually a circular molecule (an exception is that of the bacterium ''Borrelia burgdorferi'', which causes [[Lyme disease]]). Even without a real ''nucleus'', the DNA is condensed in a ''nucleoid''. Prokaryotes can carry [[extrachromosomal DNA]] elements called ''[[plasmid]]s'', which are usually circular. Plasmids can carry additional functions, such as antibiotic resistance.

===Eukaryotic cells===
[[image:Biological cell.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of a typical [[eukaryotic]] cell, showing subcellular components. [[Organelle]]s: (1) [[nucleolus]] (2) [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (3) [[ribosome]] (4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Golgi apparatus]] (7) [[Cytoskeleton]] (8) smooth ER (9) [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[vacuole]] (11) [[cytoplasm]] (12) [[lysosome]] (13) [[centriole]]s]]

[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cells are about 10 times the size of a typical prokaryote and can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. The major difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound compartments in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is the presence of a [[cell nucleus]], a membrane-delineated compartment that houses the eukaryotic cell's DNA. It is this nucleus that gives the eukaryote its name, which means "true nucleus". Other differences include:
* The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present.
* The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called [[chromosome]]s, which are associated with [[histone]] proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the ''[[cell nucleus]]'', separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic [[organelle]]s also contain some DNA.
* Eukaryotes can move using ''cilia'' or ''flagella''. The flagella are more complex than those of prokaryotes.

==Subcellular components==
[[Image:celltypes.png|thumbnail|300px|The cells of eukaryotes (left) and prokaryotes (right).]]

All cells, whether [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]], have a [[cell membrane|membrane]] that envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the [[cell potential|electric potential of the cell]]. Inside the membrane, a [[salt]]y [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess [[DNA]], the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells. This article will list these primary components of the cell, then briefly describe their function.

===Cell membrane: A cell's defining boundary===
{{main|Cell membrane}}

The cytoplasm of a cell is surrounded by a ''plasma membrane''. The plasma membrane in plants and prokaryotes is usually covered by a [[cell wall]]. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a [[lipid bilayer|double layer of lipids]] ([[hydrophobic]] fat-like molecules) and [[hydrophilic]] [[phosphorus]] molecules. Hence, the layer is called a [[phospholipid bilayer]]. It may also be called a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of [[protein]] molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell. The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance ([[molecule]] or [[ion]]) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain [[Receptor (biochemistry)#Transmembrane receptors|receptor]] proteins that allow cells to detect external signalling molecules such as [[hormone]]s.

===Cytoskeleton: A cell's scaffold===
{{main|Cytoskeleton}}

The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during [[endocytosis]], the uptake of external materials by a cell, and [[cytokinesis]], the separation of daughter cells after [[cell division]]; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of [[microfilament]]s, [[intermediate filament]]s and [[microtubule]]s. There is a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michie K, Löwe J |title=Dynamic filaments of the bacterial cytoskeleton |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=75 |issue= |pages=467-92 |year=2006 |pmid=16756499}}</ref>

===Genetic material===
Two different kinds of genetic material exist: [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). Most organisms use DNA for their long-term information storage, but [[RNA virus|some viruses]] (e.g., [[retrovirus]]es) have RNA as their genetic material. The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA sequence. RNA is also used for information transport (e.g., [[mRNA]]) and [[enzyme|enzymatic]] functions (e.g., [[ribosome|ribosomal]] RNA) in organisms that use [[DNA]] for the genetic code itself.

Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial [[chromosome]]) in the [[nucleoid region]] of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different, linear molecules called [[chromosome]]s inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] (see [[endosymbiotic theory]]).

A human cell has genetic material in the nucleus (the [[genome|nuclear genome]]) and in the mitochondria (the [[mitochondrial genome]]). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called chromosomes. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule separate from the nuclear DNA. Although the mitochondrial genome is very small, it codes for some important proteins.

Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called [[transfection]]. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's [[genome]], or stable, if it is.

===Organelles===
{{main|Organelle}}

The human body contains many different [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function. Cells also have a set of "little organs," called [[organelle]]s, that are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions. Membrane-bound organelles are <!--"only" INCORRECT here: misplaced modifier; placed before the prepositional phrase--> found only in eukaryotes.

{|
|-
|
; Cell nucleus (a cell's information center) : The [[cell nucleus]] is the most conspicuous organelle found in a [[eukaryotic]] cell. It houses the cell's [[chromosomes]], and is the place where almost all [[DNA]] replication and [[RNA]] [[synthesis]] occur. The nucleus is spherical in shape and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the [[nuclear envelope]]. The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, [[DNA]] is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]], or copied into a special RNA, called mRNA. This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the [[cytoplasm]].
|[[Image:Diagram human cell nucleus no text.png|300px|Diagram of a cell nucleus]]
|-
| colspan="2" |
; Mitochondria and Chloroplasts (the power generators) : [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are self-replicating organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. As mitochondria contain their own genome that is separate and distinct from the nuclear genome of a cell, they play a critical role in generating energy in the eukaryotic cell, they give the cell energy by the process of respiration, adding [[oxygen]] to food (typicially pertaining to [[glucose]] and [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) to release energy.  Organelles that are modified chloroplasts; they are broadly called [[plastid]]s, and are often involved in storage. Since they contain their own genome, they are thought to have once been separate organisms, which later formed a symbiotic relationship with the cells. Chloroplasts are the counter-part of the mitochondria.  Instead of giving off CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O Plants give off glucose, oxygen, 6 molecules of water (compaired to 12 in respiration) this process is called photosynthesis.
|-
|
; Endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (macromolecule managers) : The [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) is the transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that will float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface, and the smooth ER, which lacks them.  Also the [[Golgi apparatus]]'s ends "pinch" off and become new vacuoles in the animal cell.
|[[Image:Endomembrane system diagram no text nucleus.png|300px|Diagram of an endomembrane system]]
|-
| colspan="2" |
; Ribosomes (the protein production centers in the cell) : The [[ribosome]] is a large complex, composed of many molecules, in prokaryotes only exist floating freely in the cytosol, whereas in eukaryotes they can be found either free or bound to membranes.
|-
| colspan="2" |
; [[Lysosomes]] and [[Peroxisomes]] (of the eukaryotic cell) : The cell could not house such destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system. These organelles are often called a "suicide bag" because of their ability to detonate and destroy the cell.
|-
| colspan="2" |
; Centrosome (the cytoskeleton organiser) : The [[centrosome]] produces the [[microtubules]] of a cell - a key component of the [[cytoskeleton]]. It directs the transport through the [[endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Centrosomes are composed of two [[centrioles]], which separate during [[cell division]] and help in the formation of the [[mitotic spindle]]. A single centrosome is present in the [[animal cell]]s. They are also found in some fungi and algae cells.
|-
| colspan="2" |
; Vacuoles : Vacuoles store food and waste. Some vacuoles store extra water. They are often described as liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably ''[[Amoeba]]'' have contractile vacuoles, which are able to pump water out of the cell if there is too much water.

==Cell functions==
===Cell growth and metabolism===
{{main|Cell growth|Metabolism}}

Between successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism.

Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: [[catabolism]], in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and reducing power, and [[anabolism]], in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions.
Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into a less chemically-complex sugar molecule called [[glucose]]. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), a form of energy, via two different pathways.

The first pathway, [[glycolysis]], requires no oxygen and is referred to as [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]]. Each reaction is designed to produce some hydrogen ions that can then be used to make energy packets (ATP). In prokaryotes, glycolysis is the only method used for converting energy.

The second pathway, called the Krebs cycle, or [[citric acid cycle]], occurs inside the mitochondria and is capable of generating enough ATP to run all the cell functions.

[[Image:Proteinsynthesis.png|frame|300px|An overview of protein synthesis.<br/>Within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the cell (''light blue''), [[gene]]s (DNA, ''dark blue'') are [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[RNA]]. This RNA is then subject to post-transcriptional modification and control, resulting in a mature [[mRNA]] (''red'') that is then transported out of the nucleus and into the [[cytoplasm]] (''peach''), where it undergoes [[translation (genetics)|translation]] into a protein. mRNA is translated by [[ribosome]]s (''purple'') that match the three-base [[codon]]s of the mRNA to the three-base anti-codons of the appropriate [[transfer RNA|tRNA]]. Newly-synthesized proteins (''black'') are often further modified, such as by binding to an effector molecule (''orange''), to become fully active.]]

===Creation of new cells===
{{main|Cell division}}

Cell division involves a single cell (called a ''mother cell'') dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in [[multicellular organism]]s (the growth of [[biological tissue|tissue]]) and to procreation ([[vegetative reproduction]]) in [[unicellular organism]]s.

[[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells divide by [[binary fission]]. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called [[mitosis]], followed by division of the cell, called [[cytokinesis]]. A [[diploid]] cell may also undergo [[meiosis]] to produce haploid cells, usually four. [[Haploid]] cells serve as [[gamete]]s in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.

[[DNA replication]], or the process of duplicating a cell's genome, is required every time a cell divides. Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job.

===Protein synthesis===
{{main|Protein biosynthesis}}

Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called [[ribosome]]s located in the [[cytosol]], where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.

==Origins of cells==
{{main|Origin of life}}

The origin of cells has to do with the origin of life, and was one of the most important steps in evolution of life as we know it. The birth of the cell marked the passage from prebiotic chemistry to biological life.

===Origin of the first cell===
{{tone}}
If life is viewed from the point of view of [[replicator]]s, that is [[DNA]] molecules in the organism, cells satisfy two fundamental conditions: protection from the outside environment and confinement of biochemical activity. The former condition is needed to maintain the fragile [[DNA]] chains stable in a varying and sometimes aggressive environment, and may have been the main reason for which cells evolved. The latter is fundamental for the evolution of [[biological complexity]]. If freely-floating DNA molecules that code for [[enzyme]]s are not enclosed into cells, the enzymes that benefit a given DNA molecule (for example, by producing nucleotides) will automatically benefit the neighbouring DNA molecules. This might be viewed as "[[parasitism]] by default." Therefore the [[natural selection|selection pressure]] on DNA molecules will be much lower, since there is not a definitive advantage for the "lucky" DNA molecule that produces the better enzyme over the others: All molecules in a given neighbourhood are almost equally advantaged.

If all the DNA molecule is enclosed in a cell, then the enzymes coded from the molecule will be kept close to the DNA molecule itself. The DNA molecule will directly enjoy the benefits of the enzymes it codes, and not of others. This means other DNA molecules won't benefit from a positive mutation in a neighbouring molecule: this in turn means that positive mutations give immediate and selective advantage to the replicator bearing it, and not on others. This is thought to have been the one of the main driving force of evolution of life as we know it.
(Note. This is more a metaphor given for simplicity than complete accuracy since the earliest molecules of life, probably up to the stage of cellular life, were most likely [[RNA]] molecules that acted as both replicators and enzymes: see [[RNA world hypothesis]]. However, the core of the reasoning is the same.)

Biochemically, cell-like spheroids formed by [[proteinoid]]s are observed by heating [[amino acid]]s with [[phosphoric acid]] as a catalyst. They bear much of the basic features provided by [[cell membrane]]s. Proteinoid-based protocells enclosing RNA molecules could (but not necessarily should) have been the first cellular life forms on Earth.

Another theory holds that the turbulent shores of the ancient coastal waters may have served as a mammoth laboratory, aiding in the countless experiments necessary to bring about the first cell. Waves breaking on the shore create a delicate foam composed of bubbles. Winds sweeping across the ocean have a tendency to drive things to shore, much like driftwood collecting on the beach. It is possible that organic molecules were concentrated on the shorelines in much the same way. Shallow coastal waters also tend to be warmer, further concentrating the molecules through [[evaporation]]. While bubbles comprised of mostly water tend to burst quickly, oily bubbles happen to be much more stable, lending more time to the particular bubble to perform these crucial experiments. The [[Phospholipid]] is a good example of a common oily compound prevalent in the prebiotic seas. Phospholipids can be constructed in one's mind as a [[hydrophilic]] head on one end, and a [[hydrophobic]] tail on the other. Phospholipids also possess an important characteristic, that is having the function to link together to form a [[Lipid bilayer|bilayer]] membrane. A lipid monolayer bubble can only contain oil, and is therefore not conducive to harbouring water-soluble organic molecules. On the other hand, a lipid bilayer bubble [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/P/Phospholipids.html] can contain water, and was a likely precursor to the modern cell membrane. If a protein came along that increased the integrity of its parent bubble, then that bubble had an advantage, and was placed at the top of the [[natural selection]] waiting list. Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the bubbles burst, releasing the results of the experiment into the surrounding medium. Once enough of the 'right stuff' was released into the medium, the development of the first [[prokaryotes]], [[eukaryotes]], and multi-cellular organisms could be achieved. This theory is expanded upon in the book, ''The Cell: Evolution of the First Organism'' by [[Joseph Panno]] Ph. D.

===Origin of eukaryotic cells===
The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a [[symbiosis|symbiotic community]] of prokaryotic cells. It is almost certain that DNA-bearing organelles like the [[mitochondria]] and the [[chloroplasts]] are what remains of ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]], respectively, where the rest of the cell seems to be derived from an ancestral [[archaea]]n prokaryote cell &ndash; a theory termed the [[endosymbiotic theory]].

There is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the [[hydrogenosome]] predated the origin of [[mitochondria]], or viceversa: see the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] for the origin of eukaryotic cells.

==History==
* 1632 – 1723: [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] teaches himself to grind [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], builds a [[microscope]] and draws [[protozoa]], such as ''[[Vorticella]]'' from rain water, and [[Bacterium|bacteria]] from his own mouth.
* 1665: [[Robert Hooke]] discovers cells in cork, then in living plant tissue using an early microscope.<ref name="Hooke" />
* 1839: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] elucidate the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory.
* The belief that life forms are able to occur spontaneously (''[[Abiogenesis|generatio spontanea]]'') is contradicted by [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822 – 1895) (although [[Francesco Redi]] had performed an experiment in 1668 that suggested the same conclusion).
* [[Rudolph Virchow]] states that cells always emerge from [[cell division]]s (''omnis cellula ex cellula'').
* 1931: [[Ernst Ruska]] builds first [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) at the [[University of Berlin]]. By 1935, he has built an EM with twice the resolution of a light microscope, revealing previously-unresolvable organelles.
* 1953: [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] made their first announcement on the double-[[helix]] structure for DNA on February 28.
* 1981: [[Lynn Margulis]] published ''Symbiosis in Cell Evolution'' detailing the [[endosymbiotic theory]].
