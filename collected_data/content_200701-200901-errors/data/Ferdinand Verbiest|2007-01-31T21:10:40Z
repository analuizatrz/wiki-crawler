Father '''Ferdinand Verbiest''' ([[October 9]] [[1623]] – [[January 28]] [[1688]]) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] in [[China]]. He is known as Nan Huairen (南懷仁) in Chinese.

Born at [[Pittem]] near [[Kortrijk]], Belgium, he studied in [[Leuven]], [[Mechelen]], [[Sevilla]] and [[Rome]]. He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] on [[September 2]] [[1641]]. In [[1658]] he accompanied Father [[Martino Martini]] to [[China]] and reached [[Macao]] in [[1659]]. He led the mission in [[Shanxi]] until [[1660]], when he was called to assist, and later replace, Father [[Adam Schall von Bell]] in Beijing in his work in [[astronomy]]. Beside his work in astronomy, he also experimented with steam. He developed a little steam propeled trolley at around 1670, possibly the first steam powered "car".

He died in [[Beijing]] and his remains were buried near those of [[Matteo Ricci]] on [[March 11]], [[1688]].
