'''Chan Kong-Sang''' (陳港生), also known as '''Jackie Chan Sing Lung''' (陳成龍) or '''Jackie Chan''' [[Silver Bauhinia Star|SBS]], (born on [[April 7]], [[1954]]) is a [[China|Chinese]] [[martial artist]], action star, [[actor]], [[Film director|director]], [[script writer]], [[film producer]], [[singer]] and [[stunt]] performer. 

Chan is one of the best known names in [[kung fu]] and [[action movie]]s worldwide for his [[acrobatics|acrobatic]] [[fighting style]], comic timing, use of props including furniture and other set pieces as [[improvised weapons]] and the performing many of his own stunts. Chan has appeared in over a hundred [[film]]s and is one of the most recognisable Asian [[movie star]]s in the world. He has a star on the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong]] as well as on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

Chan is also a major [[pop star]] in Asia and has released over 100 song titles in 20 albums since 1984. He sings in many different languages including [[English language|English]], [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. He also sings many of the [[Theme music|theme songs]] to his films.

==Biography==
Jackie Chan was born on [[Victoria Peak]], [[Hong Kong]] (now part of [[People's Republic of China]]). Chan is the son of [[Charles Chan|Lee-Lee and Charles Chan]], who emmigrated to [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] in 1960 as [[refugee]]s from the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Prior to leaving China, Lee-Lee and Charles had worked as a maid and butler respectively, for the [[France|French]] [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to [[Hong Kong]], with Chan spending his formative years within the confines of the embassy. Chan's Chinese name at birth was Chan Kong-Sang, meaning "''born in Hong Kong''". 

Before he adopted the Westernized name, "Jacky", and later, "Jackie", he was known by a variety of other nicknames. As he was a heavy baby - 5.5kg (12 lb) at birth, he claims to have spent 12 months in the womb - his mother nicknamed him "Pao Pao" (meaning "Cannonball"). Later, while studying at the Peking Opera School he was known as Yuen Lo, as a mark of respect to his master, Yu Jim-Yuen. 

In his early stuntman and acting career (prior to [[New Fist of Fury]] in 1976) he was known as Chen Yueng Lung (or Chen Yuen Lung). In his autobiography Chan states that he used this name, which is close to his opera brother [[Sammo Hung]]'s opera name, so that he didn't have to put his name on films he wasn't happy with.
He was thereafter known as "Jacky", named by his Australian co-workers when living in Australia in 1976-1977<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,15867297%255E2902,00.html Australian Herald Sun], [[9 July]] [[2005]].</ref>. Working on a building site alongside a labourer named Jack, Chan's co-workers nicknamed him "Little Jack", and later shortened this to Jacky. However, he changed Jacky to Jackie during the filming of "The Big Brawl" and has been known by it ever since. Because his father's family name was originally Fong and was changed only when arriving in Hong Kong, Chan's Chinese name was changed in family records years later to "Fong Si Lung"<ref>''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action'', revised paperback edition, p.354, ISBN 0-345-42913-3; [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117919948?categoryid=31&cs=1&s=h&p=0 Variety Magazine]</ref>.
He has also been listed as "Sing Lung" (meaning "already a dragon" in an attempt to jump out of Bruce Lee's shadow), particularly in relation to his music and it may be no coincidence that his character in the film [[Fearless Hyena]] was called "Shing Lung".

===Early years===
[[Image:youngmaster.jpg|thumb|right|Chan in his earliest [[Golden Harvest]] film [[The Young Master]]]]

Chan was educated at Nan Hua Elementary Academy, but he struggled and his parents felt he didn't fit in at the school, so they sent him to the Chinese Opera Research Institute (1961-1971) and later, due to financial difficulties, they enrolled him at the [[Peking Opera School]]. The enrollment was to last for 10 years, and while there, he was taught skills in acrobatics and kung fu under an extremely strict regime. It was here that Chan joined a number of other students who would become members of the [[Seven Little Fortunes]] (the Opera school's best students), and ultimately his Hong Kong film industry compatriots. They included [[Yuen Wah]], [[Corey Yuen]] (Yuen Kwai) and [[Yuen Qiu]]. He also became close friends with [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]], and the three of them would later come to be known as the ''Three Brothers'' / ''Three Dragons''.

Upon finishing at the Opera school, Chan found it difficult to find work, especially due to the declining popularity of Chinese Opera. After a brief spell living with his parents in Australia, working on building sites, Chan returned to Hong Kong. Like his fellow former students, he found work as a film stuntman on several films including [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[Enter The Dragon]], before ultimately being offered acting roles. Very early in his career, in 1975, he was in an adult comedic film called “All in the Family”. “I had to do anything I could to make a living 31 years ago, but I don't think it's a big deal, even Marlon Brando used to be exposed in his movies,” Chan said. The adult scenes at that time were more conservative than the current films however. This remains the only film he has done so far where no fighting or stunts were involved. Chan got his first international success in 1978, with the film [[Drunken Master]]. The movie depicted [[Wong Fei Hung]], played by Chan, as a young and mischievous rascal instead of the venerable [[Kung fu]] master that other films had represented him as. Together with the on-screen antics and charm of Chan and [[Yuen Siu Tien]] (also known as Simon Yuen), father of renowned martial arts choreographer [[Yuen Woo-ping]], [[Drunken Master]] was a radical film for its time. The film was a success and led the way for other international hits.

===1980s===
Chan married [[Taiwan]]ese actress [[Lin Feng-Jiao]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 林鳳嬌) in 1983 according to his autobiography, but many Asian sources state he was married on [[December 1]], 1982. His official website states that he “has been married to Lin Feng-Jiao since 1982”. [Could it be 14 January 1983 of the Western calendar, i.e. day 1 of month 12 of the previous year in the Chinese (lunar) calendar?] Chan admitted on an interview with Indian Talk Show hostess, [[Simi Garewal]] that he married his wife because she got pregnant before marriage <ref>[http://content.msn.co.in/Entertainment/Bollywood/Bollywood_SantaBanta_050906_1221.htm MSN India on Simi Gatewal's Interview of Jackie Chan], [[5 September]] [[2006]]</ref>. Chan and Lin Feng-Jiao have a son, [[Jaycee Chan]] (aka Jo-Ming), who was born on December 3, 1982, although Chan's autobiography lists his son's birth year as 1984. 

Stated in Jackie Chan's autobiography, 'I am Jackie Chan', two Japanese fans attempted suicide when a Japanese article printed the marriage of Chan and Feng Jiao. One girl drank poison in front of Jackie's manager, Willie Chan, and other JC staff in the JC Studios based in Hong Kong. She was rushed to a hospital and saved. The other, however, threw her body in front of a subway and killed herself. Since then, Jackie has kept his family in the dark and in a recent interview with UK presenters of the Priory Show, Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston in August 2001, when asked if there was a Mrs Chan in his life, he replied 'secret' and nothing more. Taiwanese fans have shown aggression towards Jackie and accuse him of being responsible for Feng Jiao's early retirement.  

Chan's attempts to break into the American movie industry began in the 1980s, appearing in movies like ''[[Battle Creek Brawl]]'', ''[[Cannonball Run]]'', ''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' and ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' in the early [[1980s]].

Between 1983 and 1985, Chan enjoyed his most prolific period of acting alongside his opera school brothers. Just after Hung and Biao had made [[Prodigal Son (film|Prodigal Son]], all three appeared together in Chan's [[Project A]] and the first of Hung's original [[Lucky Stars]] trilogy, [[Winners and Sinners]]. All three films came in 1983. These were followed by [[Wheels on Meals]] in 1984, and the trio were reunited twice more for the Lucky Stars semi-sequels [[My Lucky Stars]] and [[Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars]], both in 1985. Chan appeared once more with Hung in 1985, in [[Heart of Dragon]].
This was something of a golden period for Hong Kong cinema-goers, as three of the nation's most loved stars performed together on screen.
In 1988, the last film to star all three together was released, [[Dragons Forever]]. Although they have expressed an interest in working together again, as a trio, it has yet to occur.

Chan is perhaps best known for performing the majority of his own stunts, which he choreographs along with his stunt team. Around the time of [[Project A]] in 1983, Chan officially formed the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]], allowing him to train and work with a group of trusted martial artists and stuntmen for each of his ensuing movies. Chan stated that this makes it easier to choreograph fight scenes as he already has knowledge of his team's abilities.
He and his team also undertake many of the more dangerous stunts for the other characters in his films. These are usually shot from behind or otherwise obscuring the faces so it is not obvious to the viewer. The dangerous nature of the stunts make it difficult for Chan to get insurance, particularly in the US, where his stunt work is contractually limited.

Chan holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for "Most Stunts By A Living Actor". The record notes that "no insurance company will underwrite Chan's productions, in which he performs all his own stunts"<ref>[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=53682 Guinness World Records official site]</ref>. Chan has been injured a number of times during his stunts, and these are sometimes played amongst the bloopers shown over the closing credits of his later movies. He came closest to death while filming ''[[Armour of God]]'' (1985), when he fell from a tree in a relatively routine stunt and fractured his skull.

He may also hold the record for the most number of takes for a single shot in a film, over 2900, for a complex scene involving a shuttlecock game in the movie [[Dragon Lord]], although this is not recognized by the Guinness World Records. <ref>[http://www.dvdbits.com/reviews.asp?id=3297 www.dvd.bits.com]</ref> <ref>[http://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.11/aid.006349/qx/details.htm www.hkflix.com]</ref>

In his autobiography, Chan says he originally created his screen persona as a reaction to that of the martial artist [[Bruce Lee]], and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee's death (see "[[Bruceploitation]]"). Where Bruce Lee's characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular guys, often at the mercy of friends, girlfriends or families. However, his characters always triumph in the end.

The 80s also saw Chan move away from the traditional [[period piece|period]] kung fu films to films set in a more modern era, with more spectacular stunts.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, as well as continuing with his successful Asian film career, Chan still wanted Hollywood success and was offered two roles that would portray him as a villain, but he declined both of them as he didn't want to risk being typecast for further Hollywood roles. His friend, [[Sylvester Stallone]], offered him the role of the criminal, Simon Phoenix, in the futuristic film [[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]. When he declined the role, it was taken by [[Wesley Snipes]]. He also chose not to play a villain in the film ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' with the role taken by [[Jet Li]]. 

In 1994, [[MTV]] honoured Chan with a lifetime achievement award for his action-oriented movies, and a year later, he made his "official" debut in [[North America]] with a worldwide release of ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'' which was his break into the mainstream Hollywood industry. He has attained the box-office guarantee and [[Cult figure|Cult]] popularity that has so far eluded other Hong Kong movie stars like [[Chow Yun-Fat]] and [[Michelle Yeoh]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. His next big success was the [[buddy cop]] action comedy ''[[Rush Hour (film)|Rush Hour]]'' in [[1998]] opposite [[Chris Tucker]]. He also made a successful [[animated series]] called ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]''.

===2000s===
Chan continued his Hollywood success with ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'', its sequel ''[[Shanghai Knights]]'', and ''[[Rush Hour 2]]''. In 2004 Chan returned to Hong Kong box office success with the films ''[[New Police Story]]'', in which Chan plays a troubled police officer, [[The Myth]] where we see Chan as a modern archaeologist who has dreamt he has been reincarnated from an ancient Chinese Warrior and the recent release [[Rob-B-Hood]], which stars Chan as a criminal who kidnaps a baby. These are examples of Chan's growing wish to play a new style of character and to include more dramatic scenes into his films. Currently Chan is filming the next in the Rush Hour series, [[Rush Hour 3]], which sees Chan and [[Chris Tucker|Tucker]] traveling to [[Paris]]. Then in 2007 he will be starring alongside another [[Cinema of China|Chinese]] action star, [[Jet Li]], in a film that is rumored to be based on the Chinese folk story [[Journey to the West]]. Chan also helped to create a [[PlayStation]] game based on him called [[Jackie Chan Stuntmaster]]. Jackie did the voice over and motion capture for the game.

As well as many on-going projects Chan is also a keen [[philanthropist]] and has worked tirelessly to champion many [[Charitable organization|charity]] works and causes. As a well-respected figure of the Hong Kong entertainment industry, he is often one of the leaders in such works, speaking up for [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] and against [[animal abuse]], as well as promoting disaster relief efforts for flooding in [[mainland China]] and the [[2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami]]. Chan helped raise thousands of US dollars, however this money was later stolen by a third party.{{fact}} In [[June]], [[2006]], he announced that he would donate half of his assets to charity when he dies. He stated that he admired the efforts by [[Warren Buffett]] and [[Bill Gates]] to help those in need.

'''Future Projects'''
Apart from filming Rush Hour 3, he has also planned to star alongside Jet Li for the first time in a movie rumored to be based about the Monkey King, and fittingly, it was confirmed that he will be the voice of Master Monkey, in Dreamworks newest animation called Kung Fu Panda slated to be released early in 2008.

==Trivia==

===Skills===
* While not afraid to do his own stunts, he confesses that, like many, he is afraid of [[hypodermic needle|needles]] and hates receiving injections. Unlike injuries that may come from a failed stunt, with a shot he "knows that it's coming."
* Though Chan's willingness to do his own stunts was originally the trademark feature of his movies, he has sustained various injuries over the years which render him incapable of performing certain stunts. He tries to avoid stunts where he may suffer severe head trauma due to a near fatal incident that occurred while shooting [[Armour of God]]. He has also broken his left ankle so many times, he can no longer rely on it while pushing for a jump and must use his right foot instead. Over the years, he has been forced to use body doubles on various occasions. He has also dislocated his pelvis and broken his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips and sternum, and broken his neck and ribs on numerous occasions while filming.
* His final fight with [[Benny Urquidez]] in ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' is considered to be one of the finest fights of the movie genre.
* He knows [[Kung Fu]], and has trained under GrandMaster Leung Ting in [[Wing Tsun]], as well as numerous other masters in [[Northern Praying Mantis|Tong Long]] (Mantis), [[Bak Mei]] (White Eyebrow), as well as the traditional northern Shaolin Kung Fu he learned in opera school. Jackie has also learned numerous other styles of martial arts to help his screen fighting, including [[Hapkido]], [[Boxing]], [[Judo]], [[Taekwondo]] and [[Hei Long]] (Under Master G.J. Torres). Jackie's personal style is said to be a mixture of Boxing, Wing Chun, Hapkido and Judo. He stated that some of his martial arts training has been attributed to Jin Pal Kim, a Korean hapkido stylist. 

===In the Media===
[[Image:JC Opens Disney HK.jpeg|thumb|Jackie with Disney Favourites]]
* Chan has won several awards including The American Choreography Award and The World Stunt Award, and has a Star on the [[Hollywood]] Walk of Fame, along with several awards from [[Hollywood]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Montreal]] World and Fant-Asia Film Festivals; but he has never won an Oscar. Currently there is a campaign underway to award him an Honorary Lifetime Achievement Academy Award. To support this, everyone is eligible to cast a supporting vote (one time only) at: [http://www.oscarworld.net/awardlobby_read.asp?LobbyId=5516 oscarworld.net].

* Chan appeared with, and was quickly "killed" by [[martial arts]] legend [[Bruce Lee]] in 1973's [[Enter the Dragon]] in a very short scene where Chan plays one of Kahn's guards.
* The character [[Lei Wulong]] from the [[Tekken]] video game series is heavily based on Jackie Chan, due to his looks and similar fighting style. 
* A videogame called [[Jackie Chan Stuntmaster]] for the PlayStation was made, of course with his name. Previously, an NES game called [[Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu]] was released.

* He is the central subject of [[United Kingdom|UK]] band [[Ash (band)|Ash]]'s song [[Kung Fu (song)|''Kung Fu'']], which is used for the end credits of the UK and US versions of ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]''.
* The ''[[Pokémon]]'' [[Hitmonchan]] is named after him (similar in style to how the ''Pokémon'' [[Hitmonlee]] is named after [[Bruce Lee]]).
* He helped to open [[Hong Kong Disneyland Resort]] in [[2005]].
* Chan had planned to star as [[Vin Diesel]]'s role in the movie ''[[The Pacifier]]'', but due to busy arrangements, did not take the role.
* He was asked to play Wah Sing Ku in the [[Mel Gibson]] film ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'', but turned down the part as he would have to play a criminal; Chan often says he doesn't like to play real criminals as it is bad for his image-- although he doesn't mind playing either comical criminals or anti-heroes, as in his newest film [[Rob-B-Hood]]. The part of Wah Sing Ku was later played by [[Jet Li]].
* Although he did not voice the part, a likeness of him appeared in the [[Family Guy]] episode, [[Breaking Out Is Hard to Do]], when [[Peter Griffin]] said, "Oh my god, it's Jackie Chan!" three different times to three different Asian people in Asiantown.
* He has appeared alongside [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in a government advert to combat [[copyright infringement|piracy]]<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6443035544827856436&q=Jackie+Chan  video.google.com].</ref>
*In both the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series of ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', a martial artist named [[Master Roshi]] disguises himself and uses the alias "Jackie Chun" to take part in a few martial arts tournaments to secretly test out the powers and abilities of [[Son Goku (Dragon Ball)|Goku]], the main character of the series.

*In the Internet movie ''The Ultimate Showdown'', a likeness of him fought Shaquille O' Neal, but was defeated by a Care Bear.
*Chan featured in an ad campaign for clothing company, [[Hanes]], to promote their Hanes "Go Tagless" [[T-shirt]]. Chan featured along side other celebrities, which included [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Brian Regan]]
===Trademark===
* After filming ''Cannonball Run'', he continued stuntman/director [[Hal Needham|Hal Needham's]] style of ending each of his movies with a sequence of "[[out-takes]]" being shown. This would sometimes include accidents during filming, as in [[The Young Master]], [[Armour of God]], [[Miracles (film)|Miracles]] etc. This practice became so popular that when a later Chan film was released without any out-takes, the Japanese audience complained in such great numbers that the film was re-released with out-takes added back in.

===Language===
* He sings many of his own movie [[theme music|theme songs]]. Chan has had a fairly successful career as a recording artist (though not as successful as his movie career). The American versions of his movies do not typically feature the original theme songs, something which his fans find rather irritating. Chan was also featured on the [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] soundtracks for the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] movie [[Mulan]], which includes a video on the DVD version.
* Since the early 1990s, Chan has always dubbed his own movies. However, in the 1970s and 80s it was not common practice in Hong Kong for stars to do their own dubbing. For much of the early part of Chan's acting career his voice dubbing was done by a single Cantonese voice-over artist, so although the voice wasn't Chan's it was at least consistent from film to film. Chan is quite fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese and often dubs himself in other languages (such as [[English language|English]]).
* He has named his lack of education his greatest regret in life.

===Other===
*In an interview with the popular Shonen Jump Magazine, [[Akira Toriyama]] stated that his top selling [[manga]] series [[Dragon Ball]] was in part influenced by Jackie Chan's Drunken Master film <ref>[http://www.myfavoritegames.com/dragonball-z/Info/Interviews/Interviews-AkiraToriyama.htm Akira Toriyama Interview]</ref> <ref>[http://www.stormpages.com/kangsworld/AKIRA%20TORI.htm Akira Toriyama Biography]</ref>
*The physical toll he took over the years meant than Chan can not sleep on a normal matress for long hours for fear of aggravating further injuries. Chan has his bed modified so that it is hard and inflexible, and will just sleep on the floor as a make shift bed during some of his trips.
*He owns a pewter-coloured [[Lamborghini Murcielago]] [http://exoticspotter.com/list.php?page=16&batch=bt00035/bt00035_42924.jpg&model=7&make=7&location=all (photograph at exoticspotter.com)].
*He once owned a car tuning business called ''JC Sports'' in Hong Kong.
*Owns a set of Japanese [[daisho]] (matching set of [[katana]] & [[wakizashi]]) hand crafted by renowned swordsmith [[Yoshihara Yoshikazu]] <ref>[http://www.to-ken.com/articles/Yoshiharatradition.htm Yoshiharatradition.htm]</ref>
* He often drives [[Mitsubishi]] cars in his films, as he has held an endorsement deal with the company since 1983, and has hosted the [[charity]] [[celebrity]] support race at the [[Macau Grand Prix]] on numerous occasions. The only time he does not drive a Mitsubishi is [[City Hunter (live action)|City Hunter]], which he drives a [[Mazda RX-7]] modified by his tuning company and [[The Tuxedo]] which he drives a [[BMW Z8]]. His tuning company at the time (JC Sports) even catered mainly for Mitsubishi. 
*For his 2004 film, [[New Police Story]], Chan had a Japanese tuning company commission a modified   [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII]] specially for the film.
*Shortly after filming [[New Police Story]], Jackie reported that he would produce and play [[Yue Fei]] in a biopic about the general’s life. [[Jaycee Chan]], Jackie’s son, will share the role as young Yue Fei. Jackie said, “There's already a rough draft right now, we've even found a co-star. In fact, filming of ‘[[Genghis Khan]]’ is also under consideration, but it must be a good script, because a lot of people have filmed this story, and the story itself is complicated and randomized, so up to now, there isn't a concrete plan yet. And [the script for] ‘Ngok Fei’ is nearly completed." He continues, “I think Yue Fei is a man with great sense of loyalty, so am I. I've been loyal to [[Golden Harvest]], to friends and to my country!" Filming will not begin until Jackie finishes filming several other projects (including [[Rush Hour 3]]), but he is willing to work for reduced pay so he can work with his son. This is because he believes the box office results will be good. However, Director ''Tang Jili'' (唐季礼) says the role of Yue Fei could possibly go to [[Andy Lau]].<ref>[http://www.monkeypeaches.com/0403M.html Jackie Chan And Son Will Portray Yue Fei]</ref><ref>[http://www.jackiechan.cc/newsof2004.htm Jackie Chan Makes Preparation for Yue Fei]</ref>
*In 1998, Chan appeared in a commercial for a [[credit card]] company that was shown in Hong Kong.

==Injury List==
{{cleanup-tone}}
Jackie Chan has been injured on numerous occasions during filming usually from doing his own stunts, and occasionally, these mishaps can be seen as [[bloopers]] during the end credits of his films. Below is a list of documented injuries he had sustained over the course of his acting career.
[[Image:jackiechancomplete123_20070112175020.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Armour of God II: Operation Condor.</small>]]

'''[[The Accidental Spy]]'''   
*Hurt his back. Doctor said that if he had another back injury that Chan could be paralyzed for life.    
*The floor was slippery in the Turkish Bath scene and Jackie Chan fell, hitting his head.   
   
'''[[Armour of God|Armour of God ]]'''   
*Chan and his crew were filming in Yugoslavia and the scene called for him to jump from a wall to a tree branch. The first take went perfectly, but Jackie wasn't satisfied and had wanted to do the scene once more. The second time, his grip on the branch slipped and Jackie fell 40 feet to the ground below. Jackie Chan landed hard on his head, causing part of his skull to crack and shoot up into his brain. He was flown to the hospital and was in surgery 8 hours later. He now has a plastic plug, and a permanent hole in his head. He is also slightly hard of hearing in one ear from that fall.
