'''Straffan''' (''Teach Srafáin'' in [[Irish language|Irish]]) is a village in [[County Kildare]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] situated on the banks of the [[River Liffey]], 25 km upstream of the Irish capital [[Dublin]]. 

With a population, according to the census of 2006, of 439 &ndash; an increase since 2002 of 32.2% &ndash; Straffan is the 31st most populous centre in County Kildare.

Straffan is also an electoral division within [[Celbridge]] Number 1 rural area. At one time a separate [[parish]], it is joined to the parish of Celbridge (RC) and Celbridge and Newcastle (CofI) in the Diocese of Dublin.

Straffan is home to the Kildare Country Club, commonly known as the [[K Club]], and its two championship courses which have staged major international events such as the [[European Open]] (annually since [[1995]]), and the [[Ryder Cup]] tournament between Europe and the USA in [[2006]].

==Contemporary Village==
The contemporary village is concentrated around two crossroads on which are situated a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church and [[Church of Ireland]] respectively. Development evolved through the building of estate houses ([[1880]]), land commission cottages ([[1922]]-39), the Murray local authority cottages ([[1949]]), and five estates around the village, Lodge Park ([[1970]]), Coarse Moor ([[1976]]), The Glebe ([[1985]]), The Beeches ([[2006]]) and Barton Grange ([[2007]]). This is set to increase in pace in the coming years when large housing estates are developed on two allotments to the north of the village. Four developments also took place on the grounds of the K Club in the [[2000]]-04 period, Ryder Cup Village, the Courtyard, Churchfields and Ladycastle. A planning application has been lodged with [[Kildare County Council]] (2007) to develop a separate town to the south west at [[Turnings, County Kildare|Turnings]].

==Location==
Straffan is situated at a particularly low lying point in the Liffey valley and is surrounded by flood meadows along the Liffey and River Morell. Agriculture is important to the local economy. Since the [[1700s]] Straffan farmers have been prominent improving agriculturalists and prominent in the prize lists at events run by the [[Royal Dublin Society]]. The research station for the Agriculture department of [[University College Dublin]] is situated at nearby [[Lyons Hill]]. As with the rest of County Kildare, racehorse breeding and training is a prominent local activity. In the [[1920s]] Straffan Station stud was the leading horse breeding stud in the country when owned by Edward “Cub’ Kennedy.

==Etymology==
The name 'Straffan' has an interesting etymological history. The town is named for St Srafán, whose feast day in the [[Martyrology of Tallaght]] was May 23rd. Straffan was also one of 300 Irish locations accorded its own place-legend in [[Dindshenchas|Dinnshenchas Érenn]] (Metrical (ed. Edward Gwynn 1924) iv, pp328-331). It consisted of a poem [[Lumman Tige Srafain]], about a warrior who possessed a wonderful shield, Lumman of the title, and who, according to the poem, died of his wounds at Tech Srafáin. Two forms of the name cited in the tale, Tech Srafáin and Tige Srafáin, are Middle Irish nominative and genitive case forms. The spelling Strafáin, with a -t-, is unusual. Straphan or Straffan is a shortened anglicised form of the original Irish Teach Srafáin (the initial Str- is the usual development of Irish Sr in English), "teach", meaning house.. 

The second Irish name of the town - "An Cluanini", means "little meadows". The story goes that St. Srafán, upon his arrival to the village, noted the smaller size fields in comparison to those of his native Tallaght and gave the town the name.

[[Dindsenchas|Dinnshenchas Érenn]], probably composed by [[Cináed Ua Hartacáin]] (d975), also selected the nearby [[Lyona Hill|Cnoch Liamhna]] for mention as one of the “assemblies and noted places in Ireland” , an indication of the strength of the local ruling family, the Uí Dúnchada branch of the [[Uí Dúnlainge]] who supplied ten [[kings of Leinster]] from their base on nearby [[Lyons Hill]] between 750-1050.

Sruthán (stream) was mistakenly cited by [[Thomas O'Connor]] in the [[Ordnance Survey]] Letters in 1837.and adopted as the Irish form of Straffan. Seosamh Laoide used it in his list of Irish names of post-offices published in Post-Sheanchas (1905).  An Sruthán gained currency among those involved in the Irish revival and was promoted as name in the local schools. Recent research  by Domhnall mac Gilla Easpaig declares it “completely at odds with the written evidence cited above and with local pronunciation and appears to be no more than an ad hoc explanation of the name by O'Connor's informant.” Sruthán is anglicised struffaun in some parts of the country. One would not expect to find it rendered thus in the Straffan area.”

To add to the confusion the Post Office Guide published by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs 1937 gives the Irish form Cluainíní for Straffan, as cited by Seosamh Laoide.  [[An Comisiún Logainmneacha]] proposed the form Na Cluainíní as the Irish form of Straffan Station in the provisional list of the Irish names of postal towns Ainmneacha Gaeilge na mBailte Poist i gCuige Laighean, Liosta Sealadach (1964). It was changed to Teach Strafan in 1982 Post Office Guide. 

Adding further to the confusion was the anomaly, which was corrected in the last five years, of the road signs on the three major roads leading into the village showing the three different names.

==Places of interest==
Today Straffan contains [[Catholic]] and [[Church of Ireland]] churches, a [[newsagent]], a [[butchers]]', two [[pub]]s, the Straffan Inn and Friel's, a [[gaelic football]] club, a [[soccer club]] and a primary school, Scoil Bhríde (present building constructed in [[1963]]). The heritage of the area is reflected in the fact that fifty sites of archaeological and cultural interest in the locality have been identified and listed for preservation by [[County Kildare|Kildare]] County Council, ranging from an ancient hill fort and round tower to the 1913 Lych Gate to the graveyard which has been adopted as the symbol of the village. Local commercial visitor attractions include the Steam Museum at Lodge Park, a Butterfly farm and Morell Farm (did not open for 2007 season).

===Castles and Houses===
The nearby tower house of [[Castledillon, County Kildare|Castledillon]] passed to the de Hereford and Rochford families (1359) until it too fell into disrepair – now only the foundations remain.

A Wogan family tower house “in the north part of Richardstown townland” described as “a square building about 60 feet in height' by Thomas O’Conor in 1837 is now reduced to a pile of stones and mortar which has obviously been moved from its original location.

Barberstown Castle was more fortunate. Its battlemented keep is a prominent landmark on the [[Celbridge]] to [[Clane]] road, 50 feet at its greatest height with walls four and a half feet thick, two small towers, a 53 step staircase and some evidence of damage in the war of 1641. Originally built by Nicholas Barby in the13th century, it passed to the Penkistons in the 14th century, Suttons in the 15th century, the Gaynors who built the Elizabethan House in the 16th century, to Katherine Dillon and Lord Kingston in the 17th century, [[Bartholmew Van Homreigh]] in the 18th century and Hugh Barton who built the  castle roof and added the Victorian House in the 19th  century. It is now a hotel and wedding venue.
[[Lyons Hill|Lyons]] Castle mentioned in the 1332 Book of Howth when it was burned  by the O’Tooles, passed to the Tyrrell in the 1200s, the Aylmer family in 1271 and to the Lawless family, Barons Cloncurry in 1796 after which they built the nearby house, substantially rebuilt and refurbished by [[Valentine Lawless]], the second Baron Cloncurry 1803-10...
Lodge Park was designed by [[Nathaniel Clements]] for Hugh Henry, a Palladian house unusual for its four wings. The story was already current in the early 19th century that when Henry married the daughter of Earl of Milltown he promised her frontage as long as [[Russborough]].

The townland known variously in the calendar Rolls as Surning, Twinings, Surnyng and eventually known as Turnings passed in to the ownership of Thomas Hall (1406), William Preston (1508), Patrick Sarsfield (ancestor of [[Patrick Sarsfield]] of siege of Limerick fame) (1560), Theophilus Jones (1641) and eventually passed to the Mills family.

Straffan Lodge, described by [[Samuel Lewis]] in 1837 as “the neat residence of Mrs Whitelaw” is noted for its dining room decorated Tudor style with oak panels. Itssingle storey wing was added later.

==Religion==
Local ecclesiastical sites prospered at different times, The medieval parish of Straffan lies on the border of the Diocese of Dublin (boundaries established 1111), to the south of [[Taghadoe, County Kildare|Tagahdoe]] Parish (Teach Tua), bounded on the west by {{Mainham%2C_County_Kildare|Mainham]], south by [[Bodenstown, County Kildare|Bodenstown]] and [[Whitechurch, County Kildare|Whitechurch]], and east by [[Killadoon, County Kildare|Killadoon]] and [[Castledillon, County Kildare|Castledillon]]. Ecclesiastical sources refer to Straphan (Register of the Hospital of St. John the Baptist 1245, the Calendar of Justiciary Rolls 1306 and the Regal Visitation 1530 which describes Straffan as 'a church of the deanery of Saltu Salmonis. In 1541 Straffan was united with Castledillon, Donacumper and Kildrought. 

The last Catholic Parish Priest of [[Castledillon, County Kildare|Castledillon]] died in 1707 after which the parish was joined with Straffan. Straffan parish is now joined to Celbridge.

Straffan’s ruined parish church in the graveyard at the centre of the village can be dated to the 15th century from its distinctive bell cote, and defensive living quarters over the main building in the manner of Oughterard and other local churches. The Church of Ireland (1833) has stained glass windows by [[Alfred Child]] and [[Catherine O’Brien]] and several monuments to the Barton family. It was modeled on churches in France. The Catholic church (1787, rebuilt 1987) was also the site of the national school until 1963. It is part of Straffan’s proud ecumenical tradition that the Catholic community used the Church of Ireland while their own church was undergoing reconstruction.

A well and stone roofed chapel at Ardrass (restored 1898) are associated with St Patrick. The hill was a place of pilgrimage until the 19th century.

[[Castledillon, County Kildare|Castledillon]] , situated on the south bank of the River Liffey opposite Straffan, is an ancient monastic site in tits own right founded by Iollathan of the desert (feast day is listed as 2nd Feb in the Martyrology of Tallaght) and accorded a genealogy which indicated close kinship with the Ui Dunglainge [[kings of Leinster]]. By 1294 the church of Tristeyldelane was described as “not worth the services of chaplains” in the Calendar of Christ Church deeds. The site is now identified by a pile of stones and one headstone, erected in 1758 to the Spellissy family. The Castledillon Friars Stone, probably erected for a 15th century abbot of St Wolstan’s (four miles to the east), remained on the site until removed to the Visitor centre in Kildare town.

==Transport==
===Straffan Rail Tragedy===
Straffan was the scene of a [[Straffan Rail Accident 1853|railway accident]] on [[October 5]] [[1853]] in which 18 people died including four children. It occurred in heavy fog when a goods train ran in to the back of a stalled passenger train at a point 974 yards south of Straffan Station. The goods train smashed the first class carriage, which was driven a quarter of a mile through station. The tragedy was the subject of a poem by Donegal-born poet [[William Allingham]].  It was the [[List of pre-1950 rail accidents|third worst accident]] in rail history to that date.

Straffan station was last used for scheduled services in 1947 and the last special train stopped at Straffan in 1963. Straffan railway station opened on [[1 August]] [[1848]] and finally closed on [[10 November]] [[1947]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Straffan station | work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

===Straffan Steam Museum===
The [[Straffan Steam Museum]] is now housed in a church which once stood in the Inchicore railway works in Dublin. The Museum has a fine collection of models of steam locomotives, including two used in the late 19th century by the Great Northern Railway. It also displays a large selection of steam engines used for industrial propulsion, including a huge beam engine used in the [[Midleton]] whiskey distillery in County Cork, a pumping engine employed in Jameson's distillery in Dublin, and a large beam engine installed in [[Smithwick's brewery]], [[Kilkenny]], in 1847. The Museum is open to visitors from Wednesdays to Sundays during the summer, from 2pm to 6pm.

==History==
The area was ravaged in the wars of 1641-2. The Lords of the Pale who allied with [[Rory O'More]] in1642 included Nicholas Wogan of [[Rathcoffey]] (member of the Council of War),  Andrew Aylmer of [[Donadea]], Nicholas Sutton of [[Barberstown, County Kildare|Barberstown]], John Gaydon of lrishtown (whose estate included the present Straffan), Garret Sutton of Richardstown and James Eustace of [[Clongowes]]. In 1641 [[Lyons Hill|Lyons]] Castle was taken and sacked on the orders of the  new LJs William Parsons and John Borlase and two castles belonging to Edward Tipper of Tipperstown burned

When [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|James Butler, 12th Earl of Ormond]] marched into Kildare in 1642 he burned Lyons, Newcastle and Oughterard on February 1st 1642. 

General [[George Monck]] landed in Dublin in February 1642 for the parliamentarians and camped in Straffan (the horses field at Ardrass is named as his camp). [[Rathcoffey]] was besieged and taken by Monck in June 1642, 70 of the garrison made prisoners and later executed in Dublin. During the campaign Kildare county was burned “for 17 miles in length and 25 in breadth.” [[William Petty]]’s Census of 1659 recorded “Barbiestowne” with 36 people and Straffan with 23 people, surnames among them included Byrne, Kelly, Doyle, Malone and Murphy.

According to depositions taken after the battle of Ovidstown a party of 1798 Rebels met at Straffan Bridge including Patrick O’Connor ‘a lawyer from Straffan’. and s pent some time in stables of Straffan Lodge (June 18). In 1803 Straffan men marched to Dublin to join Emmett’s rebellion, while Barney Daly’s pub in Baronrath was used as a rendez-vous. 

Local landowner [[Valentine Lawless]], later the second Baron Cloncurry, was sworn in to United Irishmen by [[James O’Coigly]]. He was elected colonel of [[United Irishmen]] in Kildare, was the last proprietor of ‘The Press’ (United Irish newspaper) and became the United Irish organiser in London until his arrest and detention in the Tower of London. He was also related to [[Robert Emmet]] and according to Emmet’s biographer Ruan O’Donnell provided a link between 1798 and 1803, waiting in Paris for word of success of the rebellion and was to be member of Emmet government. O’Donnell describes as “disingenuous” Lawless’s 1857 account of how he had pleaded with Emmett not to return to Dublin. The Sammon family form Straffan and the Pitts family from Bishopscourt were listed among the rebels.

On [[22 January]] [[1812]] 100 persons assembled at night with carts for the purpose of retrieving hay which ahd been seized in lieu of rent. Leading to a confrontation during which Patrick King was shot dead. As a result of the incident, a request was made to have the military at Celbridge strengthened. Eventually in 1871 a neo-gothic RIC barracks was built in the village with distinctive gun turrets designed to repel invading [[Fenians]]. The barracks was vacated and passed in to private hands in March 1905.
===War of Independence & The Troubles===
A [[National League]] branch for Celbridge and Straffan was established on Sept 24 1887. Bertram H Barton was a member of the Unionist party and instigator of a sedition charge against the Principal of Ardclough school in 1917. Straffan casualties in the First world war included James Cash, (died May 27, 1918.), D.A. Carden, (September 4, 1915), l Thomas Goucher, (January 22, 1918).  Ronald B.C Kennedy (died of illness August 18, 1917), G Kinahan, (October 14, 1916), William Lawless (September 15, 1917), and Peter McLeish, (January 21, 1918). Francie Sammon was a civilian casualty in the Easter Rising of 1916.

A branch of the [[Irish National Volunteers]] was formed in Straffan in 1914. The St Anne's Brass Band from [[Ardclough]] played at the [[Bodenstown]] commemoration in 1914 at which [[Thomas Clarke]] spoke. In February 1917 a Company was reformed in Straffan and a branch of [[Sinn Féin]] formed in 1918. Volunteers planned to bomb the bridge at Straffan but the plan was aborted. Telephone wires were destroyed at [[Bishopscourt]] and Straffan volunteers took part in the ambush at Stacumny on 5 July 1921. Prominent local volunteers included John Logie, Tom Cornelia, James Travers and John McSweeney. During the Civil war the barnewall homesteasd near the 13th Lock in Lyons was the North Kildare brigade headquarters for the anti-treaty IRA.

On [[22 June]] [[1975]] a local man [[Christopher Phelan]] was murdered when he delayed an attempt to derail a train passing on the main Dublin to Cork railway line by unidentified paramilitaries near [[Baronrath]] bridge. His intervention saved the lives of 200 people on the train as it delayed the detonation of the bomb which blew a 3-foot gap in the track. The incident is the subject of an ongoing investigation into “deniable” British army activities in conjunction with Northern Ireland based paramilitaries.

On [[March 31]] [[1976]] the biggest train robbery in Irish history took place at Wheatfield. Eight men in fluorescent jackets used emergency signals to stop the mail train bound from Cork to Dublin and escaped with £600,000 in small denomination notes. The incident became the centre of a celebrated miscarriage of justice case, known mistakenly as the [[Sallins Train Robbery]] case after the nearest rail station then open, when three men were wrongly convicted of the robbery.

===Straffan Estate and Its Owners===
In 1171 Trachstraphli was granted to Maurice Fitzgerald by [[Richard de Clare]] (Strongbow). In c1185 -1189 Gerald Fitzgerald was accorded “Trachstraphli” in the [[Red Book of the Earls of Kildare]]  (Ed. G. Mac Niocaill, Dublin, 1964). 
In 1288 Sir John Fannyn conveyed  Straffan and Ballespaddagh (Irishtown) to Richard Le Penkiston on a deed witnessed by Richard de la Salle, John Posswick and Nicholas Barby, each of whom gave their names to surrounding townlands, Sealstown (de la Salle), Possextown (Posswick) and Barberstown (Barby). In 1473 Suttons held the land as tenants and the land passed to John Gaydon (1490), Thomas Boules (1653), [[Richard Talbot]] (1679), John White (1691), Robert Delap (1717) and Dublin Banker Hugh Henry who purchased the house for £2,200 in 1731. 

===The Henry Family===
Hugh Henry who was MP for Limavady 1713 and Antrim 1727-43 built a house which resembled Oakley Park in Celbridge. Another Hugh Henry  (a nephew) built Lodge Park in 1775. His son Joseph Henry matriculated from Trinity College at 13, inherited the house in 1749, and became MP for Longford 1761-68, Joseph Henry is featured in many of the caricatures painted by [[William Hogarth]] and on display in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]]. His son John Joseph Henry gave the site for Straffan Catholic church in 1787. At the request of [[Valentine Lawless]], Henry subscribed £500 for defence of Armagh rebel priest [[James O’Coigly]]. In 1801 he married Lady Emily Fitzgerald a daughter of the Duke of Leinster. According to a commentator of the time “owing to his extravagance from one of the richest commoners in Ireland he became so embarrassed that he was obliged to sell Straffan and live abroad. Among other foolish things he built an underground passage from Straffan House to the stables.” A [[Benjamin Hallam]] design for proposed extension to house from 1808 survives, but the house accidentally burned and the Henry family settled in France.

===The Barton Family===
Hugh Barton purchased and built a new house (1828-31, designed by [[Frederick Darley]]) slightly downriver from the Henry’s burned out home. Twenty years later an attic added and a distinctive mansard roof, the stacks raised and embellished in French style. An Italian style campanile tower with gilded vane was added later. The refurbished house was based on a chateau at [[Louveciennes]]. 

Hugh [[Barton]] (1766-1854) was in turn succeeded by Nathaniel Barton (1799-1867), Hugh Lyndoch Barton (1824-1899), Bertram Francis Barton (1830-1904), Bertram Hugh Barton (1858-1927) and Capt Frederick (Derick) Barton (1900-1993).  The first five generations of Bartons owned both the estate at Straffan and the family’s 37-hectacre vineyard in St Julien near the Gironde north of Bordeaux, producers of [[Chateau Leoville-Barton]] and [[Chateau Langoa-Barton]]. On his death Bertram Barton left the Straffan estate to his eldest son Derrick and the Bordeaux estate to his second son Ronald Barton. Anthony Barton moved to [[St Julien]] in 1951 and took over the vineyard on the death of Ronald in 1986. The Barton dynasty is believed to be the longest period of single family ownership of any vineyard in Bordeaux.

==The K Club==
On the death of Bertram Barton in a hunting accident in 1927 the scale of the losses on the estate, £4,000 per year, became apparent. The staff of 50 outdoor and 16 indoor employees was unsustainable. Derrick Barton laid off most of the staff and demolished part of the house before selling the house and estate for £15,000 to motorcycle manufacturer John Ellis in 1949. Derrick Barton moved to Straffan Glebe House for a time. The last five private owners of Straffan House followed in quick succession: car importer [[Stephen O’Flaherty]] (1960), film producer [[Kevin McClory]] (1973), Iranian air force founder and minister in the Shah’s government [[Nadar Djhanbani]] (1977, shortly before the downfall of the Shah’s government and his execution), developer [[Patrick Gallagher]] (1979) and property magnate [[Alan Ferguson]] (1981) who invested £6m in Straffan House but never lived there. 

Entrepreneur [[Michael Smurfit]] who was searching for a suitable old house and estate to develop as a country club recruited [[Ray Carroll]], former manager at the [[Grosvenor Hotel]] in London to help with the task. Carroll recommended Straffan above seven other estates he had examined. In 1988 Straffan house was sold for £7m to the Jefferson Smurfit company for use as a golf course and hotel. A further £35m was spent developing the house as a hotel under a scheme negotiated with the government to produce 200 jobs in return for tax breaks for investors. In 1991 Straffan was opened as a 31-bedroom hotel. In 2004 a wing was added to double the size of the hotel and a granite porch from Ballynegal Co Westmeath used to bring the two wings together. 

Straffan put in its first bid to host the Ryder Cup in 1988, before the course had even been built, for the 1993 event. In 1990 the north course, designed by [[Arnold Palmer]], was completed. Straffan staged the PGA cup in 1991 and Irish professional Championship in 1992. As a result of a £1 million sponsorship offer form the [[Smurfit Group]], the [[European Open]] moved its annual home from [[Walton Heath]] to Straffan in 1995. In 1999 Straffan’s bid for the Ryder Cup was eventually accepted by the European PGA. The tournament, staged in September 2006, proved to be the most profitable in the history of the tournament. The south course was completed in 2003 and used for the European Open of 2004.
In 2002 [[Madison Dearborm]] took over the Jefferson Smurfit corporation and divested itself of the K Club. Michael Smurfit purchased the hotel and estate and acquired a further 80 acres on the opposite side of the river for €115m in 2004, with the support of property developer [[Gerry Gannon]]. To fund this expansion 81 housing units were developed on the course and sold for €2.5m each.

==Sport==

JL Carews played [[Sallins]] In their first match on the same day, February 15 1885, that [[Maurice Davin]]’s first rules of Gaelic football were being agreed by GAA Central Council in Cork. The club’s best period followed their success in the 1966 Intermediate championship when they competed in the Kildare senior championship 1967-79. In that period [[Thomas Walsh]] played senior football for Kildare having won an [[All Ireland under-21 championship|All Ireland under-21]] medal in 1965. 
Currently Straffan has two teams competing in the [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] Senior and Junior Football Leagues.
