With an estimated 3,579,212 [[residents]] in 2006 and a land area of 68,667 square miles (177,847 [[km²]]),<ref name="Oklahoma QuickFacts"/> Oklahoma is the 28th most populous and 20th-largest state. Its name is derived from the [[Choctaw]] words ''okla'' and ''humma'', meaning "red people",<ref name="Oklahoma's Name"/> and is known informally by its nickname, ''The Sooner State.'' Formed from [[Indian Territory]] on [[November 16]], [[1907]], Oklahoma was the 46th state to enter the union. Its citizens are known as ''Oklahomans'', and the state's capital and largest city is [[Oklahoma City]].

A major producer of [[Natural Gas|natural gas]], [[petroleum|oil]] and food, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and [[biotechnology]].<ref name="Oklahoma's Economy 1"/> It has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation, ranking third in [[per capita]] income growth and leading in [[gross domestic product]] growth.<ref name="pci"/><ref name="GDP"/> Oklahoma City and [[Tulsa]] serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly 60 percent of Oklahomans living in their [[metropolitan statistical area]]s.<ref name="metros"/>  The state holds a mixed record in education and healthcare, and its largest universities participate in the [[NCAA]] and [[NAIA]] athletic associations, while two house athletic departments rated among the most successful in American history.<ref name="top sports"/><ref name="OK Education 6"/> 

With small mountain ranges, [[prairie]], and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the [[Great Plains]] and the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]]—a region especially prone to [[severe weather]].<ref name="Oklahoma Terrain"/> With a prevalence of [[Germans|German]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[British people|British]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry, more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, the most of any state.<ref name="languages"/> It is located on a confluence of three major American [[cultural region]]s and historically served as a route for [[cattle drives]], a destination for southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned [[Territories of the United States|territory]] for Native Americans. Part of the [[Bible Belt]], widespread belief in [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christianity]] makes it one of the most politically [[conservative]] states, though voter registration is largest in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name="voters"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Oklahoma'' comes from the [[Choctaw]] phrase ''okla'' ''humma'', literally meaning ''red people''. Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of [[Indian Territory]], in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word ''Indian'', ''okla humma'' was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe the Native American race as a whole. ''Oklahoma'' later became the [[de-facto]] name for [[Oklahoma Territory]], and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to White settlers.<ref name="Oklahoma's Name">{{cite web| title = Chronicles of Oklahoma| first= Muriel | last=Wright | publisher = Oklahoma State University| date = June 1936 | url = http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p156.html | accessdate = 2007-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | year=2007| url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html | title=Oklahoma State History and Information | work=A Look at Oklahoma | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation | accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Merserve | first=John | year=1941 | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html | title=Chief Allen Wright| work=Chronicles of Oklahoma | accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>

Usually, land was allocated to settlers on a first come, first served basis.<ref>{{cite web |year=1999|url=http://aaae.okstate.edu/proceedings/1999/Factors%20Influencing%20Enrollment.doc|title= Factors Influencing Enrollment in Agricultural Education Classes of Native American Students in Oklahoma | publisher= Oklahoma State University| format=DOC |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before it was allowed were said to have been crossing the border ''sooner'', leading to the term ''[[sooners]]'', which eventually became the state's official nickname.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/research/r_virt_landrun5.html|title= Rushes to Statehood | publisher= National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Delegations to make the territory into a state began near the turn of the 20th century, when the Curius Act abolished all tribal jurisdiction in Indian Territory.

The new state became a focal point for the emerging [[oil industry]], as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became known as the "[[Oil Capital of the World]]" for most of the 20th century, and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm#tul| title= Tulsa Area History |publisher= Tulsa County Library| accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> In 1927, Oklahoma businessman [[Cyrus Avery]], known as the "Father of Route 66", began a campaign to create [[Route 66]].

During the 1930s, parts of the state began feeling the consequences of poor farming practices, drought, and high winds. Known as the [[Dust Bowl]], areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, and [[northwestern Oklahoma]] were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States.<ref>{{cite web | date=[[2005-08-05]]|url=http://www.ccccok.org/museum/dustbowl.html|title= 1930s Dust Bowl | publisher= Cimarron County Chamber of Commerce| accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent. In response, dramatic efforts in [[soil conservation|soil]] and [[water conservation]] led to massive flood control systems and dams, creating hundreds of [[reservoirs]] and man-made lakes. By the 1960s, more than 200 man-made lakes had been created, the most in the nation.<ref>{{cite web | year=2007|url=http://www.history.com/states.do?action=detail&state=OK&contentType=State_Generic&contentId=54146|title= History of the States: Oklahoma, The Sooner State | publisher= [[The History Channel]]| accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref><ref name="Oklahoma Terrain"/>

In 1995, Oklahoma City became the scene of one of the worst acts of terrorism ever committed in American history. The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of [[April 19]], [[1995]], in which [[Timothy McVeigh]] and [[Terry Nichols]] detonated an explosive outside of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]], killed 168 people, including 19 children.

The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two year terms. The state has a term limit for its legislature that restricts any one person to a total of twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches.<ref name="Oklahoma Government 2"/><ref>{{cite web | publisher=U. S. Term Limits| accessdate=2007-08-09 | url=http://www.ustl.org/leglong.html| title=Legislative Longevity Limits}}</ref>

Oklahoma's judicial branch consists of the [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]], the [[Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals]], and 77 District Courts that each serves one county. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of [[Impeachment]] and the [[Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary]]. Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases. Judges of those two courts, as well as the Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a [[non-partisan]] retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.<ref name= "Oklahoma Government 2">{{cite web | date=[[2007-06-07]] | publisher=Netstate| accessdate=2007-08-01 | url=http://www.netstate.com/states/government/ok_government.htm| title=Oklahoma State Government}}</ref>
[[Image:Senate chamber.jpg|thumb|right|The Oklahoma Senate chamber houses the operations of the [[Oklahoma Senate]].]]
The executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]], his staff, and other elected officials. The principle head of government, the Governor is the chief executive of the Oklahoma executive branch, serving as the [[ex officio]] [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Oklahoma National Guard]] when not called into [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] use and reserving the power to [[veto]] bills passed through the Legislature. The responsibilities of the Executive branch include submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and ensuring peace within the state is preserved.<ref>{{cite web | date=[[1995-12-01]] | publisher=Governor's Commission| accessdate=2007-08-06 | url=http://www.oklaosf.state.ok.us/osfdocs/gvcmmsh2.html| title=Report of the Governor's Commission on Government Performance}}</ref>

=== Local government ===
The state is divided into 77 [[County (United States)|counties]] that govern locally, each headed by a three member council of elected commissioners, a tax assessor, clerk, [[court clerk]], [[treasurer]], and [[sheriff]].<ref>{{cite web | date=[[2006-01-06]] | publisher=Government of Oklahoma| accessdate=2007-08-01 | url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/county.html| title=List of County Officers}}</ref> While each [[municipality]] operates as a separate and independent local government with legislative and judicial power, county governments maintain jurisdiction over both incorporated cities and non-incorporated areas within their boundaries, but have no legislative or judicial power. Both county and municipal governments collect taxes, employ a separate police force, hold elections, and operate emergency response services within their jurisdiction.<ref name="citygov"/><ref>{{cite news |first=Don|last=Diehl| url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?BRD=2754&dept_id=573976&newsid=18622071&PAG=461&rfi=9| date=[[2007-07-24]]|title= Metro About Jenks population figures . . . doubled in size since 2000 census | publisher= Neighbor Newspapers | accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Other local government units include [[school districts]], technology center districts, community college districts, rural fire departments, rural water districts, and other special use districts.

Thirty-nine Native American tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within designated areas. While [[Indian reservations]] typical in most of the United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the [[United States Congress]] to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert|last=Henry| url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=61934| date=[[1989-03-22]]|title= Oklahoma Attorney General's Opinions: Question Submitted by: The Honorable Enoch Kelly Haney, Oklahoma State Senate| publisher= The Oklahoma State Courts Network | accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Lindsay|last=Robertson|url=http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html| year=2001|title= Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law| publisher= [[University of Oklahoma]]| accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref>

Under Oklahoma law, municipalities are divided into two categories: cities, defined as having more than 1,000 residents, and towns, with under 1,000 residents. Both have [[legislative]], [[judicial]], and public power within their boundaries, but cities can choose between a [[mayor-council]], [[council-manager]], or [[strong mayor]] form of government, while towns operate through an elected officer system.<ref name="citygov">{{cite web |year=2005| url= http://www.odl.state.ok.us/almanac/2005/12-muni.pdf | title=Oklahoma Municipal Government | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Libraries | format=pdf| accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref>
