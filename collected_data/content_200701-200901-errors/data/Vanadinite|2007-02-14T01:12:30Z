'''Vanadinite''' is a [[mineral]] with the formula Pb<sub>5</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl, [[lead]] chlorovanadate.
It is part of a series with two other minerals: [[pyromorphite]] (Pb<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl) and [[mimetite]] (Pb<sub>5</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl).

It has hexagonal crystals, usually prismatic but the crystals are often skeletal or cavernous and it may be found in crusts. It is brittle and has an uneven fracture. The [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]] of vanadinite is 2.75-3 and its [[specific gravity]] is 6.7-7.2. It has a resinous lustre and is coloured yellow, yellowish-brown, reddish-brown or red. It is translucent or opaque.

Vanadinite is not a common mineral, occurring as an alteration product in [[lead]] deposits. It is found in the [[Ural Mountains]], [[Austria]], [[Spain]], [[Scotland]], the [[Transvaal]], [[Morocco]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]] and in the [[United States]] states: [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]] and [[South Dakota]]. It is used as an [[ore]] of [[vanadium]] and to some extent of lead as well. The mineral was first described as a [[chromate]] when it was discovered by [[Andrés Manuel del Río]] in Mexico in [[1801]], as the metal vanadium was not itself discovered until [[1830]].
