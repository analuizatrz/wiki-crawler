[[Image:Toga_Illustration.png|frame|Roman clad in toga]]

The '''toga''' was a distinctive garment of [[Ancient Rome]].  It consisted of a long sash of cloth, on the order of perhaps twenty feet (6 meters) in length.  This sash was wrapped around the body in a particular way and was generally worn over a [[tunic]].  The toga was invariably made of [[wool]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], LLD; William Wayte; G. E.

For most of Rome's history, the toga was a garment worn exclusively by men, while women wore the [[stola]].  [[Roman citizenship|Non-citizens]] were forbidden to wear a toga.
==History==
The toga was the earliest dress clothing of the Romans, a thick woollen cloak worn over a [[loincloth]] or [[apron]]. It was taken off indoors, or when hard at work in the fields, but it was the only decent attire out-of-doors.  (We learn this from the story of [[Cincinnatus]]: he was ploughing in his field when the messengers of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] came to tell him that he had been made [[dictator]], and on seeing them he sent his wife to fetch his toga from the house so that they could be received appropriately.<ref>[[Livy|Livius, Titus]] (ca. [[1st century BCE]]).  "Book III: The Decemvirate", chapter [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026&layout=&loc=3.26 26], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]''.</ref> The truth of the story may be doubtful, but it nevertheless expresses the Roman sentiment on the subject.) A toga was a very popular matter of clothing to the Romans.

As time went on, the garments changed. They adopted the shirt (''tunica'', or in [[Greece|Greek]] [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]) which the [[Greeks]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] wore, made their toga more bulky, and wore it in a looser manner. The result was that it became useless for active pursuits, such as those of war.  Thus, its place was taken by the more handy ''[[sagum]]'' (woolen [[cloak]]) on all military occasions.  In times of peace, too, the toga was eventually superseded by the ''[[laena]]'', ''[[lacerna]]'', ''[[paenula]]'', and other forms of buttoned or closed cloaks.  However, the toga did remain the [[court dress]] of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].<ref>Spart. ''Sever.'' 1, 7.

==Significance==
[[Image:Marcus Aurelius at the British Museum.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Marcus Aurelius]] wearing the toga.]]
The same process that removed the toga from every-day life gave it an increased importance as a ceremonial garment, as is often the case with clothing. As early as the third century B.C., and probably even before, the toga (along with the ''[[calceus]]'') was looked upon as the characteristic badge of [[Roman citizenship]]. It was denied to foreigners,<ref>[[Suetonius|Suetonius Tranquillus, Gaius]] (121 CE).  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#15.2 15.2], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars#Life of Claudius|The Life of Claudius]]''.  "In a case involving citizenship a fruitless dispute arose among the advocates as to whether the defendant ought to make his appearance in the toga or in a Greek mantle..."</ref>, and even to banished Romans,<ref>[[Pliny the Younger|Plinius Caecilius Secundus, Gaius]] (ca. 105 CE).  Line 3, epistle 11, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep4.html book 4], ''Epistulae''.  "''Idem cum Graeco pallio amictus intrasset—carent enim togae iure, quibus aqua et igni interdictum est''..." ("Likewise he would have gone clothed with the Greek garb—for those who have been [[Exsilium|barred from fire and water]] are without the right of a toga...")</ref> and it was worn by [[magistratus|magistrates]] on all occasions as a badge of office. In fact, for a magistrate to appear in a Greek cloak (''[[pallium]]'') and sandals was considered by all, except unconventional folk, as highly improper, if not criminal.<ref>Tullius Cicero, Marcus (63 BC).  [http://www.4literature.net/Cicero/Speech_in_Defence_of_Caius_Rabirius_Po/ ''Pro Rabirio Perduellionis Reo'' ("For Rabirius on a Charge of Treason")].  "Rabirius... was now accused of... wearing the dress of an Egyptian."</ref> [[Augustus]], for instance, was so much incensed at seeing a meeting of citizens without the toga, that, quoting [[Virgil]]'s proud lines, "''Romanos, rerum dominos, gentemque togatam''" ("Romans, lords of the world, the race that wears the toga"), he gave orders to the [[aedile]]s that in the future no one was to appear in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] or [[Circus Maximus|Circus]] without it.<ref name="Suetonius_Augustus_405" />

Because the toga was not worn by soldiers, it was regarded as a sign of peace.  A civilian was sometimes called ''togatus'', "toga-wearer", in contrast to ''sagum''-wearing soldiers.  [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Officiis]]'' contains the phrase ''cedant arma togae'': literally, "let arms yield to the toga", meaning "may peace replace war", or "may [[military]] power yield to [[civilian]] power."  This phrase became the [[motto]] of the [[state|U.S. state]] of [[Wyoming]].

==Varieties==
There were many kinds of toga, each used differently.

*''Toga virilis'' (or ''toga alba'' or ''toga pura''): A plain white toga worn on formal occasions by most Roman men of legal age, generally about fourteen to sixteen years and older.<ref>cf. Mart. viii. 28, 11.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>

*''Toga candida'': "Bright toga"; a toga bleached to a dazzling white by chalk (Isidorus ''Orig.'' xix. 24, 6), worn by candidates for public office.<ref>cf. Polybius, x. 4, 8.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  Thus [[Persius]] speaks of a ''cretata ambitio'', "chalked ambition".  Oddly, this custom appears to have been banned by [[plebiscite]] in 432 BC, but the restriction was never enforced.<ref>Liv. iv. 25, 13.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  The term is the source of the English word ''candidate''.

*''Toga praetexta'': An ordinary white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border.  It was worn by:
**Freeborn boys who had not yet come of age.<ref>Liv. xxiv. 7, 2. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>
**All [[Magistratus Curulis|curule magistrate]]s.<ref>cf. Cic. ''post red. in Sen.'' 5, 12. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref><ref>Zonar. vii. 19.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>
**Ex-curule magistrates and -dictators, upon burial<ref>Liv. xxxiv. 7, 2. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref> and apparently at festivals and other celebrations as well.<ref>cf. Cic. ''Phil.'' ii. 4. 3, 110.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>
**Some priests (e.g., the [[Flamen Dialis]], [[Pontifices]], [[Tresviri Epulones]], the [[augur]]s, and the [[Arval]] brothers).<ref>Liv. xxvii. 8, 8; xxxiii. 42.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>
**During the Empire, the right to wear it was sometimes bestowed as an honor independent of formal rank.
**According to tradition, the [[Kings of Rome]].
:Those with the right to wear a ''toga praetexta'' were sometimes termed ''laticlavius'', "having a broad crimson stripe". It also gave its name to a literary form known as [[praetexta]].
[[Image:Contemporary portrayal of a toga picta.jpg|right|110px|thumb|A contemporary portrayal of a ''toga picta'']]

*''Toga pulla'': Literally just "dark toga".  It was worn mainly by [[mourning|mourner]]s, but could also be worn in times of private danger or public anxiety.  It was sometimes used as a protest of sorts—when Cicero was exiled, the Senate resolved to wear ''togae pullae'' as a demonstration against the decision.<ref>''post red. in Sen.'' 5, 12.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  Magistrates with the right to wear a ''toga praetexta'' wore a simple ''toga pura'' instead of ''pulla''.

*''Toga picta'': This toga, unlike all others, was not just dyed but embroidered and decorated.  It was solid purple, embroidered with gold.  Under the Republic, it was worn by generals in their [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s, and by the [[Praetor Urbanus]] when he rode in the chariot of the Gods into the circus at the [[Ludi Apollinares]].<ref>cf. Liv. v. 41, 2. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  During the Empire, the ''toga picta'' was worn by magistrates giving public [[gladiator]]ial games, and by the [[consul]]s, as well as by the emperor on special occasions.

*''Toga trabea'': According to [[Servius]], there were three different kinds of ''trabea'': one of purple only, for the gods; another of purple and a little white, for kings; and a third, with scarlet stripes and a purple hem,<ref>cf. Isid. ''Orig.'' xix. 24, 8.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref> for augurs and [[Salii]].<ref>''ad Aen.'' vii. 612; cf. ad vii. 188.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] says that those of [[Equites|equestrian]] class wore it as well, but this is not borne out by other evidence.

==Modern usage==
[[Image:TOGA2.JPG|200px|right]]
In several countries, the tradition of the [[toga party]] has become popular in recent decades, generally at institutions of [[tertiary education]], perhaps best illustrated in (if not inspired by) the film [[Animal House]]. This practice trades on the myth of Roman debauchery, and participants dress in togas, which are usually makeshift garments fashioned from bed linen. As such, these "togas" bear little resemblance to the Ancient Roman garment, being both flimsier and scantier.
