The '''Ford Taurus''' is an [[automobile]] manufactured by the [[Ford Motor Company]] in the [[United States]].  Initially a [[front-wheel drive]] [[mid-size car]], it has since evolved into a [[full-size car]] available in front- or [[all-wheel drive]]. Originally introduced in the 1986 model year, it has remained in near continuous production for more than two decades, making it the fourth oldest nameplate that is currently sold in the Ford lineup. Only the [[Ford Ranger|Ranger]], [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]], and [[Ford F-series|F-150]] have been in production longer. Throughout its production run, it had a [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] branded version entitled the [[Mercury Sable|Sable]], as well as a performance variant, the [[Ford Taurus SHO]]. It is currently sold alongside a [[crossover SUV]] variant, the [[Ford Taurus X]].

The original Taurus was a milestone design for Ford and the entire American automotive industry, as well as a very influential vehicle that brought many new features and innovations to the marketplace. <ref name = "Taub" /> Since its launch in 1986, the Taurus has been a strong seller. Ford has sold over 6.7&nbsp;million Tauruses worldwide as of 2007<ref>{{Cite web | last = Mayne | first = Eric | date = [[2005-05-19]] | url = http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0504/19/C01-154989.htm | title = End of Ford Taurus closes era | publisher = The Detroit News | accessdate = 2007-08-22}}</ref>, making it the fifth bestselling North American nameplate in Ford's history;  only the [[Ford F-series|F-150]]<ref>{{Cite web | last = O'Neil | first = Mike| date = | url = http://www.ford-trucks.com/news/idx/12/247/2005/article/01122005 "Ford's F-Series sets industry truck sales records | title = Ford's F-series sets industry sales truck records| publisher = Ford Trucks.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>, [[Ford Escort (North America)|Escort]]<ref>{{Cite web | last = | first = | date = July 21, 2000 | url = http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=5429 | title = Farewell, Ford Escort | publisher = Media.Ford.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>, [[Ford Model T|Model T]] <ref name="ford">{{Cite web | last = O'Neill | first = Mike | date = May 5, 2004 | url = http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=17697 | title = Ford Nameplates join Five Million Club | publisher = Media.Ford.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>, and [[ford Mustang|Mustang]] <ref name = "ford" /> have sold more units.

==1st Generation development==
[[Image:Taurusdesign2.jpg|thumb|right|Taurus clay model along with many of the original design sketches.]]

When Ford set out to develop the Taurus, they employed a strategy of teamwork that would prove revolutionary in the car development process.<ref name = "Taub">{{Cite book | title = Taurus: The Making of the Car That Saved Ford | first = Eric | last = Taub | year = 1991 | month = November | isbn = 0525933727 | publisher = [[E. P. Dutton]]}}</ref> Previously, at both Ford and [[General Motors]], interior and exterior designers worked separately with no input from each other or from engineers. As a result, the interiors and exteriors of many American cars seemed "mismatched".<ref name = "Taub"/> Taurus development started in 1981, using a method similar to that Ford used when developing the [[Ford Escort (North American)|Escort]], in which engineers from all Ford branches worldwide worked together.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Visnic | first = Bill | date = [[1996-03-01]] | publisher = Ward's Autoworld | url = http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_escort_fords_years/ | title = Escort: Ford's 15 years on a learning curve | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> Unlike the Escort, though, the Taurus was developed entirely by American engineers at Ford's headquarters.<ref name = "Taub"/> The new engineering team was assembled by designer [[Jack Telnack]], and was dubbed "Team Taurus".<ref name = "Taub"/>

The Taurus went through many revisions throughout its development. Original prototypes contained a full glass roof similar to that of the [[Subaru SVX]], though it was deemed "too radical" and abandoned.<ref name = "Taub"/> Customer input played an instrumental role in the Taurus' development, as many components including [[radio]]s, [[steering wheel]]s, [[seat]]s, [[wheel]]s, and entire [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] setups were selected by large numbers of average people though a series of surveys conducted by Ford.<ref name = "Taub"/> In addition, Ford disassembled many competing cars such as the [[Toyota Camry]], the [[Honda Accord]], and the more luxurious [[BMW E28|BMW 5 Series]] in order to examine their parts and components.<ref name = "Taub"/>
[[Image:RoboCop.jpg|thumb|The Taurus' design was so ahead of its time, that it was chosen to be used in the film RoboCop, which took place in the year 2000.]]
Ford premiered the Taurus in a resounding way. In mid-1985, Ford gathered executives and the press for the unveiling of the Taurus and Mercury Sable. The event took place at the [[MGM Studios]] Soundstage 85, where ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' had been filmed.<ref name = "Taub" /> The studio was decorated in a space theme, with stars on the walls, [[Unidentified flying object|flying saucer]] decorations, and refreshments served in flying saucer shaped coolers.<ref name = "Taub" /> For the unveiling, "space" music started playing, as projected stars floated around the room in dance floor fashion. The outlines of the cars glowed green through the curtain; as the curtain flew up, strobe lights flashed, highlighting the cars.<ref name = "Taub"/> Many industry journalists, as well as executives at Ford and [[Chrysler]], believed the Taurus was going to be a failure.<ref name = "Taub"/> Chrysler executives believed customers would instead embrace their more conventional [[Dodge Dynasty]] and [[Chrysler New Yorker]].<ref name = "Taub"/> Executives at Ford knew producing the Taurus was a gamble, as they ran the risk of the car being so advanced it would turn off potential customers. As a result, Ford continued to produce the LTD, which the Taurus was designed to replace in 1986.<ref name = "Taub"/> If the Taurus failed, Ford would have to file for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]].<ref name = "Taub"/> The Taurus, however, ended up being a resounding success, selling over a million units in its first generation alone.<ref name = "Taub"/>

===Reception===

After being unveiled in 1985, the Taurus quickly became one of the most anticipated new cars of 1986. <ref name = "Taub" /> Before going on sale, [[Motor Trend]] tested a few Taurus test mules, and praised the cars extensively, even calling them "the shape of tomorrow". <ref>{{Cite journal | last = Hanson | first = John | title = 1986 Ford Taurus: Mule driving FoMoCo's aeroslick 5-passenger sedan: We take what we can get and like it......very much | journal = [[Motor Trend]] | issue = March 1985 | pages = 33-48 | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref> [[Popular Mechanics]] also tested pre-production Tauruses, and gave praised them as well, describing them as a "totally new breed of car" <ref>{{Cite journal | last = Ross | first = Daniel | title = 1986 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable: Ford brings aerodynamics to the heartland with its new family cars | journal = [[Popular Mechanics]] | issue = July 1985 | pages = 71 & 137 | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref> When the Taurus was actually released in 1986, it garnered unanimous critical praise from automotive publications. It went on to win many awards, most notably being named Motor Trend's [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]] for 1986 <ref name = "COTY86">{{Cite journal | last = Hanson | first = John | title = Car of the Year 1986: It is Going To Be a Bull Market For The Ford Taurus | journal = [[Motor Trend]] | issue = February 1986 | pages = 23–36 | accessdate = 2007-08-12}}</ref>, as well as being named on [[Car and Driver]]'s Ten Best List for 1986.
[[Image:TaurusLX.jpg|thumb|left|A 1986 Taurus in the Henry Ford Museum's Showroom of Automotive History exhibit.]]
It was also received very well by the public, as over 200,000 Tauruses were sold for the 1986 model year. <ref name = "Taub" /> Its radical design was noticed by film makers as well, as it was chosen for use in the 1987 film [[RoboCop]]. The film, which takes place in the year [[2000]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], uses the Taurus extensively as the city's police cars. A Taurus LX dressed up as a police car is used extensively by the titular character. The film would turn out to be a large box office success, and helped to give the car publicity. In 1989, the millionth Taurus was sold <ref name = "Taub" /> after only three years in production.

Although it was initially released 22 years ago, the 1986 Taurus continues to receive positive press to this day. It was #6 on [[USA Today]]'s 2007 list of "25 Cars That Made a Difference" <ref>{{Cite web | last =  | first = | date =  | publisher = USA Today | url = http://www.usatoday.com/money/top25-vehicles.htm | title = 25 Cars That Made a Difference | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>, and was named a "Future Classic" by [[Autoblog]] <ref>{{Cite web | last = Roth  | first = Dan | date = Jan 22, 2007 | publisher = Autoblog | url = http://www.autoblog.com/2007/01/22/future-classic-ford-taurus/ | title = Future Classic: Ford Taurus | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>. A 1986 Taurus is also currently featured in the [[Henry Ford Museum]]'s Showroom of Automotive History exhibit, in which it is touted as "one of the two most significant American automobiles of the 1980s", the other being the [[Dodge Caravan]]/[[Plymouth Voyager]]. <ref>{{Cite web | last =  | first = | date =  | publisher = hfmgv.org | url = http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1986/taurus.html | title = The Showroom of Automotive History: The 1986 Taurus | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>

The first-generation Taurus was launched in 1986 to strong fanfare and sales, replacing the slow-selling LTD. Upon the Taurus' debut, Ford was producing a range of rear-wheel drive cars, as [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]] offered more front-wheel drive vehicles. With the introduction of the [[Ford Tempo|Tempo]], Ford had started its own transition to front-wheel drive. 

===Exterior===
The Taurus displayed a rounder shape than its contemporaries, often likened to a '[[jelly bean]]' or 'flying potato',<ref name = "jellybean">{{cite web | last = Schneiderman | first = R.M. | date = [[2006-10-27]] | publisher = Forbes | url = http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2006/10/27/ford-taurus-demise-cx_rs_1027autofacescan01.html | title = Ford Taurus, R.I.P.| accessdate = 2007-06-29}}</ref> inspired by the design of the [[Audi 100#C3, 1983–92|Audi 5000]] and Ford's own Tempo.<ref name = "Taub"/> The aerodynamic design of the Taurus was not purely cosmetic, however. Its aerodynamic shape made the car more fuel efficient, allowing Ford to meet the more stringent [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standards applied by the [[United States]] government.<ref name = "Taub"/> The Taurus' success ultimately led to an American [[automobile design]] revolution; Chrysler and General Motors developed aerodynamic cars in order to capitalize on the Taurus' success.<ref name="Taub"/>

The Taurus is credited to bringing many new design features into the mainstream marketplace. <ref name = "Taub"/> The Taurus used flush aerodynamic composite [[headlights]], and was the first American sedan to do so<ref name = "Taub"/>; The [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII]] was the first American car to use the new lights. <ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | date =  | publisher = Lincoln-club.org | url = http://www.lincoln-club.org/sketch7.html | title = Lincoln Mark VII autosketch| accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref> Originally, the [[NHTSA]] required that all cars sold in the United States use rectangle shaped sealed beam headlights, and Ford had to convince them to change the rule to allow the headlights be any shape, as long as they met federal lighting standards. <ref name = "Taub" /> Also, Instead of a [[grille]], the Taurus had a front panel to adopt a grille-less 'bottom breather' nose, first pioneered by the [[Citroën DS]] in the 1950s. This feature was first objected to by [[Phillip Caldwell]], and as a result, a few Taurus prototypes were built with a black grille in place of the front panel. <ref name = "Taub" /> Jack Telnack eventually convinced Ford's board of directors to vote on whether or not to use the grill-less nose, on which they eventually decided to use on the production version. <ref name = "Taub" /> Despite this, many initial publicity shots of the Taurus showed it with the black front grille. <ref name = "Taub" /> The Taurus' doors flowed up into the roof, and were designed to make the interior air tight, as well as having the door handles and windows flush with the rest of the car. <ref name = "Taub" /> The bumpers on the Taurus were designed to also be incorporated with the rest of the car's design, being flush with the rest of the body. The wheels were also pushed out to the ends of the frame, and were flush with the fender, instead of being recessed into the fender. This not only improved the car's aerodynamics, it improved handling as well. <ref name = "Taub" /> These design features helped to make the Taurus one of the most aerodynamic cars of its time, as it showed to only contain an [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic drag]] radio of .32 <ref name = "Canadian">{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Bill | date =  | publisher = [[Canadian Driver]] | url = http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/bv/86-06taurus.htm | title = CanadianDriver: Motoring Memories - Ford Taurus 1986-2006| accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>, as well as becoming adapted to many other cars, and are still used on nearly all cars today. <ref name = "Taub" />

===Interior===

Along with the exterior of the Taurus, its interior was ahead of its time, and many features originating from it are still used in most cars today. The interior was designed to be extremely user friendly, with all of its controls designed to be recognizable by touch, allowing the driver to operate them without taking their eyes off the road. For example, the switches to the power windows and power locks were designed with one half of the switch raised up, with the other half recessed, in order for its function to be identified by touch. To further enhance this "user friendliness", the [[dashboard]] was designed to have all of the controls in the central area, within reach of the driver. The left side of the dash also curved slightly around the driver, to make controls easily accessible as well as creating a "cockpit" feel. However, it wasn't curved enough to prevent the passenger from easily identifying and using the vehicle's main controls as well.
[[Image:86 Taurus Interior.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of a 1986 Taurus LX equipped with the column mounted shifter and front bench seat configuration.]]
The interior of the Taurus was highly customizable by the buyer to fit their needs, as it had a large number of options, as well as being available in three different configurations. This meant that the interior of the Taurus could be spartan or luxurious, depending on the buyer's choice of options. On models with an [[automatic transmission]], the Taurus' interior was available in three different configurations: It could be ordered with a traditional column mounted shifter and front bench seat, with bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted shifter, or with buckets seats and a console with a column mounted shifter. However, models available with a manual transmission were only available in one configuration: bucket seats with a center console and floor mounted shifter. The interior equipment also depended on model. The most basic model, the L (see below), came standard with just an AM radio and a front cloth bench seat, while the LX, the highest model, came with a large amount of standard equipment. 

The interior received a few major upgrades during the first generation's production run. In 1989, the Taurus got new door panels that had built in armrests and side [[speaker]]s for the stereo. <ref name = "G1">{{cite web | last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = Taurus Car Club of America | url = http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G1/index.html | title = Ford Taurus spotter's guide: First Generation 1986-1991| accessdate = 2008-04-05}}</ref> In 1990, it got a redesigned dashboard. <ref name = "G1" /> This dash was designed similar to the one it replaced, although it had a different placement for the [[radio]], and was designed to be able to contain either [[cupholder]]s or a [[CD player]], depending on the customer's choice of options.  It also received a new steering wheel with an [[airbag]], as Ford was making it standard in all of its cars.

===Models and Engines===
{{main|List of Ford Taurus models#First generation}}
[[Image:89-91 Ford Taurus wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1989-1991 Ford Taurus wagon]]
At its launch, the Taurus was available in four models; the L, the MT-5, the GL, and the LX. The L was the base model, with only the most basic of equipment. The MT-5 was the second model, which was aimed at Japanese imports, as it was only available with a 4 cylinder engine and a manual transmission. The value model was the GL, which contained more equipment than the MT-5 and L, and had such interior upgrades like rear headrests and a folding rear armrest. The LX was the top of the line model, which had the most standard equipment, as well as many features that were unique to this model, such as [[cornering lamp]]s and side body cladding, as well as its own unique seat design. The wagon was offered in the same trim levels in the same order.

In 1988, the MT-5 wagon was dropped due to poor sales, and the MT-5 was dropped altogether in 1989. 1989 also saw the introduction of the [[Ford Taurus SHO|SHO]], although it was generally marketed as and considered a separate model, as opposed to part of the Taurus line.

The MT-5 and L came with a 90&nbsp;horsepower (67&nbsp;kW) 2.5&nbsp;litre ''[[Ford HSC engine|HSC]]'' four-cylinder, although the 140&nbsp;horsepower (104&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;litre [[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]] [[V6 engine|V6]], was  optional on the L and standard on the GL and LX models. The MT-5 was equipped with a five-speed [[manual transmission]], while Vulcan models used a newly-designed four-speed [[Ford AXOD transmission|AXOD]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]], while HSC-equipped cars used the 3-speed [[Ford ATX transmission|ATX]] automatic. Ford's 3.8&nbsp;litre [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex]] [[V6 engine|V6]] was added to the lineup in 1988 as the top of the line engine optional on the LX and GL. Although the power output was rated at the same 140&nbsp;horsepower (104&nbsp;kW) as the 3.0&nbsp;litre engine, this V6 produced 215&nbsp;ft·lbf (291&nbsp;N·m) of [[torque]].

The Taurus received its first cosmetic update in 1992. With the older model facing slumping sales, this new model brought sales back up again, with 410,000 examples sold during 1992. <ref name="det" /> The Taurus was the best-selling car in the United States for every year of this generation. <ref name= "bestselling"/>

=== Exterior ===
The exterior of this generation got completely redesigned from the previous one. Its length was increased by a few inches, and was a couple of hundred pounds heavier than the previous generation. <ref name = "TCCA">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G2/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable Sporrte's Guide: Second Generation (1992-1995) |publisher= |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> Every body panel, save for the roof, was redesigned. However, many of the redesigned components closely resembled that of the previous generation, leading many to falsely believe that this generation is just a face-lift of the previous generation. <ref name = "bestselling" />

The front nose was redesigned with slimmer [[headlight]]s, while retaining the first generation's "bottom breather" nose, albeit in a more aerodynamically efficient design that flowed into the front bumper.  In the rear, it received new taillights that closely resembled those of the previous generation, as well as an entirely new rear clip. The trunk was also redesigned, with a [[spoiler]] being integrated into the trunk lid's design to make the car more aerodynamically efficient.
[[Image:1992-Ford-Taurus-sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1992 Taurus GL with grey bumpers and side trim. In 1993, the aforementioned parts became color keyed.]]
Also with this generation, each model of Taurus received different exterior trim. The lowest level Taurus L had light grey plastic mirrors and window trim, while the bumpers and side trim were also light grey. The GL, the mid priced model, got chrome window trim and body color mirrors, while still retaining the grey bumpers and side trim. The top-of-the-line LX model had its bumpers color keyed, as well as having the grey side trim replaced with color keyed body cladding. 1992 L and GL models could also be ordered with a [[two-tone paint|two-tone]] paint job, in which instead of being grey, the bumpers and side trim were painted a slightly darker shade of the vehicle's body color. <ref name = "TCCA" />  To cut costs, this was discontinued for the 1993 model year, as all models received color keyed trim and bumpers from that year onward. <ref name = "TCCA" />

===Interior===
The interior was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like the previous generation, was designed to be user friendly. Like the previous generation, it had all of the vehicle's main controls located near the left side of the dash, to be within the easy reach of the driver. Also like the previous generation, all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch, and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons by the gauge cluster that allowed the driver to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. The radio was also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from the previous generation, as well as the steering wheel. <ref name = "TCCA" /> The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger's side airbag, a first of its kind. It was optional in 1992, and became standard in 1994, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to have standard dual front airbags. <ref name = "bestselling" />

The seats and door panels were also redesigned. The new door panels contained integrated armrests, with the controls for the power windows and locks mounted flat on its frontal part, allowing the driver to operate them without moving their arm. These switches, along with all of the main controls, would become illuminated when toe headlights were turned on, allowing the driver to easily see them at night. 

Unlike the previous generation, the interior was not as customizable in this generation, and many options that were previously available were cut for 1992. This generation now only used a single seat design shared upon all models (The first generation LX got its own unique seat design), and was only available in two configurations; with a front bench seat and a column mounted shifter, or with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted shifter. The console was a carryover from the previous generation, although it was redesigned for 1993.

For 1992, the Taurus was available in three models; L, GL, and LX. Just like the first generation, the L was the most basic model, the GL was the mid priced value model, and the LX was the most luxurious model. Due to poor sales, the L was dropped after 1992 <ref name = "TCCA" />, leaving the GL as the entry level model. For the 1995 model year, a new SE model was added, intended to be a budget version of the [[Ford Taurus SHO|SHO]]. <ref name = "TCCA" /> It displaced the LX as the top of the line Taurus, and came standard with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted shifter, as well as a rear spoiler borrowed from the SHO. <ref name = "TCCA" /> The SE was never available as a wagon.

The second generation also came in a modified [[Police]] version. A police Taurus was a GL trim with the 3.8&nbsp;litre Essex V6 engine that was slightly different than the regular Essex engine.<ref name = "Engines">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Engine/index.html |title=Ford Taurus engines |publisher = Taurus Car Club of America}}</ref> Output of the police Essex version was 15&nbsp;bhp greater than the standard due to the addition of a dual [[exhaust]] muffler system, similar to that standard on the SHO; a Y-pipe was added after the resonator which allowed for the split to both sides of the rear of the vehicle.<ref name = "Wolfe">{{cite web |url=http://www.denniswolfe.com/Taurus/Police.htm |title=Tauruses serving the community |publisher=Denniswolfe.com/Taurus |publisher=Denniswolfe.com |date= |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> Other changes included a larger [[fuel tank]], stainless steel [[brake line]]s, standard 4-wheel disc [[brake]]s with ABS, a modified front grille fascia that had a slit in it to allow for increased airflow to the radiator, and a calibrated 140&nbsp;mph [[speedometer]].<ref name = "TCCA" /> The Taurus police package didn't prove to be very popular, and it was often strongly outsold by Ford's own [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]].

For 1992, the 2.5&nbsp;litre [[Ford HSC engine|HSC]] four-cylinder was dropped, along with the 3-speed [[Ford ATX transmission|ATX]] automatic transmission. Instead, all Taurus models came standard with the 140&nbsp;horsepower (104&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;litre [[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]] [[V6 engine|V6]], except for the LX wagon that came with a 3.8&nbsp;litre [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex]] [[V6 engine|V6]]. The Essex was optional on all other Taurus models. Every engine in this generation used the four speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AXOD-E|AXOD-E]] transmission, until 1994, when it was replaced by the four speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4S|AX4S]] transmission, which was used for the rest of this generation's production run.

==Third generation development==
[[Image:96-97 Taurus.jpg|thumb|1996 Ford Taurus]]
Development for the third generation Taurus began in the early 90s, and its designers and engineers believed that they were faced with a daunting task; they compared completely redesigning the Taurus to repainting the [[Mona Lisa]]. <ref name="MW">{{cite book|title=Car: A Drama of The American Workplace|first=Mary|last=Walton|year=1997|month=May|publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]| isbn = 0393040801}}</ref><ref name = "bestselling" /> Like the first generation Taurus, the new Taurus was developed by a team effort, in which the exterior and interior designers, engineers, and marketing staff had input on the new car. <ref name = "MW" /> 

Many designs were considered during the development process, from designs that resembled the second generation cars, to more radically styled cars. They eventually decided on a radical new styling scheme based upon oval derived design elements, which would prove to be the car's [[Achilles heel]] in the marketplace. <ref name = "MW" /> Chief designer Jack Telnack, who oversaw the development of the first and second generation Taurus, said that his Taurus was designed the way it was to stand out in the marketplace, and that the use of the oval was becoming the new global design theme for Ford. <ref name = "News96">{{cite journal| last =Sedgwick| first =David| title =Taurus for '96 will dare to stand out in competitive sedan market| journal =[[The Detroit News]]| issue =| pages =1C-2C| accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref> 

Breaking down and testing competing cars, as well as listening to customer input played a large part in the development of the third generation Taurus, just like it did during the development of the first generation. Many competing cars were broken down and extensively tested in order for the Taurus to be designed to be superior to them in terms of comfort, performance, and refinement<ref name = "MW" />; Most notably, the [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Honda Accord]] were extensively tested, and the Taurus' suspension was designed to emulate these cars' ride and handling techniques. <ref name = "RT">{{cite journal| last =Homan| first =Richard| title =Sneak Preview: Whats Hot For 1996 and Beyond| journal =[[Road and Track]]| issue =September 1995| pages =70–80| accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref> Customer input played a large part into the design of the third generation Taurus' interior. The [[dashboard]]'s design originated from a large number of complaints from customers that the previous Taurus' [[radio]] and [[climate control]] modules were cluttered with many small and similar feeling buttons, as well as small graphics, which caused the driver to have to look away from the road to be able to operate them properly. <ref name = "Tribune">{{cite journal| last =Pierson| first =John| title =How Ford Added a Dash of Design To Its New Taurus| journal =[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| issue =| pages =| accessdate = 2008-04-05}}</ref> As a result, a large portion of the third generation's  dash was devoted to the radio and climate control, with each button on these modules containing a unique design, making it easier for the driver to operate the radio and climate control without taking their eyes off the road. This would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Ford Taurus#Third generation (1996-1999)#Interior|Integrated Control Panel]]. <ref name = "Tribune" /> <ref name = "MW" />

Making the new Taurus pleasing to the senses was a reoccurring theme throughout the third generation Taurus' development. <ref name = "MW"/> Ford's engineers specially tuned every panel and component, so that every sound that the Taurus made, from the doors closing to the engine running, was acoustically pleasing. <ref name = "MW" /><ref name = "ovaly">{{cite journal| last =Karr| first =Jeff| title =Balance of Power: America's Most Popular Car Is All New.

===Reception===
[[Image:3rd_Ford_Taurus_sedan_rear.jpg|thumb|left|Controversial oval rear window]]

The third generation Taurus sedan was unveiled at the 1995 [[North American International Auto Show]], and garnered the most attention from journalists and publications than any other car at the show. <ref name = "FREEP">{{cite Journal| last =Adler| first =Adam| title =Ford Competes Strongly for Attention at International Auto Show| journal =[[Detroit Free Press]]| issue =| pages =| accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref> The wagon was unveiled at the 1995 [[Chicago Auto Show]], and garnered similar amounts of attention. <ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | date = February 9, 1995  | publisher = PR newswire | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16437531.html | title = 1996 Ford Taurus and Mercury wagons debut in Chicago.| accessdate = 2008-04-4}}</ref> After their respective unveilings, both vehicles became among the most anticipated new cars of the 1996 model year <ref name = "MW" />, similar to the first generation Taurus.

Reception to the new Taurus by automotive publications was generally positive. [[Road & Track]] gave the Taurus a good review upon its release, and found its handling and refinement impressive. <ref name = "RT" /> Motor Trend also gave the Taurus a positive review, although they found the oval styling awkward upon first glace. However, after getting used to the car's styling, they found it to have many redeeming qualities. <ref name = "ovaly" /> However, unlike the first generation Taurus, it fell short of their Car of the Year award, which was instead won by the [[Dodge Caravan]].

However, consumer reaction was mixed. Ford had hoped the radical redesign would lead to the same success it had with the 1986 Taurus, and even went as far as predicting that the new Taurus would continue the outgoing model's record of selling over 400,000 units a year. <ref name = "ovaly" /> Sales were somewhat slow at first, prompting Ford to add a low priced "G" model mid year 1996. <ref name = "Gen III" /> It managed to keep its position as the best selling car in the United States in 1996, but it fell to #3 in 1997, behind a redesigned [[Toyota Camry]] and the [[Honda Accord]]. <ref name = "bestselling" />

The 1996 model year saw the first complete redesign for the Taurus. 

=== Exterior ===
The exterior of the third generation Taurus was completely redesigned for 1996. It used a controversial new shape that chief designer [[Jack Telnack]] claimed was penned to make the Taurus stand out in to sedan buyers, and compared the current Taurus to the likeness of a pair of [[slipper]]s. <ref name = "News96" /> This shape was based upon that of an [[oval]], which was perhaps inspired by that of Ford's own logo. <ref name = "MW" /> While the previous Taurus used a flat, streamlined shape, this Taurus used a rounded shape similar to that of the [[Chrysler Concorde]]. As this Taurus was aimed at a more mature, affluent customer base<ref name = "News96" />, the exterior of the LX model contained many upscale styling touches. For example, the LX came with chrome alloy wheels, chrome dual exhaust tips, and the "Taurus" badge on the back was written in script, as opposed to the block letters used in previous generations. <ref name = "Gen III" />

[[Image:1998-99 Ford Taurus Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1998–1999 Taurus sedan]]

In 1998, the exterior of the Taurus received a slight redesign to make the shape more mainstream, in order to appeal to a wider customer base. The front [[bumper]] was redesigned to have a full length opening, as well as moving the Ford logo down onto a chrome bar mounted in the grill, similar to that of the third generation [[Ford Taurus SHO|Taurus SHO]]. These years were also fitted with different front turn signal lenses, featuring completely clear lenses and a multi-reflector surface in the rear of the housing, around the bulb. The rear turn signal lenses were also changed from amber to red, to match the rest of the lightbar assembly.<ref name = "Gen III" /><ref name="Consumerguide96">{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1996-to-1999-ford-taurus.htm |title=1996–1999 Ford Taurus Review |publisher=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

===Interior===

The interior was also completely redesigned for the 1996 model year. Like that of the previous two generations, the interior was designed to be user friendly. <ref name = "MW" /> Like that of the first generation, the dashboard wrapped slightly around the driver, and all of the main controls were placed within their reach, and were designed to be recognizable by touch and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. this interior also contained many new innovations. The controls for the [[radio]] and [[climate control]] were combined into an oval shaped "Integrated Control Panel" mounted in the center of the dash, which was created in response to many complaints from Taurus owners that they couldn't easily operate the main controls of the radios and climate control systems without taking their eyes off the road. <ref name = "Tribune" /> Another new innovation was the "Flip-Fold" center console, in which on bench seat equipped cars, the middle section could be transformed into a console; the seat cushion  folded out into a console with a lockable storage bin and [[cupholder]]s, while the seatback folded down to become an armrest. <ref name = "Gen III" /> A traditional center console with a floor mounted shifter was also available. <ref name = "Gen III" />

|image2=[http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G3/stereocomp.jpg "Integrated Control Panel"]}}
This generation's interior wasn't as configurable as that of the first two generations. The G and GL models (see below) were only available with [[steering column]] mounted shifter, along with a cloth front bench seat and the "Flip-Fold" center console. The LX, on the other hand, came standard with bucket seats that could be ordered with either cloth or [[leather]] upholstry, along with a center console and floor mounted shifter. However, a column mounted shifter and a cloth front bench was available as a no-cost option. <ref name = "Gen III" /> In 1999, the interior was again available in three configurations, like that of the first generation Taurus; a front bench seat with a column mounted shifter, front bucket seats with a center console and floor mounted shifter, or front bucket seats with a center console and a column mounted shifter. Each configuration was offered in both Taurus models (see below). <ref name = "Gen III" />

At its launch, the Taurus was available in two models, the GL, which was the entry level/value model, and the LX, which was the top of the line model. <ref name = "Gen III">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G3/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable Spotter's Guide Generation 3 |publisher=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> The GL was basic, and didn't have any optional features, while the LX came with many standard features and was highly configurable. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Options/1996T.html |title=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia (1996 options) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> To close the price gap between the Taurus and the [[Ford Contour]], as well as to increase sales, a entry level G model was added midway into the 1996 model year, which was essentially a slightly discontented GL. <ref name = "Gen III" /> For the 1998 model year, the models of Taurus were completely changed. The G and GL were dropped, and the LX became the entry level/value model. The SE model from 1995 was revived, and it became the top tier model. The SE was offered with two special packages; the Comfort package which added chrome wheels carried over from the LX, automatic climate control, the [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec engine]] (see below), and bucket seats with a center console and a floor mounted shifter, or the Sport package, which contained all of the features in the comfort package, but substituted the chrome wheels for 5 spoke alloy wheels. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Options/1998T.html |title=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia (1998 options) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>

[[Image:Taurus Ghia1.jpg|thumb|left|1997 Australian-market Taurus Ghia]]

As well as being sold in the [[North American]] market, third generation models were sent abroad to [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]], in [[Driving on the left or right|right-hand drive]] configuration. However, this action proved unsuccessful.<ref name = "AU">{{cite web | url = http://glassguide.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/RT/A3099F03533DD3B2CA256D6E001DE35F_Our+Opinion?OpenDocument | title = Ford Taurus Ghia: our opinion | publisher = Glassguide.au | publisher = Glass Guide | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> In these markets, it wore [[Mercury Sable]] [[headlamp]]s and a unique front bumper cover to conform to these countries' regulations regarding [[automotive lighting]]. Australians and New Zealanders tended to stay away from the cars, due to their high price; a well equipped, larger-engined [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Ford Fairmont (Australia)|Ford Fairmont]] cost around the same amount.<ref name = "AU"/> While the Japanese market was offered the station wagon, Australian buyers could only opt for a single-spec sedan, known as the ''Taurus Ghia''.<ref name = "AU"/>

The 1996 model year was the first time that the Taurus did not have an optional engine. The base G and GL had the 3.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Vulcan V6 engine|Vulcan]] [[V6 engine|V6]], which was a carryover from the previous model. The top of the line LX, however, got the new 3.0&nbsp;L [[double overhead cam|DOHC]] [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec 30]] V6, which produced 200 HP and was developed specifically for this model. When Ford rearranged the Taurus models for 1998, the Vulcan became the standard engine, and the Duratec became optional on all models. However, it was only available on the SE for 1999.<ref name = "Gen III">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G3/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable Spotter's Guide Generation 3 |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>  Vulcan equipped models came with the 4 speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4S|AX4S]] transmission, while Duratec equipped models got the 4 speed [[Ford AXOD transmission|AX4N]] transmission. However, some Vulcan equipped models randomly received the AX4N transmission for no apparent reason. <ref name = "trans">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Engine/Trans.html#ax4n |title=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia: Transaxles (AX4N) |work= |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>

The Taurus received another redesign for 2000, which replaced many of the oval derived design elements of the previous model. To reduce the price to keep it competitive, Ford did cost cutting on the car, such as giving the Taurus rear [[drum brake]]s, eliminating the dual [[exhaust]] on the higher end models, and trimming many other small features. 

===Exterior===
[[Image:Ford Taurus (2005) (photograph by Theo, 2006).jpg|thumb|left|In 2004, the Taurus got a new front end, shown here.]]
When the third generation Taurus debuted, it was hurt by criticism by its design, which was formed from oval derived design elements. The design was very controversial, and it strongly limited the appeal of the car. As a result, for the fourth generation Taurus, Ford designed it with a very conservative design in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, this car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, which greatly increased trunk space.<ref name="Consumerguide00">{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2006-ford-taurus.htm |title=2000-2006 Ford Taurus overview |publisher=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> <ref name = "G4">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G4/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable spotter's guide (Generation 4 2000-2007) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> The roof was also raised into a more upright stance to increase headroom, which can be evidenced by the thicker C-pillar and larger area between the tops of the doors and the top of the roof.

The front and rear clips were also redesigned. The Taurus now had the turn signals integrated into the headdlamps, similar to that of the previous generation Sable. The front bumper was also redesigned to include a larger front grill which, like the previous generation, contained a chrome bar running through the middle containing the Ford logo. The rear clip was redesigned with a larger trunk and trunklid, as mentioned above, as well as giving the Taurus two large taillights as opposed to the rear lightbar used in the previous generation cars. Mounted on the trunklid was a large chrome bar containing the Ford logo, like in the front. In 2004, the front clip was slightly redesigned, and the Taurus got a new front bumper and lights. The grille was made smaller, with the chrome bar removed, replaced by just a large Ford logo in the center. The taillights were slightly redesigned, with larger reverse lights, and the chrome bar above the license plate bracket was changed to the body color.

===Interior===
The interior was completely redesigned with a more conservative shape, although some features from the previous cars were carried over. The dashboard was redesigned with a more conservative design that went straight across the front, as opposed to curving around the driver like in the previous generation. The "Integrated Control Panel" was carried over yet redesigned, although it was made in a bigger, square shape, and placed in the center of the dash instead of being tilted toward the driver. The Flip-Fold center console was also carried over from the previous generation, although it was revamped as well. When folded out, it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had revamped cupholders and storage areas. <ref name = "G4" /> Unlike the previous three Tauruses, this one offered rear cupholders that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with. <ref name = "G4" />

This Taurus' interior was available in two configurations; a front bench seat with a column mounted shifter and the Flip-Fold center console, or bucket seats with a traditional console and a floor mounted shifter. The configuration for a steering column mounted shifter and a center console, which made a brief return in 1999, had been dropped. The interior also contained many new safety features; side airbags, tether straps, and a glow in the dark trunk release mounted inside of the trunk. <ref name = "G4" /> This interior also contained a new system which Ford called the "Personal Safety System". This system, at the time of a collision, would detect the driver and passenger's positions, and would inflate the airbags to match, possibly preventing airbag-related injuries. <ref name = "bestselling" /> For 2004, the interior got a minor revision, with a new steering wheel, new gauges, and the addition of a diagnostic center in the gauge cluster, that would tell if there were any problems with the car, as well as average fuel economy. It also was able to perform a "system check" per request of the driver, to make sure that the engine was functioning properly.

[[Image:00-05 Ford Taurus wagon.jpg|thumb|left|2000-2003 Ford Taurus wagon]]
The models were completely rearranged for the 2000 model year. The most basic model was the LX, with the SE as the mid priced model, a new trim named "SES" as the value model, and the SEL as the highest end model, with it slotting just under the [[Mercury Sable]] LS. The SES and LX models were dropped in 2005, leaving the SE as the base model and the SEL as the top of the line model.

The SEL trim line got slightly redesigned for 2003, to give it a more upscale image. Among the changes it got was that it got a new instrument cluster, wheels, as well as the dash getting slightly redesigned, with [[woodgrain]] trim replacing the black trim. It also got woodgrain on the [[steering wheel]] rim and around the [[power window]] switches on the front doors.<ref name = "bestselling" /> Also in 2003, Ford created a Centennial Version Taurus to celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary. This special Taurus included many extras, such as lighter wood trim, special leather seats, [[headlight]]s with black accents, special wheels, a special leather case for the owner's manual, a leather jacket that said "Ford:100 years", a similar [[watch]], and a letter from [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]] Production was limited to 3,000 units.<ref name = "Cent">{{cite web | url = http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specials/Cent.html | title = Centennial Taurus | publisher = Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia | publisher = Taurus Car Club of America | date = [[2007-01-21]] | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref>

For 2003 and 2004, the SES  model received a "Sport" package, which consisted of different rims,  and the Duratec engine standard.  In addition, the exterior of the vehicle received Sport badging on the front quarter-panels, the chrome bar on the grille was changed to the body color,  the interior received two-toned cloth seats, a two-toned dash applique, special "Sport" floor mats, and a leather covered steering wheel. This model was only offered in four colors.

The engines were carried over from the previous generation, with the [[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]] being the only available engine on the LX and SE, producing 155 horsepower and 185 Torque, and as the base engine on the SES. The [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec]] engine was optional on the SES and standard on the SEL, producing 200 horsepower. For 2005, with the LX and SES models being dropped, the Duratec was only available on the SEL, and in 2006 the Duratec was dropped altogether, with the Vulcan becoming the standard and only engine available on the SEL. All models came with the four speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4N|AX4N]] transmission, although a few models up until 2003 received the similar [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4S|AX4S transmission]]. <ref name = "trans" />

==Initial discontinuation and revival==
{{wikinews|Ford Taurus to be revived}}

Taurus sales had slumped significantly in the years prior to its demise, losing significant market share to [[Japan]]ese sedans.<ref name="det"/> Due to waning popularity and customer demand, Ford decided to slowly discontinue the Taurus. Production of the Taurus wagon was discontinued in December 2004 <ref name = "G4" />; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year, and the Taurus became sold exclusively to [[Fleet vehicles|fleets]] in the [[United States]], while still being sold to retail customers in [[Canada]]. Production ended on [[October 27]], [[2006]], as Ford idled the Atlanta plant, as part its ''[[The Way Forward]]'' [[Corporate restructuring|restructuring plan]].

The discontinuation of the Taurus was controversial.

[[MSNBC]] interviewed many Ford workers who felt that Ford unjustly abandoned the car that had done so much to revitalize Ford and the US industry. In an [[October 25]], [[2006]] USA Today editorial, "How Ford starved its Taurus" it was noted that the Japanese stick with their winners and make them better (such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], which has been in continuous production since the 1960s),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.edmunds.com/toyota/corolla/history.html | title = Toyota Corolla history | publisher = Edmunds.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref> while Detroit automakers retires cars or entire division nameplates in search of "the next big thing".<ref>{{cite news | title = How Ford starved its Taurus | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-10-24-ford-taurus_x.htm | publisher = USA Today | date = [[2006-10-25]] | accessdate = 2006-10-25}}</ref>

However, after [[Alan Mulally]] took position as Ford's CEO, rumors were rampant that he was interested in reviving the Taurus. These were fueled by the fact that he said in an interview with the [[Associated Press]] that he was baffled to find out that the Taurus had been discontinued when taking position as CEO at Ford, as well as stating that he believed that discontinuing the Taurus was a mistake, and that the Five Hundred should have been named "Taurus" from the beginning. <ref name = "Alan">{{Cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17033668/ | title = CEO insisted in bringing "Taurus" back | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | date = [[2007-02-07]] | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The rumors of a possible Taurus revival were confirmed in mid 2007, when the revamped versions of the Five Hundred and Freestyle were unveiled as "Taurus" and "Taurus X" at the 2007 [[Chicago Auto Show]], a decision that was influenced strongly by Mulally. <ref name = "Alan" /> In a later interview, Mulally explained that the fact that the Taurus was well known and had a positive brand equity associated with it strongly influenced his decision to revive the name. <ref>{{Cite video | title = Ford CEO Alan Mulally on the new Ford Taurus | publisher = Autoinsider news | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYlNOtqI8tc | date = 2007-07-26]]}}</ref>

As a result, the [[Ford Five Hundred]] sedan, as produced for the 2005–2007 model year, was scheduled for a significant styling facelift update and power upgrade for the 2008 model year. Ford decided to redesignate that model the Taurus because of customer recognition and dealer demand.<ref>{{cite web |title=Five Hundred To Be Renamed Taurus| url=http://www.stangbangers.com/News_FordFiveHundred.htm|publisher=stangbangers.com|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> It was determined that Ford's strategy to redesignate new cars in the lineup with new names beginning with the letter ''F'', as in [[Ford Focus (North America)|Ford Focus]], [[Ford Fusion (North America)|Ford Fusion]], and [[Ford Freestyle]], was not a good marketing move, as some of the renamed cars had highly recognizable iconic names. The new ''F'' names were not as well known to be associated with Ford in the US, and consumers were confused by the name changes.<ref name = "DETROIT" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17003763 |title=Five Hundred to be renamed "Taurus" |publisher=MSNBC.com |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref> Mulally believed that the Taurus had an immediately strong [[brand equity]], and that it would take years for consumers to have a similar recognition of the Five Hundred.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8N48NI80.htm |author=Krisher, Tom |title=Officials say Ford to revive Taurus name |publisher=BusinessWeek.com |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref>

Changes to the new Taurus from the existing Five Hundred include over 500 changes with the most obvious being a newly styled front end and the addition of the 263&nbsp;hp 3.5&nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine|Duratec 35]] V6 which replaces the 203&nbsp;hp [[Ford Mondeo V6 engine|Duratec 30]] 3.0&nbsp;L V6. The Five Hundred/Freestyle's [[List of Ford transmissions|ZF-Batavia]] [[continuously variable transmission|CVT]], which had maximum torque capacity of {{Auto ftlbf|221}}, is also replaced with a [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|Ford-GM joint venture six-speed automatic]] capable of withstanding the Duratec 35s additional torque.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ford slaps a once-successful nameplate on its refreshed and reinvigorated Five Hundred |author=

==Use in NASCAR==
In 1997, the Taurus started to be used in [[NASCAR]] racing, replacing the [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], which had been discontinued after the 1997 model year, The idea or withdrawing the Thunderbird was risky, as the Thunderbirds had won eighteen races in 1997, the model's second-most wins after the twenty-one wins in 1994. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/11/22/ford.timeline/ |title=Ford racing timeline |work=Nascar.com |date=22 September 2006 |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>
[[Image:GregBiffleCar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Greg Biffle]]'s [[National Guard]] sponsored Taurus racing car]]
[[General Motors]] had already used 2-door versions of their [[front-wheel drive]] mid-sizes in NASCAR: the [[Chevrolet Lumina|Chevy Lumina]] and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]], [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Buick Regal]] in NASCAR competition. Since Ford no longer manufactured any 2-door mid-size cars, the 4-door Taurus was chosen, although NASCAR racecars were traditionally based upon two door cars.  

The NASCAR edition of the Taurus was developed by the [[Penske Racing|Penske Racing South]] group based in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]]. The first one was owned by Don Miller, the co-owner and manager of Penske Racing South. <ref name = "CNN" /> The stock car Taurus made its debut to over 300 people, including news media, team representatives, and Ford drivers, on [[July 30]], [[1997]] at the [[Indiana Convention Center]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], right before the Brickyard 400 at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]].<ref name="CNN">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9708/04/nascar.taurus/ |title=Ford takes Taurus to the track |work=CNN.com |date=4 August 1997 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>

The Taurus won fifteen races in the introductory season, nine more than the Thunderbird won in its first five seasons. This success helped to put the Taurus at the top of the NASCAR standings in 1999. <ref name="NASCAR">{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/motorsports/1268761.html?page=1 |title=Under The Skin of a NASCAR Ford Taurus |work=Popular Mechanics |date=March 2000}}</ref> The Taurus would go on to win over 100 races during its NASCAR career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/features/news/detail/index.asp?id=1474 |title=Ford Unveils New Face for the Chase |date=14 July 2005 |accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> The Taurus was eventually retired after the 2005 season, and the Ford NASCAR bodies instead became based upon the Fusion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nascar.com/2005/news/headlines/official/07/14/ford_fusion/index.html |title=Ford unveils Fusion race car for 2006 season |work=NASCAR.com |date=14 July 2005 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>
