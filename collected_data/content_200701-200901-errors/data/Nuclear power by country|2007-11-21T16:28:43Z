[[Image:Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[France]]. France produces 80% of its electricity by nuclear power.<ref name="World Nuclear">[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/reactors.htm World Reactors and Uranium Requirements], [[World Nuclear Association]], URL accessed [[12 June]] [[2006]]</ref>]]<onlyinclude>
'''[[Nuclear power]]''' is a method for [[Electricity generation|generating energy]] by harnessing the [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] of atoms. [[Nuclear fission]] occurs when any fissile material, such as [[uranium-235]], an [[isotope]] of [[uranium]], is concentrated. This causes a [[nuclear chain reaction]], which releases large amounts of heat, boiling water and producing [[steam]], which can drive a [[steam turbine]].</onlyinclude>

Although nuclear power generates many [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatts]] of power, the waste produced and [[Nuclear power#Risks|risks]] often make it a controversial choice. As a result, different nations have very different attitudes towards nuclear power; some, such as [[France]], generate most of their electricity by nuclear power, while others, such as [[Italy]], have [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioned]], or are planning to decommission, all of their nuclear power stations.

In addition to the nations listed below, several other nations, such as [[Australia]], have research reactors, but no plans to diverge into commercial nuclear power; only the commercial reactors registered with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] are listed below. Nations are listed first by number of reactors, then by peak power output in megawatts. Regions in ''italics'' are added for comparison.
