'''The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC)''' is comprised of 21  [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Members of the [[United States Congress]] of [[Hispanic]] descent. The [[Caucus]] is dedicated to voicing and advancing, through the legislative process, issues affecting Hispanics in the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. The CHC was founded in December 1976 as a legislative service organization of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Today, the CHC is organized as a Congressional Member organization, governed under the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives.

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus aims to address national and international issues and the impact these policies have on the Hispanic community. The function of the Caucus is to serve as a forum for the Hispanic Members of Congress to coalesce around a collective legislative agenda. In addition to covering legislative action, the CHC also monitors [[Executive (government)|Executive]] and [[Judicial]] issues.

CHC legislative priorities cover all areas that have a direct impact on the Hispanic community. In order to best address these diverse issues, members work in a smaller [[task force]] that draws on their expertise and develops priority [[legislation]] within each area. The CHC is currently composed entirely of Democrats, although it had been a bipartisan organization since its founding. The Hispanic Republican members decided to break off in 1999, led by the Cuban-American delegation from Florida.  Senator [[Mel Martinez]], and Reps. [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]], [[Mario Diaz-Balart]], [[Devin Nunes]], [[Luis Fortuño]], [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] and [[Trent Franks]] are members of the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]]. Senator [[Bob Menendez]], a Cuban-American Democrat from [[New Jersey]], is a member of Congressional Hispanic Caucus, while Senator [[Ken Salazar]] (D-CO) is not a member of either of these organizations.

==History==
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) was organized in 1976 by five Hispanic Congressmen Herman Badillo (NY), Baltasar Corrada (PR), E. "Kika" de la Garza (TX), Henry B. Gonzalez (TX) and Edward Roybal (CA), to monitor legislative and government activity that affects Hispanics.

The Caucus was originally formed to serve as a legislative organization through which legislative action, as well as executive and judicial actions, could be monitored to ensure the needs of Hispanics were being met. The goal was to work in conjunction with other groups, both inside and outside Congress, to strengthen Federal commitment to Hispanic’s and heighten the community's awareness of the operation and function of the American political system.

In October 1981, the House Committee on House Administration drafted new regulations stipulating fundraising activities were to be move off all government premises. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus decided to maintain a legislative support organization on Capitol Hill, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and moved the non-profit, fund raising organization, today known as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Inc. to a new residence.

==Controversies==
On January 31, 2007, a story on the [[Politico.com]] website reported that Rep. [[Joe Baca]] had called Rep. [[Loretta Sanchez]] a "whore" in a conversation with [[List of Speakers of the California State Assembly|Speaker of the California Assembly]] [[Fabian Núñez]], prompting Sanchez to resign from the CHC.  Rep. Baca has denied this charge, <ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0107/2572.html Sanchez Accuses Democrat of Calling Her a 'Whore,' Resigns from Hispanic Group] at [[Politico.com]] </ref> but two other CHC members, [[Linda Sánchez]] (Loretta's sister) and [[Hilda Solis]], expressed support for Loretta Sanchez. <ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0207/2583.html Two More Reps. Complain About Treatment of Women in Hispanic Caucus] at [[Politico.com]] </ref> In the case of Solis, Baca called her "'a kiss-up' to Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]]", for which he has apologized to Solis both privately and publicly. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/21/AR2007022101772.html Women Call for Change in Caucus] at [[The Washington Post]]</ref>

A year prior to the "whore" incident, The CHC's [[Political action committee]] gave $3,000 to Joe Baca's children's campaigns for state offices in California. Although Baca recused himself from the decision to make the contributions, six members of the caucus criticized the decision, saying that CHC's PAC should support only federal candidates. Consequently, on [[November 15]], [[2006]], when Joe Baca was elected chair of the CHC, Solis and the Sanchez sisters challenged his election, saying that the voting should have been done by a secret ballot. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/21/AR2007022101772.html Women Call for Change in Caucus] at [[The Washington Post]]</ref>

On Monday, [[April 2]], [[2007]], Congresswoman [[Linda Sánchez]] closed her offices in honor of [[César Estrada Chávez]] Day, a State holiday in California (which fell on a Saturday that year). CHC chair Baca made the following comment on Sánchez's decision to close the office "I believe the best way to observe César Estrada Chávez Day is not by taking the day off from work or school".<ref>[http://thehill.com/in-the-know/rep.-baca-wags-finger-at-sanchez-for-closing-office-for-cesar-chavez-day-2007-04-03.html Rep. Baca wags finger at Sanchez for closing office for César Chávez Day] at [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]</ref>. On [[April 12]], Linda Sánchez announced that she has "suspended her membership in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, citing a need for 'structural reforms to ensure that the caucus is more equitable and inclusive of all its members'". She specifically stated that her decision "was not based on personal animus directed at Baca." <ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0407/3514.html Linda Sanchez Leaves Hispanic Caucus] at [[Politico.com]]</ref>
