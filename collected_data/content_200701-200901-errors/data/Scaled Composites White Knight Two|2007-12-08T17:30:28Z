[[Scaled Composites]]' '''White Knight Two''' or '''Eve''' is the first stage of [[Tier 1b]], a two-stage to suborbital-space manned launch system. It is coupled with [[SpaceShipTwo]] to form the full launch package. WK2 is based on the successful  mothership to [[SpaceShipOne]], which itself is based on [[Scaled Composites Proteus|Proteus]]. Together WK2 and SS2 form the basis for [[Virgin Galactic]]'s fleet of suborbital spaceplanes.

==Design==
[[Image:SpaceShipOne WhiteKnight.jpg|thumb|White Knight Two is based upon the first [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]]]]
White Knight Two will be roughly three times larger than White Knight, in order to perform a [[captive carry]] with the larger SpaceShipTwo spacecraft. The WK2 will be similar in [[wingspan]] to a [[B29|B29 bomber]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/943/1 |title=Something dangerous and new |accessdate=2007-08-28 |date=August 28 2007 |publisher=thespacereview.com}}</ref> and will be by far the largest aircraft constructed by Scaled Composites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2006/03/07/205290/ss2-white-knight-2-to-use-common-fuselage.html |title=SS2, White Knight 2 to use common fuselage |accessdate=2007-08-25 |date=March 7 2006 |publisher=flightglobal }}</ref>

WK2 will be an [[aerobatic]] airplane, and will provide preview flights offering several seconds of [[weightlessness]], before the actual suborbital event. It will have a [[service ceiling]] of about 60,000 ft or 18km, offering a dark blue sky to passengers. This would allow tourists to practice before the real flight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/news/060811_rutan_interview.html |title=Burt Rutan on Civilian Spaceflight, Breakthroughs, and Inside SpaceShipTwo |accessdate=2007-08-25 |date=11 August 2006 |author=Leonard David |publisher=Space.com }}</ref>

White Knight Two will have a [[twin boom]] with two [[jet engine]]s per hull.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kenny Kemp |title=Destination Space |year=March 2007 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] }}</ref> One hull will be an exact replica of that of SpaceShipTwo (to allow tourist training), and the other will carry cut-rate day-trippers into the stratosphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/space/magazine/15-06/ff_space_virgin |title=Burt Rutan and Richard Branson Want You to Hit Space in High Style |accessdate=2007-08-25 |date=May 22, 2007 |author= Spencer Reiss |publisher=Wired.com }}</ref>

==Commercial introduction==
The White Knight Two design is expected to be revealed on January 23, 2008. Construction of the first aircraft is due to complete in June 2008 with the first test flight in July 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/12/07/220152/virgin-galactic-sets-out-year-of-the-spaceship.html |title=Virgin Galactic sets out Year of the Spaceship |accessdate=2007-12-08 |date=December 7, 2007 |author=Rob Coppinger |publisher=Flight International}}</ref>
