'''''Dreamgirls'''''  is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[United States|American]] [[musical film]] jointly produced and released by [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film debuted in three special [[road show]] engagements beginning [[December 15]], [[2006]], with a nationwide release on [[December 25]], [[2006]] and a [[home video]] release on [[May 1]], [[2007]]. ''Dreamgirls'' won three awards at the [[64th Golden Globe Awards]] ceremony in 2007, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Picture - Musical or Comedy]], and won two [[Oscars]] at the [[79th Academy Awards]].

A [[period piece]] set in the 1960s and 1970s with a primarily [[African-American]] cast, ''Dreamgirls'' is [[film adaptation|adapted]] from the [[1981]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[Dreamgirls|of the same name]]. The musical was loosely based on the history and evolution of American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music during the eras of [[doo-wop]], [[soul music|soul]], the [[Motown Sound]], [[funk]], and [[disco]].''Dreamgirls'' contains several allusions to the lives and careers of [[Motown Records]] act [[The Supremes]], a connection the film version expands upon.<ref>(Feb 2, 2007). "[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2003605,00.html I literally pinch myself every day]." ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 2007-02-27.</ref> ''Dreamgirls'' follows the lives of three women — Effie White, Deena Jones, and Lorrell Robinson - members of an R&B singing group called "The Dreamettes".  With the help of Curtis Taylor, Jr., manager and record label executive, they become famous as the backing group for soul singer James "Thunder" Early. Conflict arises when Curtis transforms "The Dreamettes" into the [[pop music|pop]]-friendly "Dreams," particularly when he has Deena replace Effie as both lead singer of the group and as his romantic interest.

The film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'', which had been in development at various times during the 1980s and 1990s, stars [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Beyoncé Knowles]], and [[Eddie Murphy]]. The film also features [[Danny Glover]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Anika Noni Rose]], [[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]], [[Sharon Leal]], and [[Hinton Battle]]. Produced by [[Laurence Mark]], ''Dreamgirls'' was written and directed for the screen by [[Bill Condon]], screenwriter of the Academy Award-winning film adaptation of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', working from the original Broadway book by [[Tom Eyen]] and the Broadway songs by Eyen and [[Henry Krieger]]. Jennifer Hudson, an ''[[American Idol]]'' alumnus who made her film debut in ''Dreamgirls'', won the 2007 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her portrayal of Effie White.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
As in the original stage musical, ''Dreamgirls'' is broken up into two acts: the first taking place from 1962 to 1965, and the second taking place from 1973 to 1975.

[[Image:Dreamgirls-film-01.jpg|300px|thumb|left|(left to right) C.C. ([[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]]), Lorrell ([[Anika Noni Rose]]), Deena ([[Beyoncé Knowles]]), and Effie ([[Jennifer Hudson]]) in a backstage scene from ''Dreamgirls''.]]
===Act I===
In 1962 [[Detroit, Michigan]], an amateur African-American girl group known as "The Dreamettes" enters a talent competition at the Detroit Theater. Backstage, the three girls — lead singer Effie White ([[Jennifer Hudson]]), Deena Jones ([[Beyoncé Knowles]]) and Lorrell Robinson ([[Anika Noni Rose]]) — meet Curtis Taylor, Jr. ([[Jamie Foxx]]), an ambitious [[Cadillac]] dealer with plans of breaking into the music business. Placing himself as their manager, Curtis arranges for the Dreamettes to tour as backup for [[chitlin' circuit]] R&B star James "Thunder" Early ([[Eddie Murphy]]), by striking a deal with Marty ([[Danny Glover]]), Jimmy's manager.

Hoping to help Jimmy and the girls cross over to mainstream audiences, Curtis starts Rainbow Records (''"The Sound of Tomorrow"''), a record label based in his car dealership's office. He then makes Effie's brother, C.C. ([[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]]), his head songwriter. When Rainbow's first single fails after a white pop group releases a cover version, Curtis, his sidekick Wayne ([[Hinton Battle]]), and C.C. turn to [[payola]]. By paying the right people they manage to get Jimmy and the Dreamettes to the top of the charts and into gigs at both the [[Apollo Theater]] and high-end [[supper club]]s. Offstage, Effie quickly becomes infatuated with the slick-talking Curtis while Jimmy, a married man, begins an adulterous affair with an equally lovesick Lorrell.

Marty grows weary of Curtis's plans to make Jimmy's image and sound more pop-friendly and eventually walks out on Jimmy. However, when Jimmy bombs in front of an all-white [[Miami Beach]] supper club audience, Curtis shifts his attention back to the Dreamettes. Feeling that Effie's voice is too "special" (read: black) and her figure too large to attract white audiences, Curtis appoints the slimmer and softer-voiced Deena as the lead singer of the Dreamettes.

With the aid of new songs and a more glamorous image, Curtis and C.C. transform The Dreamettes into ''The Dreams'', a top selling pop act whose popularity comes to rival that of [[The Beatles]] by 1965, with their first single being [[Dreamgirls (song)|Dreamgirls]]. However, the betrayed Effie does not take kindly to being reduced to Deena's backup and begins acting out when Curtis's affections also turn towards Deena.  Effie misses rehearsals for the Dreams' [[Las Vegas]] debut in order to visit a clinic, where she learns she is pregnant. Once Effie makes it to Las Vegas she finds that Curtis has replaced her with Rainbow's secretary, Michelle Morris ([[Sharon Leal]]). Despite her emotional appeal to Curtis, Effie is left behind as ''Deena Jones & the Dreams'' - as the group is now known - push on without her.

===Act II===
Eight years later, Effie is a depressed [[welfare]] mother and her career in music is over due to [[alcoholism]]. She and her eight-year-old daughter Magic ([[Mariah I. Wilson]]) live alone in the burnt-out inner city of 1973 Detroit with only Effie's father Ronald ([[Alexander Folk]]) to look in on them. On the other hand, Rainbow Records has moved to [[Los Angeles]] where it prospers with Deena Jones & the Dreams and many other pop acts. Wanting to expand his empire into film, Curtis plans to have an unwilling Deena, now his wife, star in a [[blaxploitation]] musical version of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''. Hoping that the struggling film project will never get off the ground, Deena begins secretly meeting with other studios to take a part in another film.

Though still part of the Rainbow roster, Jimmy Early's star has long faded, and Curtis has little interest in revitalizing his career. Unsatisfied with both his wife Melba ([[Dawnn Lewis]]) and his long-term mistress Lorrell, Jimmy turns to drugs for affection. Meanwhile, C.C. continues to reach out to Effie, who stubbornly ignores the letters and money he sends. Eventually, Effie swallows her pride and, with Marty as her manager, returns to singing and secures gigs at a small Detroit club run by Max Washington ([[Ken Page (actor)|Ken Page]]).

In 1974, Rainbow Records hosts a tenth anniversary TV special. Midway through his set, Jimmy breaks down onstage and launches into a wild [[James Brown]]-esque [[funk]] number, dropping his pants on live TV. Curtis resultantly terminates Jimmy's contract, and Lorrell, weary of their eight-year affair, leaves Jimmy behind as well. Some time later, Jimmy dies of a [[heroin]] overdose.

Angry over Jimmy's death and frustrated with Curtis's attempts to "drain the soul" out of his music to create a "new sound" ([[disco]]), C.C. walks out on Rainbow Records and heads back to Detroit to find Effie. The two siblings reconcile at a [[wake (ceremony)|wake]] for Jimmy and work together to produce Effie's comeback single, "One Night Only". Just as the record begins gaining radio play in Detroit, however, Curtis strikes. Using payola, he forces radio DJs to play a disco cover of "One Night Only" by Deena Jones & the Dreams instead of Effie's original.

Curtis has also learned of Deena's covert meetings with other film producers and asserts his control over his wife. Rebuffed, Deena sneaks into Curtis' office, where she discovers evidence of Curtis' payola schemes and finds a copy of Effie's version of "One Night Only". She calls Effie and C.C., who arrive at the Rainbow offices with Marty and a lawyer. As Deena and Effie reconcile, Curtis works out a deal with the lawyer to avoid being reported to the [[FBI]] for payola: Rainbow Records will fund a new label for C.C., which will allow Effie's record national distribution. Curtis then confronts Deena only to find that Effie's victory has inspired Deena to leave him and make it on her own.

As a result, Deena Jones & the Dreams give a farewell performance at the Detroit Theater. At the conclusion of the concert, Effie joins Deena, Lorrell, and Michelle onstage and the reunited Dreams give one final performance of their signature song, "Dreamgirls", with Effie singing lead. As the concert ends, Curtis notices Magic in the front row and realizes that he is the girl's father.

==Production history==
[[Image:Dreamgirls-film-02.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Eddie Murphy]] as R&B star James "Thunder" Early.]]
===Pre-production===
Since the 1980s, several different attempts have been made to produce a film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'', a Broadway musical loosely based upon the story of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]] which won six [[Tony Awards]] in 1982. [[David Geffen]], the stage musical's co-financier, retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'' and turned down many offers to adapt the story for the screen. He cited a need to preserve the integrity of ''Dreamgirls'' stage director [[Michael Bennett]]'s work after his 1987 death.<ref name="DavidGeffen">Marr, Melissa (Dec 8, 2006). "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06342/744656-254.stm After 'Dreamgirls', Geffen says goodbye to movies]". ''The Wall-Street Journal''. Retrieved on December 9, 2006 </ref> In 1987, Geffen, who ran his [[Warner Bros.]]-associated [[Geffen Pictures]] film production company at the time, began talks with Broadway lyricist and producer [[Howard Ashman]] to adapt it as a star vehicle for [[Whitney Houston]], who was to portray Deena. The production ran into problems when Houston wanted to sing both Deena's and Effie's songs (particularly "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"), and the film was eventually abandoned.<ref name="EarlyMovieVers">Hill, Jeremy. "[http://www.graiai.com/dreamgirls/ Film Version (2006): History]". ''Dreamgirls: Your Virtual Coffee Table Book of the Musical''. Retrieved on November 10, 2006.</ref>

When David Geffen co-founded DreamWorks SKG in 1994 and dissolved Geffen Pictures, the rights to ''Dreamgirls'' remained with Warner Bros. Warner planned to go ahead with the film, to have been directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], in the late 1990s following the success of the [[Tina Turner]] biopic ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'' (1993). Schumacher planned to have [[Lauryn Hill]] portray Deena with [[Kelly Price]] as Effie. After Warner's [[Frankie Lymon]] biopic ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' failed at the box office, the studio shut down development on ''Dreamgirls''.<ref name="EarlyMovieVers" />

DreamWorks' ''Dreamgirls'' adaptation came about after the film version of the Broadway musical ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' was a success at both the box office and the [[Academy Awards]]. Screenwriter and director [[Bill Condon]], who wrote the screenplay for ''Chicago'', met producer [[Laurence Mark]] at a Hollywood party in 2002, where the two discussed a long held "dream project" of Condon's - adapting ''Dreamgirls'' for the screen.  They were able to convince David Geffen to lease them the rights to the musical by presenting Condon's concept of telling the ''Dreamgirls'' story in a larger context, incorporating the significant changes and events that took place in the United States during the [[American Civil Rights Movement]], which occurs at the time of the story.<ref>Ulmer, James (Spet. 10, 2006). "[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/movies/moviesspecial/10ulme.html?ex=1315540800&en=b4558150c8dbe335&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss After Conquering ‘Chicago,’ It’s On to Motown]". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved on November 11, 2006.</ref>

===Stage to script changes===
While much of the stage musical's story remains intact, a number of significant changes were made. The Dreams' hometown - the setting for much of the action - was moved from [[Chicago]] to Detroit, the real-life hometown of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]]. The roles of many of the characters are related more closely to their real-life inspirations, following a suggestion by Geffen.<ref name="DavidGeffen" /> For example, Curtis Taylor's music empire expands beyond Deena Jones & the Dreams, to more closely resemble that of [[Berry Gordy]]'s Motown; and C.C. White, as the head of songwriting and production at Rainbow Records, is more clearly a [[Smokey Robinson]] analogue than he was in the original play. Also, the story's first locale is not the [[Apollo Theater]], as in the stage musical, but a local talent show in Detroit, allowing the film version of Jimmy Early to amass the level of star power he already has in the play.

Warner Bros., who still retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'', agreed to co-produce the film with DreamWorks. However, after casting was completed, the film was budgeted at $73 million and Warner backed out of the production. Geffen, taking the role of co-producer, instead had Paramount Pictures co-finance and release ''Dreamgirls''. During the course of production, Paramount's parent company, [[Viacom]], would purchase DreamWorks, aligning the two studios under one umbrella.<ref name="DavidGeffen" /> The completed film had a production budget of $75 million, making ''Dreamgirls'' the most expensive film with an all-black starring cast in cinema history. <ref name="MostExpensive">Gottfried, Marvin (2007).

===Casting and rehearsal===
[[Jamie Foxx]] was the first actor approached to play Curtis Taylor, Jr. However, the actor turned the part down because DreamWorks could not meet his salary demands. [[Denzel Washington]], [[Will Smith]], and [[Terrence Howard]] were among the actors approached after Foxx turned down the part of Curtis.<ref> Johnson, Pamela K. (Aug 2005).

As a result, ''Dreamgirls'' became Murphy's first film for Paramount since 1995; the actor at one time had an exclusive contract with the studio.

Upon learning that Knowles and Murphy had signed on, Foxx rethought his original decision and accepted the role at a lower salary than he originally requested.<ref name="EWarticle">Daly, Steve (November 10, 2006).

[[Anika Noni Rose]], a Broadway veteran and a [[Tony Award]] winner, won the part of Lorrell Robinson after an extensive auditioning process. Rose, significantly shorter than most of her co-stars at five feet and two inches, was required to wear (and dance in) four and five-inch heels for much of the picture, which she later stated caused her discomfort.<ref name="EWarticle" /> This is not Rose's first screen appearance with an ''American Idol'' contestant; she was also in the unsuccessful ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]'' with [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Justin Guarini]].

The most crucial casting decision involved the role of Effie White, the emotional center of the story. It was decided that a relative unknown would be cast, paralleling the casting of then-21-year-old [[Jennifer Holliday]] in that role for the original Broadway production. Seven hundred eighty-three singing actresses auditioned for the role of Effie White, with two of the top contenders being ''[[American Idol]]'' alumnae [[Fantasia Barrino]] and [[Jennifer Hudson]]. Hudson was eventually selected to play Effie, <ref>(Dec. 5 2005).

Beyoncé Knowles elected to lose weight to give the mature Deena Jones of the 1970s a different look than the younger version of the character. By sticking to a highly publicized diet of water and cayenne pepper (known as the [[Master Cleanse]]), Knowles rapidly lost twenty pounds, which she gained back once production ended.<ref>(May 22, 2006).

''Dreamgirls'' musical supervisors Randy Spendlove and Matt Sullivan hired R&B production team [[The Underdogs]] - Harvey Mason, Jr. and Damon Thomas - to restructure and rearrange the Krieger/Eyen ''Dreamgirls'' score so that it better reflected its proper time period, yet was also made to reflect modern R&B/pop sensiblities. <ref name="DGMusic"> Coker, Cheo Hodari (2007).

Revising the ''Dreamgirls'' score to work on film required the reduction of much of it. Much of the [[recitative]], or sung dialogue, from the original musical was replaced with spoken dialogue. While most of the major musical moments from the stage musical are retained in the film, nine of the thirty-two individual ''Dreamgirls'' songs were omitted from the film. Among these are Lorrell's solo "Ain't No Party", both instances of "Press Conference", and the "Party, Party" sequence. Also removed is the musical's choral refrain of "showbiz...it's just showbiz". C.C. and Effie's sung reunion from the second act, labeled "Effie, Sing My Song" for the film version, was shot but replaced with an alternative spoken version after test screenings.<ref name="singmysong" />

Four new songs were added for the film, "Love You I Do", "Patience", "Perfect World", and "[[Listen (song)|Listen]]". All of the new songs feature music composed by original ''Dreamgirls'' stage composer [[Henry Krieger]]. "Love You I Do", with lyrics by [[Siedah Garrett]], is performed in the film by Effie during a rehearsal at the Rainbow Records studio. [[Willie Reale]] wrote the lyrics for "Patience", a song performed in the film by Jimmy, Lorrell, C.C., and a gospel choir as the characters attempt to record a "message song" for Jimmy. "Perfect World", also featuring lyrics by Garrett, is performed during the Rainbow 10th anniversary special sequence by [[Jackson 5]] doppelgangers The Campbell Connection. "[[Listen (song)|Listen]]", with additional music by [[Scott Cutler]] & [[Beyoncé Knowles]], and lyrics by [[Anne Preven]], is presented as a defining moment for Deena's character late in the film.

The ''[[Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture]]'' [[soundtrack album]] was released on [[December 5]] by Music World Entertainment/[[Columbia Records]], in both a single-disc version containing highlights and a double-disc "Deluxe Version" containing all of the film's songs. The single-disc version of the soundtrack peaked at number-one on the [[Billboard 200]] during a slow sales week in early January 2007.<ref>Hasty, Katie (Jan. 10, 2007).
