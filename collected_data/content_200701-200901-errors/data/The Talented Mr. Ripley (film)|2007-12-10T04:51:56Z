'''''The Talented Mr. Ripley''''' is a 1999 [[feature film]] directed by [[Anthony Minghella]]. It is an adaptation of the [[The Talented Mr. Ripley|1955 novel]] by [[Patricia Highsmith]], which was also filmed in 1960 as ''[[Plein Soleil]]''.

''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' starred [[Matt Damon]] as [[Tom Ripley]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Marge Sherwood, [[Jude Law]] as Dickie Greenleaf, [[Cate Blanchett]] as Meredith Logue (a character created for the film), [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Freddie Miles, [[Jack Davenport]] as Peter Smith-Kingsley (a character expanded for the film) and [[James Rebhorn]] as Herbert Greenleaf.

It was filmed mainly in [[Italy]] with famous landmarks in the cities of [[Rome]] and [[Venice]] being used as a backdrop for the narrative.  An [[opera]] scene features the duel between Lensky and Onegin from ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''.

== Plot ==
{{main|The Talented Mr. Ripley}}

Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in [[New York City]], with no prospects but with a talent to survive by doing whatever is required. When approached by the wealthy Herbert Greenleaf to travel to Italy to persuade Greenleaf's errant son, Dickie, to return to the United States and assume his responsibilities, Ripley sees this as an opportunity. Shortly after his arrival in Italy, he meets the younger Greenleaf and his girlfriend, Marge Sherwood, and quickly insinuates himself into their lives. Over time Marge becomes suspicious of him and Dickie begins to tire of his new friend, who views him as an almost-lover, resenting Ripley's constant presence and growing dependence.  Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the wealthy lifestyle Greenleaf has afforded him and by his growing obsession with his new friend. 

As a gesture to Ripley, Greenleaf agrees to travel with him on a short holiday to [[Sanremo]], [[Italy]]. The two hire a small boat and, after a minor confrontation, Ripley murders Dickie and sinks the boat containing the body.

Ripley assumes Greenleaf's identity, carefully providing communications to Marge to assure her that Dickie has merely deserted her, while living off Greenleaf's allowance. Greenleaf's old friend Freddie Miles visits Ripley at what he supposes to be Greenleaf's apartment in Rome. He is immediately suspicious of Ripley and inadvertently discovers his scam. Ripley murders Miles and dumps the body. 

Over the next few weeks, Ripley's existence becomes a cat and mouse game with the Italian police and Greenleaf's friends. Ripley is particularly careful around Meredith Logue, a heiress whom he met while traveling to Italy, who believes Ripley to be Dickie Greenleaf. He eventually restores his own identity, forges a [[suicide]] note in Greenleaf's name and moves to Venice. In succession, Marge, Greenleaf's father and an American private detective confront Ripley. He contemplates murdering Marge but is interrupted when Marge's friend Peter Smith-Kingsley enters the apartment with a key that Ripley gave him.  

Toward the end of the film, the private detective reveals that Greenleaf's father has decided to give Ripley a portion of Dickie's income with the understanding that certain details about his son's past will not be revealed to the Italian police. A relieved Ripley goes on a cruise with Smith-Kingsley, his new lover, only to discover that Meredith Logue, who has the potential to reveal his stolen identity, is also on the boat. The movie concludes with a tortured Ripley killing Smith-Kingsley.  

=== Differences from the book ===
The film broadly follows Highsmith's [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], but Minghella's screenplay made some changes and introduced characters to complicate Ripley's dilemma.   

In the novel, Marge is insecure and frumpy (described as having a "gourdlike figure") and she may be one in a line of Greenleaf's meaningless flings. As portrayed by Paltrow, she is a more compatible counterpoint to Greenleaf, and both film versions of the novel suggest that Greenleaf's feelings for her are genuine. 

The film differs somewhat from the novel and the earlier film in its portrayal of Ripley. While the Ripley character in the novel has some sympathetic qualities, he is primarily a [[sociopath]] with no qualms about committing cold-blooded murder whenever it suits him; as portrayed in Minghella's film, however, he is an almost [[tragic]] figure motivated by his own self-hatred and not completely immune to [[guilt]]. This characterization received a certain amount of criticism. <ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/05/15/the_talented_mr_ripley_2000_review.shtml</ref>
Although it is clear from the novel that Ripley is not from the same privileged background as Dickie, the 'social gulf' between the two is exaggerated in the film so that Tom is more awkward and poorer than in the novel. At the beginning of Highsmith's novel, Ripley is already posing, fraudulently, as a tax official from a government department writing to tax payers to demand further payment on top of that they had already paid. There are also hints at a dark past. In the film, he works as a lavatory attendant and other working-class jobs so his change in character to the sociopath he becomes is far more marked.   

The Greenleaf character in the film also differs somewhat from the novel. While Highsmith's characterization of him as a charismatic, spoiled playboy remains fundamentally intact, the character in Minghella's film has a darker side that is absent from the novel. In the film, he has a fierce temper that can give way to violence &mdash; his father sent him to Italy to escape publicity after he nearly killed a man in a barfight &mdash; and he heartlessly abandons a local woman he has impregnated, who eventually commits suicide.   

The 1999 film also explores Ripley's fascination with Greenleaf as more overtly sexual. While this is alluded to in the novel, the film expands upon Ripley's feelings of jealousy and inadequacy and creates greater tension between the characters. 

The motivation for the murder of Greenleaf is treated quite differently, although the setting is identical. In the 1999 film, Ripley kills Greenleaf in a moment of rage after being mocked and rejected. In the novel and in ''Plein Soleil'', the murder is premeditated, with Ripley planning each detail in advance and then carrying it out.  

Minghella created one character and modified another to provide Ripley with additional complications. Meredith Logue is an American heiress who is bored by her family's [[wealth]] but quite content to spend the money. She meets Ripley shortly after his arrival in Italy, and he introduces himself to her as Greenleaf. With their shared contempt for their families, she feels she has found a kindred spirit in Ripley (as Greenleaf), and the two have a romance of sorts. Her presence in Rome causes Ripley problems when he is with Marge, as Meredith, who knows him only as Greenleaf, keeps appearing at inopportune moments.

Peter Smith-Kingsley is a minor character in the novel, appearing only in a few scenes and having no real influence on the plot. In the film, however, he becomes Ripley's confidante and, eventually, his lover. The final scene, in which a sobbing Ripley strangles him to avoid his scheme being revealed, does not appear in the novel.

==Filming locations==
The second filming of Highsmith's novel conjures up Italy of the 1950s from a patchwork of  locations.

The film opens in [[New York]], where Ripley works at the [[Lyceum Theatre]], 149 West 45th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues (used in the 1947 [[George Cukor]] backstage melodrama ''[[A Double Life]]''.)

The interior of Ripley's dismal basement apartment was actually the ground floor of a tenement on [[Second Avenue]] at 26th Street in the Gramercy district, but the exterior, with the steep flight of iron steps, is the tiny passageway of Franklin Place, between White Street and [[Franklin Street]] in [[Tribeca]].

Ripley arrives in Italy at the art deco terminal of [[Palermo]], on the northwest coast of [[Sicily]].

To represent the fictitious resort of [[Mongibello]], where Greenleaf idles away his time with Marge, the movie uses the island of [[Ischia]] in the [[Bay of Naples]].

The cobbled square where Ripley gets off the bus is [[Ischia]] Ponte, below the towering 12th century Castello Aragonese which dominates the island's northeast coast. The best way to reach [[Ischia]] Ponte is by catching a bus, about a mile east of the ferry landing at [[Ischia]] Porto.

The private beach where Ripley first discovers Greenleaf and Marge is Bagno Antonio, between Ischia Ponte and Ischia Porte. 

The main shopping street and town square of Mongibello, however, can be found on [[Procida]], a neighboring island, twenty minutes away by ferry.

The [[Vesuvio]] nightclub, supposedly in [[Naples]], where Greenleaf takes Ripley for a night on the town, is the Caffe Latino, Via Monte Testaccio 96 in Rome, whereas the [[Rome]] opera house, where Ripley poses as Greenleaf, is the [[Teatro San Carlo]], Via San Carlo in [[Naples]].

The San Remo jazz festival, where Ripley begins to realize that the idyll is coming to an end, is the seafront at [[Anzio]], on the coast about 30 miles south of Rome (the real San Remo is up at the French border).

Ripley's Roman hotel, the Grand Hotel Via Vittorio Emanuele Orlando 3, off Piazza della Repubblica, is in the [[Eternal City]], as is the cafe where Freddie Miles turns up, on [[Piazza Navona]] opposite [[Bernini]]'s Fountain of the Four Rivers.

When Ripley returns to Rome after Dickie's murder, he stays in an apartment on the fictitious 'Piazza Gioia', which is actually near the old [[Jew]]ish [[Ghetto]], on Piazza Mattei. The interior of the apartment‚ which also functioned as the Grand Hotel suite‚ is the 14th century Palazzo Taverna, Via di Monte Giordano 36.

After he moves on to Venice, Ripley stays in an apartment which is an amalgam of the abandoned Ca Sagredo and the Palazzo Mosto.

Marge, having arrived at the Santa Lucia Railway Station, at the northern end of [[Canal Grande]], finally voices her suspicions about Greenleaf's disappearance at Venetian landmark [[Caffè Florian]], [[Piazza San Marco]] 56-59.

The hotel where Ripley meets Greenleaf's father is the Europa e Regina, Calle Larga 22 Marzo, [[San Marco (sestiere of Venice)|San Marco]] 2159 on the Canal Grande, facing the Chiesa della Salute.

The Venetian church where Smith-Kingsley rehearses the [[Stabat Mater]] is in fact the 14th century [[Chiesa della Martorana]], Piazza Bellini in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]].
