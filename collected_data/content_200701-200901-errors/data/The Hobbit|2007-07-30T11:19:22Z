'''''The Hobbit''''' is an epic fantasy story written by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in the tradition of the [[fairy tale]]. It was first published on [[September 21]], [[1937]]. While it also stands in its own right, it is often seen as a prelude to Tolkien's monumental [[fantasy]] [[novel]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (published in 1954 through 1955).

== Writing the Book == 
In a [[1955]] letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects in the late 1920s, when he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], he began ''The Hobbit'' when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found one blank piece of paper. Suddenly inspired he wrote the words "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up Thror's map, outlining the geography of the tale. It was eventually published when a family friend named Elaine Griffiths was shown a typescript of the story in the early 1930s. When she later went to work for George Allen & Unwin, she revealed the existence of the story to a staffmember named Susan Dagnall, who in turn asked Tolkien if she could look at the (still incomplete) manuscript. He complied and Ms. Dagnall, impressed by it, urged him to complete the book. Once this was done in late 1936, she then showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by [[Allen & Unwin]].

Tolkien introduced or mentioned characters and places that figured prominently in his [[legendarium]], specifically [[Elrond]] and [[Gondolin]], along with elements from Germanic legend. But the decision that the events of ''The Hobbit'' could belong to the same universe as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was made only after publication, when the publisher asked for a sequel and Tolkien began work on what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

The novel draws on Tolkien's knowledge of historical languages and early European texts — many names and words derived from [[Norse mythology]], it makes use of [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[rune]]s, and is filled with information on calendars and moon phases, detailed geographical descriptions that fit well with the accompanying maps — attention to detail that would also be seen in Tolkien's later work.

==Plot summary==
A hobbit named [[Bilbo Baggins]] is smoking outside his comfortable hole one morning when [[Gandalf]] the Wizard passes by, seeking an adventurer. The mere thought of an adventure flusters Bilbo into inviting Gandalf to tea the next day, and escaping back into his hole. An amused Gandalf scratches a mark on Bilbo's door, indicating 'Burglar seeks employment'. The next day, [[Thorin Oakenshield]] and twelve other dwarves show up at the hole, along with Gandalf, and begin discussing their planned treasure hunt: A map is produced which shows the [[Lonely Mountain]] (Erebor); once ruled by Thorin's grandfather, it was seized by the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]]. The map shows a [[secret passage|secret door]] into the mountain, which the dwarves hope to use to reclaim their home and is why the expedition needs a burglar. At first Bilbo wants nothing to do with the scheme, but then in a moment of anger commits to joining.

The next morning Bilbo goes off with the dwarves and the wizard. They are nearly eaten by three [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]], but Gandalf tricks the trolls into staying up all night arguing, whereupon they are turned into stone by the light of dawn. In the trolls' cave they find stolen treasure, including Elvish weapons. Bilbo acquires the dagger [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], which glows blue in the presence of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblins]].

The party travels to [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]] [[Rivendell]] where they receive useful advice from Rivendell's master [[Elrond]]. Proceeding eastwards into the [[Misty Mountains]], they are ambushed by Goblins and carried down underground. Gandalf manages to free them, but Bilbo becomes separated from the others. Wandering alone in the dark, he finds a [[One Ring|ring]] and puts it in his pocket.

Continuing on, he arrives at an underground lake. The creature [[Gollum]] paddles up, and the two enact a game of [[riddle]]s: if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out, but if he loses, Gollum will eat Bilbo. After several turns, Bilbo asks himself aloud "What have I got in my pocket?", which Gollum both accepts as the next riddle and fails to correctly answer. Bilbo demands his reward, but Gollum refuses and paddles off to collect his most precious possession, a magic ring which turns its wearer invisible. His search unsuccessful, he belatedly realizes the answer to Bilbo's riddle, and goes storming back. Bilbo in turn attempts to flee, and when Gollum gives chase, the ring slips onto the hobbit's finger. Quickly deducing the object's power, he follows Gollum to the only exit, where he jumps over the wretched creature and escapes. Bypassing the Goblins, he returns to the surface and rejoins the dwarves and Gandalf.

Descending from the mountains, they are carried away from a deadly encounter with [[Warg]]s (wild wolf creatures) and Goblins by [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Giant Eagles]]. They recuperate for several days with [[Beorn]], a solitary giant who can transform into a bear, then travel to the edge of the black forest [[Mirkwood]]. While Gandalf departs on a private errand, the others enter the forest, slogging on for days and running out of supplies. Warned not to leave the path, the group nevertheless glimpses [[Wood-elves]] feasting, and goes to beg food. They are promptly captured by giant spiders, but Bilbo fights off the spiders using the ring and Sting. The Elves then capture the dwarves, but an invisible Bilbo manages to sneak into the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]]'s palace, and helps the imprisoned dwarves escape in provision-barrels floated down the river under the palace.

After spending more recovery-time at [[Laketown (Middle-earth)|Laketown]], the treasure-seekers proceed on to the Lonely Mountain. While they eventually locate the secret entrance, they are unable to open it until, as foretold by the map, a [[thrush (bird)|thrush]] knocks at the snails on a nearby stone and the last rays of the Sun of [[Durin's Day]] magically reveal the door's lockhole. Bilbo twice goes down to meet Smaug, who sleeps deep in the mountain on an enormous pile of treasure. The hobbit makes off with a large handled cup and learns that the dragon has a bare patch on his left chest. The enraged dragon correctly deduces that the Company received help from the people of Laketown and sets out to destroy the community. However, the thrush was one of a race with whom the men of the lake could communicate, and it overhears Bilbo's report about Smaug's weak point. As the dragon ravages Laketown, the thrush conveys this information to one [[Bard the Bowman]], who dispatches the dragon with a dwarf-made arrow. When Smaug does not return, the dwarves take possession of the Mountain. Bilbo finds the prized [[Arkenstone]] and tucks it away in his possessions.

The citizens of Laketown and the Wood-elves arrive at the Mountain to demand compensation for the help they had rendered, as well as reparations for the dragon attack. Thorin refuses all negotiations and summons his kin from the north. Bilbo attempts to use the Arkenstone as ransom to head off a war, but the various parties are intransigent, Thorin expels Bilbo from the Mountain, and a fight seems inevitable.

But suddenly Gandalf is on the battlefield, warning the various leaders that a new more dire threat approaches: a ravenging army of Goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, humans and elves immediately put aside their differences, and a bitter battle ensues, the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Losses are heavy on all sides, but with the timely arrival of the Giant Eagles and Beorn, the anti-Goblin forces prevail. Thorin is among the casualties, but he lives long enough to part from Bilbo as friends. The treasure is apportioned fairly, but, having no need or desire for it, Bilbo refuses most of his share of the riches. He nevertheless returns home with enough to make himself a wealthy hobbit and live happily thereafter.

== Joining ''The Hobbit'' to ''The Lord of the Rings'' ==
In the first edition, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle game. During the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'' Tolkien saw the need to revise this passage, in order to reflect his new concept of the [[One Ring]] and its powerful hold on Gollum. Tolkien tried many different passages in the chapter that would become chapter 2 of ''the Lord of the Rings'', "The Shadow of the Past". Eventually Tolkien decided a rewrite of ''The Hobbit'' was in order, and he sent a sample chapter of this rewrite ("Riddles in the Dark") to his publishers. Initially he heard nothing further, but when he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition he learned to his surprise the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding.

In the introduction of ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as inside "The Shadow of the Past", the differences of the first edition are explained as a "lie" that Bilbo made up because of the One Ring's influence on him, and which he originally wrote down in his book. Inside ''The Lord of the Rings'', Bilbo finally confesses the true story at the Council of [[Elrond]], although Gandalf had deduced the truth earlier. As Tolkien presented himself as the translator of the supposedly historic ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'', where Bilbo and Frodo's stories were recorded, he further explained the two differing stories in ''The Hobbit'' by stating he had originally used Bilbo's original story, but later retranslated the work with the "true story" recorded by Frodo.

This first edition also uses the word "[[gnome]]", which Tolkien in his earlier writing had used to refer to the second kindred of the [[High Elves]] – the [[Noldor]] (or "Deep Elves"). Tolkien thought that "gnome", being derived from the Greek ''gnosis'' (knowledge), was a good name for the Noldor he created to be the wisest of the other Elves. But with its English connotations of a small, secretive, and unattractive creature (see [[garden gnome]]) Tolkien removed it from later editions.

He made other minor changes in order to conform the narrative to events in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in the ideas he was continually developing for the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''.

=== Differences and inconsistencies ===
{{OR}}
When finally revised, ''The Hobbit'' still has many differences from ''The Lord of the Rings''. Examples include the following:

* Matches are only featured in ''The Hobbit''.
* The trolls have English first names (Tom, Bert and Bill), and Bill has the English last name Huggins.
* The elves in Rivendell appear very happy, active and playful, contrasting highly with their noble, sombre portrayal in the rest of the Legendarium.
* There is lighthearted use of "magic"; Gandalf is said to have given the [[Old Took]] a pair of diamond studs that "fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered", and when Bilbo tries to steal a purse from the trolls, the purse shouts. Magic is not used so in ''The Lord of the Rings'', and is more often an enhancement or corruption of natural phenomena.
* The narrative style features many asides where the narrator addresses the reader directly.
* The hobbits' "[[pipe-weed]]" which is also featured in ''The Lord of the Rings'' is explicitly referred to as "tobacco".
* Orcs are called Goblins in ''The Hobbit'', but more often referred to as Orcs in ''The Lord of the Rings'' (particularly when the speaker is not a Hobbit).

Many of these inconsistencies occur because Tolkien originally wrote the book as a children's story separate from (but connected to) his mythological work,<ref name="carpenter-tolkien">{{cite book | last = Carpenter | first = Humphrey | authorlink = Humphrey Carpenter | title = J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography | publisher = [[George Allen & Unwin]] | location = London | year = 1977 | oclc = 3046822}}</ref> and his concept of Middle-earth was to change and evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>Christopher Tolkien, ''The History of Middle-earth''</ref>

As told in "[[The Quest of Erebor]]" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Tolkien later had Gandalf say that Bilbo's account would have been very different, if ''he'' had written it instead.<ref name="unfinished-tales">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J.

== Publications of early drafts ==

In May and June 2007, HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin are publishing in two parts ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]''.  Much like ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', ''The History of The Hobbit'' will examine previously unpublished original drafts of ''The Hobbit'' with extensive commentary by John Rateliff.

== Editions ==
[[Image:Hobbit cover.JPG|right|200px|thumb|200px|Dustcover of the first edition of ''The Hobbit''. This cover was designed by Tolkien himself, as was the binding illustrated at the top of this article.]]
George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' in September 1937. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien himself. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by December due to enthusiastic reviews. Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York prepared an American edition to be released early in 1938 in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937. Despite the book's popularity, wartime conditions forced the London publisher to print small runs of the remaining two printings of the first edition.

As remarked above, Tolkien substantially revised ''The Hobbit'''s text describing Bilbo's dealings with Gollum in order to blend the story better into what ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had become. This revision became the second edition, published in 1951 in both UK and American editions. Slight corrections to the text have appeared in the third (1966) and fourth editions (1978).

New [[English-language editions of The Hobbit|English-language editions of ''The Hobbit'']] spring up often, despite the book's age, with at least fifty editions having been published to date. Each comes from a different publisher or bears distinctive cover art, internal art, or substantial changes in format. The text of each generally adheres to the Allen & Unwin edition extant at the time it is published.

The remarkable and enduring popularity of ''The Hobbit'' expresses itself in the collectors' market. The first printing of the first English language edition rarely sells for under $10,000 US dollars in any whole condition, and clean copies in original dust jackets signed by the author are routinely advertised for over $100,000. Online auction site [[eBay]] tends to define the market value for those who [[Early American editions of The Hobbit|collect ''The Hobbit'']].

* [[Led Zeppelin]]'s song "[[Misty Mountain Hop]]" contains references to ''The Hobbit'', whilst other songs are thought to be influenced by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
* "[[The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins]]", performed by [[Leonard Nimoy]] as part of his 1968 ''Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy'' album, is the most pertinent because it recounts the book's storyline in its two minutes.

* A [[Trance music|trance]] track was released in 1995 by [[Dynamix Maniax]], featuring the title "Calling Middle-earth", containing a muffled sample from the 1977 [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated version of ''The Hobbit'']].
* The Canadian rock trio [[Rush (band)|Rush]] references the elven refuge of [[Rivendell]] on their 1975 album ''[[Fly by Night (album)|Fly by Night]]'' in a song of the same name.
* In the episode of ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'' "[[Journey to the Center of Nowhere]]", Courage's master Muriel is held captive by three large [[eggplant]] monsters that roughly resemble trolls. The eggplants argue amongst themselves over how to cook Muriel, whether they should fry her, grill her, bake her, or sit on her until she becomes jelly, a scene taken directly from ''The Hobbit''.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}
