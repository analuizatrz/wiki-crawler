The '''Star Alliance''', launched on [[May 14]] [[1997]], is the oldest, largest and most awarded [[airline alliance]] in the world, with the following points of cooperation among its partner [[airline]]s:

*[[Frequent flyer program]] integration allows airline miles to be earned and redeemed on all members of the Alliance at the same level (with the exception of certain deeply discounted classes) and lounge access by Gold card holders when flying in economy class
*Premium customers of the alliance have access to all members' airport lounges.
*Flight schedules are coordinated to permit almost seamless travel which may include several different carriers within the alliance, on a single ticket
*Special fares for round-the-world and similar travel on alliance members offer discounts over booking individual itineraries
*Customer service processes are harmonized in an effort to promote a consistent experience
*Cooperation in development of a common information technology platform

{{TOCleft}}This tight cooperation led to suspicions of anti-competitive behaviour, and the alliance was investigated by the [[European Union]] as a virtual merger of its members. Indeed, some speculated that if government regulations were relaxed, the members would merge into a single corporation, although no evidence has yet materialized. Previous to Star Alliance, [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[KLM]] were operating together as the forerunners of the modern airline alliance system since 1993—although there had been even earlier pairings and groupings of airlines for decades on a less formal level.  The creation of the Star Alliance was a milestone in airline history due to its size and sparked the formation of rivals, notably [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]].
 
Star Alliance members now fly over 16 000 daily flights to 855 airports in 155 countries utilizing a fleet of 2 778 aircraft. Its members carried a total of 405.7 million passengers with a turnover of 95.3 billion US dollars in 2006. The alliance's market share is 28% of the global market (based on RPK or [[revenue passenger kilometers]]). All Star Alliance carriers combined employ over 350 000 pilots, flight attendants, and other staff.

The alliance developed the "regional" concept in 2004, which helps the Star Alliance penetrate individual markets with the regional participation of smaller carriers. Regional Star Alliance members have to be sponsored by an existing full Star Alliance member.

Star Alliance was voted best airline alliance in the [[Skytrax]] 2007 World Airline Awards.<ref>{{cite web|date=2007|publisher=Skytrax|url=http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards_2007/Allnc.htm|title=2007 World Airlines Awards - Best Alliance|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

In some cases (such as Air New Zealand Link airlines and bmi regional) the branding of the 'parent' full member may be so strong as to mean passengers are unaware of the affiliate's independent existence.[[Image:Star Alliance.png|thumb|right|350px|Star Alliance Logos with future members [[Air China]], [[Shanghai Airlines]] and [[Turkish Airlines]]]]

However, Air India postponed talks with Star Alliance due to its ongoing merger with [[Indian Airlines]]. Presently (as of August 2007) Air India is in talks for membership again, and executives from both organizations have said that they will be making an official announcement in December 2007.<ref>[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Company/CompaniesA-Z/A_Companies/Air_India_all_set_to_join_Star_Alliance/articleshow/2264102.cms The Economic Times - Air India all set to join Star Alliance]</ref>

<!-- 27 July 2007 has now passed so, presumably, this section is no longer appropriate:
* {{flagicon|Australia}} [[Virgin Blue]] - Since May 2007, speculation has arisen that Star Alliance will resume negotiations for Australia's second-biggest airline, [[Virgin Blue]], to join the alliance. This would fill the gap left since the collapse of [[Ansett Australia]] in 2001, and allow Virgin to deliver a better focus on corporate customers. [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21750204-23349,00.html] This speculation has been fuelled by a somewhat cryptic email sent by Virgin Blue to their Velocity members, hinting of a major change to their frequent flyer program, expected to be announced on [[July 27]], 2007, along with the name of Virgin Blue's new international airline.[http://www.frequentflyer.com.au/community/virgin-blue-velocity/are-you-in-know-10345.html]
