'''American Eagle Outfitters''' is an [[:Category:Clothing companies of the United States|American clothing and accessories]] retailer based in the [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The founder of American Eagle Outfitters is  Edward Beinstein, who was nicknamed the "American Eagle" because of his wide armspan. The brand dates back to [[1904]], but took its current form in [[1977]] when it was reorganized in Pittsburgh's north suburbs.  At one time, it sold brands such as [[OshKosh B'Gosh|OshKosh]] in the early [[1980s]], similar to [[Gap (clothing)|Gap]] selling [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]].

==Other brands==
In addition to its namesake brand, American Eagle, the company has developed and announced plans for several new brand and concept initiatives poised to drive new growth as the American Eagle brand nears saturation in current markets. One already launched brand being aerie. 

The company's second stand-alone lifestyle concept, [[Martin + Osa]], launched in the fall of 2006, targets men and women 25 to 40 years of age. 

The company has also indicated that a third lifestyle concept is in development that analysts speculate could be aimed at [[Baby Boomers]] (Born during 1945–65 period), and may offer homewares.

In the year [[2001]], the company acquired a [[Canada]]-based retail concept called [[Bluenotes]], which has approximately 100 stores averaging 3,300 square feet. The concept targeted a slightly younger demographic, ages 12-22, and was positioned as a denim-driven urban/suburban lifestyle brand. Due largely to poor performance, the Bluenotes business was sold to YM Inc. in [[2004]].

The line Aerie was announced in [[February 2006]] as an intimate apparel sub-brand offering bras, panties, and dormwear targeting American Eagle's core 15- to 25-year-old demographic segment.

==AE All-Access Pass==
In [[September 2005]], American Eagle Outfitters announced the All-Access Pass program. Customers are given a physical "All-Access Pass", which is about the size of a credit card. If you register online for the AE All-Access Pass, you will be prompted to print off a temporary pass, while the actual card will be mailed to you in 2-3 weeks. Customers receiving the pass are also given two cards for their key rings and multiple stickers for MP3 players as well as cell phones. Customers earn points when they present the card to the cashier at the store or enter the card number while checking out at AE.com. Each type of product earns a different amount of points – for example, jeans are worth 20 points. If you collect 50 points, you'll receive 10% off your next purchase, 100 points earns you 20% off next purchase, and so on and so forth. Customers can earn coupons up to 40% off and 15% off around birthdays. The rewards are mailed out 4 times a year: in January, April, July, and October. 

==Competition==
American Eagle Outfitters is often compared to the clothing companies [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] and [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]], due to their similar styles, marketing techniques, and targeted consumer demographic, as well as the department store private label brands [[Arizona Jean Company]] ([[JC Penney]]) and American Rag ([[Macy's]]).

American Eagle Outfitters brands much of their clothing with an embroidered landing [[eagle]], similar to [[Abercrombie & Fitch|Abercrombie and Fitch's]] standing [[moose]], [[Hollister Co.]]'s [[seagull]], and [[Aéropostale (clothing)|Aeropostale]]'s butterfly for females and bulldog for males. Additionally, American Eagle emphasizes on their date of establishment, [[1977]], in their marketing and design, branding the majority of their products with the date.

In [[2007]], textile and apparel workers union [[UNITE HERE]] launched the "American Vulture" back-to-school boycott of American Eagle [http://www.americanvulture.org] in protest of alleged workers' rights violations at the company's Canadian distribution contractor National Logistics Services (NLS). On the 2007 second quarter conference call[http://seekingalpha.com/article/45199-american-eagle-outfitters-f2q07-qtr-end-8-4-07-earnings-call-transcript], CEO James O'Donnell clarified the American Eagle's relationship with NLS and its effect on business. He explained, <blockquote>
We owned NLS with the acquisition of Braemar back in 2000 and we subsequently sold off NLS in 2006, and we are currently a customer of NLS... We have really no involvement at all with Unite Here and NLS. Our only involvement with NLS is basically as a customer and there have been some allegations made I think to some of, to the public about it affecting our business. I can tell you right now it has not affected our business. The boycotts have not affected any business. Any activity has not affected any of our business.

Launched in September, the new intimates sub-brand, featuring a full line of undies, bras and dorm-wear, is designed to be sweetly-sexy. The brand has been met with strong customer acceptance. The company's expansion plans are based on the positive results of three aerie stand-alone test stores. If new stores continue to perform as well as the test stores, aerie could be a 350+ store chain by [[2012]]. In the fourth quarter, American Eagle opened eight new AE stores and remodeled 20 locations

Additionally, approximately 45 AE store remodels are planned, which combined with new store openings will generate total [[2007]] square footage growth of approximately 10%.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}
