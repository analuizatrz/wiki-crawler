'''VKhUTEMAS''' ({{lang-ru|ВХУТЕМАС, Высшие художественно-технические мастерские}} is [[acronym]] for Higher Art and Technical Studios) was the Russian state art and technical school founded in [[1920]] in [[Moscow]], in 1926 its name was modified: "Institute" instead of "Studios" (ВХУТЕИН, Высший художественно-технический институт), or Vkutein. It was dissolved in [[1930]].

VKhUTEMAS was closely parallel to the [[Germany|German]] [[Bauhaus]] in its intent, organization and scope.  Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture.  Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period, and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes. [[Hannes Meyer]], the second Bauhaus director, tried to organise an exchange between the two schools.

Professors at the school included some of the significant names of Soviet philosophy, art and architecture of the period, most of them associated with [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]: [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Vladimir Andreevic]], [[Aleksandr Larionov]], [[Vladimir Favorsky]], [[Konstantin Melnikov]], [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Naum Gabo]], [[El Lissitzky]], [[Nikolai Ladovsky]],  [[Moisei Ginzburg]], [[Meer Akselrod]] and [[Gustav Klutsis]].
