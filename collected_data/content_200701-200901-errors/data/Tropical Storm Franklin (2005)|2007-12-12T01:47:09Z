'''Tropical Storm Franklin''' was a [[tropical storm]] over the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] during July of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It was the sixth named storm of the season and twice approached hurricane strength.

The storm formed over the [[Bahamas]] on [[July 21]] then moved north erratically, approaching [[Bermuda]] on [[July 26]]. Franklin eventually became [[extratropical]] near [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] on [[July 30]], before being absorbed by a larger system. The [[National Hurricane Center]] struggled to predict Tropical Storm Franklin mainly due to difficulties in predicting the effects of wind shear. There were only minor effects on land from Tropical Storm Franklin and no damages were caused.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Franklin 2005 track.png}}
A tropical wave emerged from the [[Africa]]n coast late on [[July 10]]. The wave entered the [[Bahamas]] on [[July 21]] and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70 miles (110 km) east of [[Eleuthera]].<ref name="FranklinTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Franklin|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 27|accessyear=2006|format=PDF|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL062005_Franklin.pdf}}</ref> Initially the storm was predicted to execute a clockwise loop and drift to the west in response to a high pressure system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm to drift westward into central [[Florida]]. <ref name="NHC-disc1>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Depression Six, 5:00 p.m. EDT, July 21 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 27|accessyear=2006|url =http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al062005.discus.001.shtml}}</ref> Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.

Tropical Storm Franklin suffered high levels of wind shear associated with the development of [[Tropical Storm Gert (2005)|Tropical Storm Gert]], which led the forecasters at the [[National Hurricane Center]] to say that Franklin could be torn apart in the next few days.<ref name="NHC-disc7>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Franklin, 11:00 p.m. EDT, July 22 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 27|accessyear=2006|url =http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al062005.discus.007.shtml}}</ref> However the shear abated as Franklin moved to the northeast allowing the storm to strengthen. The forecasters now said that Franklin could "attain and maintain hurricane strength" and make a close approach to [[Bermuda]].<ref name="NHC-disc8>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Franklin, 5:00 a.m. EDT, July 23 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 27|accessyear=2006|url =http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al062005.discus.008.shtml}}</ref>
Shortly after on [[July 23]], Tropical Storm Franklin reached its peak strength with 70 mph (110 km/h) winds.<ref name="FranklinTCR"/>

Franklin moved erratically to the east weakening as shear increased again. The NHC predicted that would dissipate, but the weakening trend stopped on [[July 25]] with Franklin a minimal tropical storm.<ref name="NHC-disc13>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Franklin, 11:00 a.m. EDT, July 24 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 27|accessyear=2006|url =http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al062005.discus.013.shtml}}</ref> The storm passed to 200 miles (325 km) to the west of Bermuda on [[July 26]] and moved slowly northwards into the warmer waters of the [[Gulf Stream]]. The shear also reduced once again allowing Franklin to re-strengthen somewhat, with winds reaching 60 mph (95 km/h) on [[July 28]]. Franklin began to accelerate to the northeast becoming [[extratropical]] on [[July 30]] to the south of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm passed just south of the [[Avalon Peninsula]] later that day and was absorbed by a larger system on [[July 31]].<ref name="FranklinTCR"/>

==Impact==
As Tropical Storm Franklin was forming, a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] was issued for the northwest [[Bahamas]], but it was cancelled as Franklin moved north and away from the islands. A tropical storm watch was issued for [[Bermuda]] on [[July 25]] but was cancelled a day later when Franklin turned away.<ref name="FranklinTCR"/>

Tropical Storm Franklin developed very close to land in the [[Bahamas]] and passed near [[Bermuda]], but there were no reports of tropical storm force winds overland, with the strongest gust recorded on Bermuda being 37 mph (60 km/h). After Franklin became extratropical, it brushed southeastern Newfoundland, bringing about 1 inch (25 mm) of rain to the area.<ref name="CHC-bulletin">{{cite web|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|title=Bulletin on Post-Tropical Storm Franklin, 12:30 p.m. NDT, July 30 2005|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=April 27|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20050730143826.Franklin.txt.en}}</ref> There were no damages or fatalities as a result of Tropical Storm Franklin.<ref name="FranklinTCR"/>

==Naming and records==
When Franklin formed on [[July 21]], it was the earliest ever in a season that the sixth tropical storm formed, beating the previous record held by storm 6 of the [[1936 Atlantic hurricane season|1936 season]] by 14 days. This was the first use of Franklin to name a tropical storm following the retirement of [[Hurricane Floyd]] of the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season|1999 season]]. Due to the lack of any major impact from Tropical Storm Franklin, the name was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and will be on the list of names for the 2011 Season.
