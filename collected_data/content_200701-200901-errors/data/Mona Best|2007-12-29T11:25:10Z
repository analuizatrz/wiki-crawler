'''Mona "Mo" Best''', ([[3 January]] [[1924]]-[[9 September]] [[1988]]) was born in [[India]], and is best known as the mother of [[Pete Best]] (b.1941) who was an early member of [[The Beatles]]. Mona also had two other sons, Rory (b.1944) and Roag Best (b.1962). It was later confirmed that Roag's father is The Beatles' associate [[Neil Aspinall]], although he was not registered as the father on Roag's birth certificate. 

After moving to [[Liverpool]] from India, the Best family claim that Mona pawned all of her jewellery in 1954, and used the money to place a 33-1 [[Gambling|bet]] on a horse named "Never Say Die", and used her winnings to buy a house in 1957. Mona later opened [[The Casbah Coffee Club]] in the cellar of the house as a venue for [[Rock and roll|Rock 'n' Roll]] music. It was planned as a members-only club for her sons and their friends. The club was often referred to as The Casbah Club, or The Casbah.

[[The Quarrymen]]—[[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and Ken Brown—frequently played at The Casbah instead of the [[The Cavern Club]], which had a jazz-only policy at that time. The Casbah Club cellar—with its original decoration—still exists. In 2006, the property was accorded a [[Grade II]] Heritage listing. Mona died in 1988, after a heart attack following a long illness.

Being a part of Best's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which included meeting well-known sports personalities of the time and receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre.<ref name="BestRoagPetep18"> Roag and Pete Best "The Beatles: The True Beginnings" 2003 p18</ref> The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family's large home in [[West Derby]], which was called "Ellerslie Manor", but Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife.<ref name="BestRoagPetep21"> Roag and Pete Best "The Beatles: The True Beginnings" 2003 p21</ref> The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton's public house) but Mona was always looking for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller [[semi-detached]] house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroomed house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.<ref name="BestRoagPetep22"> Roag and Pete Best "The Beatles: The True Beginnings" 2003 p22</ref><ref>[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&time=&date=&ttype=&q=Princess+Dr,+Liverpool,+Merseyside+L14,+United+Kingdom&sll=54.162434,-3.647461&sspn=17.81631,31.289063&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=0,53.428714,-2.872355&ll=53.429225,-2.869234&spn=0.035286,0.061111&z=14&iwloc=addr&om=1 Princess Drive, Liverpol] google.co.uk/maps - Retrieved [[1 December]] [[2007]] </ref>

After moving to 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948—where the Bests lived for nine years—Rory saw a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman's Green, in 1957, and told Mona about it.<ref>[http://www.beatlestours.co.uk/Pete%20Best.htm 17 Queenscourt Road] beatlestours.co.uk - Retrieved [[1 December]] [[2007]] </ref> The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on a horse that was ridden by [[Lester Piggott]] in the [[Epsom Derby]] called, "Never Say Die", which won at 33-1, and used her winnings to buy a house in 1957.<ref name="BestHappyMan">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=447201&in_page_id=1773 Pete Best is a happy man - [[7 April]] [[2007]]] dailymail.co.uk - Retrieved [[5 November]] [[2007]] </ref> 8 Hayman's Green had previously been owned by the West Derby [[Association of Conservative Clubs|Conservative Club]], and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool, as the house (built around 1860) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an [[acre]] of land.<ref name="BestRoagPetep16"> Roag and Pete Best "The Beatles: The True Beginnings" 2003 p16</ref> All the rooms were painted dark green or brown, and the garden was totally overgrown.<ref name="Spitzp161"> Spitz 2005 p161</ref><ref name="MilesPage57"> Miles 1997 p57</ref><ref name="TheCasbahClub">[http://www.samleach.com/photos_beatles.html Photos of The Casbah Club] samleach.com - Retrieved [[10 October]] [[2007]] </ref> Mona decorated the living room in an [[Oriental]] style, which reflected her own upbringing in India.<ref name="Spitzp326"> Spitz 2005 p326</ref> She had previously tried to interest her husband in other houses, including a [[Formby]] lighthouse, a windmill in [[St. Helens]] and a circular house in [[Southport]], which were all rejected by Best as not being to his liking.<ref name="BestRoagPetep16"> Roag and Pete Best "The Beatles: The True Beginnings" 2003 p16</ref> 

During 1961-1962, Aspinall became good friends with Pete and subsequently rented a room in the Best's house. During one of the extended business trips of Pete's father, Aspinall became romantically involved with Mona, who was 20 years his senior.

==The Casbah Coffee Club==
[[Image:The Casbah Club.jpg|thumb|left|250px| The music area of The Casbah Coffee Club as it looks today.]]
Mona came up with the idea of the club after watching a TV report about [[The 2i's Coffee Bar]] in [[London]]'s [[Soho]] where several singers had been discovered. She decided to open The Casbah Coffee Club—which was located in her cellar—on [[29 August]] [[1959]], for young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day.<ref name="BillboardPeteBestBiog">[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1713012 Pete Best biog on Billboard - [[25 September]] [[2002]]] billboard.com - Retrieved [[10 October]] [[2007]] </ref><ref>[http://maxwelledison.blogspot.com/2005_10_16_maxwelledison_archive.html The Casbah Club] maxwelledison.blogspot.com - Retrieved [[29 January]] [[2007]] </ref> Mona charged [[half a crown]] annually for membership&mdash;to "keep out the rough elements"&mdash;and served soft drinks, snacks, cakes, and coffee from an [[espresso machine]], which no other club had at that time.<ref name="Spitzp160"> Spitz 2005 p160</ref><ref name="Liverpoolcradle"/><ref>[http://www.casbahcoffeeclub.com/default.asp?section=3,4 The Casbah Coffee Club coffee machine] casbahcoffeeclub.com  - Retrieved [[26 November]] [[2007]] </ref> The popular records of the day were played on a small [[Dansette]] record player, which amplified them through a [[inch|3"]] speaker.<ref>[http://www.casbahcoffeeclub.com/default.asp?section=3,1  Photo of the Dansette record player] casbahcoffeeclub.com - Retrieved [[1 December]] [[2007]] </ref> 

Mona had booked the [[The Quarrymen|Les Stewart Quartet]] to play the opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they cancelled the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club.<ref name="Spitzp161"> Spitz 2005 p161</ref> As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison said that he had two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead.<ref name="Spitzp161"> Spitz 2005 p161</ref> Lennon, McCartney, [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows and stars, but as Lennon was [[short-sighted]], he mistook [[Gloss (paint)|gloss]] for [[Paint|emulsion]] paint, which took a long time to dry in the dark, damp cellar. [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia Powell]], later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of him on the wall, which is also still there.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp43-44"> Cynthia Lennon “John” 2006 pp43-44</ref><ref name="CasbahListedStatus"/>  

The Quarrymen played a series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 [[shillings]] each, starting on [[29 August]] to October 1959, featuring Brown, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, but without a drummer, or a [[Public address|PA]] system.<ref name="Milesp51"> Miles 1997 p51</ref><ref name="CasbahPhotos">[http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1950s/59.08.29%20casbah/59.08.29casbah.html  Casbah photos] beatlesource.com - Retrieved [[4 November]] [[2007]] </ref> The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp44"> Cynthia Lennon “John” 2006 p44</ref> As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his [[Amplifier|40-Watt amplifier]].<ref name="Spitzp163"> Spitz 2005 p163</ref> After the success of the first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group [[£]]3 a night.<ref name="Spitzp162"> Spitz 2005 p162</ref> Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee.<ref name="Spitzp164"> Spitz 2005 p164</ref>   

Pete was studying at the Collegiate Grammar School when he decided he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks.<ref name="Spitzp161"> Spitz 2005 p161</ref><ref>[http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/liverpoolcollegiate  Icons: A Portrait of England] icons.org.uk - Retrieved [[26 November]] [[2007]] </ref><ref>[http://www.eskimo.com/~bpentium/beatles/besttape/besttape.html  Radio DJ Jim Ladd interview with Best] eskimo.com - Retrieved [[26 November]] [[2007]] </ref> Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen.<ref name="Spitzp4-5"> Spitz 2005 pp4-5</ref><ref name="CasbahPhotos"/><ref>[http://www.geocities.com/uheep2/casbah.htm Photo of record cover showing Ken Brown with Harrison, McCartney and Lennon] geocities.com - Retrieved [[4 November]] [[2007]] </ref> The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the [[influenza|flu]], so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel with the rest of the group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.<ref name="Spitzp164-165"> Spitz 2005 pp164-165</ref> Colin Manley from The Remo Four was also given a booking to play in the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time.<ref name="Spitzp162"> Spitz 2005 p162</ref> Other groups like [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]] and [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]] later played in the club.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/264205.stm Drinking coffee with the Beatles – [[27 January]] [[1999]]] news.bbc.co.uk - Retrieved [[26 November]] [[2007]] </ref> The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp44"> Cynthia Lennon “John” 2006 p44</ref> It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to use the prize money he had been given after winning an art competition to buy a [[Hofner]] President bass guitar and join The Quarrymen.<ref name="Torontosun">[http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/TorontoSun/Entertainment/2003/08/17/pf-162315.html Bill Harris article about The Casbah – [[17 August]] [[2003]]] canoe.ca/NewsStand/TorontoSun - Retrieved [[26 November]] [[2007]] </ref>  

Even though the membership list later spiralled to over a thousand, Mona closed the club on [[24 June]] [[1962]], with The Beatles as the last group to perform.<ref name="EndfOfTheCasbah">[http://www.casbahcoffeeclub.com/default.asp?section=3,4,3 The end of the club and the performers who played there] casbahcoffeeclub.com  - Retrieved [[29 November]] [[2007]] </ref> In 2006, the Best's ex-coal cellar was given a "Grade II listed building status", after being recommended by [[English Heritage]].<ref name="CasbahListedStatus">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/5348570.stm Beatles' club gets listed status - 15 September 2006]  news.bbc.co.uk - Retrieved [[3 November]] [[2007]] </ref> It has now been opened as a tourist attraction in Liverpool, along with McCartney and Lennon's previous homes.<ref name="ThemanwhowasaBeatle">[http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/07/best.beatles/index.html  The man who was a Beatle] cnn.com - Retrieved [[8 December]] [[2007]] </ref>

When Pete became a member of The Beatles, Mona repeatedly tried to get the group a lunchtime residency in The Cavern Club by talking to the owner, Ray McFall, but was turned down, as The Cavern had a jazz-only policy at the time.<ref name="Spitzp238"> Spitz 2005 p238</ref> [[Brian Epstein]] later wanted to manage the group, and Mona was asked for her advice, and although she had her own plans for the group, she concluded that Epstein would be good for them over time.<ref name="Spitzp274"> Spitz 2005 p274</ref> After The Beatles signed a management contract with Epstein, Mona did not relinquish her control over them, as they had been using her telephone to call agents, and frequently slept over in her living room between concerts.<ref name="Spitzp326"> Spitz 2005 p326</ref> She constantly harassed Epstein about the quality of their bookings, and his management of them, which led to Epstein never referring to her by name, but always calling her "''that woman''".<ref name="Spitzp231"> Spitz 2005 p231</ref> One musician commented that if Mona said it was a Sunday when it was Tuesday, one would be forced to agree with her.<ref name="Spitzp326"> Spitz 2005 p326</ref> 

After Best, McCartney and Harrison were [[deportation|deported]] from Hamburg in November 1960, Mona made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group's equipment, which she eventually managed to do.<ref name="MilesPage72-73"> Miles 1997 pp72-73</ref><ref> Lewisohn 1990 p24</ref><ref name=”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”> ”The Beatles Anthology” DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:49:56) Notice telling Harrison to leave Hamburg.</ref> Mona wrote to [[Granada Television]] in 1961, in an attempt to get the group a television appearance on the programme called "People And Places", but was sent a letter telling her that they would contact her in the future.<ref name="HarryBeatlesEncyclopedia"> Harry 2001 - The Beatles’ Encyclopedia</ref> After her son had been dismissed from The Beatles on [[16 August]] [[1962]], Mona was later quoted by biographer [[Hunter Davies]] as saying: {{cquote |He'd [Pete] been their manager before Brian [Epstein] arrived, did the bookings and collected the money. I'd looked upon them as friends. I'd helped them so much, got them bookings, lending them money. I fed them when they were hungry. I was far more interested in them than their own parents.<ref name="HarryBeatlesEncyclopedia"> Harry 2001 - The Beatles’ Encyclopedia</ref>}}

==Later years==
In 1967, when The Beatles had to pose for the photograph for the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' cover, Lennon asked Mona if he could borrow the war medals her father had been given in India to wear for the photo session. Although still upset at the way her son was dismissed from The Beatles, Mona agreed, and the medals were then returned, along with a [[Cash Box magazine|Cash Box]] trophy that is in the letter 'L' of THE BEATLES flower-sign on the cover.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/6712859.stm The Medals] news.bbc.co.uk - Retrieved [[23 November]] [[2007]] </ref><ref name="Torontosun"/> Mona never opened another club, or engaged in another business venture, although she did have paying guests at her house, which she shared with her bed-ridden mother and her sons after she and Best parted.<ref name="PhilipNormanGenerationp1"> Philip Norman "Shout: The Beatles in Their Generation" 1996 p60</ref> Mona died of a heart attack [[9 September]] [[1988]], after a long illness.<ref name="ThemanwhowasaBeatle"/>
