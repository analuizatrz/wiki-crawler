[[Image:unclebusscreenshot.jpg|right|thumb|A screenshot of the Bus Uncle video with subtitles added.]]
"'''The Bus Uncle'''" ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 巴士阿叔) is a [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] [[video clip]] of an argument between an old man and a young bespectacled man aboard a bus in [[Hong Kong]] on [[April 27]], [[2006]]. The title was coined by members of an Internet forum in reference to the belligerent character in the video. Contrary to reports in Western media,<ref name="WP">{{cite news

==Incident==

The incident took place on the top level of a [[double decker]]<ref name="CNNrp" /> [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], Route 68X<ref name="WP" /> en route to [[Yuen Long]] at approximately 11:00 p.m. on [[27 April]], [[2006]].<ref name=SCMP1>{{cite news

The man in front reacted furiously and an argument ensued. The younger man, who seldom talked back during the quarrel, expressed reluctance to carry on the discussion. However, the middle-aged man insisted that the matter was not settled, ranting on about how angry he was being provoked under stress. The younger man apologised after being asked to and reluctantly shook hands, but received more profanities<ref name="AP" /> after warning the older man regarding the use of [[mother insult]]s.<ref name="WSJ" /> Despite the strong language and the Bus Uncle's threats of violence, a physical altercation never seemed imminent. It ended when the older man's phone rang again.

In [[Chinese culture]], it is common for a person to refer an older person as "阿叔", roughly translated as "Uncle". The English title of the video is hence called "The Bus Uncle".  The name is also a reference to [[Football (soccer)|football]] commentator [[Lam Sheung Yee]] (林尚義), who is nicknamed "阿叔" and whose voice resembles Chan's: the name "尚義" appears as part of the title of the original video.<ref name="original-youtube"/>

[[Image:Bus Uncle B.jpg|right|thumb|Elvis Ho in his office.]]

===Young man (Elvis Ho Yui Hei)===
The young man scolded in the video is Elvis Ho Yui Hei ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 何銳熙), a property agent of his family's property management company in [[Mong Kok]]. On [[May 23]], [[2006]], Ho (previously misidentified as "Alvin" or "Elvin") called a talk show on [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]] claiming to be the young man involved in the argument. In a later interview with the [[South China Morning Post]], Ho said he often takes long bus rides home and would frequently ask passengers to lower their voices so he could take a nap. Despite having been threatened, Ho said he forgave "Bus Uncle" and sympathised with whatever stress the older man was suffering.<ref name=SCMP1/>

The man who recorded the video clip has been identified as Jon Fong Wing Hang ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 方穎恆), a 21-year-old accountant and part-time psychology student,<ref name="WP" /> after he called a radio station on [[May 25]], [[2006]]. Fong, who recorded the incident with a [[Sony Ericsson]] [[Sony Ericsson W800|W800]]i mobile phone, claimed there was a second video yet to be posted online in which Ho fought back by making fun of "Bus Uncle" with a friend on the phone.  Fong stated that the reason for the recording was to provide evidence to the police in case "Bus Uncle" became physically violent.<ref>{{cite news

==Aftermath==
Chan stated that when Ho tapped him on the shoulder, he was under duress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]] suicide-prevention hotline for support. However, Ho claimed that Chan was just chatting with friends.<ref>{{cite news|title=巴士阿叔痛哭　「我想自殺」 (Bus Uncle sobs, "I want to commit suicide!")|publisher=[[Next Magazine]]|url = http://next.atnext.com/template/next/sec_main.cfm?iss_id=847&sec_id=1000853|id=Issue No. 847|date=[[2006-05-31]]|accessdate=2007-04-20|language=[[Traditional Chinese]]}}</ref> ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' reported that Chan visited Ho's office on [[May 31]], [[2006]] in [[Mong Kok]] to apologise for the dispute and to initiate a business proposal for the duo to hold a "Bus Uncle Rave Party". Allegedly, Chan was quickly rejected and expelled by Ho, who expressed outrage towards the journalists who arranged the meeting and threatened legal action against the press.<ref name="Bus Uncle Bio"/>

On [[June 7]], [[2006]], Chan, who had been hired by a restaurant as a Public Relations officer, was physically assaulted on-the-job in front of horrified diners by three unidentified masked men who then fled the scene.<ref name ="beaten"/> He sustained severe injuries to his eyes and face and was admitted to the emergency department for treatment. The restaurant owner, Mr. Lee, then faced pressure from his wife and daughter to fire Chan due to magazine coverage of Chan's exploits in a [[Shenzhen]] karaoke [[hostess bar]]. Lee's initial refusal led to his wife's suicide attempt through drug overdose on [[June 11]] in order to force the issue.<ref>{{cite news|title=「扒后」林珍奇仰藥逼炒巴士阿叔 (The "Steak Queen" attempts suicide through drug overdose to force the dismissal of the Bus Uncle)|publisher=[[Wen Wei Po]]|url=http://www.wenweipo.com/news.phtml?news_id=HK0606120009&loc=LU&cat=583BS&no_combo=1|accessdate=2007-04-21| language = [[Traditional Chinese]]}}</ref> Having learnt of the incident, Chan resigned, saying he did not want Lee's family to be unhappy.

==Social impacts==
===International coverage===
The video clip, though subtitled in English (erroneously in parts), never strayed far from the general tenor of the Cantonese version. News of the video clip has penetrated Western media and has been widely syndicated, and reported in prominent international journals in late May 2006, such as [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[CNN]], and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name="beaten"/><ref name="CNNrp">{{cite news

The famous quotes of Bus Uncle are now frequently used, mimicked, and parodied in Hong Kong, particularly by teenagers. A radio talk show host of Commercial Radio Hong Kong mentioned an incident involving his friend, a teacher, and his students at the end of an examination. Once the time was up, a student yelled, "It's not settled! It's not settled! It's not settled!", refusing to stop writing. It was only when another teacher replied, "You may be stressed, but so am I," did the student agree to stop.<ref>{{cite episode

In June 2006, TVB television made a parody of the Bus Uncle video in its television promotion for its coverage of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], which featured its sports commentator Lam Sheung Yee (林尚義), whose voice resembles Chan's, on a bus playing the role of the Bus Uncle. In the promotion, a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung Yee (played by Lam Man Chung) questions whether Lam Sheung Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup, which would be his last TV appearance before retirement. Turning around, Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasises that the issue (i.e. the viewers' demand for World Cup coverage) has been resolved.  The passenger then offers to shake hands with Lam Sheung Yee and calls for a truce.<ref>{{cite video

[[Sitcom]]s of [[Asia Television Limited|ATV]] and TVB also imitated the video in argument scenes. In episode 67 of the TVB sitcom ''[[w:zh:高朋滿座|Welcome to the House]]'', the young bespecled main character tried to stop a man from talking too loudly on the mobile phone in the cinema. As a result, he was harshly rebuked by the man. Once his family knew about the incident from a video uploaded on the internet, they taught the character to be more assertive and not to allow himself to be bullied. In the end, he was able to stand up to the same man when they met again in the cinema and remove him from the premises.<ref>{{cite episode

===A closer look at life in Hong Kong===
Although many found the video humorous and entertaining, others warned that it hints at a more alarming and sinister prognosis of life in stress-filled Hong Kong. The fact that it was runner-up "Person of the Year" announced by [[Radio Television Hong Kong|RTHK]] indicated that it may have struck a chord with the general population.<ref>{{cite news

[[To Kit]], a well-known columnist and broadcaster, made a commentary about the incident on Commercial Radio. He described the behavior of Bus Uncle as "a noise raping" and said that the incident was the manifestation of underlying social tension as well as the mindset of a common Chinese person. He criticised Elvis' speechlessness as being too weak, likewise a stereotype of present-day Hong Kong youth. In addition, he noted that the incident implied that harmony in the neighborhood was somehow upset.<ref>{{cite episode

Dr. Lee Sing, director of the [[Hong Kong Mood Disorders Centre]] at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that Hong Kong's high-stress working environments are spawning a city-full of "Bus Uncles".

Dr. Ng Fung Sheung, a social science lecturer of the [[City University of Hong Kong]], explained that Hong Kong people tend to chat loudly in public places. She attributed this phenomenon to the television screens found in many vehicles and trains, which broadcast programmes at high volumes. She suggested that the government should provide better civic education for the public to make them more considerate of others. When it comes to schools which banned the usage of catch phrases like "I'm stressed!" Dr. Ng stated that teachers must be able to distinguish whether the students really face pressure or are simply following the trend, and provide guidance if necessary.<ref>{{cite news

Some denied that any social insight could be gleamed from the video clip, arguing that the frenzy was artificially created by sensationalist newspapers in order to boost circulation and profits.
