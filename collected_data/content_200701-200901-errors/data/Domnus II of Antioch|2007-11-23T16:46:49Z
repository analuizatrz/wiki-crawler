'''Domnus II''', [[Patriarch of Antioch]] of the heavily religious [[Eastern Roman Empire]], and a friend of the influential [[Theodoret|Saint Theodoret Bishop of Cyrrhus]]. He was nephew of [[John of Antioch|John I]], Patriarch of Antioch, brought up under [[Euthymius]] the famous hermit of [[Palestine]]. He was ordained deacon by [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]] on his visit to the Laura of Euthymus in [[429 AD]]. On the death of his uncle, in [[441 AD]], he was elected his successor, and almost at once ranked as the chief bishop of the Eastern world.
 
In [[445 AD]] he summoned a synod of Syrian bishops which confirmed the deposition of [[Athanasius of Perrha]]. In [[447 AD]] he consecrated [[Irenaeus of Tyre|Irenaeus]] to the see of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] (Theodoret, ''Epistle'' 110); but emperor [[Theodosius II]], commanded that the appointment should be annulled on the grounds that [[Irenaeus]] was both a ''digamus'' and a supporter of [[Nestorianism]]. He defended [[Ibas]], bishop of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], against charges of promulgating Nestorian doctrines, and summoned a council at Antioch ([[448]]) which decided in favor of Ibas and deposed his accusers. Domnus's sentence, though revoked by [[Flavian of Constantinople|Flavian]], [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], was confirmed by three episcopal commissioners to whom he and the emperor [[Theodosius]] had committed the matter. 

As a result, he was deposed at the schismatic [[Second Council of Ephesus]] on [[August 8]], [[449]]. Cowed by the authoritarian spirit of [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Dioscorus]], and unnerved by the violence of Barsumas and his monks, Domnus revoked his former condemnation of [[Eutyches]], and voted for the condemnation of [[Flavian]], but in vain. He was the only bishop then deposed and banished who was not reinstated after the [[Council of Chalcedon]]&mdash;though this may have been by request so he could retire to his beloved monastery. 

At that council [[Maximus II of Antioch|Maximus II]], his successor in the see of Antioch, obtained permission to assign Domnus a pension from the revenues of the church, and on his recall from exile Domnus returned to the monastic home of his youth, ending his days in the [[Laura of St. Euthymius]], where in [[452 AD]], according to [[Theophanes]], he afforded a refuge to [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]] when he was driven from his see (Theophanes, p. 92).
