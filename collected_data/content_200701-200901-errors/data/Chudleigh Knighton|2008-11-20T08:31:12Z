'''Chudleigh Knighton''' is a small village in [[Devon]], [[England]], near to [[Newton Abbot]] and [[Bovey Tracey]].  It is served by transport links in the form of bus services both from Newton Abbot and [[Exeter]]. The village used to have a railway station, Chudleigh Knighton Halt, on the [[Teign Valley Line]]. The station opened on 9 June 1924 but was closed on 9 June 1958.<ref>{{cite book| last = Oakley| first = Mike| title = Devon Railway Stations| publisher = The Dovecote Press| date = 2007| location = Wimbourne| id = ISBN 1-904349-55-6}}</ref>

The nearby [[Chudleigh Knighton Heath]], a [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Devon|Site of Special Scientific Interest]], is a habitat for many rare species including the ant, ''[[Formica exsecta]]''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_3518000/3518751.stm "A colony of a rare species of ant has been returned to its home in Devon six years after it was rescued by Paignton Zoo"], [[BBC News]], 25 February 2004.</ref><ref name="WBB Minerals lease">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11888160_ITM "Quarry company extends lease of heathland nature reserve"], [[Western Daily Press]], 29 November 2005.</ref> The Heath was once the village's main football pitch and was the venue for many sports days for Chudleigh Knighton Church of England Primary School. However the Heath got so run down, it became almost impossible to navigate, so the School opened it's own private sports field opposite to the village play park.

Chudleigh Knighton Church of England Primary School currently has around 80 pupils, aged 5 to 11. The school has 4 classrooms spread over 2 floors.
