{{nihongo|'''''Sudoku'''''|数独|sūdoku}} ''{{Audio|Sudoku.ogg|listen}}'' is a [[logic]]-based number-placement [[puzzle]]. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 boxes (also called blocks or regions) contains the digits from 1 to 9 only ''one'' time each. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid.

Completed ''Sudoku'' puzzles are usually a type of [[Latin square]] with an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. [[Leonhard Euler]] is sometimes incorrectly cited as the source of the puzzle, based on his related work with Latin squares.<ref>{{cite web

<!-- Incorrectly because Latin squares are not puzzles. -->

The modern puzzle was invented by an American architect, [[Howard Garns]], in 1979 and published by [[Dell Magazines]] under the name "Number Place".<ref>{{cite web

== History ==

[[Image:Sudoku.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Page from ''La France'' newspaper, July 6, 1895.]]   

Number puzzles first appeared in newspapers in the late 19th century, when French puzzle setters began experimenting with removing numbers from [[magic squares]]. ''Le Siècle'', a Paris-based daily, published a partially completed 9×9 magic square with 3×3 sub-squares in 1892.<ref name="La_Siècle_1892">{{cite journal | last = Boyer | first = Christian | year = 2006 | month = May | title = Supplément de l’article « Les ancêtres français du sudoku » | journal = Pour la Science | pages = 1–6 | url = http://www.pourlascience.com/complement/pdf/Suppl%20Ancetres%20Sudoku.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-09-16}}</ref>  It was not a Sudoku because it contained double-digit numbers and required arithmetic rather than logic to solve, but it shared key characteristics: each row, column and sub-square added up to the same number.

Within three years ''Le Siècle's'' rival, ''La France'', refined the puzzle so that it was almost a modern Sudoku. It simplified the 9×9 magic square puzzle so that each row and column contained only the numbers 1–9, but did not mark the sub-squares. Although they are unmarked, each 3×3 sub-square does indeed comprise the numbers 1–9. However, the puzzle cannot be considered the first Sudoku because, under modern rules, it has two solutions. The puzzle setter ensured a unique solution by requiring 1–9 to appear in both diagonals.

These weekly puzzles were a feature of newspaper titles including ''L'Echo de Paris'' for about a decade but disappeared about the time of the [[First World War]].<ref name=L>{{cite news | first = Jack | last = Malvern | title = Les fiendish French beat us to Su Doku | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2208881,00.html | work = Times Online | date = 2006-06-03 | accessdate = 2006-09-16}}</ref>   

According to [[Will Shortz]], the modern Sudoku was most likely designed anonymously by [[Howard Garns]], a 74-year-old retired architect and freelance puzzle constructor from [[Indiana]], and first published in 1979 by [[Dell Magazines]] as ''Number Place'' (the earliest known examples of modern Sudoku). Garns's name was always present on the list of contributors in issues of ''Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games'' that included ''Number Place'', and was always absent from issues that did not.<ref name="Garns">{{cite web | url = http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_09_05_05.html | title = Ed Pegg Jr.'s Math Games: Sudoku Variations | accessmonthday = October 3 | accessyear = 2006 | last = Pegg | first = Ed, Jr. | date = 2005-09-15 | work = MAA Online | publisher = The Mathematical Association of America }}</ref> He died in 1989 before getting a chance to see his creation as a worldwide phenomenon.<ref name="Garns"/> It is unclear if Garns was familiar with any of the French newspapers listed above.

The puzzle was introduced in Japan by [[Nikoli]] in the paper ''Monthly Nikolist'' in April 1984<ref name="Garns"/> as {{nihongo|''Suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru''|数字は独身に限る|}}, which can be translated as "the digits must be single" or "the digits are limited to one occurrence." At a later date, the name was abbreviated to ''Sudoku'' by {{nihongo|[[Maki Kaji]]|鍜治 真起|Kaji Maki}}, taking only the first [[kanji]] of compound words to form a shorter version.<ref name="Garns"/> In 1986, Nikoli introduced two innovations: the number of givens was restricted to no more than 32, and puzzles became "symmetrical" (meaning the givens were distributed in rotationally symmetric cells).  It is now published in mainstream Japanese periodicals, such as the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]''.

== Variants ==

[[Image:A nonomino sudoku.svg|thumb|150px|A nonomino ''Sudoku'' puzzle, sometimes also known as a [[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] Sudoku, for instance in the [[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]].]]
[[Image:A nonomino sudoku solution.svg|thumb|150px|Solution numbers in red for above puzzle.]]

Although the 9×9 grid with 3×3 regions is by far the most common, variations abound.  Sample puzzles can be 4×4 grids with 2×2 regions; 5×5 grids with [[pentomino]] regions have been published under the name ''Logi-5''; the [[World Puzzle Championship]] has featured a 6×6 grid with 2×3 regions and a 7×7 grid with six [[heptomino]] regions and a disjoint region. Larger grids are also possible. The ''Times'' offers a 12×12-grid ''Dodeka sudoku'' with 12 regions of 4×3 squares. Dell regularly publishes 16×16 ''Number Place Challenger'' puzzles (the 16×16 variant often uses 1 through G rather than the 0 through F used in [[hexadecimal]]). Nikoli offers 25×25 ''Sudoku the Giant'' behemoths. 

Another common variant is to add limits on the placement of numbers beyond the usual row, column, and box requirements.  Often the limit takes the form of an extra "dimension"; the most common is to require the numbers in the main diagonals of the grid also to be unique.  The aforementioned ''Number Place Challenger'' puzzles are all of this variant, as are the ''Sudoku X'' puzzles in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', which use 6×6 grids.  

A variant named "Mini Sudoku" appears in the American newspaper ''[[USA Today]]'', which is played on a 6x6 grid with 3x2 regions. The object is the same as standard Sudoku, but the puzzle only uses the numbers 1 through 6.

Another variant is the combination of Sudoku with [[Kakuro]] on a 9 x 9 grid, called Cross Sums Sudoku, in which clues are given in terms of cross sums. The clues can also be given by cryptic [[alphametics]] in which each letter represents a single digit from 0 to 9. An excellent example is  NUMBER+NUMBER=KAKURO which has a unique solution 186925+186925=373850. Another example is SUDOKU=IS*FUNNY whose solution is 426972=34*12558. 

[[Killer Sudoku]] combines elements of Sudoku with Kakuro - usually no initial numbers are given, but the 9*9 grid is divided into regions, each with a number that the sum of all numbers in the region must add up to, with no repeated numerals. These must be filled in while obeying the standard rules of Sudoku.

[[Image:Oceans Hypersudoku18 Solution.svg|thumb|150px|Solution to [[Hypersudoku]] puzzle.]]
[[Hypersudoku]] is one of the most popular variants. It is published by news papers and magazines around the world and is also known as "[[NRC Handelsblad|NRC]] Sudoku", "Windoku", "Hyper-Sudoku" and "4 Square Sudoku". The layout is identical to a normal Sudoku, but with additional interior areas defined in which the numbers 1 to 9 must appear. The solving algorithm is slightly different from the normal Sudoku puzzles because of the leverage on the overlapping squares. This overlap gives the player more information to logically reduce the possibilities in the remaining squares. The approach to playing is still similar to Sudoku but with possibly more emphasis on scanning the squares and overlap rather than columns and rows. 

Puzzles constructed from multiple Sudoku grids are common. Five 9×9 grids which overlap at the corner regions in the shape of a [[quincunx]] is known in Japan as Gattai 5 (five merged) Sudoku. In ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Age]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' this form of puzzle is known as ''Samurai SuDoku''. The [[Baltimore Sun]] and the [[Toronto Star]] publish a puzzle of this variant (titled ''High Five'') in their Sunday edition. Often, no givens are to be found in overlapping regions. Sequential grids, as opposed to overlapping, are also published, with values in specific locations in grids needing to be transferred to others.

Alphabetical variations have emerged; there is no functional difference in the puzzle unless the letters spell something.  Some variants, such as in the ''[[TV Guide]]'', include a word reading along a main diagonal, row, or column once solved; determining the word in advance can be viewed as a solving aid.  A looser variant on the sudoku concept is seen in [[Squaro]], wherein circles at the vertices of a grid are filled in to meet the requirements of numbers in that grid in a combination of sudoku and [[minesweeper (computer game)|minesweeper]].

A tabletop version of Sudoku can be played with a standard 81-card Set deck (see [[Set game]]).  A three-dimensional ''Sudoku'' puzzle was invented by [[Dion Church]] and published in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' in May 2005. There is a Sudoku version of the [[Rubik's Cube]] named [[Sudoku Cube]].

The 2005 U.S. Puzzle Championship included a variant called ''Digital Number Place'': rather than givens, most cells contain a partial given—a segment of a number, with the numbers drawn as if part of a [[seven-segment display]]. This version has also appeared in [[GAMES magazine]].

One more variant of Sudoku is Greater Than Sudoku (GT Sudoku). In this a 3x3 grid of the Sudoku is given with 12 symbols of Greater Than (>) or Less Than (<) on the common line of the two adjacent numbers. Depending on difficulty this type of Sudoku may or may not be given with numbers.

== Mathematics of Sudoku ==
:{{main|Mathematics of Sudoku}}

A completed ''Sudoku'' grid is a special type of [[Latin square]] with the additional property of no repeated values in any partition of the 9×9 block into contiguous 3×3 blocks. The relationship between the two theories is now completely known, after Denis Berthier proved in his recent book, "The Hidden Logic of Sudoku", that a first order formula that does not mention blocks (also called boxes or regions) is valid for Sudoku if and only if it is valid for Latin Squares (this property is trivially true for the axioms and it can be extended to any formula).

The first known calculation of the number of classic 9×9 ''Sudoku'' solution grids was posted on the [[USENET]] newsgroup ''rec.puzzles'' in September 2003<ref name=QSCGZ_2003-3>{{cite web | url = http://groups.google.co.uk/group/rec.puzzles/browse_thread/thread/3ba62ed2d76a052/94ce2b94b84f4e53?lnk=st&q=6670903752021072936960++#94ce2b94b84f4e53 | title = Combinatorial question on 9x9 | accessmonthday = September | accessyear = 2003 | work = Google newsgroups archive }}</ref> and is 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 {{OEIS|id=A107739}}. This is roughly {{val|1.2|e=-6}} times the number of 9×9 Latin squares. A detailed calculation of this figure was provided by Bertram Felgenhauer and Frazer Jarvis in 2005.<ref name=Jarvis_2006-07-31>{{cite web | url = http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/sudoku/ | title = Sudoku enumeration problems | accessmonthday = September 16 | accessyear = 2006 | last = Jarvis | first = Frazer | date = 2006-07-31 | work = Frazer Jarvis's home page}}</ref> Various other grid sizes have also been enumerated—see the [[Mathematics of Sudoku#Enumeration results|main article]] for details.  The number of ''essentially different'' solutions, when [[symmetry|symmetries]] such as rotation, reflection and relabelling are taken into account, was shown by Ed Russell and Frazer Jarvis to be just 5,472,730,538<ref name=Jarvis_and_Russell>{{cite web | url = http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/sudoku/sudgroup.html | title = There are 5472730538 essentially different Sudoku grids ... and the Sudoku symmetry group | accessmonthday = September 16 | accessyear = 2006 | last = Jarvis | first = Frazer | coauthors = Ed Russell | date = 2005-09-07 | work = Frazer Jarvis's home page}}</ref> {{OEIS|id=A109741}}.

The maximum number of givens provided while still not rendering a unique solution is four short of a full grid; if two instances of two numbers each are missing and the cells they are to occupy form the corners of an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, there are two ways the numbers can be assigned.  Since this applies to Latin squares in general, most variants of ''Sudoku'' have the same maximum.  The inverse problem—the fewest givens that render a solution unique—is [[unsolved problems in mathematics|unsolved]], although the lowest number yet found for the standard variation without a symmetry constraint is 17, a number of which have been found by Japanese puzzle enthusiasts,<ref name=seventeen1>{{cite web | url = http://www2.ic-net.or.jp/~takaken/auto/guest/bbs46.html | title = プログラミングパズルに関心のある人は雑談しましょう | accessmonthday = September 16 | accessyear = 2006 | work = プログラミングパズル雑談コーナー / Programming Puzzle Idle Talk Corner | language = Japanese }}</ref><ref name=seventeen2>{{cite web | url = http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~gordon/sudokumin.php | title = Minimum Sudoku | accessmonthday = September 16 | accessyear = 2006 | last = Royle | first = Gordon }}</ref> and 18 with the givens in rotationally symmetric cells.  Over 47,000 examples of Sudokus with 17 givens resulting in a unique solution are known.

== Recent popularity ==
In 1997, retired [[Hong Kong]] judge [[Wayne Gould]], 59, a [[New Zealand]]er, saw a partly completed puzzle in a Japanese bookshop. Over six years he developed a computer program to produce puzzles quickly. Knowing that British newspapers have a long history of publishing [[crossword]]s and other puzzles, he promoted ''Sudoku'' to ''[[The Times]]'' in Britain, which launched it on [[12 November]] [[2004]] (calling it ''Su Doku''). The first letter to The Times regarding Su Doku was published the following day on [[13 November]] from Ian Payn of [[Brentford]], complaining that the puzzle had caused him to miss his stop on the [[London Underground|tube]].

The rapid rise of ''Sudoku'' in Britain from relative obscurity to a front-page feature in national newspapers attracted commentary in the media and parody (such as when ''The Guardian'''s ''G2'' section advertised itself as the first newspaper supplement with a ''Sudoku'' grid on every page<ref name=G2>{{cite news | title = G2, home of the discerning Sudoku addict | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1482817,00.html | work = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Limited | date = 2005-05-13 | accessdate = 2006-09-16}}</ref>). Recognizing the different psychological appeals of easy and difficult puzzles, ''The Times'' introduced both side by side on [[20 June]] [[2005]]. From July 2005, [[Channel 4]] included a daily ''Sudoku'' game in their [[Teletext]] service. On [[2 August]], the BBC's programme guide ''[[Radio Times]]'' featured a weekly [[Super Sudoku]] which features a 16x16 grid.

Even the Greeks owe the publication of their first Sudoku magazine to British influence. It was at Heathrow airport in the middle of 2005 that a [[Compupress|Greek computer magazine]] publisher first laid eyes on a British Sudoku magazine and - realizing the opportunity - proceeded to purchase the necessary software and quickly launch the first local Sudoku magazine, which became an instant success.

In the United States, the first newspaper to publish a Sudoku puzzle by Wayne Gould was [[The Conway Daily Sun]] (New Hampshire), in 2004.<ref>''New York Times'' corrections column, [[April 2]], 2007, p. A2</ref>

[[Image:SudokuLive2.jpg|thumb|250px|The world's first live TV ''Sudoku'' show, [[1 July]] [[2005]], Sky One.]]   

The world's first live TV ''Sudoku'' show, ''Sudoku Live'', was a [[puzzle contest]] first broadcast on [[1 July]] [[2005]] on [[Sky One]]. It was presented by [[Carol Vorderman]]. Nine teams of nine players (with one celebrity in each team) representing geographical regions competed to solve a puzzle. Each player had a hand-held device for entering numbers corresponding to answers for four cells. Phil Kollin of Winchelsea, England was the series grand prize winner taking home over £23,000 over a series of games. The audience at home was in a separate interactive competition, which was won by Hannah Withey of Cheshire.

Later in 2005, the [[BBC]] launched [[SUDO-Q]], a [[game show]] that combines Sudoku with general knowledge.  However, it uses only 4x4 and 6x6 puzzles..

In 2006, a Sudoku website published songwriter Peter Levy's Sudoku tribute song,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sudoku.org.uk/news.htm|title=Sudoku the song, by Peter Levy|date=2006-08-17|work=[[Sudoku.org.uk]]|accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> but quickly had to take down the mp3 due to heavy traffic. British and Australian radio picked up the song, which is to feature in a British-made Sudoku documentary. The Japanese Embassy also nominated the song for an award, with Levy doing talks with Sony in Japan to release the song as a single.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20152238-28957,00.html|title=Hit Song Has the Numbers|date=2006-08-17|work=[[The Herald Sun]]|accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref>

Sudoku software is very popular on PCs, websites, and mobile phones. It comes with many distributions of Linux. Software has also been released on video game consoles, such as the [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation Portable]], the [[Game Boy Advance]], Xbox Live Arcade, several [[iPod]] models, and the [[iPhone]]. In fact, just two weeks after [[Apple, Inc.]] debuted the online [[App Store]] within its iTunes store on July 11, 2008, there were already nearly 30 different Sudoku games, created by various software developers, specifically for the iPhone and iPod Touch. One of the most popular video games featuring Sudoku is ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''. Critically and commercially well received, it generated particular praise for its Sudoku implementation[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/931667.asp][http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/brainagetrainyourbraininminutesaday/review.html][http://ds.ign.com/articles/702/702057p1.html] and sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6160557.html] Due to its popularity, Nintendo made a second Brain Age game titled Brain Age<sup>2</sup>, which has over 100 new sudoku puzzles and other activities.

In June 2008 an [[Australia]]n drugs-related [[jury trial]] costing over [[AU$]]1 000 000 was aborted when it was discovered that five of the twelve jurors had been playing Sudoku instead of listening to evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/jurors-get-1-million-trial-aborted/2008/06/10/1212863636766.html|title=The game's up: jurors playing Sudoku abort trial|last=Knox|first=Malcolm|date=2008-06-11|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>
