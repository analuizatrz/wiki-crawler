'''Piacenza''' ('''Placentia''' in [[Latin]] and old-fashioned [[English language|English]], '''Piasëinsa''' in the local [[dialects of Italy|dialect]] of [[Emiliano-Romagnolo]]) is a [[city]] in the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of northern [[Italy]]. It is the capital of the [[province of Piacenza]].

==History==
===Ancient history===
Before its settlement by the Romans, the area was populated by [[Celt]]ic and [[Ligurian]] tribes. The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] were well known for the practice of divining by the entrails of [[sheep]]. A [[bronze]] [[sculpture]] of a liver called the "[[Liver of Piacenza]]" was discovered in [[1877]] near Piacenza complete with the name of regions marked on it which were assigned to various [[gods]]. It has been connected to the practice of [[Haruspex|haruspicy]]. Piacenza was founded in [[218 BC]] (according to the tradition, on [[May 31]]), the first of the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[military colony|military colonies]], and was formerly called '''Placentia''' in both [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[English language|English]].

In Placentia and the nearby colony, [[Cremona]], 6,000 Latin colonists were sent, in particular members of the Equestrian class of Rome. In the same year as the city's founding, [[Hannibal]] won the [[Battle of Trebbia]] in Piacenza's area, but the city resisted the [[Punic]] forces. In the following years the city's territory was drained and a port was constructed onto the [[Po River]]. Placentia flourished as a production centre for grain, barley, millet, and wool. Although sacked and devastated several times, the city always recovered and as late as the [[6th century]] [[Procopius]] called it ''Urbs Aemilia Princeps'', namely the "Princess of the cities across the [[Via Aemilia]]", meaning "first city across the Via Aemilia".

The era of [[Late Antiquity]] in Piacenza (c. 300-700/800 AD) was marked by the expansion of [[Christianity]], with the presence of several martyrs. The current patron saint, Antoninus, was a former [[Roman legion|legionnaire]] who Christianized the area and was killed during the reign of [[Diocletian]].

===Middle Ages===
Piacenza was sacked during the course of the [[Gothic War (535–552)|Gothic War]]s (535–552). After a short period as a [[Byzantine Empire]] city, it was conquered by the [[Lombards]], who made it a duchy seat. After the [[Frankish Empire|Frank]] conquest ([[9th century]]) the city began to recover, aided by its location along the [[Via Francigena]] that connected the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with [[Rome]]. Its population and importance grew further after the year [[1000]]. That period marked a gradual transfer of governing powers from the feudal lords to a new enterprising class, as well to the feudal class of the countryside.

In [[1095]] the city was the site of the [[Council of Piacenza]], in which the [[First Crusade]] was proclaimed. From [[1126]] Piacenza was a free [[medieval commune|commune]] and an important member of the [[Lombard League]]. In this role it took part in the war against the emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] and in the subsequent [[battle of Legnano]] ([[1176]]). It also successfully fought the neighbouring communes of [[Cremona]], [[Pavia]] and [[Parma]], expanding its possessions. Piacenza also captured control of the trading routes with [[Genoa]], where the first Piacentini bankers had already settled, from the Malaspina counts and the bishop of [[Bobbio]].

In the [[13th century]], despite unsuccessful wars against emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], Piacenza managed to gain strongholds on the [[Lombardy]] shore of the [[Po River]]. The primilaries of the [[Peace of Constance]] were signed in [[1183]] in the Saint Antoninus church. Agriculture and trade flourished in these centuries, and Piacenza became one of the richest cities in Europe. This is reflected in the construction of many important buildings and in the general revision of the urban plan. Struggles for control were commonplace in the second half of the 13th century, not unlike the large majority of Medieval Italian communes. The Scotti family, [[Pallavicino]] family and [[Alberto Scoto]] (1290-1313) held power in that order during the period. Scoto's government ended when the [[Visconti]] of [[Milan]] captured Piacenza, which they would hold until [[1447]]. Duke [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti|Gian Galeazzo]] rewrote Piacenza's statutes and relocated the [[University of Pavia]] to the city. Piacenza then became a [[Sforza]] possession until [[1499]].

===Modern era===
A coin from the [[16th century]] shows the motto: ''Placentia floret'' ("Piacenza flourishes"). The city was in fact developing further, mainly thanks to the produce from its countryside. Also in the course of that century a new wall line was erected. Piacenza was under [[France]] until [[1521]], and later, with [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]], became briefly part of the [[Papal States]]. In [[1545]], finally, it was included in the new-born [[Duchy of Parma and Piacenza]], led by the [[Farnese]] family.

Piacenza was the capital city of the duchy until [[Ottavio Farnese, duke of Parma|Ottavio Farnese]] (1547-[[1586]]) moved it to Parma. The city lived its most grievous years under duke [[Odoardo Farnese|Odoardo]] ([[1622]]-[[1646]]): 6,000 and 13,000 Piacentini out of 30,000 died of famine and plague, respectively. The city and its countryside were also ravaged by bandits and French soldiers.

From [[1732]] to [[1859]] Parma and Piacenza were ruled by [[House of Bourbon]]. In the [[18th century]], ducal family living in Parma, several edifices which belonged to noble families such as Scotti, Landi and Fogliani were built in Piacenza.

In [[1802]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s army annexed Piacenza to the French Empire. The young Piacentini recruits were sent to fight in Russia, [[Spain]] and [[Germany]], while the city was spoiled of a great number of artworks which are currently exhibited in many French museums.

The [[Habsburg]] government of [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Maria Luisa]] [[1816]]-[[1847]] is remembered as one of the best ever seen in Piacenza; the duchess drained many lands, built several bridges across the [[Trebbia]] river and the [[Nure]] stream, and created educational and artistic activities.

===Union with Italy===
[[Austria]]n and [[Croatia]]n milices occupied Piacenza until, in [[1848]], a plebiscite marked the entrance of the city in the [[Risorgimento|Kingdom of Sardinia]]. 37,089 voters out of 37,585 voted for the annexation. Piacenza was therefore declared ''Primogenita dell'Unità di Italia'' ("First-born of Unification of Italy") by the monarch. The Piacentini enrolled in mass in the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s army which went in southern Italy to fight for independence.

In the June of [[1865]] the first railway bridge was inaugurated. In [[1891]] the first Chamber of Workers was created in Piacenza.

During [[World War II]] the city was heavily bombed by the [[Allies]]. The important railway bridge across the Po River, the railway station, as well as the historical centre, were destroyed. On the hills and the [[Appenine]] mountains, [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] bands were active. On the end of April,25 1945 a General partisan insurrection by the Italian resistance movement burnst and on 29 arrived at the city  troops of [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] . In [[1996]] president [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]] honoured Piacenza with the Gold Medal for Valour in Battle.

===Palaces===
*'' Palazzo Comunale'', also known as il Gotico, was built in 1281 as the seat of the government of the town. It is one of the best preserved examples of Medieval civic building in northern Italy and is built by the model of "Broletto", typical of nearby Lombardy. Of the original design, only the northern side was completed, with its typical Guelph merlons, the arcaded frame, the central bell tower with two lesser ones at the sides. The façade, with five arcades, is in pink marble in the lower part and in [[brickwork]] (decorated with geometrical figures) in the upper part. A rose window overlooks the short side, which has three arcades. The main hall has frescoes, and is used for meetings, lectures and conferences.
* ''[[Palazzo Farnese (Piacenza)|Palazzo Farnese]]'', begun in [[1568]] by Ottavio Farnese and his wife, [[Margaret of Austria (1522-1583)|Margaret of Austria]]. The initial project was devised by Francesco Paciotto, from [[Urbino]], and works were entrusted to Giovanni Bernardo Della Valle, Giovanni Lavezzari and Bernardo Panizzari (Caramosino). The design was modified in [[1568]] by [[Jacopo Barozzi]], better known as Vignola.
*''Palazzo Landi'', built in the Middle Ages but renovated in the late 15th century.
*''Palazzo Costa''.
*''Palazzo Somaglia''.
*''Palazzo Scotti'', housing the Museum of Natural History.
*''Palazzo dei Mercanti'' (17th century), the current Town Hall.

===Other places of interest===
* ''Piazza Cavalli'' is the main square of the town. It is named ("Cavalli" means "horses") for the two bronze equestrian monuments of [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alessandro Farnese]] (Duke of Parma and Piacenza from 1586, nephew and valiant general of [[Philip II of Spain]]) and his son [[Ranuccio I, Duke of Parma and Piacenza|Ranuccio]], who succeeded him to the dukedom. The statues are masterpieces of [[Francesco Mochi]], a Mannerist sculptor.
* The ''[[Duomo di Piacenza]]'' is the Catholic cathedral of the diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio. It was built from 1122 to 1233 and is one of the most valuable examples of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedral in northern Italy. The façade, in [[Verona|Veronese]] pink marble and gilted stone, is horizontally parted by a gallery that dominates the three gates, decorated with capitals and Romanic statues. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by 25 large pillars. It has noteworthy frescoes, made in the 14th-16th centuries by [[Camillo Procaccini]] and [[Ludovico Carracci]], while those of the dome are by [[Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli|Morazzone]] and [[Guercino]]. The presbytery as a wooden sculpture from 1479, a wodden choir by Giangiacomo da Genova (1471) and statues of Lombard school from the 15th century. The crypt, on the Greek cross plan, has 108 Romanesque small columns and is home to the relics of Saint Justine, to which the first cathedral (crumbled down in 1117 after an earthquake) was dedicated.
*The church of St. Francis, in Piazza Cavalli, is a 12th century Romanesque/Gothic edifice which, thanks to its central position, assumed the role of civic Sanctuary in the Middle Ages. Part of the ancient cloisters remains. The main gate is enriched by a big lunette of the 15th century representing the ''Ecstasy of St. Francis''. The interior, with nave and two aisles divided by low and strong brick pillars that support high gothic arches, has a Latin Cross scheme. The nave, higher than the aisles, has a pentahedric apse in which the aisle apses meet; decorations include 15th-16th centuries frescoes. In the church was proclaimed the annexion of Piacenza to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in [[1848]].
*The basilica of ''Sant'Antonino'' is an example of Romanesque architecture, characterized by a large octagonal tower. It was commissioned by St. Victor, first bihsop of the city, in 350 CE, and completed in 375. It contains the relics of the eponymous saint, martyrized near [[Travo]], in the [[Trebbia|Val Trebbia]]. In 1183 the delegates of Frederick Barbarossa and of the Lombard League met here for the premilimaries of [[peace of Constance]]. The church was renovated after damage cretaed by the barbarian invasion, and has a 15th century cloister. In the interior, the main artworks are the frescoes by [[Camillo Gervasetti]] (1622).
*The basilica of ''San Savino'', dedicated to St. Victor's successor, was begun in [[903]] but consecrated only in 1107. The façade and the portico are from the 17th-18th centuries. The presbytery and the crypts contain 12th century polychrome mosaics. The interior is in Lombard-Gothic style, with anthropomorphic capitals of the columns. Over the high altar is a 12th century wooden crucifix by an unknown artist.
*''San Giovanni in Canale'' was founded by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s in [[1220]], and enlarged in the mid-16th century. 
*''Santa Maria in Campagna'', a Renaissance church, faces Piazzale delle Crociate ("Crusades Square"), so called because [[Pope Urban II]] summoned the First Crusade here in 1095. The church was built in [[1522]]-[[1528]] to house a miraculous wooden sculpture of the Madonna. The interior was originally on the Greek cross plan, but was later turned into a Latin cross one. [[Il Pordenone]] finished fine frescoes in the dome and in two chapels on the left side.
*St. Sixtus is a Renaissance church with a precious choir, designed by [[Alessio Tramello]]. It was begun in the 15th century over a temple edificated in 874 by Empress Angilberga. Also by Tramello is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
* The most famous relic of the region's pre-Roman civilization is the Bronze [[Liver of Piacenza]], an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] bronze model of a sheep's liver dating from the end of the second century to the beginning of the first century BCE.  It was discovered in [[1877]] in Ciavernasco di Settima, near [[Gossolengo]], near Piacenza, and is housed in Piacenza's Archaeological Museum, part of the Musei Civici di Palazzo Farnese.  Containing writing on its surface delineating the various parts of the liver and their significance, it was likely used as an educational tool for students studying [[haruspex|haruspicy]], or [[divination]].
* Ricci Oddi Gallery is an art-gallery dedicated to modern Italian painters.

==Dialect==
Many inhabitants of Piacenza and the surrounding province still use the Piacentine (or Piacentino) [[dialects of Italy|dialect]], which is quite different from standard (Florentine) [[Italian language|Italian]] as it is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[Emiliano-Romagnolo]] minority language. The different grammar rules and the dissimilar pronunciation of even similar words make it largely mutually unintelligible with standard Italian, with many regular vowels being replaced with [[I-mutation|umlaut]]s or eliminated altogether.  Although there have been a number of notable poets and writers using the Piacentine, it has experienced a steady decline during the 20th century due to the growing standardization of the Italian language in the national educational system.

==Cuisine==

Piacenza and its province are renowned for the production of seasoned and salted pork products. The main specialities are ''[[pancetta]]'' (rolled seasoned pork belly, salted and spiced), ''[[Coppa (food)|coppa]]'' (seasoned pork neck, containing less fat than ''pancetta'', matured at least for six months) and ''[[Salami|salame]]'' (chopped pork meat flavoured with spices and wine, and made into [[sausage]]s).

''Bortellina'' (salted pancakes made with flour, salt, and water or milk) and ''chisulén'' (''torta fritta'' in Standard Italian; made with flour, milk, and animal fats mixed together and then fried in hot ''strutto'', or clarified pork fat) are the perfect coupling of ''pancetta'', ''coppa'', and ''salame'', but they are also good with fat cheese<!--What does "fat cheese" mean?-->, particularly [[Gorgonzola cheese]] and [[Robiola]].

''Pisarei e fasö'' is an exquisite mixture of handmade [[pasta]] and beans.<!--Which kind of beans? Cannellini?-->

Among the culinary specialties of the Piacenza region (although also enjoyed in nearby [[Cremona]]) is ''[[Mostarda|mostarda di frutta]]'', consisting of preserved fruits in a sugary syrup strongly flavored with mustard. ''Turtlìt'' (''tortelli dolci'' in standard Italian), or fruit dumplings, are filled with ''mostarda di frutta'', mashed [[chestnut]]s, and other ingredients, and are served at Easter. ''Turtlìt'' are also popular in the [[Ferrara]] area. ''Turtéi'', a similarly named Piacentine specialty, is a kind of pasta filled with [[ricotta]] cheese.

Piacentine staple foods include corn (generally cooked as [[polenta]]) and rice (usually cooked as [[risotto]]), both of which are very common across northern Italy. Pasta is also eaten, though it is not as popular as in southern Italy. There are also locally produced cheeses, such as [[Grana Padano]], though nearby [[Parma]] is more famous for its dairy products.

The hills surrounding Piacenza are well known for their vineyards. The wine produced in this area is qualified with a D.o.c. ([[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|Denominazione di origine controllata]]) called "[[Colli piacentini]]" ("Hills of Piacenza"). Main wines are [[Gutturnio]] (red wine, both sparkilng or still), [[Bonarda]] (a red wine, often sparkling and foamy, made from [[Croatina]] grapes), [[Ortrugo]] (a dry white wine), and [[Malvasia]] (a sweet white wine).
