The '''Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad''' ('''C&TS''') is a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[heritage railway|heritage railroad]] running between [[Chama, New Mexico]] and [[Antonito, Colorado]]. The track was originally laid in 1880 by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver and Rio Grande Railroad]]. Starting in 1970, the railroad began to take tourists on six-hour trips between the two towns, using [[steam locomotive]]s. 

==Historic and railfan interest==
Chama today is a small village, but considered hallowed ground by many [[railfan]]s. Chama houses one of the most physically complete railroad yards in the country. Though portions of the [[roundhouse]], warehouses, and parking lots have been changed, the railroad yard still has the feel of 1960 and earlier. The Yard Tracks contain authentic rolling stock of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver and Rio Grande Western]] indigenous to the railroad line. 

Even the [[locomotives]] of the railroad were built for the C&TS's precursor, all [[2-8-2]] Mikados. From the rare K-27 "Mudhen", #463, once owned by [[Gene Autry]], to the homebuilt K-37's built by the D&RGW in 1929-30 in the railroad's Burnham Shops.  The mainstay of the fleet, is the venerable K-36 fleet, turned out by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in August of 1925. The arguable "flagship" of the line is K-36, #487, which has seen the most service in the operation of the railroad.

==Operational information==
The C&TS Railroad is comprised of {{convert|64|mi|km}} of former [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver and Rio Grande Western]] trackage. While officially headquartered in Chama, New Mexico, the railroad splits most of its functions between the termini of the railroad. At its Antonito end, the Cumbres and Toltec Commission offices are headquartered, along with the railroad's main car shop, where repairs to rolling stock are performed. The main center of actual operation for the railroad is located in Chama, where the locomotive repair shop is located.

===Schedule===
The 2008 Schedule calls for trains operating 7 days per week, from Sunday, May 24th through Sunday, October 19th.  Each day trains will depart both Chama and Antonito, with trains meeting at Osier before returning back to either Chama or Antonito.  This will allow either a one-way trip across the entire line (with charter bus return) or a round trip to Osier and back.  The railroad will also operate a Chama-Cumbres round trip, called the Sunday Express on Sundays between July 6th and August 24th.  Finally, on Thursdays between June 12th and August 14th, the railroad will operate a Chama-Cumbres round trip called the Cinder Bear Express that is geared towards children.

==Trip description==
===Eastward to Osier===
[[Image:487 at water.jpg|thumb|left|C&TS #487 in the Chama Yard]]
Beginning in Chama (Milepost 344.12), the railroad makes a nearly straight shot in a northeasterly direction out of Chama after leaving the yard, and crossing the [[Rio Chama]]. Over a mile and a half later, the 4% grade begins, from here to Cumbres, the grade is nearly constant, with one major exception at Coxo. The first siding on the line is located at Lobato (MP: 399.99), located here are the remnants of a [[stock pen]], and a [[water tank]] specifically made for a movie in the 1970s, though the tank would also be used in ''Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.'' As of 2006, the water tower was knocked over, due to age and high winds. Just under a quarter of a mile away, is Lobato Trestle, this [[trestle]] is the second highest trestle on the line, and was erected in 1883. Due to weight restrictions, only one locomotive at a time is allowed to cross the bridge at a single time: therefore, all double-headers on the line must separate, and rejoin upon reaching the other side.

From here to Cumbres, the railroad operates on the north side of [[Wolf Creek Pass|Wolf Creek]]. On the journey to the top at Cumbres, the train passes Cresco Siding and water tank (MP 335.10) and navigates a small canyon past Hamilton's Point. Exiting the canyon, the tracks make a turn to the northwest and up the Wolf Creek drainage through Coxo.  At a narrow point of the valley, the tracks make a horseshoe turn up to Windy Point, which the train rounds to enter [[Cumbres Pass]].

Located at Cumbres (MP 330.48), elevation {{convert|10015|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, is the Car Inspector's House, Water Standpipe, remnant of the extensive [[snow shed]], and the Section House, which has replaced the original depot after it was demolished in the 1950s. From here eastward, the tracks head downward at a lesser grade, the ruling grade now is 2.5%, and descends the Cumbres Loop, more commonly refer to as "Tanglefoot Curve". After exiting the loop, the tracks follow a general westerly direction until Milepost 327.6, where the tracks turn northwards up the [[Los Pinos Valley]].  

Heading northward, the tracks lose elevation, while the valley slopes upward, with the tracks and valley floor finally meeting at Mile 325, where the tracks once again change direction, heading southward now, begin to follow the [[Rio de Los Pinos]] towards Osier. After Mile 323, the tracks again leave the valley, on a much steeper grade, while the tracks cling to the valley created by the river. Along the way, the route will traverse Cascade Trestle (MP 319.95), taller than the Loboto Trestle, at {{convert|137|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high, the Cascade Trestle is the highest on the line, and is built in the same construction as Lobato. Approximately  a mile and a half later, the tracks enter [[Osier, Colorado]], the mid-point of the railroad where the two trains meet for lunch. Here, riders may return to their point of origin, or switch trains and ride to the opposing terminus.

===Westward To Osier===
This section covers the eastern portion of the line from the small cattle town of Antonito to Osier, the midpoint of the line.  
Antonito (MP 280.70) is a small company town of the former Denver and Rio Grande Railway, now Union Pacific. Here, the car shop, balloon loop, water tank, and other relics of the C&TS reside. The water tank was brought in from Lava (MP 291.55) after the original water tank at Antonito burned in 1971. For a time firetrucks had to refuel the K-27, 36, and 37 locomotives that provide the motive power for the train. Most of the facilities were made by the Cumbres & Toltec, as the original rail yard, wye, and station were not sold to the states of Colorado and New Mexico.
  
Shortly leaving the station, the train heads straight for {{convert|3|mi|km}}, until coming into some hills. Shortly afterwards, the train crosses Ferguson's Trestle (MP 285.87), made famous when a man by the same name was hung from a locomotive on the bridge. It was featured in the 1988 TV movie ''Where the Hell's That Gold?!!?'' starring [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Delta Burke]]. The bridge burned and traffic was halted for a week while the C&TS rebuilt the trestle. About three miles (5 km) later, the train makes its first of 11 crossings into New Mexico, and climbs a ledge up to a lava mesa. Lava (291.55) makes a sharp turn, and the old tank from Antonito resides here. This is a reverse loop, used to turn the Rotary Snow Plow trains from Chama.

The Cumbres and Toltec has two of the old Rotary Snow Plows, Rotary OM and Rotary OY.  Rotary ON is in a scrap heap next to the rails of the White Pass & Yukon Route Railroad, while other Rio Grade rolling stock also reside there. Heading west, the train traverses Whiplash Curve.  About a mile from Whiplash Curve lies the sidings and wye facilities of Big Horn.  Past Big Horn the train loops around the sides of mountains going through horseshoe curves before reaching the 1st [[water stop]] at Sublette.

Sublette is an abandoned section camp on the railroad, consisting of a log bunk house, a section house, a siding, and other buildings.  There used to be a water tank at the western end of the siding, and today in its place is a stand pipe.  After filling its tender with water, the engine and the train slowly creep into the lush aspen groves.

After departing Sublette, you pass by Toltec Siding, which in the 50's was the meeting place of long pipe and oil trains moving between Chama and Farmington to Alamosa.  Shortly afterwords, you pass through Mud Tunnel. One interesting feature is the tunnel is lined with wooden pillars since it is made through soft volcanic ash.  When the beams in the tunnel collapsed, the D&RGW made a "shoo fly" around the tunnel to allow passengers and small cars to be moved around the tunnel to an awaiting train.  After passing through this, you go around Phantom Curve and through the Calico Cut, and then the train starts to slow.  You are not slowing due to a station, but for some of the best scenery on the trip. 

The whistle then blows for another tunnel, Rock Tunnel.  This curved tunnel leads you through Toltec Gorge, in which the train passes {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the river floor.  After exiting the tunnel, the rocky ledges surround you.  You slowly creep out of it and past the monument to President Garfield.  Your train picks up speed again but not for long, as you are only around 10 minutes from lunch at Osier.  You finally reach there, and stop and let off your passengers before the Chama Train arrives around 15 minutes later.
