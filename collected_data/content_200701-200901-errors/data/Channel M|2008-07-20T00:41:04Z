'''Channel M''' is a television station which is based in [[Manchester]]. Originally named '''Manchester Student Television''', the channel's output is specifically designed for [[Greater Manchester]]. It began broadcasting on 14 February 2000.

Originally, the main sources of programming were [[CHUM Limited|CHUM]], [[Euronews]], Channel M's own productions and the [[University of Salford]]. However, since the station was launched on digital satellite services in April 2006, Channel M has invested and developed of a raft of in-house programming, focusing on news, music, lifestyle and sport. 

Channel M is owned and operated by the [[Guardian Media Group]], which in addition to its national newspapers, remains a major player in local media in Manchester, owning [[The Manchester Evening News]], several local newspapers and the '''Smooth''' and '''Century''' radio stations serving the North West of England.

==Coverage==
As an [[Restricted Service Licence|RSL]] station Channel M was primarily available [[free to air]] on terrestrial in parts of Greater Manchester. In 2004 Channel M launched on the [[NTL]] platform (now part of [[Virgin Media]]), but the highest increase in viewership was when the channel launched on the [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky Digital]] Satellite platform in April 2006. When the channel launched on Sky it was the first [[Restricted Service Licence|RSL]] channel to be broadcast on satellite. This gave the station UK-wide coverage on the BSkyB service, as well as availability to broadcast across Western Europe on Astra 28.2 degrees East. 

The channel can be received on analogue television, on channel 39 (615 MHz) in some western and southern areas of the service area, on [[Virgin Media]] Channel 878 around [[Greater Manchester]], [[Lancashire|Mid-Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]] and nationwide on [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky]] channel 203. The service is not available on [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]].

The channel also become the first broadcaster in the region to offer its programmes on demand via broadband TV on its award-winning website. [http://www.channelm.co.uk]

==Channel M News==
The flagship output of Channel M is its regional news service which covers stories from the ten boroughs of Greater Manchester. The bulletins are produced at the station's studios located in the [[Urbis]] museum in [[Manchester City Centre]]. Inclusive of the Breakfast programme, Channel M News produces 28 hours of programming per week - more than any other local or regional TV news service in the United Kingdom.

''Channel M News Live'' is broadcast between 1700 and 1900, presented by [[Andy Crane]] and Jess Dunsdon. Before the two-hour service began on 17th September 2007, a half-hour programme was broadcast live at 1700 and repeated half-hourly until 1900 usually with Crane as the sole anchor. [[Clare Fallon]] and [[Manchester Evening News|MEN]] columnist Byron Evans also featured regularly as Channel M News anchors before joining ''Channel M Breakfast'' as presenters.

''Channel M News at Nine'' is broadcast live between 2100-2130 and repeated again at 2130-2200. The programme was launched in summer 2006 and was originally broadcast from 2100-2200, since 17th September 2007 this programme was shortened to half of its original length but repeated at 2130. Alongside Andy Crane, this programme was anchored by [[BBC Radio Manchester]] presenter Heather Stott until she returned to [[BBC North West Tonight]] to present the weather. 

''Channel M Breakfast'' broadcasts from 0600-0900 every morning. Bryon Evans, Nikki Dean & Nina Warhurst are the programme's anchors and joined by special guests, entertainment and sport editors throughout the morning. The news headlines are usually read by Clare Fallon (also a News programme editor) and the traffic, travel and weather updates are usually read by Michelle Totton (also known as "Totty"). When the show began on Monday 16th April 2007, it replaced a [[Euronews]] simulcast, which broadcast on Channel M in the same timeslot. Euronews now broadcasts on Channel M from 0300-0600.

''Channel M News Review'' is also produced by the news team. The programme consists of a half-hour overview of the week's news from Greater Manchester and features replays of reports featured in the main weekday buletins. The pre-recorded programme is usually presented by main anchor Andy Crane. Currently, no live news programmes are produced on Saturday or Sunday.

On 10th April 2008, ''Channel M News'' produced its first live outside broadcast, from the funeral of [[Greater Manchester Police|GMP]] chief constable, [[Michael J. Todd|Michael Todd]].

Until [[August 2005]], the news service was broadcast from [[The Printworks]] entertainment complex. Due to a week-long exhibition at the [[Urbis]] building in January 2007, Channel M News was broadcast from the newsroom of the [[Guardian Media Group]]'s Headquarters in [[Spinningfields]], Manchester, where part of Channel M's newsgathering operations shares office space with the [[Manchester Evening News]].

==Regional Programming==
The channel's biggest audiences are for its news bulletins and sports programmes. It is also renowned for its entertainment output including the comedy talk-show ''Frank Sidebottom's Proper Telly Show'' and music coverage. Programming such as the thrice-weekly entertainment show ''City Centre Social'' and video/computer game review series ''[[Re:Loaded]]'' has helped Channel M to gain interest nationally.

Sport programming such as ''Code XIII'', ''Talking Sharks'', ''FC United - The Fans' Club'', ''The Phoenix Ice Hockey Show'', ''Seconds Out'' and ''Inside MCFC'' broadcast news, highlights and features from Greater Manchester's sporting teams.

Entertainment programming is broadcast at the 8pm slot and throughout the daytime schedule. These programmes often feature celebrity interviews, music, culture, food and fashion news from around Manchester. ''Cookin' Impossible'' is a tongue-in-cheek cookery series in which Channel M presenter Gerry McLaughlin is set a culinary task and has to fulfil it. ''Style In The City'' is presented by Jemma Gofton and features the latest trends, hidden fahsion boutiques and fashion events in and around Manchester. Other programmes include ''Fashion Face Off'' (a style-themed game show) and ''City Life'' (a weekly magazine show, first broadcast on Friday nights).

''The Great Northern Music Show'', ''City Centre Social'' and ''Saturday Social'' are Channel M's main music programmes, often presented by Gerry McLaughlin. These programmes usually show live or ''unplugged'' sets from [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Indie (music)|indie]] bands. At 4pm and intervals throughout the day ''Channel M Playlist'' and ''Made in Manchester'' are broadcast, which airs music videos, usually from the [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Indie (music)|indie]] genres. Originally, [[CHUM Television]]'s North American music output was shown during the day.

Travel-style magazine ''I Love Manchester'' is a half-hour feature series, showcasing an area of the Greater Manchester region in each episode. The programme explores entertainment, fashion, food and history of parts of the area. The programme has run for three series and is presented by former Breakfast anchor Steph Elmore.

In terms of broadcast awards, [[University of Salford]] productions ''Hitting Home'' and ''Reel North'' have received multiple nominations from the [http://www.rts.org.uk Royal Television Society] since 2001, respectively winning Best Regional Current Affairs Programme in 2005 and Best Regional Programme in 2006.

==Advertising==
Channel M's extremely localised audience is unusual for a British television channel. This has promoted an opportunity for local advertising on a Greater Manchester-wide scale. 

The majority of the commercials shown on Channel M are produced by local companies attempting to attract this localised audience. One can recognise that many of these commercials are extremely low budget. Large companies like [[Ikea]] and [[dfs (retailer)|DFS]] have also advertised on Channel M, the former during the opening of Greater Manchester's first Ikea store in [[Ashton-Under-Lyne]]. Many of these adverts are also shown on [[ITV1]] in the [[Granada Television]] Region. Channel M offers businesses an opportunity to create a television advertisement, as the channel also films, edits and produces commercials.

==The Future==
Channel M's former dependence on imported programmes (mainly music and entertainment programming from Canadian [[CHUM Limited|CHUM]]) was down to the amount of original output created by Channel M with Canadian programming previously making up much of the station's schedule. With the increase of in-house production since its launch on Sky Digital, Channel M now broadcasts up to 21 hours a day of local programming. The [[Euronews]] breakfast slot was moved back to early morning due to the creation of '''Channel M Breakfast''', resulting in a full 24-hour service. 

Former [[BBC Radio Manchester]] host, [[Granada Television|Granada]] presenter and Factory Records boss [[Anthony Wilson]] was due to present a new Friday evening music and entertainment show called ''The New Friday'', produced by former Granada producer and [[BBC Radio Manchester]] host Eamonn O'Neill. However, this programme was postponed after Wilson became terminally ill with cancer. Wilson died on Friday 10th August 2007 and the plans for '' The New Friday'' were soon abandoned. Since then, ''City Centre Social'' was moved from Mondays-Wednesdays to Wednesdays-Fridays, together with a shift to more live music programming on Channel M.

==Manchester Media==
[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]], which is based at offices in the Spinningfields district of Manchester, owns and operates Channel M. Over the past two years, the company has invested greatly in publicising Channel M in a billboard, taxi wrap-around, adshel and newspaper campaign. Channel M's news reporters liaise with journalists at GMG's The [[Manchester Evening News]], MEN Media's local weekly newspapers and GMG's Greater Manchester-based radio stations [[Smooth Radio]] and [[Century FM]]. This access is advantageous to the station - it means that cross-reference advertising can be done for free and that newsgathering operations can be shared. An example of this cross referencing is that on the cover of the [[Manchester Evening News|MEN]] every day where a reference is made to a news feature or programme on Channel M that evening.

Other broadcasting headquarters in Manchester include [[ITV]] franchisee [[Granada Television]] which is located on Quay Street and [[BBC]]'s Northern England hub on [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] where [[BBC North West|North West Tonight]] and [[BBC Radio Manchester]] are based.
