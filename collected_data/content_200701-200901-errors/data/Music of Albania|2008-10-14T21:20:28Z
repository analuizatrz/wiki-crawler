[[Albania]] is a [[Southeast Europe]]an nation that was ruled by [[Enver Hoxha]]'s [[communism|communist]] government for much of the later part of the 20th century; it is now a democratic country. Even before Hoxha's reign began, Albania was long controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and other conquering powers, leading to a diversity of influences that is common in the much-fragmented Balkan region and resulting in a diverse and unique musical sound. Albanians (and the ethnic-Albanian [[Kosovo|Kosovars]] of [[Kosovo]]) are commonly divided into three groupings: the northern [[Gheg]]s and southern [[Lab (Albania)|Labs]] and [[Tosk]]s.  [[Turkey|Turkish]] influence is strongest around the capital city, [[Tirana]], while [[Shkodër]] has been long considered the center for musical development in Albania.

Folk music was encouraged to some degree under the socialist government, which promoted a quinquennial music festival at [[Gjirokastër]] provided that the musicians expressed frequent support for the party leaders. After the fall of socialism, [[RTSH|Albanian Radio-Television]] launched a 1995 festival in [[Berat]] that has helped to continue musical traditions.<ref name="roughguide">Burton, Kim.

== Characteristics ==

Albania's political, military and cultural domination by outside elements have contributed to the country's modern music scene. Albanian music is a fusion of the musics of Southeastern Europe, especially that of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled Albania for more than 500 years. However, the Albanian people kept themselves culturally apart from the Ottomans, with many living in rural and remote mountains. The Ottoman were Turkish people.

==Folk music==
[[Image:A traditional male folk group from Skrapar.JPG|thumb|250px|A traditional male folk group from Skrapar]]
Albanian folk music falls into three sylistic groups, with other important [[music area]]s around [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]]; the major groupings are the [[Gheg]]s of the north and southern Labs and [[Tosk]]s. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the "rugged and heroic" tone of the north and the "relaxed, gentle and exceptionally beautiful" form of the south. These disparate styles are unified by "the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of [[oral history]]",<ref name="roughguide"/> as well as certain characteristics like the use of obscure rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.<ref>Arbatsky, Yuri, cited in Koco with the footnote ''Translated and published by Filip Fishta in Shkolla Kombëtare (The National School; No.1, May 1939), 19, and quoted from his Preface to [[Pjetër Dungu]]'s Lyra Shqiptare (see note 2).''</ref> The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by [[Pjetër Dungu]] in 1940.

Albanian folk songs can be divided into major groups, the heroic epics of the north, and the sweetly melodic [[lullaby|lullabies]], love songs, [[wedding music]], [[work song]]s and other kinds of song. The music of various festivals and holidays is also an important part of Albanian folk song, especially those that celebrate St. Lazarus Day (''the llazore''), which inauguarates the springtime. Lullabies and [[lament]]s are very important kinds of Albanian folk song, and are generally performed by solo women.<ref name="koco">{{cite web|title=Albanian Music|work=Eno Koco at the University of Leeds|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/ek/|accessmonthday=August 28 |accessyear=2005}}</ref>

===Northern Albania===

The Ghegs from north of the [[Shkumbini River]] are known for a distinctive variety of sung epic poetry. Many of these are about [[Skanderbeg]], a legendary 15th century warrior who led the struggle against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]s, and the "constant Albanian themes of honour, hospitality, treachery and revenge". These traditions are a form of oral history for the Ghegs, and also "preserve and inculcate moral codes and social values", necessary in a society that, until the early 20th century, relied on blood feuds as its "primary means of law enforcement".<ref>Burton, pg. 2 <small>''Both epic traditions serve as a medium for oral history in what was until quite recently, a pre-literate society... and also preserve and inculcate moral codes and social values. In a culture that retained the blood-feud as its primary means of law enforcement until well into this century such codes were literally matters of life and death. Song was one of the most efficient ways of making sure that each member of the tribe was aware of what obligations he or she was bound by.</small>''</ref> Styles of epics include ''këngë trimash'' (''songs of bravery''), ''këngë kreshnikësh'', [[ballad]]s and ''maje krahi'' (''cries''){{Fact|date=February 2007}}<!--There used to be a note there, but there was no associated footnotes.-->. Major epics include ''Mujo and Halil'' and ''Halil and Hajrije''.<ref name="koco"/>

The most traditional variety of epic poetry is called ''Rapsodi Kreshnike'' (''Poems of Heroes''). These epic poems are sung, accompanied by a ''lahuta'', a one-stringed [[fiddle]]. It is rarely performed in modern Albania, but is found in the northern highlands.<ref name="roughguide"/>

Somewhat further south, around [[Dibër]] and [[Kërçovë]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], the lahuta is not used, replaced by the [[çifteli]], a two-stringed instrument in which one string is used for the [[Drone (music)|drone]] and one for the [[melody]]. Though men are the traditional performers, except for the Vajze të betuar, women have increasingly been taking part in epic balladry.<ref name="roughguide"/>

Along with the [[def]], çifteli and sharki are used in a style of dance and pastoral songs. Homemade [[wind instrument]]s are traditionally used by [[shepherd]]s in northern Albania; these include the zumarë, an unusual kind of clarinet. This shepherds' music is "melancholic and contemplative" in tone.<ref name="roughguide"/> The songs called ''maje-krahi'' are another important part of North Albanian folk song; these were originally used by mountaineers to communicate over wide distances, but are now seen as songs.  ''Maje-krahi'' songs require the full range of the voice and are full of "melismatic nuances and falsetto cries".<ref name="koco"/>

===Southern Albania=== <!-- This section is linked from [[Pentatonic scale]] -->

Southern Albanian music is soft and gentle, and polyphonic in nature.  [[Vlorë]] in the southwest has perhaps the most unusual vocal traditions in the area, with four distinct parts (''taker'', ''thrower'', ''turner'' and ''drone'') that combine to create a complex and emotionally cathartic melody. Author Kim Burton has described the melodies as "decorated with [[falsetto]] and [[vibrato]], sometimes interrupted by wild and mournful cries". This polyphonic vocal music is full of power that "stems from the tension between the immense emotional weight it carries, rooted in centuries of pride, poverty and oppression, and the strictly formal, almost ritualistic nature of its structure".<ref name="roughguide"/>

South Albania is also known for funeral laments with a chorus and one to two soloists with overlapping, mournful voices. There is a prominent folk love song tradition in the south, in which performers use free rhythm and consonant harmonies, elaborated with [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]] and [[melisma]].<ref name="koco"/>

The Tosk people are known for ensembles consisting of [[violin]]s, [[clarinet]]s, llautë (a kind of [[lute]]) and [[def]].  [[Eli Fara]], a popular émigré performer, is from [[Korçë]], but the city of [[Përmet]] is the center for southern musical innovation, producing artists like Remzi Lela and Laver Bariu. Lela is of special note, having founded a musical dynasty that continues with his descendants playing a part in most of the major music institutions in Tirana.<ref name="roughguide"/>

Southern instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven form driven by a clarinet or violin alongside accordions and llautës. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as "both fresh and ancient", "ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality", exemplifying the "combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture."<ref name="roughguide"/>

The ethnic [[Greece|Greek]] inhabitants of Dropulli, have a music very similar to the [[pentatonic]] [[music of Epirus]] in Greece. These Greek-Albanians have a rougher and more aggressive sound than other forms of Albanian music, and lack the polyphonic complexity, but otherwise the same scales and rhythmic patterns as the rest of the country.<ref name="roughguide"/>

==Popular music==

The city of Korca has long been the cultural capital of Albania, and its music is considered the most sophisticated in the country.  [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]n [[sevdalinka]] is an important influence on music from the area, which is complex, with shifts through major and minor scales with a Turkish sound and a romantic and sophisticated tone.<ref name="roughguide"/> Traditional musicians from Shkodër include Bujar Qamili, Luçija Miloti, Xhevdet Hafizi and Bik Ndoja. [[Albanians]] also play the [[Duduk|Armenian Duduk]].

Albania's capital, Tirana, is the home of popular music dominated by [[Roma people|Romani]] influences and has been popularized at home and in emigrant communities internationally by Merita Halili, Parashqevi Simaku and Myslim Leli.<ref name="roughguide"/> In recent times, influences from [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] have led to the creation of bands that play [[rock and roll|rock]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] among many other genres.

The best voices of contemporary Albanian music are those of Vace Zela and Nexhmije Pagarusha. The first one had a successful career in Tirana and the second one in Prishtina. Its only fair to admit that their success was never recognised internationally, but that does not take away anything from their greatness. The Albanian music has never had the chance to get a worldwide publicity such as the one that would come from a successful movie or other event of international interest. It is really like an unexplored treasure of antiquity, that is waiting to be discovered.

===1930s art song===

The urban art songs of 1930s Albania can be traced back to the 19th century folk music of Albanian cities. These songs are a major part of Albania's music heritage, but have been little-studied by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]], who prefer to focus on the rural folk music that they see as being more authentically Albanian. Urban art songs are strongly influenced by the music of the Ottoman authorities who controlled Albania for a very long time, introducing elements of [[music of Turkey|Turkish music]], especially the Ottoman modal scales, to local folk styles. The northern part of Albania took more readily to Turkish music because both traditions use [[monophony]], while the south of Albania has long been based on [[polyphony]] and a Greek modal system.<ref name="koco"/>

Out of this [[melting pot]] of local and imported styles came a kind of lyrical art song based in the cities of [[Shkodra]], [[Elbasan]], [[Berat]] and [[Korça]]. Though similar traditions existed in other places, they were little recorded and remain largely unknown. By the end of the 19th century, Albanian [[nationalism]] was inspiring many to attempt to remove the elements of Turkish music from Albanian culture, a desire that was intensified following independence in 1912; bands that formed during this era played a variety of European styles, including [[march (music)|march]]es and [[waltz]]es. Urban song in the early 20th century could be divided into two styles: the historic or nationalistic style, and the lyrical style.<ref name="koco"/> The lyrical style included a wide array of lullabies and other forms, as well as love songs.

By the end of the 1930s, urban art song had been incorporated into classical music, while the singer Marie Kraja made a popular career out of art songs; she was one of Albania's first popular singers. The first recordings, however, of urban art song came as early as [[1937]], with the orchestral sounds of Tefta Tashko-Koço.<ref name="koco"/>

===1950s and beyond===

Modern Albanian popular music uses instruments like the [[çifteli]] and [[sharki]], which have been used in large bands since the [[Second World War]] to great popular acclaim; the same songs, accompanied by [[clarinet]] and [[accordion]], are performed at small weddings and celebrations.<ref name="roughguide"/>  

===Albanian music in Macedonia and Kosovo===
''Main articles: [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia]], [[Music of Kosovo]]''

[[Kosovo]] has been home to many important Albanian musicians and the same can be said for Macedonia. Prior to the [[Kosovo War]], there was a thriving music industry in Kosovo, which reached new heights in recent years. The Kosovar music industry was home to many famous musicians, including the famous [[Nexhmije Pagarusha]], [[Ismet Peja]] and the romantic, more elaborate Qamil i Vogël of [[Djakovica]].<ref name="roughguide"/> The Macedonian band Vëllezërit Aliu became well- known for the traditional vocal duets accompanied by drum box, electric bass, synthesizer and clarinet or saxophone.<ref name="roughguide"/>

==Classical music==

One pivotal composer in modern Albanian classical music was Mart Gjoka, who composed several vocal and instrumental music which uses elements of urban art song and the folk melodies of the northern highlands; Gjoka's work in the early 1920s marks the beginning of professional Albanian classical music.<ref name="frosina">{{cite web|work=Frosina Information Network|title=The Tradition of Classical Music In Albania|url=http://www.frosina.org/about/infobits.asp?id=136|accessmonthday=August 28 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> Later, the Albanian-American émigrés [[Fan S. Noli]] and Murat Shendu achieved some renown, with Noli using urban folk songs in his ''Byzantine Overture'' and is also known for a symphonic poem called ''Scanderberg''.<ref name="koco"/> Shehu spent much of his life in prison for his religious beliefs, but managed to compose [[melodrama]]s like ''The Siege of Shkodër'', ''The Red Scarf'' and ''Rozafa'', which helped launch the field of Albanian opera{{Fact|date=February 2007}}<!--previous note didn't have associated footnote-->. Other famous art composers include Thoma Nassi, Kristo Kono and Frano Ndoja.  [[Preng Jakova]] became well-known for operas like ''Scanderbeg'' and ''Mrika'', which were influenced by traditional [[Italian opera]], the [[belcanto]] style and Albanian folk song. Undoubtedly the most famous Albanian composer, however, was [[Çesk Zadeja]], known as the Father of Albanian classical music;<ref name="frosina"/> he composed in many styles, from symphonies to ballets, beginning in 1956, and also helped found the Music Conservatory of Tirana, the Theatre of Opera and Ballet, and the Assembly of Songs and Dances.

Later in the 20th century, Albanian composers came to focus on ballets, opera and other styles; these included [[Tonin Harapi]], [[Nikolla Zoraqi]], [[Thoma Gaqi]], [[Feim Ibrahimi]] and [[Shpetim Kushta]]. Since the fall of the Communist regime, new composers like [[Aleksander Peci]], [[Sokol Shupo]], [[Endri Sina]] and [[Vasil Tole]] have arisen, as have new music institutions like the Society of Music Professionals and the Society of New Albanian Music.<ref name="frosina"/>
