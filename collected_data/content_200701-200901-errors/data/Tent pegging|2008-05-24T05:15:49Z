''credit: Peter Meade'']]'''Tent pegging''' (sometimes spelled "tentpegging" or "tent-pegging") is a [[cavalry]] sport of ancient origin, and is one of only ten [[equestrianism|equestrian]] disciplines officially recognised by the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]]. Used narrowly, the term refers to a specific mounted game with ground targets. More broadly, it refers to the entire class of mounted cavalry games involving edged weapons on horseback, for which the term "equestrian skill-at-arms" is also used.

==Essential rules==
The specific game of tent pegging has a mounted horseman riding at a gallop and using a [[sword]] or a [[lance]] to pierce, pick up, and carry away a small ground target (a symbolic tent peg) or a series of small ground targets.

The broader class of tent pegging games also includes ring [[jousting]] (in which a galloping rider tries to pass the point of his weapon through a suspended ring); lemon sticking (in which the rider tries to stab or slice a lemon suspended from a cord or sitting on a platform); [[quintain]] tilting (in which the rider charges a mannequin mounted on a swivelling or rocking pedestal); and [[horse archer|Parthian (i.e., mounted) archery]].<ref>[http://www.maharaj.org/tentpegging.shtml "Tent pegging with Unicef Team Canada"], Akaash Maharaj, 2007, retrieved [[14 January]] [[2007]]</ref>

A given tent pegging competition's rules specify the size and composition of the target; the number of consecutive targets placed on a course; the dimensions and weight of the sword, lance, or bow; the minimum time in which a course must be covered; and the extent to which a target must be struck, cut, or carried.<ref>Major General RKR Balasubramanian, ''Rules for Tent Pegging (First Edition)'', International Equestrian Federation, June 2002</ref>

==Origins==
[[Cavalry|Cavaliers]] have practised the specific game of tent pegging since at least the 4th century BC, and Asian and later European empires spread the game around the world. As a result, the game's date and location of origin are ambiguous.<ref>"Tent pegging at Hurlingham", ''Illustrated London News'', Summer 1875</ref>

In all accounts, the competitive sport evolved out of cavalry training exercises designed to develop cavaliers' prowess with the sword and lance from horseback. However, whether tent pegging developed cavaliers' generic skills or prepared them for specific combat situations is shrouded in anecdote and national [[chauvinism]].<ref>Lenox-Conyngham Papers, "Camp on the Raptee River", Cambridge University Centre of South Asian Studies, [[16 January]] [[1859]]</ref>

The most widely accepted theory<ref>[http://www.horsesport.org/regional/tent_pegging/tent_pegging.lasso? "Tent pegging recognised by the FEI"], International Equestrian Federation, 2004, retrieved [[17 May]] [[2006]]</ref> is that the game originated in medieval [[India]] as a training tool for cavaliers facing [[war elephants]]. A cavalier able to precisely stab the highly sensitive flesh behind an elephant's toenail would cause the enemy elephant to rear, unseat his [[mahout]], and possibly run amok, breaking ranks and trampling [[infantry]].

The term "tent pegging" is, however, certainly related to the idea that cavaliers mounting a surprise pre-dawn raid on an enemy camp could use the game's skills to sever or uproot tent pegs, thus collapsing the tents on their sleeping occupants and sowing havoc and terror in the camp.  However, there are few reliable accounts of a cavalry [[Squadron#Army|squadron]] ever employing such [[Military tactics|tactics]].

Because the specific game of tent pegging is the most popular equestrian skill-at-arms game, the entire class of sports became known as tent pegging during the twilight of cavalry in the twentieth century.

==Contemporary sport==

Today, tent pegging is practised around the world, but is especially popular in [[Australia]], India, [[Israel]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Olympic Council of Asia]] included tent pegging as an official sport in 1982, and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports recognised it as an official equestrian discipline in 2004.

From the results of the 2008 International Tent Pegging Championships, the world's three leading national teams are currently Canada, India, and Oman.<ref>[http://www.kanglaonline.com/index.php?template=headline&newsid=40764&typeid=3 ''Kangla''], 14 January 2008, retrieved 21 January 2008</ref>

While members of cavalry regiments and [[mounted police]] forces still dominate world-class tent pegging<ref>[http://www.usef.org/wir/01202005.html "Tent pegging competition cancelled"], United States Equestrian Federation, [[20 January]] [[2004]], retrieved [[31 May]] [[2006]]</ref>, the sport is being increasingly embraced by civilian riders.

New and emerging national tent pegging associations have helped spread the sport's popularity.  The Australian Royal Adelaide Show, the British Tent Pegging Association<ref>[http://www.equestriantoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=116&ArticleID=1114530 "Up in arms to peg back cavalry regiments"], Equestrian Today, [[15 August]] [[2005]], retrieved 02 June 2006</ref>, and the United States Cavalry Association<ref>[http://www.uscavalry.org/currentevents.html "The National Cavalry Competition"], US Cavalry Association, 2006, retrieved 02 June 2006</ref> now hold annual national championships and demonstrations in their respective countries.

The pre-eminent tent pegging games remain centred in Asia and the Middle East, with the [http://www.maharaj.org/blog-tentpegging.shtml International Tent Pegging Championships] and the continental [[Asian Games]] traditionally enjoying the highest number of competitors and participating states.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/tss/tss2612/stories/20030322005607700.htm "Indian riders to the fore"], ''The Sportstar'', [[22 March]] [[2003]], retrieved 02 June 2006</ref>

==Popular culture references==

In [[George McDonald Fraser]]'s [[Flashman]] novels, title character Harry Flashman served in a [[lancer]] regiment, and frequently mentions tent pegging and his broader skills with the lance.
