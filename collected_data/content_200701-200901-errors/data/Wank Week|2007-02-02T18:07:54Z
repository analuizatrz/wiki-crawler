'''Wank Week''' was a season of programming to be shown by [[Channel 4]] in March 2007. It was announced on [[July 18]], [[2006]]. <ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1823630,00.html Guardian.co.uk "Wank Week" reference</ref>

The week was expected to consist of a series of documentary programmes about masturbation. 

An independent production company, Zig-Zag Productions, filmed one of the shows at a [[Masturbate-a-thon]] held in London in August 2006. A press release from Zig-Zag promised that the film would find out "if the only things allowed to be stiff in Britain are upper lips".

A second documentary about compulsive male masturbators was also being planned. The series was due to finish with a film called ''Masturbation For Girls'', made by a company called Spun Gold, featuring the sex educationalist Dr [[Betty Dodson]]. <ref>http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1871424,00.html Guardian.co.uk "Masturbation For Girls" reference</ref>

The series was due to be screened in March 2007, however it was abandoned by Channel 4, in order to avoid further controversy following the [[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 racism controversy]].<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a42343/channel-4-abandons-wank-week.html Channel 4 'abandons' "wank week"</ref> The three scheduled programmes are due to be broadcast separately later in 2007.

Channel 4, a public service broadcaster supported by advertising, frequently courts controversy. Its former chief executive, [[Michael Grade]], was nicknamed "pornographer in chief" by the conservative tabloid, ''[[The Daily Mail]]''. Grade subsequently became Chairman of the [[BBC]].
