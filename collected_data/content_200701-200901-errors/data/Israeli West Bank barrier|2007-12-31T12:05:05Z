Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000.…An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing 250-mile network of concrete walls, high-tech fencing and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. ‘The security fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,’ said Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces.…Opponents of the wall grudgingly acknowledge that it's been effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian territories known as the Green Line.</small>

Now, 4,000 people - 10 per cent of the population - have left. An additional 2,200 heads of household have gone to find work elsewhere, leaving their families behind.…Unemployment is now 69 per cent. With its bottleneck entrance so often corked, the town is coming close to economic strangulation. More than 600 businesses have closed and many residents have been unable to pay their municipal taxes, with the result that the Qalquilya municipality owes approximately 3.5m shekels (£490,000) to the Israeli Electric Company, which is threatening to cut off the city's supply.…The story of overcrowding and economic peril will be repeated in other Palestinian cities, according to Jamal Juma, co-ordinator of the Palestinian Environmental Network: ‘In 10 years, there will be no room to expand. Forced off the land, Palestinians will be clustered into already heavily populated urban areas; with no alternative sources of income, they will be a source of cheap labour for Israeli factories.’</small>

A similar barrier, the [[Israeli Gaza Strip barrier]], was constructed in 1994 largely on the 1949 armistice line between Israel and the Gaza Strip, and has been much less controversial.

== Overview ==
=== Names of the barrier ===
The naming of the barrier is controversial. Israelis most commonly refer to the barrier as the "separation ''(hafrada)'' fence" ({{Audio|He-Gader_Hahafrada.ogg|גדר ההפרדה}}, ''gader ha'hafrada'' or ''geder ha'hafrada'') and "security fence" or "anti-terrorist fence", with "[[seam zone]]" referring to the land between the fence and the 1949 armistice lines.

Palestinians most commonly refer to the barrier in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as {{Audio|ArWestBankBarrier.ogg|"''jidar al-fasl al-'unsuri''"}}, (racial segregation wall), and  some opponents of the barrier refer to it in English as the "Apartheid Wall".<ref name = "Al-J Wall">{{cite web

Sometimes various other names including separation/security and fence/wall/barrier are used.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

=== History and stated purpose ===
The idea of creating a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations was first proposed by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in 1992, following the murder of an Israeli teenage girl in Jerusalem. Rabin said that Israel must "take [[Gaza]] out of [[Tel Aviv]]", in order to minimize friction between the peoples.<ref name = "Makovsky">{{cite journal

}}
</ref> Following an outbreak of violent incidents in Gaza in October 1994, Rabin announced his stance that "we have to decide on separation as a philosophy. There has to be a clear border. Without demarcating the lines, whoever wants to swallow 1.8 million Arabs will just bring greater support for [[Hamas]]."<ref name = "Makovsky" />

To this end, the government of Yitzhak Rabin built the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier in 1994. Following an attack on [[HaSharon Junction]], near the city of [[Netanya]], Rabin made his goals more specific:

<blockquote>This path must lead to a separation, though not according to the borders prior to 1967. We want to reach a separation between us and them. We do not want a majority of the Jewish residents of the state of Israel, 98% of whom live within the borders of sovereign Israel, including a united Jerusalem, to be subject to terrorism.</blockquote>

In early 1995, the Shahal commission was established by Yitzhak Rabin to discuss how to implement a barrier separating Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]], prior to the [[Camp David 2000 Summit]] with [[Yasser Arafat]], vowed to build a separation barrier, stating that it is "essential to the Palestinian nation in order to foster its national identity and independence without being dependent on the State of Israel".<ref name = "Makovsky" />

The Israeli Supreme Court made reference to the conditions and history that led to the building of the barrier. In the September 2005 decision,<ref name = "HCF" /> it described the history of violence against Israeli citizens since the breakout of [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] and the loss of life that ensued on the Israeli side. The court ruling also cited the attempts Israel had made to defend its citizens, including "military operations" carried out against "terrorist acts", and stated that these actions...
<blockquote>
...did not provide a sufficient answer to the immediate need to stop the severe acts of terrorism. . . . Despite all these measures, the terror did not come to an end. The attacks did not cease. Innocent people paid with both life and limb. This is the background behind the decision to construct the separation fence (Id., at p. 815)</blockquote>

==== Grassroots effort ====
In June 2001 a [[Grassroots democracy|grass roots organization]] called "[[Fence for Life]] - The Public Movement for The Security Fence"<!--ref>http://www.hagader.com/English/main.asp</ref--> began the grassroots effort for the construction of a continuous security fence. The movement was founded by people from all over Israel following the [[Dolphinarium massacre]]. 

The goal of the Movement, is to encourage the government to construct a Security Fence along Israel's borders. "Fence for Life" urged the government to build a continuous Fence as speedily as possible, and without any connection to the political future of the areas it separates, with a goal of hermetically sealing off the Palestinian territories from Israeli population centers to prevent the terrorist acts by Palestinians against the people living in Israel. 

From the very beginning of its public campaign , "Fence for Life" emphasized that any Security Fence has no connection whatsoever to the political future of the settlements. The Movement for the Security Fence for Israel included protests, demonstrations, conferences with public figures, media blitzes, lobbying in the Knesset as well as legal battles in the High Court of Justice, both with demands to quickly build the Security Fence as well as appeals not to cause further delay in construction. The Movement does not support any specific path for the Barrier, as this is subject to a government decision. "Fence for Life" was of the opinion that “politicization” of the Fence by various groups was delaying the completion of the Security Barrier and is likely to block its construction. At the end of 2002, due to government inaction, several localities who suffered the most from lack of a border barrier had started to build the barrier using their own funds directly on the green-line.<ref name = "Gilboa">{{cite web

}}
</ref>

==== Government action ====
Although the government of Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was initially hesitant to construct the barrier, he finally embraced the plan. The stated purpose of the barrier is to prevent [[terrorism|terrorists]] from entering Israeli cities, a problem which has plagued Israel since the start of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|Second Intifada]]. A secondary purpose of the barrier is to prevent illegal infiltrations by Palestinians, mainly illegal immigrants and car thieves. The Israeli government says that the high concrete portions are to protect cars and people on the Israeli side from gunfire. Many Israelis note the danger of terrorist incursions from the area, such as waves of [[Suicide attack|suicide bombings]] in early 2002.
{{seealso|List of massacres committed during the Al-Aqsa Intifada}}

According to [[Natan Sharansky]], Minister of Housing and Construction at the time:
<blockquote>When Israel's free society was defending itself against an unprecedented campaign of terror, most of the international community was calling for an end of the "cycle of violence" and a return to the negotiating table. When the Palestinian terrorists struck... Israel was condemned for imposing "collective punishment" on the Palestinian population. When Israel chose to target individual terrorists with precision air strikes, its actions were condemned as illegal extrajudicial assassinations. It seemed that in eyes of many, the Jews had a right to defend themselves in theory but could not exercise that right in practice... our government understood that there were three options to maintain an acceptable level of security for our citizens. The first was to wage a total war against Palestinian terror using weapons that would claim many innocent Palestinian lives. The second was to keep our reserves constantly mobilized to defend the country. The third option was to build the security fence. Had the Palestinian Authority become a partner in fighting terror, as it was obliged to do under all the [[Oslo Accords|agreements that it signed]], none of these options would have become necessary.<ref>Natan Sharansky: ''[[The Case for Democracy]]'' p.214</ref></blockquote>

=== Route and route timeline ===
The barrier generally runs along or near the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|1949 Jordanian-Israeli armistice]]/[[Green Line (Demarcation Line)|Green Line]], but diverges in many places to include on the Israeli side several of the highly populated areas of [[Jewish settlements]] in the [[West Bank]] such as [[East Jerusalem]], [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]], [[Gush Etzion]], [[Emmanuel]], [[Karnei Shomron]], [[Givat Ze'ev]], [[Oranit]], and [[Maale Adumim]].<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Because of the complex path it follows, most of the barrier is actually set in the West Bank.<ref name = "BTStat" /> It diverges from the "Green Line" by anywhere from 200 meters to as much as 20 [[kilometers]], with the result that many [[Israeli settlement]]s in the West Bank remain on the Israeli side of the barrier, and some Palestinian towns are nearly encircled by it. Approximately 20% is actually on the Green Line.<ref>http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/659581cf3863644f85256fbf0068c624!OpenDocument</ref> The proponents of the barrier claim that its route is not set in stone, as it was challenged in court and changed several times. They note that the [[cease-fire]] line of 1949 was negotiated "without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines" (Art. VI.9).<ref>http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/arm03.htm</ref> Security experts argue that the [[topography]] does not permit putting the barrier along the Green Line in some places, because hills or tall buildings on the Palestinian side would make the barrier ineffective against terrorism.<ref>http://www.mideastweb.org/thefence.htm</ref> The International Court of Justice has countered that in such cases it is only legal to build the barrier inside Israel.
[[Image:West Bank Fence South Hebron.JPG|thumb|Israeli West Bank Barrier - North of [[Meitar]], near the south west corner of the West Bank.]]
As of November 2003, the barrier extends inside most of the northwestern and western edges of the West Bank, sometimes close to the Green Line, and sometimes running further east. In some places there are also secondary barriers, creating a number of completely enclosed [[enclave]]s. 

In February 2004, Israel said it would review the route of the barrier in response to U.S. and Palestinian concerns. In particular, Israeli cabinet members said modifications would be made to reduce the number of checkpoints Palestinians had to cross, and especially to reduce Palestinian hardship in areas such as [[Qalqilyah]] where the barrier goes very near, and in some cases nearly encircles, populated areas.

On [[June 30]], [[2004]], the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that a portion of the barrier west of Jerusalem violates the rights of Palestinians, and ordered 30&nbsp;km of existing and planned barrier to be rerouted. However, it did rule that the barrier is legal in essence and accepted the Israeli government's claim that it is a security measure. On [[July 9]], [[2004]], the [[International Court of Justice]] issued an advisory opinion that it is a violation of international law. At the beginning of September 2004, Israel started the southern part of the barrier.

On [[February 20]], [[2005]], the Israeli cabinet approved a new route. The new route is 681 kilometers and would leave approximately seven percent of the West Bank and 10,000 [[Palestinian]]s on the Israeli side. ([http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/maps/fence10.jpg Map]) Before that time, the exact route of the barrier had not been finalized, and it had been alleged by opponents that the barrier route would encircle the [[Samaria|Samarian highlands]] of the West Bank, separating them from the [[Jordan valley]].<ref>http://www.arij.org/paleye/Segregation-Wall/7.5%20The%20full%20extent%20of%20the%20segregation%20Zones%20in%20the%20West%20Bank.pdf</ref> 

Following a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, the route was again revised by a cabinet decision on [[April 30]], [[2006]].<ref>http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/04/israel-cabinet-approves-changes-to.php</ref> The route<ref>http://www.seamzone.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/images/Seamzone_map_eng.jpg</ref><ref>http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/WB_Barrier_Overview_Changes_July06.pdf</ref> now leaves fewer Palestinians and less West Bank land on the Israeli side of the barrier. In the [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]] area, the new route corrects an anomaly of the previous route that would have left thousands of Palestinians on the Israeli side. The [[Alfei Menashe]] settlement bloc was reduced in size, and the new plan leaves three groups of Palestinian houses on the Palestinian side of the fence. The barrier's route in the Jerusalem area will leave Beit Iksa on the Palestinian side; and Jaba on the Israeli side, but with a crossing to the Palestinian side at Tzurif. Further changes were made to the route around [[Eshkolot]] and [[Metzadot Yehuda]], and the route from Metzadot to Har Choled was approved.<ref>http://www.seamzone.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/news.htm#news45</ref>

See also [[1949 Armistice Agreements#Cease-fire line vs. permanent border|The 1949 Cease-fire line vs. the permanent border]].

=== Structure ===
Most of the barrier (over 95% of total length) consists of a "multi-layered fence system" <ref>http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/operational.htm</ref> ideally 50&nbsp;m in width. The IDF's preferred design has three fences, with pyramid-shaped stacks of barbed wire for the two outer fences and a lighter-weight fence with intrusion detection equipment in the middle. Patrol roads are provided on both sides of the middle fence, an anti-vehicle ditch is located on the West Bank side of the fence, and a smooth dirt strip on the Israeli side for "intrusion tracking". 

Some sections (less than 5% of total length) are constructed as a wall made up of concrete slabs up to 8&nbsp;m in height and 3&nbsp;m in width. Occasionally, due to topographic conditions other sections of the barrier will reach up to 100&nbsp;m in width.<ref>http://www.nad-plo.org/palisraeli/wall/related/bwall.pdf</ref> Wall construction (5%) is more common in urban settings, such as areas near Qalqilyah and [[Jerusalem]], because it is narrower, requires less land, and provides more protection against snipers. In all cases there are regular observation posts, automated sensing devices and other apparatus. Gates at various points are controlled by Israeli soldiers.

Israeli statistics indicate that the barrier has drastically reduced the number of Palestinian infiltrations and suicide bombings and other attacks on civilians in Israel and in Israeli settlements, and Israeli officials assert that completion of the barrier will make it even more effective in stopping these attacks<ref>http://securityfence.mfa.gov.il/mfm/Data/48152.doc</ref> since "An absolute halt in terrorist activities has been noticed in the West Bank areas where the fence has been constructed".<ref>http://www.nclci.org/news/terrorism_news.htm</ref> 

Israeli officers, including the head of the [[Shin Bet]], quoted in the newspaper ''[[Maariv]]'', have claimed that in the areas where the barrier was complete, the number of hostile infiltrations has decreased to almost zero. Maariv also stated that Palestinian militants, including a senior member of [[Islamic Jihad]], had confirmed that the barrier made it much harder to conduct attacks inside Israel. Since the completion of the fence in the area of [[Tulkarem]] and Qalqilyah in June 2003, there have been no successful attacks from those areas. All attacks were intercepted or the [[suicide bomber]]s detonated prematurely.<ref name = "Makovsky" />

There is general agreement that effects to date have coincided with improved Israeli security.<ref name = "McClatchy" /><ref name = "Q26">{{cite web

</ref>

However, there is debate over how effective the barrier has been in preventing terrorist attacks. A report by the [[Shin Beit]], published in early 2006 notes that terror attacks in 2005 have significantly decreased due to increased pursuing of Palestinian militants by the Israeli army and intelligence organizations, Hamas's increased political activity, and a truce among Palestinian militant groups in the Palestinian Territories. According to ''[[Haaretz]]'' the report also mentions that "The security fence is no longer mentioned as the major factor in preventing suicide bombings, mainly because the terrorists have found ways to bypass it."<ref name="Shin Bet Truce">{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=664916|title=Shin Bet: Palestinian truce main cause for reduced terror|accessdate=2007-08-11|publisher=Haaretz|year=2006|author=Amos Hrel}}</ref>

=== Effects on demography and asset values ===
According to a 2005 report published by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, the barrier being built around Jerusalem may have unintended effects on the city. According to the study, many Jerusalem Palestinians who were living in areas outside the barrier are now moving back into the city, creating housing shortages, increased real estate prices, and the phenomena of Palestinians moving into traditionally Jewish neighborhoods of the city.<ref>http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=632264</ref>

=== Effects on Palestinians ===

The barrier has many effects on Palestinians including reduced freedoms, reduction of [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|Israeli checkpoint]] and closures, loss of land, increased difficulty in accessing medical services in Israel, change in political tactics and strategy, and economic effects.

==== Reduced freedoms ====
In a recent report, the [[UN]] stated that: <blockquote>...it is difficult to overstate the humanitarian impact of the Barrier. The route inside the West Bank severs communities, people’s access to services, livelihoods and religious and cultural amenities. In addition, plans for the Barrier’s exact route and crossing points through it are often not fully revealed until days before construction commences. This has led to considerable anxiety amongst Palestinians about how their future lives will be impacted...The land between the Barrier and the Green Line constitutes some of the most fertile in the West Bank. It is currently the home for 49,400 West Bank Palestinians living in 38 villages and towns.<ref>http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/OCHABarRprt05_Full.pdf</ref></blockquote>

An often-quoted example of the effects of the barrier is the Palestinian town of [[Qalqilyah]], a city of around 45,000, where an 8 meter-high concrete section is built on the [[Green Line]] between the city and the nearby [[Highway 6 (Israel)|Trans-Israel Highway]]. The wall in this section, referred to as an "anti-sniper wall," has been claimed to prevent gun attacks against Israeli motorists and the Israeli town of [[Kfar Saba]],<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3111159.stm</ref> The city is accessible through a main road from the east, and an underground tunnel built in September 2004 on the south side connects Qalqilyah with the adjacent village of Habla. Recently, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the government to change the route of the barrier in this area to ease movement of Palestinians between Qalqilyah and 5 surrounding villages. In the same ruling, the court rejected the arguments that the fence must be built only on the Green Line. The ruling cited the topography of the terrain, security considerations, and sections 43 and 52 of The Hague Regulations 1907 and Article 53 of the 4th Geneva Convention as reasons for this rejection.<ref name = "HCF" />
[[Image:Palestinian children and Israeli wall.jpg|thumb|Palestinian children running towards the Israeli West Bank Barrier (August 2004).]]

In early October 2003, the IDF OC [[Israeli Central Command|Central Command]] declared the area between the separation barrier in the northern section of the West Bank (Stage 1) and the Green Line a closed military area for an indefinite period of time. New directives stated that every Palestinian over the age of twelve living in the enclaves created in the closed area have to obtain a “permanent resident permit” from the Civil Administration to enable them to continue to live in their homes. Other residents of the West Bank have to obtain special permits to enter the area.<ref name = "BTStat" />

==== Decreased checkpoints and closures ====
In June 2004, the Washington Times<ref>http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20040624-112922-9037r.htm</ref> reported that the reduced need for Israeli military incursions in Jenin have prompted efforts to rebuild damaged streets and buildings and a gradual return to a semblance of normalcy, and in a letter<ref>http://www.israel-un.org/committees/duggardrprt.htm</ref> dated [[October 25]], [[2004]], from the Israeli mission to [[Kofi Annan]], Israel's government pointed out that a number of restrictions east of the barrier have been lifted as a result of the barrier, including a reduction in checkpoints from 71 to 47 and roadblocks from 197 to 111. [[The Jerusalem Post]] reports that, for some Palestinians who are Israeli citizens living in the [[Israeli Arab]] town of [[Umm el-Fahm]] (population 42,000) near [[Jenin]], the barrier has "significantly improved their lives" because, on one hand, it prevents would-be thieves or terrorists from coming to their town and, on the other hand, has increased the flow of customers from other parts of Israel who would normally have patronised Palestinian business in the West Bank, resulting in an economic boom. The report states that the downsides are that the barrier has divided families in half and "damaged Israeli Arabs' solidarity with the Palestinians living on the other side of the Green Line".<ref>http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer&cid=1087441302553</ref>

A UN report released in August 2005 observed that the existence of the barrier "replaced the need for closures: movement within the northern West Bank, for example, is less restrictive where the Barrier has been constructed. Physical obstacles have also been removed in Ramallah and Jerusalem governorates where the Barrier is under construction." The report notes that more freedom of movement in rural areas may ease Palestinian access to hospitals and schools, but also notes that restrictions on movement between urban population centers have not significantly changed.<ref>http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/ochaHU0805_En.pdf</ref><!--

====Political impact====
The barrier's political impact is quite substantial and not what one might expect. The mere prospect of the wall already has created a bizarre political situation: "The barrier has united, of all people, the Palestinians and their arch-enemies, the Jewish settlers. The settlers oppose the wall because they are left outside its protection. The Palestinians oppose it because it looks like a unilateral drawing of borders by Israel. On the other side are Israelis who don't live on settlements. [sic] One recent poll shows 68% approval of the wall, which would protect major cities that have been subjected to bombings. If the Palestinians come to their senses, they'll realize that the current terrorism policy, which is producing the wall and economic isolation, will leave them worse off in every way.... Yet the wall also holds the seeds of a peace deal. It would in effect be a secure border for Israel precisely where the Palestinians want it.... It's hardly inevitable, but the wall just might be a surprising start down the road to a Middle East peace deal."<ref>http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jul2002/nf20020718_1722.htm</ref>/ -->

====Loss of land====
{{seealso|Seam Zone|House demolition in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict}}

Parts of the barrier are built on land confiscated from Palestinians.<ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/11/05/mideast</ref><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3111159.stm</ref> In a recent report, the [[UN]] noted that the most recent barrier route allocates more segments to be built on the Green Line itself compared to previous draft routes of the barrier.<ref>http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/OCHABarRprt05_Full.pdf</ref>

As of May 2004, the fence construction had already uprooted an estimated 102,320 Palestinian olive and citrus trees, demolished 75 acres (0.3&nbsp;km²) of greenhouses and 23&nbsp;miles (37&nbsp;km) of irrigation pipes. At that point, it rested on 15,000 dunums (3,705&nbsp;acres or 15&nbsp;km²) of confiscated land, only meters away from a number of small villages, or hamlets. In early 2003, in order to move a section of the barrier to the Green Line, a ramshackle mall of 63 shops straddling that line into Israel was demolished by the IDF in the village of [[Nazlat Issa]] <!--after giving their owners 30-minutes notice/!-->.<ref>http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/Barrierupdate7mar04.pdf</ref><ref>http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C10FE3B540C718EDDA80894DB404482</ref><ref>http://www.unitedjerusalem.org/index2.asp?id=221525&Date=1/22/2003</ref> In August of that year, an additional 115 shops/stalls (an important source of income for several communities)<!--even your UN source says this, again stop removing sourced material/!--> and five to seven homes were also demolished there.<ref>http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=2401&CategoryId=4</ref><ref>http://www.palestinemonitor.org/factsheet/wall_fact_sheet.htm</ref> The Israeli Government has promised that trees affected by the construction will be replanted.<ref>http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+since+2000/Saving%20Lives-%20Israel-s%20anti-terrorist%20fence%20-%20Answ</ref> 

According to the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA), 15 communities were to be directly affected, numbering approximately 138,593 Palestinians, including 13,450 refugee families, or 67,250 individuals. In addition to loss of land, in the city of Qalqilyah one-third of the city's water wells lie on the other side of the barrier. The Israeli Supreme Court notes the Israeli government's rejection of accusations of a ''de facto'' annexation of these wells, stating that "the construction of the fence does not affect the implementation of the water agreements determined in the (interim) agreement".<ref name = "HCF" />

====Health and medical services====
[[Médecins du Monde]], the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Palestinian Red Crescent Society]] and [[Physicians for Human Rights|Physicians for Human Rights-Israel]] have stated that the barrier "harms West Bank health".<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4268079.stm</ref> Upon completion of the construction, the organizations predict, the barrier would prevent over 130,000 Palestinian children from being immunised, and deny more than 100,000 pregnant women (out of which 17,640 are high risk pregnancies) access to healthcare in Israel. In addition, almost a third of West Bank villages will suffer from lack of access to healthcare. After completion, many residents may lose complete access to emergency care at night. In towns near Jerusalem ([[Abu Dis]] and Aizaria), for example, average time for an ambulance to travel to the nearest hospital has increased from 10 minutes to over 110 minutes.<ref>http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7488/381</ref> 

A report from [[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel]] also states that the barrier imposes "almost-total separation" on the hospitals from the population they are supposed to serve.<ref>http://www.phr.org.il/phr/files/articlefile_1134502825051.doc</ref> The report also noted that patients from the West Bank visiting Jerusalem's Palestinian clinics declined by half from 2002 to 2003.

====Change in tactics and strategy====
Members of [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]], [[Hamas]], and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] have been less able to conduct terrorist attacks, the numbers of which have decreased in areas where the barrier has been completed.<!-- BROKEN [http://www.nclci.org/news/terrorism_news.htm] --><ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/fence.html Israel’s Security Fence] ([[Jewish Virtual Library]])</ref> Daniel Ayalon, Israel's ambassador to the [[United States]], suggested that reduced ability to conduct terrorist attacks would "save the political process" because the barrier would neutralize the ability of terrorist groups "to hold that process hostage" by conducting these devastating acts.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20030825-090132-1658r.htm Israel's ambassador defends security fence] by Daniel Ayalon (''The Washington Times'') August 26, 2003</ref>

In his interview to [[Al-Manar TV]], Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader [[Ramadan Abdullah Mohammad Shallah|Ramadan Salah]] admitted that the barrier is an important obstacle, and that "if it weren’t there, the situation would be entirely different."<ref>[http://www.intelligence.org.il/eng/eng_n/html/pij151106e.htm Bulletin on November 11, PIJ leader Abdallah Ramadan Shalah interview to Al-Manar TV] (Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies (C.S.S)).

====Economic changes====
[[Real GDP]] growth in the West Bank increased modestly in 2003, 2004, and 2005 after declining in 2000, 2001, and 2002 (see Figure 1). However, these drops in economic productivity came before the construction of the barrier began. In 2005, the PNA Ministry of Finance cited the 2003 "construction of the separation wall" as one reason for the depressed Palestinian economic activity.[http://www.mof.gov.ps/english/Press_Coverage/press%20release.pdf]

According to the Palestinian Negotiations Affairs Department (NAD) and other sources, 45% of Qalqilyah's farmland<ref>http://www.miftah.org/display.cfm?DocId=1754&CategoryId=4</ref><ref>http://www.nad-plo.org/facts/wall/WallMagazine%207-2005.pdf</ref> now lie outside the barrier, and farmers require permits from Israeli authorities to access their lands that are on the opposite side. There are three gates in the barrier for the purpose of admitting farmers with permits to their fields that are open 3 times a day for a total of 50 minutes,<ref>http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/750/focus.htm</ref> although according to the NAD they have often been arbitrarily closed for extended periods leading to loss of crops, and one of these gates has been closed since August 2004 due to a suicide attack that took place near the gate. The Israeli Human Rights center [[B'Tselem]] notes that "thousands of Palestinians have difficulty going to their fields and marketing their produce in other areas of the West Bank. Farming is a primary source of income in the Palestinian communities situated along the Barrier's route, an area that constitutes one of the most fertile areas in the West Bank. The harm to the farming sector is liable to have drastic economic effects on the residents – whose economic situation is already very difficult – and drive many families into poverty".<ref>http://www.btselem.org/English/Separation_Barrier/index.asp</ref><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4830654.stm</ref>

== Legal issues ==
=== Israeli Supreme Court rulings ===
{{main|Israeli West Bank Barrier, Israeli Supreme Court Opinions}}
On two occasions the Israeli government has been instructed by the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] to alter the route of the barrier to ensure that negative impacts on Palestinians would be minimized and proportional.<ref>http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/04/560/020/a28/04020560.a28.pdf</ref><ref>http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/04/570/079/a14/04079570.a14.pdf</ref>

=== United Nations and International Court of Justice ===
{{seealso|International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict}}
In 2004, the [[United Nations]] passed a number of resolutions and the [[International Court of Justice]], following hearings in which Israel did not participate, issued an [[advisory opinion]] calling for the barrier to be removed and the Arab residents to be compensated for any damage done: "The Court finds that the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and its associated régime are contrary to international law". <ref>http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/85255e950050831085255e95004fa9c3/3740e39487a5428a85256ecc005e157a!OpenDocument</ref>

== Opinions on the barrier==
===Israeli opinions===
Israeli public opinion has been very strongly in favor of the barrier, partly in the hope that it will improve security and partly in the belief that the barrier marks the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|eventual border of a Palestinian state]]. Due to the latter possibility, the settler movement opposes the barrier, although this opposition has waned since it became clear the barrier would be diverted to the east of major [[Israeli settlement]]s such as [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]]. According to [[Haaretz]], a survey conducted by of the [[Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research]], [[Tel Aviv University]], there is an overwhelming support for the barrier among the Jewish population of Israel: 84% on March 2004 and 78% on June 2004.<ref>http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=402996&contrassID=1</ref>

Most Israelis believe the barrier and intensive activity by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] to be the main factors in the decrease in successful [[suicide attack]] from the [[West Bank]]. The proponents of the barrier insist that reversible inconveniences to Palestinians should be balanced with the threats to lives of Israeli civilians and point out that the barrier is a non-violent way to stop terrorism and save innocent lives.

However, there are some Israelis who oppose the barrier. The Israeli [[Peace Now]] movement has stated that while they would support a barrier that follows the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|1949 Armistice lines]], the "current route of the fence is intended to destroy all chances of a future  peace settlement with the Palestinians and to annex as much land as possible  from the West Bank" and that  the barrier would "only increase the blood to be split on both sides and continue the sacrificing  of Israeli and Palestinian lives for the settlements." <ref>http://www.peacenow.org.il/site/en/peace.asp?pi=69&docid=1237&pos=2</ref>

Additionally, many Israelis living in settlements, such as the [[Gush Etzion]] area, oppose the fence because it separates them from the rest of Israel. They argue that building the fence defines a border, and that they are being left out. According to most settlers, all of the West Bank belongs to Israel, and separating any of it with a fence is the first step in giving the land away.<ref name ="Women in Green"/>

Some Israeli left wing activists, such as [[Anarchists Against the Wall]] and [[Gush Shalom]] are active in protests against the barrier, especially in the West Bank towns of [[Bil'in]] and [[Jayyous]].<ref>http://www.awalls.org/</ref><ref>http://zope.gush-shalom.org/home/en/channels/video/bilin-2006-01-20/</ref>

===Palestinian opinions===
The Palestinian population and its leadership are essentially unanimous in opposing the barrier. A significant number of Palestinians have been separated from their own farmlands or their places of work or study, and many more will be separated as the barriers near [[Jerusalem]] are completed. Furthermore, because of its planned route as published by the Israeli government, the barrier is perceived as a plan to confine the Palestinian population to specific areas, causing further humiliation.<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/09/MNGIP5H0IL1.DTL</ref><ref>http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=248438</ref> They state that Palestinian institutions in [[Abu Dis]] will be prevented from providing services to residents in the [[East Jerusalem]] suburbs, and that a 10-minute walk has become a 3-hour drive in order to reach a gate, to go (if allowed) through a crowded military checkpoint, and drive back to the destination on the other side.<ref>http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engmde150162004</ref>

More broadly, Palestinian spokespersons, supported by many in the Israeli left wing and other organizations, claim that the hardships imposed by the barrier will breed further discontent amongst the affected population and add to the security problem rather than solving it. 

On [[April 14]], [[2004]], American President [[George W. Bush]] said "In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a [[two-state solution]] have reached the same conclusion.”<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/04/20040414-4.html</ref> In direct reaction to Bush's comments, the leadership of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] accused the U.S. of rewarding construction of the barrier and replied, "[t]he US assurances are being made at the expense of the Palestinian people and the Arab world without the knowledge of the legitimate Palestinian leadership. They are rewarding illegal occupation, settlement and the [[apartheid wall]]."<ref>http://www.mideastweb.org/log/archives/00000244.htm</ref>

===International opinions===
{{seealso|Road map for peace}}

====The United Nations====
In October 2003, a [[United Nations]] resolution to declare the barrier illegal where it deviates from the green line and should be torn down was vetoed by the US in the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. vetoes U.N. resolution on Israeli wall|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=October 15, 2003|accessdate=05.21.2007|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/15/Worldandnation/US_vetoes_UN_resoluti.shtml}}</ref> In December 2003, it was accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (with four votes against).<ref name=UNISPAL>{{cite web|title=Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall

====The Red Cross====
The [[Red Cross]] has decared the barrier in violation of the [[Geneva Convention]]. On [[February 18]], [[2004]], The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] stated that the Israeli barrier "causes serious humanitarian and legal problems" and goes "far beyond what is permissible for an occupying power".<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3498795.stm</ref> 

====Human rights organizations====
[[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and other [[Human rights groups and the Middle East|Human rights groups]] have protested both the routing of the wall and the means by which the land to build the wall was obtained.<ref>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/03/10/isrlpa10290.htm] [[Human Rights Watch]]</ref> In a 2004 report Amnesty International wrote that "The fence/wall, in its present configuration, violates Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law."<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engmde150332004] [[Amnesty International]]</ref>

They continue:
<blockquote>Since the summer of 2002 the Israeli army has been destroying large areas of Palestinian agricultural land, as well as other properties, to make way for a fence/wall which it is building in the West Bank.

In addition to the large areas of particularly fertile Palestinian farmland that have been destroyed, other larger areas have been cut off from the rest of the West Bank by the fence/wall.

The fence/wall is not being built between Israel and the Occupied Territories but mostly (close to 90%) inside the West Bank, turning Palestinian towns and villages into isolated enclaves, cutting off communities and families from each other, separating farmers from their land and Palestinians from their places of work, education and health care facilities and other essential services. This in order to facilitate passage between Israel and more than 50 illegal Israeli settlements located in the West Bank.<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engmde150332004] [[Amnesty International]]</ref></blockquote>

====The World Council of Churches====
On [[February 20]], [[2004]] the [[World Council of Churches]] adopted a statement demanding that Israel halt and reverse construction on the barrier and strongly condemning what they believe to be violations of human rights and humanitarian consequences that have resulted due to construction of the barrier. While acknowledging Israel's serious security concerns and asserting that the construction of the barrier on its own territory would not have been a violation of international law, the statement rejected what it saw as the creation of a new political boundary that confiscates Palestinian land.<ref>http://www.eappi.org/pressreleasesen.nsf/index/pu-04-11.html</ref>

====Foreign governments====
Some international governments agree that Israel should have the right to [[Use of force by states|self-defense as far as it is recognized under international law]], but oppose the construction of the barrier outside the 1949 armistice lines as a violation of Palestinian rights.

On [[July 25]], [[2003]], President [[George W. Bush]] said "I think the wall is a problem. And I discussed this with Ariel Sharon. It is very difficult to develop confidence between the Palestinians and Israel with a wall snaking through the West Bank."<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/07/20030725-6.html</ref> The following year, addressing the issue of the barrier as a future border, he said in a letter to Sharon on [[April 14]] 2004 that it "should be a security rather than political barrier, should be temporary rather than permanent and therefore not prejudice any final status issues including final borders, and its route should take into account, consistent with security needs, its impact on Palestinians not engaged in terrorist activities."<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3111159.stm</ref> President Bush reiterated this position during a [[May 26]], [[2005]] joint press conference with Palestinian leader [[Mahmoud Abbas]] in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]].<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/05/20050526.html</ref>

====Artists====
[[Image:Rockboy.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Graffiti on the wall by [[Banksy]]]]
[[Graffiti]] on the Palestinian side of walled sections of the barrier has consistently been one of many forms of protest against its existence. Large areas of the walls feature messages relating to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], demanding an end to the barrier, or criticizing its builders and its existence ('Welcome to the [[Ghetto]]-Abu Dis'). In August 2005, the U.K. graffiti artist [[Banksy]] painted nine images on the Palestinian side of the barrier.<ref>http://www.banksy.co.uk/outdoors/horizontal_1.htm</ref> He describes the barrier as "the ultimate activity holiday destination for graffiti writers". On [[21 June]] [[2006]], [[Roger Waters]] wrote "Tear down the wall" on the wall, a phrase from the [[Pink Floyd]] song [[Another brick in the wall]]. <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5104930.stm</ref>

=== Borders opinions ===
Some speculate that because sections of the barrier are built not along the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] but in the West Bank, the real purpose is to acquire territory.<ref>http://www.btselem.org/english/Publications/summaries/200512_Under_the_Guise_of_Security.asp</ref> Some people describe the barrier as the ''de facto'' future border of the [[Israel|State of Israel]]. [[James Zogby]], president of the Arab American Institute, has said that the barrier has "unilaterally helped to demarcate the route for future Israeli control over huge West Bank settlement blocks and large swathes of West Bank land".<ref>http://www.palestinechronicle.com/story.php?sid=20050422063320440</ref> According to [[B'Tselem]], "the overall features of the separation barrier and the considerations that led to determination of the route give the impression that Israel is relying on security arguments to unilaterally establish facts on the ground ..."<ref>http://www.btselem.org/English/Separation_Barrier/index.asp</ref> Chris McGreal in [[The Guardian]] writes that the barrier is, "evidently intended to redraw Israel's borders".<ref name = "McGreal1">{{cite web

[[Yossi Klein Halevi]], Israeli correspondent for [[The New Republic]], writes of the barrier that "[b]uilding over the green line, by contrast, reminds Palestinians that every time they've rejected compromise&mdash;whether in [[Peel Commission|1937]], [[1947 UN Partition Plan|1947]], or [[Camp David 2000 Summit|2000]]&mdash;the potential map of [[Palestinian state|Palestine]] shrinks... The fence is a warning: If Palestinians don't stop terrorism and forfeit their dream of destroying Israel, Israel may impose its own map on them... and, because Palestine isn't being restored but invented, its borders are negotiable."<ref>http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/fenced_in.htm</ref>

On [[March 9]], [[2006]], [[The New York Times]] reported then acting Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] as saying that if his [[Kadima]] party wins the upcoming national elections, he would seek to set Israel's permanent borders by 2010, and that the boundary would run along or close to the barrier.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/09/international/middleeast/09cnd-mideast.html?ex=1299560400&en=f7a513d8dac15769&ei=5088&partner</ref>

==="Apartheid" opinions===
{{main|Allegations of Israeli apartheid}}
Some opponents of the barrier claim that building and maintaining the wall is a [[crime of apartheid]]<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/sc7895.doc.htm Press Release
SC/7895], [[UN Security Council]] meeting, where the Observer for the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]] says "the form of apartheid Israel practised against Palestinians fulfilled all elements of the crime as defined under the 1976 apartheid Convention", 14 October 2003</ref>   - isolating Palestinian communities in the [[West Bank]] and consolidating the annexation of Palestinian land by [[Israeli settlement]]s. However, this is strongly disputed by others.
