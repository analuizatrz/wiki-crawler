== Classification ==

{{Main|Dravidian languages}}

Tamil belongs to the [[Southern Dravidian languages|southern]] branch of the [[Dravidian languages]], a family of around twenty-six languages native to the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Krishnamurti|2003|p=19}}</ref>  It is sometimes classified as being part of a [[Tamil languages|Tamil language family]], which alongside Tamil proper, also includes the languages of about 35 ethno-linguistic groups<ref>Prof. A.K. Perumal, Manorama Yearbook (Tamil) 2005 pp.302-318 </ref> such as the [[Irula language|Irula]], and [[Yerukala language|Yerukula]] languages (see [[SIL Ethnologue]]).  

The closest major relative of Tamil is Malayalam.  Until about the ninth century, Tamil and [[Malayalam]] were dialects of one language,<ref name="krishnamurti">{{Harvnb|Krishnamurti|2003|p=140}}</ref> called "Tamil" by the speakers of both.<ref name="freeman-1998">{{citation |last=Freeman |first=Rich |year=1998 |month=February |title=Rubies and Coral: The Lapidary Crafting of Language in Kerala |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=38-65 at p.39}}</ref>  Although many of the differences between Tamil and Malayalam evidence a pre-historic split between eastern and western dialects,<ref "malayalamorigin">{{citation | author = A.

Tamil has the oldest extant literature amongst the [[Dravidian languages]], but dating the language and the literature precisely is difficult. Literary works in India were preserved either in [[palm leaf manuscript]]s (implying repeated copying and recopying) or through oral transmission, making direct dating impossible.<ref>Dating of Indian literature is largely based on relative dating relying on internal evidences with a few anchors.

Tamil scholars categorize the history of the language into three periods, Old Tamil (300 BC - 700 CE), Middle Tamil (700 - 1600) and Modern Tamil (1600-present).<ref>Thomas Lehmann, "Old Tamil" in Sanford Steever (ed.), The Dravidian Languages Routledge, 1998 at p. 75</ref>  Epigraphic attestation of Tamil begins with rock inscriptions from the 3rd century BC, written in [[Tamil-Brahmi]], an adapted form of the [[Brahmi script]].<ref name="Maloney1970"><ref>Iravatham Mahadevan (2003).

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Tamil distribution.png|thumb|Distribution of Tamil speakers in South India and Sri Lanka (1961).]]
Tamil is the first language of the majority in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] and [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|North Eastern Province]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The language is spoken by small groups of minorities in other parts of these two countries such as [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Manipur]] and [[Maharashtra]] in case of India and [[Colombo]] and the hill country in case of Sri Lanka.

There are currently sizeable [[Tamil diaspora|Tamil-speaking populations]] descended from colonial-era migrants in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Burma]], [[Asians in South Africa|South Africa]], and [[Mauritius]]. Many people in [[Guyana]], [[Fiji]], [[Suriname]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] have Tamil origins,<ref name='ucberkeleydiaspora'> {{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/SSEAL/SouthAsia/overview.html |title=Overview of the South Asian Diaspora |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=McMahon |first=Suzanne |publisher=University of California, Berkeley }}</ref> but only a small number speak the language there. Groups of more recent migrants [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora|from Sri Lanka]] and India exist in [[Canada]] (especially [[Toronto]]), [[United States|USA]], [[Australia]], many [[Middle East]]ern countries, and most of the western [[Europe]]an countries.

===Legal status===

===Dialects===
Tamil is a [[diglossia|diglossic]] language.<ref>Arokianathan, S. [http://www.ciil-ebooks.net/html/piil/acharya2.html Writing and Diglossic: A Case Study of Tamil Radio Plays]. Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref><ref>Francis Britto. "Diglossia: A Study of the Theory, with Application to Tamil," ''Language'', Vol. 64, No. 1 (Mar., 1988), pp. 152-155. doi:10.2307/414796</ref> Tamil dialects are mainly differentiated from each other by the fact that they have undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. For example, the word for "here" —''{{IAST|iṅku}}'' in ''Centamil'' (the classic variety)—has evolved into ''{{IAST|iṅkū}}'' in the Kongu dialect of [[Coimbatore]], ''inga'' in the dialect of [[Thanjavur]],  and ''{{IAST|iṅkai}}'' in some [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects|dialects of Sri Lanka]]. Old Tamil's ''{{IAST|iṅkaṇ}}'' (where ''{{IAST|kaṇ}}'' means place) is the source of ''{{IAST|iṅkane}}'' in the dialect of [[Tirunelveli]], Old Tamil ''{{IAST|iṅkaṭṭu}}'' is the source of ''{{IAST|iṅkuṭṭu}}'' in the dialect of [[Ramanathapuram]],  and ''{{IAST|iṅkaṭe}}'' in various northern dialects.
Even now in Coimbatore area it is common to hear "{{IAST|akkaṭṭa}}" meaning "that place". 

Although Tamil dialects do not differ significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in [[Sri Lanka]] retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in [[India]],<ref>Thomas Lehmann, "Old Tamil" in Sanford Steever (ed.), ''The Dravidian Languages'' Routledge, 1998 at p. 75; E. Annamalai and S. Steever, "Modern Tamil" in ibid. at pp. 100-128.
</ref> and use many other words slightly differently.<ref>Kamil Zvelebil, "Some features of Ceylon Tamil" ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 9:2 (June 1996) pp. 113-138.</ref> The dialect of the district of [[Palakkad]] in kerala has a large number of [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] loanwords, has also been influenced by Malayalam syntax and also has a distinct Malayalam accent. [[Hebbar Iyengars|Hebbar]] and [[Mandyam]] dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] who migrated to [[Karnataka]] in the eleventh century, retain many features of the ''Vaishnava paribasai'', a special form of Tamil developed in the ninth and tenth centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values.<ref>Thiru. Mu. Kovintācāriyar, ''{{IAST|Vāḻaiyaṭi vāḻai}}'' Lifco, Madras, 1978 at pp. 26-39.</ref> Several [[caste]]s have their own [[sociolect]]s which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from.

|accessdate=2007-03-28 
|work= Encyclopædia Britannica Online
|quote=The Encyclopaedia Britannica, for example, classifies Tamil dialects into two broad sociolects, Brahmin and non-Brahmin.  ''See'' Tamil language.}}</ref>

===Spoken and literary variants===
In addition to its various dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language (''{{IAST|caṅkattamiḻ}}''), a modern literary and formal style (''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}''), and a modern [[colloquial]] form (''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}''). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write ''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}'' with a vocabulary drawn from ''{{IAST|caṅkattamiḻ}}'', or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}''.<ref>Harold Schiffman, "[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/handbuk.html Diglossia as a Sociolinguistic Situation]", in Florian Coulmas (ed.), ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1997 at pp. 205 et seq.</ref>

In modern times, ''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}'' is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of [[Tamil literature]] and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}'' has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of ''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}''. Most contemporary [[film|cinema]], [[theatre]] and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}'', and many [[politician]]s use it to bring themselves closer to their audience.  The increasing use of ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}'' in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial ‘standard’ spoken dialects. In [[India]], the ‘standard’ ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}'' is based on ‘educated non-brahmin speech’, rather than on any one dialect,<ref>Harold Schiffman, "Standardization or restandardization: The case for ‘Standard’ Spoken Tamil". ''Language in Society'' 27 (1998), pp. 359–385.</ref> but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of [[Thanjavur]] and [[Madurai]]. In [[Sri Lanka]] the standard is based on the dialect of [[Jaffna]].

== Writing system ==
{{main|Tamil script}}
[[Image:History of Tamil script.jpg|thumb|right|History of Tamil script.]]
Tamil is written using a script called the ''{{IAST|vaṭṭeḻuttu}}''.  The Tamil script consists of 12 [[vowel]]s, 18 [[consonant]]s and one special character, the ''āytam''.  The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters.  As with other [[Indic scripts]], all consonants have an inherent vowel ''a'', which in Tamil, is removed by adding an overdot called a ''{{IAST|puḷḷi}}'', to the consonantal sign.  Unlike most Indic scripts, the Tamil script does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced [[plosive]]s.  Instead, plosives are articulated with voice or unvoiced depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of [[Tamil phonology]], as discussed below.

[[Image:Vatteluttu2.png|thumb|left|An eleventh century ''{{IAST|vaṭṭeḻuttu}}'' inscription, from the [[Brihadisvara temple]] in [[Thanjavur]]]]In addition to the standard characters, six characters taken from the [[Grantha script]], which was used in the Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words borrowed from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology remains, but is not always consistently applied.<ref>{{citation|last=Fowler|first=Murray|title=The Segmental Phonemes of Sanskritized Tamil|journal=Language|Volume=30|number=3|pages=360-367}} at p. 360.</ref>

==Sounds==
{{main|Tamil phonology}}

Tamil phonology is characterised by the presence of [[retroflex consonant]]s, and strict rules for the distribution within words of voiced and unvoiced [[plosive]]s. Tamil phonology permits few consonant clusters, which can never be word initial. Native grammarians classify Tamil phonemes into vowels, consonants, and a "secondary character", the āytam.

===Vowels===
Tamil vowels are called ''{{IAST|uyireḻuttu}}'' (''uyir'' – life, ''{{IAST|eḻuttu}}'' – letter). The vowels are classified into short (''{{IAST|kuṟil}}'') and long (five of each type) and two [[diphthong]]s, /ai/ and /au/, and three "shortened" (''{{IAST|kuṟṟiyal}}'') vowels.

The long (''{{IAST|neṭil}}'') vowels are about twice as long as the short vowels. The [[diphthong]]s are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as the short vowels, though most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.

===Consonants===
Tamil [[consonants]] are known as ''{{IAST|meyyeḻuttu}}'' (''mey''—body, ''{{IAST|eḻuttu}}''—letters). The [[consonant]]s are classified into three categories with six in each category: ''{{IAST|valliṉam}}''—hard, ''{{IAST|melliṉam}}''—soft or [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]], and ''{{IAST|iṭayiṉam}}''—medium. 

Unlike most Indian languages, Tamil does not have [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants. In addition, the voicing of [[plosive]]s is governed by strict rules in ''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}''. Plosives are unvoiced if they occur word-initially or doubled. Elsewhere they are voiced, with a few becoming [[fricative]]s [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]]ally. [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]s and [[Approximant consonant|approximant]]s are always voiced.<ref>''See e.g.'' the pronunciation guidelines in G.U. Pope (1868). ''A Tamil hand-book, or, Full introduction to the common dialect of that language''. (3rd ed.). Madras, Higginbotham & Co.</ref>

Though many characters sound alike, the different tongue-teeth vocal coordinations, produce different sound tones. Many of the characters that sound alike are differenciated by a sizing or specific description. For instance the character ற and ர have the same pronounciation. Contrary to popular belief, ர is truly the bigger of the two constantants and is known as 'big ra' whereas ற is actually 'small ra'.

Phonemes in brackets are [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] equivalents. Both voiceless and voiced forms are represented by the same character in Tamil, and voicing is determined by context. The sounds {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/ʂ/}} are peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, being found only in loanwords and frequently replaced by native sounds. There are well-defined rules for [[elision]] in Tamil categorised into different classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision.

===Āytam===
Classical Tamil also had a phoneme called the ''[[Āytam]]'', written as ‘ஃ’. Tamil grammarians of the time classified it as a dependent phoneme (or restricted phoneme<ref name="krishnamurti">{{cite book | last = Krishnamurti | first = Bhadriraju | title = The Dravidian Languages | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | series = Cambridge Language Surveys | year = 2003 | isbn = 0521771110 | pages = 154}}</ref> ) (''{{IAST|cārpeḻuttu}}''), but it is very rare in modern Tamil. The rules of pronunciation given in the Tolkāppiyam, a text on the grammar of Classical Tamil, suggest that the ''āytam'' could have [[Glottal stop|glottalised]] the sounds it was combined with. It has also been suggested that the ''āytam'' was used to represent the [[Implosive consonant|voiced implosive]] (or closing part or the first half) of geminated voiced plosives inside a word.<ref>''See generally'' F. B. J. Kuiper, "Two problems of old Tamil phonology", ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 2:3 (September 1958) pp. 191-224, esp. pp. 191-207.</ref>

===Numerals & Symbols===
Apart from the usual numerals, Tamil also has numerals for 10, 100 and 1000. Symbols for day, month, year, debit, credit, as above, rupee, numeral are present as well.

==Grammar==
{{main|Tamil grammar}}

Much of Tamil [[grammar]] is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the ''[[Tolkāppiyam]]''.  Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar ''{{IAST|Naṉṉūl}}''  which restated and clarified the rules of the ''Tolkāppiyam'', with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ''{{IAST|eḻuttu}}'', ''col'', ''{{IAST|poruḷ}}'', ''yāppu'', ''{{IAST|aṇi}}''. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.<ref name=five_parts_grammar>{{cite web
  | url = http://www.southasia.upenn.edu/tamil/lit.html
  | title = "Five fold grammar of Tamil"
  | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}
</ref>

Similar to other Dravidian languages, Tamil is an [[agglutinative language]].<ref name="agglutinative_lang">{{cite web
| url = http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15434311laq0302_5?cookieSet=1&journalCode=laq
| title = "Tamil is an agglutinative language"
| accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> Tamil is characterised by its use of [[retroflex consonants]], like the other [[Dravidian languages]]. It also uses a liquid l (ழ) (example Tami'''l'''), which is also found in Malayalam (example Ko'''zh'''ikode), but disappeared from Kannada at around 1000 AD (but present in Unicode), and was never present in Telugu.<ref name="retroflex_consonants">{{cite web
| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=2Qwf3pAxJpUC&pg=PA40&ots=kqeR3TbYVk&dq=Tamil+retroflex+consonants&sig=xUZeNAJUhQOR6UMroReeMr0Kwtg#PPA40,M1
| title = "A Reference Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry: 150 B.C.-Pre-Fifth/Sixth Century A.D. By V. S. Rajam"
| accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> Tamil words consist of a [[lexeme|lexical root]] to which one or more [[affix]]es are attached. Most Tamil affixes are [[suffix]]es. Tamil suffixes can be ''[[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] suffixes'', which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or ''[[inflection]]al suffixes'', which mark categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of [[agglutination]], which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes.

===Morphology===

Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (''{{IAST|tiṇai}}'')—the "rational" (''{{IAST|uyartiṇai}}''), and the "irrational" (''{{IAST|aḵṟiṇai}}'')—which include a total of five classes (''pāl'', which literally means ‘gender’). [[Human]]s and [[deity|deities]] are classified as "rational", and all other nouns ([[animal]]s, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The "rational" nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes (''pāl'')—masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The "irrational" nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes - irrational singular and irrational plural. The ''pāl'' is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an [[honorific]], gender-neutral, singular form.<ref name="classes_of_nouns">{{cite web
  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=AfwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA156&dq=%22Classes+of+nouns+in+Tamil%22
  | title = "Classes of nouns in Tamil"
  | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref>

Suffixes are used to perform the functions of [[Grammatical case|case]]s or [[postposition]]s. Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in [[Sanskrit]]. These were the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[sociative case|sociative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[ablative case|ablative]]. Modern grammarians argue that this classification is artificial, and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case.<ref>Harold Schiffman, "Standardization and Restandardization: the case of Spoken Tamil." ''Language in Society'' 27:3 (1998) pp. 359-385 and esp. pp.374-375.</ref> Tamil nouns can take one of four [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es, ''i'', ''a'', ''u'' and ''e'' which are functionally equivalent to the demonstratives in [[English language|English]].

Tamil [[verb]]s are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of [[suffix]]es, which show person, number, mood, tense and voice.
*Person and number are indicated by [[suffix]]ing the [[oblique case]] of the relevant [[pronoun]]. The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from [[grammatical particle]]s, which are added to the stem.
*Tamil has two voices. The first indicates that the subject of the sentence ''undergoes'' or ''is the object of'' the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence ''directs'' the action referred to by the verb stem.
*Tamil has three simple tenses—past, present, and future—indicated by the suffixes, as well as a series of perfects indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same [[morpheme]]s which mark tense categories.  Tamil verbs also mark [[evidentiality]], through the addition of the hearsay [[clitic]] ''{{IAST|ām}}.''<ref name="steeverevidentiality">{{Citation | first=Sanford B. | last=Steever | editor-last=Güldemann | editor-first=Tom | editor2-last=von Roncador | editor2-first=Manfred | contribution=Direct and indirect discourse in Tamil | title=Reported Discourse: A Meeting Ground for Different Linguistic Domains | year=2002 | pages=91-108 | place=Amsterdam | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company   | isbn=9027229589}} at p. 105.</ref>

Traditional grammars of Tamil do not distinguish between [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s, including both of them under the category ''uriccol'', although modern grammarians tend to distinguish between them on morphological and syntactical grounds.<ref name="lehmann1989">{{cite book |last = Lehmann |first = Thomas |title = A Grammar of Modern Tamil |year= 1989 |publisher= Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture |location= Pondicherry}} at pp. 9-11 </ref> Tamil has a large number of [[ideophone]]s that act as adverbs indicating the way the object in a given state "says" or "sounds".<ref>{{cite book |author=Swiderski, Richard M. |title=The metamorphosis of English: versions of other languages |publisher=Bergin & Garvey |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=61 |isbn=0-89789-468-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Tamil has no [[article (grammar)|article]]s. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number "one" as an indefinite article, or by the context.<ref name="steeversummary">{{Citation | first = E. | last = Annamalai | first2= S.B. | last2 = Steever | editor-last = Steever | editor-first = Sanford B. | contribution = Modern Tamil | title = The Dravidian Languages | year = 1998 | pages = pp. 100-128 | place = London | publisher = Routledge | id =  ISBN 0415100232}} at p. 109.</ref> In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between [[Clusivity|inclusive]] pronouns நாம் ''{{IAST|nām}}'' (we), நமது ''{{IAST|namatu}}'' (our) that include the addressee and exclusive pronouns நாங்கள் ''{{IAST|nāṅkaḷ}}'' (we), எமது ''{{IAST|ematu}}'' (our) that do not.<ref name="steeversummary"/>

===Syntax===

Tamil is a consistently [[Branching (linguistics)|head-final]] language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with typical word order [[Subject Object Verb]] (SOV).<ref name="SOV_language">{{cite web
  | url = http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/schuh/lx001/Discussion/d02.html
  | title = "Tamil is a head-final language"
  | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> However, Tamil also exhibits extensive ''scrambling'' (word order variation), so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects. Tamil has [[postposition]]s rather than [[prepositions]]. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.

Tamil is a [[null subject language]]. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs and objects. It is possible to construct valid sentences that have only a verb—such as ''{{IAST|muṭintuviṭṭatu}}'' ("completed")—or only a subject and object, without a verb such as ''{{IAST|atu eṉ vīṭu}}'' ("That, my house"). Tamil does not have a [[copula]] (a linking verb equivalent to the word ''is''). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily.

==Vocabulary==
{{seealso|Wiktionary:Category:Tamil language|Wiktionary:Category:Tamil derivations|List of loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil}}

The vocabulary of Tamil is mainly Dravidian.  A strong sense of [[linguistic purism]] is found in Modern Tamil<ref>Sumathi Ramaswamy, En/Gendering Language: The Poetics of Tamil Identity" ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 35:4. (Oct. 1993), pp. 683-725.</ref>, which opposes the use of foreign loan-words.<ref>{{Harvnb|Krishnamurti|2003|p=480}}.</ref> Nonetheless, a number of words used in classical and modern Tamil indicate borrowing from languages of neighbouring groups, or with whom the Tamils had trading links, including [[Munda]] (e.g. {{IAST|tavaḷai}} "frog" from Munda {{IAST|tabeg}}), [[Malay]] (e.g. {{IAST|cavvarici}} "sago" from Malay {{IAST|sāgu}}), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (e.g. {{IAST|campān}} "skiff" from Chinese san-pan) and Greek (e.g. {{IAST|ora}} from Greek ὥρα).  In more modern times, Tamil has imported words from [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and [[Marathi]], reflecting groups that have ruled the Tamil area at various points of time, and from neighbouring languages such as [[Telugu]], [[Kannada]] and [[Sinhala]].  During the modern period, words have also been borrowed from European languages, such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Meenakshisundaram|1965|pp=169-193}}</ref>

The strongest impact of purism in Tamil has been on loanwords from Sanskrit.  During its history, Tamil, along with other Dravidian languages like [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam]] etc., was influenced by [[Sanskrit]] in terms of vocabulary, grammar and literary styles,<ref name="influence">"Literature in all Dravidian languages owes a great deal to Sanskrit, the magic wand whose touch raised each of the languages from a level of patois to that of a literary idiom" (Sastri 1955, p309); Trautmann, Thomas R. 2006.
