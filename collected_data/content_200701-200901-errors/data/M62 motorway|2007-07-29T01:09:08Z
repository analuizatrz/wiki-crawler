The '''M62 motorway''' is a west-east [[Pennines|transpennine]] route in northern [[England]], connecting the cities of [[Liverpool]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], passing the cities of  [[Warrington]], [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]], [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]]. The road also forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroutes]] [[European route E20|E20]] and [[European route E22|E22]].

Due to its high altitude (in fact, at [[Saddleworth Moor]], it reaches the highest point of any motorway in Britain, at 1442&nbsp;feet (440&nbsp;m) above [[sea level]]<ref name="mwdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m62/|title=M62 motorway|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>), efforts are made to keep the road clear of [[snow]] in winter months, when other cross-Pennine routes are often shut.

In [[2005]], the M62 had an average traffic flow of 95,000 vehicles per day east of the Pennines, and an average traffic flow of 77,000 vehicles west of the Pennines.<ref name="DFTstats">{{Citation

== History ==

===Origin of the road===
The origins of the M62 date back to the 1930s, where the need for a route between Lancashire and Yorkshire had been agreed after discussion by the respective highway authorities of the counties<ref name="mcr">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62ecclesbdy.htm|title=M62: Eccles to county boundary|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>. At the same time, it was envisaged that a route between Liverpool and Hull was also needed, connecting the two ports to industrial Yorkshire.<ref name="wry">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62master.htm|title=M62 in West Yorkshire|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

Some years later, after the [[World War II|war]], the Minister of Transport appointed engineers to inspect road standards between the [[A580 road]] in [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]] and the [[A1 road]] near [[Selby]]<ref name="wry" />. In 1949, that year's Road Plan for South Lancashire specified the need for the [[dual carriageway|dualling]] and [[grade separation]] of the [[A580 road]], and bypasses of both [[Huyton]] and [[Cadishead]]<ref name="mersey">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62queeccles.htm|title=M62: Queens Drive to Eccles|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>. However, by the 1960s, this was considered inadequate, and there was "an urgent need" to link Liverpool to the motorway network<ref name="mersey" />, similar to the motorway line laid down in [[West Yorkshire]] several years previously.<ref name="wry" /> When James Drake visited the USA in 1962, his experience with the [[Interstate Highway  system]] led him to conclude that the "Merseyside Expressway", as it was then known, would need extending to [[M63 motorway|Stretford-Eccles Bypass]]. While initially the plan was unpopular and unsupported by the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]], the scheme was added to Road Plan in 1963.<ref name="mersey" />

===Construction west of Manchester===
Originally, the section of the M62 west of Manchester was intended to be a separate motorway linking Liverpool with Salford, but a continuous motorway between Leeds and Liverpool was deemed to be more feasible<ref name="pathetic_m52" /><ref name="m602_cbrd">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m602/|title=M602 Motorway|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>, known as the '''M52'''. Construction of the motorway between Liverpool and Manchester started in 1971, with the construction of a link between the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and the [[M6 motorway]]<ref name="mersey" />. Concurrently, a contract to link the M6 with Manchester was under way, which required the removal of unsuitable material and drainage of the land. The motorway was completed in August 1974, creating a continuous link between Yorkshire and Tarbock.

The section between Tarbock and Liverpool was the last section of the motorway to be completed, in 1976, due to the difficulties of building an urban motorway. In total, two viaducts, ten bridges and seven underpasses had to be constructed to secure the structural integrity of the surrounding residential area. The motorway, however, reached only as far as Queen's Drive (Junction 4), leaving the first three junctions unbuilt.<ref name="mersey" />

===Construction in Greater Manchester===
[[Image:M62 near Irlam, Salford.jpg|thumb|left|The M62 near [[Irlam]], the original eastern terminus, in the [[blue hour|early hours of the morning.]]]]
{{seealso|M60 motorway}}
{{seealso|M63 motorway}}
{{seealso|M602 motorway}}
The first part of the M62 to be built was the Stretford-Eccles Bypass, which now covers junctions 7 to 13 of the [[M60 motorway|M60]]<ref name="pathetic_stretford">{{cite web|title=M62 Stretford-Eccles Bypass|url=http://pathetic.org.uk/lost/m62/|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=Pathetic Motorways}}</ref>. Construction started in 1957, and opened in 1960.<ref name="seb">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m63stretecc.htm|title=M63 (now M60) Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Carrington Spur|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref>

Originally, two separate motorways were planned: one, the M52, would travel from [[Liverpool]] into [[Salford]]; the other, the M62, would link Pole Moor with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass.<ref name="pathetic_m52">{{cite web|url=http://pathetic.org.uk/lost/m52/|title=M52 Liverpool to Manchester|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=Pathetic Motorways}}</ref>. The section between the interchange with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Salford is now occupied by the [[M602 motorway]].

The Eccles-Pole Moor section was opened in 1971 <ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m62/timeline.shtml|title=M62 - Timeline|publisher=CBRD|work=Motorway Database|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref><ref name="cbrd_m60_timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m60/timeline.shtml|title=M60 - Timeline|publisher=CBRD|work=Motorway Database|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>. Of this, the first section to be built was a one-mile extension of the Stretford-Eccles Bypass to [[Worsley]]. Between Eccles and Pole Moor, sixty-seven crossings of the motorway were required, including seven viaducts and eight junctions.<ref name="mcr" />

===Construction between Saddleworth and Lofthouse===
[[Image:M62 motorway, Calderdale.jpg|thumb|left|The M62 passes [[Scammonden Water]] in [[West Yorkshire]].]]
The first section of the Yorkshire section of the motorway was completed in 1970, between the county boundary on [[Saddleworth Moor]] and [[Outlane]].<ref name="mwdb" /><ref name="polemoor">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62bounpole.htm|title=M62: Boundary to Pole Moor|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref> The construction of the section between Saddleworth and Pole Moor was a difficult task, given the inhospitable terrain, numerous peat bogs, and undesirable weather conditions. To build this section of motorway, twelve million cubic yards of material was moved, eight million of which were solid rock. 650,000 cubic yards of this material was [[peat]], which had to be cut from the [[rock strata]] and was eventually deposited on hillsides adjacent to the motorway. In addition to the problems caused by removal of the material, the geology of the moors resulted in the engineers needing to split the carriageways for three-quarters of a mile in the middle of this section, sparing Stott Hall Farm from demolition (and not due to the owner's refusal to sell the land, as commonly believed<ref name="polemoor" /><ref name="bbc_fastlane">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/02/02/020207_insideout_farmhouse_feature.shtml|title=Farming in the fast lane|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2007-02-02]]|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>). Two notable bridge constructions were the bridge carrying the [[Pennine Way]], which is curved downwards with 85 foot long cantilevers, and Scammonden Bridge, the longest single-span non-suspension bridge in Britain<ref name="cbrd-simluator">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62w-25|accessdate=2007-05-30|title=M62|work=Motorway Simulator|publisher=CBRD}}</ref>, which carries a [[B road]] 120 feet above the motorway.<ref name="polemoor" /> The mile-long section between Pole Moor and Outlane suffered fewer problems, with the summer weather being satisfactory.<ref name="pmtool">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62poleoutl.htm|title=M62: Pole Moor to Outlane|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref> Concurrently, a section of the motorway was being built between [[Gildersome]] and [[Lofthouse]]<ref name="mwdb" />, resulting in the demolition of a significant proportion of the village of [[Tingley]] to build the eponymous interchange.

===Construction between the M1 and the A1===
Two contracts were awarded for the section of the M62 between Lofthouse and Ferrybridge in 1972, and both were completed in 1974.<ref name="archive_2931">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62lofthope.htm|title=M62: Lofthouse to Hopetown|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref><ref name="archive_3133">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62hopeferry.htm|title=M62: Hopetown to Ferrybridge|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> On the first contract, care was needed at the crossing of the [[River Calder]] due to the [[alluvial]] bedrock, while, on the second, precautions were taken as the length was built on old [[coal mining|coal mine]] workings.

===Construction east of Ferrybridge===
[[Image:Ouse bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]] bridge, from the floodplain adjacent to the river.]]
The sections between Ferrybridge and North Cave were of the last sections of the motorway to be built.<ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline" /> One of the most notable features is the bridge crossing the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] west of Goole, a structure nearly one mile long, rising to thirty meters above ground level, which commenced construction in January 1973. The bridge was delayed due to "steel supplies [being] a chronic headache"<ref name="nce">{{Citation|last = Hayward|first = David|newspaper = New Civil Engineer|date = [[1975-08-14]]}}</ref> and a partial collapse of the framework, caused by bolts joining a cross-beam to a trestle shearing.<ref name="archive_ouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62goolouse.htm|title=M62: Goole - Ouse Bridge|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> The problems with the Ouse Bridge pushed the opening of the whole section east of [[Goole]] back to May 1976.<ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline" /><ref name="archive_ouse" />

===Coach bombing===
{{main|M62 coach bombing}}
On [[4 February]] [[1974]], a bomb was detonated on a coach containing off duty [[British Army|army personnel]] and family members,  between Chain Bar (Junction 26) and Gildersome (Junction 27), resulting in the deaths of 12 people and injuries in 38 other people. The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] were deemed responsible for the attacks.<ref name="coach">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,634024,0.html|title=Miscarriages of justice|date=[[2002-01-15]]|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=''[[Guardian Unlimited]]''}}</ref>

===Rail crash===
{{main|Selby rail crash}}
On [[28 February]] [[2001]], at 06:13 [[GMT]], Gary Hart, a [[sleep deprivation|sleep-deprived]] driver, swerved off the M62 onto the [[East Coast Main Line]] near [[Selby]]. While Hart was calling the [[emergency services]], a [[GNER]] southbound train collided with Hart's [[Land Rover]], and subsequently derailed into the path of an oncoming [[freight train]]. 10 people, including the train drivers, were killed, and a further 82 were injured.

===Development after opening===

[[Image:A1(M) and M62 interchange.jpg|thumb|left|Junction 32a during construction.]]
The section of the M62 between Eccles Intetchange and Simister Interchange (junctions 12 to 18) was renamed to the [[M60 motorway|M60]] in 2000.<ref name="cbrd_m60">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m60/|title=M60|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

In January 2006, Junction 32a was opened, an interchange between the M62 and the recently upgraded [[A1 road|A1(M)]].<ref name="hwa_newsletter">{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/n050282_F_HM_NEWSLETTER.pdf|title=A1(M) Ferrybridge to Hook Moor open to Traffic - January 2006|publisher=[[Highways Agency]]|date=2005|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

In 2007, the UK's first [[High occupancy vehicle lane|car-sharing lane]] on a motorway is to be opened at Junction 26, allowing any eastbound traffic from the [[M606 motorway|M606]] with more than one occupant to use the lane.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/4822808.stm|title=First car-share lane to be built|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2006-03-20]]|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

There are also plans to widen the motorway to four lanes between Junctions 25 and 28, as part of a project to reduce congestion in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/10575.aspx|title=M1 and M62 Motorway Improvements in Yorkshire|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

==References in popular culture==

The road was mentioned in the song "Driving Away From Home (Jim's Tune)" by [[It's Immaterial]] in 1986, a song which used the motorway as a way of getting to Manchester from the band's hometown of Liverpool. The road was then referenced, five years later, in "[[It's Grim Up North]]", by [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]]. This song consisted of a list of towns and cities on and near the M62 in the "grim North", in addition to the motorway itself. The M62 is also given a mention in "The Snake", a song from the album ''[[Secrets (Human League album)|Secrets]]'' by [[The Human League]], as an alternative route to [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] from the [[Snake Pass]], the main subject of the song. The song also suggests the [[A628 road|A628]] as another alternative to the route, and "M62 Song" is a song by English [[indie rock]] band [[Doves]] from the album ''[[The Last Broadcast]]''.
