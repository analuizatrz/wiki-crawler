The album is considered by many as their darkest. Most of this is true because here the group replaces their signature ska sound, which has always been colorful and giddy, by the artsy detachment of new wave, inspired by such bands like [[Split Enz]] and especially [[Missing Persons]]. Gwen Stefani's self-deprecating lyrical sense in this album also grabbed the attention of critics, who poked her about writing on such things like insecurity, marriage and settling down. The album, which leant on the retro-smart production sense of Glen Ballard, was very celebrated and acclaimed, even though it slid down the charts (after a very good start) and only got one major hit ("Simple Kind of Life"), while "Ex-Girlfriend", "Bathwater", and "New" largely failed to reach expectations. "Magic's in the Makeup" was originally intended to be the fourth and final single.
The album debuted at number two in the [[Billboard 200]] with sales over 200,000 copies, it spent three weeks inside the top 10 and 46 consecutive weeks inside the chart.

The album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[2001]] [[Grammy Awards]].

===Title===
The title of the album comes from the 30-year period [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] takes to revolve around the sun, and which refers to the maturity and self evaluation people supposedly encounter at that period of their lives; this is often formally called '[[Saturn return|The Saturn Return]]' by [[astrologers]] and others and has been known about since the time of the ancient Greeks. Specifically the album was named so because Gwen Stefani's 30th birthday was occurring. It also matches with the album's themes of independence and confusion.

==Critical reception==
The album was well-received by critics.  [[All Music Guide]] gave it four and a half stars, calling it "a terrific, layered record that exceeds any expectations set by ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]''".[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:5tf6zf01ehak~T1]  Barry Walters of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to it as "a superstar follow-up that not only betters its predecessor but also radically departs from it".[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nodoubt/albums/album/229542/review/5944400/return_of_saturn]
