'''Phil Brooks'''<ref name"philbrooks">{{cite web|url=http://members5.boardhost.com/wrestlingnews/msg/67.html|title=CM PUNK... part 6|accessdate=2006-09-26|author=Lagatolla, Al|date=2001-05-29}}</ref> (born [[October 26]] [[1978]]),<ref name="nndb"/> better known by his [[ring name]] '''CM Punk''', is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently signed to [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) on its [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]], where he holds the [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank contract]].

Punk initially came to prominence through his career on the professional wrestling [[independent circuit]], primarily as a member of the [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) roster where he was an [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Champion]], [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]], and the first head trainer of the [[Ring of Honor#ROH wrestling school|ROH wrestling school]]. Along with [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Nelson Erazo|Homicide]], he was considered to be one of the three icons of ROH.<ref name="cruise">Originally a journal entry by [[Bobby Cruise]] for Ring of Honor available at ROHwrestling.com but the website has undergone a large maintenance and the journal entry was lost in the process. The relevant text was "''I have heard people refer to ROH having three icons in Punk, Samoa Joe and Homicide. You could not have someone say Ring of Honor and not think of those three guys. Now, one of those icons is gone.''"</ref> 

Punk later accepted a contract from WWE and spent a year in their developmental promotion [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) during which time he won every championship in the promotion. When the ECW brand was revived in 2006 Punk was brought into the brand's roster where he had several successes including being undefeated in singles competition for the six months after his debut and ultimately winning the [[ECW Championship]] in September 2007.

Throughout his career, Punk has consistently used the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of being [[straight edge]], a lifestyle he follows in real life.<ref name="punkshoot">{{cite video|people=CM Punk|url= http://www.rfvideo.com/browseproducts/Shoot-with-CM-Punk.html|title=Shoot with CM Punk|medium=DVD|publisher=RF Video|date = November|year=2003|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> Depending on [[List of professional wrestling slang#A|alignment]] as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], [[#Gimmick|different aspects]] of the culture are emphasized to encourage the desired audience [[Heat (professional wrestling)|reaction]].<ref name="punkshoot" />

==Career==
===Early career===
Punk's first venture into wrestling was a stint in a [[backyard wrestling]] federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the [[ring name]] CM Punk when he was put into a [[tag team]] named the Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="chickmagnets">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040222144349/http://www.chicagowrestling.com/AL/al-cmvenom-12-17-01.htm|title=CM Venom Interview|accessdate=2006-09-26|author=Lagattolla, Al|date=2001-12-17|publisher=Chicago Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="jon">{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/748/748635p1.html|title=CM Punk Interview|accessdate=2007-03-19|author=Robinson, Jon|date=2006-12-01|publisher=IGN}}</ref> Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely wanted to be a wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun.<ref name="punkshoot" /> After leaving the federation, he enrolled as a student at the "Steel Domain" [[wrestling school]] in Chicago, where he was trained by [[Ace Steel]],<ref name="acesteel" /> Danny Dominion and Kevin Quinn to become a professional wrestler. As part of the training, he wrestled at [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul's]] Steel Domain Wrestling.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick">{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclothesline.com/Wojcik-Punk.htm|title=Wojick Interview|accessdate=2006-09-26|author=Wojick, Alan|date=2003-06-21|publisher=The Wrestling Clothesline}}</ref> It was in the Steel Domain that he met Scott Colton,<ref name="punkcabana" /><ref name="joepunk">{{cite video|people=CM Punk; [[Samoa Joe]]|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=200&id=1220|title=Straight Shootin' with Samoa Joe & CM Punk|medium=DVD|publisher=Ring of Honor|date=2005-03-10|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> who soon adopted the stage name [[Colt Cabana]]. Punk and Cabana became best friends and spent most of their early career together working in the same [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]], as opponents or allies.<ref name="punkcabana">{{cite video|people=CM Punk; Colt Cabana|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=200&id=1397|title=Straight Shootin' with CM Punk & Colt Cabana|medium=DVD|publisher=Ring of Honor|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> In the independents Punk, along with fellow Steel Domain graduates Colt Cabana, Chuckie Smoothe, [[Adam Pearce]] and manager [[Dave Prazak]], formed a [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] named the Gold Bond Mafia.<ref name="punkshoot" /> The Gold Bond Mafia (CM Punk, Colt Cabana and [[Chris Hero]]) wrestled The Black T-Shirt Squad ([[Mike Quackenbush]], Reckless Youth and Don Montoya) in the main event of [[Chikara Pro Wrestling|CHIKARA]]'s debut show. The BTS won after Reckless pinned Cabana following a Northern Light's Bomb 2k4.

Punk's home promotion for his early career is usually considered to be [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South|Independent Wrestling Association: Mid-South]] (IWA:Mid-South).<ref name="punkshoot" /> During Punk's time in IWA:Mid-South he had high profile feuds with Colt Cabana and [[Chris Hero]] while also rising to the top of the roster winning the [[IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship]] twice and the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] on five separate occasions. Notably his feud with Hero included a 55-minute [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]],<ref name="punkshoot" /> a 93-minute [[two out of three falls match]]<ref 
name="wojick" /> and several 60-minute draws.<ref name="joepunk" /> Punk's matches with Cabana led him to being hired by the [[Ring of Honor]] promotion.<ref name="wojick" /> During his time in IWA:Mid-South he would also meet, wrestle against and become a friend of [[Eddie Guerrero]].<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick" /> From February 2003 until May 2004 Punk refused to wrestle for IWA:Mid-South. Punk claims that this was in protest to [[Ian Rotten]]'s treatment of Chris Hero;<ref name="punkshoot" /> however Hero himself has stated he believes there were other reasons and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company.<ref name="heroshoot">{{cite video|people=[[Chris Hero]]|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=2708|title=Shoot with Chris Hero|medium=DVD|publisher=RF Video|year =2005|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> Eventually Punk returned to IWA:Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until 2005 when he was signed to World Wrestling Entertainment. His last appearance in IWA:Mid-South was on [[July 2]] [[2005]] in which he competed in a sixty-minute time limit draw against [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]].

===Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===
Punk joined [[Ring of Honor]] initially as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], but was quickly [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in a feud with [[Scott Levy|Raven]] that featured numerous variants of [[List of professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification matches]]. At the same time Punk joined the wrestling promotion [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA Total Nonstop Action]] (TNA), where he was paired with [[Brian Wohl|Julio Dinero]] as, ironically, members of Raven's TNA [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] [[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]].

Punk started climbing the ranks of ROH with notable achievements including coming second at the ''Second Anniversary'' show during the tournament to crown the first [[ROH Pure Championship|ROH Pure Champion]], losing to [[A.J. Styles]] in the finals, and winning the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Championship]] twice with Colt Cabana as the [[Second City Saints]], both times defeating the [[Briscoe Brothers]] to win the championship. Circa October 2003 Punk was hired as the first head trainer of the [[Ring of Honor#ROH wrestling school|Ring of Honor wrestling school]],<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="slamcanoe">{{cite web| url = http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/06/06/1073740.html| title = CM Punk mulls over his future|accessdate =2007-04-17| author = Hillhouse, Dave| date = 2005-06-06| publisher = SLAM!

[[Image:Punkindependent.jpg|thumb|left|CM Punk in a match against Danny Dominion at an [[NWA Midwest]] event.]]
Meanwhile in TNA on [[February 25]] [[2004]] Punk had a physical scuffle with [[Teddy Hart]] that was broken up by [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] outside of a restaurant shortly before a TNA show stemming from an ROH show in which Hart performed [[Teddy Hart#Ring of Honor|three unplanned spots]] putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury.<ref name="teddyhartlj">{{cite web|url=http://cmpunk.livejournal.com/2003/11/12/|title=My turn...|accessdate=13 July|accessyear=2007|author=CM Punk|date=2003-11-12|publisher=LiveJournal}}</ref><ref name="shootteddyhart">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=15350|title=Derek Burgan reviews Best of Teddy Hart & Jack Evans|accessdate=2007-06-13|author=Burgan, Derek|date=2006-01-28|format=asp|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|quote=The interviewer immediately asked Teddy about the situation with CM Punk.

Sports}}</ref>

In ROH Punk faced off against [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] for the championship in a three match series. The first match, on [[June 12]] [[2004]] at ''World Title Classic'' in [[Dayton, Ohio]], resulted in a 60 minute time-limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe could pin or cause the other to submit in the sixty minutes. The second match between Samoa Joe and CM Punk was planned to have occurred on [[December 4]] [[2004]]. However, because [[Steve Corino]] was pulled from a match with Samoa Joe by [[Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX|Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE]] the second match was hastily rescheduled on [[October 11]] [[2004]] for [[October 16]] in Punk's hometown of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name="joepunk" /> At ''Joe vs. Punk II'' on [[October 16]] they wrestled to a second 60 minute draw. In addition to becoming Ring of Honor's best selling DVD at that point, the match received the first 5-star rating by [[Dave Meltzer]]'s ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' for a match in North America since 1997.<ref name="joepunk" /> Joe ended the series by defeating Punk in the third and final match on [[December 4]] [[2004]] at ''All-Star Extravaganza 2'' in which there was a no time limit stipulation.

In June 2005, Punk accepted a deal with [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], after a try-out match against [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]] on its ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night HEAT]]'' show. Even though he had accepted the deal, Punk went on to defeat [[Austin Aries]] to win the [[ROH World Championship]] on [[June 18]] [[2005]] at ''Death Before Dishonor III'' with the [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pepsi Plunge]].

Immediately after the match Punk proceeded to [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turn]] heel and started an angle where he threatened to bring the ROH World Championship to WWE with him. For weeks, Punk teased the ROH locker room and the ROH fans as well as mocking the championship he possessed, going so far as to sign his WWE contract on it. A notable part of this angle was [[Mick Foley]] making several ROH appearances, attempting to convince Punk to do the right thing and defend the title on his way out.

On [[August 12]] [[2005]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] Punk lost the ROH World Championship to [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]] in a four corner elimination match consisting of himself, Gibson, [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Christopher Daniels]], who re-debuted after a year and half long absence. Gibson countered Punk's Pepsi Plunge with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|Super]] [[Powerbomb#Double underhook powerbomb|Tiger Bomb]]. His final scheduled match in Ring of Honor took place at ''Punk: The Final Chapter'' on [[August 13]] [[2005]] against long-time friend Colt Cabana in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#two out of three falls|2 out of 3 falls match]], which he lost. In his last match, he was visibly crying, and was showered with streamers when he posed in the middle of the ring.

Punk made a special appearance at the ROH show ''Unscripted II'' on [[February 11]] [[2006]], when the original card had to be scrapped due to [[Brandon Silvestry|Low Ki]] leaving ROH the week prior along with most of the ROH roster contracted to TNA being pulled from the show due to a snowstorm that TNA officials thought might prevent performers from reaching [[TNA Against All Odds#2006|a pay-per-view]] scheduled the next day.<ref name"unscripted1">{{cite web

====Ohio Valley Wrestling====
Punk was assigned to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], a WWE developmental territory. On [[September 26]] [[2005]] in his OVW television debut, Punk suffered a ruptured eardrum and broken nose at the hands of Danny Inferno, after he was hit by an [[Botch (professional wrestling)|overly]] [[Stiff (professional wrestling)|stiff]] [[Punch (strike)|right hand]]. Despite the injury, Punk finished the match and quickly recovered.<ref name="ovwresults05">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/2005.html|title=Ohio Valley Wrestling - 2005 Results|accessdate=2006-07-30|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="lordsofpaininjury">{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2005_/articles/1126805425.php|title=Latest on released WWE wrestler, Ken Kennedy, CM Punk injury|accessdate=2006-09-26|author=Cantor, Brian|date=2005-09-15|format=php|publisher=Lords of Pain}}</ref>

On [[November 9]] [[2005]], Punk became the [[OVW Television Championship|OVW Television Champion]] after defeating [[Ken Doane]].<ref name="ovwresults05"/> This led immediately to a feud between Punk and [[Brent Albright]], who had previously been feuding with Doane for the television championship and had lost his chance to wrestle Doane after Punk had hit him with a chair so he himself could wrestle Doane. This led to a series of matches, including one which ended in overtime with Albright having Punk submit to Albright's finisher, the [[Professional wrestling holds#Fujiwara armbar|Crowbar]], however Punk was able to keep the championship as he had not agreed to the extra time.<ref name="ovwresults05"/> On [[January 4]] [[2006]], Punk lost the OVW Television Championship during a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three way dance]] between himself, Albright and Doane. Doane was injured halfway through the match and could not continue and was replaced by [[Aaron Stevens (wrestler)|Aaron "The Idol" Stevens]]. Punk submitted to Albright's Crowbar and was eliminated but after interference by Punk, Stevens was able to get the [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pin]] on Albright to become the new OVW Television Champion.<ref name="ovwresults06">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/2006.html|title=Ohio Valley Wrestling - 2006 Results|accessdate=2006-07-30|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> The feud continued after a short period in which Albright and Punk were a tag team, but they became opponents again after Albright wanted the respect of Punk who would never give it to him and instead proceeded to "punk out" (get the better of) Albright repeatedly. This continued for weeks with Punk always getting the better of Albright until a double turn occurred on [[February 1]] [[2006]] when Albright turned heel during a tag match allowing [[Spirit Squad|The Spirit Squad]] to beat Punk and, in doing so, turning Punk face.<ref name="ovwresults06"/>

During this time CM Punk had a minor appearance at [[WrestleMania 22]] on [[April 2]] [[2006]] as one of the [[gangster]]s who rode a 1930s era car to the ring before [[John Cena]]'s entrance.<ref name="wmgangster">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/pictures/c/cmpunk/19.jpg|title = 19.jpg|accessdate=2006-09-26|date=2006-04-02|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|quote=CM Punk as a gangster during [[John Cena]]'s entrance}}</ref>

When [[Matt Cappotelli]] vacated the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]] due to a brain tumor, a tournament was held to crown a new champion. The finals were Brent Albright vs CM Punk with Albright defeating Punk to become the new champion.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> Punk and Albright continued their feud with Albright becoming more and more unstable and paranoid about maintaining his championship after several close call matches against Punk, resulting in acts such as threatening [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]]. On [[May 3]] [[2006]], Punk finally defeated Brent Albright in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Texas Bullrope Match|strap match]] to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> As champion, Punk retained the title in matches against opponents such as [[Shad Gaspard]],<ref name="ovwresults06"/> [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Ken Kennedy]],<ref name="ovwresults06"/> [[Johnny Jeter]],<ref name="ovwresults06"/> and [[Mike Mizanin|Mike "The Miz" Mizanin]].<ref name="punkvsmiz">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070629175121/http://pwtorch.com/artman/publish/article_17333.shtml|title=7/15 OVW in Cordyon, Ind.: C.M.

On [[July 28]] [[2006]] Punk and [[Seth Skyfire]] defeated [[Cryme Tyme|Shad Gaspard and the Neighborhoodie]] to win the [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship]] at a [[house show]].<ref name="sixflags">{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/ovw/sixflags.html#072806|title=Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom drawing 500|accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006|author=Pro Wrestling History|date=2006-07-28|work=Ohio Valley Wrestling Six Flag Shows}}</ref> With the victory Punk became the second OVW wrestler to have held each of the promotion's three championships, following Brent Albright, and along with Skyfire the first to hold two championships simultaneously. They would lose the Tag Team Championship on [[August 2]] [[2006]] to [[Jimmy Reiher, Jr.|Deuce Shade]] and [[Cliff Compton|"Domino" Cliff Compton]] after an injured Skyfire tagged in an already injured Punk.<ref name="ovwresults06"/>

This led to a feud between Punk and Skyfire after a rematch for the Tag Team Championship on [[August 7]] [[2006]] in which a healthy Punk purposefully tagged in an injured Skyfire to be beaten by Shade and Compton.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> On [[August 30]] [[2006]] a match was scheduled to take place between Punk and Skyfire for the OVW Heavyweight Championship. However, prior to the match Skyfire was attacked by Charles "The Hammer" Evans, who Skyfire had also been feuding with, and was replaced in the match by Chet Jablonski (Chet the Jet) who pinned Punk to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> As Punk no longer possessed the championship OVW no longer required him. He was removed from the roster and brought up to the WWE roster full time. He continues to make sporadic appearances for the company such as at the 400th episode of OVW on television.<ref name="ovwresults06"/>

Due to the [[WWE Brand Extension#June 2007 (Draft Lottery)|drafting]] of [[ECW Championship|ECW World Champion]] [[Bobby Lashley]] to ''RAW'' the ECW World Championship was declared vacant and a mini-tournament was announced to declare a new champion between Punk, Elijah Burke, [[Monty Brown|Marcus Cor Von]] and the recently drafted [[Chris Benoit]].

==Gimmick==
Punk has adopted his real-life following of the [[straight edge]] movement as his professional wrestling [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], but the gimmick uses different elements of Punk's personality and the beliefs of the straight edge movement depending on his [[List of professional wrestling slang#A|alignment]]. While portraying a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]], the gimmick tends to be that of Punk's normal personality,<ref name="punkshoot" /> largely indifferent to others who drink [[alcohol]], smoke [[tobacco]], partake in [[recreational drug use]] or have [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], but emphasizing the social discipline involved with [[abstinence]]. Conversely, his [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] personality tends to be that of one who is [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline]], exemplifying the elitist attitudes and superiority complexes - defined by Punk's common mantra during heel [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promos]] that, because he is straight edge, he is "better than you".<ref name="punkshoot" /> Regardless of alignment, Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written on the back of his hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape.

A common question about Punk's gimmick, and one that comes up often with fans, is the meaning of the [[initialism]] CM. Originally the CM represented the phrase "Chick Magnet", the name of the tag team he was in as a [[backyard wrestler]],<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="jon" /> however Punk would later change CM into an [[pseudo-acronym|orphan acronym]], declaring that it has no meaning.<ref name="wojick" /> Although Punk has stated CM now has no  real meaning he has taken to making up meanings when asked that fit the initials, going so far as to make up long stories to explain the origins that  do not match the actual origin story at all.<ref name="wojick" /> Since beginning this practice Punk has stated CM stands for "[[Cookie Monster]]",<ref name="The Mississauga News">{{cite web|url=http://mississauganews.com/article/8991|title=Sport Heroes takes on AIDS|publisher=The Mississauga News}}</ref><ref name="WWEuncut">{{cite web

An integral part of Punk's gimmick is that of the numerous [[tattoo]]s that adorn his body, some of which have come to become symbols associated with Punk as well as [[mantra]]s and declarations that have been integrated into his gimmick. The tattoos as a whole, due to their large quantity and variety, have also become an attribute identifiable to Punk. The most important of the individual tattoos in Punk's character, whether through association, symbol, or mantra, are: 
*A [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]] logo on his left shoulder which inspired the names of two of his [[#In wrestling|signature moves]] which also became a symbol of Punk himself, wearing the logo on his ring gear in the independent circuit as well as a slightly modified Pepsi logo being used as part of his [[Jumbotron|TitanTron]] entrance video.<ref name="tron">{{cite video|people=CM Punk|year=2006|title=Entrance video|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/tvshows/ecw/entrance_videos/0724cmpunkentvid|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> He got the tattoo as a joke, as many [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] members in his school were getting beer logos tattooed on their body, so Punk, a keen Pepsi drinker, chose to receive a Pepsi tattoo to emphasize his straight edge beliefs.<ref name="wojick" /> The tattoo is also a reference to former [[Minor Threat]] guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], who had a [[Coca-Cola]] tattoo and explained this by saying "I like Coca-Cola". When people inquire about Punk's Pepsi tattoo, he often replies "I like Pepsi" in a similar fashion.<ref name="punkshoot" />
*The words "[[Straight Edge]]" are spelled out on his stomach. This tattoo is one of Punk's oldest tattoos<ref name="wwemag">{{cite journal|author=CM Punk|year=2006|month=October|title=The Illustrated Man|journal=WWE Magazine|pages=13}}</ref> and has been referred to by Punk as his identity.<ref name="cheesegrater">{{cite video | people = CM Punk | url = http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=&id=1125&pRange=0&iCurrentPage=1 |title = Best Of American Super Juniors Tournament|medium = DVD|publisher = Ring of Honor|date =2005-04-02|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>
*A [[sleeve tattoo]] on his left arm entitled "luck is for losers", a mantra used on some of the choices for Punk's first [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] [[T-shirt]],<ref name="shirt">{{cite web|url=http://punk-wrestling.com/coppermine/thumbnails.php?album=1|title=ECW T-Shirt Designs|accessmonthday=2 October|accessyear=2006|format=php|publisher=Punk-Wrestling}}</ref> that features numerous symbols of [[good luck]] including a [[rabbit's foot]], [[four-leaf clover]] and a [[horseshoe]].<ref name="wweink">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/superstarink/articles/cmpunk|title=Punk's got a lucky arm|accessdate=2007-10-18|date=2007-10-18|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The tattoo also features four [[ace]] playing cards as a tribute to trainer [[Ace Steel]].<ref name="wweink" />
*His knuckles spell out "DRUG FREE" when placed together, "DRUG" on the right knuckles and "FREE" on the left. This tattoo is often used in wrestling as a taunting gesture to the crowd and opponents.
*A tattoo of [[Cobra Organization|the COBRA logo]] is on his right shoulder. On his right arm is the emblem of the [[Arashikage]] Ninja Clan.
*A tattoo on the back of his left hand reading "No gimmicks needed".<ref name="PS155">{{Citation| last=Martin| first=Fin| title=What's Going Down..| newspaper=[[Power Slam]]| issue=155| pages=4| year=2007| date=June 2007}}</ref>
Punk's character and gimmick have been parodied by the wrestling federation [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|CHIKARA]] with the character [[Necro Butcher|CP Munk]], the straight edge [[chipmunk]]. The character is simply a chipmunk [[mascot]] costume which includes references to Punk such as X marked wrist tape, a Pepsi logo on the costume's left shoulder, and a high-pitch version of Punk's best-known independent circuit theme song ''Miseria Cantare - The Beginning'', as performed by the band [[AFI (band)|AFI]].<ref name="cpmunk2">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070629175121/http://pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/15028|title=Tape review: Chikara, "Negative Balance," Aug. 13, w/Hero-Kingston, Claudio-Quack, Cannon-Reckless|accessdate=2006-10-16|author=Vetter, Chris|date=2005-10-04|format=cgi|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|quote=CP Munk is a wrestler in a chipmunk costume, like a school mascot outfit.
