[[Malay titles#State Titles|Dato' Seri]] '''Anwar bin Ibrahim''' (born [[August 10]], [[1947]]) is a former deputy prime minister and finance minister of [[Malaysia]]. Early in his career, he became a protégé of the former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|prime minister]] of Malaysia, [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], but subsequently emerged as the most prominent critic of Mahathir's administration. 

In 1999, he was sentenced in a highly controversial trial to six years in prison for [[Political corruption|corruption]], and in 2000, to another nine years for alleged homosexual acts. However, in 2004, Malaysia's highest court, the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] reversed the second conviction and he was released.

Anwar is the only Malaysian to ever make it into [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine's [[Time 100|100 most influential people]] in the world<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1733748_1733757_1735709,00.html Time 100 list for 2008] May 2, 2008, ''Time Magazine'' </ref>. He is also one of the signatories of [[A Common Word Between Us and You]], an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders, calling for peace and understanding.


==Early years==

Anwar was born in [[Cherok Tok Kun, Penang|Cherok Tok Kun]], a village on the mainland side of the northern Malaysian state of [[Penang]], to a hospital porter, Ibrahim Abdul Rahman (later to join politics and retire as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Health) and Che Yan, a housewife (and later UMNO politician). He was educated at University of Malaya, where he read Malay Studies. Prior to that, he took his secondary education at the [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]].

From 1968 to 1971, as a student, Anwar was the president of a [[Muslim]] students organisation, Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia (PKPIM). He was one of the protem committee of Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM) or Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia which was founded in 1971. He was also elected President of the Malaysian Youth Council or Majlis Belia Malaysia (MBM). In 1974, Anwar was arrested during student protests against rural poverty and hunger. He was imprisoned under the [[Internal Security Act of Malaysia|Internal Security Act]], which allows for detention without trial, and spent twenty months in the [[Kamunting Detention Center]] for political prisoners.

==Groomed for leadership==
In 1968-1971, he was first groomed in the National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students (Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia, PKPIM) as the president of the Union. He was very well known as one of the most prominent student movement leaders. In 1982, Anwar, who was the founding leader and second president of a youth Islamic organisation called [[Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM)]], shocked his liberal supporters by joining the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), led by Mahathir bin Mohamad, who became prime minister in 1981. He moved up the political ranks quickly: his first ministerial office was that of Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports in 1983; after that, he headed the agriculture ministry in 1984 before becoming Minister of Education in 1986. By then, speculation was rife about Anwar's ascent to the Deputy Prime Minister's position as it was a commonly-occurring phenomenon in Malaysia for the Education Minister to assume the position of Deputy PM in the near future. 

During his tenure as Education Minister, Anwar introduced numerous pro-Malay policies in the national school curriculum. One of the major changes that he did was to rename the national language from Bahasa Malaysia to Bahasa Melayu. Non-Malays criticized this move as it would cause the younger generation to be detached from the national language, since they would attribute it to being something that belongs to the Malays and not to Malaysians.

In 1991 Anwar was appointed Minister of Finance. In 1993, he became Mahathir's Deputy Prime Minister after winning the Deputy Presidency of UMNO against Ghafar Baba. Anwar was being groomed to succeed Mahathir as prime minister, and frequently alluded in public to his "son-father" relationship with Mahathir; in early 1997, Mahathir appointed Anwar to be acting Prime Minister while he took a two-month holiday. Towards the end of the 1990s, however, their relationship began to deteriorate, triggered by their conflicting views on governance. In Mahathir's absence, Anwar had taken steps to improve the country's governing mechanisms which were in direct conflict with Mahathir's protectionist policies. Issues such as how Malaysia would respond to a financial crisis were often at the forefront of this conflict.

Anwar's frontal attack against what he described as the widespread culture of nepotism and cronyism within UMNO (and the ruling coalition as a whole) angered Mahathir, as did his attempts to dismantle the protectionist policies that Mahathir had set up. "Cronyism" was identified by Anwar as a major cause of corruption and misappropriation of funds in the country. Mahathir retaliated by isolating Anwar within UMNO. The events of late-1998 marked the beginning of Anwar's descent within UMNO and his subsequent ouster from the party and from Malaysian politics.

== Financial crisis ==
During the [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997 Anwar, in his capacity as finance minister, supported the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) plan for recovery, which meant a restructuring of the economy involving opening up to greater foreign investment and competition.  He also instituted an [[austerity]] package that slashed government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and deferred major investment projects. Large-scale infrastructure development projects known as "mega projects" were set back as well, despite being a cornerstone of Mahathir's plans for developing the nation. These measures aroused bitter opposition from Mahathir.  

Although many Malaysian companies faced the threat of bankruptcy, Anwar declared: "There is no question of any bailout. The banks will be allowed to protect themselves and the government will not interfere."  Anwar advocated a free market approach, sympathetic to foreign investment and trade liberalisation, whereas Mahathir favored currency and foreign investment controls, blaming unchecked speculation by currency speculators like [[George Soros]] for the shrinking economy.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} There is disagreement among economists whether Anwar's policies would have been more or less successful than Mahathir's; however, most denounced Mahathir's hypothesis that George Soros was to blame. Economists proposed currency controls before the Malaysian currency, the [[ringgit]], slid further, but their advice was not taken.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} By the time Mahathir decided to impose currency controls and preventive measures to keep hedge funds in check, the Malaysian economy had plummeted to its lowest level yet since the recession of the early-1980s. 

In 1998 ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine named Anwar the "Asian of the Year." However, in that year, matters between Anwar and Mahathir came to a head around the time of the quadrennial [[UMNO]] General Assembly. The Youth wing of UMNO, headed by Anwar's associate, [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], gave notice that it would initiate a debate on "cronyism and nepotism".  The response was swift, as Mahathir issued lists of cronies who had benefited from government share allocations and privatisations. To the chagrin of Anwar and his allies, several of them were on the list, including Anwar and Zahid.

Anwar continued his assault on what he called the rampant corruption within Mahathir's administration, by attempting to impose transparent audits on major conglomerates and business empires, which, he alleged, had been overcharging for government projects and evading taxes. One of the potential victims would have been Mahathir's son, [[Mirzan Mahathir]], who was a director in almost 100 private and [[Government-linked company|Government-linked companies]]. Conglomerates that were closely linked to the government, such as Renong, would have been adversely affected as well.

== Allegations == 
At the UMNO General Assembly, a book, ''50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM'' ("50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister") was circulated containing graphic sexual allegations as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar.  This book carried the byline Khalid Jafri, an ex-editor of the government-controlled newspaper ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' and former editor-in-chief of a failed magazine, ''Harian National''. Anwar obtained a court injunction to prevent further distribution of the book and filed a defamation action against the author. In August, police charged the author of the book with malicious publishing of false news. In September, the judge who had banned the book's distribution was transferred to a lower court despite being a senior judge, further raising concerns among the public about the independence of the judiciary.

Among the allegations in the book was that Anwar is a homosexual and that he is a serial adulterer. Many regarded the book as an outright fabrication but in a surprising turn of events, rather than investigating the author for libelous writing, the police were instructed to investigate instead the veracity of the claims. Consequently, Anwar was labeled by the government-controlled media as a womanizer and a homosexual even before any investigation had taken place to determine the truthfulness of the book's contents. The author died in 2005 of diabetic complications but not before the High Court found that the author had libeled Anwar Ibrahim in publishing the "50 Reasons" book and awarded Anwar Ibrahim millions of ringgit in compensation.

Recently, the former deputy President of Anwar's political party, Dr. Chandra Muzaffar, lambasted Anwar for his close ties to Paul Wolfowitz, a staunch Zionist and chief architect of the war in Iraq. In an interview on the BBC Hardtalk program after his release from prison, Anwar admitted to his friendship with Paul Wolfowitz, the former US deputy Secretary of Defence and former World Bank President. This allegation has strong repercussions in Muslim majority Malaysia{{Fact|date=March 2008}} which has no diplomatic ties with Israel. Most Malaysians also agree with the statement by former Malaysian Prime Minister{{Who|date=March 2008}}, Dr. Mahathir, that the "war on terror" is actually a "war on Islam".<ref>[http://sify.com/news/international/fullstory.php?id=13285283 Muslims can win, Mahathir tells OIC] Oct 16, 2003, ''Sify News''</ref>

==Trial and conviction==
Anwar was fired from the Cabinet in September, amid police reports that he was under investigation.  The following day, he was expelled from UMNO. Dr Munawar Anees, Anwar's former speechwriter, and Sukma Darmawan Sasmita Atmadja, Anwar's adoptive brother, were arrested under suspicion of engaging in homosexual acts. Five days later, they were given a jail sentence of six months after pleading guilty to "unnatural sex" with Anwar.  They later recanted their confessions, and appealed the sentence, claiming to have been coerced into entering a plea of "guilty". Anees made a statutory declaration of how they were coerced into making a guilty plea<ref>[http://www.c2o.org/malaysia/democracy/reports/981203_stat_dec_munawar_01.htm Statutory Declaration from Dr. Munawar Ahmad Anees (part 1)] Dec 3, 1998</ref>. Two of Anwar's secretaries, Ezam Mohamad and Mohamad Azmin Ali, were both held separately as part of police investigations into the "50 reasons" book. Both were later released.

A few days later Anwar addressed a protest gathering of nearly 100,000 people in [[Kuala Lumpur]], after which a number of his supporters marched to Mahathir's then official residence demanding ''reformasi'' (economic and political reforms) and Mahathir's resignation. This march, a rare event in Malaysia, caused concern in the government. That night, Anwar's home was raided by a masked and armed SWAT team from the Royal Malaysian Police. His arrest was announced several hours later, as were those of several of Anwar's supporters, although most of them were later released.

== Charges of corruption and sodomy ==
On [[September 29]], [[1998]] Anwar appeared in court and pleaded innocent to charges of corruption and [[sodomy]]. A photo of 
Anwar with black eye (which he gained from a beating, while handcuffed and blindfolded, by then [[Inspector General of Police]] [[Rahim Noor]]) and one hand raised became a symbol of the political opposition in many ''reformasi'' posters.

The black eye was explained by Mahathir Mohamad and Rahim Noor as being "self-inflicted" and caused by "pressing a glass over his eyes". Only after a Royal Commission was convened did Rahim Noor admit that he had administered the beating to Anwar. Both Anwar and Rahim Noor have denied the allegations that Anwar was sodomised in prison to "plant" the forensics evidence of anal sex in Anwar. 

During the trial, a mattress was presented to court, supposedly stained with Anwar's semen. This was submitted as DNA evidence of Anwar's sexual acts. However, Anwar denied having anything to do with the mattress although the DNA tests came out positive. The defense team alleged that Anwar was masturbated while unconscious. Dr Lim Kong Boon, a doctor during the trial <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/244570.stm Anwar trial hears DNA evidence] Dec 30, 1998, ''BBC News''</ref>, testified that it is possible to massage the prostrate gland through the anus in order to stimulate ejaculation in an unconscious victim. The defense council presented this as evidence for police sexual abuse to obtain false forensics evidence to frame Anwar.

Anwar was also accused of corruption relating to the police investigation into and arrest of the author of the "50 Reasons" book. He was also accused of sodomy with his wife's chauffeur, Azizan Abu Bakar. Judge Augustine Paul wrote 320 page judgment in the Anwar Ibrahim case, the longest judgment in the country ever. <ref>Public Prosecutor v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim[1998] 4 MLJ 481;Public Prosecutor v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (No 2) 1999] 2 MLJ 249; Public Prosecutor v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (No 3)[1999] 2 MLJ 1; and Public Prosecutor v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (No 4)[1999] 5 MLJ 545</ref> In that judgment, he explains meticulously point by point each and every piece of evidence involved and the rulings he made. 

During the trial, Mahathir appeared on Malaysian television in a special appearance to explain the arrest of his deputy. This was one of several occasions in which Mahathir declared Anwar guilty of sodomy and homosexual acts, even as the trial still was underway. The government included the statements of the purported victims of Anwar's sodomy attacks, evidence that was widely considered to be tainted.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Furthermore, the prosecution was unable to accurately decide on a date that the alleged acts of anal sex had occurred - the government originally alleged that a sodomy had occurred inside a building that had not been constructed at the time of the alleged event. Furthermore, the Attorney General's prosecution team (headed by Abdul Gani Patail) also submitted a scenario in which Dr Munawar Anees took an overnight flight from Britain all the way to Malaysia to be sodomized by Anwar, and flew back to Britain after that. The infamous "stained mattress" that was taken in and out of court over 20 times throughout the duration of the trial, was supposedly the same one that Anwar did his homosexual acts and extramarital sex on. However, according to the evidence, the sexual acts had taken place on the mattress a few years ago, and yet the DNA evidence obtained from it were rather recent in age.[note that DNA forensic dating is an inaccurate science].An NBC's interview revealed that Anwar finally admit he was the one who slept his adopt brother and convince him to do that.The tape was released on [[16 october]] [[2000]].

On [[April 14]], [[1999]], Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison for corruption and, on [[August 8]], [[2000]], nine years in prison  for sodomy.  The sentences were to be served consecutively, and Anwar was given no credit for the six months he spent in jail during the trial. The following year, Anwar's corruption conviction was upheld by Malaysia's Court of Appeal. In July 2002, Anwar lost his final appeal against the corruption conviction in the Federal Court.

In a speech during the proceedings against him, Anwar explained what he believed to be the underlying motive behind his persecution. He told the court: "I objected to the use of massive public funds to rescue the failed businesses of his (Mahathir's) children and cronies." Both [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] expressed doubts about the fairness of the trials. <ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA280152003?open&of=ENG-MYS Malaysia: Double injustice heaped on Anwar Ibrahim] Apr 18, 2003, ''Amnesty International''</ref> <ref>[http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jun/anwar0610.htm Human Rights Watch Monitors Second Anwar Trial] June 11, 1999, ''Human Rights Watch''</ref>. Amnesty International subsequently designated Anwar as a [[prisoner of conscience]]. The trial also provoked international criticism. US vice president [[Al Gore]] denounced the sodomy trial of Anwar as a "mockery", but Mahathir rejected all such international criticism as "foreign interference." <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/873592.stm Gore: Anwar trial a 'mockery Gore: Anwar trial a 'mockery'] Aug 9, 2000, ''BBC News''</ref>

Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail|Wan Azizah Ismail]], subsequently formed [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (the People's Justice Party), which based its platform on campaigning for Anwar's release and ''reformasi''. At the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|following general election]], the People's Justice Party performed poorly in the election, only retaining a single parliamentary seat, Anwar's old parliamentary seat of Permatang Pauh, which was won by his wife.

== Release from prison ==

On [[September 2]] [[2004]], a panel of three judges of the Federal Court (Malaysia's highest court) overturned the sodomy conviction by 2 to 1, finding contradictions in the prosecution's case. However, the judges noted "We find evidence to confirm that the appellants were involved in homosexual activities and we are more inclined to believe that the alleged incident at Tivoli Villa did happen."

Anwar completed his term for corruption after his sentence was being reduced for good behaviour. Although the point was by now moot, an appeal on the corruption charges was heard on [[September 6]], [[2004]]. Under Malaysian law a person is banned from political activities for five years after the end of his sentence. Success in this appeal would allow him an immediate return to politics. On [[September 7]], the court agreed to hear Anwar's appeal. However, on [[September 15]], the of Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that its previous decision to uphold a High Court ruling that found Anwar guilty was in order, relegating Anwar to the sidelines of Malaysian politics until [[14 April]] [[2008]]. The only way out for Anwar would be for him to receive a pardon from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.

At the time of his release from prison, Anwar was reportedly suffering from serious back problems, which his family said was the result of the beating by the ex-police chief. However, the UMNO-owned [[newspaper]], the ''[[New Straits Times]]'', alleged that the injuries had actually been caused by a fall from a horse in 1993 during Anwar's tenure as deputy prime minister.  His wife had argued during his imprisonment that he required treatment for his condition at a clinic in [[Germany]].  The government refused, claiming that such treatment was readily available in Malaysia, offering medical treatment if necessary.  However, in September 2004, after the Federal Court quashed his conviction for sodomy, Anwar was free to travel to [[Munich]] for back surgery. 

Since his release from prison Anwar has held a teaching positions at [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St. Antony's College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he was a Visiting fellow and Senior associate member and at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies|School of Advance International Studies]] in [[Washington DC]] as a Distinguished Senior Visiting Fellow. He is currently a Distinguished Visiting Professor in the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]]. In March 2006 he was appointed as Honorary President of the London based organization Accountability ([http://www.accountability.org.uk/ AccountAbility]). 

In July 2006, Anwar was elected Chair of the Washington-based [[Foundation for the Future]] <ref>[http://www.foundationforfuture.org/press_releases/july15.html Foundation for the Future Holds its First Board Meeting in Doha, Qatar], July 15, 2006</ref>. In this capacity, he signed the October 1, 2006 letter to [[Robin Cleveland]] of the [[World Bank]], requesting the transfer of the secondment of [[Shaha Riza]] from the [[US Department of State]] to the Foundation for the Future <ref>[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21297772~menuPK:34463~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html Ethics Committee Case No2 and President's Paper, p.102], Jun 2, 2005, ''World Bank''</ref>.

==Political future==

In November 2006, Anwar announced he planned to run for Parliament in 2008, after his disqualification expired. Anwar has been critical of government policies since his release from prison, most notably of the controversial [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which provides [[affirmative action]] for the Malays. The policy sets a number of quotas, such as for units of housing and [[initial public offering]]s, that must be met.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aAjtL0wmitME&refer=home Malaysia's Anwar Says He Plans to Run for Parliament] Nov 30, 2006, ''Bloomberg''.</ref> 

He is also the Advisor of [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]], the party of which his wife Dr. Wan Azizah is president.  He was in the forefront in organising a November 2007 mass rally, called the [[2007 Bersih Rally]], which took place in the [[Dataran Merdeka]] Kuala Lumpur to demand clean and fair elections. The gathering was organised by BERSIH, a coalition comprising political parties and civil society groups, and drew supporters from all over the country.

The [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 election]] date, however, was set for [[8 March]] [[2008]], sparking criticisms that Barisan Nasional called for early elections in a bid to deny Anwar's plans for a return to Parliament. In response, Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, declared that she would step down should she retain her Permatang Pauh parliamentary seat to force a by-election in which Anwar himself will contest<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/specialreport/view/1457/1/.html Wan Azizah declares she is Anwar proxy] Feb 25, 2008, ''Channel NewsAsia''</ref>.

When asked about the possibility of Anwar becoming the next Prime Minister, former leader Tun Dr. Mahathir has reacted by saying rather sarcastically, "He would make a good Prime Minister of Israel".<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/mni/when-mahathir-lashes-at-anwar-who-is-he-really-after.html "When Mahathir lashes out at Anwar, will it catch fire?"] March 31, 2008, ''The Malaysian Insider. ''</ref>

On 14 April 2008, Anwar celebrated his official return to the political stage, as his ban from public office expires a decade after he was sacked as deputy prime minister.  One of the main reasons the opposition seized a third of parliamentary seats and five states in the worst ever showing for the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for half a century, was due to him leading at the helm.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hFSMeru-BqR2BIAOAQY_ul-3Klhg "Malaysian opposition leader Anwar marks end of political ban"] April 14, 2008, ''AFP''</ref> A gathering of more than 10,000 supporters greeted Anwar in a rally welcoming back his return to politics.  In the midst of the rally, police interrupted Anwar after he had addressed the rally for nearly two hours and called him to stop the gathering since there is no legal permission of the rally.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvk18e1IzUJ9V-VNzo1_wg-4mkWgD901NSVO3 "Malaysia Police Halt Anwar Speech"] April 14, 2008, ''AFP''</ref>

On [[April 29]], [[2008]], and after 10 years of absence, Anwar Ibrahim returned to the Parliament, albeit upon invitation as a spouse guest of [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]], People's Justice Party and the first female opposition leader in Malaysian Parliament's history.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hVCWRBldBYxuA8tEDUuzhW0xqUyQD90BEGP00 Malaysia's Anwar returns to Parliament], Apr 29, 2008, ''Associated Press''</ref>
