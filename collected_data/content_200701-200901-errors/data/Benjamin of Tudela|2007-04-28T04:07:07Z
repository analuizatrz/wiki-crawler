'''Benjamin of Tudela''' ([[Floruit|fl.]] [[12th century]]) was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrese]] [[Jew]]ish [[rabbi]] and [[explorer]]. In his journey he passed through large swathes of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].   His vivid descriptions of [[Asia]] preceded those of [[Marco Polo]] by a hundred years. With his broad education and vast knowledge of languages, Benjamin of Tudela was a major figure in the history of [[geography]] and [[Jewish history]].

==The journey==
Benjamin set out on his 13-year journey in [[1160]], in what began as a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. He may have hoped to settle there, but there is controversy about the reasons for his travels; for example, it has been suggested he may have had a commercial motive as well as a religious one. He took the "long road" stopping frequently, meeting people, visiting places, describing occupations and giving a demographic count of Jews in every town and country.

Born Benjamin MiTudelo, little is known of his life<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/BenjaminTudelo.html "Benjamin of Tudela"], from the [[Jewish Virtual Library]]</ref>. In some sense the journey must have begun in the Spanish town of [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], where today a street in the [[aljama]] is named after him. However, the published version begins in the city of [[Zaragoza]], further down the valley of the [[Ebro]], whence he proceeded north to [[France]],  and then set sail from the port of [[Marseilles]]. After visiting [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]], he set off across Asia, visiting [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] before reaching [[Baghdad]]. From there he went to [[Persian Empire|Persia]], then cut back across the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to [[Egypt]] and [[North Africa]], returning to Spain in [[1173]]. In all he visited over 300 cities including Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Damascus, Baghdad and beyond.

He described his 13 years abroad in a book, ''The Voyages of Benjamin'' (מסעות בנימין, ''Masa'ot Binyamin'', also known as ספר המסעות, ''Sefer ha-Masa'ot'', ''The Book of Travels''). This book describes the countries he visited, with an emphasis on the Jewish communities, including their total populations and the names of notable community leaders. He also described the customs of the local population, both Jewish and non-Jewish, with an emphasis on urban life there. There are also detailed descriptions of sites and landmarks he passed along the way, as well as important buildings and marketplaces. Benjamin is noted for not only telling facts, but citing his sources; historians regard him as highly trustworthy.

''The Voyages of Benjamin'' is an important work not only as a description of the Jewish communities, but also as a reliable source about the geography and [[ethnography]] of the Middle Ages. As well some modern historians credit Benjamin as giving very accurate descriptions of every-day life in the Middle Ages. Originally written in Hebrew, it was translated in to Latin and later translated into most major European languages, receiving considerable attention in the sixteenth century.
