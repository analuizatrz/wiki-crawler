'''Key''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] studio under [[Visual Art's]], known for making dramatic and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]-oriented [[dating sim]]s. Their debut release ''[[Kanon]]'' was hugely successful in Japan. It combined an elaborate and sentimental storyline, an up-to-date [[anime]] drawing style and a popular musical score. Their second game, ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', was similarly well received in Japan, having a similar if not more complex storyline. Both ''Kanon'' and ''Air'' sold over a million copies and also had non-erotic console ports released for the [[Dreamcast]] and the [[PlayStation 2]].

''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]'' is a [[dating sim]] similar to its previous games, but is entirely clean, without any [[Hentai|adult]] content. ''Clannad'' suffered many delays before its release, leading to a great deal of anticipation from fans. The game finally released in 2004 and, although with more than two years of delay, was still popular. In 2004, Key released ''[[Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume]]''. ''Planetarian'', in contrast to Key's past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make a choice, but to sit back and enjoy the story; this is what Key referred to as a ''[[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]]''. ''Planetarian'' is the shortest of Key's games.

Key has their own music label named [[Key Sounds Label]]; every soundtrack that is released based from one of Key's titles is on this label. There are other albums on the label not directly related to the visual novels, such as two albums by [[Lia (singer)|Lia]] and one by [[Eufonius]]. The albums on this label have music composed by members from Key.

==History==
Before forming Key (a brand of [[Osaka]]-based [[Visual Art's]]), the founding members worked for another development company called [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]]. While employed there, they contributed to three games: ''[[Dōsei]]'', ''[[Moon.]]'' and ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]''. After the release of ''One'', these developers transferred to [[Visual Art's]], where they created their debut title ''Kanon''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=36881&page=3|title=AnimeSuki forums regarding pre-Key Tactics games|accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref>
