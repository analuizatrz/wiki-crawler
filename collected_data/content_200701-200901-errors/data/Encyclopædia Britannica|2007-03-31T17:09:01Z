The '''''Encyclopædia Britannica''''' is a general [[encyclopedia]] targeted at educated adult readers and published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]], a [[privately held company]].   Its articles are written by a staff of 19 full-time editors and over four thousand expert contributors.  The ''Britannica'' is widely considered the standard by which other encyclopedias are measured.<ref name="kister_1994">{{cite book | last = Kister | first = KF | authorlink = Kenneth Kister | year = 1994 | title = Kister's Best Encyclopedias: A Comparative Guide to General and Specialized Encyclopedias | edition = 2nd ed. | publisher = Oryx Press | location = Phoenix, AZ | id = ISBN 0-89774-744-5}}</ref><ref name="sader_1995" />

The current 15th edition has a unique three-part structure: a 12-volume ''[[Micropædia]]'' of short articles (less than 750 words), a 17-volume ''[[Macropædia]]'' of long articles (2-310 pages) and a single ''[[Propædia]]'' volume intended to give a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] outline of all human knowledge.  The ''Micropædia'' is meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the ''Macropædia''; readers are advised to study the ''Propædia'' outline to understand a subject's context and find other, more detailed articles.<ref name="propedia_preface">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = 5&ndash;8}}</ref>  The size of the ''Britannica'' has remained roughly constant over the last 70 years, with ca. 40 million words on ca. half a million topics.<ref name="index_preface" >{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''Index'' preface}}</ref>  Although publication has been based in the [[United States]] since [[1901]], the ''Britannica'' has maintained its traditional [[American and British English spelling differences|British spelling]].<ref name="kister_1994" /> 

Over the course of its history, the ''Britannica'' has had difficulty remaining profitable (a problem faced by many encyclopedias).<ref name="EB_encyclopedia" />  Ownership of the ''Britannica'' has changed several times, passing from the original founders, friends and heirs, to the Scottish publisher [[A & C Black]], to [[Horace Everett Hooper]], to [[Sears Roebuck]] and [[William Benton]];  the present owner of [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] is [[Jacqui Safra]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] billionaire and actor.  Recent challenges have been the wealth of online information and the rise of electronic encyclopedias such as ''[[Encarta]]'', which has reduced the demand for print encyclopedias;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/40033.stm | title = Encyclopaedia Britannica changes to survive | last = Day | first = Peter | date = [[17 December]] [[1997]] | publisher = [[BBC News]] | quote = Sales plummeted from 100,000 a year to just 20,000. | accessdate = 2007-03-27}}</ref>  To remain competitive, the ''Britannica'' has relied on its reputation, reduced its price and costs, and developed electronic versions on CD-ROM, [[DVD]] and the [[World Wide Web]].  Since the early 1930s, the ''Britannica'' has also promoted spin-off reference works.  Certain earlier editions of the ''Britannica'' have been criticized at times for inaccuracies, biases and lack of authority;<ref name="kogan_1958" /><ref name="burr_1911" /> the accuracy of the present edition has likewise been questioned,<ref name="kister_1994" /><ref name="Giles_Nature_study_2005" /> although such criticisms have been challenged by the ''Britannica's'' management.<ref name="fatally_flawed" />

==History==
{{main|History of the Encyclopædia Britannica}}
===History of editions===
The ''Britannica'' has had 15 official editions, and numerous supplements and re-organizations.  The history of the ''Britannica'' can be usefully divided into five main eras.  

In the first era (1st-6th editions, 1768-1826), the ''Britannica'' was managed by its original founders, [[Colin Macfarquhar]] and [[Andrew Bell]], and by their friends and relations, such as [[Thomas Bonar]], [[George Gleig]] and [[Archibald Constable]].  The ''Britannica'' was first published from 1768–1771 in [[Edinburgh]] as the '''''Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A dictionary of arts and sciences, compiled upon a new plan'''''.  It was primarily a Scottish enterprise, an enduring legacy of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], as symbolized by its [[thistle]] logo, the [[Scotland#National symbols|floral emblem]] of [[Scotland]].  In this era, the ''Britannica'' moved from being a 3-volume set of dubious scholarship (1st edition)<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Krapp |first=Philip |coauthors=Balou, Patricia K. |year=1992 |title=Collier's Encyclopedia |volume=9 |pages=p. 135 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Company |location=[[New York City|New York]] |id=Library of Congress catalog number 91-61165}} The ''Britannica's'' 1st edition is described as "deplorably inaccurate and unscientific" in places.</ref> to a 20-volume set with authoritative articles.  Although several other encyclopedias competed with the ''Britannica'', such as ''[[Rees's Cyclopaedia]]'' and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Encyclopaedia Metropolitana]]'', these competitors generally went bankrupt or were left unfinished due to disagreements among its editors.  By the close of this era, the ''Britannica'' had developed a network of illustrious contributors, primarily through personal friendships with the editors, most notably Constable and Gleig. 

During the second era (7th-9th editions, 1827-1901), the ''Britannica'' was managed by the [[Edinburgh]] publishing firm, [[A & C Black]].  Contributors of this era are perhaps the most eminent authorities ever assembled by the ''Britannica'', and included many authorities outside of [[Scotland]].  Many contributors were again recruited through personal friendships of the chief editors, most notably [[Macvey Napier]], but others were attracted by the ''Britannica's'' increasingly excellent reputation.  A general index of all articles was included in the 7th edition, a practice that was maintained until 1974; the 2nd-6th editions had indexed individual long articles, but not the encyclopedia as a whole.  The first English-born editor-in-chief was [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]], who oversaw the production of the justly famous 9th edition.  By the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated and the ''Britannica'' itself was facing significant financial difficulties.

In the third era (10th-14th editions, 1901-1973), the ''Britannica'' was bought and managed by an American partnership, who introduced aggressive marketing practices, such as [[direct marketing]] and [[door-to-door]] sales, to improve its profitability.  The American owners also gradually simplified the ''Britannica's'' articles, making them less scholarly but more intelligible to the American mass market.  The 10th edition was a quickly done supplement to the 9th edition, but the 11th edition is still praised for its excellence; its owner, [[Horace Everett Hooper|Horace Hooper]], lavished enormous effort on its perfection.<ref name="kogan_1958" />  After Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the ''Britannica'' was owned by [[Sears Roebuck]] for roughly 18 years (1920-1923, 1928-1943).  In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, [[Elkan Harrison Powell]], assumed the presidency of the ''Britannica'' and introduced the policy of continuous revision (still practiced today), in which every article is checked and possibly revised at least twice a decade.  This was a major departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced (ca. 25 years); some articles were even carried over unchanged from earlier editions.<ref name="encyclopedia_1954" /> Powell also began to aggressively develop new educational products that leveraged the ''Britannica's'' reputation.  In 1943, ownership passed to Senator and advertising mogul [[William Benton]], who managed the ''Britannica'' until his death in 1973, after which ownership passed to the [[Benton Foundation]].  In 1968, near the end of this era, the ''Britannica'' celebrated [[Bicentennial of the Encyclopædia Britannica|its bicentennial]].

In the fourth era (15th edition, 1974-1994), the ''Britannica'' introduced its 15th edition, which was radically re-organized into three parts.  Under the influence of [[Mortimer J. Adler]], the ''Britannica'' sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but also to systematize all of human knowledge, striving to fulfill the dream of the [[Elizabethan]] philosopher, [[Francis Bacon]].  The unfamiliar organization and the absence of an index led to critical condemnation of the 15th edition;<ref name="kister_1994" /> therefore, it was completely re-organized and indexed for its re-release in 1984.  This second version of the 15th edition continues to be published and revised; the latest version is the 2007 print version.

In the fifth era (1994-present), digital versions of the ''Britannica'' have been developed and released as CD/DVD-ROM and online.  In 1996, the ''Britannica'' was bought from the [[Benton Foundation]] by [[Jacqui Safra]] at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties.  The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] company split into two parts in 1999, with one part (responsible for the print version) retaining the company name and the other part (responsible for developing the digital versions) being called [[Britannica.com Inc.]].  Since 2001, these two companies share a single [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Ilan Yeshua]], who has continued [[Elkan Harrison Powell|Powell's]] strategy of leveraging the ''Britannica's'' reputation to introduce new information products.

As stated at its [[Bicentennial of the Encyclopædia Britannica|bicentennial celebration]], the editing of the ''Britannica'' has been guided by three principles throughout its history: to be an excellent reference book, to provide educational material for those who wish to study, and to systematize all human knowledge,<ref name="EB_bicentennial" /> goals shared with many of the world's best encyclopedias.<ref name="EB_encyclopedia" />

===History of dedications===
The ''Britannica'' was [[Dedication#Book dedication|dedicated]] to the reigning [[British monarch]] from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an [[United States|American]] partnership, to the current [[President of the United States]] as well as the British monarch.<ref name="kister_1994" />  For example, the 11th edition is dedicated "by Permission to His Majesty [[George V of the United Kingdom|George the Fifth]], King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and to [[William Howard Taft]], President of the United States of America."<ref name="EB_1911">{{cite book | year = 1910 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 11<sup>th</sup> edition| pages = p.3}}</ref>  The order of the two dedications changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with the relative sales of the ''Britannica'' in the two lands; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is "Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight David Eisenhower]], President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth the Second]]".<ref name="EB_1954">{{cite book | year = 1954 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 14<sup>th</sup> edition| pages = p.3}}</ref>  Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition is "dedicated by permission to the current President of the United States of America, [[George W. Bush]], and Her Majesty, [[Queen Elizabeth II]]."<ref name="propedia_3">{{cite book | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, volume 30, ''Propædia'' | pages = p.3}}</ref>

==Critical and popular assessments==
===Reputation===
Since the 3rd edition, the ''Britannica'' has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence.<ref name="kister_1994" /><ref name="sader_1995" >{{cite book | last = Sader | first = Marian | coauthors = Lewis, Amy | year = 1995 | title = Encyclopedias, Atlases, and Dictionaries | publisher = R.

The ''Britannica'' has a popular reputation for containing the sum of human culture.<ref name="thomas_1992" />  To further their education, many have devoted themselves to reading the entire ''Britannica'', taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so.<ref name="kogan_1958" /> When [[Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar|Fath Ali]] became the [[Iranian monarchy|Shah of Persia]] in 1797, he was given a complete set of the ''Britannica's'' third edition, which he read completely; after this remarkable feat of scholarship, he extended his royal title to include "Most Formidable Lord and Master of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''."<ref name="EB_bicentennial" >{{cite book | year = 1968 | title = Banquet at Guildhall in the City of London, Tuesday 15 October 1968: Celebrating the 200th Anniversary of the Encyclopædia Britannica and the 25th Anniversary of the Honorable William Benton as its Chairman and Publisher | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica International, Ltd.]] | location = [[United Kingdom]]}}</ref> More recently, [[A.J. Jacobs]], an editor at ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition ''Britannica'', describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book, ''[[The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World]]''. [[George Bernard Shaw]] claimed to have read the complete 9th edition &mdash; except for the scientific articles.  Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author [[C. S. Forester]]<ref name="kogan_1958" /> and [[Amos Urban Shirk]], an American businessman, who read the 11th edition over four and a half years and the 14th edition, reading roughly three hours per night.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reader | journal = The New Yorker | volume = 9 | date = [[3 March]] [[1934]] | page = 17}}</ref>  [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] took the ''Britannica'' as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934.

===Awards===
The ''Britannica'' has won many awards of recognition. Most recently, the online ''Britannica'' won the 2005 [[Codie awards|Codie award]] for excellence in reference software; the Codie awards are granted yearly by the [[Software and Information Industry Association]] (SIIA) to honor the best products in various fields of software.  In 2006, the ''Britannica'' was a finalist, but the award went to [[Answers.com]].  Similarly, the CD/DVD-ROM version of the ''Britannica'' was recognized with the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the [[Association of Educational Publishers]], and with Codie Awards in 2001 and 2002.

===Criticisms===
The ''Britannica'' has also received strong criticism, especially as its editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the ''Britannica,'' and editors generally delay this as long as fiscally possible (usually 25 years or so).<ref name="encyclopedia_1954">{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1954 | title = Encyclopædia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 14<sup>th</sup> edition}}</ref>  For example, despite the policy of continuous revision, the 14th edition had become significantly outdated after 35 years (1929-1964); after [[Harvey Einbinder]] detailed its failings in his book, ''The Myth of the Britannica'' (1964),  the ''Britannica'' was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work.<ref name="kister_1994" />  Even now, it is hard to keep the ''Britannica'' current; one recent critic writes that, "it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision," noting that the longer ''Macropædia'' articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter ''Micropædia'' articles.<ref name="kister_1994" />  
The ''Britannica'' has also been criticized for having bourgeois and old-fashioned tastes in art, literature and social sciences; for example, the 11th edition was faulted for neglecting the work of [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref name="thomas_1992" >{{cite book| last = Thomas | first = Gillian | authorlink = Gillian Thomas | year = 1992 | title = A Position to Command Respect: Women and the Eleventh Britannica | publisher = Scarecrow Press | id = ISBN 0-8108-2567-8}}</ref>  Contributors to the ''Britannica'' have also been criticized for writing on topics in which they lack expertise, as in the following review of its coverage of European history<ref name="burr_1911">{{cite journal | last = Burr | first = George L. | year = 1911 | title = The Encyclopaedia Britannica | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 17 | pages = 108}}</ref>

{{cquote|With a temerity almost appalling, [the ''Britannica'' contributor, Mr. Philips] ranges over nearly the whole field of European history, political, social, ecclesiastical...The grievance is that [this work] lacks authority.  This, too &mdash; this reliance on editorial energy instead of on ripe special learning &mdash; may also be counted as "Americanizing": for certainly nothing has so cheapened the scholarship of our American encyclopaedias.|20px|20px|Prof. George L. Burr|in the ''American Historical Review''}}

The first version of the 15th edition (1974-1985) drew particular criticism.  The removal of the index was condemned by many critics, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the ''[[Micropædia]]'' and ''[[Macropædia]]''.<ref name="kister_1994" />  The stated aim of categorizing all possible human knowledge in the ''[[Propædia]]'' was characterized as "pretentious"; more generally, one critic called the edition a "qualified failure...[that] cares more for juggling its format than for preserving information".<ref name="Newsweek_1974" >{{cite journal | last = Prescott | first = Peter S. | title = The Fifteenth Britannica | journal = Newsweek | date = [[8 July]] [[1974]] | pages = 71–72}}</ref> 

Given its relatively constant size, the ''Britannica'' has had to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others; for example, the 1989 ''[[Macropædia]]'' article on "[[Adhesives]]" was reduced from 7 pages to one and a half pages and subsumed into another article ("[[Polymer#Industry|Industrial Polymers]]") for the 1992 version.  Naturally, the ''Britannica'' has been criticized for some of these editorial choices.  For example, the initial 15th edition (1974) was faulted for having drastically reduced or eliminated its coverage of the French poet [[Joachim du Bellay]], [[children's literature]],  and [[military decoration]]s, and also for its editorial mistakes.<ref name="Newsweek_1974" />

The ''Britannica''-appointed contributors are occasionally mistaken or unscientific.  An example is its chief editor, [[George Gleig]], who rejected the established scientific theory of [[Newtonian gravity]] and wrote that gravity was caused by the [[fire (classical element)|classical element of fire]].  Another example is the credulous article on [[poltergeist]]s in the 11th edition, a then-popular topic of superstition;<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Lang | first = Andrew | year = 1911 | title = Poltergeist | url = http://1911encyclopedia.org/Poltergeist | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc]]}}</ref> the article states that "there remains the chance that some agency of an unexplored nature is, at least in certain cases, actually at work."  

Even now, the ''Britannica'' occasionally makes false claims about itself.  For example, its [http://open.britannica.com/ Open Britannica] site claims that the ''Britannica'' developed "the first encyclopedia in the English language, the first multimedia encyclopedia on CD-ROM, and the first encyclopedia on the [[Internet]]."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://open.britannica.com/ | title = open.britannica.com | accessdate = 2007-03-28}}</ref>  Two of these claims are false and the third is misleading.  At least three major English-language encyclopedias were published decades prior to the ''Britannica:'' the ''Lexicon technicum, or An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences'' by [[John Harris]] (two volumes, published 1704 and 1710, respectively); the ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' of [[Ephraim Chambers]] (published 1728); and ''An Universal History of Arts and Sciences'' of [[Dennis de Coetlogon]] (published 1745).<ref name="encyclopedia_1954" />  There was also an earlier English-language translation of the encyclopedia ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the properties of things)'' (1240) by [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]].<ref name="EB_encyclopedia" />  The first online encyclopedia was the [[Academic American Encyclopedia]] in 1983, which was also the first encyclopedia published on CD-ROM (1985), becoming multimedia in 1990.<ref name="EB_encyclopedia" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://go.grolier.com/go-ol/static/features/gmefeatrs.htm | title = Grolier Online | accessdate = 2007-03-30}}</ref>  Although the first multimedia encyclopedia was ''[[Compton's Encyclopedia]]'' (1989) — then owned by the same [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|parent company]] as the ''Britannica'' — the ''Britannica'' itself was not released on a multimedia CD until 1995.<ref name="EB_encyclopedia" /> 

Past editions of the ''Britannica'' have also been marred by racism and sexism.  As an example of racism, the 11th edition characterizes the [[Ku Klux Klan]] as protecting the white race and restoring order to the South after the Civil War, citing the need to "control the negro," to "prevent any intermingling of the races" and "the frequent occurrence of the crime of rape by negro men upon white women."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Fleming | first = Walter Lynwood | year = 1911 | title = Lynch Law | url = http://1911encyclopedia.org/Lynch_Law | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Fleming | first = Walter Lynwood | year = 1911 | title = Ku Klux Klan | url = http://1911encyclopedia.org/Ku_Klux_Klan | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc]]}}</ref>  As an example of sexism, the British editor-in-chief, [[Hugh Chisholm]], stated explicitly that women's expertise was properly confined to "social and purely feminine affairs".<ref name="thomas_1992" />  The 11th edition likewise has no biography of [[Marie Curie]], despite her winning the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1903 and the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1911.  Although it employed a large female staff for editorial, secretarial and librarian tasks,<ref name="thomas_1992" /> the ''Britannica'' played a key role in denying women the right to better-paying work as typesetters on the 11th edition.<ref name="reynolds_1989" >{{cite book| last = Reynolds | first = Siân | year = 1989 | title = Britannica's Typesetters: Women Compositors in Edwardian Edinburgh | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | location = Edinburgh | id = ISBN 0-85224-634-X}}</ref>   

The ''Britannica'' has also been criticized unfairly.  A well-known example is [[Willard Huntington Wright]]'s book, [http://www.archive.org/details/misinformingnati00vanduoft ''Misinforming a Nation''], a scathing critique of the inaccuracies and English biases of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]''.  However, this book was immediately criticized as an unfair polemic; the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that a "spiteful and shallow temper . . . pervades the book," whereas ''[[The New Republic]]'' opined, "it is unfortunate for Mr. Wright's remorseless purpose that he has proceeded in an unscientific spirit and given so little objective justification of his criticism."<ref name="kogan_1958" />  A somewhat more credible critic, [[Joseph McCabe]], criticized the ''Britannica'' as being susceptible to editorial pressure from the Roman Catholic Church in his book, ''[http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/joseph_mccabe/lies_of_britannica.html Lies And Fallacies Of The Encyclopedia Britannica]''.

== Status in 2007 ==
[[Image:Encyclopaedia Britannica 15 with 2002.jpg|thumb|250px|15th edition of the ''Britannica''. The initial volume with the green spine is the ''Propædia;'' the red-spined and black-spined volumes are the ''Micropædia'' and the ''Macropædia,'' respectively. The last three volumes are the 2002 Book of the Year (black spine) and the two-volume index (cyan spine).]]

===2007 print version===
Since 1974, the ''Britannica'' has had four parts: the ''[[Micropædia]],'' the ''[[Macropædia]],'' the ''[[Propædia]],'' and a two-volume index.  The ''Britannica's'' articles are found in the ''Micro-'' and ''Macropædia,'' which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly 1,000 pages. The ''Macropædia'' has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the ''Micropædia'' has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority of which have fewer than 750 words, no references and no named contributors.  The ''Micropædia'' articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the ''Macropædia;'' the ''Macropædia'' articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere.  

Information is usually found in the ''Britannica'' using the alphabetical index or the ''Propædia,'' which organizes the ''Britannica's'' contents by topic.<ref name="index_preface" />  The core of the ''Propædia'' is its "Outline of Knowledge," which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge.<ref name="propedia_preface" />  The Propædia also has several appendices listing the staff members, advisors and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica.  Information can also be found by following the cross-references in the ''Micropædia'' and ''Macropædia;'' however, these are relatively sparse, averaging one cross-reference per page.<ref name="sader_1995" />

Taken together, the ''Micropædia'' and ''Macropædia'' comprise ca. 40 million words with ca. 24,000 images.<ref name="index_preface" />  The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the ''Britannica,'' together with 474,675 subentries under those topics.<ref name="sader_1995" />  The ''Britannica'' generally prefers [[British English|British spelling]] over [[American English|American]];<ref name="sader_1995" /> for example, it uses ''colour'' (not ''color''), ''centre'' (not ''center''), and ''encyclopaedia'' (not ''encyclopedia'').  However, there are exceptions to this rule, e.g., ''defense'' (not ''defence'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Defense mechanism | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed. |  publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] | date = 2007 | volume = 3 | page = 957}}</ref>  Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references, e.g., "Color: ''see'' Colour."  

Since 1933, the ''Britannica'' has been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of its articles considered for revision every year.<ref name="encyclopedia_1954" /><ref name="sader_1995" />  According to its publisher, 46% of its articles were revised in the years 2003-2006.<ref>[http://corporate.britannica.com/library/print/eb.html Encyclopædia Britannica School & Library Site] Accessed 09/27/2006</ref>

The alphabetization of articles in the ''Micropædia'' and ''Macropædia'' follows strict rules.<ref name="micropedia_preface" >{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''Micropædia'' preface}}</ref>  Diacritical marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as "[[War of 1812|1812, War of]]" are alphabetized as if the number had been written out ("Eighteen-twelve, War of").  Articles with identical names are arranged in the order: persons, followed by places, followed by things.  Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country name and then, within each country, chronologically; for example, [[Charles the Simple|Charles III]] of [[France]] precedes [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] of [[Great Britain]].  Similarly, places with identical names are organized alphabetically by country name, and then by ever smaller political divisions.

=== Mobile Encyclopedia ===
On [[February 20]], [[2007]], the ''Britannica'' announced it was working with [[AskMeNow]] to launch a mobile encyclopedia.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mirror99.com/20070221/encyclopaedia_britannica_selects_askmenow_to_launch_mobile_geae.jspx  | title = Encyclopaedia Britannica Selects AskMeNow to Launch Mobile Encylopedia | date = [[21 February]] [[2007]] | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref> Users will be able to send a question via text message. AskMeNow will then search ''Britannica'''s 28,000-article concise encyclopedia to return an answer to the query. Britannica Mobile Dailies are also planned - daily topical features sent directly to users' mobile phones.

===Coverage of topics===
As a general encyclopedia, the ''Britannica'' seeks to describe as wide a range of topics as possible.  The articles chosen to be covered are determined in part by the ''[[Propædia]]'' "Outline of Knowledge".<ref name="propedia_preface" />  The ''Britannica'' devotes many of its article to geography (26% of the ''[[Macropædia]]''), biographies (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophies (4%), and law (3%).<ref name="kister_1994" />  Another study of the ''[[Micropædia]]'' found that science accounted for 18% of all articles, social sciences 17%, geography 25%, biographies 17% and other humanities 25%.<ref name="sader_1995" /> The ''Britannica'' does not cover equivalent topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of [[Buddhism]] and most other religions is covered in a single ''[[Macropædia]]'' article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to [[Christianity]], nearly half of all the ''Macropædia'' religion articles.  However, the ''Britannica'' has also been lauded as the ''least'' biased of all general encyclopedias marketed to Western readers<ref name="kister_1994" /> and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.<ref name="sader_1995" />

{{cquote|It can be stated without fear of contradiction that the 15th edition of the ''Britannica''  accords non-Western cultural, social, and scientific developments more notice than any general English-language encyclopedia currently on the market.|20|20|[[Kenneth Kister]]|in ''Kister's Best Encyclopedias''}}

==Contributors, staff, and management==
===Contributors===
The [[2007]] print version of the ''Britannica'' boasts 4,411 contributors, many of whom are eminent in their fields such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[Michael DeBakey]] and [[Carl Sagan]].  Roughly one-quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 ([[Alfred North Whitehead]]), while roughly another quarter are retired or emeritus.  Most (≈98%) contribute to only a single article; however, there are 64 contributors of three articles, 23 contributors of four articles, 10 contributors of five articles, and 8 contributors of more than five articles.  An exceptionally prolific contributor is Dr. [[Christine Sutton]] of the [[University of Oxford]], who contributed 24 articles on [[particle physics]].

=== Staff ===

{{Details|Staff of the Encyclopædia Britannica}}

[[Dale Hoiberg]], a [[sinology|sinologist]], is the ''Britannica's'' Senior Vice President and editor-in-chief.<ref name="propedia_staff">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = p.745}}</ref> Among his predecessors as editors-in-chief were [[Hugh Chisholm]] ([[1903]]–[[1913]], [[1920]]–[[1924]]), [[James Louis Garvin]] ([[1926]]–[[1932]]), [[Franklin Henry Hooper]] ([[1932]]–[[1938]]), [[Walter Yust]] ([[1938]]–[[1960]]), [[Harry Ashmore]] ([[1960]]–[[1963]]), [[Warren E.

Goetz]] ([[1979]]-[[1991]]),<ref name="kister_1994" /> and [[Robert McHenry]] ([[1992]]–[[1997]]).<ref name="Britannica History">{{cite web |url=http://corporate.britannica.com/company_info.html
|title=History of Encyclopædia Britannica and Britannica Online |accessmonthday=October 17 |accessyear=2006 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}</ref> [[Anita Wolff]] and [[Theodore Pappas]] serve as the current Deputy Editor and Executive Editor, respectively.<ref name="propedia_staff" />  Prior Executive Editors include [[John V. Dodge]] ([[1950]]–[[1964]]) and [[Philip W. Goetz]].

The ''Britannica'' maintains an editorial staff of five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by [[Dale Hoiberg]] and four others.  These editors are partly responsible for contributing the mostly anonymous, mostly unreferenced articles of the ''Micropædia'' as well as some sections of the ''Macropædia'', e.g., the initial section describing [[protein]]s under its article "Biochemical Components of Organisms".<ref name="EB_biochemistry">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Biochemical Components of Organisms | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed. |  publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] | date = 2007 | volume = 14 | pages = 1007&ndash;1030}}</ref>

===Editorial advisors===
The ''Britannica'' has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which currently includes 14 distinguished scholars: former [[Ecuador]]ian president [[Rosalía Arteaga]], Physiology/Medicine [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[David Baltimore]], religion scholar [[Wendy Doniger]], [[political economy|political economist]] [[Benjamin M. Friedman]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]] President [[Emeritus]] [[Leslie H. Gelb]], Physics [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Murray Gell-Mann]],  [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] President [[Vartan Gregorian]], [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] winner [[Zaha Hadid]], [[American Civil War]] [[historian]] [[James M. McPherson]], philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]], cognitive scientist [[Donald Norman]], [[musicology|musicologist]] [[Don Michael Randel]], economist [[Amartya Sen]],  and [[Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood]] and a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]].<ref name="propedia_editorial advisors">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = p.5}}</ref><ref>[http://corporate.britannica.com/board/ Encyclopædia Britannica Board of Editors] Accessed 09/27/2006</ref>  The [[median]] age of these advisors is around 70 years old.

The ''Propædia'' lists dozens of other editorial advisors, including many who have since died, the earliest in 1967 ([[Norwood Hanson]]).<ref name="propedia_other_editorial_advisors">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = 524&ndash;530}}</ref> For example, 74% of the advisors on "Part Six. Arts" are dead.  Similarly, 60% of the ''Propædia'' contributors have been dead for 30 years on the average: [[Rene Dubos]] (d. [[1982]]), [[Loren Eiseley]] (d. [[1977]]), [[Harold D. Lasswell]] (d. [[1978]]), [[Mark Van Doren]] (d. [[1972]]), [[Peter Ritchie Calder]] (d. [[1982]]) and [[Mortimer J. Adler]] (d. [[2001]]).<ref name="propedia_authors">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = p.530}}</ref>

===Corporate structure===
In January 1996, the ''Britannica'' was purchased from the [[Benton Foundation]] by [[billionaire]] [[Switzerland|Swiss]] financier  and [[actor]] [[Jacqui Safra]], who serves as its current Chairman of the Board.  In 1997, [[Don Yannias]], a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]]  In 1999, a new company, [[Britannica.com Inc.]] was spun off to develop the digital versions of the ''Britannica''; Yannias assumed the CEO-ship of the new company, while that of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. remained vacant for two years.  Yannias' tenure at [[Britannica.com Inc.]] was marked by missteps, large lay-offs and failures to turn a profit.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Abramson | first = Ronna | date = [[9 April]] [[2001]] | title = Look Under "M" for Mess - Company Business and Marketing | journal = The Industry Standard | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HWW/is_14_4/ai_73746980 | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref>  In 2001, Yannias was replaced by [[Ilan Yeshua]], who reunited the leadership of the two companies;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.charlestonco.com/pressrm/viewpr.cfm?id=92 | title = Press release from Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | date = [[16 May]] [[2001]] | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref> Yannias has returned to investment management, but remains on Britannica's [[Board of Directors]].  

In 2003, the former management consultant [[Jorge Aguilar-Cauz]] was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.  Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the ''Britannica's'' Board of Directors.  Despite his subdued and scholarly manner, Cauz has been aggressively pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the ''Britannica's'' brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] in the mid-1930s.<ref name="propedia_Chair_President">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = p.2}}</ref>

Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial woes, which the company has fought by reducing its price and by drastic cost-cutting measures. According to a 2003 report in the ''[[New York Post]]'', the ''Britannica'' management has eliminated employee [[401(k)]] accounts and encouraged the use of free images; freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and its staff have gone years without raises.<ref>{{cite news | title = Cash-shy Britannica | page = 6 | publisher = [[New York Post]] | date = [[11 September]] [[2003]] | url = http://entertainment.excite.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/09_11_2003_11.html | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref>

[[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] now owns registered [[trademark]]s on the words "Britannica", "Encyclopædia Britannica", "Macropædia", "Micropædia", and "Propædia", as well as its [[thistle]] logo.  It has exercised its trademark rights, as recently as 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2002/d2002-0487.html | title = WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center, Case No. D2002-0487, ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. v. null John Zuccarini, Country Walk'' | accessdate = 2007-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2005/d2005-0865.html | title = WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center, Case No. D2005-0865, ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. v.

==Competition==
The ''Britannica'' is a general [[encyclopedia]], meaning that it seeks to describe as wide a range of topics as possible.  As such, its main competitors are other general encyclopedias; naturally, it can't compete with specialized encyclopedias such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Mathematics]]'' or the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', which can devote much more space to individual topics. 
 
In its first years, the ''Britannica''’s main competitors were the encyclopedias of [[Ephraim Chambers]] and [[Dennis de Coetlogon]] and, later, ''[[Rees's Cyclopaedia]]'' and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Encyclopaedia Metropolitana]]''.  In the twentieth century, its competitors included ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]],'' the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]],'' and the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''.  Each of these encyclopedias had its own strengths and found its own market; some were written with exceptional clarity, others with superb illustrations.  Throughout its history, but especially after the 9th edition, the ''Britannica'' was considered to have the highest authority of any general encyclopedia.<ref name="thomas_1992" />

Since the early 1990s, the ''Britannica'' has faced new challenges from digital information sources.  The Internet has developed into a common source of information for many people, facilitated by the development of search engines.  Online access to reliable original sources and informational/instructional materials has accelerated in recent years with, for example, [[Google Books]], [[MIT]]'s [[MIT OpenCourseWare|release of its educational materials]] and the open [[PubMed Central]] library of the [[National Library of Medicine]].  In general, the Internet tends to provide broader and more current coverage than does the ''Britannica,'' due to the Internet's lower barriers to entry to updating materials.  In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the ''Britannica'' has struggled to keep up-to-date, a problem first analyzed systematically by its former editor [[Walter Yust]].<ref name="EB_1954" />  The ''Britannica's'' pre-eminence has also been challenged by other online encyclopedias, such as ''[[Encarta]]'' and [[Wikipedia]].  

The ''Britannica'''s print version has remained relatively costly compared to most of its competitors, due to its high cost of production, staff and distribution.  The economic viability of [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] in the Internet era rests on its [[brand equity]] and [[product differentiation]], i.e., the public perception that the ''Britannica'' is simply the best encyclopedia available at any price.

===Print encyclopedias===
Comparisons of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' with other print encyclopedias have been published. A well-known comparison is that of [[Kenneth Kister]], who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the ''Britannica'' with two comparable encyclopedias, ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.<ref name="kister_1994"/>  For the ''quantitative'' analysis, ten articles were selected at random ([[circumcision]], [[Charles Drew]], [[Galileo]], [[Philip Glass]], [[heart disease]], [[IQ]], [[panda bear]], [[sexual harassment]], [[shroud of Turin]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) and letter grades (A-D,F) were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency (i.e., timeliness, how up-to-date the article is).   In all four categories and for all three encyclopedias, the four average grades fell between [[grade conversion|B- and B+]], chiefly because not one encyclopedia had an article on [[sexual harassment]] in 1994.  In the accuracy category, the ''Britannica'' received one ''D'' and eight ''A''s. ''Encyclopedia Americana'' received eight ''A''s, and ''Collier's'' received one ''D'' and seven ''A''s; thus, ''Britannica'' received an average score of 92% for accuracy to ''Americana's'' 95% and ''Collier's’'' 92%.  The 1994 ''Britannica'' was faulted for publishing an inflammatory story about [[Charles Drew]] that had long been discredited.  In the timeliness category, ''Britannica'' averaged an 86% to ''Americana's'' 90% and ''Collier's’'' 85%.  A more thorough qualitative comparison of all three encyclopedias caused [[Kenneth Kister|Kister]] to recommend ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' as the superior encyclopedia, primarily on the strength of its excellent writing, balanced presentation and easy navigation.

===Digital encyclopedias on CD/DVD-ROM===
Among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopedias, the most notable competitor of the ''Britannica'' is ''[[Encarta]]'', a modern, multimedia re-working of the [[Funk and Wagnalls]]' print encyclopedia.  Both occupy the same price range, with the 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate CD or DVD costing [[United States dollar|US$]]50<ref name="Britannica Store">{{cite web |url= http://store.britannica.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=765&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=4&iSubCat=14&iProductID=765&show=all|title= The Britannica Store|accessmonthday= November 21|accessyear= 2006}}</ref> and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing [[United States dollar|US$]]45.<ref name="Encarta Store">{{cite web |url= http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-FB7-00442-Encarta-Premium-2007/dp/B000FL2DQS|title= Amazon.com: Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007: Software|accessmonthday= November 21|accessyear= 2006}}</ref> ''Britannica'' contains 100,000 articles, ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus]]'' (U.S. only), as well having Primary and Secondary School editions.<ref name="Britannica Store"/> ''Encarta'' contains 64,000 articles, a U.S. and U.K. dictionary, and a youth edition.<ref name="Encarta Store"/> Like ''Encarta'', the ''Britannica'' has been criticised for being biased towards [[United States]] audiences; for example, the [[United Kingdom]]-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a U.K. dictionary.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=502|title= Encyclopedia face-off: Encarta vs Britannica|accessmonthday= November 21|accessyear= 2006|last= Seymour|first= Ursula|date= 2006-11-09|work= PC Advisor|publisher= IDG}}</ref> The ''Britannica'''s articles are generally regarded as more detailed than those of ''Encarta''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/2-2-2005-65221.asp|title= Battle of the Titans - Encarta vs. the Britannica|accessmonthday= November 21|accessyear= 2006|last= Vaknin|first= Sam|date= 2005-02-02|work= Buzzle.com}}</ref>

===Internet encyclopedias===
Online alternatives to the ''Britannica'' include [[Wikipedia]], a [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based free-content encyclopedia and the largest encyclopedia ever assembled.  The 2007 print version of the ''Britannica'' does not mention Wikipedia, which is covered by other encyclopedias such as the 2006 ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''; however, the online ''Britannica'' does include a 737-word article about Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Dennis | first = Michael Aaron | authorlink = Michael Aaron Dennis | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9433599/Wikipedia | title = Wikipedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref>

A qualitative comparison of the ''Britannica'' and Wikipedia has been published. On December 14, 2005, the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reported that, within 42 randomly selected general science articles, there were 162 mistakes in Wikipedia versus 123 for ''Britannica''.<ref name="Giles_Nature_study_2005">{{cite web

}}</ref> and called for a "prompt" retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a ''Britannica'' year book, and not the encyclopedia; another two were from ''Compton's Encyclopedia'' (called the ''Britannica Student Encyclopedia'' on the company's web site) and yet another reviewer comment refers to an unknown publication. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles. Other articles were merely excerpts, but were penalized for factual omissions. ''Britannica'' cited several facts that were classified as errors by ''Nature'' were minor spelling variations, and that several of its alleged "in-corrections" were merely a different interpretation. ''Nature'' defended its story and declined to retract, stating that as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of Britannica, it used whatever relevant material was available on Britannica's website.<ref>{{cite web

Web traffic is another quantitative metric for comparing the [[customer perceived value|perceived value]] (also called the ''perceived level of [[product differentiation]]'') of two online [[encyclopedia]]s.  Wikipedia receives roughly 450 times more traffic than does the online version of the ''Britannica'' ([http://britannica.com britannica.com]), based on independent page-view statistics gathered by [[Alexa (Internet)|Alexa]] in the first three months of 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=wikipedia.org | title = Web-traffic data for Wikipedia | publisher = [[Alexa (Internet)|Alexa]] | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref>

*vol. = volume
*sup. = supplement
<sup id="editionnote1">1</sup>''Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. With preliminary dissertations on the history of the sciences.''

<sup id="editionnote2">2</sup> 8th to 14th editions included a separate index volume.

<sup id="editionnote3">3</sup> 9th ed. featured articles by notables of the day, such as [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] on [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (who became Lord Kelvin) on [[heat]].

<sup id="editionnote4">4</sup> 10th ed. included a maps volume and a cumulative index volume for the 9th and 10th edition volumes: ''the new volumes, constituting, in combination with the existing volumes of the 9th ed., the 10th ed. ... and also supplying a new, distinctive, and independent library of reference dealing with recent events and developments''

<sup id="editionnote5">5</sup> ''Vols. 30-32 ... the New volumes constituting, in combination with the twenty-nine volumes of the eleventh edition, the twelfth edition''

<sup id="editionnote6">6</sup> This supplement replaced the previous supplement:  ''The three new supplementary volumes constituting, with the volumes of the latest standard edition, the thirteenth edition.''

<sup id="editionnote7">7</sup> This edition was the first to be kept up to date by continual (usually annual) revision.

<sup id="editionnote8">8</sup> The 15th edition (introduced as "Britannica 3") was published as multiple sets: the 10-volume ''Micropædia'' (containing short articles and served as an index), the 19-volume ''Macropædia'', plus the ''Propædia'' (see text). 

<sup id="editionnote9">9</sup> In [[1985]], the system was modified by removing the index function from the ''Micropædia'' and adding a separate two-volume index; the ''Macropædia'' articles were further consolidated into fewer, larger ones (for example, the previously separate articles about the 50 U.S. states were all included into the "United States of America" article), with some medium-length articles moved to the ''Micropædia''. 

The first CD-ROM edition was issued in [[1994]]. At that time also an online version was offered for paid subscription. In [[1999]] this was offered for free, and no revised print versions appeared. The experiment was ended in [[2001]] and a new printed set was issued in [[2002]].
