'''Rhee Taekwon-Do''', also known as '''Rhee Tae Kwon-Do''', '''Rhee Tae Kwon Do''', or '''Rhee Taekwondo''', is a [[martial art]] [[school]] in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] teaching the [[Korea]]n [[art]] of [[taekwon-do]]. The full name is ''Rhee International Taekwon-Do'' with ''(Australia)'' or ''(New Zealand)'' appended. Rhee Taekwon-Do is an independent martial art school, although it was affiliated to the [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] (ITF) in the past. The school has no relation to the [[World Taekwondo Federation]] (WTF).

The founder and head of the school is '''Chong Chul Rhee''', 8th Dan, who holds the title World Master and claims the title '''Father of Australian Taekwon-Do'''.<ref name="Founding">[http://www.rheetkd.com/master_rhee_interview.html An interview with World Master Chong Chul Rhee, 8th Dan, The Father of Australian Taekwon-Do] (Originally from an ''Australasian Fighting Arts'' article in March 1985.)

'''Chong Chul Rhee''' is widely known as '''[[Master Rhee]]'''. He is one of the twelve original masters of taekwon-do<ref name="OriginalMasters">[http://www.itfnz.org.nz/ref/documents/masters.htm A tribute to the original masters] Retrieved on [[13 June]] [[2007]].</ref> selected from the South Korean military to develop taekwon-do under [[Choi Hong Hi|Hong Hi Choi]] in the Korea Taekwon-Do Association (KTA), supported by the [[Republic of Korea]]. The original KTA predated both the ITF and the WTF,<ref name="KTA">Kim, S. J. (2006): [http://www.sjkim-taekwondo.com/History.html History of Taekwondo] Retrieved on [[28 July]] [[2007]].</ref> which were founded in 1966 and 1973, respectively. Rhee was an unarmed combat instructor in the Korean Marines, and spent some time in [[Southeast Asia]] helping to introduce taekwon-do there (notably in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]) before becoming the first taekwon-do master sent to Australia by the Republic of Korea.

Rhee has worked towards the [[Korean reunification|reunification of Korea]], serving as a member during the third through the ninth terms and as Chairman for the eighth term of the Oceania Division of the Advisory Council for Democratic and Peaceful Unification.<ref name="ODCC">[http://www.acdpuoceania.com/formal_chairman_e.html Former Chairmen of the ODCC] Retrieved on [[24 April]] [[2003]]; link has expired, as at [[15 July]] [[2007]].</ref> In 2003, the Republic of Korea awarded Rhee the [[Dongbaeg Medal]] (''[[Hangul|동백장]]'') for promoting taekwon-do and Korean culture over 33 years.<ref name="SydneyKoreanHerald"/> He has also served as Chairman of the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympics]] Supporting Committee and founding President of the Korean Community Hall Construction Supporting Committee.<ref name="ODCC"/>

Two of Rhee's brothers also hold the title of Master in Rhee Taekwon-Do, and assist him in managing parts of the school:

* '''Chong Hyup Rhee''', 7th Dan, is based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and is also one of the original masters of taekwon-do.<ref name="OriginalMasters"/> He is the figure on the right in the Rhee Taekwon-Do logo.
* '''Chong Yoon Rhee''', 7th Dan, is based in [[New South Wales]] and was a South Korean army officer.

The title of Master in Rhee Taekwon-Do is also held by [http://www.martialarm.com/martial-arts-articles/Dynamic_Korean_Art.html Vernon Low], who is in charge of the school's South Australian operations and is known as C. C. Rhee's number one student.

== Three claims ==

Rhee has made three key claims: (1) Rhee is the Father of Australian Taekwon-Do, (2) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the first taekwon-do school in Australia, and (3) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the biggest taekwon-do school in Australia. These claims have been widely publicised throughout Australia since at least the [[1980s]].

=== Father of Australian Taekwon-Do ===

No one has publicly challenged Rhee's claim as the Father of Australian Taekwon-Do. This claim might be a point of academic debate, however, based on claims made concerning four other masters:

# '''Chan Yong Kim''', 9th Dan, came to Australia in either 1961<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky">Ta'kody, J. (2001): "Jack Rozinsky: The art of a lifetime", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 10(1):8-11.</ref> or 1963<ref name="Kim1">[http://www.nostaekwondo.com.au/taekwondo.htm No's Taekwondo] Retrieved on [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="Kim2">Stone, B. (2003): "Man of honour: Master Ke Hyung No", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 12(3):14-17.</ref> (sponsored by either the [[Silvertop Karate Club]]<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky"/> or the [[Australian Judo Federation]]<ref name="Kim3">[http://www.thackreytkd.com/chanyongkim.shtml Biography of Grandmaster Chan-Yong Kim] Retrieved on [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref>), was the first martial art instructor to teach taekwon-do in Australia, and stayed for one or two years before relocating to the [[United States of America|USA]], according to Jack Rozinsky and Ke Hyung No. Rozinsky claims to have founded the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre in 1963,<ref name="Rozinsky1">Rozinsky, J. (1996): "Fighting frames", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 4(4):53.</ref> which would make a 1963 arrival by Kim unlikely. In any case, Kim would have taught taekwon-do in Australia before Rhee, and so might lay claim to the title.
# '''Jack Rozinsky''', 9th Dan ([[Jidokwan]]), might himself lay claim to the title based on a 1963 founding year for his school,<ref name="Rozinsky1"/> which would make him the first taekwon-do school founder in Australia.
# '''Terence Walsh''', 8th Dan ([[World Kido Federation]]), claimed to have introduced taekwon-do to the state of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, in 1969.<ref name="Walsh1">Walsh, T. F. (1999): "Grandmaster Kwang Sung Hang: Taekwondo pioneer", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 8(3):48-50.</ref><ref name="Walsh2">[http://www.walshtkd.com/ Walsh Martial Arts Australia] Retrieved on [[14 June]] [[2007]].</ref> If he was the first to introduce taekwon-do to Australia's largest population centre, then he might lay claim to the title.
# '''Young Ku Yun''', 8th Dan (ITF), has been described by ''Australasian Taekwondo'' magazine as having introduced taekwon-do to [[Sydney]], New South Wales, in 1971.<ref name="Yun1">Anon. (1997): "Grandmaster Yun: The changing face of martial arts", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 6(2):9-12.</ref> This would contradict Walsh's claim. If Yun was the first to introduce taekwon-do to Australia's largest population centre, then he might lay claim to the title.

Kim would have been in the lower Dan ranks, and would not yet have held the title of Master, when he was invited to teach in Australia. Rozinsky and Walsh held 1st Dan ranking in the 1960s. Both Rhee (KTA) and Yun (ITF) would have been in the middle Dan ranks and held the title of Master when they arrived, as they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.

[[Image:070616-Janggeom-Ladies.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ladies' training session being conducted by a senior Rhee Taekwon-Do instructor]]

Rhee's claim as the Father of Australian Taekwon-Do would be supported by the facts that:

# Kim was in Australia for only one or two years<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky"/><ref name="Kim3"/> and did not establish a taekwon-do school, but taught within another school.<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky"/><ref name="Kim1"/><ref name="Kim2"/><ref name="Kim3"/> He was the first taekwon-do instructor in Australia, but did not introduce the martial art outside Victoria.
# Rozinsky's school exists only in Victoria.<ref name="Rozinsky2">[http://www.taekwondo.com.au/branches.asp Melbourne Taekwondo Centre branches] Retrieved on [[21 June]] [[2007]].</ref> He was the first taekwon-do school founder in Australia, but did not introduce the martial art outside Victoria.
# Walsh founded his school after Rhee Taekwon-Do had already been established, and his school exists only in the eastern states of Australia.<ref name="Walsh2"/> He might be the first to have introduced taekwon-do to Australia's largest population centre, but it is unclear whether Yun might claim this distinction instead. Walsh did not introduce the martial art outside the eastern states.
# Yun arrived in Australia around five years after Rhee, and himself claimed to be the first ''ITF'' taekwon-do instructor in Australia<ref name="Yun2">[http://www.yunjungdo.com.au/ Yun Jung Do] Retrieved on [[21 June]] [[2007]].</ref> rather than the first taekwon-do instructor in Australia. He might be the first to have introduced taekwon-do to Australia's largest population centre, but it is unclear whether Walsh might claim this distinction instead.

=== First Taekwon-Do school in Australia ===

Based on a 1963 founding year for the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre,<ref name="Rozinsky1"/> Rhee Taekwon-Do was not chronologically the first taekwon-do school in Australia. Rhee's school was, however, the first ''nation-wide'' taekwon-do school in Australia, having operated in South Australia from at least 1967, Western Australia from at least 1970, Victoria from at least 1971, New South Wales from at least 1974, Queensland from at least 1976, and Tasmania from at least 1983.

=== Biggest Taekwon-Do school in Australia ===

Rhee Taekwon-Do's claim as the biggest taekwon-do school in Australia might be disputed if one considers the Australian member schools of the ITF and the WTF as unified organisations. This is itself debatable, since Rhee Taekwon-Do is a school under the direct leadership of Rhee while the ITF and WTF consist of groups of schools under democratic leadership. Rhee Taekwon-Do's claim to be the biggest taekwon-do school in Australia would be supported by independently-verifiable listings of dojang.<ref name="YellowPages"/><ref name="NationalListing"/>

== Ex-Rhee members ==

The founders of several Australian martial art schools (and at least one school in New Zealand) received their foundational taekwon-do training in Rhee Taekwon-Do or were themselves past instructors in Rhee's school. In approximate chronological order of their involvement in Rhee Taekwon-Do:

Of these ex-Rhee members, the highest-ranked would have been Rhee Taekwon-Do 3rd Dan instructors, with around 20 to 25 years' training in Rhee Taekwon-Do.

== Training ==

[[Image:070617-Janggeom-Drill.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Rhee Taekwon-Do self-defence drill to practise deflecting an incoming punch aimed at the face]]

Rhee Taekwon-Do training involves a variety of exercises. Classes begin (and end) with bowing as a sign of respect. Warm-up exercises prepare the body for practising physical techniques, and are also a means for developing strength and fitness. Basic drills involving synchronised group practice are a fundamental part of Rhee Taekwon-Do training, as in many traditional martial arts. [[Hyung]] practice is another element of training that marks Rhee Taekwon-Do as a traditional martial art, with students practising set sequences of techniques.

Extensive destruction (breaking) training using pine boards, clay tiles, and bricks are employed throughout the different ranks to develop focus, power, and correct technique. Members typically attempt breaking techniques under formal supervision and after considerable training.

[[Sparring]] in Rhee Taekwon-Do is different to that in [[sport]]-style taekwondo schools, such as those of the WTF. Instead of a points-based system while wearing body [[armour]], the sparring is unscored, unarmoured, and non-contact as is the traditional taekwon-do way. Non-contact in Rhee Taekwon-Do is achieved primarily by the defender actively avoiding, blocking, or otherwise neutralising an incoming attack. An alternative definition of non-contact is that while attacks are executed with full power and speed, they are stopped just short of the training partner's body.

== Ranks ==

[[Image:070616-Janggeom-Tiles.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A twin knife-hand strike into two stacks of roof tiles as part of a Rhee Taekwon-Do 2nd Dan grading test]]

Ranks in Rhee Taekwon-Do, as in many other martial art schools, are denoted by different coloured belts. These give an indication of a member's stage of learning and level of responsibility within the school. Students start with white belts and progress through yellow, green, blue, brown, and then black. In general, a darker colour indicates a more senior rank. In Rhee Taekwon-Do, as in most traditional martial art schools, [[Rank|rank]] does not depend solely on physical or technical prowess.

There are ten coloured belt grades ([[Kup rank]]s; ''[[Hangul|급]]'') and nine black belt degrees ([[Dan rank]]s; ''[[Hangul|단]]''). Tips denoting odd-numbered Kup ranks are represented by a stripe of the higher colour on the right end (as seen from the wearer's point of view) of a belt of the lower colour. Dan ranks are represented by a white bar (or bars) embroidered on the black belt. A black belt without a bar is a Junior Black Belt, a degree given to members considered too young for a 1st Dan.

To attain the rank of Rhee Taekwon-Do 1st Dan typically takes four to five years of training from commencement. Promotion through the Dan ranks in Rhee Taekwon-Do is by invitation,<ref name="Craig">Anon. (2006): Juliette presented with high honour from World Master, ''Maryborough Herald'' (10 May 2006), p. 21.</ref> and is normally slower than in most other taekwon-do schools. Promotion to 2nd Dan might come after 10 to 15 years of training, in which time a student could have reached 4th Dan (ITF)<ref name="Choi">Choi, H. H. (1993): ''Taekwon-Do – The Korean art of self-defence, 3rd ed.'' (Vol. 1, p. 94). Mississauga: International Taekwon-Do Federation.</ref> or 5th Dan (WTF).<ref name="Kukkiwon">[http://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/english/examination/examination08.jsp?div=01 Kukkiwon promotion test regulations (Article 8)] Retrieved on [[19 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Promotion to 3rd Dan might come after 20 to 25 years of training, which in terms of time alone would be equivalent to 6th Dan (ITF)<ref name="Choi"/> or 7th Dan (WTF).<ref name="Kukkiwon"/>
