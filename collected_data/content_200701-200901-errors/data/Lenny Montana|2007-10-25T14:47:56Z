'''Lenny Montana''' (born '''Leonardo Passofaro''') ([[March 13]], [[1926]] â€“ [[May 12]], [[1992]]) was an [[USA|American]] [[actor]]. <!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LucaBrasiComp.jpg|thumb|Lenny Montana meeting his end as Luca Brasi]] -->

He was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in [[1926]] of [[Italian American]] heritage.  Prior to becoming an actor, Montana was a [[professional wrestler]] and a [[mobster]].

Montana's first film appearance is probably his most memorable. He played the bodyguard [[Luca Brasi]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' and despite relatively little on-screen time his performance was quite memorable. Brasi, according to [[Mario Puzo]]'s novel on which the film is based, is the one man whom his boss Don Corleone fears.

He starred in a number of other movies such as ''[[The Jerk]]'' (1979) and alongside [[Jackie Chan]] in ''[[The Big Brawl]]'' (1980), but retired after making his final movie, ''[[Blood Song]]'', in 1982.

Montana died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1992, 66 years of age.
