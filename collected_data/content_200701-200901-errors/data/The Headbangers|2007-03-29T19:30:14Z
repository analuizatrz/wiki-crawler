'''The Headbangers''' were the [[tag team]] of [[Charles Warrington|Mosh]] and [[Glen Ruth|Thrasher]] whose most notable matches were in the World Wrestling Federation. As the name of the team implied, their [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] was that they were a pair of [[headbanging|headbangers]], complete with [[Heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] related T-shirts and piercings.

The team first debuted on WWF TV as the '''Sisters of Love''', proteges of manager [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] who dressed as [[nun]]s. The gimmick was short-lived, but they kept the skirts when they became the Headbangers, and later had [[T-shirt]]s with the words, "Real men wear skirts." They were both playable characters in ''[[WWF Warzone]]'' and ''[[WWF Attitude]]''. The teams only major success came when the won the [[World Tag Team Championships]]. Neither [[Charles Warrington|Mosh]] nor [[Glen Ruth|Thrasher]] is involved in the [[WWE]] anymore.
