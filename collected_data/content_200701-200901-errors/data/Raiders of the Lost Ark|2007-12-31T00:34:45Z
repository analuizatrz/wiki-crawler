'''''Raiders of the Lost Ark''''', also known as '''''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark''''', is a [[1981 in film|1981]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], produced by [[George Lucas]] and starring [[Harrison Ford]]. It is the first in the [[Indiana Jones]] film and television series, and [[List of Indiana Jones appearances|the twenty-fourth in internal chronology]]. In the film, the [[Nazis]] are searching for the lost [[Ark of the Covenant]] to make their army invincible, as it did for the Israelites of the Old Testament, and it is up to [[archaeology|archaeologist]] and adventurer Indiana Jones to find it first. 

When released on [[June 12]], [[1981]], the $20 million (USD) film was a huge success, easily the highest grossing film of 1981, earning $384 million worldwide, and, at the time, one of the highest-grossing movies ever made. It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture, in 1982 and won four (Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration). The film was a hit with audiences and critics alike leading to two more films, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' television series, and a fourth film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', in production for release in [[2008]].

==Plot==
In 1936, in the [[Peru]]vian [[jungle]], archaeologist/treasure hunter Indiana Jones braves several booby traps to retrieve a golden idol from an ancient temple. After escaping, he finds rival archaeologist [[Rene Belloq]] waiting outside with a group of Hovitos, the local natives. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones is forced to give up the artifact to Belloq. Jones manages to escape from Belloq and the Hovitos by flying away on a waiting [[seaplane]]. [[Image:Indianagrabsidol.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Indiana Jones attempts to take the idol in the opening of the film.]]

At the American college where he teaches archaeology, Jones meets with two Army intelligence agents. They explain that the [[Nazi]]s, in their quest to gain occult power, are searching for Abner Ravenwood, Jones’s former mentor. Ravenwood is the foremost expert on the [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], which has been rediscovered by the Nazis and is believed to be the location of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], a chest the Israelites built to hold the [[Ten Commandments]]. Jones surmises that the Nazis seek Ravenwood because he possesses the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, a key artifact which is essential in calculating the Ark’s resting place. His colleague [[Marcus Brody]] explains that, according to legend, the power of the Ark can make any army invincible.

Jones flies to [[Nepal]], only to find that Ravenwood has died; his daughter [[Marion Ravenwood|Marion]], Jones's embittered former lover, has the headpiece, which she wears as a medallion. As a result of a gunfight between Jones and a sadistic [[Nazi]] agent named [[Toht]], Marion's tavern is burned down. Toht's hand is scarred with the face of the medallion, whereas Jones ends up in possession of both the headpiece and Marion, who decides to travel with him. The two fly to [[Cairo]] and meet up with [[Sallah]], a skilled Egyptian digger, who says that he knows where the Nazis, with the assistance of Belloq, are digging for the Ark. Nazi operatives kidnap Marion and fake her death in front of Jones. That evening, Sallah and Jones decipher the carvings on the headpiece. Based on their translation, they realize the Nazis used the wrong length for the Staff of [[Ra]], and are digging in the wrong place.
[[Image:IndySallahArk.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Indiana and Sallah lift up the Ark of the Covenant]]
Infiltrating the dig, Indy sneaks into the map room, which contains a complete to-scale model of the city of Tanis. According to legend, the headpiece would reveal the exact location of the [[Well of Souls]], the actual chamber containing the Ark, by focusing daylight onto the city mock-up at a certain time of day. Although Sallah is nearly exposed and captured in the attempt, Indy successfully acquires the location. He and Sallah gather a small crew and begin to dig at the correct location. After several hours, they break through the roof of the buried Well of Souls. Jones is lowered to the floor of the temple and finds it infested with multitudes of poisonious snakes, of which he is deathly afraid. After he and Sallah hoist the Ark out of the temple, Belloq and the Nazis appear and take control of the Ark. Marion is tossed into the Well with Jones, and they are sealed in. The duo manage to escape, emerging aboveground in time to find a [[Luftwaffe]] [[flying wing]] being prepared to transport the Ark to [[Berlin]]. They accidentally blow up the plane, therefore the Ark is put on a [[truck]] to Cairo, where it will be shipped to Berlin. Stealing a [[horse]], Jones pursues the convoy escorting the truck, seizes control of the vehicle, and, after an extended pursuit, escapes with the Ark. That evening, Jones and Marion leave Sallah to escort the Ark to [[England]] onboard the [[tramp steamer]] ''Bantu Wind''.

The next morning, a Nazi [[U-boat]] commanded by Belloq and Nazi officer Dietrich stops the ship. Marion and the Ark are removed, while Jones covertly boards the U-boat. He follows Belloq and the Ark to an isolated island, where they plan to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to the Führer. Threatening to destroy the Ark with a rocket launcher, Jones demands that the Nazis free Marion. Belloq calls his bluff, claiming that Indy, as an archaeologist, wants to see it opened as badly as Belloq; Jones is forced to surrender. Marion and Jones are tied up while Belloq and the Nazis perform a ceremonial opening of the Ark. Spirits emerge from within; Jones, aware of the supernatural danger of looking at the open Ark, warns Marion to close her eyes. The group of Nazis, who do not look away, are destroyed in the Ark's awesome display, and the Ark closes itself once more with a crack of thunder. Back in [[Washington, D.C.]], the two Army intelligence men tell a suspicious Jones that "top men" are carefully studying the Ark. In reality, the artifact is sealed in a wooden crate and stored in a giant [[Government Warehouse|government warehouse]], filled with countless similar crates.

==Development==
In [[1973]], [[George Lucas]] wrote ''The Adventures of Indiana Smith''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Marcus Hearn| title =The Cinema of George Lucas| publisher =Harry N. Abrams Inc, Publishers| date =2005| location =[[New York]]| pages =80 | id =ISBN 0-8109-4968-7}}</ref> Like ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]],'' it was an opportunity to create a modern version of the [[movie serial|serials]] of the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name="makingthetrilogy">{{cite video|title=Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy|format=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|year=2003}}</ref> Lucas discussed the concept with [[Philip Kaufman]], who worked with him for several weeks and came up with the [[Ark of the Covenant]] as the [[plot device]]. The project was stalled when [[Clint Eastwood]] hired Kaufman to direct ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]''.<ref name="smith">Hearn, p.112-115</ref> In late May 1977, Lucas was in [[Maui]], trying to escape the enormous success of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''. Friend and colleague [[Steven Spielberg]] was also there, holidaying from work on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''. While building a sand castle, Spielberg expressed an interest in directing a [[James Bond]] film. Lucas convinced his friend Spielberg that he had conceived a character "better than James Bond" and explained the concept of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. Spielberg loved it, calling it "a James Bond film without the hardware",<ref name="mcbride">{{cite book | last = McBride | first =Joseph | authorlink =Joseph McBride | title = Steven Spielberg | publisher =Faber and Faber | date =1997 | location =[[New York City]] | pages =309-322 | id = ISBN 0-571-19177-0 |chapter=Rehab}}</ref> though he had the character's [[surname]] changed to "[[Jones (surname)|Jones]]".<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

The following year, Lucas focused on developing ''Raiders'' and the ''Star Wars'' sequel ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', during which [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[Frank Marshall (movie producer)|Frank Marshall]] joined the project as screenwriter and producer respectively. Between [[January 23]]-[[January 27]], [[1978]] for nine hours a day, Lucas, Kasdan and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas. Spielberg came up with Jones being chased by a boulder, <ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> and Lucas came up with a submarine, a monkey giving the [[Nazi salute]], and a girl slugging Jones in [[Nepal]].<ref name="mcbride"/> Kasdan used a 100 page transcript of their conversations for his first script draft,<ref>Hearn, p.122-123</ref> working for six months.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Ultimately some of their ideas were too grand and had to be cut: a mine chase,<ref>Script [http://www.movie-page.com/scripts/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark.html 3rd Draft], scene 45-47</ref> an escape in [[Shanghai]] using a rolling gong as a shield,<ref>Script [http://www.movie-page.com/scripts/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark.html 3rd Draft], scene 148-155</ref> and a jump from an airplane in a raft, all of which made it into the sequel.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

Spielberg and Lucas disagreed on the character: although Lucas saw him as a Bondian playboy, Kasdan and Spielberg felt the professor and adventurer elements of the character made him complex enough. Spielberg had darker visions of Jones, interpreting him as an [[alcoholic]] similar to [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character Fred C. Dobbs in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''. This characterization fell away during the later drafts.<ref name="mcbride"/> Spielberg also initially conceived of Toht with a robotic arm, which Lucas rejected as falling into science-fiction. Comic book artist [[Jim Steranko]] was also commissioned to produce original illustrations for pre-production, which heavily influenced Spielberg's decisions in both the look of the film and the character of Indiana Jones himself.<ref name="twenty-five">{{cite news | title = Raiders Of The Lost Ark | pages = 72-82 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2006-09-29]]}}</ref>

As ''The Empire Strikes Back'' began post-production in September 1979, Lucas began to find a [[distribution]] deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.<ref name="lucas prod">Hearn, p.127-134</ref> Studios were reluctant following Spielberg's flop ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', unable to believe he could bring the film for $20 million which they would have to pay for.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> They also balked at simply distributing the film while the filmmakers took a larger share of box office receipts<ref name="lucas prod"/> and full ownership of the film.<ref name="mcbride"/> Despite a concern that the first sequence alone would cost $20 million,<ref>{{cite news | title = Raiders Opening Salvo | pages = 75 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2006-09-29]]}}</ref> [[Paramount Pictures]] under [[Michael Eisner]] accepted<ref name="lucas prod"/> on condition of making at least four sequels with [[Lucasfilm]].<ref name="mcbride"/> By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at [[Elstree Studios]], with Lucas trying to keep costs down.<ref name="lucas prod"/> With four illustrators, ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' was Spielberg's most [[storyboard]]ed film of his career to date, further helping the film economically, and he and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to stylistically follow the "quick and dirty" feel of the Saturday matinée serials.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

==Production==
Filming began on [[June 23]], [[1980]] at [[La Rochelle]], [[France]], for scenes involving the Nazi submarine,<ref name="lucas prod"/> which was rented from the movie ''[[Das Boot]]''. The U-boat pen was a genuine one that had survived from [[World War II]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> The crew moved to [[Elstree Studios]]<ref name="lucas prod"/> for scenes involving the [[Well of Souls]], the interiors of the temple in the opening sequence and [[Marion Ravenwood]]'s bar.<ref name="world">{{cite web|author=Marco Fromter|title=Around the World with Indiana Jones|publisher=Official Website|date=[[2006-08-18]]|url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060818/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The Well of Souls required 7000 snakes, though the only poisonous snakes on set were the [[cobras]]. However, one crew member was bitten by a python on set.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> To shoot the scene where Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a glass sheet was put between Ford and the animal, partially visible when the light hits it at a certain [[angle]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Unlike the character he portrayed, Ford does not actually have a fear of snakes; Spielberg was not afraid either, but seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him "want to puke".<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> The opening sequence featured live [[tarantulas]]: [[Alfred Molina]] had to have many put on him, but they did not move until a female was placed there. Molina found the experience creepy. A [[fibreglass]] boulder 22 feet in diameter was made for the scene where Indiana escapes the temple, but Spielberg rejected it and had it made 50 feet (15.2 m) larger.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

All of the scenes set in [[Egypt]] and the canyon where Indiana threatens to blow up the Ark were filmed in [[Tunisia]]; many of the locations were repeated from ''Star Wars'', since many people in the location crew were the same for both films.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Notably, that canyon was the exact same location wherein [[R2-D2]] was attacked by [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Jawa|Jawas]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>  Filming there was a harsh experience due to the [[heat]] and [[disease]]. Several members of the cast & crew fell ill; Rhys-Davies in particular [[Defecation|defecated]] in his costume during one shot.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>  Spielberg was never ill, as he only ate tinned foods from England.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Spielberg did not like the area and quickly pushed forward a scheduled six-week shoot to four-and-a-half weeks. Much was improvised there: the scene wherein Marion puts on her dress and attempts to leave Belloq's tent was improvised, as was the entire plane fight. During shooting of that scene, Ford tore his [[cruciate ligament]] in his left leg as a wheel went over his knee, but he did not accept medical help and simply put [[ice]] over it.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> The fight scenes in the town were filmed in [[Kairouan]]; by then Ford was suffering from [[dysentery]]. He had enough, and did not want to shoot a fight scene between Indiana and a swordsman. He said to Spielberg "Why don't we just shoot the sucker?" Spielberg agreed, scrapped the rest of the fight scene, and filmed the gag of Indiana quickly shooting the swordsman.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Urban Legends of Indiana Jones|publisher=Official website|date=[[2004-01-13]]|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612222640/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20040113/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The truck chase was shot entirely by the second-unit who mostly followed Spielberg's storyboards, though they decided to add Indiana being dragged by the truck. Spielberg shot all the close-ups with Ford afterwards.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

The interior staircase set in [[Washington, D.C.]] was filmed inside of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]]. The [[University of the Pacific]], located in [[Stockton, California]], stands in for the college where Jones works, and his home exteriors were filmed in the city of [[San Rafael, California]].<ref name="world"/> The opening exteriors were filmed in [[Kauai, Hawaii]], with Spielberg wrapping in September, finishing under schedule in 73 days, in contrast to his previous film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''.<ref name="mcbride"/><ref name="lucas prod"/> The Washington, D.C. exterior was a pick-up, as the film was originally written to end without any resolution of Indy's relationship to Marion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twenty-Five Reasons to Watch Raiders Again|publisher=Official website|date=[[2006-06-12]]|url=hhttp://web.archive.org/web/20070610051833/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060612/indexp4.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>

Special effects were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]]. These largely featured in the climactic sequence wherein the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was opened and spirits come out to attack the Nazis. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a wax model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. To avoid an [[R rating]], fire was double exposed over Belloq's exploding head. The spirits were shot underwater for a ghostly look.<ref name="magic">{{cite video | title = The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones | format = DVD | publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] | year = 2003}}</ref> [[Ben Burtt]] was sound effects supervisor, picking a [[30-30 Winchester]] rifle for the sound of Jones' gun; for the various punching noises throughout the film, leather jackets and baseball gloves were whacked by a baseball bat to continue the [[comic-book]]ish feel of the film. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, cheese casserole and sponges were used for the slithering, while lifting a toilet tank was used for the sound of opening the Ark. Burtt used a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed dolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within.<ref>{{cite video | title = The Sound of Indiana Jones | format = DVD | publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] | year = 2003}}</ref>

==Cast==
*'''[[Harrison Ford]]''' stars as '''[[Indiana Jones]]''', an adventurous archaeology professor, who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones initially claim he has no belief in the supernatural, only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark. Spielberg suggested casting [[Harrison Ford]] as Jones, but Lucas objected, stating that he didn't want Ford to become his "[[Robert De Niro|Bobby De Niro]]" or "that guy I put in all my movies", a reference to [[Martin Scorsese]], who often worked with De Niro.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Desiring a lesser known actor, Lucas persuaded Spielberg to help him search for a new talent. Among the actors who auditioned were [[Tim Matheson]], [[Peter Coyote]], and [[Tom Selleck]]. Selleck was originally cast in the role, but he was unavailable for the part because of his commitment to the television series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> In June 1980, three weeks away from filming,<ref name="facts and trivia">{{cite web|title=Facts and trivia of the Lost Ark|publisher=Official website|date=[[2003-10-14]]|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070518230319/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/news20031014.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Spielberg persuaded Lucas to cast Ford after producers Marshall and [[Kathleen Kennedy (movie producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] were impressed by his performance as [[Han Solo]] in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref name="lucas prod"/>
   
*'''[[Karen Allen]]''' plays '''[[Marion Ravenwood]]''', a spirited, tough old flame of Indiana. She is the daughter of Abner Ravenwood, Indiana Jones' mentor, and owns a bar in Nepal. Allen was after auditioning with Matheson and [[John Shea]]. Spielberg was interested in her, as he had seen her performance in ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]''. [[Sean Young]] had previously auditioned for the part. 

*'''[[John Rhys-Davies]]''' as '''[[Sallah]]'''. Sallah is "the best digger in Egypt", and has been hired by the Nazis to help them excavate Tanis. Although he is suspicious of the Ark's power, he is an old friend of Indiana Jones, and agrees to help him obtain the Ark. Initially, Spielberg approached [[Danny DeVito]] to play Sallah, but could not play the part due to scheduling conflicts. Spielberg cast Rhys-Davies after seeing his performance in ''[[Shōgun (TV miniseries)|Shogun]]''.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

*'''[[Denholm Elliott]]''' as '''[[Marcus Brody]]'''. Marcus is a museum curator, and buys whatever artifacts Indiana obtains for display in his museum. The US governmental agents approach him in regards to recovering the Ark, and he sets up a meeting between them and Indiana Jones. Spielberg hired Elliott as he was a big fan of him.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

[[Image:Castphoto.JPG|thumb|285px|The main villains (from left to right): [[Colonel Dietrich]] ([[Wolf Kahler]]), [[Rene Belloq]] ([[Paul Freeman]]), and [[Arnold Toht]] ([[Ronald Lacey]]).]]
*'''[[Paul Freeman]]''' as '''Rene Belloq'''. Jones' arch nemesis, Belloq is also an archaeologist after the Ark, but he is working for the Nazis. He intends to harness the power of the Ark himself before [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] could, but he is killed by the supernatural powers of the Ark after opening it.

*'''[[Ronald Lacey]]''' as '''[[Toht|Arnold Toht]]'''. Toht is an interrogator for the Nazis, who tries to torture Marion Ravenwood for the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. He only manages to obtain one side of it through a burn in his hand. He is killed by the supernatural powers of the Ark. Lacey was cast as he reminded Spielberg of [[Peter Lorre]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

*'''[[Wolf Kahler]]''' as '''Colonel Dietrich'''. Dietrich is a ruthless Nazi officer leading the operation to secure the Ark. He is killed by the supernatural powers of the Ark.

*'''[[Alfred Molina]]''' as '''Satipo'''. Satipo is one of Jones's guides through the South American jungle. He betrays Jones and steals the golden idol, but is killed by one of the traps in the temple.

Producer [[Frank Marshall (movie producer)|Frank Marshall]] played a pilot in the airplane fight sequence. The stunt team was ill, so he took the role instead. The result was three days in a cockpit that was over 140 degrees.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> [[Pat Roach]] plays the large mechanic with whom Jones brawls in this sequence, as well as Toht's henchman in Marion's bar. He had the rare opportunity to be killed twice in one movie. <ref>{{cite video | title = The Stunts of Indiana Jones | format = DVD | publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] | year = 2003}}</ref> Special-effects supervisor [[Dennis Muren]] cameoed on the plane Indiana Jones takes to [[Nepal]].<ref name="magic"/>

''Raiders of the Lost Ark'''s score is most notable for featuring the rousing and iconic composition "The Raiders March" that came to symbolize Indiana Jones. The tune was composed by [[John Williams]]. The score also featured three other prominent themes: the grand yet mysterious "Ark Theme", a theme associated with Marion, and the loud, pompous Nazi March, which harkens back to 1940s film scores. The score had received an Oscar nomination for best original score, but lost to [[Vangelis]]'s electro-synth based score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. John Williams composed the march in the two separate segments. When he played them for Steven Spielberg he told Williams that he liked them both, which led to the combined theme people know today.<ref>{{cite video|people=[[John Williams]]|title=The Music of Indiana Jones|format=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|year=2003}}</ref>

Following the box office success of ''Raiders'', two more feature films were produced: ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel, and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Another sequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', is currently in production. A TV series, entitled ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', was also spun off from this film, and details the early years of the character. Numerous other books, comics, and video games have also been produced.

In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed the film at number 60 on its top 100 films of the first century of cinema. In 1999, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. Indiana Jones has become an icon, being listed as ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s third favorite action hero, while noting "some of the greatest action scenes ever filmed are strung together like pearls" in this film.<ref>{{cite news | author = Marc Bernadin | title = 25 Awesome Action Heroes | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2007-10-23]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20041669_20041686_20153598_22,00.html | accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>

An amateur shot-for-shot remake was made by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb, then children in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]]. It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982-1989. After production of the film, called ''Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation'', wrapped in 1989, it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, where it was discovered by [[Eli Roth]]<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Harry Knowles]]|title=RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK shot-for-shot teenage remake review!!!|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=[[2003-05-31]]|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=15348|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> and acclaimed by Spielberg himself<ref>{{cite web|title=Quotes on The Adaptation|publisher=The Indy Experience|url=http://www.theindyexperience.com/raiders_adaptation/raiders_adaptation_press.php|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said he looked forward to seeing their names on the big screen.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sarah Hepola|title=Lost Ark Resurrected|publisher=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=[[2003-05-30]]|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2003-05-30/screens_feature4.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] have purchased the trio's life rights and will be producing a film based on their adventures making their remake.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Harry Knowles]]|title=Sometimes, The Good Guys Win!!!

== Video games ==
The only [[video game]] based exclusively on this movie is ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (Atari 2600)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', released in 1982 by [[Atari]] for their [[Atari 2600]] console.

The first third of the video game ''[[Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures]]'', released in 1994 by JVC for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], is based entirely on the film. Several sequences from the film are reproduced (the boulder run and the showdown with the Cairo Swordsman among them); however, several inconsistencies with the film are present in the game, such as Nazi soldiers and bats being present in the Well of Souls sequence, for example. The game was developed by [[LucasArts]] and [[Factor 5]].

In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'' a bonus level brings Indy back to 'Peru, South America' from this movie. He can explore the cave and he discovers another hidden        idol.

==Releases==
The film was released on [[VHS]] in [[pan and scan]] only and on [[laserdisc]] in both pan and scan and [[widescreen]]. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in [[THX]] and for the first time was made available in widescreen. The outer package was retitled ''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark'' to correlate with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent [[DVD]] release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print.
