The '''Ogle County Courthouse''' is a [[National Register of Historic Places|Registered Historic Place]] in the [[Ogle County, Illinois]] county seat of [[Oregon, Illinois|Oregon]]. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county, its successor is located directly across the street. It is one of six Oregon sites listed on the Register. Some of Oregon's other Registered Historic Places include the [[Oregon Commercial Historic District]], the [[Pinehill Inn]] and [[Chana School]]. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981.

==History==
The current structure, no longer in use as the judiciary center in Ogle County, was constructed in late 1890 and early 1891 at a cost of $107,000.<ref name=or>[http://www.oregonil.com/attractions-courthouse.html Ogle County Courthouse], Attractions, City of Oregon. Retrieved 1 February 2007.</ref> The basically square Romanesque Revival structure is topped with a [[cupola]] and features a full basement. It was designed by Chicago architect [[George O. Garnsey]].<ref name=nrhp2>[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200340.pdf National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form], ([[PDF]]) Ogle County Courthouse, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

===First courthouse===
The first courthouse was completed in 1840-1841 but never saw use.<ref name=nrhp2/> The 1840-41 courthouse was constructed at a cost of $4,000, partially in direct response to "harassment by a gang of [[villain]]s" that some of the citizens of Ogle County had reportedly been experiencing.<ref name=nrhp/> On March 21, 1841, the night before court convened in its new building, the bandits allegedly set the courthouse on fire, completely destroying it. The town, whipped into a fury by horse whipping and thievery and, even murder, formed a band of "Regulators" to hunt down and bring the [[bandit]]s to justice. Essentially [[vigilante]]s the group tracked down two residents, "Old Man Driskell" and his son, William Driskell, whom were suspected of the murder.<ref name=nrhp/> The Driskells were arrested and brought to Oregon by the Regulators who organized a trial at a nearby mill. The defendants were provided with counsel and a trial ensued, which residents involved called "fair" at the time.<ref name=nrhp/>

The trial was anything but fair. Both men were immediately executed. One Driskell, led out alone, was shot first. Then the other was led out, shown his dead relative's body and pushed for a confession. The defendant refused to confess, though he reportedly said he had committed other crimes for which he derserved death, and was also shot.<ref name=nrhp/>

With what basically amounted to a [[lynching]] completed the friends and relatives of the Driskells attempted to strike back at the Regulators, whom they saw as murderers. They obtained an [[indictment]] against the Regulators charging them with murder.<ref name=nrhp/> The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, no jury formed so the judge cleared the charges.<ref name=nrhp/> The presiding judge, Thomas Ford, later became governor of Illinois.<ref name=nrhp/>

A replacement for the destroyed building, however, was not too soon in being approved and constructed.<ref name=nrhp2/>

===Courthouse limbo===
[[Image:Ogle County Old Courthouse Oregon Il4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Builders added the striking cupola in 1892, after the courthouse's dedication.]]For two years, between the March 1841 arson and March 1843, court convened in various private residences. It was during these years that Ogle County was without a courthouse in its [[county seat]], Oregon. Without a courthouse in Oregon people began to propose moving the county seat. Ogle County communities, [[Byron, Illinois|Byron]], [[Mount Morris, Illinois|Mount Morris]], [[Grand Detour, Illinois|Grand Detour]] and [[Daysville, Illinois|Daysville]] were all in contention for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding vote for county seat the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawl of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it retained its status as county seat of Ogle County.<ref name=nrhp/>

===Second courthouse===
The replacement for the first courthouse, destroyed by [[arson]], was not completed until the summer of 1848. The county used it for several decades but it was soon outgrown as the various county offices began to accumulate more and more records and files.<ref name=nrhp2/> A one-story [[brick]] building, it was constructed for $3,000. The structure exhibited [[Greek Revival]] style, common at the time. Some of the 1848 building's architectural elements included, a vent cupola, double-hung [[sash]] [[window]]s complete with [[shutter]]s, a [[gable]] front roof and [[cornice]] returns. The new building was a multi-purpose public building. Besides being the courthouse it served as the meeting hall for the [[Evangelical Lutheran]] Congregation of Oregon until 1850. When community leader Henry Mix died in 1867 citizens gathered at the courthouse to mourn.

Though the 1848 Ogle County Courthouse was soon found to be "inadequate in every respect it would be over 40 years before a new facility was built. The idea of a new courthouse was met with staunch opposition and it was not until 1891 that the 1848 building was demolished and the current building erected.

===Third courthouse===
The current old courthouse in Ogle County was completed in 1891 and has been in constant use since that date. It was dedicated on August 20, 1891 and remained the county's primary judicial building until the same date 114 years later, in 2005. On that day [[Ogle County, Illinois|Ogle County]] dedicated its fourth courthouse across the street from the historic old courthouse.<ref name=nrhp2/> The courthouse was completed at a cost slightly more than $100,000. It is built of red pressed brick and detailed with [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]] and [[Ashton, Illinois|Ashton]] stone with a rock faced design. Architect George O. Garnsey, who also designed the Ellwood House in nearby [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]], designed the building in [[Romanesque Revival]] style and C.A. Moses was the primary contractor for construction. The [[cupola]] was not added to the roof until 1892.<ref name=nrhp/>

During its early years the courthouse was a popular meeting ground. The courthouse lawn was a common setting for community events and gatherings.<ref name=or/> Today, events no longer take regularly take place on the courthouse lawn but some festivals still occur at the location. After being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 a series of renovations began on the building, in order to, "preserve its historical and architectural intergrity."<ref name=or/> On the interior each office and courtroom was renovated and the exterior of the structure was also refurbished and restored. The work was completed in 1983 and the building opened for public tours in 1984.<ref name=or/>

==Architecture==
This example of [[Romanesque Revival]] architecture was desgined by [[George O. Garnsey]], a Chicago architect well-known in northern Illinois. An impressive structure, the courthouse is on a [[monumental scale]].

===Exterior===
The red brick facade is detailed with significant amounts of limestone, including in its continuous [[lintel]]s and [[sill]]s. The entrances are covered with large round [[arch]]es. The full basement is hinted at by the building's prominent foundation and [[watertable]].<ref name=nrhp/>
