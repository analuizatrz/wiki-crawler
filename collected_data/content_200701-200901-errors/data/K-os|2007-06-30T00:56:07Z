'''k-os''' (born '''Kevin Brereton''' on [[February 20]], [[1972]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[rapper]], [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[record producer]] of [[Trinidadian]] descent. His real name may also be cited as '''Kheaven''', a spelling he adopted later.

The alias "k-os" is pronounced "chaos" and is an [[acronym]] for "[[Self-knowledge|Knowledge of Self]]," although in a later interview he also said that it stands for "Kheaven's Original Sound." His music incorporates a wide variety of music genres including but not limited to [[rap]], [[funk]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[reggae]]. The lyrics frequently focus on promoting a "positive message" while at times expressing criticism of mainstream hip hop culture's obsession with money, fame and glorification of violence.<ref name="bill">

[[Image:kos-sundaymorning.JPG|thumb|200px|k-os' latest single '''Sunday Morning''''s cover.]]

While attending York University, k-os gained his first exposure in the music industry in 1993 when he released the single "Musical Essence" {{audio|K-os - Musical Essence.ogg|sample}} with a music video financed by a [[VideoFACT]] grant.

In a relatively quiet dispute, some lyrics from the single "B-Boy Stance" were interpreted as an insult on the Toronto-based rapper [[K'naan]]. In the single, k-os rapped "They took cameras to Africa for pictures to rhyme / Over; Oh, yes, the great pretenders," and "Religious entertainers who want to be life savers." K’naan interpreted the lyrics as being aimed at him filming the music video for the single ''Soobax'' in [[Kenya]].<ref name="beef">{{cite web
