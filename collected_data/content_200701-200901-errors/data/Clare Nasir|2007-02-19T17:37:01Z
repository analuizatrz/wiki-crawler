== Educational background and career ==
Clare graduated from the [http://www.kingsbrook.northants.sch.uk/ Kingsbrook School], in Milton Keynes, in 1988. She studied at the [[University of Plymouth]] and graduated with an [[honours degree]] in [[Mathematics]], continuing on with her [[masters degree]] in Applied [[Marine Sciences]]. She then began her training at the [[Met Office]] to become a qualified [[weather forecaster]].

Two years later, Clare joined the London Weather Centre, offering weather forecasting and presenting services to [[London]] [[radio stations]] and media outlets. Subsequently, she took a position as forecaster and presenter for [[Anglia Television]].

She returned to London to work for [[Carlton Television]] in 1998, spending almost two years before taking a position with GMTV.

In 2001 she was made weather producer and presenter, being responsible for all weather output and weather-related features on GMTV.

She also reports from worldwide field locations on meteorological issues and items of correlative interest.  Probably her most famous TV moment, and one which has often been re-shown, saw her reporting from a seafront which was being lashed by wind and rain.  In the middle of her report, an enormous wave burst over the harbour wall, completely covering her and sending her flying out of shot.  Undeterred, she picked herself up and finished her report, having to speak directly into the boom microphone as she had lost her microphone pack.

In addition to presenting the weather on GMTV, Clare hosted several series, including "Interactive Wedding", the travel series "Great Escapes", and "Extreme Weather", wherein she investigated globally changing weather patterns.

==Quotes==
On education:
<blockquote>
''"With 3 A-level passes there was a variety of degree courses and universities to which I could have applied, but I chose Plymouth because it allowed me to combine a mainly mathematics based degree with another subject, Ocean Science. Three years later I graduated with a 2.1 honours degree. In my final year project I combined the mathematical skills I had learnt with my interest in marine science. This put me in a good position to apply for the MSc in Applied Marine Science, again at Plymouth. I then applied to the Meteorological Office and succeeded in fulfilling a long term ambition when I was selected to train as a weather forecaster and presenter. My background in mathematics and the science based postgraduate qualification was ideal for this type of work. I would highly recommend a mathematics degree."''
