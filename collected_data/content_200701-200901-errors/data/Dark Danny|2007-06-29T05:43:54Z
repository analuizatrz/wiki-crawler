'''Dark Danny''' is a villain in ''[[Danny Phantom]]''.  A full-ghost--a [[gestalt]] of the ghost-halves of [[Danny Phantom (Daniel Fenton)|Danny Phantom]] '''AND''' [[Vlad Plasmius]].  Dark Dan Phantom's first and only appearance is in ''[[The Ultimate Enemy]]'' which was both a TV movie and the first ''Danny Phantom'' video game for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. He is voiced by [[Eric Roberts]] (father to [[Emma Roberts]] of [[Unfabulous]] fame).

Wanting to mix in time traveling while Danny battled a pure evil ghost, Butch Hartman realized the worst enemy for [[Danny Phantom (Daniel Fenton)|Danny Phantom]] to fight would be an evil version of himself. [http://hometown.aol.com/zcat6/IntBH2006p5.html] He was not originally revealed to be a villain in the advertisements for ''The Ultimate Enemy'' on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], due to the shock factor of Danny's future as his own worst enemy, though internet sources already confirmed it.

==History==
An accidental explosion of the Nasty Burger heater took the lives of Danny's family, friends, and teacher, causing the grief stricten boy to move in with his arch enemy, [[Vlad Plasmius|Vlad]], seeing as "''he was the only person left on the planet who could possibly hope to understand his situation''". Despite the history of animosity between the two halfas, Vlad treated Danny with a great deal of sympathy. Completely taken over by grief, Danny asked Vlad to separate his human and ghost halves, believing him being half-ghost was the cause of the deaths of his family and friends, since he used his ghost powers to cheat. After the procedure, the separated Danny Phantom suddenly became malevolent, forcibly removing Vlad's ghost-half and merging with it, resulting in Dark Danny's birth. His first act of malice was murdering the human Danny Fenton and blowing up the entire Masters' [[mansion]] before unleashing ten years of pain and destruction on both Earth and the Ghost Zone.

Upon witnessing this horrible future, the Observents ordered [[Clockwork (Danny Phantom)|Clockwork]] to kill Danny in the past to prevent Dark Danny's rise. Dispatching various ghosts from the future to eliminate Danny, it set about a chain reaction that led Danny to the future where he encountered his dark self. Fusing the time medallion so he'd was stuck in the future, Dark Danny sends Danny to the Ghost Zone to keep him occupied while he disguises as his 14-year-old self and travels to the past via a leftover time medallion to secure his future, namely cheating on the C.A.T test, the only witness having figured out he's true identity his sister Jazz. After cheating the C.A.T. via test answers (that Danny obtained previously by accident), a suspicious Lancer calls his parents over to the Nasty Burger as demonstration of Danny's possible future at the same time Sam and Tucker warn them on the oncoming explosion and Jazz, who using the Fenton Ghost Peeler exposed Dark Danny to the rest. 

Tying them all to the boiler, Dark Danny eventually reunited with his past self (having returned via Future Vlad) and a battle ensured, Danny victorious by using the Ghostly Wail as an advantage, a power Dark Danny would not obtain for another ten years. Despite his victory over his evil self, Danny's weakened powers seemingly failed to save everyone if not for Clockwork who saved them at last minute, sending Danny back in time to when the test began and giving him a second chance at changing his future.

Dark Danny was subsequently trapped in Danny's Fenton Thermos, which was given to Clockwork after the battle, who was told that it was to be his responsibility. At the end of the episode, we see the thermos misshap as if Dark Danny is attempting to escape.

===Real Name===
There is debate on what this character's real name is. In ''"The Ultimate Enemy"'', Valerie and Skulktech 9.9 refers to him by his last name, "''Phantom''". The end credits, Butch Hartman, and [[tv.com]] call him Dark Danny, while the game calls him Dan Phantom, which has become an unofficial name for some fans. He never does introduce himself by name, and it's doubtful that he would continue using his former name, so his true name may yet be unknown. The most logical answer is that his name is Dark Danny, considering Butch Hartman, the creator of the series, named him as such. The name "''Dark Danny''" comes from the obvious fact he '''is''' a darker version of Danny.

==Personality/Weakness==
Unlike all of Danny's other enemies, Dark Danny has no guilt or conscience - he is ''pure'' evil, a monster who is willing to kill to get what he wants, even if it's the people he once loved. Though he still makes a few jokes, his personality is sadistic, cruel, and merciless, far worse than any other villain on the show. This personality shift most likely comes as a result of both Danny and Vlad's personalities combining, since he is the fusion result of their two ghost halves. Since it was Danny's ghost half that caused the merge by overshadowing Vlad's ghost half, Danny is the dominant half--identity and memory-wise, which is why he refers to the present time Danny as his "past". 
[[Image:YoungerDarkDanny.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Dark Danny's younger form, ready to start his ten year road of havoc.]]

The only difference is without his human self to hold him back Dark Danny can go to lengths any other character, even Vlad, wouldn't even dare to go to.  While other villains would kill for personal gain, revenge, or because it's their job, Dark Danny kills because he has the power to and can't feel guilt for it. In the end, he only does what he does just for his own pleasure or benefit. 

If Dark Danny has any weaknesses, it's that he seriously underestimated his younger self and the power of the human heart, now that he doesn't have one. In addition, he has the handicap of being unable to kill his past, heroic self for fear of putting his existence in danger. He was defeated when present-time Danny, determined to save his family and friends from his own future incarnation, suffered blow after crushing blow and ultimately managed to suck Dark Danny down with the Fenton Thermos, after using the Ghostly Wail on him twice, which greatly weakened his older self, but drained him (regular Danny) of all his ghost energy. However, since Dark Danny now exists outside the time stream, he is no longer hindered by what becomes of present-time Danny.  

Since he has largely forgotten his human life, he no longer remembers any of the Fenton Inventions.  He is a full ghost now, the inventions are more effective against him, but because of his tremendous powers, they still can't harm him as severely as they normally would on other ghosts. If Dark Danny has any other weaknesses, it could be his fiery hair. When Danny hit his older self into a gas truck, it exploded thanks to his hair. However, he seemed impervious to the fire itself.

==Theories/Inconsistencies==
[[Image:DannyMeetsFutureSelf.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dark Danny encounters his past self.]]

*In the episode [[Identity Crisis (Danny Phantom)|"''Identity Crisis''"]], Danny and his ghost self were separated by a device created to capture ectoplasmic energy, Danny's personality was [[polar]]ized; resulting in the birth of the lazy human Danny Fenton with a [[passive]] personality, and the heroic ghost Danny Phantom with a [[proactive]] personality. However, after being separated for a while, the two willingly rejoined into one being. Thus it is never fully explained why Danny's ghost self was completely evil in this movie. It could be that the accident at the Nasty Burger drastically traumatized Danny, making him more violent, thus creating an internal darkness that allowed Vlad's ghost-half to completely eliminate Danny Phantom's good side, or that Vlad's pure evil ghost-half destroyed all that was good in Danny Phantom. Although, in "''Identity Crisis''", the Ghost Catcher separated nearly everything about Danny into two, including his emotions and when Vlad removed Danny Phantom from Danny Fenton, Phantom became emotionless. It is also possible that the Ghost Gauntlets and Ghost Catcher have two different effects on the people/ghosts on which they are used.

*Technically speaking, if Vlad's and Danny's ghost selves merged, then Vlad's ghost self should be the dominant one since he is more powerful than Danny. However, in this case, Danny's ghost self remains to be more dominant as it is apparent in both Danny Phantom's appearance and personality. In fact he only has some of Danny's memories. The only part of Vlad's ghost self that seems to have taken over Danny's ghost self even partially is his appearance. Perhaps it is a testimony of Danny Phantom's growing powers that caused the merge of overshadowing Vlad. It could be that Danny <i>is</i> actually more powerful than Vlad (possibly due to Vlad's powers coming from a prototype ghost portal as opposed to a completed and functional one that gave Danny his) but is still weaker due to inexperience. This is supported by the fact that Danny has matched and even surpassed Vlad on a few occasions despite having only around 1/20 as much experience as Vlad.

* Dark Danny is the first ghost of significantly great power against which a Fenton Thermos was used. The circumstances under which he was imprisoned suggests the Fenton Thermos has limits to its effectiveness against ghostly entities of magnificent might. Specifically, Dark Danny was only sealed after he had been significantly weakened in power from prolonged battled against [[Danny Fenton]], aided by some of the Fentons gadgets. Dark Danny himself actually remarks, while he is being pulled inside the Thermos, that he is too weak to escape, and in later scenes the metal casing of Thermos is seen being dramatically misshaped from within by the considerable power of the imprisoned evil ghost.

==Ghost Powers==
Since he became Dark Danny by merging with Vlad's ghost self, he has all of Vlad's and Danny's combined powers at his disposal. This makes him stronger than both Danny and Vlad, and apparently stronger than any other villain. He has both gained completely new abilities that neither Danny or Vlad can do as well as increased the power of his past ones.  Below is a complete list of his currently known abilities:

===Seen Powers===
#'''Ghost Sense''' &ndash; Dark Danny can sense nearby ghosts.  When he does, a wisp of red [[ectoplasm]] comes out of his nose.  It even works when his younger self is coming.  This is most likely due to the fact that he is a fusion of Vlad's ghost half, and therefore has different DNA.  It is unknown if he has the cold generation abilities that Danny learned in ''Urban Jungle''.
#'''[[Wiktionary:intangibility|Intangibility]] & [[Invisibility]]''' - He has the ability to disappear and to be able to pass through solid objects.
#'''[[Flying]]'''/'''[[Floating]]'''/'''Hovering''' - Standard ghost powers.
#'''Paranormal Strength, Speed, Agility and Durability''' - Dark Danny is obviously far more durable than Danny or Vlad.  He can even survive the blast of a Tracker ([[Valerie Gray]]) as seen in the show. He was able to lift a tank and throw it with ease.
#'''Overshadowing/[[Possession]]''' - Standard ghost powers. 
#'''Ectoplasmic Energy Blast - "Ghost Ray"''' - His blast is composed of green ectoplasm; it is stronger than Danny's blasts seeing that he was able to blow up cars, large parts of buildings, and even murder Danny.
#'''Ectoplasmic Energy Shield - "Ghost Shield"''' - He isn't seen using any shields, but seeing as Danny and Vlad both have the power, it is likely that he has one or more of them. And seeing that his blasts are the same color as Danny's it is likely that it is green.
#'''Wall Walking''' &ndash; Dark Danny, as well as many other ghosts, can walk on uneven and vertical surfaces as though they were horizontal.  Most likely this is an application of his flying/hovering ability.
#'''Ghost Stinger''' &ndash; Dark Danny uses this pseudo-electric attack to cause Danny to turn back into a human and to knock Jazz out.
#'''Ghostly Wail''' - In The Ultimate Enemy, Dark Danny develops the unique ability to generate an extremely powerful shriek from his vocal cords and mouth, a bit like a [[Banshee]]'s wail and it sounds like moaning ghosts. .  It can cause terrible pain to ghosts and damage tangible matter. This technique is Dark Danny's most powerful attack, and he's able to use it more than once without losing any energy, unlike Danny who could only use it once or twice but afterwards would quickly be drained of his energy and revert back to his human form.  When he learned this ability he used it on [[Ember McLain|Ember]], destroying her vocal cords and causing her to become overweight in an alarmingly short time. After Danny was thrown in the Ghost Zone, he also gained this abillty.  When he uses this attack on Dark Danny, he is totally shocked because Dark Danny doesn't learn that ability until ten years later.  This shows that Dark Danny has indeed changed the past, and by doing so, he winds up giving Danny a new ability over [[Vlad Plasmius|Vlad Masters]].
#'''Duplication''' - Dark Danny can create about five doubles, possibly a few more.  These doubles can be invisible when made, and can be made in his disguise.  Though it's possible the fifth double was a mistake on the show.
#'''Ectoplasmic Energy Constructs''' - Dark Danny is capable of forming binds and ropes out of ectoplasm.

===New Powers===
These are some attacks that Danny, as well as his "cousin" Danielle and arch-enemy Vlad can't do at this time.
#'''Shapeshifting/Spectral Minipulation/Phase-Shifting''' –  Dark Danny took on the form like the real Danny Fenton in order to disguise his appearance.  It can be assumed that this ability covers all humanoid creatures, as well, though it is possible he could transform into Danny due to his connection with him. His ability to convert his body into a green, gaseous form (as seen when Future Valerie threw an Ecto-Grenade at him,) is also a part of his Spectral Minipulation/Phase-Shifting ability.
#'''Ghost Portal Creation'''- He can create temporary portals into the ghost zone by merely waving his hand.  It is possible Dark Danny gained this power when he destroyed the Fenton Portal.
#'''Immobilization''' - He can freeze a person by touching or waving his hand at them. 
#'''Ectoplasmic Goo''' - He can shoot ecto goo like [[Spider-Man]]'s webs. 
#'''Advanced Spectral Manipulation''' – Dark Danny has gained the ability to change the shape of his body.  Among these occasions include stretching along the waistline, creating holes in his stomach, temporarily vaporizing his middle, and turning his head 180 degrees.
#'''Intangibility Fusion''' – Dark Danny was able to fuse one of Clockwork's time medallions into Danny through the use of his intangibility powers.  While fused, the object inserted is unreachable by human or ghost abilities; it can, however, be removed through the use of special equipment (I.E., the Ghost Gauntlets).
#'''Sleep Beam''' - Dark Danny was able to shoot Jazz with a "sleep beam", but it didn't hurt her like an ordinary beam; it just knocked her out. (it could just be more control over the strength of his ghost ray; something like the "stun" setting seen on many fictional sci-fi weapons)
