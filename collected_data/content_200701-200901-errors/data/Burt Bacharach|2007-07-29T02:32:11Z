'''Burt Bacharach''' ({{IPA2|/bɝt-ˈbæ.kə.ˌɹæk/}}, born [[May 12]], [[1928]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]) is an award-winning [[United States|American]] [[pianist]] and [[composer]]. He is best known for his many pop hits from 1962-70, with lyrics written by [[Hal David]], many of which were recorded by [[Dionne Warwick]]. As of 2006, Bacharach had written a total of 70 Top 40 hits in the U.S., and 52 [[Top 40]] hits in the UK. [http://www.bacharachonline.com/bacharach_bio.html]

==Professional biography==
Bacharach studied [[music]] at [[McGill University]], the [[Mannes College of Music|Mannes School of Music]], and the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California. His composition teachers included [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]], and [[Henry Cowell]]. In the 1950s and early 1960s he was the pianist, arranger and bandleader for [[Marlene Dietrich]], with whom he toured. 

Bacharach's music is characterized by unusual chord progessions, striking syncopated rhythmic patterns, irregular phrasing, frequent modulation, and odd and changing meters. It tends toward a greater climactic effect than most popular music, especially greater than most popular music of the period in which he is most associated. Bacharach is more than a mere songwriter, having himself arranged, conducted, and co-produced much of his recorded output. An example of his use of distinctive use of changing meter is found in "[[Promises, Promises]]" (from his score for the musical of the same name). In this song, he incorporates a very complex time signature sequence of |3/8|÷|4/8|3/8|÷|4/8|. 

===Early work===
In 1957, Bacharach and [[lyricist]] [[Hal David]] were introduced at the famous [[Brill Building]] in [[New York City]], and began their songwriting partnership. Almost a year later, they received a major career break when their song "The Story of My Life" was recorded by [[Marty Robbins]] for [[Columbia Records]], becoming a #1 hit on the U.S. Country charts in late 1957. Soon afterwards, "Magic Moments" was recorded by [[Perry Como]] for [[RCA Records]], and became a #4 U.S. hit in February of that year. Other hits quickly followed. "Heavenly" was recorded by [[Johnny Mathis]] and became a gold record in the UK. Later the same year another Bacharach song, "Faithfully", also achieved gold record status with Mathis in the UK. 

In the early 1960s, Bacharach wrote well over a hundred songs with David,  including a wealth of popular hits throughout the 1960s and 1970s, many of which still enjoy popularity today. Bacharach and David were associated throughout the sixties with [[Dionne Warwick]], a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]]-trained vocalist whom he met in 1961. She began working for the duo when they needed a good singer to "demo" their songs properly for other artists. Bacharach and David noticed that Warwick's demos often exceeded the quality of the performances others were recording{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. They started writing a portion of their work specifically with Warwick in mind, which led to one of the most successful teams in [[popular music]] history.<ref>"The Burt Bacharach Collection" - CD issued by WEA Europe (liner notes)</ref> Over a twenty year period, beginning in the early 1960s, Warwick managed to chart 38 singles co-written or produced by Bacharach, including twenty-two Top-40 hits on the American [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bacharach's songs were made famous by a number of popular singers in addition to Warwick, including [[The Shirelles]], [[The Beatles]] ("Baby, It's You"), [[The Carpenters]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[B.J. Thomas]] ("Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head"), [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] ("What's New, Pussycat"), [[The Stranglers]], [[Dusty Springfield]] ("The Look of Love"), [[The Drifters]], [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]] ("Wives and Lovers"), [[Jackie DeShannon]] ("What the World Needs Now is Love"),[[Gene Pitney]], [[Herb Alpert]], [[Jerry Butler]] and [[Luther Vandross]].

In addition to mainstream pop, many Bacharach songs were adapted by [[jazz]] artists of the time, such as [[Stan Getz]] and [[Wes Montgomery]]. The Bacharach/David composition, "My Little Red Book", originally recorded by [[Manfred Mann]] for the film ''What's New, Pussycat'', and promptly [[cover song|covered]] by [[Love (band)|Love]] in 1966, has become a rock music standard; however, according to [[Robin Platts]]' book "Burt Bacharach and Hal David", the composer did not like this version.  Bacharach composed and arranged the soundtrack of the 1967 film ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Bacharach and David also collaborated with [[Broadway Theatre|Broadway]] producer [[David Merrick]] on the 1968 musical production of ''Promises, Promises'', which yielded several major hit songs (including the title tune). 1969 saw, perhaps, the most successful Bacharach-David collaboration ever, with the song "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head", which was prominently featured in the acclaimed film ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid''. "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" won the [[Oscar award]] for Best Song and also was Bacharach's biggest worldwide hit.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===1970s and 1980s===
By the early 1970s, changing public tastes created a more competitive atmosphere for pop music. In 1973, Bacharach and David  were commissioned to score the [[Ross Hunter]]-produced revival of the classic 1937 film, ''[[Lost Horizon (film)|Lost Horizon]]'', [[Lost Horizon (1973 film)]] for [[Columbia Pictures]]. The result was a critical and commercial disaster, and resulted in a flurry of [[lawsuits]] between the songwriter and lyricist, as well as from Warwick, who reportedly felt abandoned when Bacharach and David refused to work together. Bacharach tried several solo projects (including the 1977 album ''Futures''), but the projects failed to yield any memorable hits.

By the early 1980s, Bacharach's marriage with [[Angie Dickinson]] had failed, but a new partnership with lyricist [[Carole Bayer Sager]] proved more rewarding, both commercially and personally. The two married, and collaborated on several major hits during the decade, including "Arthur’s Theme (Best That You Can Do)" ([[Christopher Cross]]), "Heartlight" ([[Neil Diamond]]), "Making Love", "On My Own", and perhaps most memorably, "That's What Friends Are For" in 1985, actually the second single which reunited Bacharach and singer Warwick. The profits for the latter song were given to [[AIDS]] research. Bacharach's 1980s tunes showed a new sound, proving that Bacharach's work could continue to change with the times.

Other artists continued to revive Bacharach's earlier hits, giving them an entirely new audience in the 1980s and 1990s. Examples included Naked Eyes' 1983 dance version of "(There’s) Always Something There to Remind Me", [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s smash 1982 country version of "Any Day Now", and many others. Bacharach also continued a successful concert career, appearing at auditoriums throughout the world, often featuring large orchestras as accompaniment. He also occasionally joined with Warwick, appearing in sold-out concerts in New York, [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], and [[Los Angeles]].

===Later work===  
In 1998, Bacharach co-wrote and recorded a [[Grammy]]-winning album with [[Elvis Costello]], ''Painted From Memory''.  In 2006, he recorded a jazz album with [[Trijntje Oosterhuis]] and the Metropole Orchestra called ''[[The Look of Love (Trijntje Oosterhuis album)|The Look Of Love (Burt Bacharach Songbook)]]'' which was released in November that year.<ref>[http://www.platomania.nl/verwacht.asp PlatoMania.nl] Scheduled Dutch album releases. <small>Retrieved: October 25, 2006</small></ref>
Bacharach collaborated with [[Cathy Dennis]] in 2002 to write an original song for the [[Pop Idol]] winner [[Will Young]].  This was [[What's In Goodbye]] and it appears on Young's debut album [[From Now On]].  During July of 2002, Young was a guest vocalist at two of Bacharach's concerts, one at the Hammersmith Apollo and the other at Liverpool Pops.

Bacharach's 2005 album ''At This Time'' saw a departure from past works in that Bacharach penned his own lyrics, some of which dealt with political themes.  Guest stars on some tracks included [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Rufus Wainwright]].

He has also worked with hip hop producer [[Dr. Dre]] on his recent album At This Time and is expected to do work on Dr. Dre's long awaited [[Detox]] album.

===Film and television===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bacharach was featured in a dozen TV musical/variety specials videotaped in the UK for [[ITC]], several of which were nominated for [[Emmy]] awards for direction (by [[Dwight Hemion]]). The guests included artists such as [[Joel Grey]], [[Dusty Springfield]], and [[Barbra Streisand]]. Bacharach and David also did the score for a short-lived [[ABC-TV]] series, ''[[ABC Stage '67]]'', for a show titled ''On the Flip Side'', starring [[Rick Nelson]] as a faded pop star trying for a comeback. While the series' ratings were dismal, the soundtrack showcased Bacharach's abilities to try different kinds of musical styles, ranging from (almost) 1960s rock, to pop, ballads, and Latin-tinged dance numbers.  

In 1969, his instrumental composition "Nikki" (named for his daughter) premiered as the theme for the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'', a TV series which eventually ran on various nights of the week until 1975. Also during the 1970s, Bacharach and then-wife Angie Dickinson appeared in several TV commercials for [[Martini & Rossi]] beverages, and even penned a short jingle ("Say Yes") for the spots. Bacharach also occasionally appeared on TV/variety shows, such as ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and many others.  

In the 1990s and 2000s, Bacharach has had [[cameo role]]s in a number of [[Hollywood]] movies including all three [[Austin Powers]] spy spoof movies. His music is also credited as providing inspiration for these movies, partially stemming from Bacharach's score for the 1967 [[James Bond]]  film ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.

During subsequent Burt Bacharach concert tours, each show would open with a very brief video clip from the movie ''[[Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery]]'', with [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] (as Austin Powers) uttering "Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Burt Bacharach."
In late 2006, Burt Bacharach appeared as the celebrity in a Geico auto insurance commercial, where he sings and plays the piano.  He translates the customer's story through song ("I was hit. ..in the rear!")

==Family==
Bacharach has been married four times, first to Paula Stewart (1953–1958), second to actress [[Angie Dickinson]] (1965–1980), third to lyricist [[Carole Bayer Sager]] (1982–1991) — with whom he collaborated on a number of pieces — and fourth (since 1993) to Jane Hanson. He has four children, two girls and two boys. Nikki Bacharach, Bacharach and Dickinson's daughter — for whom he wrote the instrumental piece "Nikki" — died of [[suffocation]] using a plastic bag and helium on [[January 4]], [[2007]] at age 40.<ref>[[The Washington Post]]  ([[January 5]], [[2007]])  ''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501705.html Burt Bacharach's daughter commits suicide]''</ref> Nikki spent 9 years at the Wilson Center, a psychiatric residential treatment facility for adolescents located in Faribault, Minnesota. Nikki had [[Asperger Syndrome]], a high functioning form of [[autism]].<ref>[[Independent News & Media]] ([[8 January]] [[2007]])'' [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2134839.ece Asperger's syndrome: The ballad of Nikki Bacharach] </ref>
