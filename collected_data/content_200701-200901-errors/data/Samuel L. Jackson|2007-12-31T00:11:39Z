==Acting career==
===1970s - 1980s===
Jackson initially decided to go to Morehouse College to major in Architecture, but decided to change his major to Drama<ref name="tributeca.com">{{cite web | title=tributeca.com | work=Star Bios: Samuel L.

After these initial roles, Jackson proceeded to move from Atlanta to New York City in 1976 and spent the next decade appearing in stage plays such as ''[[The Piano Lesson]]'' and ''[[Two Trains Running]]'' which both premiered at the Yale Repertory Theater .<ref name="Hollywoodfirm">{{cite web | title=Hollywoodfirm.com | work=Biographies: Samuel L. Jackson | url=http://www.hollywoodfirm.com/Biographies/jackson.htm | accessdate=December 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> At this point in his early career, Jackson developed an alcohol and cocaine addiction, resulting in him being unable to proceed with the two plays as they continued to Broadway (actors [[Charles S. Dutton]] and [[Anthony Chisolm]] took his place).<ref name="Yahoo Movies.com"/> Throughout his early film career, mainly in minimal roles in films such as ''[[Coming to America]]'' (as a criminal knocking over a fast food joint) and various TV films, Jackson was mentored by [[Morgan Freeman]].<ref name="tiscali.film & tv"/> After a 1981 performance in the play ''A Soldier's Play'', Jackson was introduced to beginning director [[Spike Lee]]<ref name="Yahoo Movies.com"/> who would later include him in small roles for the films ''[[School Daze]]'' (1988) and ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' (1989).<ref name="actors"/> He also played a minor role in the 1990 [[Martin Scorsese]] film ''[[Goodfellas]]'' as real-life [[Mafia]] associate [[Parnell Edwards|Stacks Edwards]].

===1990s===
[[Image:Samburgar.JPG|thumb|220px|left|Jackson as Jules Winnfield in ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', 1994]]
After completing these films, Jackson's cocaine addiction continued to increase to the point where  he overdosed, and his family entered him into a New York rehab clinic.<ref name="tiscali.film & tv"/> When he successfully completed rehab, Jackson acted in ''[[Jungle Fever]]'', as the cocaine addict brother to the relatively new actor [[Wesley Snipes]], a role which Jackson called cathartic as he was recovering from his addiction.<ref name="actors"/> The film was so acclaimed that the 1991 [[Cannes Film Festival]] awarded a special "Supporting Actor" award just for him.<ref name="Hollywood.com">{{cite web | title=Hollywood.com | work=Samuel L. Jackson | url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebs/fulldetail/id/190189 | accessdate=November 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="nytimes"/> After this role, Jackson became involved with multiple film requests, including ''[[Strictly Business]]'', ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'', ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'', and then moving on to two comedies: ''[[Loaded Weapon 1|National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1]]'' and ''[[Amos & Andrew]]''. After rapid involvement in these films, Jackson worked with director [[Steven Spielberg]] in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. He played a major role in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. The film was perhaps Jackson's most notable role, mainly for his monologues and one-liners along with co-star [[John Travolta]].<ref name="actors"/> The film earned Jackson an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] and a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best Supporting Actor award win.<ref name="FilmBug">{{cite web | title=FilmBug.com | work=Samuel L.

With a succession of unsuccessful films such as ''[[Kiss of Death (1995 film)|Kiss of Death]]'', ''[[The Great White Hype]]'', and ''[[Losing Isaiah]]'', Jackson began to receive poor reviews from critics who were just praising him before with ''Pulp Fiction''. This ended with his involvement in the two successful box office films ''[[A Time to Kill (film)|A Time To Kill]]'', where he depicted a father who is put on trial for killing two men who raped his daughter, and ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', co-starring along side [[Bruce Willis]] in the third installment of the ''[[Die Hard]]'' series. For ''A Time to Kill'', Jackson earned a NAACP Image for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture.<ref name="SuperiorPics.com">{{cite web | title=SuperiorPics.com | work=Samuel L. Jackson | url=http://www.superiorpics.com/samuel_l__jackson/ | accessdate=December 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Quickly becoming a box office star, Jackson continued with three starring roles in 1997. In ''[[One Eight Seven|187]]'' he played a teacher, dedicated to educating students in a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] high school but with a terrible secret. He received an Independent Spirit award for Best First Feature<ref name="SuperiorPics.com"/> alongside first-time writer/director [[Kasi Lemmons]] in the drama film ''[[Eve's Bayou]]'', for which he also served as executive producer.

In 1999, Jackson starred in a shark horror film, ''[[Deep Blue Sea]]'', and as [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]] in [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''. In an interview, Jackson claimed that he did not have a chance to read the script for the film and did not learn he was playing the character Mace Windu until he was fitted for his costume (it is said that he was eager to accept any role, just for the chance to be a part of the Star Wars saga).<ref name="BigFanBoy.com">{{cite web | title=BigFanBoy.com | work=SAMUEL L.
