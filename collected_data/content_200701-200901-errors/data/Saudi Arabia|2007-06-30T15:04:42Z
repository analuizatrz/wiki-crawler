The '''Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''' ({{lang-ar|<big>المملكة العربية السعودية</big>}}, ''al-Mamlaka al-{{Unicode|ʻArabiyya as-Saʻ}}ūdiyya'') is the largest country on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It is bordered by [[Jordan]] on the northwest, [[Iraq]] on the north and northeast, [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] on the east, [[Oman]] on the southeast, and [[Yemen]] on the south, with the [[Persian Gulf]] to its northeast and the [[Red Sea]] to its west. 

The Kingdom is sometimes called "The Lands of The Two Holy Mosques" in reference to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the two holiest places in [[Islam]]. In English, it is most commonly referred to as '''Saudi Arabia''' (pronounced /{{IPA|ˈsɒdɪ}}/ or  /{{IPA|ˈsaudɪ  əˈɹeɪ̯bɪə}}/), often as just '''Saudi''' or '''the Kingdom''' by many English-speaking [[expatriate]]s in the kingdom, or, less commonly (as in international football events or in the national press) as '''KSA''' or '''SA'''. Sometimes '''Arabia''' is used to refer to the nation, but the term can also refer to the entire Arabian Peninsula. The [[Arabic]] short form is usually '''as-Sa{{Unicode|ʻ}}ūdiyya''' (السعودية), but local citizens often just refer to the nation as '''al-Mamlaka''' (''the Kingdom''). 

Saudi Arabia is the world's leading [[Petroleum#Top petroleum-producing countries|petroleum exporter]] and [[petroleum]] exports fuel the [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi economy]].<ref>http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/topworldtables1_2.html US Department of Energy - Top World Oil Net Exporters, 2005</ref> Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of exports and nearly 75 percent of government revenues, facilitating the creation of a [[welfare state]],<ref>http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm</ref><ref>http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&InNewsItemID=1746</ref> which the government has found difficult to fund during periods of low oil prices.<ref>http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=164957&Sn=BUSI&IssueID=29274</ref> 

==History==
[[Image:Azizfdr.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The founder of modern Saudi Arabia, [[King Abdul Aziz]], converses with President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] on board a ship returning from the [[Yalta Conference]] in 1945.]]
{{main|History of Saudi Arabia}}
Although the region in which the country stands today has an [[Ancient Arabia|ancient history]], the emergence of the Saudi dynasty began in central Arabia in 1744.  That year, [[Muhammad bin Saud]], the ruler of the town of [[Diriyah|Ad-Dir'iyyah]] near [[Riyadh]], joined forces with a cleric, [[Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab]], to create a new political entity.  This alliance formed in the 18th Century remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today. Over the next 150 years, the fortunes of the Saud family rose and fell several times as Saudi rulers contended with [[Egypt]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and other Arabian families for control on the peninsula. The Saudi state was founded by the late King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]] (known internationally as ''Abdul Aziz bin Saud'').

In [[1902]] at the age of only 22, Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud re-captured [[Riyadh]], the Al-Saud dynasty's ancestral capital, from the rival [[Rashidi|Al-Rashid]] family. Continuing his conquests, Abdul Aziz subdued [[Al-Hasa]], [[Al-Qatif]], the rest of [[Nejd]], and [[Hejaz]] between [[1913]] and [[1926]]. On [[8 January]] 1926 Abdul Aziz bin Saud became the King of Hejaz. On [[29 January]] [[1927]] he took the title King of Nejd (his previous Nejdi title was Sultan). By the [[Treaty of Jedda]], signed on [[20 May]] 1927, the [[United Kingdom]] recognized the independence of Abdul Aziz's realm, then known as the '''Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz'''. In [[1932]], the principle regions of Al-Hasa, Qatif, Nejd and Hejaz were unified to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Abdul Aziz's military and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of [[Petroleum|oil]] were discovered in March [[1938]]. Development programmes, which were delayed due to the onset of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, began in earnest in 1946 and by 1949 production was in full swing. Oil has provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of leverage in the international community.

Internationally Abdul Aziz initially chose to follow an isolationist policy. He refused to allow Saudi Arabia to join the League of Nations, and he chose to leave his kingdom on only three occasions from 1916 until his death in 1953. One of which was the meeting with President Roosevelt pictured above. Eventually however Abdul Aziz acceded to the realities of world politics and in 1945 Saudi Arabia became a founding member of the [[Arab League]] and joined the [[United Nations]].

Prior to his death in 1953 Abdul Aziz, aware of the difficulties facing other regional absolute rulers reliant on extended family networks, attempted to regulate the succession. He took steps to provide that his eldest living son, Saud, would become king but that he would be required to work closely with his more financially and diplomatically astute brother, Faisal.

Saud succeeded to the throne on his father's death in 1953. However by the early 1960s the Kingdom was in jeopardy due to Saud's economic mismanagement and failure to deal effectively with a regional challenge from [[President of Egypt|Egyptian president]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. As a consequence Saud was deposed in favour of Faisal in 1964.

Intra-family rivalry was one of the factors that led to the assassination of Faisal by his nephew, [[Faisal bin Musa'id|Prince Faisal bin Musa'id]], in 1975. He was succeeded by [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|King Khalid]] until 1982 and then by [[King Fahd]]. When Fahd died in 2005, his half-brother [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] ascended to the throne.

Saudi military was founded as the [[Ikhwan]] army, the tribal army of [[Ibn Saud]]. The Ikhwan had helped king Ibn Saud conquer the Arabian peninsula during the First World War. 

By expanding the military forces years later, Saudi Arabian today has many military branches.

==Politics==
<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Politics of Saudi Arabia}}
The central institution of the Saudi Arabian government is the [[Saudi monarchy]]. The ''Basic Law of Government'' adopted in 1992 declared that Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the sons and grandsons of the first king, [[Abd Al Aziz Al Saud]], it also claims that the [[Qur'an]] is the [[constitution]] of the country, which is governed on the basis of Islamic law ([[Sharia]]) [http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/sa00000_.html].

[[Image:Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] of Saudi Arabia.]]
There are no recognized political parties or national elections, except the local elections which were held in the year 2005. The king's powers are theoretically limited within the bounds of Shari'a and other Saudi traditions. He also must retain a consensus of the Saudi royal family, religious leaders (''[[ulema]]''), and other important elements in Saudi society. The Saudi government spreads [[Islam]] by funding construction of mosques and [[Madrassa|Qur'an schools]] around the world. The leading members of the royal family choose the king from among themselves with the subsequent approval of the ulema.

Saudi kings have gradually developed a central government. Since 1953, the Council of Ministers, appointed by the king, has advised on the formulation of general policy and directed the activities of the growing bureaucracy. This council consists of a prime minister, the first prime minister and twenty ministers.

Legislation is by resolution of the Council of Ministers, ratified by [[Decree|royal decree]], and must be compatible with the Shari'a. A 150-member [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia|Consultative Assembly]], appointed by the King, has limited legislative rights. [[Justice]] is administered according to the Shari'a by a system of religious courts whose judges are appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council, composed of twelve senior jurists. [[Independence]] of the judiciary is protected by law. The king acts as the highest court of appeal and has the power to pardon.  Access to high officials (usually at a ''majlis''; a public audience) and the [[right to petition]] them directly are well-established traditions.

The combination of relatively high oil prices and exports led to a revenues windfall for Saudi Arabia during 2004 and early 2005. For 2004 as a whole, Saudi Arabia earned about $116 billion in net oil export revenues, up 35 percent from 2003 revenue levels. Saudi net oil export revenues are forecast to increase in 2005 and 2006, to $150 billion and $154 billion, respectively, mainly due to higher oil prices. Increased oil prices and consequent revenues since the price collapse of 1998 have significantly improved Saudi Arabia's economic situation, with real GDP growth of 5.2 percent in 2004, and forecasts of 5.7% and 4.8% growth for 2005 and 2006, respectively. 

For [[fiscal year]] 2004, Saudi Arabia originally had been expecting a [[Deficit|budget deficit]]. However, this was based on an extremely conservative price assumption of $19 per barrel for Saudi oil and an assumed production of 7.7 million bbl/d<!--barrels per day?-->. Both of these estimates turned out to be far below actual levels. As a result, as of mid-December 2004, the Saudi Finance Ministry was expecting a huge budget surplus of $26.1 billion, on budget revenues of $104.8 billion (nearly double the country's original estimate) and expenditures of $78.6 billion (28 percent above the approved budget levels). This surplus is being used for several purposes, including: paying down the Kingdom's public debt (to $164 billion from $176 billion at the start of 2004); extra spending on education and development projects; increased security expenditures (possibly an additional $2.5 billion dollars in 2004; see below) due to threats from terrorists; and higher payments to Saudi citizens through subsidies (for housing, education, health care, etc.). For 2005, Saudi Arabia is assuming a balanced budget, with revenues and expenditures of $74.6 billion each. 

In spite of the recent surge in its oil income, Saudi Arabia continues to face serious long-term economic challenges, including high rates of unemployment (12 percent of Saudi nationals <ref>http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=95003&d=15&m=4&y=2007</ref>), one of the world's fastest population growth rates, and the consequent need for increased government spending. All of these place pressures on Saudi oil revenues. The Kingdom also is facing serious security threats, including a number of terrorist attacks (on foreign workers, primarily) in 2003 and 2004. In response, the Saudis reportedly have ramped up spending in the security area (reportedly by 50 percent in 2004, from $5.5 billion in 2003). Saudi Arabia's per capita oil export revenues remain far below high levels reached during the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2004, Saudi Arabia earned around $4,564 per person, versus $22,589 in 1980. This 80 percent decline in real per capita oil export revenues since 1980 is in large part due to the fact that Saudi Arabia's young population has nearly tripled since 1980, while oil export revenues in real terms have fallen by over 40 percent (despite recent increases).  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has faced nearly two decades of heavy budget and trade deficits, the expensive 1990-1991 war with Iraq, and total public debt of around $175 billion. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia does have extensive foreign assets (around $110 billion) which provide a substantial fiscal "cushion." 

[[Saudi Arabia municipal elections, 2005|Saudi municipal elections]] took place in 2005 and some commentators saw this a first tentative step towards the introduction of [[democratic]] processes in the Kingdom, including the legalization of political parties. Other analysts of the Saudi political scene were more skeptical.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4252079.stm</ref>

====Legal system====
Judges are free to impose [[capital punishment]] or  [[corporal punishment]], including [[amputation]]s of hands and feet for certain crimes such as [[murder]], [[robbery]], rape, drug smuggling and for various forms of sexual behavior such as [[homosexuality]] and [[adultery]].  The courts may impose less severe punishments, such as [[flogging]]s, for less serious crimes against [[public morality]] such as [[drunkenness]] <ref>{{PDFlink|http://hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/saudi/saudi.pdf}}</ref>.

The punishments, especially the executions, are carried out in public in order to add [[humiliation]] to the convicted person and also to act as a deterrence.  Judges are generally given a tremendous amount of discretion in deciding how to punish a particular individual, and will make such decisions based on the particular school of Islam that they follow.  For example;  

[[Theft]] is punishable by the amputation of the right hand, unless the thief is poor and the stolen money is from public sources or a company (i.e. the thief is a well-off adult who stole private, secure money). If the right hand has already been amputated, the left hand is chosen instead. 

Drinking, selling, or buying [[alcohol]] and sniffing drugs or injecting [[drugs]] is punished by a sentence of eighty lashes. Smuggling [[heroin]] or [[cocaine]] into the country is punished by death ([[beheading]] with a sword). 

[[Fornication]] is normally punished with 40 lashes. During flogging, the face, head and vital organs of the person are protected. 

[[Adultery]] can only be proven by the testimony of four reliable witnesses. It is punishable by death by [[stoning]], if committed by married men or women. Singles who commit adultery are flogged.

Murder, accidental death and bodily harm are open to punishment from the victim's family. Retribution may be sought in kind or through [[Blood money (term)#In Islam|blood money]]. The blood money payable for a woman's accidental death is half as much as that for a man.<ref>http://www.jeansasson.com/law_and_government.htm</ref> The main reason for this is that, according to Islamic law, men are expected to be providers for their families and therefore are expected to earn more money in their lifetimes. The blood money from a man would be expected to sustain his family, for at least a short time.

===Human rights===
{{main|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}
Several international [[human rights]] organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]] and the [[United Nations]] Human Rights Committee have issued reports critical of the Saudi legal system and its human rights record in various political, legal, and social areas.  The Saudi government typically dismisses such reports as being outright lies or asserts that its actions are based on its adherence to Islamic law.

In 2002, the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Committee against Torture]] criticized Saudi Arabia over the amputations and floggings it carries out under the Shari'a. The Saudi delegation responded defending its legal traditions held since the inception of Islam in the region 1400 years ago and rejected "interference" in its legal system.

===Opposition movements===
{{sect-stub}}
There have been no military opposition movements with the exception of [[Al-Qaeda]], however there have been two serious attempts to overthrow the [[Saudi royal family]]: The first was on 1979-11-20, when heavily armed and provisioned [[Sunni Islam]]ic fundamentalists, consisting of Saudis and Egyptians enrolled in Islamic studies at the Islamic University of Medina, took over and [[Grand Mosque Seizure|besieged Al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca]]. The other was in the year 1980 by [[Shia]] Muslims in the Eastern part of the country. The movement was allegedly supported by the Iranian government. 

The current main opponents of the government are now the [[Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia]] and [[al-Qaeda]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Saudi Arabia map.png|thumb|right|Map of Saudi Arabia]]
{{main|Geography of Saudi Arabia}}
The kingdom occupies about 80 percent of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. A significant length of the country's southern borders with the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], and [[Yemen]] are not precisely defined or marked, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government's estimate is 2,217,949&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]] (856,356&nbsp;[[square miles|miles²]]). Other reputable estimates vary between 1,960,582&nbsp;km²[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html] (756,934&nbsp;mi²) and 2,240,000&nbsp;km² (864,869&nbsp;mi²). The kingdom is commonly listed as the world's 14th largest nation.

Saudi Arabia's geography is varied. From the western coastal region ([[Tihamah]]), the land rises from sea level to a peninsula-long mountain range (Jabal al-[[Hejaz]]) beyond which lies the plateau of [[Nejd]] in the center.  The southwestern [['Asir]] region has mountains as high as 3,000 m (9,840&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]) and is known for having the greenest and freshest climate in all of the country, one that attracts many Saudis to resorts such as [[Abha]] in the summer months.  The east is primarily rocky or sandy lowland continuing to the shores of the [[Persian Gulf]].  The geographically hostile [[Rub' al Khali]] ("[[Empty Quarter]]") desert along the country's imprecisely defined southern borders contains almost no life.

Mostly uninhabited, much of the nation's landmass consists of [[desert]] and [[semi-arid]] regions, with a dwindling traditional [[Bedouin]] population. In these parts of the country, vegetation is limited to weeds, [[Xerophyte|xerophytic]] herbs and shrubs. Less than 2 percent of the kingdom's total area is [[arable land]]. Population centers are mainly located along the eastern and western coasts and densely populated interior oases such as [[Hofuf]] and [[Buraidah]].  In some extended areas, primarily the Rub' al-Khali and the [[Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands]], there is no population whatsoever, although the petroleum industry is constructing a few planned communities there. Saudi Arabia has no permanent year-round rivers or lakes; however, its coastline extends for 2640 km (1640&nbsp;miles) and, on the [[Red Sea]] side, offers world-class coral reefs, including those in the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. 

Native animals include the [[ibex]], [[Wild cat|wildcats]], [[baboon]]s, [[Wolf|wolves]], and [[hyena]]s in the mountainous highlands. Small birds are found in the [[oasis|oases]]. The coastal area on the Red Sea with its [[coral reef]]s has a rich [[marine life]].

===Climate===
Extreme heat and aridity are characteristic of most of Saudi Arabia. It is one of the few places in the world where summer temperatures above 50°[[Celsius|C]] (120°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) are common,{{Fact|date=June 2007}} while in winter frost or snow can occur in the interior and the higher mountains, although this does not occur annually. The average winter temperature range is 8° to 20°C (47° to 68°F) in January in interior cities such as Riyadh and 19° to 29°C (66° to 83°F) in [[Jeddah]] on the Red Sea coast. The average summer range in July is 27° to 43°C (81° to 109°F) in Riyadh and 27° to 38°C (80° to 100°F) in Jeddah. Nighttime temperatures in the central deserts can be famously chilly even in summer, as the sand gives up daytime heat rapidly once the sun has set. Annual precipitation is usually sparse (up to 100 mm or 4&nbsp;[[inch]]es in most regions), although sudden downpours can lead to violent [[flash flood]]s in [[wadi]]s. Annual rainfall in Riyadh averages 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;inches) and falls almost exclusively between January and May; the average in Jeddah is 54&nbsp;mm (2.1&nbsp;inches) and occurs between November and January.

==Economy==
[[Image:AramcoCoreArea.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]], the Saudi national oil company, whose main offices are in [[Dhahran]].]]
{{main|Economy of Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia's economy is Petroleum-based; roughly 75% of budget revenues and 90% of export earnings come from the oil industry. The oil industry comprises about 45% of Saudi Arabia's [[gross domestic product]], compared with 40% from the private sector (see below). Saudi Arabia has claimed to be in possession of 260.1 billion barrels of [[oil reserves]] (about 24% of the world's proven total petroleum reserves) as of 2003 {{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Moreover, according to the Saudi government, the proven reserves increase gradually as more [[oil field]]s are discovered and oil recovery improves with technology. These reserve figures have been contested and may be significantly lower {{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

The government is attempting to promote growth in the private sector by privatizing industries such as power and telecom. Saudi Arabia announced plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies in [[1999]], which followed the ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company. Shortages of water and rapid population growth may constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural products.

In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income has fallen from $25,000 in [[1980]] to $8,000 in [[2003]], up from about $7,000 in [[1999]]. The decline in inflation-adjusted [[Per capita income|per-capita income]] from 1980 to 1999 set a record, being by far the worst such decline suffered by any nation-state in history. {{Fact|date=March 2007}}

In 2003, the price of oil jumped to record high of 40 to 50 dollars, which triggered a second oil boom.  Saudi Arabia's budget surplus has crossed $28 billion (110SR billion) in 2005. [[Tadawul]] (the Saudi stock market Index) finished 2004 with a massive 76.23% to close at 4437.58 points. [[Market capitalization]] was up 110.14% from a year earlier to stand at $157.3 billion (589.93SR billion), which makes it the biggest stock market in the [[Middle East]].‏

OPEC limits its members oil production based on its "proven reserves."  The higher their reserves, the more OPEC allows them to produce.  Over the past fifteen years, Saudi Arabia's claimed reserves have been flat, with the exception of an increase of about 100 billion barrels between 1987 and 1988.  Many experts now believe that Saudi Arabia is greatly exaggerating its reserves and may soon show production declines (see [[peak oil]]){{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

To diversify the economy, Saudi Arabia launched a new city on the western coast with investments exceeding 26.6 billion dollars. The city which is named "[[King Abdullah Economic City]]" will be built near al-Rabegh industrial city north to Jeddah. The new city, where construction work started in December 2005, includes a port which is the largest port of the kingdom. Extending along a coastline of 35&nbsp;km, the city will also include petrochemical, pharmaceutical, tourism, finance and education and research areas.

Saudi Arabia officially became a [[World Trade Organization]] member in December 2005.

===Foreign labour===
Many men and women from [[South Asia|South]], [[South East Asia|South East]] (Philippines, Pakistan, Indonesia, India), and [[East Asia]], [[East Africa]] (Egypt) and the [[Middle East]] seek work in Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/saudi0704/saudi0704.pdf |title=Bad Dreams: Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia (PDF)|publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=July 2004 |accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> There are also some people from [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Europe]]. Hundreds of thousands of low-[[skilled workers]] and skilled workers from regions of the [[Developing countries|developing world]] migrate to Saudi Arabia, sometimes only for a short period of time, to work.  Although exact figures are not known, skilled experts in the [[banking]] and services professions seek work in the Kingdom.

It is reported that some [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] present in the country are sometimes subject to mistreatment, as documented by [[Human Rights Watch]]:

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia's population as of July 2006 is estimated to be about 27,019,731, including about 5,576,076 resident foreigners. Until the 1960s, a majority of the population was [[nomadic]]; due to rapid economic and urban growth, more than 95% of the population now is settled. The birth rate is 29.56 births per 1,000 people. The death rate is only 2.62 deaths per 1,000 people. Some cities and oases have densities of more than 1,000 people per square kilometer (2,600/sq&nbsp;mi).

Around 85 percent of Saudis are ethnically [[Arab]]. Approximately 12% of the population is [[South Asia]]n or of South Asian Descent, including Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis. In addition, there are some citizens of [[Asian]] and [[sub-Saharan]]/[[East Africa]]n ancestry. Many Arabs from nearby countries are employed in the kingdom. There are over seven million migrants from countries all around the world, including:<ref>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51609.htm</ref> [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian]]: 1.4 million, [[Bangladeshi]]: 1 million, [[Filipino people|Filipino]]: 950,000, [[Pakistan]]i: 900,000, [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]]: 900,000, [[Yemeni]]: 800,000, [[Indonesians|Indonesian]]: 500,000, [[Sri Lankan]]: 350,000, [[Sudanese]]: 250,000, [[Syrian]]: 100,000 and [[Turkish people|Turkish]]: 80,000.  There are around 100,000 [[Western world|Westerners]] in Saudi Arabia, most of whom live in [[Compound (fortification)|compound]]s or [[Gated community|gated communities]]. 

Saudi Arabia expelled 800,000 Yemenis in 1990 and 1991 to punish [[Yemen]] for its opposition to the war against [[Iraq]]. An estimated 240,000 [[Palestinians]] are living in Saudi Arabia. They are not allowed to hold or even apply for Saudi citizenship, as the new law passed by Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers in October 2004 (which entitles [[expatriates]] of all nationalities who have resided in the kingdom for ten years to apply for citizenship, with priority being given to holders of degrees in various scientific fields) has one glaring exception: Palestinians will not be allowed to benefit from the new law because of [[Arab League]] instructions barring the Arab states from granting them citizenship in order "to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right to return to their homeland".

The Saudi government states that all citizens must be Muslim. The majority of the population adheres to a theological interpretation within Islam most commonly known as [[Salafism]] or  [[Wahhabism]]. The [[Shia population]] of the country is estimated at around 15 percent,<ref>http://www.cfr.org/publication/10903/shiite_muslims_in_the_middle_east.html</ref> primarily in the eastern provinces, and larger cities.

The country allows religious minorities such as [[Christian]]s and [[Hindu]]s to enter the country as temporary workers, but does not allow them to practice their faiths in public places or to engage in any proselytizing activity. The U.S. State Department suggests that there are 500,000 to 1 million people who adhere to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith.

==Education==
At the time the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932, education was not accessible to everyone and limited to individualized instruction at religious schools in mosques in urban areas. These schools taught Islamic law and basic literacy skills. By the end of the century, Saudi Arabia had a nationwide educational system providing free training from preschool through university to all citizens. The modern Saudi educational system provides quality instruction in diverse fields of modern and traditional arts and sciences. This diversity helps meet the Kingdom's growing need for highly-educated citizens to build on its rapid progress.  

Formal primary education began in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s. By 1945, King Abdulaziz bin Abdelrahman Al-Saud, the country's founder, had initiated an extensive program to establish schools in the Kingdom. Six years later, in 1951, the country had 226 schools with 29,887 students. In 1954, the Ministry of Education was established, headed by then Prince Fahd bin Abdulaziz as the first Minister of Education. The first university, now known as King Saud University, was founded in Riyadh in 1957.

Today, Saudi Arabia's nationwide public educational system comprises Twenty universities, more than 24,000 schools, and a large number of colleges and other educational and training institutions. Open to every citizen, the system provides students with free education, books and health services. Over 25 percent of the annual State budget is for education including vocational training. The Kingdom has also worked on scholarship programs to send students overseas, mainly to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]] and other nations. Over the past couple of years, thousands of students have been sent to higher-educations programs each year.

The study of Islam remains at the core of the Saudi educational system.  The Islamic aspect of the  Saudi national curriculum is examined in a recent report by [[Freedom House]].<ref>http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/news/bn2005/bn-2005-2006-05-23.htm</ref>  The report finds how, in religious education classes (in any religious school), children are taught to deprecate other religions, in addition to other branches of Islam. The Saudi religious studies curriculum is taught outside the Kingdom in [[madrassas]] throughout the world.

==Sports==
Men can often be found playing sports. Women rarely participate in sports, and always away from the presence of men; this often leads to indoor gyms. Even though [[football (soccer)|football]] (soccer) is the most popular sport, Saudi Arabia has recently participated in the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and in international competitions in [[volleyball]] and other sports. The [[Saudi Arabia national football team]] is often most known for being in four consecutive times in the [[FIFA World Cup]] and six times in the [[AFC Asian Cup]], which the team won three times and was runner-up two times.  Some popular football players include [[Majed Abdullah]], [[Mohamed Al-Deayea]], [[Sami Al-Jaber]], and [[Saeed Al-Owairan]].

{{main|Culture of Saudi Arabia|Music of Saudi Arabia|Islam in Saudi Arabia|Cinema of Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabian culture revolves around the religion of [[Islam]]. Islam's two holiest sites, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], are located in the country. Every day, five times a day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. The weekend consists of Thursday and Friday. The public practice of any religion other than Islam, including Christianity and Judaism, the presence of churches, and possession of non-Islamic religious materials is not allowed exept in Aramco coumpounds in which many expatriots attend church services.  

One of Saudi Arabia's most compelling folk rituals is the [[Al Ardha]], the country's national dance. This [[sword dance]] is based on ancient [[Bedouin]] traditions: drummers beat out a rhythm and a poet chants verses while sword-carrying men dance shoulder to shoulder. [[Al-sihba]] folk music, from the [[Hijaz]], has its origins in [[al-Andalus]]. In [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jeddah]], dance and song incorporate the sound of the [[mizmar]], an [[oboe]]-like [[woodwind instrument]]. The [[drum]] is also an important instrument according to traditional and tribal customs.

Saudi Arabian dress follows strictly the principles of [[hijab]] (the Islamic principle of [[modesty]], especially in dress) The predominantly loose and flowing but covering garments reflect the country's large desert country. Traditionally, men usually wear an ankle-length shirt woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by a cord coil) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by a cord coil) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. Women's clothes are decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques. However, Saudi women must wear a long cloak ([[abaya]]) and veil ([[niqāb]]) when they leave the house to protect their modesty. The law does not apply to foreigners at such a high degree, but both men and women are told to dress modestly.  

[[Islamic dietary laws]] forbid the eating of [[pork]] and the drinking of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and this law is enforced strictly throughout Saudi Arabia. Arabic unleavened bread, or [[Khubz|khobz]], is eaten with almost all meals. Other staples include [[lamb]], [[Chicken (food)|grilled chicken]], [[falafel]] (deep-fried [[chickpea]] balls), [[shawarma]] (spit-cooked sliced [[lamb]]), and [[Ful medames]] (a paste of [[Vicia faba|fava beans]], [[garlic]] and [[lemon]]). Traditional [[coffeehouse]]s used to be ubiquitous, but are now being displaced by food-hall style cafes. Arabic [[tea]] is also a famous custom, which is used in both casual and formal meetings between friends, family and even strangers. The tea is black (without milk) and has herbal flavoring that comes in many variations.

Public theatres and [[movie theater|cinemas]] are prohibited, as Wahhabi tradition deems those institutions to be incompatible with Islam. However, in private compounds such as [[Dhahran]] and [[Ras Tanura]] public theaters can be found, but often are more popular for local music, arts, and theatre productions rather than the exhibition of motion pictures. Recently, plans for some cinemas that will be allowed  to feature Arabic cartoons for women and children were announced {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. DVDs of western movies are legal and widely available and [[IMAX]] theatres are also legal[http://www.scitech.com.sa/IMAX.html]. The cultural heritage is celebrated at the annual [[Jenadriyah]] cultural festival.

Some Saudi [[novelists]] have had their books published in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] because of [[censorship]] in Saudi Arabia. Despite signs of increasing openness, Saudi novelists and [[artists]] in [[film]], [[theatre]], and the [[visual arts]] face greater restrictions on their freedom of expression than in the West. Contemporary Saudi novelists include:

* [[Abdelrahman Munif]] (exiled, now deceased)
* Yousef Al-Mohaimeed
* Abdu Khal
* Turki Al-Hamad (subject of a [[fatwa]] and death threats)
* Ali al-Domaini (in jail)
* Ahmed Abodehman (now writes in French)
* Rajaa Al Sanie
