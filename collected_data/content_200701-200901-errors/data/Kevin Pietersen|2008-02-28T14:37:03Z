'''Kevin Peter Pietersen''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born [[27 June]] [[1980]] in [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], [[South Africa]]) is an English [[cricket]]er. He is an attacking right-handed [[batsman]] and occasional [[off spin]] [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] who plays for [[Hampshire County Cricket Club]] and is a member of both the [[English cricket team|England]] [[Test cricket|Test match]] and [[One Day International]] teams. 

He made his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut for [[KwaZulu Natal cricket team|Natal]] in 1997 before [[International cricketers of South African origin|moving to England]] after voicing his displeasure at the [[racial quota]] system in place in South Africa,<ref name="cricinfo">[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/19296.html Kevin Pietersen biography], [[Cricinfo]]. Retrieved on [[2007-05-28]].</ref> and in order to further his opportunities for playing at international level.  Being born of an English mother gave Pietersen eligibility to play for England, and after serving a qualifying period of four years playing at [[county cricket|county]] level, he was called up almost immediately into the national side. He made his international debut in the One-day International match against [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 2004,<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/8/8063/One-Day_International_Matches.html One-day International Matches played by Kevin Pietersen], [[Cricketarchive]].

==Early and personal life==
Born of an [[England|English]] mother and an [[Afrikaner]] father, Penny and Jannie<ref name="cricinfo"/> Pietersen had a strict and well-disciplined childhood, along with his three brothers Tony, Greg and Bryan;<ref>[http://kevin-pietersen.tripod.com/id1.html The Man with the Hair].

Pietersen attended [[Maritzburg College]], [[Pietermaritzburg]], and made his [[first-class cricket]] debut for [[KwaZulu Natal cricket team|Natal]]'s B team in 1997, aged 17, where he was regarded predominantly as an [[off spin]] bowler and a hard-hitting lower-order batsman.<ref name="Brenkley2">Brenkley, Stephen.

Pietersen is widely portrayed in the media as having a self-assured personality, described by [[Geoffrey Boycott]] as being "cocky and confident".<ref>Boycott, Geoffrey.

==Domestic career==
He impressed members of [[Nasser Hussain]]'s England side when playing for [[KwaZulu Natal cricket team|KwaZulu Natal]] in 1999; he took four top-order wickets and, despite batting at number nine, scored 61 [[not out]] from 57 balls, hitting four sixes.<ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1999-2000/ENG_IN_RSA/SCORECARDS/ENG_KZN_03-06DEC1999.html KwaZulu-Natal v England XI 3-6 December 1999], Cricinfo.

Despite the praise from the England side, Pietersen was dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen felt that this was due to the country's [[racial quota]] system, in which provincial sides were required to have at least four non-white players.<ref name="cricinfo"/><ref name="storm">"[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/270556.html Pietersen in the eye of a storm]", Cricinfo, [[2006-12-01]].

In 2000, [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] coach [[Clive Rice]], who had seen Pietersen play in 1997 in South Africa at a schools week, heard that Pietersen was playing club cricket in Birmingham and offered him a three-year contract to play for the county.<ref name="notts"/>  His maiden first-class century came on his Nottinghamshire debut against [[Loughborough UCCE]].<ref name="kpzone">Collins, Sam.

After Nottinghamshire were relegated in 2003, Pietersen requested a release from his contract, saying "I haven't been happy for a while....The pitch at [[Trent Bridge]] has been one of my problems...

<blockquote>During the game I told the captain that I was not happy and that I wanted to leave. After the game we spoke in the dressing room and then I went to have dinner. I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment. I was told the captain had said, 'if he does not want to play for Notts he can f*** off.'

After becoming a regular in the international side, Pietersen rarely gets an opportunity to play domestic cricket. Having an England "central contract" means that Pietersen is only released to play for Hampshire at the discretion of the national coach. After being left out of the national side to face [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] in May 2005, Pietersen had several good innings in the four-day county championship, including two centuries.<ref>"[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/209752.html Pietersen posts another reminder]", Cricinfo, [[2005-05-21]].
