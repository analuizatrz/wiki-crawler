'''Rockell''' (born '''Rachel Alexandra Mercaldo''' on [[March 4]], [[1977]] in [[Long Island]], [[New York]]) is a [[Freestyle music]], [[Dance music|Club/Dance]], [[Hi-NRG]] and [[Dance-Pop|Pop]] [[singer-songwriter]]. 

==Music career==
In the late 1990s, she had major dance hits with the songs "In A Dream," "When I'm Gone," and "Can't We Try" (a duet with [[Collage (singer)|Collage]] and remake of the [[Dan Hill]] and [[Vonda Shepard]] 1987 hit song). All of these tracks appeared on her 1998 debut album entitled ''[[What Are You Lookin' At?]]''. She released a second album, ''[[Instant Pleasure]]'', in 2000. ''Instant Pleasure'' included the single "What U Did 2 Me" which reached #101 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart in 2001.  Her best charting success is in Canada, where she is still active performing shows at clubs.  Her debut single "I Fell in Love" distributed by the then [[BMG]] Canada hit #1 on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] while the follow-up mega hit "In a Dream" was at #6 and is still a dance club anthem and a favourite amongst freestyle music enthusiasts nationwide.

==Chart success==
In 1996, "I Fell In Love" peaked at #61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in early 1997.  It hit the #1 spot on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] singles chart during that year, making it the most successful freestyle dance music single of the decade in [[Canada]]. The single also peaked at #9 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart in the USA.

"In A Dream," the follow-up to "I Fell In Love," peaked at #72 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in late 1997. It was #6 on the Hot 100 [[Canadian Singles Chart]] and solidified Rockell's position on the artist roster of the then [[BMG Music Canada]]. It also peaked at #13 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.

"Can't We Try" with Collage peaked at #59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1998. The single peaked at #11 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.

"When I'm Gone" bubbled under the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1999, whereas it made a huge smash on both the [[Hot Dance Airplay]] and [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] charts. It also peaked at #21 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.

Rockell's lead-off single to her second album ''[[Instant Pleasure]]'', "What U Did 2 Me," bubbled under the [[Billboard Hot 100]] at #101; however, it was her best selling (and arguably biggest hit) single and it garnered her a music video. It fared much better on [[Hot Dance Airplay]] and [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] charts.

She also released "The Dance" (a cover of the [[Garth Brooks]] hit) and "Tears," but neither of these singles charted on the Hot 100. Both singles performed well on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] and [[Hot Dance Airplay]] charts. "The Dance" peaked at #27 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart and "Tears" peaked at #16 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.

==Recent times==
In 2005, she came back with "L.O.V.E.", produced by [[DJ Mickey Bono]]. A limited independent release that had a trance remix by Lenny "Linus" Douglas and freestyle remixes by Russ Castella and Randy Weber Taylor, the original writer/producer of "In a Dream". It became a modest [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart hit. It also received some dance radio airplay.

Spring 2007, saw Rockell back in the studio recording a new single, "Playing My Love." It was released to Dance/[[Rhythmic]] format radio in July 2007.  A long awaited freestyle remix by Salsation 3 was released just in time for the holidays in November 2007, giving "Playing My Love" longevity through 2008.  A nationwide tour with several dance artists including Joe Zangie was announced as well.

In November 2007, Rockell released a new dance single with Canada's Odeon Records, "You Keep Me Hanging On," a remake of [[the Supremes]]' original and [[Kim Wilde]]'s 1987 [[You Keep Me Hangin' On|mega hit]].
