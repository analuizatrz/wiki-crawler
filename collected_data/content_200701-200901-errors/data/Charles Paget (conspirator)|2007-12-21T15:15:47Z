'''Charles Paget''' (''c.'' [[1546]]&ndash;[[1612]]) was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] conspirator, involved in the [[Babington plot]] to [[assassination|assassinate]] [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] of [[England]].

He was also a double agent working for Sir [[Francis Walsingham]].<ref>[http[://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk Charles Paget in The National Archives]</ref>

In [[1586]], [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]] was accused by the [[British Government]] of having received and written letters about a plot to assassinate [[Queen Elizabeth]]. Paget, alongside with [[Thomas Morgan (of Llantarnam)|Thomas Morgan]], was named in Mary's trial as one of the correspondents, and a letter to him dated [[17 July]] [[1586]] formed part of the evidence at her trial. Queen Elizabeth demanded Paget's extradition from France, and threatened to have him [[assassinate]]d if he remained.

Early in [[1588]], Paget moved to [[Brussels]], where he remained for the next eleven years, until [[13 July]] 1603, when he returned to [[Paris]] after the death of Queen Elizabeth when it was safe for him to do so.  He was able to recover both his manor at [[Weston-on-Trent]] and a [[pension]] from King James. He died at the beginning of [[February]] [[1612]],<ref name=Holmes>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21103?docPos=2 Peter Holmes: "Charles Paget"] in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''.</ref> leaving his lands to the sons of one of his sisters, the Roper family. <ref>Kelly's Directory of the Counties of Derby, Notts, Leicester and Rutland. London, 1891</ref> It was Anthony Roper who built the hall at Weston.

==Biography==
Born around [[1546]], Charles Paget was the younger son of the English statesman [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|William Paget, the first Baron Paget]] and his wife, Anne, the daughter of Henry Preston. He was at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] when [[Queen Elizabeth I]] visited the university in [[August]] [[1564]], but left without taking a degree. Around [[1581]], he went to [[France]], to avoid the [[religious persecution]] in [[England]].<ref name=Holmes/>

Under his father's will he became entitled to the [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Weston-on-Trent|Weston]]-[[Aston-on-Trent|Aston]] and other lands in [[Derbyshire]].<ref name=dnb> He was a zealous [[Roman Catholic]], and left England, in discontent with its ecclesiastical [[constitution]], around [[1572]], and fixed his residence in [[Paris]]. There he became secretary to [[James Beaton]], [[archbishop of Glasgow]], who was Queen Mary Stuart's [[ambassador]] at the French court, and he was soon joined in the office with [[Thomas Morgan]] ([[1543]]-[[1606]] ?) Morgan and Paget were in constant correspondence with [[Claude de la Boisseliere Nau]] and [[Gilbert Curie]], the two secretaries who lived with the queen in England, and ''they four governed from thenceforth all the queen's affairs at their pleasure.'' Paget and Morgan secretly opposed [[James Beaton|Archbishop Beaton]], Mary's ambassador, and wrung from him the administration of the queen's dowry in France, which was about thirty million crowns a year. Joining themselves afterwards with Dr. [[Owen Lewis]] in Rome, and falling out with Dr. Allen and Father Parsons, they were the cause of much division among the catholics<ref>PARSONS, Story of Domesticall Difficulties, Stonyhurst MS. No. 413, quoted in Records of the English Catholics, ii. 320 n.)</ref> Parsons states that the original cause of Paget and Morgan's division from Dr. Allen and himself was their exclusion, by desire of  [[Charles, Duke of Guise]] and the Archbishop of Glasgow, from the consultation held at Paris in [[1582]] relative to the deliverance of the [[Queen of Scots]], and the restoration of England to catholic unity by means of a foreign invasion (ib. ii. 392). Thenceforward Paget and Morgan inspired Mary with distrust of [[Spain]] and the [[Jesuits]]. 

During all this time, while apparently plotting against Queen Elizabeth, Paget was acting the part of a spy, and giving political information to her ministers. In [[8 January]] [[1581]]-[[1582]] he wrote from Paris to [[Secretary of State]], [[Frances Walsingham]] in these terms : 
<blockquote>
''God made me known to you in this town, and led me to offer you affection ; nothing can so comfort me as her Majesty's and your favour.'' 
</blockquote>
Again he wrote, on [[28 September]] 1582 : 
<blockquote>
''In my answer to her Majesty's command for my return to England, assist me that she may yield me her favour and liberty of conscience in religion. . . . If this cannot be done, then solicit her for my enjoying my small living on this side the sea, whereby I may be kept from necessity, which otherwise will force me to seek relief of some foreign prince.''
</blockquote>

On [[23 October]] 1582 he informed Walsingham of his intention to go to [[Rouen]] for his health, and to drink English [[beer]]. He professed dutiful allegiance to Elizabeth, and his readiness to be employed in any service, matter of conscience in religion only excepted.

==Secret visit to England==
In [[September]] [[1583]] Paget came privately from Rouen to England, assuming the name of Mope. It is alleged that the object of his journey was to concert measures for an invasion by the [[Duke of Guise]] and the [[King of Scots]]. For a time he lay concealed in the house of William Davies, at [[Patching]], Sussex. On the [[8 September]] he had an interview at [[Petworth]] with the [[Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]. He was afterwards secretly conveyed to a lodge in the [[earl]]'s park, called Conigar Lodge, where he stayed for about eight [[day]]s. His brother, [[Lord Paget]], was summoned to Petworth, where Charles and the earl had several conferences. On the [[16 September]], Charles Paget met in a wood, called Patching Copse, [[William Shelley (traitor)|William Shelley]],, who was subsequently convicted of treason. <ref>(Earja de Secrctis, pouch 47) cited by DNB</ref> 

[[Thomas Paget, 3rd Baron Paget de Beaudesert|Lord Paget]], writing to his brother on [[25 October]] in the same year, said his stay in Rouen was more misliked than his abiding in Paris, considering that he consorted with men like the [[John Lesley|Bishop of Ross]]. He added that
<blockquote>
''he was sorry to hear by some good friends that he carried himself not so dutifully as he ought to do, and that he would disown him as a brother if he forgot the duty he owed to England.'' 
</blockquote>
From this letter it would seem that Lord Paget's interview with his brother at Petworth must have been of a more innocent character than has been generally supposed. However, about the end of November Lord Paget fled to Paris, and thenceforward became suspected of complicity in all his [[brother]]'s [[treason]]s. On [[2 December]] 1583, Sir [[Edward Stafford]], the English ambassador to France, wrote from Paris to Sir Fances Walsingham :
<blockquote>
'' Lord Paget, with Charles Paget and Charles Arundel, suddenly entered my dining chamber before any one was aware of it, and [[Lord Paget]] says they came away for their consciences, and for fear, having enemies.'' They also told him that ''for all things but their consciences they would live as dutifully as any in the world.''
</blockquote> 

From this period Charles Paget, in conjunction with Morgan and other malcontents at home and abroad, continued their machinations, which were, of course, well known to the English government; and in [[June]] [[1584]] Stafford, the English ambassador, made a formal demand, in the name of Queen 
Elizabeth, for the surrender of Lord Paget, Charles Paget, Charles Arundel, [[Thomas Throckmorton]], and Thomas Morgan, they having conspired against the life of the English queen. The [[king of France]], however, refused to deliver them up, although he soon afterwards imprisoned Morgan, and forwarded his papers to Queen Elizabeth. 

[[Image:Babington postscript.jpg|thumbnail|right|Walsingham's "Decypherer" forged this [[cipher]] postscript to Mary's letter to Babington. It was this cipher that Paget in his letter of [[31 January]] had claimed to interpret.]]
It is clear that Paget was regarded with the utmost distrust and suspicion by Walsingham, who, in a despatch sent to Stafford on [[16 December]] [[1584]], says : ''Charles Paget is a most dangerous instrument, and I wish, for 
Northumberland's sake, he had never been born.'' In [[May]] [[1586]] Paget, on account of illness, went to the baths of Spain. He was attainted of treason by act of parliament in [[1587]]. 

Although all his plots had signally failed, he appears still to have clung to the idea that the Protestant religion in England could be subverted by a foreign force. Writing under the signature of 'Nauris,' from Paris, to one Nicholas Berden alias Thomas Rogers, [[31 January]] [[1587]]-[[1588]], he observed, in reference to the anticipated triumph of the [[Spanish Armada]] : 
<blockquote>
'' When the day of invasion happens, the proudest Councillor or Minister in England will be glad of the favour of a Catholic gentleman.'' 
</blockquote>
In the same letter he stated that all Walsingham's [[alphabet]]s or [[ciphers]] had been interpreted by him.

==Brussels==
In [[March]] [[1587]]-[[1588]] he entered the service of the [[Philip II of Spain|king of Spain]], and went to reside at [[Brussels]]. His name appears in the list of English exiles in [[Flanders]] who refused to sign the address of the English fathers of the [[Society of Jesus]].<ref>Douay Diaries, p. 408 cited by DNB</ref> 

He continued his correspondence: 
<blockquote>
'' I am incited to boldness with you by your favour to my nephew Paget, and the good report I hear of your sweet nature, modesty, and wisdom. I desire ardently to do a service agreeable both to the queen and the king of Spain. I am under obligation to the one as an English subject, and 
to the other as a catholic prince who has relieved me in my banishment.'' 
</blockquote>
He added that 
<blockquote>
''His Highness ' was willing to treat with allies, and particularly \vith the queen, that the crowns of England and Spain might return to their old amity''<ref>(State Papers, Dom. Eliz. vol. cclxv. art, 63).</ref>
</blockquote>
On [[27 April]] 1598 he wrote from [[Liege]]to Thomas Barnes in London : ''I am unspeakably comforted that the queen inclines to listen to my humble suit. The profits of my land are worth £200 a year to myself; it is a lordship called Weston-upon-Trent. ... I cannot capitulate with the Queen; but the greater my offence has been, the greater is her mercy in pardoning and restoring me to my blood and living, showing the liberality which makes her famous, and obliging me to spend my life at her feet.'' <ref>ib. vol. cclxvi. art. 116) cited by DNB</ref>

==Paris and the Scottish faction==
The English [[Catholic]] exiles eventually split into two parties: one, called the Spanish faction, supporting the claims of the infanta to the English crown; while the other, denominated the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] faction, advocated the right of [[James VI of Scotland]]. Paget was the acknowledged head of the Scottish faction, and in [[1599]] he threw up his employment under the [[King of Spain]], and returned to [[Paris]]<ref>ib. vol. cclxxi, art. 74 cited by DNB</ref>. Among the State Papers<ref> (vol. cclxxi. art. 74) cited by DNB</ref> is a letter from a catholic in Brussels to his friend, a monk at [[Liege]], giving a detailed account of Paget and his 'practices.' The writer says that ''from the first hour that his years permitted him to converse with men, he has been tampering in broils and practices, betwixt friend and friend, man and wife, and, as his credit and craft increase, betwixt prince and prince.'' 

Animated by intense hatred of the Spanish faction, Paget lost no time after his arrival at Paris in putting himself in communication with Sir [[Henry Neville]] [q. v.], the English ambassador, who forwarded a detailed account of the circumstances to Sir [[Robert Cecil]] in a despatch dated [[27 June]] (O.S.) [[1599]]. Cecil seems to have been by no means anxious to encourage Paget, but Neville was more favorable to him. Paget said he felt himself slighted by the English government, but he nevertheless seems to have given from time to time important intelligence to Neville and to [[Ralph Winwood]] the succeeding ambassador at the [[Government of France|French court]]. His attainder appears to have been reversed in the first parliament of James I, probably by the act restoring in blood his nephew [[William Paget, 4th Baron Paget de Beaudesert|William, Lord Paget]], and it is presumed that he returned to England. His paternal estate, including the manor of Weston on Trent and other manors in Derbyshire, was restored to him on [[13 July]] [[1603]]; and on 18 August in the same year James I granted him [[Pound sterling|£200]] per annum<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=14988 British History on-line - Grants of James I] accessed [[23 October]] 2007</ref>, part of a fee-farm rent  reserved by a patent of Queen Elizabeth, bestowing the lands of [[Lord Paget]] on William Paget and his heirs. He died, probably in England, about the beginning of February [[1611]]-[[1612]], leaving a good estate to the sons of one of his [[sister]]s.

Clitheroe was the author, and he being dead, Charles Paget has paid for its printing' (Cal. State Papers, Dom. Eliz. [[1598]]-[[1601]], pp.456, 460). It appears that the latter part of the book was written by Paget.
