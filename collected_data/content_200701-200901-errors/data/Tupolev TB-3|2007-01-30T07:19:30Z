The '''[[Tupolev]] TB-3''' (Тяжелый бомбардировщик - ''Tyazholy Bombardirovschik'' - "heavy bomber", development name '''ANT-6''') was a heavy bomber aircraft which was deployed by the [[Soviet Air Force]] in the [[1930s]] and early [[1940s]]. It was an angular mid-wing monoplane with fixed landing gear based on the [[Tupolev TB-1]] design. The standard version was powered by four 610 kW [[Mikulin AM-34]] engines. A total of 818 TB-3s were built.

In [[World War II]], some were used as transports and even night bombers, but by then the aircraft was completely obsolete; they were retired after [[1942]]. The aircraft were also used as motherships in some of the [[Zveno experiments|Zveno]] [[parasite aircraft]] experiments. Prior to the war, the Soviets experimented with air-lifting [[T-37 tank]] and [[T-38 tank]]s by slinging them under the bellies of TB-3s.
