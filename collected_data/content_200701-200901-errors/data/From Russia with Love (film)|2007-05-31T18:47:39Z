'''''From Russia with Love''''' is the 2nd [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]] and the second to star [[Sean Connery]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]. It is based on the [[From Russia with Love|1957 novel]] by [[Ian Fleming]].  The world premiere was on October 10, [[1963 in film|1963]], at the Odeon, Leicester Square, London. In the film, James Bond is sent to [[Turkey]] to assist in the defection of Corporal Tatiana Romanova, where SPECTRE plans to get revenge for the killing of [[Dr. Julius No|Dr. No]].

It is considered the best of the James Bond film series by many fans and critics, and by actor Sean Connery (who restated his view in a 2002 interview with [[Sam Donaldson]] for [[ABC News]]). Although the film's low-key tone contrasts with the popular outlandishness of ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', ''From Russia with Love'' is often considered the ideal Bond film that each film strives to aim for. [[Michael G. Wilson]], the current co-producer of the series with his half sister [[Barbara Broccoli]], has stated "We always start out trying to make another ''From Russia with Love'' and end up with another ''Thunderball''." In 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time.

In 2005 it was adapted into a [[video game]], ''[[James Bond 007: From Russia with Love]]''. Produced by [[Electronic Arts]], the game featured all-new voice work by Sean Connery as well as his likeness and those of several of the film's supporting cast.

==Production==
As [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] had named ''[[From Russia with Love]]'' among his ten favourite books of all time, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to the cinematic debut of [[James Bond]], ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel was a [[Cold War]] thriller, however the producers made the villains [[SPECTRE]] instead of the [[Soviet]] undercover agency [[SMERSH]]. The film introduced the now standard pre-credits sequence, the use of a popular singer to sing the theme, and the line "James Bond will be back" in the credits.  Incidentally, the film is said to have been the last Kennedy saw before his assasination.

Although uncredited, the actor who 'played' [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], a.k.a. Number One of [[SPECTRE]] was [[Anthony Dawson]], the actor who had played Professor Dent in the previous Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', also directed by [[Terence Young]]. In the end credits, Blofeld was credited with a [[question mark]]. Blofeld's voice was provided by Viennese actor [[Eric Pohlmann]].

Reportedly, author and James Bond creator Ian Fleming makes a cameo in the Istanbul train scene (following Bond's stealing the LEKTOR decoder), standing outside on the right of the train, wearing grey trousers and a white sweater; some sources deny Fleming's appearance.

The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed later became the traditional [[screen test]] scene for prospective James Bond actors. This screen test forms part of the [[Ultimate Edition Dvd]] series, showing potential candidates auditioning for the role down the years: [[James Brolin]], [[Sean Bean]] and [[Sam Neill]] along with future 007 [[Pierce Brosnan]].  The scene has also been used to audition several James Bond leading ladies, including [[Maryam D'Abo]] and [[Maud Adams]].

==Plot==

In the pre-credits, the film opens in a late night time scene in a mansion garden where James Bond is alternately stalking and being stalked through an ornate garden by a tall, blond assassin. Bond is captured and stangled violently to death by the man named [[Red Grant]]. Suddenly, huge floodlights switch on and 'Bond' turns out to be a man wearing a Bond mask - it's all been a training exercise staged by SPECTRE. 

[[Kronsteen]], SPECTRE's chess [[grandmaster]] and master planner has devised a plot to steal a Lektor decoding device from the Russians, and embarrass the British Secret Service in revenge for the killing of their operative Dr. No. Ex [[SMERSH]] operative [[Rosa Klebb]] is placed in charge of the mission by the sinister [[Blofeld]] and has already chosen a female operative, a Russian cypher clerk at the Istanbul embassy and has been able to keep the fact of her own defection to SPECTRE a secret. Klebb departs to SPECTRE Island, the organisation's secret training base, to assess the murderous Donald [[Red Grant]], "a homicidal paranoiac".

In London, M tells Bond that Romanova, a cypher clerk at the Istanbul embassy, has contacted Station T in [[Turkey]], asking to defect with a Lektor device, which both [[MI6]] and the [[CIA]] have been after for years. It also appears that Romanova is claiming to be in love with Bond. Although he realizes that it's a trap, M decides that Bond should take on the mission anyway. 

After a brief flirtation with Moneypenny (during which M demands the return of a photograph of Romanova he had let Bond look at earlier, signing it, ''with love, from Russia''), Bond flies to [[Istanbul]] where he is followed both by an unkempt man in glasses and by Grant, on the way from the airport to meet Karim Bey, who is later almost murdered when a limpet mine attached to the wall of his house explodes.  
[[Image:KerimandBondIstanbul'63.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bond meets Kerim Bey]]    

Next day, after spying the assassin Krilencu from a giant underground system beneath the Russian [[consulate]] using a [[periscope]] they head for a rural gypsy settlement in the Turkish country where Bey has contacts.  However the gypsy camp is violently interrupted by the arrival of Krilencu's aggressive henchmen, who set about laying waste to the settlement amid much gunfire and struggling with knives. Grant is lurking nearby and shoots any man who looks like he might be about to kill Bond and eventually fight off the Bulgars. Bey, wounded in the attack, gets his revenge by killing Krilencu the next day with a sniper in a hotel behind a giant facade advertising the [[Bob Hope]] / [[Anita Ekberg]] movie [[Call Me Bwana]].    
    
When Bond returns to his hotel suite, he finds Romanova in bed waiting for him. Bond and Romanova make love, unaware that they are being filmed by Grant and Klebb.  
[[Image:Hagia-Sofia-Int-01s.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Bond visits the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Istanbul]]    
    
The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at a nearby [[Hagia Sophia]] [[mosque]]. Bond spies the scruffy, bespectacled man who had followed him from the Istanbul airport, but soon he is, unseen by Bond, killed by Grant. When Bond finds the body, he also finds the plans for the Russian Consulate he has been seeking leaving Bey highly suspicious of the simplicity of events.   
    
Bond arranges to meet Romanova on a [[ferry]] and records her telling him about the Lektor, which is later approved by [[MI6]] back in London. He applies for a visa from the Russian Consulate, allowing his access to the building. At a pre-arranged moment, Bey sets off an explosive charge in the chamber beneath the building releasing tear gas and in the resulting chaos, Bond is able to find Romanova and make off with the decoder on the Orient Express, pursued by Soviet security man Benz who recognises Romanova. Grant is already on the train. Bey and Benz are later both found dead in a compartment in which Bey had originally over powered him.
    
The train continues on its journey across southern-central [[Europe]], arriving at Beograd where Bond in meeting one of Bey's sons arranges for an agent from Station Y to meet him at [[Zagreb]]. However there Grant intercepts the British agent and then poses as agent Nash, boarding the train with Bond as it sets off again. In his cabin, Bond tells 'Nash' about the Lektor and about how difficult it will be to get it across the border. Bond becomes suspicious of 'Nash' when he witnesses him spiking Romanova's drink.    
    
[[Image:Grant 007.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Red Grant]]]] 
While she's unconscious in one part of the cabin, Grant knocks Bond out in the other half of the small cabin quarters and taunts Bond when he revives who realises that SPECTRE has been playing the Russians and the British off against each other, keeping him alive until he could get the Lektor device for them. He tells Bond that his death will be staged as a crime of passion and that they'll plant the film of Bond and Romanova making love on Romanova and a letter apparently from her threatening to release the film. However in one last attempt to save his life, Bond offers to buy his last cigarette for 50 gold sovereigns and dupes Grant into opening the booby trapped attaché case and eventually kills him after a violent struggle.  
[[Image:FromRussiahelicopter.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Somewhere in Yugoslavia the flower truck is attacked by a SPECTRE helicopter]]    

At Grant's pre-arranged escape point Bond leaves the train with a doped Romanova overpowering the SPECTRE operative in the flower truck and driving off into the Balkan countryside. They are unthwarted by a helicopter and soon board a powerboat heading for Venice, but are later intercepted by small fleet of [[power boat]]s armed with [[rifle]] [[grenade]]s. When their stray [[bullet]]s puncture several [[barrel]]s of [[fuel]] stored on his boat, Bond throws them overboard, pretending to surrender as he fires flares into the water which, now full of oil, explodes, engulfing the pursuing boats in flames. 
[[Image:007Russiaflaregun.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Bond with the flare gun as the barrels are ignited]]    
    
Finally, when Bond and Romanova arrive in Venice and check into a hotel, where Rosa Klebb disguised as a maid is trying to whisk the Lektor away from under his nose while he is making a phone call. However, Romanova disarms Klebb who tries to kick Bond with her own poison tipped toe-blade but is shot by Romanova. Bond quickly says "She had her kicks.". With their mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova take time for a romantic gondola trip and Bond throws the film of him and Romanova making love into the canal as the credits roll and the "From Russia With Love" main track plays.

==Vehicles and gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
*[[Attache case]] &mdash; Technically, James Bond's first gadget. The briefcase issued to 007 by Q-Branch contains a folding [[AR-7]] [[sniper rifle]] with twenty rounds of ammunition, a pop-out flat throwing knife and fifty [[gold sovereign]]s for bribery/a hard currency reserve in secret compartments accessible from inside the case. In addition, the case has a trick safety mechanism that detonates a magnetically attached [[tear gas]] bomb if it is improperly opened. This standard-issue item is also carried by Nash in the film (and so appropriated by Grant), and is obliquely mentioned in ''[[Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill]]''.
*[[Pager]] &mdash; Although ''From Russia with Love'' was filmed in the [[1960s]], before this gadget's invention, Bond carried one, enabling MI6 to contact him at once; also, Bond's Bentley automobile had a radio-telephone, a device some newspaper reporters had obtained in the 1950s. (Joe Martin of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' was pictured using one in an archive photo published in one of the paper's 1990s anniversary retrospectives.)
*Bug detector &mdash; A small device that is designed to detect the presence of a [[Telephone tapping|phone tap]] device in a normal telephone when placed against such a device.
*Tape recorder disguised as a camera.

The film notes the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Major Boothroyd, known as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], the character he would play in all but two of the series' films, until his death in [[1999]]. The Q character appeared in the previous film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', portrayed by actor Peter Burton, and addressed by M initially as Armourer (though 007's boss volunteers a "thank you, Major Boothroyd" after he demonstrates the Walther to Bond). The cast also features Robert Shaw, perhaps best known as Quint in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' ([[1975]]), as the villain Red Grant.
