A ''scorpion'' is an [[arthropod]] with eight legs. It is a member of the [[Arachnida]] class and belongs to the order ''Scorpiones''. There are about 2000 species of scorpions. They are found widely distributed south of [[Latitude|49° N]], except [[New Zealand]] and [[Antarctica]].

==Anatomy==

The cuticle makes a tough armor around the body. In some places it is covered with hairs that act like balance organs. An outer layer that makes them fluorescent green under [[ultraviolet light]] is called the hyaline layer. Newly molted scorpions do not glow until after their cuticle has hardened. The fluoresent hyaline layer can be intact in fossil rocks that are hundreds of millions of years old.

The body of a scorpion is divided into two segments: the [[cephalothorax]] (also called the prosoma) and the [[abdomen]]/opisthosoma. The abdomen consists of the [[mesosoma]] and the metasoma.

===Cephalothorax===
The cephalothorax, also called prosoma, is the scorpion's “head”, comprising the [[carapace]], [[eye]]s, [[chelicerae]] (mouth parts), [[pedipalp]]s ([[claw]]) and four pairs of [[arthropod leg|walking legs]].

===Mesosoma===
The mesosoma, the abdomen's front half, is made up of six segments. The first segment contains the [[sex organ|sexual organs]] as well as a pair of vestigial and modified appendages forming a structure called the genital operculum. The second segment bears a pair of featherlike [[sensor]]y organs known as the ''pectines''; the final four segments each contain a pair of [[book lung]]s. The mesosoma is [[armor]]ed with [[chitin]]ous plates, known as [[tergites]] on the upper surface and  [[sternites]] on the lower surface.

===Metasoma=== 
The metasoma, the scorpion's [[tail (anatomy)|tail]], comprising six segments (the first tail segment looks like a last mesosoman segment), the last containing the scorpion's [[anus]] and bearing the [[telson]] (the [[sting (biology)|sting]]). The telson, in turn, consists of the [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]], which holds a pair of [[venom]] glands and the hypodermic aculeus, the venom-injecting barb.

On rare occasions, scorpions can be born with two metasomata ([[tail]]s). Two-tailed scorpions are not a different species, but rather a genetic abnormality.<ref>http://www.sasionline.org/pepe.htm</ref>

==Reproduction==

Most scorpions reproduce sexually and most species have male and female individuals. While the majority of scorpion species reproduce sexually, some, such as ''[[Hottentotta hottentotta]]'', ''[[Liocheles australasiae]]'', ''[[Tityus columbianus]]'', ''[[Tityus metuendus]]'', ''[[Tityus serrulatus]]'', ''[[Tityus stigmurus]]'', ''[[Tityus trivittatus]]'', and ''[[Tityus urugayensis]]'', all reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]], a process in which unfertilized eggs develop into living [[embryo]]s. Parthenogenic reproduction starts following the scorpion's final moult to maturity and continues thereafter. Sexual reproduction is accomplished by the transfer of a [[spermatophore]] from the [[male]] to the [[female]]; scorpions possess a complex [[courtship]] and [[mating]] ritual to effect this transfer.

Mating starts with the [[male]] and [[female]] locating and identifying each other using a mixture of [[pheromones]] and [[oscillation|vibration]]al communication; once they have satisfied each other that they are of opposite sex and of the correct species, mating can commence.

The courtship starts with the male grasping the female’s pedipalps with his own; the pair then performs a "dance" called the "promenade à deux". In reality this is the male leading the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his [[spermatophore]]. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviours such as [[juddering]] and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's chelicerae--clawlike mouthparts--grasp the female's in a smaller more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps and in some cases injecting a small amount of his venom into her pedipalp or on the edge of her cephalothorax,<ref>Hickman, Roberts, Larson, L'anson, Integrated Principles of Zoology, 13th ed. McGraw Hill pp.380</ref> probably as a means of pacifying the female.

When he has identified a suitable location, he deposits the spermatophore and then guides the female over it. This allows the spermatophore to enter her [[genital opercula]], which triggers release of the sperm, thus fertilizing the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours and depends on the ability of the male to find a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. If mating goes on for too long, the female may eventually break off the process.

Once the mating is complete, the male and female quickly separate. The male will generally retreat quickly, most likely to avoid being cannibalized by the female, although sexual [[cannibalism]] is infrequent with scorpions.

==Birth and development==

[[Image:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|250px|right|thumb|''Compsobuthus werneri'' female with young]]

Unlike the majority of [[Arachnida]] species, scorpions are [[viviparous]]. The young are born one by one, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one [[ecdysis|moult]]. Before the first moult, scorplings cannot survive naturally without the mother, depending on her for protection and to regulate their moisture levels. Especially in species which display more advanced sociability (e.g ''[[Pandinus]]'' spp.), the young/mother association can continue for an extended period of time. The size of the litter depends on the species and environmental factors, and can range from two to 100+ scorplings.<ref>Lourenco W. R., 2000, Reproduction in scorpions, with special reference to parthenogenesis, European Arachnology, pp. 71-85</ref>

The young generally resemble their parents. Growth is accomplished by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton ([[ecdysis]]). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in [[instars]] (how many moults it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Moulting is effected by means of a split in the old [[exoskeleton]] which takes place just below the edge of the carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split; the pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the [[metasoma]]. When it emerges, the scorpion’s new [[exoskeleton]] is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called [[sclerotization]]. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce; as [[sclerotization]] occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.

==Life and habits==

Scorpions have quite variable lifespans and the actual lifespan of most species is not known. The age range appears to be approximately 4-25 years (25 years being the maximum reported life span in the species ''H. arizonensis'').

Scorpions prefer to live in areas where the temperatures range from 20°C to 37°C (68°F to 99°F), but may survive in the temperature range of 14°C to 45°C (57°F to 113°F).<ref>http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/53/3/547.pdf http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jvatitd/v12n1/28301.pdf</ref>

They  are [[nocturnal]] and [[fossorial]], finding shelter during the day in the relative cool of underground holes or undersides of rocks and coming out at night to hunt and feed. Scorpions exhibit [[photophobia|photophobic]] behavior, primarily to evade destruction by their predators such as birds, centipedes, lizards, mice, possums, and rats.<ref>http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/scorpions.htm</ref>

Scorpions are opportunistic predators of small arthropods and insects. They use their chela (pincers) to catch the prey initially. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with [[neurotoxic]] venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have a relatively unique style of eating using [[chelicerae]], small claw-like structures that protrude from the mouth that are found only in a handful of invertebrates, including [[spider]]s and [[Uropygid|vinegaroons]]. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion. Scorpions can only digest food in a liquid form; any solid matter (fur, [[exoskeleton]], etc) is disposed of by the scorpion.

==Venom==
All scorpion species possess [[venom (poison)|venom]]. In general, scorpion venom is described as [[Neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] in nature. One exception to this however is ''[[Hemiscorpius lepturus]]'' which possesses [[cytotoxic]] venom. The neurotoxins consist of a variety of small [[protein]]s as well as sodium and potassium [[cation]]s, which serve to interfere with neurotransmission in the victim. Scorpions use their venom to kill or paralyze their prey so that it can be eaten; in general it is fast acting, allowing for effective prey capture. The effects of the sting can be severe.

Scorpion venoms are optimized for action upon other [[arthropod]]s and therefore most scorpions are relatively harmless to [[human]]s; stings produce only local effects (such as pain, numbness or swelling). A few scorpion species, however, mostly in the family [[Buthidae]], can be dangerous to humans. Among the most dangerous are ''[[Leiurus quinquestriatus]]'', otherwise dubiously known as the deathstalker, which has the most potent venom in the family, and members of the genera ''[[Parabuthus]]'', ''[[Tityus]]'', ''[[Centruroides]]'', and especially ''[[Fattail scorpion|Androctonus]]'', which also have powerful venom. The scorpion which is responsible for the most human deaths is the ''[[Fattail scorpion|Androctonus australis]]'', or yellow fat-tailed scorpion of [[North Africa]]. The toxicity of ''A. australis''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s venom is roughly half that of ''L. quinquestriatus,'' but despite the common misconception ''A. australis'' does not inject noticeably more venom into its prey. The higher death count is simply due to its being found more commonly, especially near humans. Human deaths normally occur in the young, elderly, or infirm; scorpions are generally unable to deliver enough venom to kill healthy adults. Some people, however, may be [[allergic]] to the venom of some species. Depending on the severity of the allergy, the scorpion's sting may cause [[anaphylaxis]] and death. A primary symptom of a scorpion sting is numbing at the injection site, sometimes lasting for several days. Scorpions are generally harmless and timid, and only voluntarily use their sting for killing prey, defending themselves or in territorial disputes with other scorpions. Generally, they will run from danger or remain still. 

It should be noted that the family Buthidae, while containing perhaps the highest number of dangerous species, also contains many species that are not thought to be medically significant.

Scorpions are able to regulate how much venom is injected with each sting using striated muscles in the stinger, the usual amount being between 0.1 and 0.6 mg. There is also evidence to suggest that scorpions restrict the use of their venom using it only to subdue large prey, or prey that struggles. It has been found that scorpions have two types of venom: a translucent, weaker venom designed to stun only, and an opaque, more potent venom designed to kill heavier threats. This is likely because it is expensive in terms of energy for a scorpion to produce venom, and because it may take several days for a scorpion to replenish its venom supply once it has been exhausted.<ref> [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2081.htm Scorpion Sting]</ref><ref> [http://home.online.no/~janor/paper.htm Sting Use In Two Species of Parabuthus Scorpions (Buthidae)]</ref>

There is currently no equivalent of the [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]] because nobody has yet classified the levels of pain inflicted by different scorpion stings. This is probably because of the risk involved with some species, such as ''Androctonus australis'' or ''Leiurus quinquestriatus''. However, envenomation by a mildly venomous species like [[Pandinus imperator]] is similar to a bee sting in terms of the pain and swelling that results. A sting on the thumb from a relatively non-dangerous scorpion often feels like the victim has accidentally struck their [[thumb]] with a hammer whilst driving in a nail. A sting from a truly dangerous scorpion can feel much worse, as though the victim had hammered a nail right ''through'' their eye. As heat breaks down venom, the wound should be immersed in water as hot as the victim can withstand as soon as possible. Ice or cold water should never be used, despite the temptation. It should be noted that the physical effects of a sting from a medically significant scorpion are not limited to the pain inflicted: there can be [[bradycardia]], [[tachycardia]] or in severe cases [[pulmonary edema]].

The stings of North American scorpions are rarely serious and usually result in pain, minimal swelling, tenderness, and warmth at the sting site. However, the Arizona bark scorpion ([[Centruroides exilicauda]] or sculpturatus), which is found in Arizona and New Mexico and on the California side of the Colorado River, has a much more toxic sting. The sting is painful, sometimes causing numbness or tingling in the area around the sting. Serious symptoms are more common in children and include abnormal head, eye, and neck movements; increased saliva production; sweating; and restlessness. Some people develop severe involuntary twitching and jerking of muscles. Breathing difficulties may occur.
The stings of most North American scorpions require no special treatment. Placing an ice cube on the wound reduces pain, as does an ointment containing a combination of an antihistamine, an analgesic, and a corticosteroid. Centruroides stings that result in serious symptoms may require the use of sedatives, such as midazolam, given intravenously. Centruroides antivenom rapidly relieves symptoms, but it may cause a serious allergic reaction or serum sickness. The antivenom is available only in Arizona. In Trinidad the leaf juice of Eclipta prostrata is used for scorpion stings. Any effect of plants that are used against scorpion stings may be due to symptomatic relief – analgesic, antiinflammatory, antipruritic effects, in addition to other biological activities. Some compounds from plants used for general inflammation also inhibit enzymes (like phospholipase A2) from snake and scorpion venom. Some of these plant compounds are hypolaetin-8-glucoside and related flavanoids.

==Fossil record==
Scorpions have been found in many [[fossil record]]s, including coal deposits from the [[Carboniferous Period]] and in marine [[Silurian]] deposits. They are thought to have existed in some form since about 425–450 million years ago. They are believed to have an oceanic origin, with gills and a claw-like appendage that enabled them to hold onto rocky shores or [[seaweed]]. 

The ''[[eurypterida|eurypterids]]'', [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] creatures which lived during the [[Paleozoic]] era, share several physical traits with scorpions and are closely related to them. Various species of ''Eurypterida'' could grow to be anywhere from 10 cm (4 in) to 3 m (9.75 ft) in length. However, they exhibit [[anatomy|anatomical]] differences marking them off as a group distinct from their Carboniferous and recent descendants. Despite this, some refer to them as "sea scorpions."<ref>http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/arthropoda/chelicerata/eurypterida.html</ref> Their legs are thought to have been short, thick, tapering and to have ended in a single strong claw; it appears that they were well-adapted for maintaining a secure hold upon rocks or seaweed against the wash of waves, like the legs of shore-[[crab]].

==Geographical distribution==
[[Image:Bark Scorpion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Hadrurus spadix'' - Caraboctonidae, Hadrurinae]]
Scorpions are almost universally distributed south of 49° N, and their geographical distribution shows in many particulars a close and interesting correspondence with that of the [[mammal]]s, including their entire absence from [[New Zealand]]. The facts of their distribution are in keeping with the hypothesis that the order originated in the [[northern hemisphere]] and migrated southwards into the southern continent at various epochs, their absence from the countries to the north of the above-mentioned latitudes being due, no doubt, to the comparatively recent [[glaciation]] of those areas. When they reached [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]] was part of that continent; but their arrival in [[Australia]] was subsequent to the separation of New Zealand from the Austro-Malayan area to the north of it. 


In the United States, scorpions are most common in southern [[Arizona]] and in a swath of land extending through central [[Texas]] and central [[Oklahoma]]. The common striped scorpion, ''[[Centruroides vittatus]]'', reaches from northwest [[Mexico]] to southern [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], southern [[Missouri]], and [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]. Species of the genus ''[[Vaejovis]]'' are found from [[Florida]] north to [[Maryland]], the Carolinas, and [[Tennessee]], and as far west as [[Oregon]] and [[California]]. ''[[Paruroctonus boreus]]'' is found through the Northwest U.S. and into [[Canada]] (Southern Saskatchewan, Southern Alberta and the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia). Scorpions can be found in 31 different states in the U.S., including [[Hawaii]] (''[[Isometrus maculatus]]'').

Five colonies of scorpions (''[[Euscorpius flavicaudis]]'') have established themselves in southern [[England]] having probably arrived with imported fruit from [[Africa]], but the number of colonies could be lower now because of the destruction of their habitats. This scorpion species is small and completely harmless to humans.

==Suicide misconception==

The belief that scorpions commit suicide by stinging themselves to death when surrounded by [[fire]] is of considerable antiquity and is often prevalent where these animals exist. It is nevertheless untrue since the venom has no effect on the scorpion itself, nor on any member of the same species (unless the venom is injected directly into the scorpion's nerve ganglion—quite an unlikely event outside of the laboratory). The misconception may derive from the fact that scorpions are poikilotherms ([[cold-blooded]]): when exposed to intense heat their metabolic processes malfunction. This causes the scorpion to spasm wildly and this spasming may appear as if the scorpion is stinging itself. It is also untrue that [[alcohol]] will cause scorpions to sting themselves to death.

==Ultraviolet light==
[[Image:Sorpion Under Blacklight.jpg|thumb|250px|A scorpion under a [[Black light|blacklight]].  In normal lighting this scorpion appears black.]]

Scorpions are also known to glow when exposed to certain wavelengths of [[ultraviolet]] light such as that which is produced by a [[Black light|blacklight]].

==Cultural symbolism==

[[Image:Scorpion bowl iran.jpg|thumb|right|Bowl depicting scorpions. Excavated at Halilrud area. 3rd Millennium BC, [[Jiroft Kingdom]], [[Iran]]]]
The scorpion has had various meanings and representations in different cultures in history:

*In the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', [[Gilgamesh]] approaches mountains where scorpion-folk guard the entrance. Additionally, the [[Akkadians]] called the constellation [[Scorpius]], Girtab, meaning "the Seizer", or "Stinger" and "Place Where One Bows Down".
*In ancient Egypt, the scorpion was associated with the god [[Set (mythology)|Set]].
*The [[Falaknuma Palace]] of [[Hyderabad, India]], is laid out in the shape of a scorpion with the two pincers spreading out to the north as wings to the building.
*In [[Greek mythology]], the scorpion is conjured by the gods to hound and punish [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]. It is also said that when [[Perseus]] slew [[Medusa]], the blood that leaked out of her severed neck turned into scorpions and snakes as it hit the ground.
*From a Biblical quotation, it is the term for a severe Roman [[scourge]]. Hard material was fixed onto multiple thongs to give them a flesh-tearing bite [''1 Kings 12:11: ...My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions'']. The choice of the name testifies how much the hellish pain caused by the small animal is to be feared.
*The tail of the [[Persian folklore|Persian legendary]] monster [[manticore]] is a scorpion tail.

==Pest control==
{{Inappropriate tone|date=December 2007}}
Scorpions are difficult to control with [[pesticide]]s alone. Therefore, the first control strategy is to modify the area surrounding a house.

* Remove all trash, logs, boards, stones, bricks and other objects from around the home.
* Keep grass closely mowed near the home. Prune bushes and overhanging tree branches away from the house. Tree branches can provide a path to the roof for scorpions.
* Store garbage containers in a frame that allows them to rest above ground level.
* Never bring firewood inside the house unless it is placed directly on the fire.
* Install weather-stripping around loose fitting doors and windows.
* Plug weep holes in brick veneer homes with steel wool, pieces of nylon scouring pad or small squares of screen wire.
* Caulk around roof eaves, pipes and any other cracks into the home.
* Keep window screens in good repair. Make sure they fit tightly in the window frame. 

Wettable powder formulations provide better residual control for crawling pests when applying perimeter sprays.  When using [[pyrethroid]]s or other insecticides labeled for scorpion control, be sure to use the highest permissible label rate.

Apply pesticides around the foundation of the building and up to 1 foot above ground level on the exterior walls.  Also apply pesticides around doors, window eaves and other potential points of entry.  Cyfluthrin, [[bifenthrin]], [[deltamethrin]], and bendiocarb are effective pesticides.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12510887&dopt=Abstract</ref>

==In popular culture==
{{Cleanup|date=December 2007}}
*In the popular CW show "One Tree Hill" Haley James Scott's older sister Taylour, has a scorpion tattoo on her lower back, which she explains she got based on the myth of stinging itself to death when trapped in fire, saying it's a myth for them, but real for herself, so in it's own, symbolic.
*In the Command and Conquer universe, the [[Brotherhood of Nod]] uses the Scorpion as their symbol.
*In the [[Halo (series)|Halo]] video games, a large battle [[tank]] is called the Scorpion after its shape.
*In [[John Steinbeck]]'s [[The Pearl (novel)|The Pearl]], the attack of a scorpion on the protagonist's infant son sets the plot in motion.
*The [[Škorpion vz. 61|vz. 61]], a [[Czechoslovakia]]n [[submachine gun]], also known as the "Škorpion" from the Czech word for scorpion.
*[[Sasori]], a popular character in the manga/anime series [[Naruto]], is named after the Japanese word for scorpion.
*''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' character [[Scorponok]] transformed into a giant scorpion. He appears in the 2007 [[transformers (2007 film)|film adaptation]].
*In the 1980s Filmation series [[She-Ra: Princess of Power]], one of the villains of The Evil Horde is a woman with scorpion features named [[Scorpia (She-Ra)|Scorpia]].
