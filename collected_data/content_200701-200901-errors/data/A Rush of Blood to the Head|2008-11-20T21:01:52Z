'''''A Rush of Blood to the Head''''' is the second [[studio album]] by English [[alternative rock]] band [[Coldplay]], released on 26 August 2002 in the United Kingdom by record label [[Parlophone]]. Produced by the band and British record producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]], the recording of the album began a week after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, which gave the band a fresh perspective on songwriting. The songs featured in the album have a greater use of piano and guitar than Coldplay's debut album, ''[[Parachutes]]''.

The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in the United Kingdom and later placing at number seven of the country's 20&nbsp;biggest-selling albums in the 21st&nbsp;century. The [[British Phonographic Industry]] has since certified the album eight-times platinum for its accumulated sales of over 2.6&nbsp;million units. The album has spawned the hit singles "[[In My Place]]", "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]", "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]", and "[[God Put a Smile upon Your Face]]". ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' has been praised by the critics, considering it better than ''Parachutes''. It won the [[44th Grammy Awards|2002 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] and [[Record of the Year]] for the song "Clocks", becoming Coldplay's largest hit to date.

==Background==
[[Coldplay]] became popular in Europe and overseas with the release of their debut album, ''[[Parachutes]]'', and, in particular, one of its singles, "[[Yellow (song)|Yellow]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews/album_review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1242166|title=Parachutes: Coldplay|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> The album debuted on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number one, and "Yellow" gave the band their first taste of fame in North America. Despite this, while recording ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'', the band claim they did not feel [[sophomore slump]] pressure. However, when they began to speak to the press about their new work, things started to scare them: "Everyone's been saying, 'What do you think about the pressure?' ... Argh!"<ref name="CumberbacthOut">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1456997/08132002/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay: Going Out of My Head|last=Cumberbatch|first=Franklin|date=2002-08-13|work=VH1|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>

The band started recording the album in London a week after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, during which their "poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences".<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/><ref name="MossHeats">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451517/20011217/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Ready Second Album As 'Trouble' Heats Up|last=Moss|first=Corey|coauthors=Cornell, Jeff|date=2001-12-18|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in [[Liverpool]], where they recorded some of the songs on ''Parachutes''. Once there, vocalist [[Chris Martin]] said that they became obsessed with recording.<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/>

"[[In My Place]]" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's [[lead single]] because it was the track that made them want to record a second album following a "strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" three months after the success of ''Parachutes''. According to Martin "one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming."<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/> The band wrote more than 20&nbsp;songs for the album. Some of their new material, including "In My Place" and "Animals", was played live while the band were still touring ''Parachutes''.<ref name="MossHeats"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1439294/20010212/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Warm Up On U.S. Tour Opener|last=Nelson|first=Chris|date=2001-02-12|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> The album's title was revealed through a post on the band's official website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1475357|title=Coldplay Sets Album Title, June Gigs|last=Luerssen|first=John D.|date=2002-04-25|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>

==Recording==
During initial recording sessions in Liverpool, vocalist Chris Martin and guitarist [[Jonny Buckland]] worked alone, and only on weekends. Each Monday they would present the song ideas they had developed to their band mates.<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/> With ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' nearly completed, Martin went into the studio late one night and wrote a piano [[riff]] that he has stated "just came out". The band recognised that this early version of the song that would become "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]" was special the first time Martin played it to them. Reasoning that it was too late to include the song on the album, however, they recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] version and included it on a CD marked "Songs for #3", featuring unfinished tracks they intended to work on for their third studio album.<ref name="WiederhornRoad">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484768/20040202/coldplay.jhtml|title=Road To The Grammys: The Making Of Coldplay's 'Clocks'|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=2004-02-02|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref><ref name="WebbStory">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/story-of-the-song-clocks-coldplay-2002-876537.html|title=Story of the Song: 'Clocks', Coldplay (2002)|last=Webb|first=Robert|date=2008-07-25|publisher=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

By June 2002, the band completed ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' and was ready to hand it over to record label, [[Parlophone]]. However, the band thought their output sounded "rubbish" and reached an agreement with the label to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied with the  results.<ref name="WiederhornRoad"/><ref name="WebbStory"/>

Subsequently many songs were discarded because they sounded like they could have been on first album ''Parachutes''. Martin has claimed that making ''Parachutes II'' would have been uninteresting: "It would have shown that we're happy to sit back on what we'd done, and we're not. For us it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians." Such ambitions but the band under strain: "sometimes practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit".<ref name="WiederhornBleed">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457204/20020827/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Bleed For Beauty On A Rush Of Blood To The Head|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=2002-08-27|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> After headlining 2002's [[Glastonbury Festival]], Coldplay returned to the studio and worked on some tracks from the "Songs for #3" they had produced earlier. [[Phil Harvey (manager)|Phil Harvey]], the band's manager, heard "Clocks" and urged them to rework it immediately: "No, you must do that song now 'cause you're going on [in the lyrics] about urgency, and you're talking about keeping this song back. That doesn't make sense."<ref name="WiederhornRoad"/><ref name="WebbStory"/>

Martin has claimed that the album's [[title track]] is an homage to American singer-songwriter [[Johnny Cash]], whom he considered one of "the greatest&nbsp;... men with just guitars".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1611108|title=Cash 'Comes Around' On New 'American' Album|last=Orshoski|first=Wes|date=2002-08-16|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>

==Cover==
The [[cover art]] for ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' was designed by photographer Sølve Sundsbø. Sundsbø had been hired by fashion magazine ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'' in the late 1990s to produce something with a "technological feel, something all white". As an artist, he tried to do "stuff that hasn't been done before, which is virtually impossible"; he suggested taking shots using a [[3D scanner|three-dimensional scanning machine]].<ref name="BenedictusShot">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/feb/14/photography.art|title=Sølve Sundsbø's best shot|last=Benedictus|first=Leo|date=2008-02-14|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref>

The model for the shot wore an all-white makeup because it produces the "best results"; however, for the image, the model also wore a [[twill]]-coloured cape. The computer could not read the colours so it was replaced with spikes, and the head in the image was chopped because the machine only scanned 30&nbsp;centimetres. The editor of the magazine liked the image and eventually featured it in one of their publications.<ref name="BenedictusShot"/>

Martin saw the image in the magazine and approached Sundsbø for permission to use the image as the cover of ''A Rush of Blood to the Head''. For the album's [[single (music)|singles]], Martin asked Sundsbø what he could do; the latter suggested scanning the head of each member of the band.<ref name="BenedictusShot"/>

==Music and lyrics==

{{listen|filename=Coldplay - Clocks.ogg|title="Clocks"
|description=The musicscape of "Clocks" is mainly built around a [[piano]] [[riff]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{sample box end}}

The album includes "guitar-pop", [[ballad]]s, and acoustic songs featuring extensive use of guitar and piano. The [[U2]]-esque [[arena rock|epic rock]] of the album's opening track "Politik", the piano-driven "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]", and the loud guitars of "A Whisper" were seen as an extension of the band's musical range.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/music/2002/08/26/rush_of_blood.shtml|title=Coldplay - A Rush Of Blood To The Head|date=2002-08-26|work=[[BBC Music]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> 

Recording the album after the September 11 attacks gave the band a fresh perspective: "The new songs are reflective of new attitudes. [They tell listeners] not to be frightened. Anybody can achieve whatever they want to."<ref name="MossHeats"/> Most of the song lyrics are about urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: "Perhaps there's a bit more urgency on some of these songs. And that's born from all the places we've been and the thing's we've experienced." Martin has also explained, in relation to the theme of urgency, that the album's title means "doing something on impulse".<ref name="WiederhornBleed"/> Several songs on the album are about relationships. These tracks are based on reality, however, according to Martin, they were written with a fictional twist: "Songs are like [[fairy tale]]s: they have a beginning and an end and you can make it all work perfectly. Real life doesn't work like that".<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/>

==Release and reception==
The album was made available in August 2002, two months after its original release date.<ref name="WebbStory"/> Record label [[Parlophone]] released the album on August 26 in the United Kingdom. It was released on August 27 in the United States through [[Capitol Records]].  In 2008, Capitol released a remastered version of the album on a 180-gram vinyl record as part of the "From the Capitol Vault" series.

''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' has earned the band several awards from both the domestic and international music press. In 2002, it was awarded Best Album at the ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' Awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2328003.stm|title=Q Awards 2002: Winners|date=2002-10-14|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> In the same year, the band won two [[Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for the song "[[In My Place]]".<ref name="Grammy">{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Coldplay&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=Grammy Awards Winners|publisher=The Recording Academy|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> In 2003 ''A Rush of Blood...'' won Best British Album at the [[BRIT Awards]], and the following year the band earned their first [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] for the song "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2655109.stm|title=Brit Awards 2003: Winners|date=2003-02-21|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref><ref name="Grammy"/>

The album has also received other accolades.

===Critical reviews===
''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' has received acclaim from numerous European critics. Many of them felt it was better than previous effort ''Parachutes''. Alexis Petridis of the ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper wrote that the band's "new assurance is everywhere ... the timidity of ''Parachutes'' is nowhere to be found". He concludes, "It sounds like an album ready to take on the world, and win."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2002/aug/16/popandrock.artsfeatures|title=Coldplay: A Rush of Blood to the Head|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=2002-08-16|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

The album has also been lauded by international critics. [[Kelefa Sanneh]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the album, commenting that it is "one of the year's best albums" and describing it as "sparser, stranger and even catchier than its predecessor".<ref name="KelefaVertigo">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06EED7113AF937A2575BC0A9649C8B63|title=POP REVIEW; Vertigo From the Falsetto and 'Parachutes'|last=Sanneh|first=Kelefa|date=2002-08-14|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's Rob Sheffield, who was less happy with ''Parachutes'', said that "''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' is a nervier, edgier, thoroughly surprising album", adding, "where ''Parachutes'' was the clumsy diary of a high-strung kid, ''A Rush of Blood'' sounds more like a band with the confidence to test its own limits."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/coldplay/albums/album/171751/review/5943034/a_rush_of_blood_to_the_head|title=Coldplay: A Rush Of Blood To The Head|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=2002-08-26|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> MacKenzie Wilson of [[Allmusic]] echoed the above comments saying that it is a "strong album". Wilson, who compliments Martin for his "sharpened" [[falsetto]] and refined "haunting delivery" and Buckland for his "riveting guitar work", notes that "regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they've made an amazing record".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:t1abqj3qojfa~T1|title=A Rush of Blood to the Head: Coldplay|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision Company|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> Emma Pearse of the American newspaper ''[[The Village Voice]]'' has the same sentiments, stating that is it "a little edgier, trancier, and more conversational" compared to ''Parachutes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0238/pearse.php|title=New Shapes and Colors|last=Pearse|first=Emma|date=2002-09-17|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>
