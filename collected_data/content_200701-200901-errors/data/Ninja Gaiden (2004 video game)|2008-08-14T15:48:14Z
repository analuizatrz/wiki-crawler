'''''Ninja Gaiden''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Team Ninja]] for the [[Xbox]] video game console. It went through five years of development before its release by [[Tecmo]] in 2004, and has been progressively enhanced with a number of expansion packs and two remakes, '''''Ninja Gaiden Black''''' and '''''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'''''. The game follows the fictional story of [[Ryu Hayabusa]], a [[ninja]], in his quest to recover a stolen sword and avenge the slaughter of his clan.

Inspired by the [[Ninja Gaiden#NES trilogy|1990s ''Ninja Gaiden'' series]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the 2004 version is set in a re-imagined game world based on another Team Ninja creation, the [[Dead or Alive (series)|''Dead or Alive'']] series of [[fighting game]]s. Tecmo specifically targeted ''Ninja Gaiden'' at a non-[[Japanese people|Japanese]] audience, and despite difficulties in obtaining [[Video game content rating system|content ratings]] due to the game's graphic depictions of violence, it was generally well received, and 362,441 copies were sold in [[North America]] in the first month after its release. However, the game had to be censored for release in some regions, and Japanese sales were poor, with only 60,000 in the four months following its début.

Making use of the [[Xbox Live|Xbox's internet connectivity]], ''Ninja Gaiden'' was the focus of a series of [[Online game|online contests]] across North America, [[Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Record-breaking numbers of players took part, competing for places in the live final, which was held during the 2004 [[Tokyo Game Show]]. Noted for its fluid and responsive control system, technical merit, and the significant challenge it offers to even experienced gamers, ''Ninja Gaiden'' is regarded by several critics as one of the best and most difficult games ever made. Team Ninja continued to update the game after its release: two ''Hurricane Packs'' were made available for free download that added extra content, gameplay challenges, and [[game engine]] improvements. These were incorporated into a 2005 remake, entitled ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', that was regarded by the game's creator as the definitive version. Two years later, the game was [[ported]] to the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) [[game console]] and released as ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''.

==Gameplay==
''Ninja Gaiden'' develops its narrative thread through the actions of its player-controlled protagonist, [[Ryu Hayabusa]]. Viewed from a [[Third-person shooter|third person]] over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering or buying items. In keeping with his [[ninja]] persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or running across water.<ref name="gsngrev">{{cite web

In addition to the narrative Story Mode, subsequent [[Video game remake|remake]]s ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' introduced a gameplay variation called Mission Mode.

</ref> Eric Williams, the designer of the ''God of War'' combat engine, explained that ''Ninja Gaiden'' prohibits players from stopping or changing attacks in mid-stroke. In contrast, ''God of War'' allows players to do so, and ''Devil May Cry'' grants this freedom to certain attacks. Williams said that, compared to those two games, the combat system in ''Ninja Gaiden'' was harder to master; however, it let players fight their computer controlled foes on equal terms.<ref name="mech" />

''Ninja Gaiden'' features a large selection of weapons for Ryu to wield, each with advantages and disadvantages that affect the way the player approaches combat. These include one-handed swords, such as the Dragon Sword and Kitetsu, which grant quick attacks and a move called the "Flying Swallow", that allows Ryu to leap and slash through enemies. In addition these light weapons allow Ryu to smash foes into the ground and perform his signature Izuna Drop&mdash;a spinning [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]]. Heavy weapons, such as the Dabilahro and the Unlabored Flawlessness, are slow but cause more damage to opponents. With [[flail]]s and [[Staff (stick)|staves]], the player can string together long sequences of attacks, and to engage distant foes Ryu can throw [[shuriken]] and shoot arrows.<ref name="gsngrev" /><ref>{{cite web

In addition to using standard melee techniques, Ryu can employ 'essences' in combat. These are colored globes of energy that are released on the death of enemies, and absorbed into Ryu's body when he comes into proximity with them. Essences have an important role in general gameplay, acting to heal Ryu, restore his magic, or increase his cash. However, in combat the player can cause Ryu to deliberately draw in essences, which can then be used to unleash powerful attacks known as Ultimate Techniques.<ref name="denngb" /> These techniques deal heavy damage and make Ryu immune to injury for a short time.<ref name="eurong">{{cite web

''Ninja Gaiden'' also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ''ninpos''. When activated by the player, these make Ryu cast fireballs, ice storms, or bolts of lightning. Functioning in a similar manner to the bombs or grenades of [[Shoot 'em up|shooter action games]], these spells allow Ryu to inflict heavy damage on enemies while potentially avoiding damage himself.<ref name="ignngrev">{{cite web

For Ryu's defense, the player has two options. First, Ryu can stand still and attempt to block attacks. However, certain enemies can break his guard&mdash;either through particularly strong attacks or by [[grappling]] him. The second option is to make Ryu dodge, by rolling away from the attack in a maneuver called "reverse wind".<ref name="denngb" />

Two other characters assist the player in the game. [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Ayane]], a female ninja and one of the ''DOA'' regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout ''Ninja Gaiden'' by supplying advice and objectives to the player.

Ryu's quest for vengeance spans sixteen chapters, each beginning and ending with a cut scene. At the start of the game, the player takes control of Ryu as he infiltrates the Shadow clan fortress. Ryu is there to visit his uncle, the clan leader [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ninjas|Murai]]. During their chat, Ayane delivers news of a raid on the Hayabusa village.

One key feature of the remake is its two new difficulty settings&mdash;the easy 'Ninja Dog', and the very hard 'Master Ninja'.<ref name="denngb" /> Itagaki added Ninja Dog after receiving complaints of ''Ninja Gaiden'' being too hard in its default incarnation,<ref>{{cite news

</ref> Hence he ensured that those players selecting Ninja Dog would be subjected to gentle mockery by the game&mdash;players on this difficulty setting receive pink ribbons as accessories, and Ayane treats Ryu as an inferior. In compensation, Itagaki made the other difficulty settings harder than in ''Ninja Gaiden''. Ryu's adversaries were strengthened and made more aggressive, and some of his offensive moves, such as the Flying Swallow, were toned down.<ref name="denngb" />

Another feature of ''Black'' is its Mission Mode, which comprises 50&nbsp;combat missions, one of which is adapted from the custom game designed for the Ninja Gaiden Master Tournament World Championship final. The last five missions are based on those in ''Hurricane Pack&nbsp;2'', but with the ''Black'' game engine, and form a linked series known as "Eternal Legend".<ref name="ngbpre" />

''Ninja Gaiden'' was released to general critical acclaim.

GameSpot hailed it as having the best visual and audio presentation on the Xbox, and praised its new Mission Mode for "[distilling] the game down to its purest essentials".<ref name="gsngbrev"/> IGN called its release "a rare and welcome day", which "[brought their] excitement levels back to the first time [they] played the game".<ref name="ignngbrev"/>

From a technical point of view, critics regarded ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Black'' as the best of the available Xbox software at the time; the console hardware had been pushed to its limits without showing significant drops in performance. GameSpot was impressed with their "first-rate presentation" and said that no other games at that time came close in visuals and audio.<ref name="gsngbrev" /> According to IGN, the games could "make [them] momentarily forget about the next generation of consoles".<ref name="ignngbrev" /> Both ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Black'' were top-sellers, which led to them being [[backward compatibility|compatible]] with the [[Xbox 360]] for all regions on the new platform's release.<ref>{{cite news

However, critics varied in their views on the technical aspects of ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''. The gaming site, [[1UP.com]], called the updated graphics as "a gorgeous reworking of the modern ninja classic".<ref name="sig1uprev" /> [[Pro-G]], however, said that they were average by next-generation standards and showed occasional "tearing, jagged edges, and miss matched collision between bloodstains and walls".<ref name="prosigrev" /> Various flaws also troubled 1UP&mdash;despite installing the game on the local hard drive, they encountered frequent loading delays, even in combat. They also noted visual glitches, such as [[screen tearing]] when the camera moved. These problems made the game "feel like a bit of a slapdash port".<ref name="sig1uprev" /> Although reviewers appreciated the  retention of the gameplay of previous versions,<ref name="ignau" /><ref name="sig1uprev" /> ''Sigma's'' lack of new attractive features caused them to question its worth as "a remake of a remake". Pro-G said that ''Sigma'' was not worth its full-game price tag because it "has, in effect, been available for years in one form or another".<ref name="prosigrev" /> [[Eurogamer]] stated that ''Sigma'' lacked the "wow factor" when compared to ''God of War'' and [[God of War II|its sequel]].<ref name="eusigrev" /> The 1UP critic felt that shaking the Sixaxis controller to power up a ninpo was "silly" and a "foolishly tacked-on" way to use the controller.<ref name="sig1uprev" /> IGN was not excited about playing as Rachel and wished to "get back to Ryu's sections simply because he's more fun to play".<ref name="ignsigrev" /> DailyGame, however, appreciated the change of pace, saying that Rachel will bring a "much-needed respite for newcomers and provide something new for experienced players".<ref>{{cite web

''Ninja Gaiden'' attracted criticism for the way on-screen action is framed by the game's camera. The default camera system centers the action on Ryu and his surroundings, but reviewers were frustrated by occasions when the camera locked on to part of the scenery, thus losing track of Ryu.<ref name="ignngbrev" /><ref name="trend" /> Tecmo attempted to address this with the introduction of manual camera controls in the ''Hurricane Packs'',<ref name="hurhands1" /><ref name="gsngbrev" />  and most critics judged that either the camera frame was usually acceptable, or that ''Ninja Gaiden'' was a good enough game that its flaws could be overlooked.<ref name="gsngbrev" /><ref name="ignsigrev" />

The ''Ninja Gaiden'' games gained a reputation throughout the gaming community for their difficulty and attention to detail.<ref name="history" /><ref>{{cite journal

</ref> Although they appealed to gamers who, like Pro-G, wanted a "bloody hard, but also bloody good" challenge,<ref name="prongrev" /> it was feared that casual gamers would find the learning curve daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not "get as much out of this game as others due to [its] incredible difficulty".<ref name="ignngbrev" /> Clive Thompson focused on ''Ninja Gaiden'' in his ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article examining the motivation for playing difficult games. He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially very frustrating and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust. However, where a game also rewards a player's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges, that player will have the motivation to finish the game. ''Ninja Gaiden'', in his opinion, strikes the correct balance between challenge and reward; completion brings "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of ''[[War and Peace]]''".<ref>{{cite web
