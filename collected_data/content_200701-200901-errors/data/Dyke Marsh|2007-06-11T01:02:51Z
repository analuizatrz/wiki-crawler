'''Dyke Marsh''' is located on the west bank of the [[Potomac River]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]] between Old Town Alexandria and [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon]]. Dyke Marsh consists of about 380 acres of tidal marsh, [[floodplain]], and swamp forest. Forming 5,000 to 7,000 years ago, Dyke Marsh is the largest remaining piece of freshwater tidal wetlands left in the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]]. The marsh is managed by the [[National Park Service]]. Dyke Marsh contains a wide array of plant and animal life. "Haul Road" is a trail that leads visitors into the marsh. It is frequented by area birdwatchers. Dyke Marsh is located off the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]].

== Name ==
Dyke Marsh got its name because it was within a [[Dike (construction)|dike]] at one point. Earthen walls were built around the perimeter of the marsh in the [[19th century]] to create more "fast land," land not inundated by [[tides]]. This land was used for farming purposes, mainly to graze livestock or to grow crops.

Dyke Marsh has an abundance of wildlife. Evidence of a [[beaver]] population is visible along the "Haul Road" and [[muskrat]] have been spotted numerous times. [[Little brown bat]]s and [[red fox]] can be seen at night. [[Cottontail rabbit]], [[gray squirrel]]s, [[shrews]], and field mice (the [[vole]]) can also be found in and around the marsh. The most obvious habitant of Dyke Marsh is the [[Red-winged Blackbird]], with its distinct call. The Red-winged Blackbird nests among the [[cattails]] and feeds on insects and seeds. Nearly 300 species of birds have been seen in Dyke Marsh. It is known as one of the best [[birdwatching]] sites in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]].

== Plants ==
More than 360 species of plants have been found at Dyke Marsh. The narrow-leafed [[cattail]] is the dominant species in the area. It normally develops its characteristic flower spike by June. Many other species of plant occupy the marsh including several types of [[Sagittaria]], arrow arum, pickerelweed, sweetflag, spatter-pond lily, and [[Northern Wild Rice]]. The rice attracts animals such as the Red-winged Blackbird and [[waterfowl]].

Dyke Marsh is much different than it used to be. It is estimated that the marsh once consisted of 650 acres. In the 1950s and 1960's, [[dredging]] took place, which reduced it to its current size and configuration. Shoreline [[erosion]] is noticeable along the Haul Road, showing that the dredging is still making an impact. Human influences has also led to the introduction of several types of exotic, or non-native, plants to the marsh. These plants are very opportunistic and often outcompete beneficial native species of plants. Exotic vines, such as the Asian procelain-berry, [[Japanese honeysuckle]], and Asiatic bittersweet have begun smothering parts the floodplain forest. Yellow iris and the [[common reed]] are exotic plants that now inhabit the actual marsh. Efforts are being made to prevent the introduction of the [[purple loosestrife]].

== Uses ==
Dyke Marsh is along the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] and the [[Mount Vernon Trail]]. Thousands of bicyclists, walkers, and runners go through Dyke Marsh on a weekly basis on the Mount Vernon Trail. Just off of the trail, there is a sitting area on a boardwalk over the marsh. Birdwatchers, animal lovers, and nature enthusiasts often visit the sitting area in an effort to catch a glimpse of what Dyke Marsh has to offer. Some people like to visit the marsh at night to watch the fireflies as they dance along the marsh and in the trees. Underage drinking has been known to take place at Dyke Marsh at night, due to its remote location.
