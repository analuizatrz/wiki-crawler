{{merge|Mare Nostrum}}

'''Italian Mare Nostrum''' was the name given, during [[World War II]], by [[Benito Mussolini]] and his [[Italian fascism|fascist]] propaganda to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] under the domination of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861â€“1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], mainly in 1942.

==The Mare Nostrum of Mussolini==

The Mediterranean was called ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (Latin for "Our Sea") during the centuries of the [[Roman Empire]], an empire that Fascism intended to recreate after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|conquest of Ethiopia]] in [[1936]].  The phrase was first revived by the Italian poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and then appropriated for propaganda purposes by Mussolini.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mussolini: A New Life |last=Farrell |pages=p.&nbsp;87 }}</ref>

Mussolini wanted to re-establish the greatness of the Roman Empire and believed that Italy was the most powerful of the Mediterranean countries after [[World War I]]. He declared that "the [[20th century|twentieth century]] will be a century of Italian power" and created a formidable navy in order to control the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>Fleming, Thomas.

However, the nation that really dominated the Mediterranean in [[1940]] was the [[United Kingdom]], as the British had strong naval bases in [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]]. The British also controlled the [[Suez Canal]], along with the French; [[French Third Republic|France]] had a relatively powerful navy, and controlled the African [[Maghreb]]. Only after the German conquest of [[Greece]] and [[Yugoslavia]], in April 1941, did Mussolini start to talk about an Italian dominated Mediterranean sea.

In 1942 Mussolini dreamed to create a [[Greater Italy]] in his "Mare Nostrum" and promoted the fascist project -to be realized in a future peace conference after the expected [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] victory- of an enlarged [[Italian Empire]], stretching from the Mediterranean shores of [[Egypt]] to the Indian Ocean shores of [[Somalia]] and eastern [[Kenya]]. All these projects disappeared with the final Italian defeat of September [[1943]].
