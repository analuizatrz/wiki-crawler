'''Madeira''' ([[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] [{{IPA|mɐ'deiɾɐ}}] or [{{IPA|mɐ'dɐiɾɐ}}]) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[archipelago]] in the north [[Atlantic Ocean]] that lies between {{coor dm|32|22.3|N|16|16.5|W}} and {{coor dm|33|7.8|N|17|16.65|W}}. It is one of the [[Autonomous regions of Portugal]], with '''Madeira Island''' and [[Porto Santo]] being the only inhabited [[islands]]. It belongs politically and culturaly to [[Europe]], even if it can be considered to be a geographical part of the [[African Plate]].

Madeira, known originally to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as the ''Purple Islands'', was rediscovered, possibly accidentally, by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors and settled by [[Portugal]] as early as 1418 or as late as 1420.  The archipelago is considered to be the first discovery of the exploratory period initiated by [[Henry the Navigator]] of Portugal. It is a popular year-round [[resort]], famed worldwide for its [[Madeira wine]], a perfect climate, striking scenery, flowers, embroidery artisans, and New Year's Eve celebrations with a spectacular [[fireworks show]], recently considered the biggest [[fireworks show]] in the [[world]], by the [[Guinness World Records]].

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Botanical_garden_madeira_hg.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Botanic Garden in [[Funchal]]]]
The Autonomous Region of Madeira is composed of Madeira Island, [[Porto Santo]] Island, [[Desertas Islands]] and [[Savage Islands]].

[[Funchal]], the capital of Madeira Island, is on the south coast of the principal island, in {{coor dm|32|37.75|N|16|55.3|W}}. Other main cities are: [[Porto Santo]] Town also known as [[Vila Baleira]], [[Ribeira Brava]], [[Machico]], [[Câmara de Lobos]], [[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]] and [[Santana]].

The archipelago lies about 360.0 miles from the coast of Africa, 535 miles from [[Lisbon]], 230 from [[Gran Canaria]], and 480 from Santa Maria, the nearest of the [[Azores]].

Madeira Island is the largest island of the group with 741 km², has a length of 30 geographical miles (57 km), an extreme breadth of 13 miles (22 km), and a coastline of 80 or 90 miles. Its longer axis lies east and west, in which direction it is traversed by a mountain chain, the backbone of the island, having a mean altitude of 4000 feet (1220 metres), from which many deep ravines radiate outward to the coast. The highest point on the island is [[Pico Ruivo]], at 1862 meters (6107 feet)[http://www.madeirahelp.com/madeira_geography].

On the south there is very little left of the indigenous ''[[laurisilva]]'' forest which once clothed the whole island (until the original settlers decided to clear the land for farming by setting most of the island on fire) and gave it the name it bears (''Madeira'' means "wood" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), but on the north the valleys contain native trees of fine growth. These ''laurisilva'' forests, notably the forests on the northern slopes of Madeira Island, are designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

A long narrow and comparatively low rocky promontory forms the eastern extremity of the island, and here there is to be seen a tract of calcareous sand, known as the Fossil Bed, containing land shells and numerous bodies resembling the roots of trees, probably produced by infiltration.

Its geographical position and mountainous landscape permit a very pleasing climate. Temperatures are about 22 °C (72 °F) in the summer and about 16 °C (61 °F) during the winter [http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=012580&refer=&units=metric]. With its mild humidity, the weather of the island is classified as subtropical. Influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]], sea water temperature is 22 °C during the summer and 16 °C in the winter.

==Geologic origin and volcanism==

Madeira Island is the top of a massive [[shield volcano]] that rises about 6 km from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.  The volcano formed atop an east-west [[rift]] in the [[oceanic crust]].  Construction of the bulk of the volcano began during the [[Miocene]] Epoch over 5 million years ago and continued into the [[Pleistocene]] until about 700,000 years ago.  This was followed by extensive [[erosion]], producing two large amphitheaters open to south in the central part of the island.  Volcanic activity later resumed, producing [[scoria cone]]s and [[lava flow]]s atop the older eroded shield.  The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island only 6,500 years ago, creating more [[cinder cone]]s and lava flows.

==Municipalities==
[[Image:Funchal from Jardim Botanico.JPG|left|thumb|[[Funchal]].]]
[[Image:Funchal.jpg|left|thumb|Funchal by night]] 

Just like the districts of mainland Portugal, Madeira is also further subdivided into 11 [[município|municipalities]]:

*[[Calheta, Madeira|Calheta]]
*[[Câmara de Lobos]]
*[[Funchal]]
*[[Machico]]
*[[Ponta do Sol]]
*[[Porto Moniz]]
*[[Porto Santo]]
*[[Ribeira Brava, Madeira|Ribeira Brava]]
*[[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]]
*[[Santana, Madeira|Santana]]
*[[São Vicente, Madeira|São Vicente]]

===Capital city===
Today [[Funchal]] is a modern city with about 140,000 inhabitants. [[Funchal]] is located in a unique area; the natural geological features form an "[[amphitheatre]]" surrounding the city, which begins at the harbour and rises almost 1200 metres high on gentle slopes.  This provides a natural shelter and was what attracted the first settlers.

Madeira's [[capital]] for more than five centuries, Funchal is said to have been named as such because of the abundance of [[fennel]] (''funcho'' - in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) that was growing there.

The harbour and [[climate]] combined with an excellent geographical position allowed Funchal to have a rapid population growth.

Probably the most central point is the Sé [[Cathedral]]. Built between [[1493]] and [[1514]] by [[Pêro Annes]] in [[Manueline]] style it represents one of Madeira's numerous treasures.

The islands are noted as the source of [[Madeira wine]]. The islands are also known for its flowers, sub-tropical fruits and New Year's Eve celebrations with a spectacular [[fireworks show]], considered the biggest in the world.

Traditional pastries in Madeira usually contain local ingredients, one of the most common being ''mel de cana'', literally ''sugarcane honey'' - molasses. The traditional cake of Madeira is called 'Bolo de mel', which translates as (Sugarcane)'Honey Cake' and according to custom is never cut with a knife but broken into pieces by hand. It is a rich and heavy cake. Visitors to the island will see plentiful examples of handicraft on sale in shops.

There are around 250,000 inhabitants (1991) in the two main islands, while only 4,800 live on Porto Santo Island. The population density is 337 inhabitants per square kilometre in Madeira and 112 in Porto Santo. Most of the early settlers were from the Portuguese regions of the [[Algarve]] and [[Minho]]. The islands have historical monuments, streets and plazas (''praças'') with many gardens and typical small towns.

==Biodiversity==
Madeira has three [[endemism in birds|endemic]] birds: [[Zino's Petrel]], [[Trocaz pigeon]] and [[Madeira Firecrest]]. 

It is also of importance for other breeding [[seabird]]s, including [[Madeiran Storm-petrel]], [[North Atlantic Little Shearwater]] and [[Cory's Shearwater]].

The [[Macaronesia]] region harbours an important floral diversity. In fact, their forests composition and antiquity are quite similar to the one found in the [[Tertiary period]] that has covered the [[Southern Europe]] and [[Northern Africa]] millions of years ago.

The great [[biodiversity]] of Madeira is phytogeographically linked to [[Mediterranean]] region, [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Australia]], and its phytogeographical interest has been increasing in recent years due to the discovery of some bryophyte epiphytic species with disjunctive distribution.

==History==
It has been conjectured, but on insufficient evidence, that the [[Phoenicia]]ns discovered Madeira at a very early period.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentions certain Purple Islands, the position of which with reference to the Fortunate Islands or [[Canary Islands|Canaries]] might seem to indicate Madeira islands. Plutarch (''Sertorius'', 75 AD) referring to the military commander [[Quintus Sertorius]] (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to [[Cadiz]], "he met seamen recently arrived from Atlantic islands, two in number, divided from one another only by a narrow channel and distant from the coast of Africa 10,000 furlongs. They are called Isles of the Blest." The estimated distance from Africa, and the closeness of the two islands, seem to indicate Madeira and Porto Santo.

There is a romantic tale about two lovers, [[Robert Machim]] and [[Anna d'Arfet]] in time of the King [[Edward III of England]], fleeing from [[England]] to [[France]] in [[1346]], were driven off their course by a violent storm, and cast on the coast of Madeira at the place subsequently named [[Machico]], in memory of one of them. On the evidence of a [[portolan]] dated [[1351]], preserved at [[Florence, Italy]], it would appear that Madeira had been discovered long before that date by Portuguese vessels under [[Genoa|Genoese]] captains.

In 1419 two of the captains of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] and [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]], were driven by a storm to the island called by them Porto Santo, or Holy Port, in gratitude for their rescue from shipwreck. The next year an expedition was sent to populate the island, and, Madeira being described, they made for it, and took possession on behalf of the Portuguese crown.

The islands started to be settled circa 1432 or 1433. In [[September 23]], [[1433]], the name ''Ilha da Madeira'' (Madeira Island or "island of the [[wood]]") appears in a map, by the first time, in a document.

The three captain-donees had led, in the first trip, the respective families, a small group of people of the minor [[nobility]], people of modest conditions and some old prisoners of the kingdom. To gain the minimum conditions for the development of [[agriculture]], they had to rough-hew a part of the dense forest of [[laurisilva]] and to construct a large number of canals ([[levada]]s), since in some parts of the island, they had water in excess while in other parts water was scarce. In the earliest times, [[fish]] constituted about half of the settlers' diet, together with vegetables and fruit. The first local agricultural activity with some success was the raising of [[wheat]]. Initially, the colonists produced wheat for their own sustenance but, later began to export wheat to Portugal. 

However, in time grain production began to fall. To get past the ensuing crisis [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]] decided to order the planting of [[Sugarcane]] - rare in [[Europe]] and, therefore, considered a [[spice]] - promoting, for this, the introduction of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] beets as the first specialized plant and the technology of its agriculture. Sugar production attracted to the island Jewish, Genoese and Portuguese traders. Sugarcane productino was a leading factor in the island's economy. Sugar production grew to the extent that demand for labor increased. Sugarcane cultivation and the sugar production industry would develop until the [[17th century]]. 

Following the 17th century Madeira's most important product has been its [[wine]], sugar production having since moved on to [[Brazil]], [[São Tomé and Principe]], and elsewhere. Madeira wine was perhaps the most popular luxury beverage in the colonial Western Hemisphere during the 17th and 18th centuries.

In 1921, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] was deported to Madeira, after an unsuccessful [[coup d'état]]. He died there one year later.

In [[July 1]] [[1976]], following the [[Carnation revolution|democratic revolution]] of 1974, Portugal granted political autonomy to Madeira. The region has now its own government and legislative assembly.

[[Image:Flughafen Madeira 1.jpg|thumb|International airport of Madeira]]
The setting-up of the [[Free Industrial Zone]] has led to the installation, under more favourable conditions, of infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized [[industrial enterprises]]. The Free Zone of Madeira, also called the Madeira International Business Centre, being a tax-privileged economic area, provides an incentive for companies, offering them financial and tax advantages via a whole range of activities exercised in the Industrial Free Zone, the Off-Shore Financial Centre, the International Shipping Register organisation, and the International Service Centre. 

The services sector makes the largest contribution to the formation of the regional gross value added as opposed to the [[agricultural sector]], for which the share has continuously declined in the regional economy.

Over the last few years, the regional economy has managed to open up and establish more internal and external competitiveness, so that its companies have become internationalised.

The largest industries are associated with the activities of food, [[beverages]] (and especially [[Madeira wine]]) and [[construction]].

===Tourism, one of the main activities===

[[Tourism]] is an important sector in the region's economy since it contributes 20% to the region's [[GDP]], providing support throughout the year for [[commerce|commercial]], [[transport]] and other activities and constituting a significant market for local products. The share in Gross Value Added of hotels and [[restaurants]] (9%) also highlights this phenomenon. The island of [[Porto Santo]], with its 9 km long beach and its climate, is totally devoted to tourism. Over the past decade it has recorded a substantial increase in its hotel accommodation capacity. The Madeira has considerable [[potential]] since the necessary infrastructure has been established and adequate investment incentives introduced for expanding its hotel and catering structure in a controlled manner, without disturbing the socio-economic and environmental balance, and without neglecting the conservation of its nature, which is one of tourists' main reasons for visiting Madeira.

Visitors are from the [[European Union]], with [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Scandinavia]] and  [[Portugal|Portuguese]] tourists providing the main contingents. The average annual occupancy rate was 57.4% in 2001, reaching its maximum in March and April, when it exceeds 70%.

==Levadas==
{{main|Levada}}
The island of Madeira is wet in the northwest but dry in the southeast. In the 16th century the Portuguese started building levadas to carry water to the agricultural regions. The most recent was made in the 1940s. Madeira is very mountainous, and building the levadas was often difficult. Many are cut into the sides of mountains, and it was also necessary to dig 25 miles of tunnels. [1]

Today the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island but provide [[hydro-electric power]]. There are over 1350 miles of levadas and they provide a remarkable network of walking paths. Some provide easy and relaxing walks through beautiful countryside, but others are narrow, crumbling ledges where a slip could result in serious injury or death.

Two of the most popular levadas to hike are the ''Levada do Caldeiro Verde'' and the ''Levada Caldeirão do Inferno'' which should not be attempted by hikers prone to vertigo or without torches and helmets. The ''Levada do Caniçal'' is a much easier walk, running 7.1 miles from [[Maroços]] to the ''Caniçal Tunnel''. It is known as the ''mimosa levada'' because [[Mimosa|mimosa trees]] are found all along the route.

==Sport==
[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] was born in [[Funchal]], Madeira.

Madeira also has two football teams called [[C.S. Marítimo]], being the biggest one, and [[C.D. Nacional]] where [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] signed after [[C.S. Marítimo]] missed a crucial meeting with Rui Santos manager of Andorinha where he first played. Maritimo has also revealed other great players such as Pepe, now at [[FC Porto]], Tonel now at [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] and Manduca who was transferred to [[Benfica]]. Maritimo has also enjoyed various campaigns in the UEFA cup having played teams such as [[Juventus]] and [[Leeds United|Leeds]].

==Transport==

The Islands have two airports, one in [[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]] (known as [[Funchal Airport]] (FNC)) on the Island of Madeira and the other in the city of [[Vila Baleira]] on [[Porto Santo Island]]. Flights to the islands are mostly made from [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]], but there are also direct flights from other major European cities and other countries, like [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[South Africa]]. Funchal airport was infamous for its runway built on a high embankment, falling away abruptly to the sea and with difficult upwinds causing to uplift the aircraft when landing. It was a short runway, but now has been extended to support [[Boeing 747-400]] (one of the biggest airliners today). The largest airliners to use the airport were the [[Airbus A320]] and [[Boeing 737]]. Recently the runway has been realigned and extended to 2.7km, allowing almost any modern airliner to visit the island.  [[European Union]] citizens of the [[Schengen Treaty]] area can enter the islands freely, while those from other regions need identification. 

Transport between the two main islands is done by plane or by ferries which allow for the transportation of vehicles. Visiting the interior of these islands is now very easy, due to large developments on the islands during Portugal's economic boom. There are modern roads, reaching all points of interest on the islands and there is also a good transportation network.

==Postage stamps==
In 1868, Portugal issued [[postage stamp]]s for Madeira, consisting of the current stamps of Portugal [[overprint]]ed "MADEIRA". This continued until 1928, when a series for Madeira was issued; but this was the last to be produced until 1980 (stamps of Portugal having been valid in Madeira since 1898), when Portugal began issuing stamps inscribed "Portugal Madeira" that were valid in both Madeira and Continental Portugal, similar to those issued for the [[Azores]].
