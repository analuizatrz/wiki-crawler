'''''Banksia epica''''' is a [[shrub]] that grows on the south coast of [[Western Australia]]. A spreading bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½&nbsp;metres (11½&nbsp;ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations in the remote south east of the [[States and territories of Australia|state]], near the western edge of the [[Great Australian Bight]]. Both populations occur amongst coastal [[heath (habitat)|heath]] on [[cliff-top dune]]s of [[Silicon dioxide|siliceous]] sand.

One of the most recently described ''[[Banksia]]'' species, it was probably seen by [[Edward John Eyre]] in 1841, but was not collected until 1973, and was only recognised as a distinct [[species]] in 1988. There has been very little research on the species since  then, so knowledge of its ecology and cultivation potential is limited. It is placed in [[Banksia ser. Cyrtostylis|''Banksia'' ser. ''Cyrtostylis'']], alongside its close relative, the well-known and widely cultivated ''[[Banksia media|B.&nbsp;media]]'' (Southern Plains Banksia).

==Description==
''B.&nbsp;epica'' grows as a spreading bushy shrub with many branches, from 30&nbsp;centimetres to 3½&nbsp;metres (1–11½&nbsp;ft) tall.  It has grey, fissured bark, and dark green, wedge-shaped leaves, 1½ to 5&nbsp;centimetres (½–2&nbsp;in) long and 6 to 15&nbsp;millimetres ({{frac|1|8}}–{{frac|2|3}}&nbsp;in) wide, with serrated [[Leaf#margins (edge)|margins]].

[[Image:B epica 06 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|right|Inflorescence in early bud]]
Flowers occur in ''Banksia''<span/>'s characteristic "flower spike", an [[inflorescence]] made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a [[helix|spiral]] round a woody axis. ''B.&nbsp;epica''<span/>'s flower spike is yellow or cream-yellow in colour, cylindrical, 9 to 17&nbsp;centimetres (3½–6½&nbsp;inches) tall and around 6&nbsp;centimetres (2½&nbsp;inches) in diameter. In bud, it may have green-grey or brownish [[pollen presenter]]s, not unlike ''[[Banksia robur|B.&nbsp;robur]]'' (Swamp Banksia).<ref name = "Collins 2002">{{cite journal | author = Collins, Kevin | year = 2002 | title = ''Banksia'' in horticulture | journal = Australian Plants | volume = 21 | issue = 173 | pages = 379–383 | publisher = [[ASGAP]] | id=ISSN 0005-0008}}</ref> Each flower consists of a tubular [[perianth]] made up of four fused [[tepal]]s, and one long wiry [[carpel|style]]. Characteristic of its taxonomic section, the styles of ''B.&nbsp;epica'' are straight rather than hooked. The style ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at [[anthesis]]. The fruiting structure is a stout woody "cone" embedded with up to 50 [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]]; old withered flower parts persist on the "cones", giving them a hairy appearance.<ref name="George 1999">{{cite encyclopedia | author = [[Alex George|George, Alex S.]] | year = 1999 | title = ''Banksia'' | editor = Wilson, Annette | encyclopedia = [[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]] | volume = Volume 17B: Proteaceae 3: Hakea to Dryandra | pages = 175–251 | publisher = [[CSIRO Publishing]] / [[Australian Biological Resources Study]] | id = ISBN 0-643-06454-0}}</ref> The follicles have an attractive purple hue.

''B.&nbsp;epica'' is similar in appearance to its close relative ''B.&nbsp;media'', from which it differs in having slightly shorter leaves and larger flowers.  In addition, the persistent flower parts on ''B.&nbsp;epica''<span/>'s fruiting structures are curled and point upwards, whereas they are straight and point downwards on ''B.&nbsp;media''.<ref name="Taylor 1988">{{The Banksia Atlas}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
{{seealso|Taxonomy of Banksia}}
===Discovery and naming===
The first European to see ''B.&nbsp;epica'' was probably [[Edward John Eyre]],<ref name="George 1988">{{cite journal | author = [[Alex George|George, Alex S.]] | year = 1988 | title = New taxa and notes on ''Banksia'' L.f. (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Nuytsia (journal)|Nuytsia]] | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–317}}</ref> the first explorer of the area, who recorded "stunted specimens" of ''Banksia'' as he was nearing the western edge of the Great Australian Bight on [[1 May]] [[1841]]:
{{quote|"One circumstance in our route to-day cheered me greatly, and led me shortly to expect some important and decisive change in the character and formation of the country. It was the appearance for the first time of the Banksia, a shrub which I had never before found to the westward of [[Spencer Gulf|Spencer's Gulf]], but which I knew to abound in the vicinity of [[King George Sound|King George's Sound]], and that description of country generally. Those only who have looked out with the eagerness and anxiety of a person in my situation, to note any change in the vegetation or physical appearance of a country, can appreciate the degree of satisfaction with which I recognised and welcomed the first appearance of the Banksia. Isolated as it was amidst the scrub, and insignificant as the stunted specimens were that I first met with, they led to an inference that I could not be mistaken in, and added, in a tenfold degree, to the interest and expectation with which every mile of our route had now become invested."<ref name="Eyre 1845">{{cite book | author = [[Edward John Eyre|Eyre, Edward John]] | year = 1845 | title = [[Journals of Expeditions of Discovery into Central Australia]] | location = London | publisher = T. and W. Boone}}</ref>}}
Eyre is thought to have been passing through the [[Toolinna Cove]] sand patch at the time of writing.<ref name="Nelson 1974">{{cite journal | author = [[Ernest Charles Nelson|E. Charles Nelson]] | year = 1974 | title = Disjunct plant distributions on the south-western Nullarbor Plain, Western Australia | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia]] | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 105–117}}</ref> ''B.&nbsp;epica'' and ''B.&nbsp;media'' are the only ''Banksia'' species that occur at that location,<ref name="George 1999"/> and both have a form and habit that accords with Eyre's description. As he did not collect specimens, it is impossible to determine what species he saw.

The first herbarium collection of ''B.&nbsp;epica'' was not made until October 1973, when [[Ernest Charles Nelson]] visited Toolinna Cove to collect specimens for a taxonomic revision of ''[[Adenanthos]]''. He became interested in the disjunct plant distributions there, and ended up collecting specimens of a range of plant species.<ref name="Nelson 1974"/> On 22 October, he collected a specimen of ''B.&nbsp;epica'' in old flower, but incorrectly identified it as ''B.&nbsp;media'', and later lodged it in the [[herbarium]] at [[Canberra]] under that name.<ref name="George 1988"/>

In 1985, two volunteer field collectors for ''[[The Banksia Atlas]]'' project, John and Lalage Falconer of [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]], became convinced that there were three ''Banksia'' species rather than two at [[Point Culver]]. Returning to the locality on [[9 January]] [[1986]], they collected leaves and old flowers of what they thought was an undescribed species. The specimens did indeed suggest that a new species had been discovered, but they were not sufficient for formal publication.  Early in May the following year, John Falconer drove over 2000 kilometres on unsealed tracks from [[Warburton, Western Australia|Warburton]] to Point Culver and back again, in order to collect fresh flowers and fruit of the purported new species.<ref name="Taylor 1988"/> [[Alex George]] then began preparing a formal description of the species. During his research, he discovered that Nelson's Toolinna Cove specimen was also referrable to the undescribed species. In the absence of any genuine ''B.&nbsp;media'' specimens from Toolinna Cova, George inferred that only ''B.&nbsp;epica'' occurred there, and that Eyre must have sighted ''B.&nbsp;epica'' in 1841. In 1988, he published a formal description of the species, naming it ''Banksia epica'' in reference to the two "epic" journeys of Eyre and Falconer.<ref name="George 1988"/> Thus the species' full name is ''Banksia epica'' A.S.George.<ref name="APNI">{{APNI | name = ''Banksia epica'' A.S.George | id = 53463}}</ref> It was later established that both ''B.&nbsp;epica'' and ''B.&nbsp;media'' occur at Toolinna Cove.<ref name="George 1999"/>

===Infrageneric placement===
George placed ''B.&nbsp;epica'' in [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']], because its inflorescences are typical ''Banksia'' flower spikes; [[Banksia sect. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;sect. ''Banksia'']] because of its straight [[style]]s; and [[Banksia ser. Cyrtostylis|''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Cyrtostylis'']] because it has slender flowers. He considered its closest relatives to be ''[[Banksia praemorsa|B.&nbsp;praemorsa]]'' (Cut-leaf Banksia) and ''B.&nbsp;media'', both of which have shorter flowers and smaller pollen-presenters than ''B.&nbsp;epica''. In addition, ''B.&nbsp;praemorsa'' differs in having a hairless perianth, and ''B.&nbsp;media'' has larger, more undulate leaves.<ref name="George 1988"/>

In 1996, [[Kevin Thiele]] and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters of ''Banksia''. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's ''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Cyrtostylis'' was found to be "widely [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]]", as six of the fourteen taxa in that series occurred singly in locations throughout Thiele and Ladiges' [[cladogram]]. The remaining eight formed a [[clade]] that further resolved into two subclades, with ''B.&nbsp;epica'' appeared in the first of them:<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | author = Thiele, Kevin and Pauline Y.

Thiele and Ladiges preferred to give series rank to the subclades, rather than the entire clade, so they transferred the taxa of the second clade into [[Banksia ser. Ochraceae|''B.''&nbsp;ser.

Since 1998, [[Austin Mast]] has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for the subtribe [[Banksiinae]]. His analyses suggest a [[phylogeny]] that is rather different to previous taxonomic arrangements. With respect to ''B.&nbsp;epica'', however, Mast's results accord closely with the arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges, placing it in a [[polytomous]] clade corresponding exactly with Thiele and Ladiges' ''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Cyrtostylis''.<ref name="Mast 1998">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R. | year = 1998 | title = Molecular systematics of subtribe Banksiinae (''Banksia'' and ''Dryandra''; Proteaceae) based on cpDNA and nrDNA sequence data: implications for taxonomy and biogeography | journal = Australian Systematic Botany | volume = 11 | pages = 321–342 | doi = 10.1071/SB97026}}</ref><ref name="Mast 2002">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R. and Thomas J.

Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring ''Dryandra'' to ''Banksia'', and publishing ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Spathulatae'' for the species having spoon-shaped [[cotyledon]]s; in this way they also redefined the [[autonym]] [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']]. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of ''Dryandra'' was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then ''B.&nbsp;epica'' is placed in ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia''.<ref name="Mast 2007">{{cite journal | author = [[Austin Mast|Mast, Austin R.]] and [[Kevin Thiele]] | year = 2007 | title = The transfer of ''Dryandra'' R.Br. to ''Banksia'' L.f.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:B epica dist map gnangarra.png|thumb|left|Distribution]]
''B.&nbsp;epica'' is known only from two populations in eastern parts of the [[Esperance Plains]] region of the [[South West Botanical Province]], near the western edge of the Great Australian Bight. The main population occurs about 30 kilometres (20&nbsp;mi) west of Point Culver; there were over 2000 plants there when surveyed in June 1989. A smaller population occurs about 70 kilometres (45&nbsp;mi) further east at Toolinna Cove; when surveyed in August 1991, this locality had around 350 plants. This latter population represents the easternmost limit of the western ''Banksia'' species; east of Toolinna Cove no ''Banksia'' species occurs for over 900 kilometres (550&nbsp;mi).

In both localities, ''B.&nbsp;epica'' occurs amongst [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] on [[cliff-top dune]]s of deep, white [[silica|siliceous]] [[sand]] over [[limestone]]. It co-occurs with ''B.&nbsp;media'' in both localities, and ''B.&nbsp;praemorsa'' is also present at Point Culver. Toolinna Cove sand is somewhat [[alkaline]], making ''B.&nbsp;epica'' and ''B.&nbsp;media'' the only ''Banksia'' species that grow in alkaline soil.<ref name="Lamont 1996">{{cite journal | author = [[Byron Lamont|Lamont, Byron B.]] and S. W. Connell | year = 1996 | title = Biogeography of ''Banksia'' in southwestern Australia | journal = [[Journal of Biogeography]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 295–309 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1996.00027.x}}</ref>

These two localities are unusual in having cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand: cliff-top dunes are an unusual [[topography|topographic]] formation, and nearly all soil in the area is [[calcareous]]. As ''Banksia'' species are intolerant of calcareous soils, and are not adapted to long range [[biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], the two populations of ''B.&nbsp;epica'' appear to be reproductively isolated. Nelson has suggested that there was once a continuous strip of siliceous sand along the coast, providing an extensive and unfragmented habitat for ''B.&nbsp;epica''; [[sea level rise|rises]] in the [[sea level]] had submerged this strip, leaving only the cliff-top dunes as suitable habitat. The fact that the resultant isolated populations have not perceptibly [[speciation|speciated]] since then suggests that the species has been fragmented for only a short time, perhaps only since the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name="Nelson 1974"/>

==Ecology==
[[Image:Banksia epica purp foll email.jpg|thumb|right|Old cone with purple follicles]]
{{see also|Ecology of Banksia}}
[[Pollinator]]s of ''B.&nbsp;epica'' include the [[New Holland Honeyeater]] and the [[Yellow-rumped Thornbill]].<ref name="Craig 2001">{{cite book | author = Gillian F. Craig and Coates, David J. | year = 2001 | title = Declared Rare and Poorly Known Flora in the Esperance District | chapter = B.

For example, a survey of the closely related and co-occurring ''B.&nbsp;media'' found that "honeyeater birds and marsupial nectarivores were abundant in the study area and most carried the pollen of ''Banksia media'' while it flowered.… Self-pollination and pollination by insects clearly also play major roles in seed production."<ref name="Wooler 2002">{{cite journal | author = Wooller, S. J. and R. D. Wooller | year = 2002 | title = Mixed mating in ''Banksia media'' | journal = [[Australian Journal of Botany]] | volume = 50 | pages = 627–631 | doi = 10.1071/BT01075}}</ref> 

Like most other [[Proteaceae]], ''B.&nbsp;epica'' has [[proteoid root]]s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance [[solubility|solubilisation]] of [[nutrient]]s, allowing nutrient [[mineral uptake|uptake]] in low-nutrient soils such as the [[phosphorus]]-deficient native soils of [[Australia]]. The species lacks a [[lignotuber]], so is thought to be killed by fire. Like most ''Banksia'' species, however, it is adapted to release its aerial bank of seeds following a bushfire, so populations regenerate rapidly. It is highly susceptible to ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' dieback.<ref name="DEH">{{cite web | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/p-cinnamomi/pubs/appendix4.pdf | title = Part 2, Appendix 4: The responses of native Australian plant species to ''Phytophthora cinnamomi'' | work = [http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/p-cinnamomi/ Management of Phytophthora cinnamomi for Biodiversity Conservation in Australia] | publisher = [[Department of the Environment and Heritage]], Australian Government | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-30}}</ref>

Because so few populations are known, ''B.&nbsp;epica'' has been declared "Priority Two - Poorly Known Taxa" under the [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Environment and Conservation]]'s [[Conservation Codes for Western Australian Flora]]; and as 2RC under the [[ROTAP]] system (rare but not currently endangered or vulnerable, and having a range less than 100 km). It is not considered to be under threat, however, because both known populations occur within the [[Nuytsland Nature Reserve]], and are undisturbed and healthy.<ref name="Craig 2001"/> Furthermore, the area in which it occurs is poorly surveyed, so it is possible that other populations exist.<ref name="Taylor 1988"/>

==Cultivation==
''B.&nbsp;epica'' is fairly new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in [[Albany, Western Australia]] is said to have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in loamy clay or sandy gravel. It showed good tolerance for alkaline soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded in sandy, alkaline soil near the coast between [[Mandurah, Western Australia|Mandurah]] and [[Kwinana, Western Australia|Kwinana]].<ref name = "Collins 2002"/> The [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.<ref name="ASGAP">{{cite web | title = ''Banksia epica'' | publisher = [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants]] (ASGAP) | url = http://farrer.csu.edu.au/ASGAP/b-epi.html | accessdate = 2006-08-30}}</ref><ref name="Liber 2002">{{cite journal | author = Liber, C. | year = 2002 | title = ''Banksia epica'', ''media'' & ''praemorsa'' in ANBG, Canberra | journal = Banksia Study Group Newsletter | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | publisher = [[ASGAP]] | id=ISSN 1444-285X | url = http://farrer.csu.edu.au/ASGAP/banksSG/banksiasg-4-1.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-12-15}}</ref>

In the absence of further information specific to ''B.&nbsp;epica'', George recommends that cultivated plants be treated as for ''B.&nbsp;media'' and ''B.&nbsp;praemorsa'', both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light pruning not below the green foliage.<ref name="George 1987">{{The Banksia Book}}</ref> Propagation is by seed or cuttings.<ref name="ASGAP"/>
