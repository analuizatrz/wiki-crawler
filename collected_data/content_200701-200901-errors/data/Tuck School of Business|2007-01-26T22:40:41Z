The '''Amos Tuck School of Business Administration''' was founded in [[1900]] at [[Dartmouth College]], in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]] and is the oldest ''graduate'' school of business in the world.

Tuck offers only one degree program, the [[Master of Business Administration]], alongside shorter programs for executives and recent college graduates. It co-operates with a Master of Engineering Management offered by Dartmouth's [[Thayer School of Engineering]] and also offers a number of dual degrees, including a joint MD/MBA in conjunction with the [[Dartmouth Medical School]], an MSEL/MBA with the [[Vermont Law School]] and a MALD/MBA with [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]].

The school was established by [[Edward Tuck]], and was originally named the [[Amos Tuck]] School of Administration and Finance (in memory of his father). In [[1941]], the official name was changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration.

Tuck initially donated $300,000 in the form of 1,700 [[shares]] of [[preferred stock]] in the [[Great Northern Railway Company of Minnesota]]. He later gave $100,000 to build the first Tuck Hall (now [[McNutt Hall]]) in [[1901]], and over $500,000 for the current Tuck Hall complex in [[1929]].

==Ranking and reputation==

Tuck has consistently been ranked among the top ten business schools in the world by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', and the ''[[Financial Times]]''.

Many leading business schools in other countries have exchange programs with Tuck, including the [[Handelshochschule Leipzig (HHL)]], the [[HEC School of Management]], [[IESE]] and [[London Business School]].
