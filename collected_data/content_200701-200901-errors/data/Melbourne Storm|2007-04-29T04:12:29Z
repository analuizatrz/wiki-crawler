The '''Melbourne Storm''' are a [[rugby league]] team based in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] that competes in the [[National Rugby League]] premiership. The club is owned by [[News Limited]], part of [[News Corporation]], which also owns the [[Herald Sun]], Melbourne's most popular newspaper. The chief executive, Brian Waldron, hopes that this ownership will be rescinded at some point in the future and the city of Melbourne will take up ownership of the football club.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==History==
The club was created originally as an expansion club to play in the 1998 [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] season before the [[Australian Rugby League]] (ARL) and Super League competitions merged at the conclusion of their respective 1997 seasons to form the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL). Former Chief executive of the [[Brisbane Broncos]] then Super League, [[John Ribot]] was appoiinted the club's first CEO.

During the club's first year in 1998, they exceeded expectations by winning their first four games and finishing third on the ladder. They then advanced to the finals losing to the [[Brisbane Broncos]] two games away from the Grand Final. 

The following season, the Storm built on their initial success and made it to the [[National_Rugby_League_season_1999#Grand_Final|grand final]], defeating the newly formed [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] 20-18 to become the quickest non-foundation club ever to win the premiership after their admission to the league.

==Club facts==

*Melbourne Storm is the first professional rugby league football club based in Melbourne.

*The bulk of the foundation players were largely made up of players from [[Western Reds|Perth Reds]] and [[Hunter Mariners]], clubs made defunct as part of the ARL/Super League merger.

*In 1995 the ARL gave the green light to set up a Melbourne-based rugby league team to start in the 1998 competition but the onset of the Super League war that year saw the plan shelved until Super League picked up the baton and set one up in 1997 to join their 1998 competition.

*In the club's 100th game, they celebrated by defeating the hapless [[Wests Tigers]] 64-0 at [[Colonial Stadium]] on July 5, 2001.

*The Storm marked their 200th game in the NRL with a defeat of the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] 33-6 at the [[Sydney Showground]] on July 2, 2005

*The club only missed the finals while under coach [[Mark Murray

*On April 2 2005, the Melbourne Storm and the Melbourne [[Olympic_Park%2C_Melbourne|Olympic Park]] Trust, administrators of the Olympic Park sports complex, renamed the Western and Eastern Grandstands of [[Olympic Park Stadium]] the [[Glenn Lazarus]] and [[Tawera Nikau]] stands respectively, after the inaugural captain and vice captain of the club in a ceremony before hosting a game against the Brisbane Broncos.

*In the 2006 Telstra NRL Premiership the Melbourne Storm won their first minor premiership, winning 20 games, and finishing the season on 44 points, a record for the NRL. The Storm subsequently lost the Grand Final 15-8 to the Brisbane Broncos, to finish runners-up.

==Season 2006==
Between rounds 13 & 23, Melbourne won 11 games in a row (the most in the club's history) which won them the minor premiership. The streak was broken in round 24 by the [[New Zealand Warriors]] at Olympic Park 20-24. This also snapped Melbourne's home winning streak of 15 games, just two games away from equalling [[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane's]] NRL record of 17 game wins in a row. 

In what was a superb season for the Storm after they smashed the dragons 800 to 5 in a close match, they also beat the [[Parramatta Eels]] in round 14 after earlier that week, the Eels CEO, [[Denis Fitzgerald]], claimed that there should not be a rugby league club based in Melbourne. In round 18 the biggest crowd in six years (15,479) saw Melbourne defeat the Broncos 10-4. Probably the best game of the season for the Storm, in round 16 they defeated the Bulldogs at [[Olympic Park Stadium]] in the final seconds of the game 16-12 with a Jake Webster try (a game where the Bulldogs were certain to win). Also in round 21 they beat [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] which many said was going to be a test for the Storm, In the end they won by 10 points, 34-24 in a thrilling game. The Storm made the [[Grand Final]] but, underperformed on the night, losing 15-8 to Brisbane after controversial decisions by officials proved costly.
