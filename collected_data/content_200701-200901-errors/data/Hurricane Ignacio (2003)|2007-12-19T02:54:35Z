'''Hurricane Ignacio''' was the latest-forming first hurricane of a [[Pacific hurricane]] season since reliable satellite observation began in 1966. The ninth tropical storm of the [[2003 Pacific hurricane season]], Ignacio developed out of a [[tropical wave]] on [[August 22]] a short distance off the coast of [[Mexico]]. It was initially predicted to track out to sea and remain a weak tropical storm, though it unexpectedly organized rapidly to attain peak winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on [[August 24]] while located a short distance southeast of southern [[Baja California Sur|Baja California]]. Land interaction weakened Ignacio to an 80 mph hurricane by the time it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], and it dissipated on [[August 27]] in the central region of the [[Baja California peninsula]].

The hurricane produced heavy rainfall in southern Baja California, killing two rescue works from floodwaters. Resort areas near the coast experienced minor effects, though further inland the damage was more severe. The impact of Ignacio was compounded by flooding from [[Hurricane Marty (2003)|Hurricane Marty]] a month later, with damage from the two hurricanes totaling about $1&nbsp;billion (2003&nbsp;USD, $1.1&nbsp;billion 2006&nbsp;USD).

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Ignacio 2003 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] exited the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 6]]. It moved westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] without development, and entered the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[August 16]] after crossing [[Central America]]. Cloudiness and [[convection]] gradually increased along the wave axis and organized into a distinct area of disturbed weather on [[August 20]] while located a short distance south of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Mexico]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Miles B.

The tropical depression moved slowly northwestward, with the slow motion persisting for its entire lifetime due to the storm being embedded within the weakness of a mid-level ridge to its north.<ref name="tcr"/> Shortly after forming, the storm was located in a marginally favorable environment, with westerly wind shear and dry air approached the depression<ref name="disc4">{{cite web|author=Rhome/Lawrence|year=2003|title=Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Four|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2007-01-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/ep092003.discus.004.shtml}}</ref> and leaving the center of circulation exposed from the convection.

[[Image:Hurr Ignacio (2003).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Hurricane Ignacio near peak intensity]]
Hurricane Ignacio continued to quickly intensify after becoming a hurricane, and reached peak winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) later on [[August 24]] while located within 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km/h) of the coast of [[Baja California Sur]].<ref name="tcr"/> Upon reaching peak strength, the hurricane possessed a 12&nbsp;mile (19&nbsp;km) wide surrounded by very deep convection.

On [[August 25]] Ignacio made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] just east of [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] with winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, first deteriorating to a tropical storm 12&nbsp;hours after landfall and later to a tropical depression about a day after moving ashore. Ignacio continued northwestward across the peninsula, and [[Dissipation|dissipated]] on [[August 28]] while located in northwestern Baja California Sur.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
Coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on Ignacio, the government of [[Mexico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] from [[Santa Fe, Baja California Sur|Santa Fe]] to [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], with the watch upgraded to a warning nine hours later. The warning was extended on both coasts from [[Bahia Magdalena, Baja California Sur|Bahia Magdalena]] to [[San Evaristo, Baja California Sur|San Evaristo]] the next day. About 48 hours before Ignacio made landfall, a hurricane warning was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz, and 21 hours later extended to Bahia Magdalena and San Evaristo. The government of Mexico also issued a tropical storm warning for the mainland from [[Atlata, Sinaloa|Atlana]] to [[Topolobampo]] in the state of [[Sinaloa]].<ref name="tcr"/>

The Civil Protection agency for the state of Baja California Sur ordered for the evacuation for 10,000 residents in flood-prone areas near [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]]. Officials also moved 700 people in areas near rivers to shelters in [[Los Cabos]].<ref name="planetark">{{cite news|author=Greg Brosnan|date=2003-08-26|title=Hurricane Ignacio Threatens Mexico's Baja Coast |publisher=PlanetArk|accessdate=2007-01-17|url=http://www.planetark.com/avantgo/dailynewsstory.cfm?newsid=21993}}</ref> 32 emergency shelters were set up in and around La Paz.<ref name="afp825">{{cite news|author=Agence French-Presse|date=2003-08-25|title=Hurricane Ignacio forces 10,000 to take shelter|accessdate=2007-01-18|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/OCHA-64DD6Z?OpenDocument&rc=2&emid=ACOS-635P5A}}</ref> Residents near the coast placed [[sandbag]]s to protect their houses from potential flooding,<ref name="planetark"/> and also stocked up on hurricane supplies.

Just a month after Ignacio, [[Hurricane Marty (2003)|Hurricane Marty]] passed through the area, causing additional damage to areas hit by Ignacio.
