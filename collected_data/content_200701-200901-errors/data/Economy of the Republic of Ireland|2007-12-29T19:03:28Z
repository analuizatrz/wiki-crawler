{{Economy of Ireland table}}
{{Life in the Republic of Ireland}}

The '''[[economic system|economy]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]''' is modern and trade-dependent with growth averaging a robust 10% in 1995&ndash;2000. [[Agriculture]], once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by [[industry]], which accounts for 46% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], about 80% of [[export]]s, and employs 29% of the [[labour force]]. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in [[consumer spending]] and recovery in both [[construction]] and business [[investment]]. The annual rate of [[inflation]] stands at 5.1% [[as of 2007]], up from  recent rates of between 3% and 4%. On the [[EU]] [[HICP]] inflation index, inflation is 2.7% [http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_1010769.shtml], against an EU average of 1.8% . House price inflation has been a particular economic concern (average house price was €251,281 in February 2005).  Unemployment is low but is rising <ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0706/jobs.html|Sharp rise in June unemployment]</ref> and up to 30,000 jobs may be lost between 2007 and 2008<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/business/2007/0713/economy.html|30,000 building jobs to go]</ref> much of which is attributed to a slowdown in house building.

Ireland has the second highest per capita income of any country in the EU next to Luxembourg, and fourth highest in the world based on measurements of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Many economists feel {{fact|date=July 2007}} that GDP per capita is an inappropriate measure of national income for Ireland because it does not consider the repatriation of profits by multinational companies. Gross National Income per capita, takes account of this. In any case, the vast majority of wealth held by Irish citizens is invested in property <ref name="boi_report">{{Citation

==History==
{{main article|Economic history of Ireland|Social Partnership}}

The state known today as Ireland seceded from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1922. The state was troubled by poverty and emigration until the early 1990s. These problems virtually disappeared over the course of that decade, which saw the beginning of unprecedented economic growth, in a phenomenon known as the "[[Celtic Tiger]]". Over the past two decades, the Irish government has implemented a series of national economic programmes designed to curb [[inflation]], ease tax burdens, reduce government spending as a percentage of [[gross domestic product|GDP]], increase labour force skills, and promote foreign investment. Ireland joined in launching the [[euro]] currency system in January 1999 along with ten other [[European Union]] countries. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown in 2001, particularly in the high-tech export sector &ndash; the growth rate in that area was cut by nearly half. GDP growth continued to be exceptionally high in international terms, with a rate of about 6% in 2001 and 2002 &ndash; and it is expected to continue at more than 4 per cent (2006 onwards). Since 2001, GNI (which measures income to Irish residents rather than output) growth has been much slower.

==Infrastructure==
Ireland's transport [[infrastructure]] came under strain due to the economic expansion of the past decade. Since 1993, road transport has been coordinated by the [[National Roads Authority]] in the case of the [[Roads in Ireland|National Primary Routes]], which are the most heavily used roads,<ref>Transport Research Laboratory (August 2003). [http://www.nra.ie/PublicationsResources/DownloadableDocumentation/Transportation/file,863,en.PDF Future Traffic Forecasts, 2002-2040] (pdf). National Roads Authority.</ref>  The [[National Secondary Route]]s act as regional roads and linkages between the primary routes. The [[Dublin]] area is served by a light rail network (the [[Luas]]), the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]] the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]], [[Dublin Airport]], [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] and the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]].

[[Image:DART Unit 8203.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] is a key piece of infrastructure in [[Dublin]] for commuters]]

Ireland's rail network is run by the semi-state body [[Iarnród Éireann]], a subsidiary of [[Córas Iompair Éireann|CIÉ]] and is made up of 9 national lines and several regional commuter lines such as the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]]. CIÉ retain some freight customers, though few new freight services have started in recent years. Only some major ports remain technically freight-connected, the connection at [[Sligo]] for example was removed in 2003, while the link to [[Foynes]] has remained unused since 1999. The efficiency of the train network is poor, with regular delays and overcrowding on major routes. Some regional routes have few services, and as a result, struggle to achieve passengers. Much new rolling stock has been acquired since 1994, and as of 2004, this is finally beginning to expand capacity rather than just replacing old stock. Most major routes have been relaid with continuous welded rail, and signalling has in most cases been upgraded from the more than century-old mechanical semaphores.

The country has a total of 15 airports and airfields, of which 3 - [[Dublin Airport]], [[Shannon Airport]] and [[Cork Airport]] are of a substantial size. The country is served by several airlines, most notably [[Aer Lingus]], [[Ryanair]], [[Aer Arann]], and [[CityJet]]. Air transport is relatively cheap. The main ports are [[Rosslare Europort]], [[Limerick]], [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Waterford]]. There are daily ferry services to Britain.

The mobile market has four providers - [[3 (telecommunications)|3 Ireland]], [[O2 Ireland]], [[Meteor (mobile network)|Meteor]] and [[Vodafone Ireland]]. The electricity transmission system is run by the [[Electricity Supply Board]] and is available nationwide. The gas network is currently being expanded.

==Energy==
The vast majority of Irish energy needs are met by fossil fuels. About 98% of Ireland's final energy demand is produced by burning [[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[peat]], or [[natural gas]]. This over reliance on fossil fuels - particularly oil - has left the Ireland vulnerable to international price fluctuations as it imports all of its oil needs. As part of its [[National Development Plan]] the Government adopted the ''Sustainable Energy Act (2002)'' and created Sustainable Energy Ireland as the nation's energy regulator. As part of their objectives to promote environmentally and economically sustainable energy production, electrical generation from peat consumption, as a percent of total electrical generation, was reduced from 18.8% to 6.1%, between 1990 and 2004.<ref name=energy>Howley, Martin, Fergal O’Leary, and Brian Ó Gallachóir (January 2006). [http://193.178.1.196/getFile.asp?FC_ID=1067&docID=68 Energy in Ireland 1990 – 2004: Trends, issues, forecasts and indicators] (pdf), p10, 20, 26.</ref> Likewise, coal consumption was reduced from 41.7% to 27.6%. Making up for this, the share of natural gas in  electrical generation increased from 26.7% to 44.8%. Renewable energy, from biomass, wind and hydro, also increased from 1.9% to 2.6% in the same time period. A forecast by Sustainable Energy Ireland predicts that oil will no longer be used for electrical generation but natural gas will be dominant at 71.3% of the total share, coal at 9.2%, and renewable energy at 8.2% of the market.<ref name=energy/>  Wind power is quickly developing in the country by [[Airtricity]] and Hibernia Wind Energy (a subsidiary of the [[Electricity Supply Board]]) and many other companies. As of December 2005, there were fifty wind farms operational in Ireland with a combined capacity of 500&nbsp;MW - generating enough energy for 300,000 homes, depending on wind conditions. In addition, a further 600&nbsp;MW of wind farms (40 more) have signed connection agreements to link to the power system at high voltage or low voltage, and up to 200&nbsp;MW of wind farms have received connection offers. Should these reach capacity, Ireland may exceed its EU target of 13.2 per cent of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2010.  In addition to wind farms, electricity is also generated at large scale hydro schemes on the Shannon, Erne, Liffey and Lee rivers, and at mini-hydro stations, as well as landfill gas generating plants in Cork and Dublin cities.

==Monetary system==
As the country is a member of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[euro]] is the currency. The most common bills in circulation are the €5, €10, €20 and €50, the €100, €200 and €500 bills are rarely seen. The [[Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland]] is the country's central bank and financial services regulator, and an agent for the [[European Central Bank]] which sets the interest rates. The low interest rates of the ECB - to stimulate the [[Eurozone]] - has helped to sustain the very high growth rate of Ireland, leading to high levels of inflation in the country. For example, increased inflation on housing, from IRE£9,000 (€11,430) in 1973 to €220,000 in 2004 has led to young couples accepting large mortgages and the wealthy buying investment properties. It is arguable that if Ireland had its own currency, interest rates would be higher and inflation would be reduced- however so would economic growth. Fears of overheating (that is excessive growth) of the economy due to the Euro seem to be unfounded, at least up to the present.

==Economic sectors==
[[Image:Irish economy.png|thumb|300px|The chart displays the make up of Irish GDP]]
The Irish economy's secondary and tertiary sectors are of a similar size in fiscal terms however in terms of labour, the tertiary sector is far larger. Similarly in fiscal terms the primary sector appears small, however it still employs about 8% of the workforce. 

===Primary sector===
The primary sector constitutes 5% of Irish [[GDP]], and 8% of Irish employment. Ireland's main economic resource is its large fertile pastures, particularly the midland and southern regions. In 2004, Ireland exported approximately €7.15 billion worth of agri-food and drink (about 8.4% of Ireland's exports), mainly as cattle, beef, and dairy products, and mainly to the United Kingdom.<ref>Bord Bia (March 2005).

===Secondary sector===
The secondary sector constitutes 46% of Irish GDP &mdash; but only 29% of the labour force. Dominated for many years by textile companies like [[Fruit of the Loom]], the sector is now largely made up of high-tech/high value multi-nationals such as [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Intel]], [[Pfizer]] and [[IBM]]. The secondary sector in Ireland manufactures products such as [[computers]] (25% of Europe's computers are made in Ireland, the European Headquarters of [[Apple Computer]] are in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] City), computer parts (Intel processors are made in Ireland), [[medication|drugs]] (much of Europe's supply of [[Viagra]] is made in Cork), [[confectionery]] ([[HB (Unilever)|HB]], [[Jacobs]] and [[Cadbury-Schweppes]] all have significant Irish operations - although Cadbury-Schweppes does not manufacture Schweppes products in Ireland or the UK), [[beer]] (the [[Guinness]] and [[Smithwicks]], and [[Harp Lager]] breweries are located in Ireland), high quality [[glass]] and [[crystal]] ([[Waterford Crystal]] is made in [[County Waterford]]), [[software]] (Ireland is the world's largest exporter of software - [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] both have large operations in Dublin) and [[machinery]]. The sector faces increasing competition from cheaper Eastern European countries such as [[Poland]] and many Asian countries such as the [[People's Republic of China]], particularly in the lower skill areas such as [[confectionery]] manufacturing. The industrial production growth rate in [[As of 2003|2003]] was 6.7%. Over the last decade, construction has become a major component of the economy, currently constituting 9% of economic activity. A recent downturn in residential property market sentiment, combined with the cyclical nature of construction has highlighted the over-exposure of the Irish economy to construction, which now presents a threat to economic growth<ref name="oecd_survey"/><ref name="rte_article_slowdown"/>.
[[Image:Newgrange ireland 750px.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Tourist sites such as [[Newgrange]], [[County Meath]] are vital to the Irish economy]]

===Tertiary sector===
The tertiary sector constitutes 49% of Irish GDP and 64% of Irish employment. The tertiary sector is by far the largest driver of modern Irish economic growth &mdash; the ''[[Celtic Tiger]]''. It is made up of several industries such as [[accountancy]],  [[legal]] services, [[call center|call centres]] and customer service operations, [[finance]] and stock broking, [[catering]], and [[tourism]]. Many US firms (such as [[IBM]] and [[Apple Computer]]) located their European customer service operations in Ireland due to the availability of a young, highly educated, English speaking workforce. [[Recruitment in Ireland|Recruitment agencies]] also play a major role in this sector, connecting qualified work candidates to business clients looking to hire in these areas. The Irish tourism industry attracts over five million visitors annually and employs over 100,000. The [[IFSC]] in [[Dublin]] created some 14,000 jobs in the 1990s, all in the high-value finance and legal sectors. The hospitality and retail sectors are quite large &mdash; there are hundreds of domestic and foreign retail firms in Ireland (such as [[Next (retailer)|Next]] and [[Argos]]), and most cafe and restaurant firms operate in Ireland such as [[McDonalds]], [[Starbucks]], [[Burger King]] and [[Subway (sandwich)|Subway]].

==State role in the economy==
===State ownership===
At present the [[Irish Government]] controls several large and key parts of the economy:
*Through [[Córas Iompair Éireann]] (CIE) it controls most{{Fact|date=February 2007}} of the [[bus]] and all of the [[railway]] market. A significant portion{{Fact|date=February 2007}} of the scheduled land transport services are accounted for through CIE companies.
*Through the [[Electricity Supply Board]] (ESB) the government controls much{{Fact|date=February 2007}} of the [[electricity generation]] market, and all of the [[electricity transmission]] network.
*Through [[RTÉ]] the government control much{{Fact|date=February 2007}} of the radio and television broadcast sector, although commercial enterprises are gaining market share. The state does not generally use the media it owns to spread [[propaganda]], but it has a large [[financial]] and [[regulatory]] control of the sector.
*Through [[An Post]], the government has a monopoly of the light mail delivery industry and a large portion{{Fact|date=February 2007}} of the partially deregulated parcel and express delivery market.

Although the government owns the incumbents in the electricity, mail, broadcasting, land transport and air transport industries, many are wholly or partially open to competition from the private sector. Traditionally large and key sectors of the economy were dominated by government ownership.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Some of these industries are currently being reformed and opened to competition however some of them are regarded as being slow to adopt change and reform to work practice &mdash; work pay and conditions are often much better than that in the private sector with some having overstaffing or underproductivity which is seen as an impediment to reform.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The government in 2006 [[privatised]] [[Aer Lingus]] and is currently considering the [[privatisation]] of part of the [[Electricity Supply Board]], but it is somewhat reluctant because of an earlier situation that resulted from the privatisation of [[Eircom]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In that case, hundreds of thousands of small shareholders lost money, private investors took control and established a virtual monopoly, while  under-investment led to a slow roll out of [[broadband]] infrastructure.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Taxation===
{{main|Taxation in the Republic of Ireland}}

The present government (1997&ndash;) has favoured a low taxation policy to encourage [[foreign direct investment]] in Ireland.  Consequently, the government opposes moves by the [[European Commission]] to restrict [[tax competition]].  The previous government of 1994-1997 introduced a corporate tax rate is only 12.5%, versus between 15% and 60% in the rest of Europe.  The income tax system is designed to [[redistribution|redistribute]] wealth from the richer to the poorer segments of society. There are 2 tax bands, based on income levels. These range from a maximum top rate of 41%, to a maximum bottom rate of 20%. In reality, however, a generous tax credits system ensures that the lower rates of taxation are normally 4% to 12%. The top rate of tax never exceeds 35% in practice.

The government receives much of its revenues from taxes on goods &mdash; these include a 21% [[VAT]] rate on most consumer goods, high levels of [[excise duty]] on [[tobacco]], [[petrol]], and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and several smaller taxes on items such as plastic bags, [[cheque]]s, [[automatic teller machine|ATM]] cards, [[credit card]]s and [[debit card]]s. The taxes in the personal financial sector, as well as [[television licensing in the Republic of Ireland|the television licence]], are often seen as [[regressive tax|regressive]].

===The welfare state===
The Irish government runs a [[Welfare state]] system. The government provides free [[education]] at all levels for all EU citizens. Hospital care is free to all, though lower earners or people dependant on benefits receive all medical services for no charge, including dental, oral and aural services. People who are unemployed receive [[unemployment benefit]]s and retired people are entitled to a [[pension|state pension]] - both benefits are quite high by international comparisons. However, recent changes in the cost of living in Ireland have greatly eroded their relative buying power. Pension payments will increase to €200 (non-contributory) and €209.30 (contributory) per week in 2007.[http://www.unison.ie/features/budget2007/news/stories.php3?ca=435&si=1736600]

===Health care===
{{main|Health care in Ireland}}

All persons resident in the Ireland are entitled to receive health care through the public health care system, the [[Health Service Executive]]. A person may be required to pay for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability. All child health and maternity services are provided free of charge as is emergency care. The "medical card", which entitles holders to eligibility for free health care, is available to those receiving welfare payments, low earners, all persons aged 70 or over (regardless of income) and those with certain long-term or severe illnesses.<ref>Irish eGovernment.

In-patient or day services at a hospital costs €60.00 per day up to a maximum of €600.00 per year.

The health system, despite having billions spent on it in recent years, has some problems.

===Education===
{{main|Education in Ireland}}

The [[Education in Ireland|education system]] is comparatively very good with standards in [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[technology]] being among the highest in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] member nations. The state has a virtual [[monopoly]] in [[higher education]] &mdash; there are few private colleges and these are highly specialised. The primary and secondary school enrolment levels are over 95% and at these levels choice is wide. Third level entry is competitive; all college and university tuition fees are free and courses adjusted to the needs of the economy. Irish adult literacy is 99% &mdash; in line with other OECD countries.

The only recognized universities are [[Dublin City University]], [[National University of Ireland]] (with ''constituent universities'' at [[University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork|Cork]], [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]]), [[University of Limerick]] and [[University of Dublin]]. The [[Regional Technical College|Institute of Technology]] system has recently overtaken the universities in terms of first year enrolment numbers and this trend appears to be accelerating.

==Economic ties==
===United States===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pfizer logo.png|thumb|150px|[[Pfizer]] was one of the first foreign multi-nationals to locate in Ireland. It did so in the 1960s and today it still employs several thousand workers in [[County Cork]].]] -->
In 2003, [[trade]] between [[Ireland]] and the [[United States]] was worth around $33 billion, a $4 billion increase over 2002. U.S. [[export]]s to Ireland were valued at $7.7 billion, an increase of almost $1 billion over 2002. Irish exports to the U.S. were worth some $25.7 billion &mdash; a 500% increase since 1997. Ireland had a trade surplus of over $15 billion with the U.S. in 2003.<ref>U.S. Census Bureau. [http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4190.html#2004 Trade with Ireland : 2004.] Trade in Goods (Imports, Exports and Trade Balance) with Ireland. Retrieved on [[7 August]] [[2006]].</ref> The range of U.S. products imported to Ireland includes [[electricity|electrical]] components, [[computers]] and [[peripheral]]s, [[pharmacology|drugs and pharmaceuticals]], electrical equipment, and [[livestock]] feed. Exports to the United States include [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[Chemical industry|chemicals]] and related products, [[electronics|electronic]] [[data processing]] equipment, electrical [[machinery]], [[textiles]] and [[clothing]], and [[glass]]ware.

U.S. [[foreign direct investment]] in Ireland has been particularly important to the growth and modernization of Irish industry since 1980, providing new [[technology]], export capabilities, and [[employment]] opportunities. The major U.S. investments in Ireland to date have included multi-billion dollar investments by [[Intel]], [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]] and [[Abbott Laboratories]]. Currently, there are more than 600 U.S. subsidiaries operating in Ireland, employing in excess of 100,000 people and spanning activities from manufacturing of high-tech electronics, computer products, [[medical]] supplies, and pharmaceuticals to [[retailer|retailing]], [[banking]] and [[finance]], and other services. Many U.S. businesses find Ireland an attractive location to manufacture for the [[European Union|EU]] market, since as a member of the EU it has tariff free access to the European Common Market. Government policies are generally formulated to facilitate trade and inward direct investment. The availability of an educated, well-trained, [[English language|English]]-speaking work force and relatively moderate wage costs have been important factors. Ireland offers good long-term growth prospects for U.S. companies under an innovative financial incentive programme, including capital grants and favourable [[tax]] treatment, such as a low [[corporation]] [[income tax]] rate for [[manufacturing]] firms and certain financial services firms.

[[Image:Friesian-Holstein.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Once a beneficiary of the EU — particularly of [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]] grant &mdash; Ireland is now a net contributor to the EU]]

===European Union===
Although the USA is the single most important economic partner, it lags by far the EU as a whole which accounts for 63.3% of Ireland's exports (US 18.7%) and 57.4% of her imports (US 14.1%). (data for 2005)<ref>http://www.economist.com/countries/Ireland/profile.cfm?folder=Profile%2DEconomic%20Structure</ref>.

Ireland has grown much closer to [[Europe]] in recent years &mdash; particularly since it joined the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1973. It is also part of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]] and thus has the [[euro]] as its currency. Many US companies have located their European headquarters in Ireland and this has led to increased Irish-European ties. Ireland regularly comes near the top in polls of the most enthusiastic Europeans<ref>Coakley , Chris (31 August 2004). [http://futurum2004.eun.org/ww/en/pub/futurum2004/news/enlargement_news/new_year.htm European citizens pessimistic about 2004: poll.] Spring Day in Europe: Enlargement news. Retrieved on [[7 August]] [[2006]].</ref> and spent some €60m during its presidency of the EU. The EU now accounts for the bulk of Irish trade, with the [[United Kingdom]] being the largest trading partner. Ireland's main exports to Europe are [[beef]], [[computers]] ([[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]],   and [[Apple Computer]] all have manufacturing facilities in Ireland) and [[software]] ([[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] have their European Headquarters in Ireland). Ireland's major imports from Europe include [[automobile|car]]s, [[machinery]], [[truck]]s, [[steel]], oil and consumer goods.
A major economic bonus Ireland has received from EU membership has been agricultural subsidies from the [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]] and large amounts of EU investment in Irish road infrastructure. Since the acceptance of the 10 new Eastern European nations in 2004, Ireland's ties with Europe further increased. Since the accession event in 2004, several hundred thousand workers from countries such as [[Latvia]], [[Poland]] and [[Estonia]], no longer requiring work permits, came to live and work in Ireland.

==Wealth distribution==
[[Image:Ireland income distribution chart.gif|thumb|left|230px|Disposable income per person as a percentage of the national average.]] 
Like many Western democracies wealth is partially redistributed among the poorer segments of society through the [[progressive tax]] system. Large disparities in wealth exist between those employed and those dependent on welfare payments. The percentage of the population at risk of [[relative poverty]] was 21% in 2004 -  one of the highest rates in the European Union.<ref>Central Statistics Office, Ireland (June 2006). [http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2005/progress2005/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf Measuring Ireland's Progress: 2005] (pdf). ISBN 0-7557-7142-7.</ref> Levels of wealth higher than the national average are concentrated among people living in the central eastern region and in [[Dublin]]. Despite this, there are many areas in Dublin marked by relative poverty, particularly in the [[inner city]]. The poorest members of society are those entirely dependent on welfare payments. Ireland's inequality of income distribution score on the [[Gini coefficient]] scale was 30.4 in 2000, slightly below the OECD average of 31.<ref>OECD. [http://stats.oecd.org/WBOS/ViewHTML.aspx?QueryName=186&QueryType=View&Lang=en Country statistical profiles 2006: Ireland.] OECD Statistics. Retrieved on [[7 August]] [[2006]].</ref> Ireland's 2000 score was less than 9 of the OECD member states but higher than 13 members. This has changed substantially since these statistics were published (see [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland#Recent Developments|Recent Developments]]). 

The national [[minimum wage]] is €8.65 per hour for full time staff over the age of 18 &mdash; this is one of the highest in the world. It is above the threshold for free healthcare assuming that the individual is single, has no children and works full-time. From 2007, someone working 39 hours per week at this rate will be exempt from income tax, as income below €17,600 per year will not be taxed.  [[Unemployment benefit]] (''the dole'') and Jobseeker's Allowance for a single person in Ireland will be €181.80 per week, as of January 2007.<ref>Irish eGovernment.  [http://www.budget.gov.ie/2007/budgetsummary07.html#_Toc153101621]. Retrieved on [[6 December]] [[2006]].</ref> This compares to £57.45 (€83.10) per week for a single person aged 25 or over in the UK.<ref>Government of the United Kingdom. [http://www.direct.gov.uk/Bfsl1/BenefitsAndFinancialSupport/BenefitsAndFinancialSupportArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10018757&chk=A1h/UxJobseeker's Allowance factsheet.] Money, tax and benefits. Retrieved on [[7 August]] [[2006]].</ref> 

In contrast to most other countries in the [[European Union]]  (with the exception of the UK, Greece and Hungary) Ireland has high rates of [[home ownership]]. In particular, [[house]] ownership (at approximately 80%) is the norm. In [[Continental Europe]] [[renting]] is the norm. [[Social housing]] schemes do exist and the government has invested €8.5 billion in the provision of over 34,000 social housing units between 2000 and 2005. Average rents for 2 bedroom apartments in Dublin range from €1,069.00 to €1,269.00 per four-week period.<ref>Coleman, Marc (2 August 2006). [http://www.daft.ie/report/index.daft House Prices Hang over a Sloping Hillside.] Retrieved on [[7 August]] [[2006]].</ref> A single person living in shared accommodation can receive up to €98.00 per week (€392.00 every 4 weeks) in rent supplement.<ref>Irish eGovernment. [http://www.oasis.gov.ie/housing/renting_a_flat_or_house/help_with_paying_the_rent.html#id3145622 Help with paying the rent]. Retrieved on [[7 August]] [[2006]].</ref> Therefore house sharing in rented accommodation is quite common in Ireland among single people receiving welfare payments and single people on low pay.

===Recent Developments===
In recent years, large and sustained increases in property values have had a substantial impact on the [[distribution of wealth#Real estate|distribution of wealth]]. The high level of inequality in Ireland today is evident from an annual publication<ref name="boi_report"/> issued by the [[Bank of Ireland]] detailing the sources of wealth in Ireland.
