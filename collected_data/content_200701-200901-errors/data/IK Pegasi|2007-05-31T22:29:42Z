'''IK Pegasi''' (or '''HR 8210''') is a [[binary|binary]] [[star system]] in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]. The primary (IK Pegasi A) is a [[main sequence]], [[spectral class|A-type]] star that displays minor pulsations in luminosity.<ref name="nras278" /> Its companion (IK Pegasi B) is a high-temperature [[white dwarf]]; a star that has evolved past the main sequence and is no longer generating energy through [[nuclear fusion]]. They orbit around each other every 21.7 days with an average separation of about 31 million kilometres, or 0.21 [[astronomical unit]]s. This is smaller than the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] around the [[Sun]].

This is the nearest known [[supernova]] candidate. When the primary begins to evolve into a [[red giant]], it is expected to grow to a radius where the white dwarf can [[Accretion (science)|accrete]] matter from the expanded gaseous envelope. When the white dwarf approaches the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of 1.44 [[solar mass]]es, it will explode as a [[Type Ia supernova]].<ref>{{cite news

Examination of the [[spectrograph]]ic features of this star showed that characteristic [[absorption line]] shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a shift in the wavelength of the line features. (See [[redshift]].) The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity of at least one of the stars, even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.

In 1927, the Canadian astronomer [[William Edmund Harper|William E. Harper]] used this technique to measure the period of this single-line spectroscopic binary, and determined it to be 21.724 days. He also estimated the [[orbital eccentricity]] as 0.027. (Later estimates gave an eccentricity of essentially zero, which is the value for a circular orbit.)<ref name="mnras262">{{cite journal

==Component A==
The [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] is a plot of [[luminosity]] versus surface [[temperature]] for a set of stars. IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the [[instability strip]]. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.<ref name="araa33">{{cite journal

The pulsations result from a process called the ''κ''-mechanism. A part of the star's atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements, which causes the atmosphere to expand in compensation. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and looses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere, and a matching variation of the luminosity.<ref name="araa33" />

[[Image:Size IK Peg.png|right|320px|thumb|The relative dimensions of IK Pegasi A (left), B (lower center) and the Sun (right).]]
Stars within the portion of the instability strip that crosses the main sequence are called [[Delta Scuti variable]]s. (These are named after the prototypical star for such variables: [[Delta Scuti]].) Delta Scuti variables typically range from spectral class A2 to F8, and a stellar luminosity class of III ([[subgiant]]s) to V ([[main sequence]] stars). They are short-period variables that have a regular pulsation rate between 0.025 and 0.25 days. Delta Scuti stars have an abundance of elements similar to the Sun's ([[Population I]] stars), and between 1.5 and 2.5 [[solar mass]]es.<ref>{{cite web

Astronomers define the [[metallicity]] of a star as the abundance of [[isotope]]s that have a higher [[atomic number]] than hydrogen and helium. This is measured by a [[spectroscopic]] analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is [M/H]&nbsp;=&nbsp;+0.06&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.20.  This notation gives the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. That is, if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero. A logarithmic value of 0.06 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.15, so the star is about 15% richer in metallic elements than the Sun.<ref name="mnras267" /> However the margin of error for this result is relatively high.

The spectrum of A-type stars show strong [[Balmer line]]s of hydrogen along with absorption lines of ionized metals, including the K&nbsp;line of ionized [[calcium]] (Ca&nbsp;II) at a wavelength of 393.3&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]].<ref>{{cite web

Spectral class A stars are hotter and more massive than the Sun. But, in consequence, their life span on the main sequence is correspondingly brief. For a star with a mass similar to IK Pegasi A, the expected lifetime on the [[main sequence]] is 2&ndash;3&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;years, which is about half the current age of the Sun.<ref>{{cite web

In terms of mass, the relatively young [[Altair]] is the nearest star to the Sun that is a stellar analogue of component A&mdash;it has an estimated 1.7 times the [[solar mass]]. The binary system as a whole has been compared to [[Sirius]], which has a type-A primary and a white dwarf companion. Sirius A, however, is more massive than IK Pegasi A and the orbit of its companion is larger, with a semimajor axis is 20 A.U.

==Component B==
The companion star is a dense [[white dwarf]] star. This category of stellar object has reached the end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through [[nuclear fusion]]. Instead, under normal circumstances, a white dwarf will gradually radiate away its remaining energy, growing cooler and dimmer over the course of many billions of years.

===Evolution===
Nearly all small and intermediate-mass stars (below about eight [[solar mass]]es) will end up as a white dwarf once they have exhausted their supply of hydrogen and helium fuel.<ref name="evolution">{{cite web

As its hydrogen fuel at the core became consumed, this star evolved into a [[red giant]]. The inner core contracted until it reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. The fusion of helium began to form an inert core of carbon and oxygen. If the star had sufficient mass, in time this core too would initiate [[Carbon burning process|fusion of carbon]] into oxygen, with neon and magnesium as by-products.<ref name="evolution" />

Some time after an inert oxygen-carbon (or oxygen-neon) core formed, the star began to pulsate due to instability in the rate of fusion. Helium fusion is very sensitive to temperature changes, so a slight increase in heat results in a significant increase in energy output. This causes an expansion, which lowers the temperature again. This feedback loop results in large oscillations of energy production. The pulsations of the star caused the outer hydrogen-rich envelope to be ejected from the surface over a period of time, forming an immense cloud of material called a [[planetary nebula]]. All but a small fraction of the hydrogen is driven away from the star, leaving behind a white dwarf remnant composed primarily of the core.<ref name="apjs76">{{cite journal

==Future evolution==
While studying this star system for a college paper, [[Harvard University]] student Karin Sandstrom discovered that HR 8210 is a prime candidate for a [[Type Ia supernova]]. At a distance of 150 light years, this made it the nearest known supernova candidate to the [[Earth]]. This is also inside what is thought to be the minimum safe distance of 160&ndash;200 light years. A supernova event within this radius could effectively destroy the Earth's [[ozone layer]], and very likely would have a severe impact on the planet's [[biosphere]].<ref>{{cite news

At some point in the future, IK Pegasus A will have consumed the hydrogen fuel at its core and will start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasus A has expanded to the point where its outer envelope overflows the [[Roche lobe]] of its companion, a gaseous [[accretion disk]] will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, then begins to accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars also causes their mutual orbit to shrink.<ref>{{cite web

On the surface of the white dwarf, the accreted gas becomes compressed and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface.

It is possible that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern, although most recurrent novae are believed to occur over longer periods ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 years.<ref name="vsom0501" /> In order to accumulate mass, however, only a portion of the accreted gas can be ejected. So with each cycle the white dwarf steady increases in mass. Thus, even should it behave as a recurring nova, IK Pegasus B can continue to accumulate a growing envelope.<ref>{{cite journal

An alternate model that allows the white dwarf to steadily accumulate mass without erupting as a nova is called the close-binary [[supersoft x-ray source]] (CBSS). In this scenario, the mass transfer rate to the close white dwarf binary is such that a steady fusion burn can be maintained on the surface as the arriving hydrogen is consumed in thermonuclear fusion to produce helium. This category of super-soft sources consist of high-mass white dwarfs with very high surface temperatures (0.5&ndash;1 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;K<ref>{{cite conference

Once the white dwarf's mass approaches the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of 1.44 [[solar mass]]es it can no longer be supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]] and it will undergo a collapse. Within a short time period, a substantial fraction of the matter in the star undergoes nuclear fusion. This is sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.<ref>{{cite web

This supernova event is not likely to pose a threat to life on the Earth, however. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4&nbsp;km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700 years. After 5 million years, this star will be separated from the Sun by more than 500 light years. This is outside the radius where a Type Ia supernova is thought to be hazardous.<ref>{{cite web

Following the supernova explosion, the remnant of the donor star continues with the final velocity it possessed when it was a member of a close orbiting binary system. Thus it could have a relative velocity of 100&ndash;200 km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the [[Milky Way|galaxy]]. The companion would also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it would evolve into a single, white dwarf star.<ref>{{cite journal
