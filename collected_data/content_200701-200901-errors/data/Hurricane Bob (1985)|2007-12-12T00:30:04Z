'''Hurricane Bob''' was a minimal [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] that affected the [[Southeastern United States|southeast United States]] in July, 1985. The second tropical storm and first hurricane of the [[1985 Atlantic hurricane season]], Bob developed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[July 21]] in the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Afterwards, Bob began moving eastward, finally striking southwestern [[Florida]] as a minimal tropical storm. Bob then turned to the north, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on [[July 24]]. The next day, it made landfall near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], becoming one of a record-tying six hurricanes to hit the United States in a hurricane season, something that had not happened since [[1916 Atlantic hurricane season|1916]].<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851-2005|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-11-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt}}</ref> Bob quickly weakened over land, and was absorbed by a frontal [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] over eastern [[West Virginia]] on [[July 26]].

Throughout its path, Bob caused $20&nbsp;million in damage (1985 [[United States dollar|USD]], $37.6&nbsp;million 2006 USD) and five indirect deaths from traffic fatalities. In Florida, the storm produced heavy rainfall, including over 20&nbsp;inches (500&nbsp;mm) in [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]]. Along most of its path, the rainfall was beneficial due to lower than normal rainfall throughout the year. Damage was minimal in South Carolina where the hurricane made landfall. In Virginia, the storm spawned three [[tornado]]es, one of which destroyed two houses.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Bob 1985 track.png}}
The remnants of a [[tropical wave]] entered the southeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on [[July 20]]. An [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] formed, and following the formation of a low-level circulation, it developed into a tropical depression on [[July 21]], while located 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) west-northwest of [[Naples, Florida]]. Under weak steering currents, the tropical depression drifted to the southeast, then turned to the northeast, and later to the east. Based on reports from [[Hurricane Hunters]], it is estimated the system intensified into Tropical Storm ''[[Bob]]'' late on [[July 22]], while located 125&nbsp;miles (200&nbsp;km) west-northwest of Naples. Bob failed to organize significantly while tracking eastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and made landfall between Naples and [[Fort Myers, Florida]] on [[July 23]] as a 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm, with most of the convection located to the south and east of the center.<ref name="tcr1">{{cite web|author=Miles B. Lawrence|year=1985|title=Hurricane Bob Preliminary Report Page 1|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-10-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1985-prelim/bob/prelim01.gif}}</ref>

While moving across Florida, Bob turned to the northeast, then to the north; subsequently, it left the peninsula, moving into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] early on [[July 24]] near [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]]. As it moved over the warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]], it quickly strengthened and organized, and Bob intensified into a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]] late on the 24th, while located 70&nbsp;miles (115&nbsp;km) east of [[Jacksonville, Florida]].<ref name="tcr1"/> Because it was embedded within the western extension of the [[subtropical ridge]], Bob retained higher than normal pressures throughout its lifespan, and its minimum central pressure was 1002&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.59&nbsp;[[inHg]]).<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Robert A. Case|year=1986|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1985|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-10-29|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1985.pdf}}</ref> The hurricane continued northward, and made landfall near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]] early on [[July 25]], carrying winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). Bob quickly weakened over land, decaying into a tropical storm three hours after landfall, and degenerating into a tropical depression after the passage of another 12&nbsp;hours, near the [[North Carolina]]/[[Virginia]] border. It turned to the north-northeast, and was absorbed by a frontal [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] over eastern [[West Virginia]] on [[July 26]].<ref name="tcr1"/> Its area of disturbed weather remained separate from the trough, and continued northeastward through the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] while moving around a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its southeast.<ref name="rain">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2005|title=Rainfall Data for Hurricane Bob|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2006-10-29|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/bob1985.html}}</ref>

==Preparations==
When Bob became a tropical storm, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued gale warnings for the [[Florida Keys]] west of [[Craig Key]], and also from [[Flamingo, Florida|Flamingo]] to [[Venice, Florida|Venice]]. Gale warnings were later issued for the Atlantic coast of Florida northward through [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].<ref name="tcr4">{{cite web|author=Miles B. Lawrence|year=1985|title=Hurricane Bob Preliminary Report Page 4|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-10-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1985-prelim/bob/prelim04.gif}}</ref> Small craft were advised to remain at port south of St. Augustine.<ref name="flstuff">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|publishdate=1985-07-24|title=Tropical storm Bob hitting Florida hard|accessdate=2006-10-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=19775979&firstvisit=true&currentResult=6&currentPage=0}}</ref> While located off the east-central coast of Florida, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a gale warning and a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Little River, South Carolina]]. After Bob intensified into a hurricane, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning.<ref name="tcr1"/> 

Thousands of people evacuated coastal areas of South Carolina, many of which stayed at inland hotels. 850&nbsp;people stayed at shelters, including 500 at an elementary school in [[Horry County, South Carolina|Horry County]] and 240 in a shelter in the [[Grand Strand]]. In [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort County]], where the storm came ashore, officials closed city and county offices early, and advised businesses to send their workers home early on the day of Bob's landfall. Officials in [[Chatham County, Georgia]] evacuated nursing homes on [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]], and recommended others to leave, due to high [[tide]]s potentially isolating the island by cutting off [[U.S. Highway 80]]. As a result, around half of the island was expected to leave.<ref name="scprep">{{Cite news|author=Associated Press|publishdate=1985-07-25|title=Hurricane Bob Batters Georgia-South Carolina Coast|accessdate=2006-10-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=20555201&firstvisit=true&currentResult=4&currentPage=10}}</ref>

==Impact==
Throughout its path, Hurricane Bob left $20 million in damage<ref name="chap8">{{cite web|author=Department of the Army|year=2004|title=Chapter 8: Civil Works - DAHSUM FY 1985|accessdate=2006-10-30|url=http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1985/ch08.htm}}</ref> and five indirect deaths.

===Florida===
[[Image:TS Bob (1985).JPG|right|thumb|200px|Tropical Storm Bob making landfall on Florida]]
In south Florida, rainfall remained to the south and east of the center, and the most rainfall associated with the passage of Bob through the area was 21.5 inches (546 mm) in [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]].<ref name="mwr"/> Most other areas in southern Florida received over 3 inches (75 mm), while in the northern portion of the state areas reported between trace amounts to 3 inches (75 mm) of precipitation.<ref name="rain"/> The storm produced light to moderate wind speeds.

===Carolinas, Mid-Atlantic, and New England===
[[Image:Bob1985rain.gif|right|thumb|200px|Rainfall totals from Hurricane Bob]]
The strongest winds of Hurricane Bob were to the east of the center. [[Georgetown, South Carolina]], located 105 miles (165 km) northeast of the storm's landfall, recorded sustained winds of 58 mph (94 km/h), the highest sustained wind reported by a coastal station. A spiral [[rainband]] produced a peak wind gust of 83 mph (133 km/h) in [[Holden Beach, North Carolina]], located about 175 miles (280 km) from where the storm made landfall. Upon making landfall, the hurricane produced an estimated storm tide of 2.6 feet (0.8 m) in [[Edisto Beach, South Carolina]].<ref name="mwr"/> Rainfall in the Carolinas was moderate, with coastal locations of South Carolina receiving over 5 inches of rain.<ref name="rain"/> [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] reported a state peak of 7.79 inches (198 mm).<ref name="mwr"/> Much of [[North Carolina]] received over 1 inch (25 mm) of rain from the storm, with over 7 inches (180 mm) recorded in [[Beaufort County, North Carolina]].<ref name="rain"/>

Hurricane force wind gusts downed trees and power lines, leaving over 32,000 people without power including over 25,000 in the [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] area.

In the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]], Bob produced light rain of around 1 inch (25 mm), with some isolated locations reporting over 3 inches (75 mm). Southeastern [[New England]] generally received around 1 inch (25 mm) of rain from the remnants of Bob, though central [[Connecticut]] reported over 3 inches.<ref name="rain"/> The remnants of Bob produced a half-inch (12 mm) of rain in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] in just 10 minutes.<ref name="apstuffing">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|publishdate=1985-07-26|title=Remnants of Hurricane Bob drops heavy rains on Northeast|accessdate=2006-10-30|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=22533014&firstvisit=true&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref> In [[Maryland]], where dry conditions existed, the rainfall was beneficial.<ref name="maryhurhis">{{cite web|author=David Lesher|publishdate=1985-08-19|title=Hurricanes' remnants often give Maryland problems|publisher=The Frederic Post|accessdate=2006-10-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=33195327&firstvisit=true&currentResult=1&currentPage=0}}</ref>  

In [[Virginia]], a large band of thunderstorms from the center produced strong winds and led to the formation of three [[tornado]]es.
