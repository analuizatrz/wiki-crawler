'''Malta''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Malta.ogg|[ˈmɔːltə]}}, officially the '''Republic of Malta''' ({{lang-mt|Repubblika ta' Malta}}), is a small and densely populated [[European microstates|European]] [[microstate]], comprising an [[archipelago]] of seven islands, making it an [[island nation]]. Situated in [[Southern Europe]], {{km to mi|93|abbr=yes}} off the coast of [[Sicily]] ([[Italy]]), it is located in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], giving the country a warm, [[Mediterranean climate]], while a further {{km to mi|288|abbr=yes}} to the island's west is [[Tunisia]] and south is  [[Libya]] (about {{km to mi|300|abbr=yes}}).<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mt.html#Geo CIA Factbook] - Geographic location</ref><ref>[http://www.doi.gov.mt/en/islands/location.asp The Maltese Islands], Department of Information - Malta.</ref> The nation's ''[[de facto]]'' capital city is the historic [[Valletta]].

Throughout much of its history, Malta has been considered a crucial strategic location due in large part to its position in the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://home.wanadoo.nl/bezver/introduc.html|publisher=A History of Malta|title=Situation|date=[[6 February]] [[2008]]}}</ref> It was held by several ancient cultures including [[Sicily|Sicilians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Phoenician]]s, [[Byzantine]]s and others. The island is commonly associated with the [[Knights Hospitaller]] who ruled it. This, along with the historic [[Acts of the Apostles|Biblical]] shipwreck of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] on the island, ingrained the strong [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] legacy which is still the official and most practiced [[religion in Malta]] today.

The country's official languages are [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[English language|English]], although there are strong historical ties to the [[Italian language]] on the islands. Malta gained [[independence]] from [[UK|Britain]] in 1964 and is currently a member of the [[European Union]] which it joined in 2004, in addition to being part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[UN]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the term "Malta" is uncertain, though the modern day variation is from the [[Maltese language]]. The more common [[etymology]] is that it comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word μέλι (''meli'') ('honey'). The Greeks called the island Μελίτη (''Melite'') meaning "[[honey]]" or "honey-sweet" possibly due to Malta's unique production of honey; Malta has had an [[Endemism|endemic]] species of bee which lives on the island, giving it the common nickname the "land of honey".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2003/06/29/l7.html|publisher=Malta Today|title=Controversy over unique Maltese bee population|date=[[February 6]] [[2008]]}}</ref> Not only was there Greek influence on the island as early as [[700 BCE]],<ref name="ndmh">{{cite news|url=http://www.doi.gov.mt/EN/islands/dates.asp|publisher=Department of Information - Maltese Government|title=Notable dates in Malta's history|date=[[February 6]] [[2008]]}}</ref> but the island was later dominated by the Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]] from 395 to 870.<ref name="ndmh" /> Another etymology given is the [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] word ''Maleth'' meaning "a haven,"<ref>{{cite book |last=Pickles |first=Tim | title = Malta 1565: Last Battle of the Crusades |publisher=Osprey Publishing |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0LuvbRQ78sIC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=Maleth+Malta+haven&source=web&ots=PGO2OF9Y9I&sig=rcodiMbexlDy5YwMXhelH7zEYyw |isbn=978-1855326033}}</ref> in reference to Malta's many bays and coves.

For a brief period the kingdom passed onto the [[Capetian House of Anjou]], however high taxes made the dynasty unpopular in Malta, due to [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]]'s war against the [[Republic of Genoa]] the island of Gozo was sacked in 1275.<ref name="malticross">{{cite book  | last = Castillo| first = Dennis Angelo | title =The Maltese Cross: A Strategic History of Malta| publisher =Greenwood Publishing Group| url =http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i5ns5LNtoiUC&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=MALTA+sEMPRONIUS&source=web&ots=JHcfabryVa&sig=cXCtKu3apl5Y2y7OEhaMvt1CMM0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA25,M1|isbn=0313323291}}</ref>
Following this there was a large revolt on Sicily known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]], this saw the Peninsula part of the kingdom separating into the [[Kingdom of Naples]]; the Kingdom of Sicily including Malta instead fell under the rule of the [[House of Barcelona|Aragonese]].<ref name = "knowital"/> The kingdom was ruled by relatives of the [[kings of Aragon]] until 1409 and then as part of the [[Crown of Aragon]].<ref name="knowital">{{cite news|url=http://www.knowital.com/history/sicily/sicily-history.html|publisher=KnowItal.com|title=History of Sicily|date=[[7 October]] [[2007]]}}</ref> Early on in the Aragonese reign, the Count of Malta title was given to sons of the monarchy; it was also during this time that much of the [[Maltese nobility]] sprung up.

===Knights of Malta and Napoleon===
[[Image:Mdinakathedraal.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina]] designed in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style.]]
In 1530 [[Charles I of Spain]] gave the islands to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem]] in perpetual lease. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had owned the islands as part of its Mediterranean empire for some time. These knights, a military religious order now known as the "[[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]", had been driven out of [[Rhodes]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1522. They withstood a full-blown [[Siege of Malta (1565)|siege by the Ottoman Turks]] in 1565, at the time the greatest naval power in the Mediterranean sea. After this they decided to increase the [[fortification]]s, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of [[Valletta]], named after [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Jean Parisot de la Valette|Jean de la Valette]], was built.

Their reign ended when Malta was captured by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] en route to his expedition of [[Egypt]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1798. As a ruse, Napoleon asked for safe harbour to resupply his ships, and then turned his guns against his hosts once safely inside Valletta. [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]] capitulated, and Napoleon stayed in Malta for a few days, during which time he systematically looted the movable assets of the Order, and established an administration controlled by his nominees. He then sailed for Egypt, leaving a substantial garrison in Malta.

The occupying French forces were unpopular, however, due particularly to their negative attitude towards religion. Their financial and religious reforms did not go down well with the citizens. The Maltese rebelled against them, and the French were forced behind the fortifications.

Great Britain, along with the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], sent ammunition and aid to the rebels, and Britain also sent [[Royal Navy|her navy]], which instigated a blockade of the islands. The isolated French forces, under General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]], surrendered in 1800, and the island became a British [[Dominion]], being presented by several Maltese leaders to Sir [[Alexander Ball]].

===British rule and World War II===
{{main|Siege of Malta (World War II)}}
[[Image:BombDamageMalta.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A heavily bomb-damaged street in [[Valletta]] during the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Siege of Malta]], 1942.]]
In 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], Malta officially became a part of the [[British Empire]], and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters. Malta's position half-way between [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Suez Canal]] proved to be its main asset during these years, and it was considered to be an important stop on the way to [[India]].

In the early 1930s, the British [[Mediterranean Fleet (Royal Navy)|Mediterranean Fleet]], which was at the time the main contributor for the commerce on the island, was moved to [[Alexandria]] as an economic measure. Malta played an important role during [[World War II]], owing to its proximity to [[Axis Powers|Axis]] shipping lanes. The bravery of the Maltese people in their long struggle against [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|enemy attack]] moved [[George VI of the United Kingdom|HM King George VI]] to award the [[George Cross (Malta)|George Cross]] to Malta on a collective basis on [[April 15]] [[1942]] "to bear witness to a heroism and devotion that will long be famous in history". Some historians argue that the award caused Britain to incur disproportionate losses in defending Malta, as British credibility would have suffered if Malta was surrendered, as [[Singapore]] had been.<ref> {{cite web | title=The Siege of Malta in World War Two |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/siege_malta_06.shtml | accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref> A replica of the George Cross now appears in the upper hoist corner of the [[Flag of Malta]]. The collective award remained unique until April 1999, when the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] became the second{{ndash}} and, to date, the only other{{ndash}} recipient of the collective George Cross.

===Independence===
After the war, and after the [[Malta Labour Party]]'s unsuccessful attempt at [[History of Malta#Attempted integration with the United Kingdom|"Integration with Britain"]], Malta was granted independence on September 21, 1964 ([[Independence Day (Malta)|Independence Day]]). Under its 1964 [[constitution]], Malta initially retained Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Malta]], with a [[Governor-General]] exercising [[executive (government)|executive]] authority on her behalf. On December 13, 1974 ([[Republic Day (Malta)|Republic Day]]) it became a [[republic]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with the [[President of Malta|President]] as [[head of state]]. A defence agreement signed soon after independence (and re-negotiated in 1972) expired on March 31, 1979 ([[Freedom Day (Malta)|Freedom Day]]) when the British military forces were withdrawn. Malta adopted an official policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in 1980 and for a brief period was a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Movement of Non-Aligned Countries]]. In 1989 Malta was the venue of an important [[Malta Summit|summit]] between US President [[George H.W. Bush|Bush]] and Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], their first face-to-face encounter, which signaled the end of the [[Cold War]].

Malta joined the [[European Union]] on May 1, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm|title=The History of the European Union - 2000-today|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> Following the European Council of 21 June to 22 June 2007 it joined the [[Eurozone]] on January 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/euro/cyprus-malta-set-join-eurozone-2008/article-163836|title=Cyprus and Malta set to join eurozone in 2008|date=16 May 2007|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>

== Politics and government==
[[Image:Edward Fenech Adami.jpg|thumb|220px|Dr. [[Eddie Fenech Adami]] has been the President of Malta since 2004.]]
{{main|Politics of Malta|Government of Malta}}
Malta is a [[republic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-malta.com/law/constitution-1.htm|title=Chapter 1 / The Republic of Malta / Maltese Constitution|work=Constitution of Malta Act, 1964|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> whose [[parliamentary system]] and [[public administration]] is closely modeled on the [[Westminster system]]. The [[unicameral]] [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]], (Maltese: ''Il-Kamra tar-Rappreżentanti''), is elected by direct universal suffrage through [[single transferable vote]] every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the [[President of Malta|President]] on advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malta|Prime Minister]]. The House of Representatives is made up of sixty-five [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]]. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The [[Constitution of Malta]] provides that the President appoint as Prime Minister the member of the House who is best able to command a (governing) majority in the House.

The [[President of Malta|President of the Republic]] is elected every five years by the House of Representatives. The role of the president as head of state is largely ceremonial. The main political parties are the [[Partit Nazzjonalista|Nationalist Party]], which is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party, and the [[Malta Labour Party]], with [[Joseph Muscat|Dr. Joseph Muscat]] as its leader, which is a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party. The Nationalist Party is currently (2008) at the helm of the government, the Prime Minister being [[Lawrence Gonzi|Dr. Lawrence Gonzi]]. The Malta Labour Party is in opposition. There are a number of smaller political parties in Malta that presently have no parliamentary representation.

Until [[World War II]] Maltese politics was dominated by the [[Languages of Malta|language question]] fought out by [[Pro-Italian Maltese|pro-Italian]] and [[Pro-British Maltese|pro-British]] parties<ref>[http://www.maltavoyager.com/history_independence.html Maltavoyager.com - History - The Independence<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.maltavoyager.com</ref>. Post-War politics dealt with constitutional questions on the relations with Britain (first with [[History of Malta#Attempted integration with the United Kingdom|Integration]] then [[History of Malta#Independence (Indipendenza)|Independence]]) and, eventually, relations with the [[History of Malta#EU membership (L-Unjoni Ewropea)|European Union]].

{{main|Geography of Malta}}
Malta is an [[archipelago]] in the central [[Mediterranean Sea]] (in its eastern basin), some 93&nbsp;km south of the [[Italy|Italian]] island of [[Sicily]] across the Malta Channel; east of [[Tunisia]] and north of [[Libya]] in [[Africa]]. Only the three largest islands [[Malta Island]] (Malta), [[Gozo]] (Għawdex), and [[Comino]] (Kemmuna) are inhabited. The smaller islands, such as [[Filfla]], [[Cominotto]] and the [[Islands of St. Paul]] are uninhabited. Numerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide good harbours. The archipelago itself lies on the edge of the African tectonic plate, as it borders with the Eurasian plate. The landscape is characterised by low hills with terraced fields. The highest point is at [[Ta' Dmejrek]] on Malta Island at 253 metres (830&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) near [[Dingli]]. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta. However, some watercourses are found around the island that have fresh water running all year round. Such places are Baħrija, l-Intaħleb and San Martin. Running water in Gozo is found at Lunzjata Valley.

Malta implemented the [[Schengen Agreement]] on December 21, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/snapshot2007/travel/travel_en.htm|title=Europe and you in 2007, Passport-free travel extended|author=European Commission|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> Customs and border controls remained at airports until March 2008.

[[Image:Comino02.jpg|thumb|450px|right|The island of [[Comino]]]]
Contrary to popular belief, the south of Malta is not [[Extreme points of Europe|Europe's most southern point]]; that distinction belongs to the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Gavdos]].

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Malta belongs to the Liguro-Tyrrhenian province of the [[Mediterranean Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Malta belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of [[Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests]].

===Islands===
The main islands, and the only two inhabited ones, of the country are [[Malta (island)|Malta Island]] and [[Gozo]]. Other islands that form part of the [[archipelago]] include: [[Comino]] (''Kemmuna''), [[Cominotto]] (''Kemmunett'', uninhabited), [[Filfla]] (uninhabited), [[Fungus Rock]] (''Il-Ġebla tal-Ġeneral'', uninhabited), [[Manoel Island]] (which is joined to the town of [[Gżira]], on the mainland by a bridge), and the [[Islands of St. Paul]] (uninhabited). The Maltese Islands have been an independent [[republic]] since 1974.  The centre of government, commerce and [[Culture Malta|culture]] is the capital city of [[Valletta]], on the eastern coast of [[Malta]].

Maltese Islands are as the following:

* [[Barbaganni Rock]]
* [[Comino]]
* [[Cominotto]]
* [[Delmarva Island]]
* [[Filfla]]
* [[Fessej Rock]]
* [[Fungus Rock]]
* [[Għallis Rock]] 
* [[Gozo]]
* [[Halfa Rock]]
* [[Large Blue Lagoon Rocks]]
* [[Islands of St. Paul]]/Selmunett Island
* [[Malta (island)|Malta Island]]
* [[Manoel Island]]
* [[Mistra Rocks]]
* [[Tac-Cawl Rock]]
* [[Qawra Point]]/Ta`Fraben Island
* [[Small Blue Lagoon Rocks]]
* [[Sala Rock]]
* [[Xrob l-Għaġin Rock]]

===Climate===
The climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Csa), with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. There is no real thermal dormant season for plants, although plant growth can be checked briefly by abnormal cold in winter (patches of ground frost may occur in inland locales), and summer heat and aridity may cause vegetation to wilt. Effectively there are only two seasons, which makes the islands attractive for tourists, especially during the drier months. However, strong winds can make Malta feel cold during the springtime.

Water supply poses a problem on Malta, as the summer is both rainless and the time of greatest water use, and the winter rainfall often falls as heavy showers running off to the sea rather than soaking into the ground. Malta depends on underground reserves of fresh water, drawn through a system of water tunnels called the Ta' Kandja galleries, which average about 97&nbsp;m. below surface and extend like the spokes of a wheel. In the galleries in Malta's porous limestone, fresh water lies in a lens upon brine. More than half the potable water of Malta is produced by [[desalination]], which creates further issues of fossil fuel use and pollution.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6525069.stm BBC News "Briney future for vulnerable Malta"] 4 April 2007</ref>

In January 2007 [[International Living]] chose Malta as the country with the best climate in the world.<ref> [http://www.internationalliving.com/countries/malta/country_archive/01_25_07_worlds_best World's Best Climate] </ref>

The lowest temperature ever recorded at Valletta was on February 19, 1895, with {{C to F |num=+1.2 |precision=1 }}, and the highest temperature was {{C to F |num=+43.8 |precision=1 }} recorded in August 1999 at Luqa International Airport.
An unofficial lowest temperature of {{C to F |num=-1.7 |precision=1 }} was recorded on February 1, 1962 in the [[Ta' Qali]] airfield with snow on the ground.
Snow is virtually unheard of, with very few and brief snow flurries recorded in February 1895, January 1905 and January 31st, 1962. No accumulation has been reported on the coast at least since 1800, but on the last day of January 1962 snow briefly covered some parts of the interior of the main island. The following night the only frost in the history of Malta was recorded in the [[Ta' Qali]] airfield.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Malta}}
[[Image:Valletta-Harbour.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Grand Harbour]]]]
Until 1800 Malta had very few industries except the [[cotton]], [[tobacco]] and shipyards industry. The [[dockyard]] was later used by the British for military purposes. At times of war Malta's economy prospered due to its strategic location. This could be seen during the [[Crimean war|Crimean War]] of 1854. This benefited those who had a military role, as well as the craftsmen.

In 1869 the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] benefited Malta's economy greatly, as there was a massive increase in the shipping which entered the port. [[Entrepôt]] trade saw many ships stopping at Malta's docks for refuelling, which brought great benefits to the population. Towards the end of the 19th century the economy began declining, and by the 1940s Malta's economy was in serious crisis. This was partially due to the longer range of newer merchant ships which required less frequent refuelling stops.

Presently, Malta’s major resources are [[limestone]], a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies and has no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles) and tourism. Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of good-quality hotels are present on the island. An increasing number of Maltese now travel abroad on holiday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=57309|title=More Maltese travel abroad|work=The Malta Independent|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> Although they are still a net importer of tourism, the ratio of inbound tourists to outbound tourists is decreasing. [[Films shot in Malta|Film production]] is a growing contributor to the Maltese economy, with several big-budget foreign films shooting in Malta each year. The country has increased the exports of many other types of services such as banking and finance.

The government is investing heavily in the country's provision of education. As all education is free, Malta is currently producing a pool of qualified persons which heavily contribute to the country's growing economy.

Malta has recently [[privatization|privatised]] some state-controlled firms and liberalised markets in order to prepare for membership in the [[European Union]], which it joined on May 1, 2004. For example, the government announced on January 8, 2007 that it is selling its 40% stake in [[Maltapost]], in order to complete a privatisation process which has been ongoing for the past five years. Malta and [[Tunisia]] are currently discussing the commercial exploitation of the continental shelf between their countries, particularly for petroleum exploration.

The Maltese government entered [[ERM II]] on May 4, 2005, and adopted the [[euro]] as the country's currency on January 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6288084.stm|title=Cyprus and Malta to adopt euros|date=10 July 2007|work=BBC News Business|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> [[Maltese euro coins]] feature the [[Maltese Cross]] on €2 and €1 coins, the [[Coat of Arms of Malta|Maltese Coat of Arms]] on the €0.50, €0.20 and €0.10 coins, and the [[Mnajdra]] Temples on the €0.05, €0.02 and €0.01 coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymalta.com/wt/2006/06/maltese-cross-on-euro-coins.shtml|title= Maltese Cross on the Euro coins|work=Malta Media|date=June 12, 2006|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>

{{main|Maltese euro coins}}
{{main|Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Malta)}}

In Malta the [[euro]] was introduced in 2008. Three different designs were selected for the Maltese coins. In this short period, Malta also produced collectors' coins, with face value ranging from 10 to 50 euro.  These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting of silver and gold commemorative coins.  Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a €10 Maltese commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

== Military ==
{{main|Armed Forces of Malta}}
The objectives of the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) are to maintain a military organisation with the primary aim of defending the Islands' integrity according to the defence roles as set by Government in an efficient and cost effective manner. This is achieved by emphasising the maintenance of Malta's territorial waters and airspace integrity.

The AFM also engages in combating terrorism, fighting against illicit drug trafficking, conducting anti-illegal immigrant and anti-illegal fishing operations, operating Search and Rescue (SAR) services, and physical/electronic security/surveillance of sensitive locations. Malta's Search and Rescue area extends from east of Tunisia to west of Crete covering an area of around 250,000 km².

As a military organisation, the AFM provides backup support to the [[Malta Police Force]] (MPF) and other government departments/agencies in situations as required in an organised, disciplined manner in the event of national emergencies (such as natural disasters) or internal security and bomb disposal.

On another level, the AFM establishes and/or consolidates [[bilateralism|bilateral co-operation]] with other countries to reach higher operational effectiveness related to AFM roles.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Malta}}

===Population===
A census of population and housing is held every ten years. The last census was held over three weeks in November 2005 and managed to enumerate an estimated 96% of the population. A preliminary report was issued in April 2006, and results were weighted to an estimate for 100% of the population.

Native [[Maltese people]] make up the majority of the island. However there are minorities, the largest of which are [[British people]], many of whom retired to Malta.

<!--Note to Editors: All information, INCLUDING COMMENTARY, is from 2005 census except where indicated. Location for verification and for updating on next year's demographic review are commented.-->The resident population of Malta, which includes foreigners residing in Malta for at least a year, as of November 27, 2005 was estimated at 404,039 of whom 200,715 (49.7%) were males and 203,324 (50.3%) were females<!--Table 2: Population and sex ratio: 1842-2005-->. Of these, 17.1 per cent were aged 14 and under, 68.2 per cent were within the 15–64 age bracket whilst the remaining 13.7 per cent were 65 years and over<!--Table 8: Total population by broad age group and locality as at 27 November 2005-->. Malta's [[population density]] of 1,282 per [[square kilometer]] (3,322/[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) <!--Table 6: Population density: 1995-2005-->is by far the highest in the EU<!--Table 15: Population density in Europe-->, and one of the [[List of countries by population density|highest]] in the world. The only census year showing a fall in population was that of 1967, with a 1.7% total decrease, attributable to a substantial number of Maltese residents who emigrated.<ref name="Census2005">{{cite book |authorlink=http://www.nso.gov.mt |title=Census of Population and Housing 2005: Preliminary Report |publisher=National Statistics Office |year=2005 |location=Valletta |url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=1653 |id=ISBN-13 978-99909-73-38-9}}</ref> The Maltese-resident population for 2004 was estimated to make up 97.0% of the total resident population.<ref name="Demo2004"/>

Through all the censuses since 1842 there was always a slightly higher female-to-male ratio. Closest to reaching equality were 1901 and 1911 censuses<!-- (1000:1000 and 1003:1000 respectively)-->. The highest female-to-male ratio was reached in 1957 (1088:1000), and since the ratio has been constantly dropping. The 2005 census showed a 1013:1000 female-to-male ratio<!--Table 2: Population and sex ratio: 1842-2005-->.

Population growth has slowed down, from +9.5% between the 1985 and 1995 censuses, to +6.9% between the 1995 and 2005 censuses (a yearly average of +0.7%)<!--Commentary p. xvii & Chart 3: Percentage population change between censuses-->. The birth rate stood at 3860 (a decrease of 21.8% from the 1995 census) and the death rate stood at 3025. Thus, there was a natural population increase of 835 (compared to +888 for 2004, of which over a hundred were foreign residents).<ref name="NSO 20060711">{{cite press release |title=World Population Day - 2006: Special Observances |publisher=National Statistics Office |location=Valletta |date=10 July 2006 |url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=1719 |accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref>

<!--May be used in any future section on the pension problem-->The population's age composition is similar to the age structure prevalent in the EU<!--Chart 11. Comparative distribution bet Malta and EU25-->. Since 1967 there was observed a trend indicating an aging population, and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Malta's [[Dependency ratio|old-age-dependency-ratio]] rose from 17.2% in 1995 to 19.8% in 2005, reasonably lower than the EU's 24.9% average. In fact, 31.5% of the Maltese population is aged under 25 (compared to the EU's 29.1%); but the 50-64 age group constitutes 20.3% of the population, significantly higher than the EU's 17.9%. In conclusion, Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio is expected to continue rising steadily in the coming years<!--Commentary p.xxvii-->.

Maltese legislation recognizes both civil and canonical (ecclesiastical) [[marriage]]s. Annulments by the Ecclesiastes and civil courts are unrelated and are not necessarily granted. There is no [[divorce]] legislation and [[abortion]] in Malta is illegal. A person must be 18 to marry.<ref>[http://www.weddingvendors.com/marriage-license-laws/united-states/montana/ Montana Marriage License Information, Laws, Requirements<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.weddingvendors.com</ref> The number of brides aged under 25 decreased from 1471 in 1997 to 766 in 2005; while the number of grooms under 25 decreased from 823 to 311. There is a constant trend that females are more likely than males to marry young. In 2005 there were 51 brides aged between 16 and 19, compared to 8 grooms.<ref name="NSO 20060711"/>

At the end of 2007, The population of the Maltese Islands stood at 410,290 and is expected to reach 424,028 by 2025. At the moment, females slightly outnumber males, making up 50.3 per cent of the population. The largest proportion of persons{{ndash}} 7.5 per cent{{ndash}} were aged 25-29, while there were 7.3 per cent falling into each of the 45-49 and 55-59 age brackets.<ref>[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080712/local/population-in-malta-gozo-exceeds-410-000 Timesofmalta.com - Population in Malta, Gozo exceeds 410,000<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.timesofmalta.com</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of Malta}}
The official languages of Malta are [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[English language|English]], both of which are spoken by the population. Maltese, which is constitutionally the [[national language]], is [[language family|genetically]] a [[Semitic language]], descended from [[Sicilian Arabic]] Still popular in Malta, even though English is dominating the country right now.(from [[southern Italy]]), with [[relexification|substantial borrowing]] from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], a little [[French language|French]], and more recently, and increasingly, [[English language|English]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/grazio/study2.html|title=Evolution of the Maltese Language}}</ref>

The Maltese language(Il-Malti) is the mother tongue language of the Maltese people.

The [[Maltese alphabet]] consists of 30 letters based on the [[Latin alphabet]], but uses the [[diacritic]]ally altered letter ''[[ż]]'' (found in [[Polish language|Polish]]), ''[[ċ]]'' and ''[[ġ]]'' (comparable to [[Esperanto]] ''[[ĉ]]'' and ''[[ĝ]]''), as well as the letters ''[[għ]]'', ''[[ħ]]'', and ''[[Ie (digraph)|ie]]'', which are unique to Maltese.

[[Italian language|Italian]] was the official language of Malta until 1934, when it was replaced by English and Maltese, thus ending the Language Question. The language still maintains strong ties to the country, and is spoken by the majority of the population as a [[second language]] today. Italian television channels from Italy-based broadcasters, such as [[Mediaset]] and [[RAI]], reach Malta and remain popular.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1045691.stm Country profile: Malta] BBC News; [[2008-01-10]]; [[2008-02-21]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_237.en.pdf |title=Europeans and languages |accessdate=2007-01-29 |year=2005 |month=September |format=PDF |publisher=European Commission |pages=p.4}}</ref><ref name=LinguisticView>Ignasi Badia i Capdevila; [http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/noves/hm04primavera-estiu/a_badia2_3.htm A view of the linguistic situation in Malta]; NovesSl; 2004; retrieved on [[2008-02-24]]</ref>

The [[Eurobarometer]] states that 100% of the population speaks Maltese, 88% speaks English, 66% speaks Italian, and 17% speaks French,<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf</ref> rendering the country one of the most pan-linguistically fluent in the [[European Union]]. However, public opinion on what language they "preferred" to use was different, with 86% of the population having preference for Maltese, 12% for English, and 2% Italian.<ref name=LinguisticView/>

===Religion===
[[Image:Domen i Mosta.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Mosta Dome]] known as "Ir-Rotunda"]]
{{main|Religion in Malta}} 
The Constitution of Malta provides for freedom of religion but establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion. Freedom House and the World Factbook report that 98 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, making the nation one of the most Catholic countries in the world

The patron saints are [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], Saint Agata and Saint George. Although not declared officially as a patron saint, St.George Preca (San Gorg Preca) is greatly revered as the first canonised Maltese saint. He was canonised in 3 June 2007 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. A number of Maltese individuals are recognised as [[Blessed]], including [[Maria Adeodata Pisani]] and [[Nazju Falzon]], these having been beatified by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2001.

Various [[Roman Catholic]] religious orders are found in Malta, such as the [[Jesuits]], [[Franciscans]], [[Dominicans]] and [[Little Sisters of the Poor]].

Most congregants at the local [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches are not Maltese; many British retirees live in the country, and vacationers from many other nations compose the remainder of such congregations. There are approximately 500 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), the [[Bible Baptist Church]], and the [[Fellowship of Evangelical Churches]] have about 60 affiliates. There is one [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregation. [[Zen Buddhism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] also have about 40 members. There is one [[Muslim]] mosque and a Muslim primary school. Of the estimated 3,000 Muslims in Malta, approximately 2,250 are foreigners, approximately 600 are naturalized citizens, and approximately 150 are native-born Maltese.<ref>{{cite web

There are also some churches of other denominations, such as [[St. Andrew's Scots Church, Malta|St. Andrew's Scots Church]] in Valletta (a joint [[Presbyterian]] and [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist]] congregation) and [[St Paul's Anglican Cathedral]], as well as a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] church in [[Birkirkara]].

===Migration===
EU nationals require neither a [[visa (document)|visa]] nor a passport (an ID card or an expired passport are enough) to enter the country. Citizens of a number of third countries are not required to apply for a visa and require only a valid passport when residing in Malta for up to three months. Visas for other nationalities are valid for one month.

Immigrants, even those with EU citizenship, are required to apply for a work permit. This exception to EU law was agreed upon before accession to safeguard the Maltese [[labour economics|labour market]]. 

<!--Add statistics on legal immigration and emigration-->The estimated net inflow (using data for 2002 to 2004) was of 1,913 persons yearly. Over the last 10 years, Malta accepted back a yearly average of 425 returning emigrants.<ref name="Demo2004">{{cite book |last=National Statistics Office|title=Demographic Review 2004 |publisher=National Statistics Office |year=2005 |location=Valletta |url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=1542 |isbn=99909-73-32-6 |page=59}}</ref>

During 2006, a total of 1,800 illegal immigrants reached Malta making the boat crossing from the North Africa coast. Most of them intended to reach mainland Europe and happened to come to Malta by mistake.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Frendo holds talks with three European Union Commission Members |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |location=Valletta |date=30 January 2006 |url=http://www.foreign.gov.mt/showdoc.aspx?id=210&filesource=4&file=Press%20release%20EU%20Commissioners%20300106.pdf |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4365030.stm|title=Immigrant frustration for Malta|date=21 October 2005|accessdate=2007-10-12|work=BBC News Europe}}</ref> In the first half of 2006, 967 irregular immigrants arrived in Malta{{ndash}} almost double the 473 who arrived in the same period in 2005.<ref name="Frendo03072006">{{cite press release |title=Statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Michael Frendo to resident EU Ambassadors on irregular immigration in Malta |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |location=Valletta |date=3 July 2006 |url=http://www.foreign.gov.mt/showdoc.aspx?id=210&filesource=4&file=Illegal%20Immigration%20-%20Statement%20for%20EU%20Ambassadors%20030706.pdf |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> Many immigrants have perished in the journey across the Mediterranean, with one notable incident being the [[May 2007 Malta migrant boat disaster]].

Around 45% of immigrants landed in Malta have been granted [[refugee]] (5%) or protected humanitarian status (40%). A [[White Paper]] suggesting the grant of Maltese citizenship to refugees resident in Malta for over ten years was issued in 2005. Historically Malta gave refuge (and assisted in their resettlement) to eight hundred or so East African Asians who had been expelled from [[Uganda]] by [[Idi Amin]] and to just under a thousand [[Iraq]]is fleeing [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime.

Detention costs for the first half of 2006 alone cost € 746,385.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=The Sunday Times |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/core/article.php?id=230879 |title=Immigrants refused entry into Malta |date=16 July 2006 |accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref>

In 2005, Malta sought EU aid in relation to reception of irregular immigrants, repatriation of those denied refugee status, resettlement of refugees into EU countries, and maritime security.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Michael |last=Frendo |title=Illegal Immigration in Malta |booktitle=EU Foreign Ministers Council |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=5 July 2005 |url=http://www.foreign.gov.mt/showdoc.aspx?id=96&filesource=4&file=ILLEGal%20Immigrants.pdf |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> In December 2005, the European Council adopted ''The Global Approach to Migration: Priority Actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean''; but the deployment of said actions has been limited to the western Mediterranean, thus putting further pressure on the central Mediterranean route for irregular immigration of which Malta forms a part.

== Education ==
Primary schooling has been compulsory since 1946, and secondary education was made compulsory in 1971 up to the age of sixteen. Education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16 years. While the state provides education free of charge, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and the private sector run a number of schools in Malta and [[Gozo]], such as [[St. Aloysius' College]] in [[Birkirkara]]. Most of the teachers' salary in Church schools is paid by the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/grazio/education.html|title=Education in Malta|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>

Education in Malta is based on the [[Education in the United Kingdom|British Model]]. Primary School lasts six years. At age 11 students sit for an examination to enter a Secondary School, either a Church School (the Common Entrance Examination) or a State School. Students sit for SEC [[O-level]] examinations at age 16, with passes obligatory in certain subjects such as Mathematics, English and Maltese. Students may opt to continue studying at a Sixth Form college like Junior College, Saint Aloysius' and De La Salle or else at another post-secondary institution such as [[MCAST]]. The Sixth Form course lasts for two years, at the end of which students sit for the Matriculation examination. Subject to their performance, students may then apply for an undergraduate degree or diploma.

Tertiary education at diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate level is mainly provided by the [[University of Malta]] (UoM).

The adult [[literacy rate]] is 92.8%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mt.html#People|title=CIA Factbook|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>

<!-- This section is linked to from the "Languages" section above. If changing the section title, update the link as well. -->
===Languages in education===
<!-- The education system in Malta puts less emphasis on the [[Maltese language]] than other areas of the government do. -->
English and Maltese are both used to teach students at primary and secondary school level, and both languages are also compulsory subjects. Public schools tend to use both Maltese and English in a balanced manner. Private schools prefer to use English for teaching, as is also the case with most departments of the [[University of Malta]]; this has a limiting effect on the capacity and development of the Maltese language.<ref name=LinguisticView/> Most university courses are in English.<ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/MED-magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm MED Magazine<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.macmillandictionary.com</ref>

Of the total number of students studying a first foreign language at secondary level, 51% take Italian whilst 38% take French. Other choices include German, Russian, Spanish, and Arabic.<ref>[http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=580 Foreign Language Learning]; National Statistics Office - Malta; [[2004-09-01]]; retrieved on [[2008-02-25]]</ref><ref name=LinguisticView/>

==Healthcare==
Malta has a long history of healthcare, and the first hospital recorded in the country was already functioning by 1372.[http://www.geocities.com/hotsprings/2615/medhist/hospital2.htm]

Modern-day Malta has both a public healthcare system, known as the government healthcare service, and a private healthcare system. [http://www.sahha.gov.mt/pages.aspx?page=156][http://www.gov.mt/servicecluster.asp?s=4&l=2]

Malta was ranked number 5 in the [[World Health Organization]]'s ranking of the world's health systems,[http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html] well above the [[United States]] (at 37), [[Australia]] (at 32), and [[Canada]] (at 30). The [[United Kingdom]], the best of this group of larger comparator countries, was ranked at number 18, which is interesting in that the healthcare system in Malta closely resembles the British system, [http://www.stphilips.com.mt/StPhilips/hospital.asp] as healthcare is free at the point of delivery. Also, like the UK Malta has a strong general practitioner-delivered primary care base, supplemented by secondary care and tertiary care provided by a number of public hospitals, some of which (such as [[St. Luke's Hospital, Malta|St. Luke's Hospital]]) are large (see [[List of hospitals in Malta]]).

There is both a [[medical school]] and a [[dental school]] at the [[University of Malta]], as well as a [[nursing school]] [http://www.um.edu.mt/courses/bsc_nursing.pdf].

Malta has three major private hospitals. These are [[St Philip's Hospital]], with a capacity of 75 beds, in Santa Venera, and [[St James Capua Hospital]] in Sliema, with 80 beds (the former Capua Palace Hospital) - St James Hospital also has other sites, including a 13 bed unit in Zabbar, as well as a partner hospital in [[Libya]]. There is also St Mark's Clinic, with a capacity of 5 beds, based in Msida and which offers private hospital services.

In recent years, Malta has been trying to develop as a [[medical tourism]] destination [http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=61027]. However, up to 2008 no Maltese hospitals in either the public or the private sectors had undergone independent [[international healthcare accreditation]]. Malta is popular with British medical tourists [http://www.treatmentabroad.net/medical-tourism/news/november-2007/malta-popular-with-uk-medical-tourists][http://ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/News_MoreInfo.asp?Articleid=18342883&titleID=Malta+'popular+with+UK+medical+tourists'+(05.11.07)], and logically this may point Maltese hospitals towards seeking UK-sourced accreditation, such as with the [[Trent Accreditation Scheme]], or possibly to seek dual accreditation with the American-orientated [[Joint Commission]] if they wish to compete with the Far East and Latin America for medical tourists from the [[United States]], as well as from the [[UK]]. A number of [[health tourism provider]]s are involved in developing [[medical tourism]] in Malta.

The Maltese Ministry of Health advises foreign residents to take out private medical insurance. [http://www.alloexpat.com/moving_to_malta_forum/healthcare-in-malta-t162.html]

The [[Medical Association of Malta]] represents practitioners of the medical profession. [[MMSA]] is a separate body representing Maltese medical students, and is a member of [[EMSA]] and [[IFMSA]]. [[MIME]], the Maltese Institute for Medical Education, is an institute set up recently to provide CME to doctors in Malta as well as medical students. [[MADS]], the Malta Association of Dental Students, is a student association set up to promote the rights of Dental Surgery Students studying within the faculty of Dental Surgery of the University of Malta. It is affiliated with [[IADS]], the International Association of Dental Students.

==Architecture==
[[Image:Ggantija Temples.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Ġgantija]], the ancient temples built by the first settlers from Sicily]]
[[Image:Tignepoint.JPG|thumb|150px|left|The development at [[Tigne Point]] is expected to be complete around 2012]]
Malta has a long history of architecture, influenced by many different mediterranean cultures over its history, and most recently, British architecture. The first settlers on the island constructed [[Ġgantija]], the oldest manmade freestanding structure in the world.
Malta is currently undergoing a large scale mass building project, which include constructions such as [[SmartCity Malta]], the [[M-Towers]], and [[Pendergardens]], while areas like the [[Valletta Waterfront]] and [[Tigne Point]] are being rerenovated.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Malta}}
The culture of Malta is a reflection of various cultures that have come into contact with the [[Maltese Islands]] throughout the centuries, including neighbouring [[Mediterranean]] cultures, and the cultures of the nations that ruled Malta for long periods of time prior to its [[History of Malta#Independence|independence]] in 1964.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Maltese cuisine}}
[[Image:QaghaqtalGhasel.jpg|thumb|right|Qagħaq ta' l-Għasel]]
Maltese cuisine is the result of a long relationship between the [[Maltese people|Islanders]] and the many foreigners who dominated Malta over the centuries. This marriage of tastes has given Malta a disctinctive cuisine that is decidedly [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean in character]]. While many dishes are native to the island, some popular Maltese recipes show  [[Sicilian cuisine|Sicilian]], [[Italian cuisine|Southern Italian]] or [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] culinary influences. Popular local dishes include ''ftira biż-żejt'', ''ġbejniet'', ''pastizzi'' and ''Ross il-Forn''

{{further|[[List of radio stations in Malta|Radio stations in Malta]]}}
There is not as great a presence of the [[institutions]] – [[Christian Church|church]], [[political parties]], [[trade unions]] - in the [[print media]] as in the broadcasting media; moreover they are absent from the ownership of the [[newspapers]] published in [[English language|English]]. Trade Unions are not represented in the broadcasting media, but are in the print media, and only the [[General Workers' Union (Malta)|General Workers Union]] owns a newspaper. The [[Malta Workers' Union|UHM]], the second biggest [[Trade Union|union]], has no newspaper, TV, or radio stations.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.ejc.net/media_landscape/article/malta/ Media Landscape - Malta - European Journalism Centre<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.ejc.net</ref>

==== Broadcasting ====

[[Image:Public Broadcasting Authority Emblem (Malta).jpg|thumbnail|right|Public Broadcasting Authority Emblem]]
There are 5 major nationwide television channels in Malta: [[TVM (Malta)|TVM]], [[One Television]], [[NET Television (Malta)|NET Television]], [[Smash Television]] and [[Family TV]] - currently transmitted by analogue terrestrial, free-to-air signals. The [[state]] and [[political parties]] subsidies most of the fundings of these television stations. The [[Public Broadcasting Services]] is the state-owned station and is a member of the [[EBU]]. [[Media Link Communications Ltd]] and [[One Productions Ltd]] are affiliated with the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] and [[Malta Labour Party]] respectively. [[Smash Communications Ltd]] is privately owned. [[Public Broadcasting Authority (Malta)|The Broadcasting Authority]] supervises all local broadcasting stations and ensures their compliance with [[legal]] and licence obligations as well as the preservation of due impartiality; in respect of matters of [[political]] or [[industrial]] controversy or relating to current public policy; while fairly apportioning broadcasting facilities and time between persons belong to different political parties.  The Broadcasting Authority ensures that local broadcasting services consist of public, private and community broadcasts that offer varied and comprehensive programming to cater for all interests and tastes.

The only commercial TV station attracts an audience of 2%. Cable, terrestrial and satellite reception are all available, though the cable service is the most diffused. Cable subscriptions reached almost 124,000 in February 2006 reaching about 80% of Maltese households, and a small but increasing number of households are owning satellite dishes to receive other European TV networks such as the [[BBC]] from [[Great Britain]] and [[RAI]] from [[Italy]].

==== Print ====
{{further|[[List of newspapers in Malta]]}}
The most widely read and financially the strongest [[newspapers]] are published by [[Allied Newspapers Ltd.]], mainly the [[The Times (Malta)|The Times]] (27%) and [[The Times (Malta)|The Sunday Times]] (51.6%). Due to [[bilingualism]] half of the [[newspapers]] are published in [[English language|English]] and the other half in [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The Sunday newspaper [[It-Torċa]] (The Torch) published by the Union Press, a subsidiary of the [[General Workers' Union (Malta)|GWU]], is the paper with the biggest circulation in the Maltese language. Its sister paper, [[L-Orizzont]], is the Maltese daily with biggest circulation. Newspapers are definitively losing out to [[radio]] and [[television]] (and [[radio]] is losing to [[television]]) as preferred source of [[news]]. There is a high number of daily or weekly newspapers, there is one paper for every 28,000&nbsp;people. [[Advertising]], [[sales]] and [[subsidies]] are the three main methods of financing [[newspapers]] and [[magazines]]. However, most of the papers and [[magazines]] tied to [[institutions]] are subsidised by the same [[institutions]], they depend on [[advertising]] or subsidies from their owners.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

===Music===
While Maltese music today is largely [[western music|western]], traditional Maltese music includes what is known as [[Għana (folk music)|għana]]. This consists of background [[folk guitar]] music, while a few people, generally men, take it in turns to argue a point in a [[singsong]] voice. The aim of the lyrics, which are improvised, are to create a friendly yet challenging atmosphere, and it takes a number of years of practice to be able to combine the required artistic qualities with the ability to [[debate]] effectively.

===Literature===
Maltese literature is more than 200 years old, although a love ballad unearthed relatively recently, testifies that literary activity in the local tongue, albeit very scarce, was already practiced in medieval times. Malta followed for a very long time the romantic literary tradition, reaching its height in the works of Dun Karm, a poet with a splendid command of his craft who was also a priest and who was eventually declared as National Poet. 

Writers like Ruzar Briffa and Karmenu Vassallo tried to estrange themselves from the rigid grip of formal themes and versification but it was in the late nineteen sixties that Maltese literature experienced its most radical transformation with poets, prose writers and dramatists launching themeselves on an exploratory direction with no precedents. Angst, an  identity crisis, protest, rebellion and social commitment informed the best literary and theatre pieces of the time. Names of significant poets that stand out from the last quarter of the 20th century include Mario Azzopardi, Victor Fenech, Oliver Friggieri, Joe Friggieri, Charles Flores, Daniel Massa, Maria Ganado, Lillian Sciberras and Akille Mizzi.  In prose, Frans Sammut, Paul P, Borg and Joe J. Camilleri led the avantguard while in theatre the names that matter include Francis Ebejer, Alfred Sant, Doreen Micallef and Oreste Calleja.  

The next generation of writers widened the tracks further, especially in prose. Guze' Stagno, Karl Schembri and Clare Azzopardi are young writers fast establishing themselves while in poetry, significant names include Adrian Grima, Immanuel Mifsud, Norbet Bugeja and Simone Inguanez.

In literary criticism, Peter Serracino Inglott, Oliver Friggieri and Charles Briffa introduced perceptive historical, philosophical and psycho-social implications of acute power.

===Sports===
Malta has its own national football stadium. It is generally noted that the population tends to be split half and half with regards to supporting Italy or England in sports games, due to the cultural affinities of the island.<ref>{{cite news

===Special activities===
Boċċi is the Maltese version of the Italian game of [[Bocce]], French [[Pétanque]] and British [[Bowls]]. Other than certain differences in rules and the ground on which the game is played, one of the most obvious differences between Maltese Boċċi and foreign equivalents is the shape of the bowls themselves which tend to be cylindrical rather than spherical in shape. Many small clubs (usually called "Bocci Klabbs" or "Klabbs tal-Bocci") can be found in many Maltese localities and are usually well-frequented (particularly by elderly men) and are quite active on the local and European level.

In the last decade the aviation sport of Microlight Flying has been introduced on the island by the Island Microlight Club<ref>[http://www.islandmicrolightclub.com Island Microlight Club Malta - spread your wings and fly!<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.islandmicrolightclub.com</ref>In under ten years there are a total number of twenty two microlight aircraft that operate out of the Malta International Airport.
