A '''[[ladder]] match''' is a type of [[professional wrestling match types|match used in professional wrestling]] that is most commonly used to describe a match where an item (usually a title belt) is hung above the ring, and the winner is the contestant who climbs a ladder and retrieves the item. The ladder itself inevitably becomes a key feature of the match. Specifically, the wrestlers will use the ladder as a weapon to strike the opponent(s), as a launching pad for acrobatic attacks, and frequently these matches include impressive falls from the top of the ladder.

As mentioned above, Ladder Matches typically end when the item suspended above the ring is retrieved. However if a weapon is placed there, the match may proceed to a second phase in which the weapon may be used by the wrestler who obtained it and the match ends when one wrestler is able to pin the other. In team matches, this privilege is typically extended to the other members of the team. There are two notable forms of this particular type of Ladder Match. The first is [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]'s "Stairway to Hell" match, in which the item hung above the ring was a roll of barbed wire(on other occasions a kendo stick). The second form took place in [[World Championship Wrestling]] in the late 1990s where the weapon hung above the ring was a stun-gun.

Ladder Matches are often used as a finale to storylines, and as such, it is more common to have symbolic briefcases (usually "containing" a contract for a future championship match) or championships belts hung above the ring rather than weapons.

Because of the relatively extreme flow of the match, ladder matches are often fought under [[hardcore wrestling|no disqualification]] rules, encouraging the use of ladders along with other weapons as opposed to the sole exception to the ban on foreign objects. As a result, some consider ladder matches in particular as [[Spot (professional wrestling)|spotfests]], where wrestlers continue to take death-defying bumps for the entertainment of the audience, without regard to their own health and safety. Similarly, ladder matches have been frowned upon by promoters because of the easy ability to injure their wrestlers as a result of errant stunts.

==Origins==
Contrary to common opinion, the first ever Ladder Match was not the [[WrestleMania X]] classic between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], nor was the Ladder Match even a product of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. The Ladder Match was invented by [[Philip Lafond|Dan Kroffat]] of the [[Stampede Wrestling]] organization out of Canada. In September of 1972, Kroffat fought [[Tor Kamata]] in the first Ladder Match, where the object above the ring was a bag of money. Kroffat won the match and tossed some of the money into the crowd.

In July of 1983, Stampede Wrestling held another Ladder Match where, again, the object was to retrieve a bag of money. This time, [[Bret Hart]] faced off against Bad News Allen (more commonly known as Bad News Brown). This match is noteworthy because Hart went on to join the WWF and suggested this type of match to promoter [[Vince McMahon]]. McMahon took Hart's suggestion and scheduled a Ladder Match between Hart and Shawn Michaels for the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]] on July 21, 1992. Less than two years later, the Ladder Match seemed like a perfect choice for the WrestleMania X contest between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels. Their match was of such high quality that the concept of the Ladder Match caught on and has been used very widely ever since.

==Other variations==
*'''[[King of the Mountain match]]''' - Used in TNA; essentially a ladder match in reverse, the winner (or "King of the Mountain", if you will) is the first person to attach the object specificed beforehand (usually a championship belt) to the wire above the ring.
*'''[[Money in the Bank ladder match]]''' - Used in WWE; this match sees 6 men compete in a ladder match for a suspended briefcase which holds a [[contract]] that entitles the holder to a [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] or [[WWE Championship]] match at any time in the subsequent calendar year up to, and including, the next WrestleMania.  The match was first held at [[WrestleMania 21]], and was held again at [[WrestleMania 22]] (it is now an annual staple of the event). The winners of the first two Money in the Bank matches were Edge (WrestleMania 21) and Rob Van Dam (WrestleMania 22).
*'''[[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match ]]''' - Variation of the ladder match where tables and chairs are also permitted (and their use is encouraged). Referred to at times simply as TLC matches.
