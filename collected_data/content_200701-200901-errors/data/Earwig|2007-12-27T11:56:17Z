'''Earwig''' is the common name given to the [[insect]] [[order (biology)|order]] '''Dermaptera''' characterized by membranous [[insect wing|wings]] folded underneath short leathery forewings (hence the literal name of the order—"skin wings"). The [[abdomen]] extends well beyond the wings, and frequently, though not always, ends in a pair of [[forceps]]-like [[cercus|cerci]]. With about 1,800 recorded species in 10 families, the order is relatively small among Insecta. Earwigs are, however, quite common globally. There is no evidence that they transmit disease or otherwise harm humans or other animals, despite their nickname ''pincher bug''.

'''Earwig''' may also be used as a verb to mean: "to fill the mind with [[prejudice]] by [[insinuation]]s" or "to attempt to influence by persistent confidential [[argument]] or talk".<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=earwig dictionary.com: ''earwig'']</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Image:Dermaptera_fg1.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Earwig from Australia compared to a [[Compact Flash|CF]] card—63&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]].]]

The name ''earwig'' comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''eare'' "ear" and ''wicga'' "insect".  It is related to the fanciful notion that earwigs burrow into the brains of humans through the ear and therein lay their eggs.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' on "Earwig".</ref> This belief, however, is false. Nevertheless, being exploratory and omnivorous, earwigs probably do crawl into the human ear; even if they are only looking for a humid crevice in which to hide, such behavior provides a memorable basis for the name.<ref>{{Citation

Earwigging - also known as eavesdropping - means to overhear another's conversation.
==Classification==
Four suborders within the Dermaptera have been established:

* '''[[Archidermaptera]]''': Has a fossil record extending into the [[Jurassic]], with fossils from that period. These have unsegmented cerci and tarsi with 4-5 segments.
* '''[[Forficulina]]''': The largest and most familiar group.  The cerci are unsegmented, and modified into large, forcep-like structures.
* '''[[Hemimerina]]''': Represented by one genus, ''[[Hemimerus]]'', with filiform segmented cerci and are wingless, blind and viviparous and ectoparasitic on African rodents
* '''[[Arixenina]]''': Represented by two genera, ''[[Arixenia]]'' and ''[[Xeniaria]]''.  As with Hemimerina, they are blind, wingless ectoparasites with filiform segmented cerci.  They are ectoparasites of various Southeast Asian bats, particularly of the genus ''[[Cheiromeles]]'' (i.e., "naked bulldog bats").

==Physiology==
Most earwigs are elongated, flattened, and are dark brown. Lengths are mostly in the 10–14&nbsp;mm range, with the [[St. Helena earwig]] reaching 80&nbsp;mm. Cerci range from nonexistent to long arcs up to one-third as long as the rest of the body. As in other orthopteroid insects, mouthparts are adapted for chewing. When earwigs have wings (are not agnathous), the [[hindwing]]s are folded in a complex fashion, so that they fit under the [[forewing]]s. Earwigs rarely fly.

The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing of the forceps. The forceps are used for a variety of purposes. In some species, the forceps have also been observed in use for holding [[prey]], and in [[copulation]]. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females. 

Most earwigs found in Europe and North America belong to the [[species]] ''[[Forficula auricularia]]'', the European earwig, which is distributed throughout the cooler parts of the northern hemisphere. They feed on other insects, plants, ripe fruit, and garbage. Plants they feed on typically include [[clover]], [[dahlia]]s, [[zinnia]]s, [[butterfly bush]], [[hollyhock]], [[lettuce]], [[strawberry]], [[sunflowers]], [[celery]], [[peach]]es, [[plum]]s, [[grapes]], [[potato]]es, [[rose]]s, seedling [[bean]]s and [[beet]]s, and tender [[grass]] shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat [[maize|corn]] silk, damaging the corn. Typically they are a nuisance because of their diet, but normally do not present serious hazards to crops. Some tropical species are brightly colored. Occasionally earwigs are confused with [[cockroach]]es because of their cerci and their long antennae. Earwigs are most active at night and can be seen patrolling household walls and ceilings. Interaction with earwigs at this time results in a defensive free fall to the ground below, and the subsequent scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice.

Earwigs are also drawn to damp conditions. During the summer, they can be found around sinks and in bathrooms. Earwigs tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere they can remain concealed in daylight hours. Picnic tables, compost and waste bins, patios, lawn furniture, window frames or anything with minute spaces (even [[artichoke]] blossoms) can potentially harbor these unwanted residents. Upon gaining entry to the basement and living areas of the home, earwigs can easily find cover in undisturbed magazine and newspaper piles, furniture/wickerwork, base boards, carpeted stairways, pet food dishes, and even inside DVD cases and keyboards. Earwigs are inclined to take risks and are exploratory creatures but are overly unaware of the consequences and are often found trapped in poison baited cups or buckets of soapy water.

==Pest control==
While earwigs can be considered in some ways a beneficial part of the garden, especially when they prey on other insects, they can become a nuisance because of their habit of hiding within leaves and feeding on soft plant tissues. Since they prefer cool, moist places, a rolled up damp newspaper placed where earwig activity is suspected can be effective in collecting them. The newspaper can then either be discarded or shaken out. Placing [[diatomaceous earth]] in key spots around the home (bathroom, baseboards, window frames) can be a long-term repellent.

Another method of removing earwigs is by utilizing their attraction to vegetable oil. Putting vegetable oil in a pie tin and burying it up to the rim of the tin is an effective way of capturing them.
Another effective method of earwig control is to take steps to control the population before they hatch by removing rotting underbrush and spraying with commercially available insecticidal [[nematodes]], which invade the earwigs in their nymphal stage and infect them with a lethal bacterium.
