The '''Clan Fraser''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] - ''Frisealach,'' [[French Language|French]] ''"Clan Frasier"'') is a [[Scottish clan]] of [[Gaul|Gaulish]] origin. The [[French language|French]] word for [[Strawberry]] is ''fraise'' and the plants are called ''fraisiers''. The arms of Clan Fraser are ''Quarterly: 1st and 4th Azure, three fraises Argent, 2nd and 3rd Gules, three antique crowns Or,'' or in [[layman's terms]], the traditional three cinquefoils, or Fraises (strawberry flowers), as they have come to be known, in the first and fourth positions and three crowns in the second and third positions. 

Only the [[Simon Fraser, 16th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] is entitled to use these arms as such. Although [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun]] is the head of the [[Scottish lowlands|Lowland]] family of Fraser, the current chief of Clan Fraser is '''[[Simon Fraser, 16th Lord Lovat]]''', grandson of the [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat|famed Commando]] of the [[Second World War]]. He is traditionally referred to as the "'''MacShimidh'''," Gaelic meaning "Son of Simon." Simon is the traditional name for the chiefs of Clan Fraser, and the name of the Fraser from whom all Frasers of the Clan trace their lineage ([[Simon Fraser (d. 1306)|Simon Fraser]], who died in [[1306]].

==History==
===Origins===

The Frasers probably come from [[Anjou]], in [[France]], and the name may derive either from Fredarius, from Fresel or from Freseau. It has even been suggested that they descend from a tribe called Friselii in [[Roman Gaul]], whose badge was a [[strawberry]] plant. In his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Bello Gallico]], [[Julius Caesar]] mentions this tribe, wearing red checked pants. This is reminiscent of the Red & Black tartan in use by many Frasers today. It should be noted, however, that any connection between the Gaulish tribe and the Gaelic Clan is purely speculative.

===Appearance and Early Movement in Scotland===

In [[1160]], another [[Simon Fraser]] held lands in [[East Lothian]] at [[Keith, Scotland|Keith]]. In that same year, he made a gift of a church at Keith in East Lothian to the monks at [[Kelso Abbey]], the first recorded appearance of the Frasers in [[Scotland]]. This is our earliest written record of Frasers, yet there exist countless stories and [[folk tale]]s as to the origins of the Clan Fraser.

Another story, favoured by [[Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat]], and Sir [[George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie|George MacKenzie]], [[Lord Advocate|Lord Advocate of Scotland]], derives their descent from Pierre Fraser, Seigneur de Troile, who came to Scotland with the ambassadors of [[Charlemagne]], around [[807]], mentioning the arms of the family, which are to this day, '''a field azure, semi,''' with strawberries flowers, or ''fraises.'' The only difference is that the arms once contained more strawberry flowers. Pierre was made [[Thegn]] of the [[Isle of Man]] in 814, and one group of Frasers still live there today under the Gaelic name of Frisael. His direct descendants were to become the lords of [[Oliver Castle]]. Another similar story can be found [http://www.nal.usda.gov/pgdic/Strawberry/book/bokfour.htm here]. One which tells a tale involving [[William the Lion]] can be found [http://www.scottish-heirloom.com/scottish_clans_history/fraser_clan.pdf here] The stories of [[Julius de Berry]] were regarded by Archibald Campbell Fraser to have been of a second group of Frasers.

The Frasers moved into [[Tweeddale]] in the [[12th century|twelfth]] and [[13th century|thirteenth]] centuries and from there into the counties of [[Stirlingshire|Stirling]], [[Angus]], [[Inverness-shire|Inverness]] and [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeen]].

===Wars of Scottish Independence===
Sir [[Simon Fraser (d. 1306)|Simon Fraser]] fought with Sir [[William Wallace]] and [[Robert the Bruce]] during the Scottish [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Wars of Independence]].

*[[Battle of Roslin]] - [[1303]] Sir Simon is famously celebrated for having defeated the [[England|English]] on three separate occasions on [[24th February]] 1303.

*[[Battle of Methven]] - [[1306]] Sir Simon leads troops along with Bruce, saving the King's life in three separate instances. Simon was allegedly awarded the 3 Crowns which now appear in the [[Frasers of Lovat|Lovat Arms]] for these three acts of bravery. At the end of the day, he was captured by the [[England|English]] and executed with great cruelty by [[Edward I of England|King Edward]] in [[1306]], in the same barbaric fashion as Wallace.

*[[Battle of Bannockburn]] - [[1314]] Simon's cousin or possibly son, Sir [[Alexander Fraser of Cowie]], was much more fortunate. He fought at Bannockburn, married Bruce's sister, and became [[Chamberlain]] of Scotland. The Frasers of Philorth trace their lineage from Alexander.

*[[Battle of Halidon Hill]] - [[1333]] Another Simon Fraser, along with two of his brothers are killed while fighting the English.

===A New Home===
[[Image:Scotlan Beauly Priory.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The magnificent remains of [[Beauly]] Priory.]]
Sir Simon acquired the Bisset Lands around [[Beauly]] when he won the hand of its heiress, and these lands became the family home. [[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]] granted the right of the ''"Lordship of Loveth, vulgo Morich,"'' in the [[Aird, Inverness|Aird]], in [[1253]]. A copy of this charter may be found [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_right_of_the_Lordship_of_Lovat here]. A record from [[1367]] describes Hugh Fraser as ''"[[Lord Lovat|Lord of Lovat]] and [[portioner]] of [[Aird, Inverness|Ard]]."'' By [[1422]] the Frasers of Lovat had extended their lands to include [[Stratherrick]] by [[Loch Ness]], together with part of [[Glenelg, Scotland|Glenelg]].  In the 13th century, the Frasers of Muchalls erected a [[towerhouse]] stronghold overlooking the [[North Sea]] in [[Kincardineshire]], which later became known as [[Muchalls Castle]].

Although the exact date of creation is uncertain, some time between [[1456]] and [[1464]], Hugh Fraser was raised to the peerage as Lord Lovat or Lord Fraser of Lovat. Around [[1511]], the chiefs established their seat at the site of their last three hereditary castles. The first was destroyed in the [[13th century|thirteenth century]], [[Castle Dounie]] was burned down in 1746 as a result of the Clan's participation in the Jacobite risings (see below). The present [[Beaufort Castle, Scotland|Beaufort Castle]] is relatively modern, being in the Scottish Barronial style. The castle was sold by the [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]], to repay debts incurred by his son, [[Simon Augustine Fraser]], Master of Lovat, in [[1994]]. However, his son, the [[Simon Fraser, 16th Lord Lovat|present Lord Lovat]], has vowed to buy the ancestral home back.

===Clan Wars===

As most all Highlanders, the Frasers have been involved in countless instances of Clan warfare, particularly against the Macdonalds. [[Image:Fraser lands 1587.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Fraser lands are shown in blue. This map is accurate to the [[Parliament of Scotland#The_Sixteenth_Century|acts]] of [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]] [[1587]] & [[1594]]. Click to enlarge.]]

Two Fraser war cries have been largely recognized, both in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]. The first, '''''"Caisteal Dhuni"''''' (Castle Dounie/Downie) refers to the ancestral Castle and Clan seat, which once existed near the present [[Beaufort Castle]]. The second is '''''"A Mhor-fhaiche"''''' (The Great Field).

*The Frasers fought a great clan battle against the [[Clan MacDonald of Clan Ranald]] in 1544, ''Blar-ne-Léine,'' in Gaelic, the [[Battle of the Shirts]], over the disputed chiefship of Clan Ranald. The Frasers, as part of a large coalition, backed a son of the 5th Chief, Ranald ''Gallda'' (the Stranger), which the MacDonalds found unacceptable. Prevented from battle by the [[Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]], the 300 Frasers were ambushed on their march home by 500 MacDonalds. Only five Frasers and eight MacDonalds are said to have survived the bloody engagement. Both the Lovat Chief, [[Hugh Fraser, 3rd Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and his son and heir were amongst the dead and were buried at [[Beauly Priory]]. Despite these atrocities, the Frasers were stronger than ever before within a hundred years.

*Robert Mor Munro, 15th chief of [[Clan Munro]] , was a staunch supporter of [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]], and he consequently was treated favourably by her son, [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]]. Robert was also a faithful friend of Mary. Buchanan states, when the unfortunate princess went to [[Inverness]] in [[1562]], that: "as soon as they heard of their sovereign's danger, a great number of the most eminent Scots poured in around her, especially the '''Frasers''' and Munros, who were esteemed the most'' 'valiant of the clans inhabiting those countries in the north.' ''" These two clans took [[Inverness Castle]] for the Queen, which had refused her admission. The Queen later hanged the governor, a [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]] who had refused her admission.[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/m/munro2.html]

*In 1571 the Clan Fraser joined forces with the [[Clan Forbes]] in their feud against the [[Clan Gordon]]. The Forbes were also joined by [[Clan Keith]] and [[Clan Crichton]]. The Gordons were also joined by [[Clan Leslie]], [[Clan Irvine]] and [[Clan Seton]]. The feud between the Gordons and Forbes which had gone on for centuries culminated in two full scale battles: The Battle of Tillieangus and the Battle of Craibstone. It was at the Battle of Tillieangus that the 6th Lord Forbes's youngest son known as Black Aurther Forbes was killed. Legend has it that "''he stooped down to quench his thirst and one of the Gordons gave him his death blow through an open joint in his armour''".

*A battle took place between the Clan Fraser and [[Clan Logan]] at [[Kessock]] where Gilligorm the Chief of Clan Logan was killed.

===Call to Arms & Civil War===
[[Image:Illustration Taxus baccata0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Traditionally, Frasers wear small branches of ''Iubhar'' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]), or [[Taxus baccata|Yew]], in their caps.]]
During the [[Scottish Civil War|Civil War]] of [[1644]]–[[1650]], the Clan Fraser were as active as ever and supported the cause of the Covenantors.

*In [[1645]], at the [[Battle of Aldearn]], in [[Nairnshire]], the Clan Fraser opposed the Royalist leader [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]], and fought under a Fraser of Struy (a small village at the mouth of [[Glen Strathfarrar]]). Eighty-seven Frasers fell at Aldearn. On this battle, a poem was composed:
<blockquote>
''"Here Fraser Fraser kills, a Browndoth kills a Browndoth''
''A Bold a Bold, and Lieth's by Lieth overthrown.''
''A [[Clan Forbes|Forbes]] against a Forbes and her doeth stand,''
''And [[Clan Drummond|Drummonds]] fight with Drummonds hand to hand.''
''There dith Magill cause a Magill to die,''
''And [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]] doth the strenth of Gordon try.''
''Oh! Scotland, were though Mad? Off thine own native gore.''
''So Much till now thou never shedst before."''
</blockquote>

*In [[1649]], the Clan Fraser was again joined by the [[Clan Munro]] to take Inverness Castle. This time, they were also joined  by the [[Clan Urquhart]] and the [[Clan MacKenzie]], who they had recently made peace with. They were all opposed to the authority of the current [[parliament]]. They assaulted the town and took the castle. They then expelled the garrison and raised the [[fortifications]]. However, on the approach of the parliamentary forces led by [[General Leslie]], all of the clans retreated back into [[Ross-shire]]. Over the next year, several skirmishes took place between these parties.

*In [[1650]], at the [[Battle of Dunbar]], the Clan Fraser fought on the side of the Scottish Covenanters who were opposed the forces of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. However, they were defeated by Cromwell's forces. 

*In [[1651]], the Clan Fraser joined joined the King's army at Stirling. They fought at the [[Battle of Worcester]] where the King's army was defeated by Oliver Cromwell's [[New Model Army]].

===Jacobite Risings===
[[Image:Simon Fox.gif|thumb|left|[[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon "the Fox" Fraser]], 
11th Lord Lovat, [[1668]]. The Fox was Chief during the second and third [[Jacobite Risings]].]]
====Bonnie Dundee====
In [[1689]], [[Thomas Fraser, 10th Lord Lovat|Thomas Fraser]] tried to hold his clan from joining [[John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee|Bonnie Dundee]], to no avail. The Clan marched without him, in support of the Stewarts, and fought at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]]. The following year, the Chief finally joined them.

====The Fifteen====
The Clan Fraser supported the British government during [[Jacobite rising#the .27fifteen|The Fifteen]]. In [[1715]] Simon Fraser of Lovat (who had been outlawed and in exile, by Stewarts), put pressure on the Jacobite garrison in Inverness. The Jacobites at Inverness were trapped by Fraser, the [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch]] did attempt to reach them but their path was blocked by the Frasers and Keppoch was forced to retreat. [http://www.electricscotland.com/mackenzie/images/CHAPT.10.pdf] Inverness was delivered up to Fraser on the very day when the [[Battle of Sheriffmuir]] was fought and another Jacobite force was defeated at the [[Battle of Preston]]. Soon after this 31 year old Chief Colonel Robert Munro of Foulis marched into the town of Inverness with 400 Munros and took over control as governor from Fraser. In [[1719]] the Clan Fraser fought for the British government at the [[Battle of Glenshiel]] where they helped defeat the Jacobites and [[Clan MacKenzie|MacKenzies]] alike.

====The Forty-Five====
The infamous [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon the Fox]] was also chief during [[Jacobite rising#the .27forty-five|The '45]], and supported the Jacobites and [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]], contrary to his action during [[The Fifteen]] (though, his clan did indeed rally for [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Jamie]]). Frasers were on the front lines of the Jacobite army at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)]], and the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746.

=====Culloden=====
At the [[Battle of Culloden]], Frasers made up the largest Centre Regiment of the Front line, with 400 men under [[Charles Fraser of Inverallochy|Charles Fraser]] of [[Inverallochy]], and [[General Simon Fraser of Lovat|Simon Fraser]], Master of Lovat (the Fox was, conveniently, not present at the battle, reportedly trying to gather dispersed Clansmen to fight). Being on the front line, the Frasers were one of the few units to actually close with Government forces, breaking through Barrell’s regiment with 800-900 other Highlanders ([[Atholl]] men, [[Clan Cameron|Camerons]], [[Clan Stewart of Appin|Stewarts of Appin]]), the ferocious Frasers were massacred by the Government second line. Shortly after the [[Battle of Culloden]], Simon the Fox watched his castle go down in flames.

====Aftermath====
[[Image:Fraser Grave at Culloden Moor.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Fraser gravestone at Culloden Moor. Frasers who fell at the [[Battle of Culloden]] were burried in a mass grave underneath this stone. Hundreds may lie underneath it. Each clan had its own grave.]]In [[1746]] Castle Dounie was burnt to the ground, while the Fox was on the run. He was tried for treason and executed in [[London]] on 9th April [[1747]], and his estates and titles were forfeited to the Crown. Many noted that the man possessed the utmost dignity to the end.

The Fox's son, Simon Fraser escaped punishment, and was pardoned - later raising a Fraser regiment for the British army which fought in Canada in the [[1750s]], including [[Quebec]]. Charles Fraser was mortally wounded and found by [[Henry Hawley|General Hawley]] on the field, who ordered one of his aides, a young [[James Wolfe]] to finish him off with a pistol. Wolfe refused, so Hawley got a common soldier to do it. We also know the fate of some of the clansmen. David Fraser of Glen Urquhart, who was a deaf-mute had, it was said, charged and killed seven redcoats, but was captured and died in prison. John Fraser, also called ‘MacIver’ was shot in the knee, taken prisoner and put before a firing squad, but was then rescued by a British officer, [[Lord Boyd]], who was sick of the slaughter. Another John Fraser, who was [[Provost]] of [[Inverness]] tried to get fair treatment for the prisoners.

Castle Dounie was replaced by a small square building costing £300 in which the Royal Commissioner resided until [[1774]], when some of the forfeited Lovat estates were granted by an [[Act of Parliament]] to his son, Simon Fraser ([[1726]]-[[1782]]), by then a major general, in recognition of his military service to the Crown and the payment of some £20,000. Later, two modest wings were added. On the death of General Fraser’s younger half-brother, [[Colonel]] [[Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat]] (1736-1815), without legitimate surviving male issue, the Lovat estates were transferred, by entail, to [[Thomas Alexander Fraser]] of [[Strichen]]([[1802]]-[[1875]]), a distant cousin who was descended from Thomas Fraser of Knockie & Strichen ([[1548]]-[[1612]]), second son of [[Alexander Fraser, 4th Lord Lovat]] ([[1527]]-[[1557]]). Knockie was sold about [[1727]] to [[Hugh Fraser of Balnain]] ([[1702]]-[[1735]]).

===Frasers in the New World===
[[Image:Malcolm Fraser.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sir [[Malcolm Fraser (surveyor)|Malcolm Fraser]], [[1834]]–[[1900]], public servant in [[Western Australia]] (not the Australian Prime Minister).]]

====Seven Years War====
Under the chief, Simon (Who had led the Frasers in the '45 as the Master of Lovat) a regiment of Frasers, the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]], numbering fourteen hundred were raised and [[Seven Years War|fought the French and Indians]] in the [[Thirteen colonies|colonies]] and in [[Canada]], from [[1757]]-[[1759]].

====American rebellion====
Fighting against [[American Revolutionary War|American independence]], Simon, by this time a General, raised twenty-three hundred men, the [[71st Fraser Highlanders]]. He recruited two battalions, raised at [[Inverness]], [[Stirling]] and [[Glasgow]]. Mostly men were not of the name, for the number of Frasers thirty years after Culloden and the end of the clan system, had been substantially reduced.

====Diaspora====
Many Frasers settled in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] after the [[Seven Years' War|war against the French]] in [[Quebec]]. Many others emigrated to those countries and to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. There are Frasers by many names in many countries throughout the world.

Frasers in the [[United States of America|U.S.]] have continued their proud military tradition, fighting on both sides of the [[American Civil War]]. Frasers from both sides of the Atlantic fought in the [[World War I|Great War]], and the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==Two Chiefs==
On [[May 1]], [[1984]], by [[decree]] of the [[Lyon Court|Court]] of the [[Lord Lyon]], the [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun|21st Lady Saltoun]] was made'' "Chief of the name and arms of the whole Clan Fraser"''. It should be noted, that the Lord Lovat did not grant the Chiefship of the Clan Fraser, simply a description of "Chief of the name and arms." The Lord Lovat does not have power over the Chiefship of a Highland Clan. [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/lyondocs.htm#Maclean%20of%20Ardgour] Since this decree, there has been much confusion as to the Chiefship of the Clan Fraser.

When Simon the Pater's descendants first acquired the Lovat lands of the Ard, in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], they took to the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] customs of the area. This included everything from [[Scottish Gaelic language|language]], ways of [[Gaelic warfare|warfare]], to [[Gaelic Clothing and Fashion|clothing and fashion]], even giving their children Gaelic names. By the time Simon's son came of age to lead the family, he was deemed to be the 1st Chief of Clan Fraser, the MacShimidh.
[[Image:Saltoun Lovat.jpg|thumb|Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun, and Simon Fraser, 18th Lord Lovat together at Castle Fraser, during the [[1997]] Clan Gathering]]
Frasers who stayed in the [[Scottish lowlands|Lowlands]], however, maintained [[Teutonic]] ([[Germanic]]), or Norman culture. They became a very respectable and well-to-do family, but stayed well out of Clan affairs. They took no part in Clan warfare, spoke [[Scots Language|Scots]], and dressed like Lowlanders.

According to [[Alexander Fraser, 18th Lord Saltoun|Alexander Fraser]], 18th [[Lord Saltoun]], his family ''"continued to have their principal seat in the Lowlands, and those of the surname who remained in that section of Scotland, where Teutonic institutions prevailed, and whence the patriarchal system of Clans and Clanships had long been banished, had nothing to do with the origin or formation of the Highland Clan, and never belonged to it."''

According to the [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun|Lady Saltoun]], his descendant,
''"The [[Frasers of Philorth]], [[Lord Saltoun|the Lords Saltoun]], being the senior line, are Chiefs of the name of Fraser, although a [[Scottish lowlands|lowland]] family. [[Simon Fraser, 18th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] is Chief of the very numerous [[Scottish highlands|Highland]] Clan Fraser of Lovat, based in [[Inverness-shire]]."'' [http://www.fraserchief.co.uk/twochiefs.html]

It should be noted that the Lady Saltoun is not a descendant of the Shimidh, the Simon from whom the Clan Fraser traces its lineage. As explained elsewhere, she is descended from the Shimidh's older brother. So, though the Lord Lovat is still the Chieftain of Clan Fraser, the MacShimidh, the Lord Lyon has made official the seniority of the Lady Saltoun's line.

The selection of a clan chieftain is traditionally very different than the Teutonic/Norman system of inherited titles. A Clan would elect and follow whatever chief it chose. Unfortunately, from a history student's perspective, in the case of the Clan Fraser, this decree has muddied the waters a bit, regarding both what the Clan truly is and has been. [http://www.fraserclan-cal.net/philorth.html] Frasers differ on the matter, but most Lovats still regard the Lord Lovat as their chief, while many lowland Frasers, who have latched on to the romanticised view of Clans and the Highlands, are happy to have found a way to link themselves to Highland culture. There is, of course, some cross-over of opinions, Frasers tend to respect each other as fellow Frasers, regardless of where they come from.

==Military Regiments==
