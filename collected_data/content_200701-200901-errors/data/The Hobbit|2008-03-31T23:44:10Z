R. R. Tolkien]] in the tradition of the [[fairy tale]]. Tolkien wrote the story in the late 1920s initially to amuse his three sons. It was first published on [[September 21]], [[1937]] to wide critical acclaim.

While ''The Hobbit'' stands in its own right as a complete, self-contained story, it is also the precursor to Tolkien's second, longer novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The publisher requested a sequel due to the success of ''The Hobbit''', though ''The Lord of the Rings'' was not to be finished and published until 17 years after the original.  ''The Hobbit'' has been republished and adapted many times since its first edition.

==Characters==

*[[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular protagonist, a respectable, comfort-loving, middle-aged [[hobbit]].
*[[Gandalf]], an itinerant [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] who introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], then disappears and reappears at key points in the story.
*[[Thorin Oakenshield]], bombastic head of the company of dwarves and heir to a dwarven kingdom under the [[Lonely Mountain]].
*[[Smaug]], a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarven kingdom of Thorin's grandfather.

The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance, such as the twelve other dwarves of the company; [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elves]]; [[Man (Middle-earth)|men]] (humans); [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]]; [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]]; giant spiders; [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]]; [[Warg]]s (evil wolves); [[Elrond]] the sage; [[Gollum]], a mysterious creature inhabiting an underground lake; [[Beorn]], a man who can assume bear-form; and [[Bard the Bowman]], a heroic archer of [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]].

==Synopsis==
Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin's band of dwarves, who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]] Smaug. When the music ends Gandalf unveils a map showing a [[secret passage|secret door]] into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition's "burglar". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.

The group travels into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to [[Rivendell]]. There Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. Passing over the [[Misty Mountains]], they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Though Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblin tunnels. Groping along lost, he finds a [[one ring|ring]] and then encounters Gollum, who engages him in a game of [[riddles]] with deadly stakes. With the help of the ring (which confers [[invisibility]]), Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, raising his reputation. The goblins and Wargs give chase and the company are saved by eagles before resting in the house of the shape-shifter [[Beorn]]. 

The company enter the black forest of [[Mirkwood]] without Gandalf. There Bilbo first saves the dwarves from [[Giant Spider]]s and then from the dungeons of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]]. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A noble [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] who overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability reports it to Bard the Bowman, who slays the Dragon.

When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the prized [[Arkenstone]] gem and steals it. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the Mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the north, reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is intransigent. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.

Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men, and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Thorin, mortally wounded, lives long enough to part from Bilbo as a friend. The treasure is divided fairly, but, having no need or desire for it, Bilbo refuses most of his contracted share. Nevertheless, he returns home with enough to make himself a very wealthy hobbit.

==Concept and creation==
===Writing===
In a 1955 letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects that in the early 1930s, when he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], he began ''The Hobbit'' when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found one blank page. Suddenly inspired he wrote the words "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Thrór|Thrór's]] map, outlining the geography of the tale.<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|#163}}</ref> By late 1932 he had finished the story and gave it to [[C. S. Lewis]] to read.<ref>{{ME-ref|Bio|p. 181}}</ref> It was eventually published when a family friend and student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths was lent the typescript of the story.<ref name="Letter294">{{ME-ref|Letters|#294}}</ref> When Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall in 1936, a staffmember of the publisher [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]], she either lent Dagnall the book<ref name="Letter294" /> or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien<ref name="Biop184">{{ME-ref|Bio|p. 184}}</ref> (the sources differ). In any event, Miss Dagnall, impressed by it, showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by Allen & Unwin.<ref name="Biop184" />

=== Publication ===
[[Image:Hobbit cover.JPG|right|200px|thumb|200px|Dustcover of the first edition of ''The Hobbit''. This cover was taken from a design by Tolkien, as was the binding illustrated at the top of this article.]]
George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' on September 21, 1937. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by December due to enthusiastic reviews.<ref name="hammond-anderson">{{cite book | last = Hammond | first = Wayne | coauthors = Douglas A.

Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography | publisher = [[Oak Knoll Press]] | location = New Castle, Delaware | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-938768-42-5 | pages = 15,18,21,48,54}}</ref> Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York prepared an American edition to be released early in 1938 in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937.<ref name="hammond-anderson"/> Despite the book's popularity, paper rationing brought on by wartime conditions and not ended until 1949 meant that the book was often unavailable in this period.<ref>Anderson, Douglas A., ed.''The Annotated Hobbit''. Revised Edition. Harper Collins. London, 2003. ISBN 0-00-713726-3. pp. 22</ref>

The first printing of the first English language edition can sell for between £6,000<ref>''The Hobbit sells for £6,000'', bbc.co.uk, 26/11/04[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4045667.stm]</ref>  and £20,000 at auction,<ref>Walne, Toby.

Following the original publication of ''The Hobbit'' in 1937, new [[Edition (books)|editions]] in English were published in 1951, 1966, 1978 and 1995 and the novel has been [[English-language editions of The Hobbit | reprinted frequently by various publishers]]. <ref>Anderson, Douglas A., ed.''The Annotated Hobbit''. Revised Edition. Harper Collins. London, 2003. ISBN 0-00-713726-3. pp. 384-386</ref> In addition, ''The Hobbit'' has been [[Translations of The Hobbit|translated into over forty languages]]. Some languages have seen multiple translations.<ref> Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' p. 23</ref>

====Revisions====
In December 1937 Tolkien's publisher Stanley Unwin asked for a sequel. The editors rejected Tolkien's drafts for the ''Silmarillion'', believing that the public wanted 'more about hobbits'. Accordingly the author began work on what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings]],''<ref name="carpenter-tolkien"/> a course that would not only change the context of the original story but also lead to substantial changes to the character Gollum.

In the first edition of ''The Hobbit'', Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988)</ref> In order to reflect the new concept of the [[One Ring|ring]] and its powerful hold on Gollum Tolkien decided a rewrite of the Gollum encounter in ''The Hobbit'' was in order, and he sent a revised version to his publishers. He heard nothing further for years. When he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition he learned to his surprise the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding.<ref name="carpenter-tolkien">{{cite book | last = Carpenter | first = Humphrey | authorlink = Humphrey Carpenter | title = J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography | publisher = [[George Allen & Unwin]] | location = London | year = 1977 | oclc = 3046822}}</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'' the original version of the riddle-game is explained as a "lie"  made up by Bilbo, and that the revised versions of ''The Hobbit'' contain the "true" version of events.<ref name = "prologue">{{ME-ref|fotr|Prologue}}</ref> This became the second edition, published in 1951 in both the UK and America.<ref name="hammond-anderson"/>

After an unauthorized paperback edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published by Ace in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine requested Tolkien to provide a new authorized text of ''The Hobbit'', in order to re-assert US copyright control.<ref>Rateliff, John D ''The History of the Hobbit. Part 2: Return to Bag-End'' p765</ref> This text became the (1966) third edition.  Tolkien took the opportunity to further adjust the narrative to conform with ''The Lord of the Rings'' and to developments in his still unpublished ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' as it stood at that time.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988), Flies and Spiders, note 23</ref>  These minor changes included, for example, that the phrase ''elves that are now called [[Gnome]]s'', which appeared in the first<ref name="Hobbit first edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = George Allen & Unwin | location = London | year = 1937 | pages = 63}}</ref> and second<ref name="Hobbit second edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = George Allen & Unwin | location = London | year = 1951 | pages = 63}}</ref> editions on page 63, was changed to ''High Elves of the West, my kin'' in the third edition.<ref name="Hobbit third edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | location = Boston | year = 1966 | pages = 62 | ISBN = 0-395-07122-4}}</ref>. Tolkien had used "Gnome" in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the [[High Elves]]&mdash;the [[Noldor]] (or "Deep Elves")&mdash;thinking that "gnome", derived from the Greek ''gnosis'' (knowledge), was a good name for the wisest of the Elves. However, with its common denotation of a [[garden gnome]], Tolkien ultimately decided to abandon the usage.

In order to make a better tonal fit with its sequel Tolkien began a new version in 1966, removing  the narrative asides. The revision was abandoned at chapter three after Tolkien received criticism that it 'just wasn't ''The Hobbit'''.<ref>Rateliff, John D. ''The History of the Hobbit. Part 2: Return to Bag End.'' p781</ref>

In May and June 2007, HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin published ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' in the United Kingdom. The work examines in two volumes previously unpublished original drafts of ''The Hobbit'' with extensive commentary by [[John Rateliff]].

==Style==
The basic form of the story is that of a [[quest]],<ref>W. H. Auden, "The Quest Hero," in Rose A. Zimbardo and Neil D. Isaaca, eds., ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism''. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston, 2004. 31-51. ISBN 0-618-42251-x.</ref> told in [[episode]]s, a traditional narrative form far removed from the literary movements of the 20th Century.<ref name="Poveda"/>  The general tone is lighthearted, possibly following the model of "The Icelandic Journals" by Tolkien's literary idol [[William Morris]],<ref>Amison, Anne ''An unexpected Guest. influence of William Morris on J. R. R. Tolkien's works'', [[Mythlore]]2006</ref> and interspersed with songs. The dramatic or dangerous scenes are undercut with a sense of humour, such as the foolishness of the Trolls or the onomatopoeic singing of the Goblins.<ref name="randel" /> It displays a close correlation with the narrative models of [[children's literature]], including an [[Omniscient_narrator#Third_person.2C_omniscient.2Fdramatic|omniscient narrator]], characters that pre-adolescent children can identify with, an emphasis on the relationship between time and narrative progress, and a geography which separates notions of 'safe' and 'dangerous'.<ref name="Poveda">Jaume Alberdo Poveda ''Narrative Models in Tolkien's Stories of Middle Earth'',Journal of English Studies, vol. 4, 2003-2004 </ref>  While Tolkien claimed later to dislike the aspect of the narrative voice addressing the reader directly<ref name="Carpenter">{{ME-ref|Biography}}</ref> the narrative voice contributes significantly to the success of the novel, and lends it to being read aloud.<ref>  ''The Hobbit Major Themes'', Cliff Notes, retrieved (30/01/08)[[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/The-Hobbit-Critical-Essays-Major-Themes.id-171,pageNum-68.html]]</ref>

The novel draws on Tolkien's knowledge of historical languages and early European texts (for example, the names of Gandalf and all but one of the thirteen dwarves were taken directly from the [[Old Norse]] poem "Voluspa" from the [[Elder Edda]])<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/lessons/two/handouts.jsp |title=Tolkien's Middle-earth: Lesson Plans, Unit Two |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> and several of the authors illustrations make use of [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[rune]]s.

==Major themes==

The central character, Bilbo, is a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world  because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, whilst those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle-game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to understand each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern is a constant recurring theme throughout ''The Hobbit''.<ref>Shippey, Tom: ''Tolkien: Author of the Century'', HarperCollins, 2000, p.41</ref>

''The Hobbit'' may be read as Tolkien's parable of the [[World War I|First World War]], where the hero is plucked from his rural home, and thrown into a far off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile<ref>Carpenter, Humphrey: ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Review, The Times 2003 [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article1020455.ece ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Review, The Times 2003]</ref> and as such explores the theme of heroism. The theme of war portrayed in literature as an anti-[[pastoral]] is also seen in ''The Hobbit'' where the "Desolation of Smaug" both the area under the influence of Smaug before his demise and the setting for the "Battle of the Five Armies" after, is described as a barren, damaged landscape.<ref>Croft, Janet Brennan ''The Great War and Tolkien's Memory, an examination of World War I themes in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings'' Mythlore,  Fall-Winter, 2002 </ref> 

The [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] concept of [[individuation]] is reflected through the theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author seen to be contrasting Bilbo's personal growth against the lack of that of the dwarves.<ref name="Matthews" /> The theme of a character entering into  enclosed spaces (such as the various hills, caves, dungeons) has a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] dimension, with the additional analogue of the '[[underworld]]' with the hero returning with a boon (such as the ring, or Elvish blades) which benefits his society is seen to fit the mythic [[archetype|archetypes]] regarding initiation and male coming of age as described by [[Joseph Campbell]].<ref name="randel">Helms, Randel McCraw: ''Myth, Magic and Meaning in Tolkien's World'', Granada, 1976. pp.45-55</ref>

Greed plays a central role in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves, or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/notes/hob/TOP1.htm ''The Hobbit'' on Bookrags]</ref>

==Reception and Legacy==

On first publication, ''The Hobbit'' was met with almost unanimously favourable reviews<ref>Anderson, Douglas A., ed.''The Annotated Hobbit''. Revised Edition. Harper Collins. London, 2003. ISBN 0-00-713726-3.</ref>  and was nominated for the [[Carnegie Medal]]. The year following the first edition saw it awarded a prize from the [[New York Herald Tribune]] for best juvenile fiction of the year. More recently ''The Hobbit'' has been recognized as "Most Important 20th-Century Novel (for Older Readers)" in the ''Children's Books of the Century'' poll in ''Books for Keeps''.<ref>[http://www.tolkiensociety.org/faq01.html#awards Tolkien Society FAQ: Did Tolkien win any awards for his books?]</ref>

While ''The Hobbit'' has been [[#Adaptations|adapted]] and elaborated upon in many ways, its sequel ''The Lord of the Rings'' is often claimed to be its greatest legacy. The plots share basic elements, but Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers expecting them to be similar find they are not.<ref name="Kocher">Kocher, Paul ''Master of Middle-earth, the Achievement of J.R.R. Tolkien'' Penguin, 1974, Chapter 2: The Hobbit.</ref> Some differences are in details; for example, goblins are more often referred to as Orcs in ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988)</ref> Many of the thematic differences arose because Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' as a story for children, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' for the same audience who had subsequently grown up since its publication.  Further, Tolkien's concept of Middle-earth was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>Tolkien, Christopher  ''The History of Middle-earth'', Vol 1  "The Book of Lost Tales", p.7</ref>

=== Adaptations ===

==== Dramatisations ====

==== Board, War, and Roleplaying Games====
''The Hobbit'' has been the subject of several [[board games]]:

[[TSR]] released 2 editions of a wargame based on ''The Battle of Five Armies'', designed by Larry Smith in 1976/1977 using cardboard tokens and a map of the area around the Lonely mountain as a game-area. The game was criticized for a lack of clearness in the rules, and praised for evoking the onslaught of the warg and goblin army.<ref>Easterbrook, Martin, ''Open Box Review'' [[White Dwarf (magazine)]] #3,Oct/Nov 1977 p 15</ref>

''The Lonely Mountain''  (1984, [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]]),<ref name="white_dwarf_57"> ''Newsboard'', ''Fellowship Follows'', [[White Dwarf (magazine)]] #57, September, 1984 p45 </ref> designed by Coleman Charlton, features groups of adventurers entering Smaug's Lair to capture his treasure before he awakens.  The same year, the same publisher also published their version of ''The Battle of Five Armies'' <ref name="white_dwarf_57" />  developed by Richard H. Britton, Coleman Charlton, and John Crowell, again a wargame using card counters and a paper map.

"The Hobbit Adventure Boardgame" (1997) was the last game from  [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]]  based directly on ''The Hobbit'' they continued to publish the [[MERP|Middle-earth Role Playing Game]] a game licensed on both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' properties which combined elements from both works, between 1982 and 1999.<ref>[http://www.invasivedesigns.com/otherhands/frames_what.html "What is MERP?"] on Other Hands</ref>

The multi-[[Origins Award|Origin Award]] winning ''Middle-earth Strategic Gaming'' (formerly ''Middle-earth-Play by-Mail''), run by GSI uses the ''Battle of Five Armies'' as an introductory scenario to the full game and includes characters and armies from the book.<ref>More information can be found at: [http://middleearthgames.com/modbofa.html the Middle-earth Games page for the game] (retrieved 25/02/08)</ref>

[[Games Workshop]] released a ''Battle of Five Armies'' (2005) [[tabletop wargame]], designed by [[Rick Priestley]] using highly detailed 10 mm figures sculpted by Mark Harrison, based on Games Workshop's [[Warmaster]] rules and designed for the home player.<ref>Jones, Rich, [http://www.wargamesjournal.com/pdfmagazine/Issue_1.pdf ''Battle of the Five Armies Rules and miniatures for recreating battles in Middle Earth''], Wargames Journal 1, 2005 p.91</ref><ref>More information can be found at: [http://www.specialist-games.com/bofa/whatis.asp Games Workshop's Specialist Games site] </ref>

[[Image:Hobbit adventure packaging.jpg|right|200px|thumb|200px|Cover of the award winning computer game]] Several [[Video game|computer and video games]], both official and unofficial, have been based on the story.
