'''Lewis Carl Hamilton''' (born January 7, 1985 in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Formula One]] (F1) [[Auto racing#Single-seater racing|driver]]. He drives for the [[McLaren|McLaren Mercedes]] Formula One team and currently leads the drivers' championship.

==Personal and early life==
Hamilton's [[paternal]] grandparents emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] from [[Grenada]] in the 1950s. His grandfather worked on the [[London Underground]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Grenadian roots of first black F1 driver |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/11/061127_grenadaf1.shtml |date=[[2006-11-27]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> His mother Carmen, and father Anthony (who is now an IT consultant), named him after the US Olympic gold medal winning athlete [[Carl Lewis]].<ref>Sourced from [[ITV]]'s 2007 Bahrain Grand Prix commentary</ref> Hamilton's parents separated when he was two. Until he was ten Hamilton lived with his mother; after that he lived with his father, step-mother and half-brother Nicholas who has [[cerebral palsy]]. At six, Hamilton began his racing career when his father bought him his first [[go-kart]]. Anthony Hamilton held down three jobs to support his son's career and still found enough time to attend all of his races. He continued racing whilst still attending [[The John Henry Newman School]].<ref name=zooref>Zoo: Issue 162, 30 March-4 April 2007</ref> When, at an early age, his driving attracted the attentions of the local bullies, Hamilton took up [[karate]], a sport in which, by the time he was twelve, he gained his first [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The real deal|publisher=[[Observer Sport Monthly]] |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329945795-103977,00.html}}</ref>. Hamilton extended his skills to football, playing in his school team alongside current [[Aston Villa]] winger [[Ashley Young]] as a [[midfielder]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The real deal|publisher=[[Observer Sport Monthly]] |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329945795-103977,00.html}}</ref>

==Racing career==

===Karting===
Hamilton began [[kart racing|karting]] in 1993 at the age of eight,<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio"> {{cite web | title = Who's Who: Lewis Hamilton | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2006 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/f1-information/whos-who/whos-who-h/lewis-hamilton/ | accessdate =2006-12-02}}{{Verify credibility}}</ref> and quickly began winning races and championships. When he was nine, he approached [[McLaren]] F1 team boss [[Ron Dennis]] and told him, ''"I'm going to race for you one day... I'm going to race for McLaren"''.

Hamilton started in the Cadet ranks (1993-6). His subsequent progress though the Junior Yamaha (1997) and Junior Intercontinental A (1998-9) divisions earnt him attention from [[McLaren|Team McLaren]], who signed him to the McLaren driver development support programme. This contract included an option of a future F1 seat, thus making Hamilton the youngest ever driver to secure an F1 contract.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

Lewis Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In [[Formula A]] and [[Formula Super A]], racing for TeamMBM.com, his team mate was current Williams driver [[Nico Rosberg]]. Following his karting successes, the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]] made him a ‘Rising Star’ Member in 2000.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

After entering F1, Hamilton's modified [[McLaren]] [[Mercedes]] Kart was sold for charity for £42,000 on internet auction site [[eBay]] in June 2007. Proceeds went to children's charity Tommy's.<ref>{{cite news |title=Charity Auction of Kart |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/20/nkart120.xml |date=[[2007-06-20]] |publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> However the transfer of the kart did not go as smoothly. At a specially organised McLaren event in London, he spun in the kart whilst giving spectators a demonstration on a small circuit created for the event. The kart received damage to the left rear suspension.

===Junior Formulae===
{{quote box|quote="He's a quality driver, very strong and only 16. If he keeps this up I'm sure he will reach F1. It's something special to see a kid of his age out on the circuit. He's clearly got the right racing mentality."|source=[[Michael Schumacher]], speaking about Hamilton in 2001.<ref name="atlasf1">{{cite news |title=Schumacher Tips Hamilton for Future Glory|publisher=AtlasF1|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/5969/.html}}</ref>|width=21%|align=right}}
Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth overall. This led to a full 2002 [[Formula Renault#United Kingdom|Formula Renault UK]] campaign with Manor Motorsport. Hamilton finished third overall with three wins and three pole positions. He remained with Manor for another year and won the championship with ten wins and 419 points to the two wins and 377 points of this nearest rival, [[Alex Lloyd (racing driver)|Alex Lloyd]]. Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his début in the season finale of the [[British Formula Three Championship]]. Here he was less successful, crashing out of both races at Brands Hatch and being taken to hospital after the second.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> He did show his speed at both the [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau]] and Korean Grands Prix. In the latter he qualified on pole position in his first visit to the Korean track and in only his fourth race outing in a F3 car.

Hamilton and Manor then made their debut in the [[2004]] [[Formula Three Euroseries]]. They won just one race and Hamilton was fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix and raced one of the [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau F3 Grand Prix]]. He defected to reigning Euroseries champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds. He also won the [[Ultimate Masters of Formula 3]] at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]].<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

After the season, British magazine ''[[Autosport]]'' featured him in their “Top 50 Drivers of 2005” issue, ranking Hamilton 24th. After Hamilton's success in Formula Three, he was signed by [[ART Grand Prix]] for the [[2006 GP2 Series season]]. Like ASM in F3, ART were the class of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with [[Nico Rosberg]]. Despite stiff opposition from rivals who had raced in the GP2 series during 2005, such as team mate [[Alexandre Prémat]] and [[Nelson Angelo Piquet]], Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt. Among his notable performances was a dominant win at the fifth round held at the [[Nürburgring]], despite serving a penalty for speeding in the [[pit stop|pit lane]].<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

At his home race at [[Silverstone]], supporting the [[British Grand Prix]], Hamilton impressed again by overtaking two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed (up to 150&nbsp;mph in a GP2 car) bends where overtaking is rare. He demonstrated his overtaking prowess again at the race in Istanbul, when he recovered from a spin that left him 18th, to take second place in the final corners. He became GP2 champion in unusual circumstances. [[Giorgio Pantano]] won the penultimate race at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], and set the fastest lap on the final lap, initially taking this bonus point from Hamilton. However, it transpired that he had set this under a yellow flag, indicating to the officials that he had not slowed enough to avoid potential danger, leading to him losing the fastest lap, which therefore gave Hamilton the single point he needed to clinch the title.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

His 2006 GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] to [[NASCAR]] and [[Kimi Räikkönen]] to [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />
[[Image:Luis Hamilton Sepang.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Hamilton finished second in Malaysia, making it two podiums from two starts.]] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, [[Pedro de la Rosa]], [[Gary Paffett]] or former World Champion [[Mika Häkkinen]] would drive for McLaren alongside defending champion [[Fernando Alonso]] in [[2007 Formula One season|2007]], Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver. This surprised many F1 insiders, who felt the more experienced Paffett and de la Rosa were more qualified for a race seat.<ref>{{cite news| title = Lewis Hamilton joins Formula 1 World Champion Fernando Alonso at Vodafone McLaren Mercedes| publisher = mclaren.com| url = http://www.mclaren.com/mediaroom/information/pressreleases/lewis_hamilton.php| date = [[2006-11-24]]| accessdate = 2006-11-24}}</ref> He was told of McLaren’s decision on [[September 30]], but the news was not made public until [[November 24]], for fear that it would be overshadowed by [[Michael Schumacher]]’s retirement announcement.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

===Formula One===

[[Image:Lewis Hamilton 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hamilton driving for [[McLaren]] at the [[2007 Malaysian Grand Prix]].]]

Hamilton is the first black driver of African or Afro-Caribbean ancestry to compete in F1,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/motor_racing/article2013302.ece |title= Hamilton's F1 drive is a dream come true |author=David Tremayne |date=[[2006-11-25]] |accessdate=2006-11-25 |publisher=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> although [[Willy T.

On his début at the [[2007 Australian Grand Prix]], he qualified fourth and finished third in the race, thus becoming the thirteenth driver to finish on the podium on his GP début (excluding those in the first ever World Championship round).<ref>{{cite web | title = Hamilton makes history | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/03/18/hamilton-makes-history/ | accessdate = 2007-03-22}}</ref> In [[2007 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]], Hamilton got his first front-row start, qualifying and finishing second behind [[Felipe Massa]]. Hamilton again finished second in the [[2007 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], again behind Massa, to take the lead in the drivers championship.<ref name="bahrain07">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6557493.stm|title=Massa holds off battling Hamilton|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=April 15|publisher=BBC Sport|year=2007}}</ref> With that achievement, Hamilton surpassed [[Bruce McLaren]] to become the youngest driver to ever lead the world championship.<ref name="Spain07">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyf1news.com/dailyf1news/nieuw/artikel.php?nwsID=3176|title=Race notes: Spanish GP|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=May 13|publisher=Daily F1 News|year=2007}}</ref>

Hamilton has been widely praised. [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team boss [[Frank Williams]] described him as "superhuman", while triple world champions [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Niki Lauda]] are among those who have speculated that Hamilton could win the 2007 championship. Ex-[[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] owner [[Eddie Jordan]] disagreed, believing that while Hamilton has exceptional talent, he will not win the championship this season. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher said that Hamilton's potential was evident during his GP2 season, but he was surprised at the consistency Hamilton has shown so early in his career.<ref name="schumacher video">{{cite video|url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8q1g6aP18|title = Michael Schumacher on Lewis Hamilton| medium =Youtube | publisher = Sky News | accessdate = 2007-06-12| date = 2007-04-23}} </ref> However, Hamilton suffered criticism from former driver and [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] champion [[Jacques Villeneuve]], who accused him of "nitty gritty" at the start of Grands Prix. Villeneuve compared his starts to controversial ones made by [[Michael Schumacher]].<ref name="autosport">{{cite news |title=Hamilton criticised by Villeneuve |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/59478|date=[[2007-06-06]] |publisher=[[Autosport]].com |accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> Hamilton's driving was soon defended by fellow drivers, including [[Giancarlo Fisichella]], [[Alexander Wurz]], [[Nick Heidfeld]], [[Mark Webber]] and [[Felipe Massa]].<ref name="autosport" /><ref name="autosport2">{{cite news |title=Hamilton shrugs off Villeneuve's comments |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/59485|date=[[2007-06-07]] |publisher=[[Autosport]].com |accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>

Controversy surrounded Hamilton's finishing position in the [[2007 Monaco Grand Prix]]. After comments made by Hamilton post-race which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA initiated an inquiry to determine whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders. McLaren denied favouring double world champion [[Fernando Alonso]], and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that: "McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars. They did nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result."<ref>{{cite news| title =FIA McLaren-Monaco Full statement | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/6178.html| date =[[2007-05-30]]| accessdate =2007-06-05}}</ref>

Hamilton gained the first [[pole position]] of his F1 career in the [[2007 Canadian Grand Prix]]. On race day, Hamilton led almost continuously from start to finish, despite having his lead cut on the four occasions the safety car was deployed. The win strengthened his championship challenge.<ref>{{cite news| title =Canadian Grand Prix | publisher =BBC Sport| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6739373.stm| date =[[2007-06-10]]| accessdate =2007-06-11}}</ref> A week later, Hamilton won the [[2007 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]] also from pole position, becoming the first Briton since [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] in [[1983 United States Grand Prix West|1983]] to do so and only the second person to win more than one race in his first F1 Championship season since the first year of the Championship itself. The win extended his lead in the World Championship to ten points over teammate [[Fernando_Alonso|Alonso]].

====Records====

<!-- Please do NOT speculate on records that Hamilton is able to achieve, as this would constitute trivia and speculation.-->

Hamilton has matched or set the following records in Formula One:

* Most consecutive podiums from debut race: 7<ref>http://www.formula1.com/insight/driver/828/5.html</ref>
* Youngest driver to lead the World Championship.<ref>http://www.f1way.com/news/2007/may/13/hamilton-keeps-cool-despite-championship-lead</ref>
* First driver to achieve consecutive wins from pole position in debut season. <!-- I don't have a DIRECT source for this, but as there are so few rookie drivers to have won multiple races it can be easily ascertained. Suggestions on how to deal with this welcome. -->

Hamilton also holds the distinction of being the first driver of African or Caribbean descent to compete, and indeed to win a race in, Formula One.<ref>http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/motorsports/3011AP_CAR_Canadian_GP.html</ref> He is also the first of black descent to win a major race at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in any discipline. In addition, he is the third youngest driver to achieve an F1 pole position, and only the thirteenth driver in F1 history to achieve a podium finish on his debut.

<!-- Again, please do NOT speculate on records that Hamilton is potentially able to achieve. This would be mere speculation. -->
