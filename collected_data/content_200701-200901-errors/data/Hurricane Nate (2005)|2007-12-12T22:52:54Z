'''Hurricane Nate''' was a [[hurricane]] over the [[Atlantic]] during September in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Nate was the fourteenth named storm and seventh hurricane of the season.

Hurricane Nate formed to the southwest of [[Bermuda]] on [[September 5]] and initially moved very slowly to the northeast. Forecasts initially suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to the south on [[September 8]] as a Category 1 hurricane. After moving away from the island, wind shear increased and Nate weakened back into a tropical storm before becoming [[extratropical]] on [[September 10]]. There was no reported damage, although one death was reported off the [[New Jersey]] coast due to [[rip current]]s.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Nate 2005 track.png}}
Tropical Depression Fifteen formed from a complex interaction between a weak tropical wave and a broad low pressure on the morning of [[September 5]] about 350 miles (560 km) south-southwest of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="NateTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Nate|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 30|accessyear=2006|format=PDF|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL152005_Nate.pdf}}</ref> The initial forecast called for only a modest increase in strength, but the depression intensified more quickly than predicted and became Tropical Storm Nate that afternoon, only six hours after it formed.<ref name="NHC-disc1">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Depression Fifteen, 5 p.m. EDT, September 5 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 30|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.001.shtml}}</ref> Tropical Storm Nate moved very slowly to the northeast, as it was trapped between the circulations of [[Hurricane Maria (2005)|Hurricane Maria]] to the north and the developing [[Hurricane Ophelia (2005)|Hurricane Ophelia]] to the west. At this time, the forecasts indicated that Nate could pass close to [[Bermuda]].<ref name="NHC-disc5">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Nate, 5 p.m. EDT, September 6 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 30|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.005.shtml}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane on [[September 7]], as it began to turn away from Bermuda. Some models indicated that Nate could be either be absorbed by or [[Fujiwhara effect|merge]] with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the NHC forecasted that Nate would survive as a separate system, which it indeed did.<ref name="NHC-disc10">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Hurricane Nate, 11 p.m. EDT, September 7 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=April 30|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.010.shtml}}</ref> Nate reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (145 km/h) late on [[September 8]] as it passed 120 miles (205 km) southeast of Bermuda with its strongest winds remaining well offshore.<ref name="NateTCR"/>

Soon after Hurricane Nate had reached its peak strength, increasing wind shear and dry air caused it to weaken back into a tropical storm late on [[September 9]]. Nate accelerated to the northeast, following Maria's path into the open [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nate became extratropical the next day and did not reintensify again before becoming absorbed by a larger system on [[September 12]].<ref name="NateTCR"/>

==Impact==
A [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] was issued for [[Bermuda]] early on [[September 7]] and later that day a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch superseded it. However the storm did not approach the island closely and the warnings were cancelled as the storm moved past the island on [[September 8]].<ref name="NateTCR"/>

[[Canadian Navy]] ships headed to the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], carrying relief supplies to help in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], were slowed down trying to avoid Hurricanes Nate and [[Hurricane Ophelia (2005)|Ophelia]].<ref name="Times">{{cite news|title=Storms slow Canada aid|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=September 11 2005|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/11/Worldandnation/Storms_slow_Canada_aid.shtml}}</ref> The outer bands of Nate brushed Bermuda, with sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and less than 1 inch (25 mm) of rain recorded at [[Bermuda International Airport]]. There were no fatalities as a result of Hurricane Nate in Bermuda, and no damage was reported.<ref name="NateTCR"/>

Rip currents from Nate and the more distant [[Hurricane Maria (2005)|Maria]] killed one and seriously injured another in [[New Jersey]]. <ref name="natemaria">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2005|title=Event Record Details for New Jersey|accessdate=2006-05-31|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~591538}}</ref>

==Naming and records==
When Tropical Storm Nate developed on [[September 5]], it was the earliest ever in the season that the fourteenth named tropical storm developed, beating the previous record held by storm 14 of the [[1936 Atlantic hurricane season|1936 season]].<ref>http://pipsey.net:8080/~thegreatzo/hurricanes.html</ref> Due to the lack of any major effects from Hurricane Nate, the name was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season.
