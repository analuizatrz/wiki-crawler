[[Image:Mach 5.jpg|200px|right||thumb|The '''Mach Five''']]
The '''Mach Five''' (マッハ号; ''mahha gō''; lit. the "Mach") is the [[racing]] [[automobile|car]] [[Speed Racer]] (Go Mifune in the Japanese version) drives in the [[anime]] series of the same name (known as "Mach Go! Go! Go!" in Japan). The car was designed, built, and created by Pops Racer, Speed Racer's father. It features a set of special devices which Speed Racer uses throughout the series. In the original 1966 series, the '''Mach Five''' is a white racing car with an 'M' written on its hood. In the 1993 American remake, the design was completely changed.

Its name probably derives from the fact that speeds above [[Mach number|Mach 5]] are known as [[hypersonic]]. However, the '''Mach Five''' cannot reach Mach speeds.  The name is also a pun in two languages: the word for "five" in Japanese is "go". However, the "go" used for the car's name is a suffix attached to the names of ships, etc. Thus, the car is known in the Japanese version as simply the "Mach".

An actual race car that most closely resembles the '''Mach Five''' would be an early [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]] 2A through 2C, which have a similar cockpit and fender flares, designed by [[Jim Hall]] around [[1963]] through [[1965]].

The car is designed to compete in a type of "open formula" racing, where cars are usually built with the maximum power and minimum of weight. 

==Special features==
[[Image:Mach 5 Steering Wheel.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The '''Mach Five''''s steering wheel]]
The car has seven mechanisms triggered by buttons labelled from A to G on the steering wheel hub. Their functions (and names, taken from the Japanese production) are:

'''Button A''',  Auto Jack:  Releases four [[Jack (mechanical)|jack]]s to boost the car up so that it can be repaired.  Although designed for this function, the auto jacks are more often used to leap the car short distances at high speeds, as a wedge to prevent the car from toppling over a waterfall, or as an alternative braking system. The spring-like sound the jacks make is distinctive to the show.<br>

'''Button B''', Belt Tires:  Sprouts special grip tires for traction over any kind of terrain (firm, icy, or unsteady ground; ocean floor; vertical mountainsides).  At the same time, 5,000 [[horsepower]] (3,700 kW) is distributed evenly to all four wheels.(1,250hp/932.13kW)<br>

'''Button C''', Cutter:  Powerful [[rotary saw]]s protrude from the front of the '''Mach Five''' to slash and cut any and all obstacles. Mostly used for racing in wooded areas (especially when Speed gets forced off the road), the rotary saws have also been used as a means of self-defense.<br>

'''Button D''', Defensor:  Releases a powerful [[deflector]] which seals the cockpit into an air-conditioned, bullet- and crash-proof, and water-tight chamber.  Inside it, the driver is completely isolated and shielded.  The deflector also protects against sleeping gas, as it has its own air supply. <br>

'''Button E''', Evening or Illuminating Eye:  The control for special illumination which can be traversed singly or in tandem, and which enables to see much farther and more clearly than with ordinary [[headlights]].  When used with the “night shades” attached to Speed’s helmet, his vision is enhanced with [[infrared light]].<br>

'''Button F''', Frogger Mode:  Used when the '''Mach Five''' is under water.  First, the cockpit is supplied with oxygen.  Then, a [[periscope]] is raised to scan the surface of the water.  Everything that is seen is relayed down to the driver's seat by television. The 100 pound (45 kg) auxiliary supply of oxygen is enough to last for thirty minutes.<br>

'''Button G''', Gizmo Rocket: Releases a homing [[robot]] from the front of the car.  The homing robot can fly and can carry pictures or tape recorded messages, handwritten messages, X-ray film, rope, and small Egyptian statues, and it has been used as a means of defense.  The bird-like device is operated by a built-in remote control within the cockpit.

'''Button H''', Homing Device: This button is, unlike the other buttons, not located on the steering wheel; instead is located on a console between the seats. Button H is part of the Gizmo Rocket's controls, and it simply sends the robot "home” to a pre-programmed location, usually Speed's house.

The '''Mach Five''' also has a small trunk, which is unusual in a race car but was featured in many episodes, often as a hiding place for supporting characters [[Spritle]] and [[Chim-Chim]].

==Speed Racer X==

In [[Speed Racer X]] (not to be confused with the 1993 Fred Wolf remake), the buttons had name changes, and sometimes function changes:

*'''Button A''', Aero Jack (エアロジャッキ, ''Aerojyakki''): Similar to the Auto-Jacks, but uses compressed air and rocket thrusters to propel the car into the air, rather than actual metal jacks (making "Aero Jack" a bit of a misnomer).  Unlike the original series, this can only be used to make the car jump.
*'''Button B''', Balloon Tire (バルーンタイヤ, ''Barūn Taia''): Inflates the tires like balloons, giving them better traction (similar to [[monster truck]] tires), as well as allowing the Mach 5 to float on water.
*'''Button C''', Cutter Blade (カッターブレード, ''Kattā Burēdo''): Instead of saws, this button activates [[laser]] "blades" to cut through obstacles.
*'''Button D''', Defense Shield (ディフェンスシールド, ''Difensu Shīrudo''): Closes the cockpit in a bulletproof protective dome, like the original series.
*'''Button E''', Emergency Wire (エマージェンシーワイヤー, ''Emājyenshī Waiā''): Completely different from the original series, this shoots out a rope and grappling hook to snag objects, either to keep the Mach 5 from falling into dangerous situations, or to hoist itself out of them.
*'''Button F''', Fish Diver (フィッシュダイバー, ''Fisshu Daibā''): Functionally identical to Frogger Mode, but causes a [[M.A.S.K.]]-like physical transformation in the car, the wheels folding in and maneuverability fins sprouting.
*'''Button G''', Gallant Go (ギャラント号, ''Gyaranto Gō''): Again, identical to the Gizmo Rocket, but with a new name.  (The kanji 号 in its name is the same kanji used in the car's name, so the name literally means "The Gallant").<ref>'''Speed Racer X Episodes 1-34'''</ref>

==[[The New Adventures of Speed Racer]]==

The steering wheel of the Mach 5 in this series had eight unmarked rectangular buttons, arranged in two columns of four on either side of the steering wheel's center.  The car appeared to have the same functions as the Mach 5 in the original series, but the buttons Speed pressed to activate them seemed more or less random, with the same button activating different abilities (or different buttons activating the same ability) in different episodes.<ref>'''The new adventures of Speed Racer Episode one''' </ref>

==The Real Mach 5==

In 2000, a prototype Mach 5 with actual cutting blades was produced as a concept car.  100 production models were made in 2002 as a street legal vehicle.  Built on a 2001 Corvette Chassis, the body was extensively modified to look like the Mach 5. It had 345 horsepower, and cost between $75,000 and $125,000 each. {{cite web | title=Buy a Mach 5| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-10-01/buy-a-mach-5}}

==Portrayal in film==
[[Image:Mach5 Comic-Con2007.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Mach 5]] (shown on display at [[Comic-Con International]]) is the primary vehicle of Speed in ''Speed Racer''.  While it is designed to be driven, it will be hung from a crane for the film's scenes and have its effects be computer-generated.]]
{{main|Speed Racer (film)}}
The Mach 5 will be seen in the live-action film adaptation ''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]'', directed by the [[Wachowski brothers]], produced by [[Joel Silver]], and released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].  The Mach 5 will be an actual vehicle in the film.  Instead of being driven on pavement, it will be hung from a crane and have its effects [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]].<ref name="demon">{{cite news | author=Scott Bowles | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-05-30-speed-racer_N.htm | title=First look: 'Speed Racer's' demon on wheels | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=[[2007-05-31]] | accessdate=2007-05-31 }}</ref>

The steering wheel hub is still present on this version of the Mach 5.  Although most of the original functions of the car are still intact, some areactivated by different buttons. Others are abandoned completely and replaced with new functions.  The features that are still kept in this incarnation are:

*Auto Jacks
*Grip Tires
*Deflector 
*Rotary Saws
*Homing Robot

The functions abandoned in this version of the Mach 5 are:

*Frogger
*Illuminating Eye

The functions on this Mach 5 are:
(*)New functions are represented with '''''Bold Italics'''''. 

'''Control A''' = Jump Jacks

When pressed, the car releases and immediately retracts long automated car jacks that make the car jump over any hazardous obstacle.  The car also releases these jacks to boost it for any repairs and adjustments

'''Control B''' = Bullet-proof polymer deflector (D in the original)

When pressed, the car sprouts a bullet-and impact-proof shield that encloses the cockpit into an airtight chamber.

'''Control C''' = '''''Tire Shields''''' (Replaces Frogger function) 

When pressed the car sprouts shields from its tires to prevent tire damage from secret weapons of other racing competitors.  Speed can control the motion of the shields by remote control inside the cockpit.

'''Control D''' = '''''Hexodyne emergency spare tires''''' (Replaces Illuminating eye)

If a tire does get heavily damaged, this button causes it to regenerate.  This function applies to any of the Mach 5's four tires.

'''Control E''' = Zircon-tipped cutter blades (C in the original)

When pressed, the Mach 5 releases two rotary saws from the front of the car that can cut through almost anything.

'''Control F''' = Tire crampon grips (B in the original)

When pressed, the Mach 5 sprouts special spiked grip tires for traction over any kind of terrain (firm, icy, or unsteady ground; ocean floor; vertical mountainsides). 

'''Control G''' = Homing robot

When pressed, the Mach 5 releases a remote control robot bird capable of recording footage anywhere.

it appears in the trailer than a new vehical with a 6 on the side is driven by speed.possiably the "mach 6"
