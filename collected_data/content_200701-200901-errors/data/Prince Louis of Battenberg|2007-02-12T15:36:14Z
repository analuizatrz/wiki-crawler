[[Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Louis Alexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven''', [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] ([[24 May]] [[1854]] &ndash; [[11 September]] [[1921]]), formerly '''Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg''', was a minor [[Germany|German]] [[prince]] who married a granddaughter of Britain's [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and pursued a distinguished career in the United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]], eventually serving as [[Admiralty|First Sea Lord]] from 1912 to 1914. He was the father of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and of [[Louise Mountbatten|Queen Louise of Sweden]], and was the maternal grandfather of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], consort of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. One of his younger brothers, [[Alexander of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander of Battenberg]] ([[1857]]-[[1893]]), was selected with the approval of Europe's [[Power (international)|Great Powers]] to mount the throne of [[Bulgaria]], where he reigned as [[Prince|sovereign Prince]] from [[1879]] to [[1886]]. 

==Early life==
''His [[Illustrious Highness]] [[Count]] Louis (Ludwig) Alexander of [[Battenberg]]'' was born in Graz, [[Austria]], the eldest son of [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] ([[1823]]-[[1888]]) by his [[morganatic marriage]] to [[Count|Countess]] [[Julia von Hauke]] ([[1825]]-[[1895]]). Denied his father's [[dynastic]] rights and [[Royal and noble ranks|rank]] in [[Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse]], from birth he shared the countly title and "Illustrious" [[Honorific|style]] conferred upon his mother at the time of her marriage, automatically becoming ''[[Serene Highness|His Serene Highness]] Prince Louis of Battenberg'' when she was elevated to ''Princess of Battenberg'' with the style of ''Serene Highness'' by decree of her husband's brother, Grand Duke Ludwig III of Hesse and by Rhine on [[21 December]] [[1858]]. 

==Naval career==
Influenced by his cousin's wife, the future [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Grand Duchess Alice of Hesse]], a daughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s, Louis became a naturalized [[United Kingdom|British]] subject and joined the [[Royal Navy]] in 1868, at the age of fourteen. He began his career as a [[midshipman]] on the ''Royal Alfred'' where, despite his royal connections he was shown no favoritism. In [[1876]], he served in the ship which conducted the [[Prince of Wales]] on an official tour of [[India]], thereby becoming a protégé of his future king, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. During the [[1882]] Egyptian intervention, he served as a [[lieutenant]] on ''Inconstant'' and was decorated with the Egyptian Medal and the Khedive Bronze Star. In September 1883, Queen Victoria appointed him lieutenant in her yacht, ''Victoria and Albert,'' which assured his promotion to [[commander]] two years later. Prince Louis rose to the rank of [[captain]] and became an aide-de-camp to the Queen in [[1891]]. Although the Queen felt he was discriminated against because of his princely title and therefore occasionally intervened to promote his career, Louis welcomed battle assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that he was serious about his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours actually impeded his progress, but it would have been ungrateful as well as unwise to demur. He was promoted to [[Rear Admiral|rear admiral]] in [[1904]], [[Vice Admiral|vice admiral]] in [[1910]], and [[admiral]] in [[1912]]. During that time, he served as [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Director of Naval Intelligence]] (1902-1905), [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Atlantic Fleet (1908-1911), commander of the Third and Fourth Divisions of the Home Fleet (1911), and [[Second Sea Lord]] (1911). He became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (K.C.B.) in the military division in 1908, having received the K.C.B. and Knight Grand Cross (G.C.B.) in the civil division of the same order in 1884 and 1887, respectively. 

On [[9 December]] [[1912]], Prince Louis assumed the post of First Sea Lord, the senior uniformed officer in the Royal Navy. In that capacity, he was responsible to the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (at the time, [[Winston Churchill]]) for the readiness of the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy. On the eve of [[World War I]] he unilaterally made the crucial decision to cancel the scheduled dispersal of the British fleet following practice manoeuvres in order to preserve the Royal Navy's battle readiness, despite the fact that this was likely to be construed as a provocative act by Germany. Nonetheless, with the outbreak of the [[World War I|war]], rising anti-German sentiment among the British public, newspapers, and elite [[Gentlemen's club (traditional)|gentlemen's club]]s (where resentment was inflamed by Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]] despite Churchill's remonstrances) drove Churchill to ask Prince Louis to resign as [[First Sea Lord]] on [[29 October]] [[1914]]. He held no official post for the remainder of the war and, although assured that he would be returned to command post-war, he was asked to retire from the Navy's active list in 1918, which he did amidst an outpouring of appreciation from his naval comrades.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Marriage and Children==
On [[30 April]] [[1884]] in the presence of Queen Victoria, Prince Louis of Battenberg married [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]] ([[5 April]] [[1863]]-[[24 September]] [[1950]]) at [[Darmstadt]]. His wife was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria's second daughter [[Princess Alice of Great Britain and Ireland|Alice]] ([[26 April]] [[1843]]-[[14 December]] [[1878]]), by [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]] ([[12 September]] [[1837]]-[[13 March]] [[1892]]). Prince and Princess Louis of Battenberg were first cousins once removed and their marriage produced four children <sup>1</sup>:
*HSH Princess [[Princess Alice of Battenberg|Alice of Battenberg]] ([[15 February]] [[1885]]-[[5 December]] [[1969]]) m. HRH [[Prince Andrew of Greece|Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark]] ([[2 February]] [[1882]]-[[3 December]] [[1944]]). Among her children is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] 
*HSH Princess [[Louise Mountbatten|Louise of Battenberg]], later styled Lady Louise Mountbatten ([[13 July]] [[1889]]-[[2 March]] [[1965]]) m. Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, later King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]] ([[11 November]] [[1882]]-[[15 September]] [[1973]])
*HSH Prince [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven|George of Battenberg]], who became George Mountbatten, Earl of Medina in 1917, and succeeded his father as 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven in 1921, ([[6 November]] [[1892]]-[[4 April]] [[1938]]) m. [[Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven|Countess Nadejda (Nada) de Torby]] ([[28 March]] [[1896]]-[[22 January]] [[1963]]), [[Morganatic branches of the Russian Imperial Family|morganatic]] daughter of [[Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich Romanov|Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia]] by Countess Sophie von Merenberg, herself the daughter of a morganatic marriage between [[Prince]] Nicholas of [[Duke of Nassau|Nassau]] and Natalia Aleksandrovna Pushkin, daughter of [[Aleksandr Pushkin|Russia's most renowned author]], and great-granddaughter of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s African protégé, [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]]
*HSH Prince [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Francis of Battenberg]], later 1st Viscount Mountbatten of Burma and 1st [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] ([[25 June]] [[1900]]-[[August 27]] [[1979]]) m. Edwina Ashley ([[28 November]] [[1900]]-[[21 February]] [[1960]]), co-heiress of the vast banking fortune of her maternal grandfather, [[Ernest Cassel|Sir Ernest Cassel]]; daughter of Wilfred Ashley, later Lord Mount Temple; and male-line great-granddaughter of the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|7th Earl of Shaftesbury]].
*<sup>1</sup> In 1881, prior to his marriage, Prince Louis of Battenberg allegedly fathered an illegitimate daughter, [[Jeanne Marie Langtry Malcolm]], by actress [[Lillie Langtry]], also a one-time mistress of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], who was later acknowledged by Lord Mountbatten of Burma. As to whether Mountbatten was in fact the father has never been completely verified.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Adoption of the Surname Mountbatten==
Persistent rumors that the British Royal Family must be pro-German given their dynastic origins and many German relatives, prompted the King to abandon his subsidiary German dynastic titles and adopt an [[House of Windsor|English surname]]. At the behest of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], Louis relinquished the title Prince of Battenberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, as also the style of Serene Highness, on [[14 July]] [[1917]]. At the same time, Louis also anglicized his family name, changing it from "[[Battenberg family|Battenberg]]" to "[[Mountbatten]]," having considered but rejected "Battenhill" as an alternative. On [[17 July]], the king created him ''[[Marquess of Milford Haven]], Earl of Medina, and Viscount Alderney'' in the [[peerage of the United Kingdom]].[http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/archiveViewFrameSetup.asp?IssueNumber=30374&pageNumber=6&SearchFor=&PageDuplicate=n&selMedalType=&selHonourType=] The King's British relatives in the [[Teck]], [[House of Oldenburg|Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Gleichen]] families underwent similar changes. Louis's wife ceased to use her own title of Princess of Hesse and became known as the Marchioness of Milford Haven. His three younger children ceased to use their princely titles and assumed courtesy titles as children of a British marquess; his eldest daughter, Princess Alice, had married into the Greek royal family in [[1903]], and never had occasion to use the surname Mountbatten. However, her only son, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] of Greece and Denmark, adopted the name when he became a British subject in 1947.

While the transition in names and titles was being effected, Louis spent some time at the home of his eldest son, George. After anglicizing his surname to ''Mountbatten'' and becoming Marquess of Milford Haven, Prince Louis wrote in his son's guestbook, "Arrived Prince Jekyll, Departed Lord Hyde".{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Prince Louis' elder son, [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven|George Mountbatten]], who received the courtesy title Earl of Medina, succeeded him as 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven in [[1921]]. [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Prince Louis' younger son]], styled Lord Louis Mountbatten after [[1917]], was created Viscount Mountbatten of Burma in [[1946]] and then Earl Mountbatten of Burma and Baron Romsey in [[1947]]. He served as the last [[Viceroy of India]].

Lord Milford Haven was appointed a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and was promoted to the rank of Admiral of the Fleet in recognition of his service to the Royal Navy in August [[1921]]. He died in London on [[11 September]] [[1921]]. His remains were buried at Whippingham Church on the [[Isle of Wight]].

One of his younger brothers, [[Prince Henry of Battenberg]] ([[1858]]-[[1896]]), married [[Princess Beatrice, Princess Henry of Battenberg|Princess Beatrice]], the youngest child of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], and took up residence with the Queen in Britain so that his wife could continue to serve as her mother's companion and private secretary. His youngest brother, Prince Franz Joseph of Battenberg [[1861]]-[[1924]] earned a doctorate based on a dissertation about his brother's reign in Bulgaria, wed [[Royal Highness|HRH]] Princess Anna Petrović Njegoš [[1874]]-[[1971]] in [[1897]], a daughter of King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]], and took up residence in [[Switzerland]]. His only sister, Princess Marie, wed the head of a [[Mediatization|mediatized]] family, Count Gustaf zu Erbach-Schoenberg, who was elevated, along with the couple's male-line descendants, to [[Fürst|Prince]] and [[Serene Highness]] by her cousin, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], in 1903. Marie's memoirs have been published in German and English, and include an account of the family's visit to the ruins of the castle of Battenberg in Hesse. 

Of the family's two residences in Hesse, the Alexander Palace in Darmstadt returned to the grand duchy as part of the [[Appanage|appanaged]] patrimony of Louis's father, [[Alexander of Hesse-Darmstadt|Prince Alexander]], from which his children by Julie Hauke were debarred. However, the castle of Heiligenberg in Jugenheim had been bequeathed to Prince Alexander as personal property. During the 1870s, [[Maria Alexandrovna|Empress Marie Aleksandrovna]], née Princess of Hesse, brought her husband, [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], her numerous children and a large retinue for annual visits to her brother's little chateau at Heiligenberg, evoking visits from foreign kings, diplomats and matchmaking mothers eager to pay their respects to Russia's Emperor without having to actually travel all the way thither. Not only did these visits put the Hessian grandduchy "on the map", but they enhanced the prestige of the Battenbergs on the Continent. But joint possession of a German property by Louis and Henry in England with their Continental siblings during the Great War proved an untenable embarrassment, so it was sold.
