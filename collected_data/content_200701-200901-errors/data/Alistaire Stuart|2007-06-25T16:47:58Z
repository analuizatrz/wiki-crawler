'''Alistaire Stuart''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a scientist, an ally of the [[superhero]] team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and head of MI-13, an intelligence agency. He first appeared in ''Excalibur'' #6 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Alan Davis]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Doctor Alistaire Stuart''' and his sister, brigadier [[Alysande Stuart]] are the founders of the Weird Happenings Organisation (W.H.O.). The W.H.O. is a British intelligence agency to investigate paranormal and superhuman activity and combat any superhuman threats by combining Alistaire's scientific knowledge with Alysande's military skills. 

While investigating the disappearance of doctor [[Moira MacTaggert]] and the appearance of a Moira MacTaggert from a  [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], Alistaire meets [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]], a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], who is attracted to Alistaire. Kitty introduces Alistaire to Excalibur and to her disappointment, Alistaire is more interested in Kitty's friend [[Rachel Summers]]. Alistaire, Alysande and the W.H.O. become loyal allies to Excalibur. Alistaire's many visits with the team involve him in a few odd occurences at first, mainly concerning alternate realities somehow being connected to the lighthouse headquarters. Alistaire accompanies the team during their unwilling journey across parallel universes known as the ''Cross-Time Caper''. He shares the team's many adventures across dozens of realities, often finding time to take pictures. He finds time for a romance, helps out where he can and even killed, for a time, along with most of the team. The latter half of the 'Caper' is mentally draining on all of them, made even more so by the seeming loss of Kitty. Eventually the intervention of the vastly powerful [[Saturnyne]] allows the team to return home. Kitty is later discovered whole and healthy.

Alistaire becomes a trustworthy friend, visiting the team many times in their lighthouse headquarters. He is once entrusted with 'house' sitting when Excalibur must visit Limbo itself to save all of England. During this time he gets to meet the [[West Coast Avengers]].

Alistaire assists the team when they must battle the evil sorcerer [[Necrom]]. He becomes involved in the dimensional displacements taking place throughout the entirety of the team's headquarters, many of which manifest alternate versions of Alistaire himself. 

Alysande is later accused of selling classified information to 
[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], but she dies before the investigation is complete. She had been killed by Jaime Braddock, the evil brother of Captain Britain, who takes some time to defeat. S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]] meets Alistaire at the funeral and tells him that his sister was framed. Alistaire investigates the matter and finds out that the [[R.C.X.]], another government agency, framed Alysande so that W.H.O. is weakened and the R.C.X. can take control of its resources. R.C.X. personally kidnaps Alistaire, trying to bring him around to their point of view. It turns out R.C.X is basing it's power on dozens of super-powered children, who, together, are capable of many things, such as crafting a headquarters in days. A telepathic child, 'Beetroot', briefly shares a link with Alistaire, showing him how R.C.X mistreats and abuses it's charges. The child dies moments later and Alistaire, infuriated, lands a powerful punch right in Smythe's face. Even though the man was surrounded by super-human guards. Later, with the help of Excalibur the R.C.X. is defeated. 

Shortly afterwards, another intelligence agency, [[Black Air]] begins its rise to power. Black Air competes with the R.C.X. and W.H.O., often with violence. As leader of the W.H.O., Alistaire knows too much about Black Air and is targeted by them for assassination. He flees the country and travels to the United States. There, he makes his way to the [[X-Mansion]] and asks the [[X-Men]] to contact Excalibur. Meanwhile, Excalibur has had its own problems with Black Air and promises to bring Alistaire home. Excalibur uses the information they have gathered on Black Air to expose Black Air's crimes and Black Air is forced underground. Alistaire Stuart is appointed head of a new department to replace W.H.O., Black Air and the R.C.X. This new department is known as MI-13 or simply "the Department".

London became affected when the crime-lord Viper purchases several 'Murderworld' items from the killer [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]. Alistaire is called in to control the scene when it is confirmed that the [[London Eye]] has been rigged with two bombs and a nuclear explosive. The X-Men, having legal standing at the time, ignore Alistaire's orders to stand down. The nuclear bomb is removed and nuetralized. Afterwards, Alistaire removes his jacket and sits on a curb with the X-Men, discussing the situation.

As of March 2007, Alistaire Stuart has a supporting role in the miniseries Wisdom, which features British non-superhero [[Pete Wisdom]]. Though it has not been explained why, Stuart now appears to be a very old man.
