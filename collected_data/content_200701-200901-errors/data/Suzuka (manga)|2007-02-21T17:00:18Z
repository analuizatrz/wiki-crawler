She is a serious athlete that puts a lot of pressure on her self to perform so she does not disappoint others. At first she mostly has a cold attitude toward Yamato, but according to her sister, Suzuka only shows her arrogant and somewhat moody attitude to someone she likes. <ref name="S1"> "Suzuka" Manga; volume 9 [[tankōbon]] (Chapter 78, Page 124). </ref> Because of her past with Kazuki, she was reluctant to express her feeling toward Yamato and ended up trying to push him away. After awhile she finally admits to herself and to Yamato that she has liked him since the first time they met and they begin dating. Their relationship was rocky from the start because of Yamato’s carelessness and Suzuka guarded attitude to her thoughts and feelings. She decides to take the [[study abroad]] offer by Sasoka, claiming the training standards are higher and she will benefit more, but Yui believes that Suzuka has another reason. Before leaving for the United States, for reasons only known to her, she decided to break up with Yamato. After the time-skip, Suzuka moved back into her room next door to Yamato. She, like Yamato, has been recommended to Seijo University which she plans on attending. During a grocery run with Yamato, she revealed the reason she took the study abroad offer is because he complimented her on how cool she looked during her high-jump. After Yamato told her that he still liked her, she did her best to avoid him. After he apologized for his selfishness, she told him that she was happy that he still felt the same way about her, but she can not go out with him. The reason she wants to only remain friends with Yamato is because she is afraid that if they date again, they will begin to hate each other and drift apart. Yamoto, however, refuses to accept this as a reason for them to break up and asks Suzuka to believe in him more after a forced hug. Angered and confused Suzuka begins to storm off, only to turn back and demand Yamato to chase after her.
