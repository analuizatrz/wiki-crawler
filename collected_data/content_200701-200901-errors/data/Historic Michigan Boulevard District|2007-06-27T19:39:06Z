[[Image:Chicago Skyline Hi-Res.jpg|thumb|right|800px|The historic district begins immediately south of the [[Smurfit-Stone Building]].]]

The '''Historic Michigan Boulevard District''' is a historic district in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]] encompassing [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] between 11th (1100 south in the street numbering system) and Randolph Streets (150 north).<ref name=CL>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/M/MichBlvd.html|title=Historic Michigan Boulevard District|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|date=2003|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref><ref name=SC>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6.</ref><ref>Emporis claims this district extends to Randolph street which is 1200 South.</ref> It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on [[February 27]] [[2002]].<ref name=CL/> The district includes numerous significant buildings on Michigan Avenue facing [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]].<ref name=EMP>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100014|accessdate=2007-05-31|date=2007|title=Michigan Avenue Landmark District|publisher=Emporis}}</ref>  In addition, Michigan Avenue is recognized as the end of [[U.S. Route 66]]. Michigan Avenue is named for [[Lake Michigan]], which it once ran alongside at 100 east in the city's street numbering system until [[landfill]] for Grant Park (then Lake Park) pushed the shoreline east.<ref>Hayner and McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "Michigan Avenue", p. 87.</ref> Within this district, it is one of the world's most well known one-sided streets rivalling [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]] and [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Princes Street]].<ref name=CL/> This feature is due in large part to the legal battles of [[Aaron Montgomery Ward]] with the city over cleaning up the park and removing most of the structures in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/538.html|title=Grant Park|accessdate=2007-06-02|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  Eventually, Ward's ideas were adopted by [[Daniel Burnham]] in his [[Plan of Chicago]], which called for "insured light, air, and an agreeable outlook" along the Grant Park street frontage.<ref name=CLBMT/>  The preservation of the lakefront view has inspired architects to create a architectural cornucopia of designs along the "streetwall".

At no point is Michigan Avenue currently a [[Boulevard]], but prior to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, the street was officially known as Michigan Boulevard and often referred to as "Boul Mich".<ref name=CLBMT>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/Tours/BoulMich.html|title=Boul Mich Tour|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|date=2003|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> As recently as the 1920s, North Michigan Avenue (especially the [[Magnificent Mile]]) was referred to as "Upper Boul Mich".<ref name=CNMAic>Stamper, John M., "Chicago's North Michigan Avenue," University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. ix, ISBN 0-226-77085-0.</ref>   [[Paris]]' [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]] is the original Boul Mich.

==Today==
Today the only building on the eastern side of Michigan Avenue in the Historic District is the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].  However, several interesting structures have been added to the northern part of the eastern side of Michigan Avenue in [[Millenium Park]] such as [[McCormick Tribune Plaza]]. The current "End Historic US 66" marker is now located along Michigan Avenue in this district to mark the official end of [[U.S. Route 66]] [[U.S. Route 66 in Illinois|in Illinois]].

Among the current issues today is the trend to redevelop properties by constructing grand towers behind the [[facade]]s of historic structures along Michigan and Wabash Avenues (the parallel street one block to the west). The most recent examples of this have been the [[The Heritage at Millennium Park]], the [[Legacy Tower|Legacy at Millennium Park]] and the 80-story tower proposed as part of the YWCA building redevelopment at 830 S. Michigan Avenue. This trend is now endangering the Chicago Athletic Association Annex, which has  been proposed for demolition to make way for a fifty- to eighty-story condominium tower across from [[Millennium Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarks.org/chicago_watch_2006_1.htm|accessdate=2007-05-31|title=Chicago Athletic Association Building and Annex|date=2007|publisher=Landmarks Illinois}}</ref> As a result, the building is listed first on the 2006-07 Chicagoland Watch List of the [[Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarks.org/chicago_watch.htm|accessdate=2007-05-31|title=Chicagoland Watch List 2006-07|date=2007|publisher=Landmarks Illinois}}</ref>
