[[Image:Floodforms library.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Halo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] encounters various flood forms on Alpha Halo.]]
The '''Flood''' is a fictional [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[parasite|parasitic]] life form in the [[Halo (video game series)|Halo]] video game series. They are introduced in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as a secondary enemy to the game's protagonist, [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], and return in ''[[Halo 2]]''. They are depicted as highly virulent and deadly, and can quickly incapacitate and infect their vectors. The Flood have appeared in three primary forms: '''Infection''', '''Combat''', and '''Carrier''' forms, but also have  forms such as the Brain form and the Juggernaut form which have not been fully explained or documented. All of these have an attraction to any lifeform of sufficient mass to accommodate them and will try to attack/infect any they encounter. 

The Flood made their first appearance in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sixth level, "343 Guilty Spark."<!-- The Flood is not a level, it's a chapter in 343 GS --> After reaching Halo's control room in the previous mission, Master Chief is sent by the AI [[Cortana]] to try and stop [[List_of_Halo_series_characters#Captain_Jacob_Keyes|Captain Jacob Keyes]] and his [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] Marines from reaching a weapons cache they believed was hidden in a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] structure by a swamp. In reality, the cache was false intelligence; instead of finding weapons, Keyes found that a sizable population of Flood was released from [[stasis]] by the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]]. The Flood quickly escape containment and spread across the ring, threatening not only Humanity and the Covenant, but the entire galaxy if they escape.

===Life Cycle===
In the game, the lifecycle of the Flood begins at the Infection form stage, as a small, frail, creature. These creatures leap upon a potential host and attempt to drive in three barbed tentacles (although the small spores that some Flood are seen to release are also used to either infect or incapacitate potential hosts, as [[343 Guilty Spark]] explains over in the level "The Library").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halosm.bungie.org/story/level_transcripts/lv07_library.html|title= ''Halo'' Story Page Level Transcripts|work=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=Mar 10|accessyear=2006}}</ref> From here, the host is paralyzed and loses consciousness. The infection form then bores itself deep into its host. For a while it plays with its new body, and over time it mutates it by changing hormones and replacing the host's nervous system with its own tentacles. The host is still conscious as it is being controlled, but is confined to its own mind. However, if a host is infected by a Flood infection form with its ability to enslave the host weakened (Private Wallace A. Jenkins encountered this rare dysfunction in the novel ''[[Halo: The Flood]]''), the host may be able to reassert some control over its badly mutated and damaged body, provided the Flood host retreats from the host's mind temporarily. Also, if a host has sufficient will power (e.g. [[Captain Jacob Keyes]]), the host can fight against the Flood's invasion of their mind, and keep it from gaining access to certain parts of the mind (In the case of Capt. Keyes, he was able to keep the Flood from invading the part of his mind containing information about Earth). In the video games, the host is seen carelessly treated, with infected limbs, rotting organs, and the neck of the host broken. The disused head of the victim can be destroyed without causing the Flood form pause, and hordes of Flood will attack the player without regard to casualties. If the host is of suitable size, long whip-like tentacles emerge from the arms as weapons. If not of suitable size or sufficiently damaged to prevent effective use in combat the next stage of mutation occurs. The body becomes bloated and rotten, while the upper body swells. Smaller Infection forms grow within this ball of flesh, as it swells with gas and diseased innards. When the Carrier Form detects a suitable host in their proximity, they explode, releasing the Infection forms inside to continue the cycle.<ref>''Official Strategy Guide: Halo 2'' pp 120-123.</ref>

===Origins===
{{seealso|Forerunners (Halo)}}
The origins of the Flood have never been fully explained. In ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' the player learns that the ring they are playing on, [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]], was built by the [[Forerunners (Halo)|Forerunners]] to contain the Flood, as well as being a weapon of last resort if the Flood were to escape. The Forerunners were eventually forced to activate [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]] to prevent the galaxy-wide spread of the Flood, killing themselves and most other sentient life at the time. The origin of the Flood has never been fully explained by the ''Halo'' games or books, their history lost in the time passed since their inception and their discovery in ''Halo''. 343 Guilty Spark mentions that the Flood actually terraform the atmosphere to suit them:<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark:''' Your environment suit should serve you well when the Flood begins to alter the atmosphere. You are a good planner.{{cite video game

According to what the AI character [[Cortana]] discovers during ''Halo'', the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] constructed research facilities situated over gas giants and later huge "Fortress World" installations (called "Halos" by the Covenant) to contain and study the Flood. In the event that the Flood was released and all other strategic possibilities were exhausted, the Halos were designed to destroy all sentient life in the galaxy; In ''Halo 2'' the character Guilty Spark states that the Halo system was fired at least once, killing all intelligent life—including the Forerunners—as planned.<ref>  '''343 Guilty Spark:''' After exhausting every other strategic option, my creators activated the rings.

===Game Development===
The Flood were added later in the game development stage of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', after the game had made its jump from the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform and Bungie was bought by Microsoft. At one point, the ringworld ''Halo'' featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but due to gameplay constraints, these were dropped. An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904|title=One Million Years B.X.|work=bungie.net|accessdate=Jan 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Flood forms==
[[Image:Flood3.jpg|thumb|200px|Infection form]]
===Infection forms=== 
The infection forms are small creatures which use tentacles for mobility and infection. They appear to have their own defined biological framework, as in the games they are seen without a host and do not appear to need one to survive. Individually they are weak and fragile; in the game they usually appear (and attack) in large swarms. The infection forms will seek out any sentient life of sufficient [[Biomass (ecology)|bio-mass]] and [[calcium]] deposits to sustain itself, and proceed to attempt to use the creature as a host, by burrowing into the thoracic cavity, tapping into the spinal/nervous system, suppressing the host's consciousness, and releasing spores which cause the host to mutate.<ref name=haloflood>See the novel ''[[Halo: The Flood]]''</ref> 343 Guilty Spark mentions these "spores."<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark:''' You can see how the body's been transformed by the genetic restructuring of the Flood infection. The small creatures carry spores that cause a host to mutate. The mutated host then produces spores that can pass the Flood to others.  {{cite video game

| publisher = Microsoft
| date = 2001

| version = 
| level = The Library

}}</ref> At this point, the infected creature mutates into one of three possible forms. 

In the games, the infection form cannot attach to a host if the host is protected by a personal energy shield; contact with the shield will make them explode with a distinct "pop" sound and will have a minimal effect on the shield's strength. However, if several dozen try to attack a shielded host they will gradually deplete their shields to the point that they are vulnerable. Thus, soldiers such as the human SPARTAN soldiers and the [[The Covenant|Covenant]] [[Covenant_Elite|Elites]] have some protection against the Flood and may mount a counter-attack, but unshielded troops (the majority of both armies) such as [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] Marines and Covenant [[The Covenant (Halo)#Grunts|Grunts]], [[The Covenant (Halo)#Jackals,|Jackals]], [[The Covenant (Halo)#Brutes|Brutes]], and [[The Covenant (Halo)#Drones|Drones]] are highly susceptible to an attack by masses of infection forms. Brutes have not been seen infected, while the symbiotic communal nature of the Hunter makes them immune to infection.
===Combat forms===
[[Image:Flood Human.jpg|thumb|200px|Human Combat form]]
If the host is strong or deemed "useful" by the parasitic infection form, then the host will be converted into a warrior or worker form, used in defensive/offensive situations as well as maintaining and repairing machinery. 343 Guilty Spark remarks in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' that the Flood are busy repairing the ''Pillar of Autumn'', and in ''Halo 2'', the Flood have the ability to pilot and repair vehicles, suggesting that the Flood retain and utilize the memories and knowledge of their hosts.<ref name=haloflood /> The ''Halo'' novels also make reference to the Flood leeching the memories of their hosts to use equipment. These warrior or combat forms are extremely strong and agile and can jump to extreme distances and heights, with the [[The Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]] Elite-derived combat forms sometimes being able to use the energy shielding technology on their remaining Elite armour in ''Halo 2'', or the cloaking in the armory in the Maw level in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. However, the parasite form within the host is susceptible to gunfire and, if shot, completely disables the combat form until another infection form burrows into it and takes control.  These forms can use all [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] and Covenant weaponry, but are not seen using the Fuel Rod Gun (and in ''Halo'' they did not use sniper rifles). Combat Flood are also capable of unarmed combat, striking with whip-like tentacles protruding from the arms of the host. These tentacles can grow out of the arm at an alarming rate, simply breaking the nearby bones and displacing them. They also carry the grenades equipped before the host was infected, which are dropped when killed. Combat forms ignore any threat to themselves and those fighting alongside them and will often kill themselves to kill an opponent. The source of this reckless behaviour has never been identified, though because the Flood are intelligent—albeit not necessarily on an individual level—it is unlikely that the explanation for the wantonly violent ways of combat forms is quite as simple as a primitive drive to obtain food.

===Carrier forms===
[[Image:Carrier Flood.jpg|thumb|200px|Carrier Form]]
The third stage of the Flood cycle.  Carriers grow large sacs which contain several infection forms. When a carrier is in close proximity to any number of suitable hosts or is sufficiently damaged, it triggers a biochemical reaction which causes the sacs to explode and release the infection forms in order to infect more hosts. This continues the Flood life cycle. Carrier forms cannot physically attack; however, the explosion of a carrier form is roughly equivalent to a grenade detonation, killing any Flood or Covenant (aside from Hunters) within the blast radius. Loose [[grenades]] are also set off by a carrier form's explosion.  Carrier forms are hurled into the air by another's explosion; upon landing, they will themselves explode.

===Brain forms===
[[Image:Brainform Flood.jpg|thumb|200px|Captain Keyes, mutated into a Brain Form]]
Brain forms are large, spongy creatures resembling a large bag of flesh with tentacles. They are seen used in ''Halo: The Flood'' to collect important data, such as codes, planet locations, and information about the species that the Flood can infect. In ''Halo'', [[Captain Jacob Keyes]] was subjected to an 'interrogation' of sorts by one of these forms before finally being completely assimilated.<ref>'''Cortana:''' No human life signs detected. The Captain... he's one of ''them!'' {{cite video game
| title = Halo: Combat Evolved
| developer = Bungie Studios
| publisher = Microsoft
| date = 2001
| platform =
| version = 
| level = Keyes
| language = English
| isolang = 
| quote = 
}}</ref>

Over time, the brain form strips memories and information from its victims.  However, Keyes was able to resist giving the Flood information regarding the location of Earth when he realized that the Flood could not strip away information that he could draw from his neural implants, such as his name, rank, serial number, and the name of the ship that he commanded.  Thus by "feeding" the Flood that information, he could continue to access it and avoid giving the Flood more important information.<ref name=haloflood /> All body tissues and bones are soon reduced to fluid, and is digested as the brain slowly absorbs the information. A brainform is able to send information to other flood and send the data to the heart of the flood.

===Command forms===
The command forms, due to their limited exposure in the [[Halo (video game series)|Halo]] trilogy, are not well understood. Their purpose is not exactly known. [[Gravemind]] from Halo 2 is a command form over either all Flood or those on Installation 05 (Delta Halo). When the Flood invaded a Covenant supply ship in the story ''Last Voyages of the Infinite Succor'' they used corpses and dead biomatter to feed what appeared to be a much smaller, developing gravemind, which the Prophet Legate assumed to be a sort of central brain controlling the infestation.<ref>See the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]''</ref>

==Flood details==
It appears that the Flood cannot or will not infect already dead lifeforms, as one of the Marines in ''Halo'' evades the Flood by playing dead.<ref>'''Marine:''' Play dead! That's what I did... played dead. They took the live ones... {{cite video game
| title = Halo: Combat Evolved

| version = 
| level = 343 Guilty Spark
| language = English
| isolang = 
| quote = 
}}</ref> However the ability of infection forms to reanimate incapacitated Flood forms seems to suggest that once the initial infection has already occurred and been completed, a new Infection form can quickly take control of the corpse. The Flood have been noted to gather corpses for use in the construction of command or brain forms, however.<ref>'''Cortana:''' Look, over there. They're gathering bodies... {{cite video game
| title = Halo: Combat Evolved
| developer = Bungie Studios
| publisher = Microsoft
| date = 2001

| quote = 
}}</ref>

The remaining Flood on Installation 04 were destroyed due to the player's actions preceeding and during the detonation of the ''Pillar of Autumn'' 's engines in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', but in ''Halo 2'' they returned, with the ability to operate in-game vehicles. In ''Halo 2'', the Flood are led by the command form [[Gravemind#The Gravemind|Gravemind]], a massive creature that dwells beneath [[Delta Halo]]'s Library and on [[High Charity]]. It is not currently known if there is a command form with Gravemind's abilities in each ''Halo'', or if the command form Gravemind encountered on Delta Halo is unique.

One interesting note about fighting against Flood lifeforms is that human weapons (and the Sentinel Beam from Halo 2) seem to be superior in effectiveness, save for the Sniper Rifle (whose high-calibur rounds pass straight through a Flood's soft, squishy body, doing little more than annoying it).  Also, in Halo 2, some of the Flood can be seen using vehicles, such as the Scorpion tanks and the Covenant's Ghost hovercrafts. Flood hosts have two main weaknesses; the spot were the parasite entered is a vulnerable spot, and a host with no arms is considered useless. The weak spot can be exploited by a projectile weapon, (E.G the M6D or M6C pistol) and good aim. An incapacitated host's arms are vulnerable; a few shots on each will dispatch them, and any flood parasite that reanimates it soon finds it useless.
