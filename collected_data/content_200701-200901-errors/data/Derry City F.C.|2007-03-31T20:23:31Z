'''Derry City Football Club''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: '''''An Cumann Peile Chathair Dhoire''''') are an Irish [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in the city of [[Derry]]. The club plays in the 12-teamed [[FAI Premiership]] (the top tier) of the [[FAI National League]]. It is the only club in the league from [[Northern Ireland]] as opposed to the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The club, founded in 1928, plays its home matches at the [[Brandywell Stadium]]. Derry's colours are red and white in a vertically striped pattern and the club has been given the nickname, the ''Candystripes'', as a result. Others may refer to the club as the ''Red and White Army'', just ''Derry'', or simply, ''City''.

==History==
{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}

{{dablink|For further details on this topic, see: [[History of Derry City F.C.]]}}
Derry City were founded in 1928 and were granted entry into the [[Irish League]] in 1929. [[Joe McCleery]] was appointed the club's first manager and the [[Derry City Council|Londonderry Corporation]] was approached for the use of the [[Brandywell Stadium]], which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. This began an association between the club and the ground which has survived until the present day.

Having won the North-West Senior Cup in 1931-32, 1932-33, and 1933-34 the club went a step further the following year and lifted the [[City Cup]]. Derry were to repeat this feat in 1937 but it was not until 12 years after that that they would lift another major trophy. It was then in 1949 that the club won the [[Irish Cup]] for the first time, beating {{fc|Glentoran}} in the final.<ref>"[http://derrycityfc.net/history/legends/ifa1949.php The Great Cup Breakthrough]", ''CityWeb'', 2007.</ref> Derry reached the final once more in 1954, where they eventually overcame Glentoran yet again. 

In 1964 Derry City lifted the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]] and the Irish Cup for a third time. [[Steaua Bucure≈üti]] beat Derry 5-1 on aggregate in the club's first ever European outing in the [[Cup Winners Cup]] the following year but the club made up for it by winning the 1964-65 Irish League season and going on to become the first Irish League team to win a European tie over two legs by beating [[Lyn Oslo|FK Lyn]] when, after losing 5-3 in [[Oslo]], they won 8-6 on aggregate during the subsequent season.<ref>"[http://derrycityfc.net/history/legends/fklyn65.php Derry City vs FK Lyn]", ''CityWeb'', 2007.</ref> The Second Round was not to come to the Brandywell, however, as the IFA prevented the use of the ground, using the excuse that the pitch was not up to standard, {{Fact|date=March 2007}} even though a game had been played there during the previous round. With [[sectarianism]] taking a foothold in Northern Ireland in the run-up to the advent of the [[The Troubles|Troubles]], Derry suspected that such motives may have been at play, {{Fact|date=March 2007}} due to the fact that Derry played in a mainly [[Catholic]] area and were supported largely by [[Irish nationalist|nationalists]], while the IFA represented a cultural focal point of [[Protestant]] [[Northern Ireland]]. Relations between Derry and the IFA quickly deteriorated.

While up until the late 1960s most teams' journey to the [[Brandywell]] would have been of little consequence, 1969 was the year in which the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|Civil Rights]] campaign against the province's government disintegrated into communal violence, ushering in 30 years of the [[The Troubles|Troubles]]. Despite the social and political turmoil of the day, on the field Derry still managed to perform as usual. The club also managed to make their way to the [[Irish Cup]] final in 1971, although they were beaten 3-0 by [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]]. Nevertheless, the locality surrounding the Brandywell saw some of the worst violence of the period. Because of the extreme disturbances, numerous clubs were reluctant to play matches there and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] ruled that the zone was unsafe. As a result, Derry City were forced to travel to the majority [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]] town of [[Coleraine]], which was over 30 miles away from home, in order to play their 'home' games at the [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|Showgrounds]]. This situation lasted until October 1972 when, faced with dwindling crowds (most Derry fans were unwilling to travel to Coleraine due to the political situation and the 40-minute journey) and dire finances, the club formally requested permission to return to the Brandywell. Despite an assessment by the security forces which concluded that the Brandywell was no more dangerous than any other ground in the league {{Fact|date=March 2007}} and the resulting lifting of the imposed ban, City's proposal fell by a single vote at the hands of their fellow [[Irish League]] teams who remained unwilling to travel there. On Friday [[13 October]], 1972, the following day, Derry withdrew from senior football devastated and feeling somewhat marginalised. Continuing in senior football without a ground was seen as unsustainable. Resignation from the league was the only option open to the club as they were effectively forced out. {{Fact|date=March 2007}}

The club lived on as a junior team during a period that became known as [[The Wilderness Years (Derry City F.C.)|the "wilderness years"]], plying their trade in the local Saturday Morning League to survive, whilst simultaneously seeking re-admission to the Irish League on a number of occasions over the next 13 years. Each time, the club nominated the Brandywell as its chosen home-ground but each time, the Irish League refused to re-admit them despite significant improvements in the overall security situation over the years. Suspecting that refusal was at least in part driven by underhand political and sectarian motives, {{Fact|date=March 2007}} and believing they would never gain re-admission to the Irish League, Derry decided to turn their attentions elsewhere.

Derry applied to join the rejuvinated [[Football League of Ireland]] (the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland's]] football league at the time) in 1985 with the Brandywell Stadium as their home ground. After discussions and debates over the viability of such a proposal, Derry were eventually welcomed into the league's new First Division for 1985, but only after special dispensation from the [[Irish Football Association]] and further permission from [[FIFA]]. Derry's first match in the League of Ireland was played at the [[Brandywell]] on [[08 September]], 1985. Derry beat [[Home Farm]] of [[Dublin]] by a score of 3-1 in the match.<ref>"[http://derrycityfc.net/history/legends/homefarm85.php Derry City 3 - 1 Home Farm]", ''CityWeb'', 2007.</ref> The game itself was actually played as part of the [[Football League of Ireland Cup|League Cup]]. The club went on to clinch the [[League of Ireland First Division Shield]] in their first season of football in the [[Republic of Ireland]] with a 6-1 aggregate victory over [[Longford Town FC]] in the final.<ref>"[http://derrycityfc.net/history/legends/shield86.php Historic Shield Victory for City]", ''CityWeb'', 2007.</ref> The following season, Derry left [[Shelbourne F.C.]] in their wake as they won the First Division and promotion to the Premier Division simultaneously in 1987.<ref>"[http://derrycityfc.net/history/legends/first87.php First League Title in LOI]", ''CityWeb'', 2007.</ref> Derry have stayed in the top flight ever since.

Buoyed by the support of enthusiastic crowds flocking to the Brandywell after having being deprived of local senior football for such a lengthy period in their lives, and fuelled by hunger after an [[FAI Cup]] final defeat in 1988 to {{fc|Dundalk}}, [[Jim McLaughlin (football manager)|Jim McLaughlin]] helped the club to an historic [[the Treble|treble]] - the [[FAI League Cup|League Cup]], the [[Football League of Ireland|League Title]] and the [[FAI Cup]] - in the 1988-89 season. As a result, Derry qualified for the [[European Cup]] and past-winners, [[Benfica]], were drawn to come and play at the Brandywell in the following season's First Round of the European Cup.
 
Since the historic 1989 season, Derry have only won the League championship once in 1996-97, but have been runners-up on several occasions - in the 1994-95, 2005 and 2006 seasons. They also added three more FAI Cups to their trophy-tally in 1995, 2002 and 2006. In 1994 and 1997 they were runners-up in the FAI Cup. The [[FAI League Cup]] competition has also brought Derry much success - they won the trophy in 1991, 1992, 1994, 2000, 2005 and 2006, as well as in the 1989 treble-winning season. 
[[Image:Beckettbarca.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Beckett]] in action for Derry City against [[F.C. Barcelona]] at the [[Brandywell]] in 2003.]]
Despite the club's successes, though, Derry City's path has not always been a smooth one. In September, 2000, the club was in a crippled position from a financial perspective and on the verge of bankruptcy due to an unpaid tax bill. A huge effort was undertaken by local famous faces and the people of the city to keep the club alive. Martin O'Neill, then manager of Scottish giants, {{fc|Celtic}}, announced he would bring his side to the [[Brandywell]] in order to help raise funds for the beleagured club while a number of other fund-raising projects were also put together to help pay of the debts. Local band, the [[Undertones]], played a benefit concert on [[29 September]], door-to-door collections took place around the city, while [[Phil Coulter]], a singer from the city, hosted a golf classic on [[27 September]].<ref>"[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2000/0907/soccer11.html Derry City defeated Bohemians tonight in unusual circumstances]", ''Johnny Proby, RT√â.ie'', [[7 September]], 2000.</ref> Significantly, Derry-born politician [[John Hume]], then a [[Member of the European Parliament]] for the local constituency, also helped by using his contacts in the [[European Parliament|parliament]] along with his powers of persuasion to convince a number of former [[European Cup]] winners to come to the Brandywell and play friendly matches to raise funds through gate receipts and save the club from extinction.<ref>"[http://www.derrycity.gov.uk/Press%20Releases/110803-barca.htm City welcomes arrival of Barcelona team]", ''Derry City Council Press Release'', [[11 August]], 2003.</ref> [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]],<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/bbc_pundits/2368247.stm The belief of Derry]", ''Lyle Jackson, BBC Sport Online'', [[28 October]], 2002.</ref> [[FC Barcelona]]<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/football/3140737.stm Busy Derry take on Barca]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[12 August]], 2003.</ref> and [[Real Madrid]],<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/northern_ireland/1457149.stm The Real thing for Derry City]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[25 July]], 2001.</ref> as well as Celtic, all visited [[Derry]] with star-studded teams between then and 2003 in order to help the club survive. The game against Barcelona is fondly remembered on the Brandywell terraces as the day that firm fan-favourite and club legend, [[Liam Coyle]] left the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] club's [[Carles Puyol]] "on his arse" as he utilised his trickery to beat the defender.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/3145787.stm Barcelona treat Derry crowd]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[12 August]], 2003.</ref>

The money brought through the turnstiles helped to keep the club in operation, but just about, as results on the field continued to worsen under [[Gavin Dykes]]. Although the club has indeed never been relegated - something which would have been a financial nightmare for the club and most probably the final nail in the coffin at that particular time - in 2003 it came within a whisker of losing its long-established place in the Premier Division after finishing in ninth position and having to contest a two-legged relegation/promotion play-off with local [[Donegal]] rivals, [[Finn Harps]], who had finished second in that season's First Division. However, Derry won the game 2-1 on aggregate after extra-time in the Brandywell and remained in the top-flight. The second leg of the fixture was the last game ever that veteran and club legend, [[Liam Coyle]], played for the club as he announced his retirement soon afterward.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/3402383.stm Derry legend Coyle retires]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[16 January]] 2004.</ref> 

Fortunes began to improve for the club when team-captain, [[Peter Hutton]], took the role of player-manager for a temporary period in 2004 before the appointment of [[Stephen Kenny (football)|Stephen Kenny]]. The club also became the first club in Ireland to be awarded a premier UEFA licence that year.<ref>"[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2004/0228/uefalicences.html First Premier licence is awarded]", ''Mark O'Neill-Cummins, RT√â.ie'', [[28 February]], 2004.</ref> The subsequent appointment of Kenny as manager along wih the introduction of full-time football by the club helped to blossom positive results and the club soon began to regain past form with progressive momentum. In 2005, Kenny's first full season in charge, the club finished in second position in the league. This allowed them to enter the preliminary rounds of the 2006-07 [[UEFA Cup]]. The staggering progress of the club on this stage in the following season proved just how far Derry City had come. The club reached the First Round of the competition, having disposed of both [[IFK G√∂teborg]] and [[Gretna F.C.]], where they managed a home-draw with [[Paris Saint-Germain]] before going out by a 2-0 scoreline in the away-leg. Derry City's FAI League Cup victory in 2005 also saw the club qualify for the second ever cross-border [[Setanta Cup]] in 2006. The creation of this tournament in 2005 was greatly aided by the lessening of sectarian tensions on the island of [[Ireland]] as a whole due to the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]. For the first time since their withdrawal from the Irish League in the early 1970s, Derry City hosted competitive matches against {{fc|Linfield}} and {{fc|Glentoran}} - teams with largely [[unionist]] fanbases. 
[[Image:IMG 0161.jpg|350px|thumb|The Derry City team lined up prior to their game with [[Sligo Rovers]] in the 2006 [[FAI Cup]] semi-final at the [[Showgrounds]], [[Sligo]] on [[29 October]].]]
Despite the encouraging progress, on [[10 November]], [[2006]] manager [[Stephen Kenny]] announced he would be leaving the club to join Scottish side [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.]] at the end of the 2006 season in order to further his career. His success at Derry had raised eye-brows across the water, and especially in [[Scotland]], after the club's 5-1 demolition of [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]] on Scottish soil in the UEFA Cup. Kenny took up his position in Dunfermline on 18 November, which was the day after Derry City's last league game against Cork City at the Brandywell - a game which Derry won 1-0 to finish second in the league to {{fc|Shelbourne}} on goal-difference. However, Kenny's last game at the helm for Derry was when he returned from Dunfermline in an 'advisory role' for the [[Lansdowne Road]] encounter with [[St. Patrick's Athletic]] in the FAI Cup final. The game was a positive send-off for him after Derry came back from being a goal down on three separate occasions and clinched the game with a 4-3 scoreline after extra time. With the club having won the FAI League Cup earlier in the season (for the second year running), in as equally dramatic fashion (the game went to penalties after Derry had been reduced to 9 men),<ref>"[http://www.irishfootballonline.com/news_story.php?newsid=5402 Jennings the hero as Derry retain League Cup]", ''Irish Football Online'', [[18 September]], 2006.</ref> the claiming of the FAI Cup amounted to a cup double for the team. The cup-win could easily have concluded an historic second treble-winning season with the title-race having been so close. With the 2006 success, Derry City qualified for the 2007 [[Setanta Cup]].

After a period of much speculation and rumour succeeding Kenny's departure, [[Pat Fenlon]] was finally appointed as manager of Derry City on [[08 December]], [[2006]] for a three-year long contract to fill the void left by former boss, [[Stephen Kenny]].<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/6162985.stm Fenlon is new Candystripes boss]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[8 December]] 2006. Retrieved [[8 December]] 2006.</ref> He is Derry's twelfth manager since the club joined the [[League of Ireland]]. Days later, on [[12 December]], [[2006]], it was announced that Derry City had not only been accepted into the new-look [[FAI Premiership]] for the 2007 season, but had scored the highest number of points between those teams accepted - 830 - for on-field and off-field criteria determined by the [[FAI]]'s Independent Assessment Group. Fenlon's reign began with a win in his first competitive game against Glentoran in the [[Setanta Cup]] on [[26 February]], 2007.

==Colours and crest==
:''For further details on the club's traditions and historical development of the club's symbols, see: [[Traditions of Derry City F.C.]]

Derry City's traditional red and white "candystripes" with black shorts were introduced at the beginning of the 1934-35 season. The arrangement derived from an early connection with [[Sheffield United]], who wore (and still do wear) the identical pattern. Specifically, the colour-change should be attributed to [[Billy Gillespie]]. Gillespie, a native of nearby [[Donegal]], played for Sheffield United over a twenty-year period from 1913 until 1932, and scored over 137 league and cup goals in 492 games for the [[South Yorkshire]] side, as well as captaining them to [[FA Cup]] success in 1925. He was the club's most capped player with 25 for [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] and had started out with [[Derry Celtic]] before embarking on a career across the [[Irish Sea]]. The man was held in such high regard in his home country that when he left United in 1932 to replace [[Joe McCleery]] as manager of Derry City, the club changed their strip to red and white stripes within two years of his arrival in reverence to him and his time at [[the Blades]].

The club's current crest was unveiled at [[Lansdowne Road]] in 1997 when Derry City played [[Celtic F.C|Celtic]] in a pre-season tournament. The modern crest features a centred football, the club's name and the year of founding. The famous red and white candystripes are present along with a red mass of colour filling the left half of the crest, separated from the right by a white stripe. Known cultural landmarks or items associated with the city are absent from the badge. The origins of this crest are not fully known and the reason for the change in 1997 has never been explained by the club, although it is likely that the club simply wished to develop a fresh, contemporary image with a [[minimalist]] design.

==Home ground==
{{Merge|Brandywell Stadium|date=March 2007}}
:''See [[Brandywell Stadium]] for further information.''
[[Image:Brandywell.jpg||right|thumb|400px|[[Brandywell Stadium|The Brandywell]]; home ground of Derry City.]]
Derry City's home ground is the [[Brandywell Stadium]] situated on the Lone Moor Road just south-west of the [[Bogside]] in the Brandywell area of [[Derry]]. It is more commonly referred to as simply, the 'Brandywell'. The stadium is also a local [[greyhound racing]] venue, with an ovoid running track encircling the football pitch. The dimensions of the pitch itself measure 111 yards in length by 72 yards in width. The grounds, as well as the stadium, feature a large grass training area and club house, from which the club and ticket offices operate. The legal owner of the stadium is the [[Derry City Council]], which, under licence, permits Derry City to make use of the grounds for training, matches and the running of its various other club affairs, such as administration and a retail outlet. 

Plans of Derry's to purchase a pitch ran aground after their formation due to the tight timescale between their birth in 1928 and the season's beginning in 1929 and so the [[Derry City Council|Londonderry Corporation]] (now known as the Derry City Council) was approached for the use of the Brandywell Stadium which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. This began an association between the club and the ground which has survived until the present day. The club are still operating under the constraints of [[The Honourable The Irish Society|the Honourable the Irish Society]] charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community. In effect, the club do not have private ownership over the ground and, thus, cannot develop it by their own accord with that discretion being left to the Derry City Council. 

Derry City's first game at the Brandywell was against {{fc|Glentoran}} on [[22 August]], 1929. In 1933, the purchase of another ground was mentioned. The board decided not to buy Bond‚Äôs Field in the Waterside, however, as it was thought to be too far away from the fanbase which had built up on the Cityside, especially in the Brandywell area. They had first option on Derry Celtic‚Äôs old ground, [[Celtic Park (Derry)|Celtic Park]], but hesitated on a final decision and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] bought it ten years later. They also decided against buying Meenan Park for ¬£1,500. The club, thus, remained playing in the Brandywell.

Because of [[Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland's]] extremely volatile political situation during the era of the '[[Troubles]]' and past security fears for [[Protestants]] and those of the [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]] tradition visiting the mainly [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] city of [[Derry]], the [[Brandywell]] has not always been the home ground of Derry City. In 1970 and 1971, Derry had to play their 'home' ties against [[Linfield FC]] at [[Windsor Park]] in [[Belfast]] - the home-ground of [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] themselves. Similarly, from September 1971 until October 1972 Derry were forced to play all their 'home' games at the [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|Showgrounds]] in the town of [[Coleraine]], over 30 miles away, as police ruled the area surrounding the [[Brandywell]] was too unsafe for visitors from the other community. The [[Brandywell]] did not see senior football for another 13 years as the [[Irish Football League]] upheld a ban on the stadium and Derry decided to leave the league as a result. Only greyhound meetings and junior football were held at the venue during this period. Derry's admission to the [[League of Ireland]] in 1985 saw a much-welcomed return of senior games, however.
[[Image:Derrycity2.jpg|left|thumb||300px|The Brandywell's 'New Stand' under floodlights.]]
Due to health and safety regulations the stadium has a seating capacity of 2,900 for European competitions, although it can accommodate 7,700 on a normal matchday including those both standing and seated.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/4775553.stm Brandywell gets seating increase]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[9 August]] 2006. Retrieved [[3 October]] 2006. </ref><ref>"[http://www.stadiumguide.com/brandywell.htm Brandywell Stadium]", ''The Stadium Guide''. Retrieved [[3 October]] 2006.</ref> The [[Brandywell]] has undergone large-scale redevelopment is recent years with the 'New Stand' being constructed in 1991 and the 'Jungle' being demolished in 2004. The 'Jungle' section was the home of Derry's noisier hardcore element of fans. Many of these fanatics now occupy the area of and surrounding Block J in the 'New Stand'. The quieter blocks of the 'New Stand', where the remainder of the more-reserved spectators sit, are sometimes referred to by the louder group as 'the Library' in jest.

Furthermore, the stadium saw the construction of 450 extra seats opposite the 'New Stand' on the site of the old 'Jungle' to complement the pre-existing Glentoran Stand on that side of the stadium as well as the development of a drug-testing facility in August 2006 in order to cope with the demand for Derry's [[UEFA Cup]] Second Qualifying Round tie with Gretna. This development is set to continue with the building of the proposed Brandywell Complex as planned by Brandywell Properties Limited, who act on behalf of the club. Plans for the complex include a 7,000 all-seater stadium (which will be expandable), new playing and training pitches, an indoor football complex, two retail units, a medical centre and a pharmacy. There are, however, no plans under the current proposals, to include a dog-racing track. [[Image:Derry Fans in New Stand.JPG|thumb|330px|The Brandywell on match-day.]]The cost of this development, which it is hoped will be completed by 2012, is reportedly ¬£15 million.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/5085378.stm Brandywell revamp plan unveiled]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[15 June]] 2006. Retrieved [[1 October]] 2006. </ref> Work on the new complex was planned to begin by Spring 2007. The need for new stadium facilities has never been so obvious as it is now with the old side of the stadium becoming noticably more run-down by the season. However, as the [[Derry City Council]] own the land, they ultimately hold the key to the proceeding of any planned development.<ref>"[http://www.eleven-a-side.com/premier/irish_soccer_detail.asp?newsid=16140 Derry fans make stadium plea]", ''Eleven-a-side.com'', [[22 February]], 2005.</ref> 

While an alternative idea of building a new multi-purpose stadium for the city (which would also provide a new home for Derry City FC) on the site of a dismantled [[British Army]] post at the city's Fort George has also been aired due to delays in the process, on [[12 January]], 2007, financial advisor and former [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] president, [[Peter Quinn (GAA President)|Peter Quinn]], who played a pivotal role in securing funding for the re-development of the modern-day [[Croke Park]], was appointed as a consultant by Brandywell Properties to spearhead the club's bid to take over the re-development of the Brandywell Stadium and help the plan progress.<ref>"[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/northwest-edition/daily/article2146354.ece Big name to help City's bid for stadium]", ''Belfast Telegraph'', [[12 January]], 2007.</ref> On behalf of Brandywell Properties he is to seek funding from both the [[Irish government|Irish]] and [[British government|British]] governments, as well as injections from the [[National Lottery]] along with sums from other sporting agencies in order to help raise the ¬£15 million needed. The proposals will eventually be submitted to the [[British government|Government]], as well the Derry City Council.

On [[19 February]], 2007, the chairman of Brandywell Properties, Jack McCauley, a former chairman of Derry City, re-iterated the intention of focusing on the Brandywell Stadium for re-development and made it clear that the club's traditional home at the Brandywell "was the only show in town" as far as the football club was concerned. He also expressed how he was "amazed and surprised" that options such as the Templemore Sports Complex and Fort George were actually talked of being available.<ref>"[http://www.derryjournal.com/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=3422&ArticleID=2060503 There's only one show in town! - Insist Brandywell Properties Trust]", ''Arthur Duffy, Derry Journal'', [[20 February]], 2007.</ref>

The current Brandywell stadium has played host to many notable matches for Derry City, such as the 1-0 defeat of [[IFK G√∂teborg]] on [[27 July]], [[2006]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] First Qualifying Round. However, current facilities for spectators and media simply cannot cope with the demand for some matches. The ground also hosted the FAI League Cup final in 2006 between Derry and [[Dublin]] rivals, [[Shelbourne FC]]. Derry won the climactic game after it went to a penalty shoot-out.

By Irish footballing standards, Derry City have a relatively large and deeply loyal fan-base. Upon the club's entry into the [[Football League of Ireland|League of Ireland]] in 1985, crowds of 10,000 regularly flocked to the [[Brandywell]] to see their team. The "red and white army", as they are known in reference to the club's red and white colours, are regarded as being one of the largest, noisiest and most colourful groups following a team in the [[eircom League]].<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4782159.stm Kenny elated after Derry triumph]", ''BBC Sport Online'', [[10 August]] 2006.</ref><ref>"[http://youtube.com/watch?v=ekxNmenzoY4 Video recording of Derry City fans during their club's FAI Cup semi-final tie away to Sligo Rovers]", ''YouTube'', [[29 October]], 2006.</ref> Derry's average home attendance of 3,127 was the highest of any league team for the 2006 season and they are known to bring substantial numbers to away games, despite their isolation in the north-west. Furthermore, the highest attendance in the Premier Division was the last-night-of-the-season meeting between Derry City and {{fc|Cork City}} at the [[Brandywell]] on Friday [[17 November]] when 6,080 watched Derry exact some measure of revenge for their defeat in the reverse of the fixture the season before (which incidentally was also the highest attendance in 2005). Derry's supporters gave their team remarkable support in the club's [[UEFA Cup]] run during the 2006 season - around 3,000 travelled to [[Motherwell]] to see Derry beat {{fc|Gretna}} 5-1 in [[Fir Park]], while over 2,000 made their way to [[Paris]] to see their team play [[Paris Saint-Germain FC|PSG]] in the [[Parc des Princes]].
[[Image:DCFCPSG.jpg|thumb|400px|Derry City's fans in the [[Parc des Princes]], [[Paris]] on [[28 September]], 2006.]]
The club is renowned for its warm, close-knit, community spirit and the supporters have played a pivotal role in the survival and successes of the club over the years. When massive debts brought Derry close to extinction in the 2000-01 season, the local community responded en masse and saved the club. During the club's successful 2006 season, club legend, [[Peter Hutton]] said:
{{cquote|Nobody owns Derry City FC, apart from the people of Derry. Five or six years ago the club was on its knees, on the verge of going out of business. There was no sugar-daddy, no millionaire, no [[Roman Abramovich]] to save the club. It was the people and the city who saved the club. People, fans, ordinary people; they went out and banged on doors to collect money, they went around pubs with collection buckets, they did what they could to keep the club alive. Derry is a close-knit place, a small community, they care about their club and that's why we still have a club. And every bit of success we may get this season is down to them.<ref>"[http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=134217728/newsid=457048.html Derry dare to dream]", ''Aidan Fitzmaurice, UEFA.com'', [[15 September]], 2006.</ref>}}

Support for the club, although quite dependent on geography, crosses numerous social boundaries. Many fans reside in [[working class]] areas, such as the nearby Brandywell and [[Bogside]], while others are derived from more affluent regions of the city, like [[Culmore]]. While the Cityside is commonly seen as the traditional base of the club, and especially the Brandywell area, the [[Waterside, Derry|Waterside]] area of the city, with its sizable [[Protestant]] population, boasts a significant support base. Despite the perception of Derry City being a [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]]-supported club, it does have numerous supporters who would be of a [[Protestant]] upbringing. With the city viewed as a focal point of culture and activity serving the north-west region of [[Ireland]], Derry's support stretches beyond the urban border of the city and into the surrounding [[County Londonderry|county]]. [[Limavady]] contains a signifant support base, as does [[Strabane]] in nearby [[County Tyrone]] and even areas of bordering [[County Donegal]]. Nevertheless, the majority of Derry's support would indeed come from those within the nationalist community. Of course, the cause of this is rooted in geography, as well as social, cultural and historical circumstances much beyond the club's control or direction, as opposed to the club or its fans specifically pushing towards the creation of a certain identity for itself or themselves. 

The club has numerous local supporter clubs, as well as clubs outside of [[Northern Ireland]]. These are mainly made up of natives of the city who have moved away but kept up their support for the team. [http://www.derrycitychat.com Derry City Chat] is a supporters' discussion forum website run by fans of the club. The club itself has from time-to-time made announcements on this forum.

==In popular/general culture==
[[Image:Myperfectcous.JPG|thumb|170px|The single cover for ''My Perfect Cousin'' by the [[Undertones]] featuring a Derry City figurine.]]
*The cover of the [[Undertones]]' 1980 hit single, ''My Perfect Cousin'', featured a [[Subbuteo]] figure in the colours of Derry City. The song's video saw [[Feargal Sharkey]] kick and leap to head a ball while wearing the red and white jersey.<ref>"[http://derrycityfc.net/club/folklore/myperfectcousin.php The Undertones Connection]," ''[[Michael Bradley (musician)|Michael Bradley]], CityWeb'', [[07 November]], 1991.</ref> Similarly, on the cover of their second ever single, ''Get Over You'', the words "Derry City F.C." can be seen.
*A bizarre [[own-goal]], in which the opposition goal-keeper was lobbed from outside the box by a player from his own team, scored by [[Finn Harps|Finn Harps']] Terry Leake for Derry City during a 1989-90 season [[Brandywell]]-meeting<ref>"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhBDrPydnc&mode=related&search Video of bizarre Finn Harps own-goal]", ''YouTube'', [[15 November]], 2006.</ref> once appeared on the "What happened next?" round of the [[BBC|BBC's]] ''[[A Question of Sport]]''.
*On [[20 April]], 2005, Derry City featured in a radio documentary ''The Blues and the Candy Stripes'' on [[RT√â Radio 1|RT√â Radio 1's]] ''Documentary on One''. The documentary was produced in the aftermath of the historic friendly game between Derry and [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] that took place on [[22 February]], 2005 - the first between the two teams to occur since a game on [[25 January]], 1969 during which Linfield's fans had to be evacuated from the [[Brandywell]] by police at half-time due to civil unrest and ugly scenes within the ground.<ref name=Radio>"[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/1044693.html The Blues and the Candy Stripes]", ''RT√â.ie'', [[20 April]], 2005.</ref> The 2005 match was organised as somewhat of a security test in the run-up to the likely possibility that both teams, with socially polar fan-bases, would qualify for and be drawn against one another in a near-future [[Setanta Cup]] competition.
*In the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' shown the night before Derry's clash with [[Paris St. Germain]] in the 2006-07 [[UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup's]] First Round, it was highlighted that [[Archie McLeod]], the grandfather of [[David Tennant]], the tenth ''[[Doctor Who]]'', was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had inticed him over from the highlands of [[Scotland]].
*During an [[08 January]], 2007 episode of [[RT√â|RT√â's]] ''[[The Panel (Ireland)|The Panel]]'', Irish comedian, [[Karl Spain]], was seen drinking from a mug displaying the crest of Derry City. Although Spain himself is not known to be a fan of Derry, one of the shows producers, Seamus Cassidy from Derry, is. During the next show one week later, fellow comedian, [[Dara O'Briain]], was also seen drinking from the mug. On [[22 January]], 2007 the mug was seen in the hands of a third panelist, Irish television and radio personality, [[Ray D'Arcy]].

==Trivia==
*The ''[[Derry Journal]]'' once reported that [[Gary Linekar]] had signed for Derry. However, the date of the publication was [[01 April]], and the story was, of course, an [[April Fools]] prank.

*Both [[Shay Given]] and [[David Ginola]] once played for a Derry City Select XI in a charity match to raise funds for [[Omagh]]'s redevelopment after the town was [[Omagh bombing|bombed]] by the IRA in 1998. Ginola is remembered for scoring a cheeky dink from a penalty which he sent straight down the middle of the goal after feigning and tricking the keeper into diving to the side. This was followed by a smug grin - not at all in the spirit of sombre commemoration of the atrocity.

*After the [[John Duddy]]-[[Anthony Bonsante]] 'Erin Go Brawl' [[boxing]] bout on [[16 March]], 2007 in [[Madison Square Garden]], [[New York]], a Derry City F.C. flag was held behind Duddy during the victor's television interview.
