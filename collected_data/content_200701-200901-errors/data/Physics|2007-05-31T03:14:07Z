'''Physics''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''{{Polytonic|φύσις}}'' (''phúsis''), "[[nature]]" and ''{{Polytonic|φυσικῆ}}'' (''phusiké''), "knowledge of nature") is the branch of [[science]] concerned with the discovery and characterization of universal laws which govern [[matter]], [[energy]], [[space]], and [[time]]. The role of physics, then, is to provide a logically ordered picture of [[nature]] in agreement with experience.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Hubble ultra deep field.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The deepest visible-light image of the [[universe]], the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]]]
Since antiquity, [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] have sought to explain [[physical phenomenon|physical phenomena]] such as [[History of astronomy|the movement of the planets]] and the [[metaphysics|nature of matter]], and this pursuit was formerly the study known as "''physics''" (once spelled ''physike'', in imitation of Aristotle). The emergence of modern physics as a [[science]] distinct from [[natural philosophy]] began with the [[scientific revolution]] of the 16th and 17th centuries and continued through the dawn of [[modern physics]] in the early 20th century.  The field has continued to expand, with a growing body of [[research]] leading to discoveries such as the [[Standard Model]] of fundamental particles and a detailed [[cosmology|history of the universe]], along with revolutionary new technologies like [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[semiconductor]]s. Research today progresses on a vast array of topics, including high-temperature [[superconductivity]], [[quantum computing]], the [[Higgs boson]], and the [[String theory|attempt]] to develop a theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Firmly grounded in observations and [[experiment]]s, with a rich set of [[theory|theories]] expressed in elegant [[mathematics]], physics has made a multitude of contributions to [[science]], [[technology]], and [[philosophy]].

Discoveries in physics resonate throughout the [[natural science]]s, and physics has been described as the "fundamental science" because other fields such as [[chemistry]] and [[biology]] investigate systems whose properties are based upon the laws of physics.<ref>''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' Volume I, Chapter III. Feynman, Leighton and Sands. ISBN 0-201-02115-3 For the philosophical issues of whether other sciences can be "reduced" to physics, see [[reductionism]] and [[special sciences]].</ref> Chemistry, for example, is the science of substances formed by [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s in bulk, but the properties of [[chemical compound]]s are determined by the physical properties of their underlying molecules.

[[Experiment|Experimental]] physics is closely related to [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. Physicists involved in [[basic research]] design and perform experiments with equipment such as [[particle accelerator]]s and [[laser]]s, whereas [[physicist]]s involved in [[applied research|applied]] research [[Invention|invent]] technologies such as [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] and [[transistor]]s.

[[Theoretical physics]] is closely related to [[mathematics]], which provides the language of physical theories. While it is true that the first task of theory is to disclose relationships in a world-picture which agrees with experience, an equally important part of its work is to formulate these relationships mathematically. The use of mathematics in theory represents a rationalization of thought, in that the process of deriving important conclusions from the initial hypotheses runs in the channels of formal rules of calculation. However, the position of mathematics in the field of theoretical physics implies that it is not the problem of the theoretical physicist to devise mathematical proofs and, indeed, the strict requirements of mathematics often contradict the physical facts. Theoretical physicists also often rely on [[numerical analysis]] and [[simulation#computer simulation|computer simulations]], and, thus, the role of computers and computer programming has an ever richer role in the formulation of physical models. In fact, the fields of [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and [[computational physics]] are active areas of research. Theoretical physics often relates to [[philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]] when it deals with speculative ideas like multidimensional spaces and [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]].

== Theories ==
Although physicists study a wide variety of phenomena, there are certain theories that are used by all physicists. Each of these theories has been tested in numerous experiments and proven to be a correct approximation of nature within its domain of validity. For example, the theory of [[classical mechanics]] accurately describes the motion of objects, provided that they are much larger than atoms and move much slower than the [[speed of light]].  While these theories have long been well-understood, they continue to be areas of active research—for example, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after its original formulation by [[Isaac Newton]] ([[1642]]–[[1727]]). The "central theories" are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and all physicists are expected to be literate in them.

* ''[[Classical mechanics]]'' is a model of the physics of [[force]]s acting upon bodies. It is often referred to as "Newtonian mechanics" after Newton and his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. Classical mechanics is subdivided into [[statics]], which models objects at rest, [[kinematics]], which models objects in motion, and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], which models objects subjected to forces. It is superseded by [[relativity|relativistic mechanics]] for systems moving at large velocities near the speed of light, [[quantum mechanics]] for systems at small distance scales, and [[relativistic quantum field theory]] for systems with both properties. Nevertheless, classical mechanics is still very useful, because it is much simpler and easier to apply than these other theories, and it has a very large range of approximate validity. Classical mechanics can be used to describe the motion of human-sized objects (such as tops and baseballs), many astronomical objects (such as planets and galaxies), and certain microscopic objects (such as organic molecules.) 
* ''[[Electromagnetism]]'' -- called also ''Electromagnetics'' -- is the physics of the [[electromagnetic field]], a [[field (physics)|field]] that results from the presence and motion of [[electric charge|charged]] [[Elementary particle|particle]]s and exerts forces on them. The sub-discipline of [[electrodynamics]] describes the behavior of moving charged particles interacting with electromagnetic fields. Electromagnetism encompasses various real-world electromagnetic phenomena. In fact, [[light]] is an oscillating electromagnetic field that is [[radiation|radiated]] from accelerating charged particles. Aside from gravity, most of the forces in everyday experience are ultimately a result of electromagnetism. 
* ''[[Thermodynamics]]'' is the branch of physics that deals with the action of [[heat]] and the conversions from one to another of various forms of [[energy]]. Thermodynamics is particularly concerned with how these affect [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[volume]], [[action (physics)|mechanical action]], [[entropy]], and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. ''[[Statistical mechanics]]'', a related theory, is the branch of physics that analyzes [[macroscopic]] [[thermodynamic system|systems]] by applying [[statistics|statistical principles]] to their microscopic constituents. It can be applied to calculate the thermodynamic properties of bulk materials from the properties of individual molecules, which is the basis of ''[[statistical thermodynamics]]''.
* The ''[[theory of relativity]]'' is:
** a physical theory which is based on the [[postulates of special relativity|two postulates]]: (1) that the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is constant and independent of the source or observer and (2) that the mathematical forms of the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] are invariant in all [[inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]]-- called also ''[[special relativity]]'', ''special theory of relativity''. It leads to the assertion of the [[Mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]] and of change in [[mass]],[[dimension]], and [[time]] with increased [[velocity]].
** an extension of special relativity to include transformations between non-inertial frames-- also called ''[[general relativity]]'' or the ''general theory of relativity''. It is formulated using [[differential geometry|differential]] [[geometry]] and interprets gravity as a distortion of [[spacetime]] caused by the presence of mass or energy.
* ''[[Quantum mechanics]]'' is the branch of [[mathematical physics]] treating [[atom|atomic]] and [[subatomic particle|subatomic]] systems and their interaction with [[radiation]] in terms of observable quantities. It is based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called ''[[quantum|quanta]]''. Quantum mechanics provides a physical theory of matter that is based on the concept of the possession of [[wave]] properties by elementary particles, affords a mathematical interpretation of the structure and interactions of matter on the basis of these properties, and incorporates within it ''quantum theory'' and the [[uncertainty principle]] -- called also ''[[wave mechanics]]''. Remarkably, quantum theory typically permits only [[probability|probable]] or [[statistics|statistical]] calculation of the observed features of subatomic particles, understood in terms of [[wavefunction]]s. The discovery of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revolutionized physics, and quantum mechanics is fundamental to most areas of current research.

== Research ==
[[Image:Meissner effect.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A [[magnet]] levitating above a [[high-temperature superconductor]] (with boiling [[liquid nitrogen]] underneath), demonstrating the [[Meissner effect]] — a phenomenon of importance to the field of [[condensed matter physics]]]]

Contemporary research in physics is divided into several distinct fields.

* [[Condensed matter physics]] is concerned with how the properties of bulk matter, such as the ordinary [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s we encounter in everyday life, arise from the properties and mutual interactions of the constituent atoms.  A topic of current interest is high-temperature [[superconductivity]].

* [[Atomic, molecular, and optical physics]] deals with small numbers of atoms and molecules, particularly with how they interact with [[light]]. A topic of current interest is the behavior of [[Bose-Einstein Condensate|Bose-Einstein condensates]].  

* [[Particle physics]], also known as "high-energy physics", is concerned with the properties of submicroscopic particles much smaller than atoms, including [[elementary particle|elementary particles]] such as electrons, photons, and quarks.  A topic of current interest is the search for the [[Higgs boson]].

* [[Astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]] apply the laws of physics to explain celestial phenomena, including [[stellar dynamics]], [[black hole|black holes]], [[galaxy|galaxies]], and the [[big bang]].  A topic of current interest is determining the nature of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].

Since the [[twentieth century]], the individual fields of physics have become increasingly [[specialization|specialized]], and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. "Universalists" such as [[Albert Einstein]] ([[1879]]–[[1955]]) and [[Lev Landau]] ([[1908]]–[[1968]]), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.

=== Theory and experiment, pure and applied ===

The culture of physics research differs from most sciences in the separation of [[theory]] and [[experiment]]. Since the [[twentieth century]], most individual physicists have specialized in either [[theoretical physics]] or [[experimental physics]]. The great [[Italy|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] ([[1901]]–[[1954]]), who made fundamental contributions to both theory and experimentation in [[nuclear physics]], was a notable exception. In contrast, almost all the successful theorists in [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] (e.g. American [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemist]]  and [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[Linus Pauling]]) have also been experimentalists, although this is changing as of late.

Roughly speaking, theorists seek to develop through [[Model (abstract)|abstractions]] and [[mathematical model]]s theories that can both describe and interpret existing experimental results, and successfully predict future results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to explore new phenomena and test theoretical predictions. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon each other.  Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot account for, necessitating the formulation of new theories. Likewise, ideas arising from theory often inspire new experiments. In the absence of experiment, theoretical research can go in the wrong direction; this is one of the criticisms that has been leveled against [[M-theory]], a popular theory in high-energy physics for which no practical experimental test has ever been devised.  Theorists working closely with experimentalists frequently employ [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenology]].

[[Applied physics]] is physics that is intended for a particular technological or practical use, as for example in [[engineering]], as opposed to [[basic research]].  This approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the physical sciences, but is concerned with the use of scientific principles in practical devices and systems, and in the application of physics in other areas of science. "Applied" is distinguished from "pure" by a subtle combination of factors such as the motivation and attitude of researchers and the nature of the relationship to the technology or science that may be affected by the work.

[[Image:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Aristotle]]]]
Since antiquity, people have tried to understand the workings of Nature and the behavior of [[matter]]: why unsupported objects drop to the ground, why different [[materials science|materials]] have different properties, and so forth. The character of the [[universe]] was also a mystery, for instance the [[earth]] and the behavior of celestial objects such as the [[sun]] and the [[moon]]. Several theories were proposed, most of which were incorrect, such as the earth orbiting the moon. These first theories were largely couched in [[philosophy|philosophical]] terms, and never verified by systematic experimental testing, as is popular today. The works of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] were not always found to match everyday observations. There were exceptions and there are [[anachronism]]s - for example, [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] and [[Indian science and technology#Astronomy|astronomers]] gave many correct descriptions in [[atomism]] and [[astronomy]], and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] derived many correct quantitative descriptions of [[mechanics]] and [[hydrostatics]].

[[Image:Ibn_haithem_portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ibn al-Haitham]] (Alhazen)]]
The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers eventually resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the [[Scientific Revolution]] of the late [[seventeenth century]]. The precursors to the scientific revolution may be traced back to the important developments made in [[India]] and [[Persia]], including the [[ellipse|elliptical]] model of the planets based on the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[solar system]] of [[gravitation]] developed by [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]]-astronomer [[Aryabhata]]; the basic ideas of [[atomic theory]] developed by [[Hindu]] and [[Jaina]] philosophers; the theory of light being equivalent to energy particles developed by the Indian [[Buddhist]] scholars [[Dignāga]] and [[Dharmakirti]]; the optical theory of [[light]] developed by [[Islamic science|Muslim scientist]] [[Ibn al-Haitham]] (Alhazen); the [[Astrolabe]] invented by the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]] [[Muhammad al-Fazari]]; and the significant flaws in the [[Ptolemaic system]] pointed out by Persian scientist [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]].

===The Scientific Revolution===

As the influence of the [[Arab Empire]] expanded to Europe, the works of Aristotle, preserved by the [[Arab]]s, and the works of the Indians and Persians, became known in medieval Europe by the [[twelfth century|twelfth]] and [[thirteenth century|thirteenth centuries]]. 

[[Image:Mikolaj Kopernik.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] <!-- do not enter nationality claims here--> 1473-1543]]
This eventually led to the '''''scientific revolution''''', held by most historians (e.g., Howard Margolis) to have begun in [[1543]], when the first printed copy of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'' was brought to the influential <!-- do not enter nationality claims here--> astronomer from [[Nuremberg]] (Nürnberg), where it had been printed by [[Johannes Petreius]]. Most of its contents had been written years prior, but the publication had been delayed. Copernicus died soon after receiving the copy.

[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Galileo Galilei]]]] Further significant advances were made over the following century by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Blaise Pascal]]. During the early [[seventeenth century]], Galileo pioneered the use of experimentation to validate physical theories, which is the key idea in modern [[scientific method]]. Galileo formulated and successfully tested several results in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], in particular the Law of [[Inertia]]. 

[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Sir Isaac Newton]]]] The scientific revolution is considered to have culminated with the publication of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in [[1687]] by the mathematician, physicist, alchemist and inventor Sir [[Isaac Newton]] ([[1643]]-[[1727]]).In [[1687]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], from which arise [[classical mechanics]]; and [[gravity|Newton's Law of Gravitation]], which describes the [[fundamental force]] of [[gravity]]. Both theories agreed well with experiment. The Principia also included several theories in [[fluid dynamics]]. 

From the late [[seventeenth century]] onward, [[thermodynamics]] was developed by physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]], and many others. In [[1733]], [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] used statistical arguments with classical mechanics to derive thermodynamic results, initiating the field of [[statistical mechanics]]. In [[1798]], [[Benjamin Thompson|Thompson]] demonstrated the conversion of mechanical work into heat, and in [[1847]] [[James Joule|Joule]] stated the law of conservation of [[energy]], in the form of heat as well as mechanical energy. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the nineteenth century, is responsible for the modern form of statistical mechanics.

Classical mechanics was re-formulated and extended by [[Leonhard Euler]], French mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Joseph-Louis Comte de Lagrange]], Irish mathematical physicist [[William Rowan Hamilton]], and others, who produced new results in mathematical physics. The law of universal gravitation initiated the field of [[astrophysics]], which describes [[astronomy|astronomical]] phenomena using physical theories.

After Newton defined [[classical mechanics]], the next great field of inquiry within physics was the nature of [[electricity]]. Observations in the [[seventeenth century|seventeenth]] and [[eighteenth century]] by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] created a foundation for later work. These observations also established our basic understanding of electrical charge and [[electric current|current]].

The existence of the atom was proposed in [[1808]] by [[John Dalton]].

[[Image:James Clerk Maxwell.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]
In [[1821]], the English physicist and chemist [[Michael Faraday]] integrated the study of [[magnetism]] with the study of electricity. This was done by demonstrating that a moving [[magnet]] induced an [[electric current]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]. Faraday also formulated a physical conception of [[electromagnetic field]]s. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] built upon this conception, in [[1864]], with an interlinked set of twenty equations that explained the interactions between [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. These twenty equations were later reduced, using [[vector calculus]], to a set of [[Maxwell's equations|four equations]] by [[Oliver Heaviside]].

In addition to other electromagnetic phenomena, Maxwell's equations also can be used to describe [[light]]. Confirmation of this observation was made with the [[1888]] discovery of [[radio]] by [[Heinrich Hertz]] and in [[1895]] when [[Wilhelm Roentgen]] detected [[X-ray]]s. 

===Modern physics===

[[Image:Einstein patentoffice.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Albert Einstein]]]]
The ability to describe light in electromagnetic terms helped serve as a springboard for [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of the theory of [[special relativity]] in 1905. This theory combined classical mechanics with Maxwell's equations.
The theory of [[special relativity]] unifies space and time into a single entity, [[spacetime]]. Relativity prescribes a different transformation between [[inertial frame of reference|reference frames]] than classical mechanics; this necessitated the development of relativistic mechanics as a replacement for classical mechanics. In the regime of low (relative) velocities, the two theories agree. Einstein built further on the special theory by including gravity into his calculations, and published his theory of [[general relativity]] in [[1915]].

One part of the theory of general relativity is [[Einstein's field equation]]. This describes how the ''stress-energy tensor'' creates curvature of [[spacetime]] and forms the basis of general relativity. Further work on Einstein's field equation produced results which predicted the [[Big Bang]], [[black hole]]s, and the [[expanding universe]]. Einstein believed in a static universe. He tried, and failed,  to fix his equation to allow for this. By [[1929]], however, [[Edwin Hubble]]'s astronomical observations suggested that the universe is expanding at a possibly exponential rate.

[[Image:Marie Curie (Nobel-physics).png|thumb|left|150px|[[Marie Sklodowska-Curie]]]]
In [[1895]], [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]] discovered [[X-ray]]s, which turned out to be high-frequency electromagnetic radiation.

[[Radioactivity]] was discovered in [[1896]] by [[Henri Becquerel]], and further studied by [[Maria Sklodowska-Curie]], [[Pierre Curie]], and others. This initiated the field of [[nuclear physics]].

In [[1897]], [[J.J. Thomson|Joseph J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]], the elementary particle which carries electrical current in [[electrical circuit|circuits]]. In [[1904]], he proposed the first model of the [[atom]], known as the [[atom/plum pudding|plum pudding model]]. Its existence had been proposed in [[1808]] by [[John Dalton]].

These discoveries revealed that the assumption of many physicists, that atoms were the basic unit of [[matter]], was flawed, and prompted further study into the structure of [[atom]]s.

[[Image:Ernest Rutherford.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ernest Rutherford]]]]
In [[1911]], [[Ernest Rutherford]] deduced from [[rutherford scattering|scattering experiments]] the existence of a compact atomic nucleus, with positively charged constituents dubbed [[proton]]s. [[Neutron]]s, the neutral nuclear constituents, were discovered in [[1932]] by [[James Chadwick|Chadwick]]. The equivalence of mass and energy (Einstein, 1905) was spectacularly demonstrated during [[World War II]], as research was conducted by each side into [[nuclear physics]], for the purpose of creating a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]]. The German effort, led by Heisenberg, did not succeed, but the Allied [[Manhattan Project]] reached its goal. In America, a team led by [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] achieved the first man-made [[nuclear chain reaction]] in [[1942]], and in [[1945]] the world's first [[nuclear weapon|nuclear explosive]] was detonated at [[Trinity site]], near [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]].

In [[1900]], [[Max Planck]] published his explanation of [[blackbody radiation]]. This equation assumed that radiators are [[quantum|quantized]], which proved to be the opening argument in the edifice that would become [[quantum mechanics]]. By introducing discrete energy levels, Planck, Einstein, [[Niels Bohr]], and others developed [[quantum]] theories to explain various anomalous experimental results. 

[[Image:Erwin Schrödinger.jpg|thumb|150px|left| [[Erwin Schrödinger]]]]
Quantum mechanics was formulated in [[1925]] by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and in [[1926]] by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]], in two different ways, that both explained the preceding heuristic quantum theories. In quantum mechanics, the outcomes of physical measurements are inherently [[probability|probabilistic]]; the theory describes the calculation of these probabilities. It successfully describes the behavior of matter at small distance scales. During the [[1920s]] Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and [[Max Born]] were able to formulate a consistent picture of the chemical behavior of matter, a complete theory of the electronic structure of the atom, as a byproduct of the quantum theory.

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Feynman-bongos.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Richard Feynman]]]] -->
[[Quantum field theory]] was formulated in order to extend quantum mechanics to be consistent with special relativity. It was devised in the late [[1940s]] with work by [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], and [[Freeman Dyson]]. They formulated the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]], which describes the electromagnetic interaction, and successfully explained the [[Lamb shift]]. Quantum field theory provided the framework for modern [[particle physics]], which studies [[fundamental force]]s and elementary particles.

[[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], in the [[1950s]], discovered an unexpected [[asymmetry]] in the decay of a [[subatomic particle]]. In [[1954]], Yang and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] then developed a class of [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] which provided the framework for understanding the nuclear forces (Yang, Mills 1954). The theory for the [[strong nuclear force]] was first proposed by [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. The [[electroweak force]], the unification of the [[weak nuclear force]] with electromagnetism, was proposed by [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam]], and [[Steven Weinberg]] and confirmed in [[1964]] by [[James Watson Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]]. This led to the so-called [[Standard Model]] of particle physics in the [[1970s]], which successfully describes all the elementary particles observed to date.

Quantum mechanics also provided the theoretical tools for [[condensed matter physics]], whose largest branch is [[solid state physics]]. It studies the physical behavior of solids and liquids, including phenomena such as [[crystal structure]]s, [[semiconductor|semiconductivity]], and [[superconductor|superconductivity]]. The pioneers of condensed matter physics include [[Felix Bloch]], who created a quantum mechanical description of the behavior of electrons in crystal structures in [[1928]]. The transistor was developed by physicists [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Bradford Shockley]] in [[1947]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].

The two themes of the [[twentieth century]], general relativity and quantum mechanics, appear inconsistent with each other. General relativity describes the [[universe]] on the scale of [[planet]]s and [[solar system]]s, while quantum mechanics operates on sub-atomic scales. This challenge is being attacked by [[string theory]], which treats [[spacetime]] as composed, not of points, but of one-dimensional objects, [[string theory|strings]]. Strings have properties similar to a common string (e.g., [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] and [[oscillation|vibration]]). The theories yield promising, but not yet testable, results. The search for experimental verification of string theory is in progress.

=== Future directions ===

{{main | Unsolved problems in physics}}

Research in physics is progressing constantly on a large number of fronts, and is likely to do so for the foreseeable future.

In condensed matter physics, the greatest unsolved theoretical problem is the explanation for [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. Strong efforts, largely experimental, are being put into making workable [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computer]]s.

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] have begun to appear. Foremost amongst these are indications that [[neutrino]]s have non-zero [[mass]]. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing [[solar neutrino problem]] in solar physics. The physics of massive neutrinos is currently an area of active theoretical and experimental research. In the next several years, [[particle accelerator]]s will begin probing energy scales in the [[TeV]] range, in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence for the [[Higgs boson]] and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]].

Theoretical attempts to unify [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] into a single theory of [[quantum gravity]], a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet borne fruit. Currently, the leading candidates are [[M-theory]], [[superstring theory]], and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Many [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena have yet to be explained satisfactorily, including the existence of [[GZK paradox|ultra-high energy cosmic rays]], the [[baryon asymmetry]], the [[accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]], and the [[galaxy rotation problem|anomalous rotation rates of galaxies]].

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [[quantum]], and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena, involving [[complex systems|complexity]], [[chaos]], or [[turbulence]] remain poorly understood. Complex problems that would appear to be soluble by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics, such as the formation of sand piles, nodes in trickling [[water]], the shape of water [[droplet]]s, mechanisms of [[surface tension]] [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]], or self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections are unsolved. 

These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, not least of which has been the availability of modern [[mathematics|mathematical]] methods and [[computers]], which enabled [[complex systems]] to be modeled in new ways. The [[interdisciplinary]] [[relevance]] of complex physics also has increased, as exemplified by the study of [[turbulence]] in [[aerodynamics]], or the [[observation]] of [[pattern]] [[formation]] in [[biology|biological]] systems. In 1932, [[Horace Lamb]] correctly prophesied the success of the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the near-stagnant progress in the study of turbulence:
<blockquote>''I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.''</blockquote>
