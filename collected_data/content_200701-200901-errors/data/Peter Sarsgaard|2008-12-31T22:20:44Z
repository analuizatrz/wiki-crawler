Following the success of ''Shattered Glass'', Sarsgaard starred in several roles. In 2004, he starred in the comedy-drama ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'', where he played Mark, the sarcastic best friend to [[Zach Braff]]'s character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1112224,00.html|title=It's time that Peter Sarsgaard became a star|date=2005-09-30|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=''ew.com''|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44201-2004Aug5.html|title=Braff, Portman Blossom in 'Garden State'|last=Hornaday|first=Anne|date=2004-08-06|work=[[Washington Post]]|publisher=''washingtonpost.com''|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref> In the same year, he portrayed [[Clyde Martin]], in the [[biographical film]] ''[[Kinsey (film)|Kinsey]]'', a movie about the life of [[Alfred Kinsey]], played by [[Liam Neeson]], where Kinsey's [[sexology|sexologic]] research, in his 1948 publication, ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'', was one of the first recorded works that tried to scientifically address and investigate [[sexual behaviour]] and its consequences in humans.<ref name="kinsey">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/11/12/review.kinsey/index.html|title=Review: 'Kinsey' gripping look at sex, people|last=Clinton|first=Paul|date=2004-11-12|work=[[CNN|CNN: Showbiz/Movies]]|publisher=''cnn.com''|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref> ''Kinsey'' was Sarsgaard's first film role which featured [[nudity|full frontal nudity]].<ref name="kinsey guy">{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/issue_story_ektid00722.asp|title=Sex and the Kinsey guy|last=Vary|first=Adam B.|date=2005-03-01|work=[[The Advocate]]|publisher=''advocate.com''|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref> Paul Clinton of [[CNN]] in review of the film noted: "Peter Sarsgaard, playing the bisexual researcher Clyde Martin, whose performance stands out, and confirms that he's without doubt one of the best character actors of his generation."<ref name="kinsey"/> When asked about his kissing scenes with Neeson in ''Kinsey'', Sarsgaard said: 
{{cquote|It wasn’t as hard as, say, running around with all my gear on in ''Jarhead''. I’d rather go for an awkward moment than physical exertion any day. The only thing that I think [male actors] get freaked out about when they have to do something like kiss a guy in a movie—when to their knowledge they’re straight—is that they’re afraid they’re going to be turned on. And if you’re not afraid that you’re going to be turned on—meaning that you know what you like—then really it’s not that hard.<ref name="time"/>}}

In 2005, Sarsgaard starred in the drama ''[[The Dying Gaul (film)|The Dying Gaul]]'', where he plays Robert Sandrich, a struggling screenwriter who has written a serious love story about a man and his terminally ill partner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=7565|title=Suspenseful 'Dying Gaul' falls victim to abrupt ending|last=Morris|first=Wesley|date=2005-11-18|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=''boston.com''|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref> The film garnered favorable reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/dyinggaul?q=the%20dying%20gaul|title=Dying Gaul, The (2005): Reviews|date=2005-11-04|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=''metacritic.com''|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref> In an interview, Sarsgaard said, he felt like he was playing a character based on [[Craig Lucas]], the director, whom he describes as "elitist in a fun way". Because his character, a screenwriter, is also "elitist," when he sells his soul by compromising his artistic vision, "the conflict seems bigger. Anyone can sell their soul. Even people with integrity. There's always that temptation to guard against. Which is why it's best to keep as much as possible hidden."<ref name="empathist4">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/movies/13sarsgaard.html?pagewanted=4&ei=5088&en=a657c4f3871dfb1f&ex=1289538000&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=The Empathist|last=Hirschberg|first=Lynn|date=2005-11-13|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=''nytimes.com''|pages=4|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref>
