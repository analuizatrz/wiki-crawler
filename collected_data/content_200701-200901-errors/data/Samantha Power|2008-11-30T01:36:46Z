'''Samantha Power''' (born September 21, 1970, in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) is an [[Irish American]] journalist, writer, and academic. She is currently affiliated with the [[Carr Center for Human Rights Policy]] at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Kennedy School of Government]]. Power has been a winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and was a senior adviser to U.S. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] until March 2008 when she resigned, later rejoining the Obama State Department transition team in late November 2008.

==Biography==
Power was born and raised in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] before [[Irish diaspora|emigrating]] to the [[United States]] in 1979. She attended [[Lakeside High School (DeKalb County, Georgia)|Lakeside High School]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where she was a member of the cross country team and the basketball team. She later graduated from [[Yale University]].

From 1993 to 1996, she worked as a journalist, covering the [[Yugoslav wars]] for ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and ''[[The New Republic]]''. 

When she returned to the United States, she attended [[Harvard Law School]], graduating in 1999. Her first book, ''[[A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide]]'', grew out of a paper she wrote in law school. The book won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 2003. It offers a survey of the origin of the word genocide, the major genocides of the 20th century, as well as an analysis of some of the underlying reasons for the persistent failure of governments and the international community to collectively identify, recognize and then respond effectively to genocides ranging from the [[Armenian Genocide]] to the [[Rwandan Genocide]].  This work and related writings have been criticized by the renowned historian [[Howard Zinn]] for downplaying the importance of "unintended" and "collateral" civilian deaths that could be classified as genocidal<ref>http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/14673</ref>; and by [[Edward S. Herman]] for systematically ignoring genocidal projects sponsored by the United States in Guatemala, in East Timor, and Southeast Asia. <ref>http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/14622</ref>


A scholar of foreign policy especially as it relates to [[human rights]], [[genocide]], and [[AIDS]], she is currently the [[Anna Lindh]] Professor of Practice of Global Leadership and Public Policy at Harvard's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]].

In 2004, Power was named by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' as one of the 100 top scientists and thinkers of that year.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/2004/time100/scientists/100power.html TIME Magazine: TIME 100: Samantha Power<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In fall 2007, she began writing a regular column for ''Time''. Power appears in [[Charles H. Ferguson|Charles Ferguson]]'s 2007 documentary, ''[[No End in Sight]],'' which alleges numerous missteps by the Bush administration in the U.S. war in Iraq.

The character of Nadia Blye in [[The Vertical Hour]], a play by David Hare, shares key surface [http://bookcriticscircle.blogspot.com/2006/12/there-is-no-comparison-to-real.html similarities] with Ms. Power.

Power spent 2005-06 working in the office of U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]] as a foreign policy fellow, where she was credited with sparking and directing Obama's interest in the [[Darfur conflict]]<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/13390609/campaign_08_the_radical_roots_of_barack_obama/4 "The Radical Roots of Barack Obama",] ''[[Rolling Stone]]''</ref>. She served as a senior foreign policy adviser to [[Barack Obama presidential campaign|Obama's 2008 presidential campaign]] until she was forced to resign for referring to [[Hillary Clinton]] as "a monster". Power apologized for the remarks made in an interview with ''[[The Scotsman]]'' in London, and resigned from the campaign shortly thereafter.

Her second book, ''Chasing the Flame: Sergio Vieira de Mello and the Fight to Save the World'' was released on February 14, 2008. It concerns [[Sergio Vieira de Mello]], the [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and [[United Nations]] Special Representative in [[Iraq]] who was killed in the [[Canal Hotel bombing]] in [[Baghdad]] along with [[Jean-Sélim Kanaan]], [[Nadia Younes]], [[Fiona Watson]], and other members of his staff, on the afternoon of August 19, 2003.

==Personal life==

In January 2008, Power began dating the prominent law professor [[Cass Sunstein]] whom she met while working on the Obama campaign.<ref>{{cite news

==Views==

Alongside her advocacy for Barack Obama's candidacy, Power is best known for her efforts to increase awareness with regard to genocide and human rights abuses, particularly the Darfur conflict. In 2006, she contributed to ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]]'', a movie about the [[Darfur Genocide|Darfur]], [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]], and other genocides of the 20th and 21st centuries. 

Power has become a leading voice calling for armed intervention into humanitarian crisis situations, endorsing the [[Genocide Intervention Network]] and becoming a founding Board member.

Regarding the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], Power said in 2002, that if she were an advisor to the U.S. President she would recommend investing "billions of dollars, not in servicing Israel's military, but actually investing in the new state of Palestine, in investing the billions of dollars it would probably take, also, to support what will have to be a mammoth protection force [in Palestine], not of the old Rwanda kind, but a meaningful military presence", even though this may alienate "a domestic constituency of tremendous political and financial import".<ref>[http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Power/power-con5.html Conversation with Samantha Power]</ref>

==2008 Obama Democratic Party presidential campaign==

When she joined the Obama campaign as a foreign policy advisor, ''[[Men's Vogue]]'' described her as a "Harvard brainiac who can boast both a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and a mean [[jump shot]] (ask [[George Clooney]]). Now the consummate outsider is working on her inside game: D.C. politics." <ref>[http://www.mensvogue.com/business/politics/feature/articles/2007/06/samantha_power Samantha Power, the outsider with a jump shot, is working on her inside game: D.C. politics: Crime + Politics: mensvogue.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In February and March 2008, Power began an international book tour to promote her book, ''Chasing the Flame''. Because of her involvement in the Obama campaign, many of the interviews she gave revolved around and her and Barack Obama's foreign-policy views, as well as the 2008 campaign. Notable statements she made during the book tour include the following:

* In an interview with the [[BBC]]'s ''[[HARDtalk]]'' on March 6, Power stated that Barack Obama's pledge to "have all U.S. combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months"<ref>[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/ Issues: Iraq - Obama'08 (campaign web site)]</ref> was a "best case scenario" that "he will revisit when he becomes president."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/7281805.stm HARDtalk: Samantha Power - BBC News: Programmes 2008-03-06]</ref> Challenged by the host as to whether this contradicted Obama's campaign commitment, she responded, "You can’t make a commitment in March 2008 about what circumstances will be like in January of 2009.... He will, of course, not rely on some plan that he’s crafted as a presidential candidate or a U.S. Senator. He will rely upon a plan — an operational plan — that he pulls together in consultation with people who are on the ground to whom he doesn’t have daily access now, as a result of not being the president." <ref>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0308/Power_on_Obamas_Iraq_plan_best_case_scenario.html Power on Obama's Iraq plan: "best case scenario" - Politico: Ben Smith (weblog) 2008-03-07]</ref> She concluded by saying that "what we can take seriously is that he will try to get U.S. forces out of Iraq as quickly and responsibly as possible."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/7281805.stm HARDtalk: Samantha Power - BBC News: Programmes 2008-03-06]</ref>

* In a March 6 interview with ''[[The Scotsman]]'', she said: "We fucked up in Ohio. In Ohio, they are obsessed and Hillary is going to town on it, because she knows Ohio's the only place they can win".<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Inside-US-poll-battle-as.3854371.jp "Hillary Clinton's a monster': Obama aide blurts out attack in Scotsman interview" - The Scotsman  2008-03-06]</ref> <ref>[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/03/obama-foreign-p.html Political Punch<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "She is a monster, too — that is off the record — she is stooping to anything... You just look at her and think, 'Ergh.' But if you are poor and she is telling you some story about how Obama is going to take your job away, maybe it will be more effective. The amount of deceit she has put forward is really unattractive."

* In a March 7 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', she said, about the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], "I am confused by what's happened to [[Gordon Brown]]. I thought he was impressive."<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/07/wpower107.xml Barack Obama 'will repair image of US in UK'], Alice Thomson and Rachel Sylvester, ''Daily Telegraph'', March 8, 2008</ref>

Power apologized for the "monster" remarks on the night of the March 6 interview, saying that they "do not reflect my feelings about Sen. Clinton, whose leadership and public service I have long admired."<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/03/07/2008-03-07_barack_obama_forced_to_decry_advisers_mo.html Barack Obama forced to decry adviser's 'monster' remarks of Hillary Clinton - New York Daily News 2008-03-07]</ref> In the wake of reaction to the remarks, she resigned from the campaign the next day.
<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign8mar08,0,4538249.story 'Obama aide forced out for calling Clinton "a monster"']</ref> Soon afterwards, the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' said that it "might have been the most ill-starred book tour since the invention of [[movable type]]."<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/014/858jhkph.asp "Power Outage"], ''Weekly Standard'', March 17, 2008</ref>

She also appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on March 17, 2008, where she also explained that she did not really mean that Hillary Clinton is a monster.

==Obama transition team==

After the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Power returned to Obama's team, and currently is a member of the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|transition team]]. She is working on [[Department of State]].  It is unclear if Power will get a position in department<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081128/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/obama_adviser</ref>.
