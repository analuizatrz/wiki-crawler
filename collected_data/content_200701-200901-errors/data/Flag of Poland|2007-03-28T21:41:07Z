The '''[[national colors]] of [[Poland]]''' are [[white]] and [[red]], and their exact shades are described in Polish law (see below). If displayed horizontally, the white is on top, if vertically &ndash; on the left. The colors, which are of [[heraldry|heraldic]] origin and have a history dating back to [[1831]], are one of three constitutional symbols of the Republic of Poland, along with the coat of arms, the [[coat of arms of Poland|White Eagle]], and the national anthem, ''[[Mazurek Dąbrowskiego]]''. The '''Polish flag''' is a rectangular piece of cloth in the national colors, with or without the Polish coat of arms on the white stripe. Polish [[Flag Day]] is celebrated on May 2.

== Legal specifications ==
The colors and flags of the Republic of Poland are described in two legal documents: the [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland]] of 1997,<ref name=const>{{pl icon}} [http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/polski/kon1.htm ''Konstytucja Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej''] <nowiki>[</nowiki>{{en icon}} [http://bib.sejm.gov.pl/tek/txt/kpol/eng/kon1.html ''Constitution of the Republic of Poland'']<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Dz.U. 78.483.1997</ref> and the Coat of Arms, Colors and Anthem of the Republic of Poland, and State Seals Act (''Ustawa o godle, barwach i hymnie Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz o pieczęciach państwowych'') of 1980 with subsequent amendments<ref name=act>{{pl icon}} [http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/du/2005/2000.htm ''Ustawa o godle, barwach i hymnie Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz o pieczęciach państwowych''] <nowiki>[</nowiki>''Coat of Arms, Colors and Anthem of the Republic of Poland, and State Seals Act''<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Dz.U. 05.235.2000</ref> (henceforth referred to as "the Coat of Arms Act"). 

The legislation concerning the national symbols is far from perfect. The Coat of Arms Act has been amended a number of times and refers extensively to executive ordinances, some of which have never been issued. Moreover, the Act contains many errors, ommissions and inconsitencies which make the law confusing, open to various interpretations and often not followed in practice.<ref name=nik> {{pl icon}} Najwyższa Izba Kontroli, ''[http://bip.nik.gov.pl/pl/bip/wyniki_kontroli_wstep/inform2005/2005076/px_2005076.pdf Informacja o wynikach kontroli używania symboli państwowych przez organy administracji publicznej]'' <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[The Supreme Chamber of Control of Poland|Supreme Chamber of Control]], ''Information about the results of the control of the usage of state symbols by the organs of public administration''<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Warsaw, April 2005</ref>

Chapter I, Article 28, paragraph 2 of the Constitution says that:

:''Colors of the Republic of Poland are white and red.''<ref name=const />

The Constitution contains no mention of a national flag. Further specifications can be found in the Coat of Arms Act. According to Article 4 of the act:

:''Colors of the Republic of Poland are white and red in two horizontal, parallel stripes of equal width, of which the top one is white and the bottom one is red.''<ref name=act />

The same article further specifies that if the colors are displayed vertically, the white stripe is placed on the left from the onlooker's viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal and vertical alignment, as well as coordinates of both colors in the [[Lab color space|CIE 1976]] color space.

The Coat of Arms Act specifies two variations of the state flag: the '''state flag of the Republic of Poland''' (''flaga państwowa Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'') and the '''state flag with coat of arms of the Republic of Poland''' (''flaga państwowa z godłem Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej''). Both flags are defined in Article 6 of the act as follows:

#''The state flag of the Republic of Poland is a rectangular piece of cloth in the colors of the Republic of Poland hoisted on a flagpole.'' 
#''The state flag of the Republic of Poland is also the flag specified in paragraph 1, with the coat of arms of the Republic of Poland placed in the middle of the white stripe.''<ref name=act />

The fly to host ratio for both flags is 8:5. For the latter flag, the ratio between the [[inescutcheon]] of the cost of arms and the hoist is 2:5. Images of both variations of the flag can be found in attachment no. 3 to the Coat of Arms Act. 

Applying the rules of English heraldry and [[vexillology]], the above descriptions may be rendered into the following [[blazon]]s:

#''Per fess [[Argent]] and [[Gules]].''
#''Per fess Argent and Gules, in chief an inescutcheon of the Arms of Poland.''

== Usage ==
=== Respect for the flag ===
Polish law says that treating the national symbols, including the flag, "with reverence and respect" is the "right and obligation" of every Polish citizen and all state organs, institutions and organizations.<ref name=act /> Public disrespect, destruction or violent removal of the flag is considered a crime punishable by "a [[fine]], limitation of freedom <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Penal labour|penal servitude]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> or up to one year of deprivation of freedom <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[prison|imprisonment]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>".<ref name=penal>{{pl icon}} [http://isip.sejm.gov.pl/servlet/Search?todo=file&id=WDU19970880553&type=3&name=D19970553Lj.pdf ''Kodeks karny''] <nowiki>[</nowiki>''Penal code''<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Dz.U. 88.553.1997</ref> Official statistics show that crimes against national symbols are rare: 43 such crimes in 2003 and 96 in 2004 were less than 0.001% of all registered crimes in Poland.<ref name=nik />

=== Who may and who is required to fly the flag ===
[[Image:Solidarnosc.png|right|thumb|300px|Polish flag is part of the [[Solidarity]] logo as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule.]]
According to the Coat of Arms Act, "everyone has the right to use the colors of the Republic of Poland, particularly in order to underline the significance of celebrations, holidays and other events" as long as it is done in a respectful manner.<ref name=act /> This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. Unauthorized use of national symbols was illegal and flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year.<ref name=nik /> This restriction and kind of state monopoly on the use of national symbols during the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Communist regime]] made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government.<ref>[[Małgorzata Niezabitowska]], ''Discovering America'', ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'', January 1988, p. 48</ref> It became customary &ndash; and still is &ndash; for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on [[strike]].

[[Image:Sejm.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Polish flag flying atop the Sejm]]
Organs that are required by law to fly the state flag (without coat of arms) on or in front of their official buildings are:
* the [[Sejm]] (lower house of parliament);
* the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] (upper house of parliament);
* [[President of the Republic of Poland|President of the Republic]];
* the [[Council of Ministers of Poland|Council of Ministers]] (government) and the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|President of the Council of Ministers]] (Prime Minister);
* local legislatures &ndash; only during their sessions;
* other state and local government organs &ndash; only on national holidays.
Additionally, the state flag (without coat of arms) is used as an [[ensign]] for [[inland navigation]].<ref name=act />

While the ban on using the flag without coat of arms has been lifted, the use of the state flag with coat of arms is still legally restricted. This flag should be only flown on:
* Polish [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]], [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] and other representative offices and missions abroad;
* civilian [[airport]]s and [[heliport]]s;
* civilian [[airplane]]s &ndash; only during international flights;
* buildings of [[seaport]] authorities;
* as a [[Civil ensign|merchant (civil) ensign]].<ref name=act />
In practice, however, this restriction is often ignored and the two flags &ndash; with and without coat of arms &ndash; are treated as interchangeable.<ref name=nik />

=== Flag flying days ===
State and local government organs are legally required, and other institutions and organizations as well as all citizens are encouraged to fly the Polish flag on the following days:
* May 1 &ndash; State Holiday ([[May Day]]);
* May 2 &ndash; Polish Flag Day;
* May 3 &ndash; [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution]] Day;
* November 11 &ndash; Independence Day.

'''Polish Flag Day''' (formally: Flag of the Republic of Poland Day, ''Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'') was first observed on May 2, 2004. It was established in order to educate the Polish people about the history and significance of national symbols. The choice of date was mostly due to practical reasons: since May 2 is already a day between two mandatory flag flying days, it allows for the flag to be flown continuously for three consecutive days. Polish diaspora outside Poland and the Polish Senate also observe [[Polonia]] Day on May 2, which was another reason why the Polish Flag Day has been established on that date. Unlike May Day and Constitution Day, it is not a [[Holiday#Public holidays|public holiday]], although making a bridge, i.e. taking a day off on that day is common practice (see [[Holidays in Poland]]).

[[Image:Benedykt 0041.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Polish (white and red), papal (yellow and white) and Marian or municipal (white and blue) flags in [[Kraków]]'s [[Rynek Główny|Grand Square]] during [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s visit to Poland on [[May 27]] [[2006]].]]

Other days when the Polish flag is often flown on official buildings include:
* May 5 and 9 &ndash; [[European symbols#Europe Day|Europe Days]] (together with the [[European flag]]);
* August 15 &ndash; [[Polish Armed Forces]] Day (mostly on military premises and at [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|tombs of the Unknown Soldier]])
* September 29 &ndash; [[Polish Secret State|Polish Underground State]] Day.

The flag is also popularly flown during imporant sporting events, such as the [[FIFA World Cup]], if Polish athletes are participating; and during an official visit of a particularly important person, especially a [[pope]], in Poland. During a pope's visit, the national flag is usually flown together with yellow and white [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] flags, and white and blue [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Marian]] flags. It is not common to fly the national flag on personal occasions, such as birthdays or weddings.

According to polls, about ⅓ of Poles say they own a Polish flag, and about ¼ fly it on national holidays. Such public display of patriotism is much more common in western Poland, especially in [[Greater Poland]], than in other parts of the country.<ref name=nik />

=== National mourning ===
The President of the Republic may announce a period of [[National day of mourning|national mourning]]. During that time Polish flags are flown at [[half-staff]].<ref name=act /> If a flag is flown from a wooden pole rather than a staff or mast, a black ribbon is attached to the pole as a sign of mourning.

== History ==
[[Image:Choragiew Krakowska.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Image:IFIS Historical.png|Historical]] Great Banner of the Territory of Kraków which also served as a banner of the whole [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (modern reconstruction).]]

For centuries, the Polish flag consisted of a red background emblazoned with a [[White Eagle]]. During the times of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] the flag featured both symbols of Poland and of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], though in fact there was little need for a state flag in a modern sense. Most of the [[chorągiew|military units]] flown the flags of their lands or founders (usually featuring [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]]) and only the royal regiments used the royal standards. Some of the detachments however adopted the red and white stripes as their symbol. The shapes however often differed. 

The situation changed in [[19th century]], during the [[partitions of Poland]], when Polish patriots required an easily-recognizable flag that could be used both for identification of troops on the battlefield and as a [[symbol]] of the state. On [[February 7]], [[1831]] during the [[November Uprising]], the [[Sejm]] decided that national colours of Poland are those of [[Coat of Arms of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], that is white above red. However, after the fall of the uprising the official flag of [[Congress Kingdom]] was changed back to that of the [[List of Russian rulers|tsars of Russia]]. 

After Poland regained her independence in [[1918]], there was a considerable controversy over the adoption of a state flag. The coat of arms was obvious as it has been in use for roughly 900 years, however there were several possible versions of the flag. Finally, on [[August 1]] [[1919]], the Sejm adopted the white and red flag at its current shape. Since the same shape and colours were used by port authorities around the world for [[harbour pilot]]s and [[tugboat]]s, the same act of the parliament adopted a variation of the flag with the coat of arms of Poland placed in the middle of the white stripe. The latter version was used as the [[Civil ensign]] for the merchant marine and by the diplomatic service abroad. 

Since then the flag of Poland remained almost the same, with the exception of colour changes introduced twice (see below). At the same time, the version with the coat of arms changed several times, in accordance with the changes applied to the coat of arms itself. In [[1927]] a new design of the White Eagle was introduced. Between [[1928]] and [[1938]] the flag with the coat of arms served solely as the flag of the Polish merchant marine, after which it was again introduced as a flag of Polish diplomatic service.<ref>Used only abroad.</ref> After the [[World War II|war]] the new communist regime removed the crown from the Eagle’s head and replaced (perhaps accidentally) the rosettes on its wings with stars, a change that was applied also to the flag. The changes were confirmed by the decree of [[December 7]] [[1955]]. It also extended the use of the flag with coat of arms to civil aviation (airports and civilian planes while abroad). The act of [[1980]] added port authorities to the list. The crown was reintroduced in [[1990]], and the current version is basically the same as that of [[1927]], with minor cosmetic changes.

The act of [[1919]] did not specify the exact shade of the red colour featured on the Polish flag. In a [[1921]] pamphlet issued by the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs<ref>{{pl icon}} {{fr icon}} {{cite book | author=[[Stanisław Łoza]] | coauthors =Zygmunt Czaykowski | title =Godło i barwy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej &ndash; Armoiries et couleurs de la République Polonaise | year =1921 | pages =10 | publisher=Ministry of Military Affairs|location =Warsaw }}</ref> all the state flags and symbols used the [[crimson]] red. The possible reason might have been that following [[17th century]] the crimson was one of the most expensive [[dye]]s and was used by the [[magnate]] families and rich [[szlachta]] for their garments. The tradition was later adopted by various military formations (for instance, the soldiers of the [[Bar Confederation]]) who wore distinctive crimson coats, serving a similar role to the British [[red coat]]s. On [[December 13]] [[1928]] the [[President of Poland]] officially settled the controversy by ruling that the correct shade is rather [[vermilion]]. The shade was in use until [[1980]], when a need arose to better describe the correct colour using scientific description rather than traditional names. On [[January 31]] [[1980]] a new act of the Polish parliament described the colour using the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]][[CIELUV|LUV]] standard.
