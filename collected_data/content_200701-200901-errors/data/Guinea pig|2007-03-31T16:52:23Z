'''Guinea pigs''' (also called '''cavies''' after their scientific name) are [[rodents]] belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus ''[[Cavia]],'' originally native to the [[Andes]]. Despite their common name, the animals are not [[pig]]s, nor do they come from [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]. The guinea pig plays an important role in the [[folk culture]] of [[indigenous]] [[South America]]ns, as a food source, cultural emblem, and implement in [[folk medicine]].<ref name=morales/> In Western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household [[pet]] since its introduction by European traders in the sixteenth century. More recently, organizations devoted to [[Animal fancy|competitive breeding]] of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and a large number of [[Domestic varieties of guinea pigs|specialized breeds]] of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders. 

"Guinea pig" is also used as a by-word in English for a subject of scientific experimentation; this usage has been common since the first half of the twentieth century. The animals were frequently used in scientific contexts in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents, such as [[mice]] and [[rat]]s. They are still used in research primarily as models for human medical conditions such as [[juvenile diabetes]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[preeclampsia|pregnancy complications]].

== History ==

The common guinea pig was first [[domestication|domesticated]] about [[5000 BC]] for food by mountain tribes in the [[Andean]] region of [[South America]], (present-day [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]).<ref name=morales/> They continue to be a food source in the region, subsisting off a family's vegetable scraps as a pet. [[Folklore]] traditions involving guinea pigs abound; they are exchanged as gifts, used in customary social and religious ceremonies, and are frequently referenced in spoken [[metaphor]]s.<ref name=morales/> They also play a role in some traditional healing rituals by folk doctors or [[curandero]]s. They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick, and are seen as a medium through which supernatural healing occurs.<ref name=morales/> Guinea pigs are called ''quwi'' in [[Quechua]] and ''cuy'' or ''cuyo'' (pl. ''cuyes, cuyos'') in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.<ref name=diccionario>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Diccionario de la Lengua Española | publisher = Real Academia Española | url = http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/ | language = Spanish | accessdate = 2007-03-12 }}</ref>

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[England|English]] traders brought guinea pigs to [[Europe]], where they quickly became popular as exotic [[pet]]s among the upper classes and royalty, including [[Queen Elizabeth I]].<ref name=morales/> The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] naturalist [[Konrad Gesner]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gmelig-Nijboer | first = C. A. | title = Conrad Gessner's "Historia Animalum": An Inventory of Renaissance Zoology | date = 1977 | publisher = Krips Repro B.V. | pages = pp. 69-70|}}</ref> Its official binomial scientific name, ''Cavia porcellus'', was conferred by [[Linnaeus]] in 1758.

== Name ==

How the animals came to be thought of as "pigs" is not clear. They are built somewhat like a [[pig]], with a large head relative to the body, a stout neck, and a rounded rump with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating. They can survive for long periods of time in small quarters, like a 'pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe.

The animal's name carries connotations of it being a pig in many languages. The [[German language|German]] word for them is ''[[Wiktionary:Meerschweinchen|Meerschweinchen]]'', literally "little sea pigs" (sailing ships stopping to re-provision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat; ''Meerschwein'' = porpoise, another food source for sailors). The Welsh term is ''mochyn cwta'' ('little pig'), the [[French language|French]] ''[[Wiktionary:Cochon d'Inde|Cochon d'Inde]]'' (Indian pig); the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] used to call it ''[[Wiktionary:nl:cavia|guinees biggetje]]'' (Guinean piglet). In [[Italian language|Italian]] the term is either ''Porcellino d'India'' (Little Indian Pig) or ''Cavia Peruviana'' (Peruvian Cavy). This is not universal; for example, the common Spanish word is ''conejillo de Indias'' (little rabbit of India / the Indies).<ref name=diccionario/> The [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] of the common species is ''Cavia porcellus'', with ''[[Wiktionary:porcellus|porcellus]]'' being [[Latin]] for "little pig". Cavia is derived from Portuguese çavia (now savia) from the Tupi word saujá, meaning rat.<ref>{{cite web | title = Definition of cavy | publisher = Merriam-Webster Online | url = http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=cavy | accessdate = 2007-03-12|}}</ref>

The origin of "guinea" in "guinea pig" is even harder to explain. One theory is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], leading people to think they had originated there.<ref name=wagner>{{cite book | last = Wagner | first = Joseph E. | last2 = Manning | first2 = Patrick J | title = The Biology of the Guinea Pig | date = 1976 | publisher = Academic Press | id = ISBN 0-12-730050-3}}</ref> "Guinea" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, and so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's foreignness.<ref name=dictionary>{{ cite web | title = Results for "Guinea pig" | publisher = Dictionary.com | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Guinea%20pig | accessdate = 2006-08-29 }}</ref> Another theory suggests the "guinea" in the name is a corruption of "[[Guiana]]", an area in [[South America]], though the animals are not native to that region.<ref name=wagner/><ref name=dictionary/> A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold as the closest thing to a pig one could get for a [[Guinea coin|guinea]]; this theory is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and [[William Harvey]] is known to have used the term "Ginny-pig" as early as 1653.<ref>{{cite book | last = Harvey | first = William | title = Anatomical exercitations concerning the generation of living creatures to which are added particular discourses of births and of conceptions, &c | date = 1653 | pages = p. 527|}}</ref>  Others believe "guinea" may be an alteration of the word [[coney]]; guinea pigs were referred to as "pig coneys" in [[Edward Topsell]]'s 1607 treatise on [[quadruped]]s.<ref name=wagner/><ref>{{cite web | title = Guinea Pig | publisher = Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2007 | url = http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575668/Guinea_Pig.html | accessdate=2007-03-12|}} </ref>

== Traits and environment ==
[[Image:Nibbles_and_strips_2.jpg|thumb|300px|Two abyssinian guinea pigs]]

Guinea pigs are large for rodents, weighing between 0.5 and 1.5 [[kilogram|kg]] (1–3 [[Pound (mass)|pound]]s), and measuring 25–40 [[metre|cm]] (10–15 [[inch]]es) long. They typically live an average of four to five years, and occasionally as long as eight years.<ref name=richardson>{{cite book | last = Richardson | first = V.C.G. | title = Diseases of Domestic Guinea Pigs | |edition = 2nd edition | publisher = Blackwell | date = 2000 | page = 132 |id = ISBN 0-632-05209-0 }}</ref> According to the 1997 [[Guinness Book of Records]] the longest living guinea pig survived 15 years.<ref>{{cite book | title = Guinness Book of World Records | date = 1997 | publisher = Bantam | id = ISBN 978-0553576849|}}</ref> They are social, living in the wild in small groups which consist of sows (females), a boar (male), and the young (which in a break with the preceding [[pig|porcine]] nomenclature are called pups). Domesticated guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are not introduced to a female, and proper introduction techniques are employed.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Your Guinea Pigs' Social Life | publisher = Cavy Spirit | url = http://www.cavyspirit.com/sociallife.htm  | accessdate = 2006-10-14 }}</ref> 

In the wild, guinea pigs are found on grassy plains and occupy an [[ecological niche]] similar to that of the [[cattle|cow]]. They move together in groups ([[herds]]) eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food.<ref name=wagner/> While they do not [[burrow]], they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by [[vegetation]].<ref name=wagner/> They are [[crepuscular]], tending to be most active during dawn and dusk, when it is harder for predators to spot them.<ref name=terril>{{cite book | last = Terril | first = Lizabeth A. | last2 = Clemons | first2 = Donna J. | title = The Laboratory Guinea Pig | publisher = CRC Press | date = 1998 | id = ISBN 0-8493-2564-1|}}</ref> Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different rhythm, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between.<ref name=terril/> Activity is scattered randomly over the 24 hours of the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.<ref name=terril/>

Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, though some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs will dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Cages with wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with a foot infection commonly known as [[bumblefoot (infection)|bumblefoot]] (ulcerative pododermatitis).<ref name=richardson/> Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material. Bedding made from [[red cedar]] and [[pine]], both [[softwood]]s, were commonly used in past decades but are now believed to contain harmful [[phenol]]s (aromatic hydrocarbons) and oils.<ref name=terril/> Safer beddings include those made from [[hardwoods]] (such as [[aspen]] or [[hemp]]); paper products and corn cob are other alternatives.<ref name=terril/>  "Cubes and [[Coroplast]]" (or C&C) style cages are now a common choice.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Your Guinea Pigs' Home | publisher = Guinea Pig Cages | url = http://www.guineapigcages.com  | accessdate = 2006-08-29 }}</ref> Guinea pigs tend to be messy with their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their [[urine]] crystallizes on cage surfaces and can be difficult to remove.<ref name=richardson/><ref name=terril/><ref name=harkness>{{cite book | last = Harkness | first = John E. | last2 = Wagner | first2 = Joseph E. | title = The Biology and Medicine of Rabbits and Rodents | publisher = Williams & Wilkins | date = 1995 | id = ISBN 0-683-03919-9}}</ref>

Despite the popular misconception, even referenced in television [[commercials]] by [[Blockbuster]], guinea pigs and [[Rabbits]] are not considered to be good companions and may even cause fatalities when kept together. As [[Lagomorpha|lagomorphs]] rabbits have very different nutritional requirements and may harbor diseases (such as the respiratory infection [[Pasteurella]]) that guinea pigs are more susceptible to. Also, even the smallest dwarf rabbit is much stronger and may cause intentional or inadvertant injury with their strong hind legs. It is additionally known that the two have dissimilar social habits, with rabbits commonly performing activities like [[social grooming]] that guinea pigs do not. 

Unlike many rodents such as [[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s, or [[squirrel]]s, guinea pigs cannot climb, and are not particularly agile. However, they startle extremely easily, and will run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger.<ref name=terril/> When excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little jumps in the air (known as "popcorning").<ref>{{ cite web | title = Guinea Pigs | publisher = Canadian Federation of Humane Societies | url = http://cfhs.ca/athome/guinea_pigs  | accessdate = 2007-03-21 }}</ref> 

Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food. They can accurately remember the learned path for weeks and months. Their strongest and overwhelming problem solving strategy is moving.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Charters | first = Jessie Blount Allen | title = The associative processes of the guinea pig: A study of the psychical development of an animal with a nervous system well medullated at birth | journal = Journal of comparative neurology and psychology | volume = XIV | issue = 4 | pages = 300-337 | publisher = University of Chicago | date = July 1904 | url = http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC16980230&id=dWcKAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA300&lpg=RA2-PA300&dq=guinea+pigs#PRA1-PA299,M2 | accessdate = 2006-12-27 }}</ref>

Guinea pigs are very vocal animals. Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species.<ref name=terril/> Some sounds are:<ref name=terril/><ref name=jackie>{{cite web | title = Guinea Pig Sounds | publisher = Jackie's Guinea Piggies | url = http://jackiesguineapiggies.com/guineapigsounds.html | accessdate = 2007-03-14|}} Includes sound files.</ref>

* '''Wheek''' or '''Whistle'''- A loud noise that is essentially onomatopoetic.  An expression of general excitement, it may occur in response to the presence of its owner or to food replenishment. It is sometimes used to find other guinea pigs if they are in a run. If a guinea pig is lost, it may wheek for assistance. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Feeding_Wheek.ogg|listen}}
* '''Bubbling''', or '''Purring''' - This rather pleasant sound is made when the guinea pig is enjoying itself,  when being petted or held. They may also make this sound when grooming, crawling around to investigate a new place, or when given food. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Happy.ogg|listen}}‎ 
* '''Rumbling''' - This sound is related to guinea pig dominance. It can also come as a response to comfort or contentment. Whilst courting, a male usually purrs deeply, while swaying from side to side, nearly lifting the rear feet. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Keep_Away.ogg‎|listen}}
* '''Chutting''' and '''Whining''' - these are sounds made in pursuit situations, by the pursuer and pursuee, respectively. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Angry.ogg‎|listen}}
* '''Chattering''' - This sound is made by rapidly gnashing the teeth together, and is generally a sign of warning. Guinea pigs tend to raise their heads when making this sound.
* '''Squealing''' or '''Shrieking''' - a high-pitched sound of discontent, in response to pain or danger. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_In_Distress.ogg‎‎|listen}}

* '''Chirping''' - This less-common sound seems to be related to stress. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Chirping.ogg‎|listen}}

== Breeding ==
[[Image:Fat_Adie_pictures_001.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Pregnant sow one week before delivering three pups.]]

The guinea pig's [[gestation]] period lasts from 59-72 days, with an average of 63-68 days.<ref name=nrc>{{cite book | last = National Resource Council | title = Laboratory Animal Management: Rodents | publisher = National Academy Press | date = 1996 | pages = pp.72-73 | id = ISBN 0-309-04936-9|}}</ref> Pups are already well developed at birth, including fur, teeth, claws and full eyesight, when they are born.<ref name=harkness/>  The young are mobile from birth, and depending on the environment, will usually venture outdoors within a week. Pups begin eating solid food after a couple of days, though continue to [[suckle]] also. [[Litter (animal)|Litters]] generally yield 1-6 young, with an average of 3.<ref name=richardson/> In smaller litters, difficulties may occur during labour, due to over-sized pups. Large litters may result in higher incidences of [[stillbirth]], but because the pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, lack of access to mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns.<ref name=wagner/> Cohabitating females may assist in mothering duties if lactating.<ref name=percy>{{cite book | last = Percy | first = Dean H. | last2 = Barthold | first2 = Stephen W. | title = Pathology of Laboratory Rodents and Rabbits | publisher = Iowa State University Press | edition = 2nd edition | date = 2001 | pages = pp.209-247 | id = ISBN 0-8138-2551-2}}</ref>

[[image:Guinea_baby_1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Guinea pig pup at eight hours old.]]

Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped (aubergine), although the change in size and shape varies among individual animals. Breeding males produce a strong musk that smells much like [[beeswax]].

Sexing of guinea pigs can be difficult, as males and females do not differ in external appearance apart from general size, and the position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes.<ref name=richardson/> Female genitals are distinguished a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vaginal flap; while the male genitals may look similar with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair.<ref name=richardson/> The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.<ref name=richardson/>

Males reach sexual maturity at 3-5 weeks; females can be fertile as early as four weeks and can carry litters before they themselves are adults.<ref name=richardson/> Females that have never been bred commonly develop irreversible fusing of the [[pubic symphysis]], a joint in the [[pelvis]], after six months of age.<ref name=nrc/>  If they become [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently, this may lead to [[dystocia]] and death as they attempt to give birth.<ref name=richardson/> Females can become pregnant in 6-48 hours after giving birth, and it is not healthy for a female to be in virtually a constant state of pregnancy.<ref name=richardson/>

[[Toxemia of pregnancy]] is common and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, and a [[ketone]] breath odor, and in advanced cases seizures and death.<ref name=richardson/> Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates.<ref name=richardson/> Other serious complications of pregnancy can include a [[prolapse|prolapsed uterus]], [[hypocalcemia]], and [[mastitis]].<ref name=richardson/>

== Diet ==
[[Image:Cavy_eating_grass.jpg|thumb|right|An Agouti guinea pig eating grass.]]

[[Grass]] is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their [[molar]]s are particularly suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life.<ref name=wagner/> Most grass-eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer [[colon]]s than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by practicing [[coprophagy]], the eating of their own feces.<ref name=richardson/>  However, they do not consume their feces indiscriminately. They produce special soft pellets, called "cecotropes", which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion; these are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese.<ref name=richardson/><ref name=terril/> They share this behaviour with [[rabbit]]s. 

Guinea pigs benefit from feeding on fresh grass hay, such as [[Timothy-grass|timothy hay]], in addition to food pellets which are often based from timothy. [[Alfalfa]] is also a popular food choice, though there exists some controversy over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Conventional wisdom among pet owners has it that, as a [[legume]] rather than true grass hay, alfalfa is too vitamin-rich for any but pregnant and young guinea pigs.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Guinea Pig Care | publisher = Cavy Spirit | url = http://www.cavyspirit.com/care.htm  | accessdate = 2007-03-26 }}</ref> Some veterinary organizations concur, and state that excessive alfalfa consumption may lead to [[obesity]] and [[bladder stone (animal)|bladder stone]]s due to excess [[calcium]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Health, Care, and Diet for a Guinea pig | url = http://www.lakehowellanimalclinic.com/html/guinea_pig.html | publisher = Lake Howell Animal Clinic | accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref> However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a source for replenishment of protein, [[amino acid]]s and fiber.<ref name=wagner/><ref name=terril/><ref>{{cite book | last = Institute for Laboratory Animal Resarch | title = Nutrient Requirements of Laboratory Animals | edition = 4th edition | publisher = National Academies Press | date = 1995 | pages = p. 106 | url =  http://books.nap.edu/openbook/0309051266/gifmid/106.gif | id = ISBN 0309051266 }}</ref> 

Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], and [[hydrogen ion]]s; adequate amounts of vitamins [[Vitamin E|E]], [[Vitamin A|A]], and [[Vitamin D|D]] are also necessary.<ref name=terril/> Like [[Homo sapiens|humans]], but unlike most other [[mammal]]s, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own [[vitamin C]] and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from [[scurvy]] and ultimately die. Guinea pigs require about 10 mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as [[apple]], [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]], [[carrot]], [[celery]], and [[spinach]]) or through supplements fed to domestic animals.<ref name=richardson/>

Imbalanced diets have been associated with [[muscular dystrophy]], [[metastatic calcification]], difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems.<ref name=wagner/><ref name=richardson/> Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity.<ref name=wagner/> They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accepting new food types.<ref name=richardson/> A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present.<ref name=richardson/>

A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including [[bracken]], [[bryony]], [[buttercup]], [[charlock]], [[deadly nightshade]], [[foxglove]], [[hellebore]], [[hemlock]], [[lily of the valley]], [[mayweed]], [[monkshood]], [[privet]],  [[ragwort]], [[rhubarb]], [[speedwell]], [[toadflax]] and [[wild celery]].<ref name=richardson/> Additionally, any plant which grows from a [[bulb]] (e.g., tulip and onion) is normally considered poisonous.<ref name=richardson/> Guinea pigs will also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.

== Health ==
[[Image:mvc-872s.jpg|thumb|300px|A red and white texel with [[Torticollis]], or wry neck]]

Common ailments in domestic guinea pigs include [[respiratory infection]]s, [[diarrhea]], [[scurvy]] ([[vitamin C]] deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), [[abscess]]es due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches), and infections by [[lice]], [[mite]]s or [[fungus]].<ref name=richardson/>

Mange mites (''Trixacarus caviae'') are a common cause of fur loss, whose symptoms also may include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched (due to pain), and in some instances, seizures.<ref name=richardson/> Guinea pigs may also suffer from "running lice" (''Gliricola porcelli''), a small white insect which can be seen running through fur. Other causes of fur loss can be due to hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as [[ovarian cyst]]s.<ref name=richardson/>

While it is normal for guinea pigs to [[sneeze]] periodically, frequent sneezing be a symptom of [[pneumonia]], especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by [[torticollis]] and can be fatal.<ref name=richardson/>

Guinea pigs are "prey animals" whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times signs of illness may not be apparent until a problem is severe or in its advanced stages.

== Domestic guinea pigs ==
{{mainarticle|Domestic varieties of guinea pigs}}
[[Image:rene2.jpg|thumb|300px|A long-haired lilac, orange and white Satin Peruvian Guinea pig]]

Guinea pigs are widely considered to be good pets. If handled early in their life by caring owners, they become very amenable to being picked up and carried, and will rarely bite or scratch.<ref name=harkness/> Guinea pigs who become familiar with their human seem to consider them part of their herd, and become distraught when separated for long periods. Because of this widespread popularity in domestic life, and especially because of their popularity in households with children, guinea pigs have often, in recent years, been featured in popular culture.

{{mainarticle|Guinea pigs in popular culture}}

[[Domestication|Domesticated]] guinea pigs come in many breeds which have been developed since their arrival in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. These varieties vary widely in hair and color composition.

All over the world there are Cavy Clubs and Associations dedicated to the showing and breeding of guinea pigs. The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the [[American Rabbit Breeders Association]], is the governing body in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web | title = Constitution | url = http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html | publisher = American Cavy Breeders Association | date = [[2006-09-29]] | accessdate = 2007-03-22}}</ref> Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.

== Guinea pigs in scientific research ==
Guinea pig experimentation dates back at least to the eighteenth century. In 1780, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] used a guinea pig in his experiments with the [[calorimeter]], a device used to measure heat production.  The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a [[combustion]], similar to a candle burning.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Buchholz | first = Andrea C | last2 = Schoeller | first2 = Dale A. | title = Is a Calorie a Calorie? | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/5/899S | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 79 | pages = pp. 899S&ndash;906S |date = 2004 | accessdate=2007-03-12|}}</ref>

In [[English language|English]], the term ''guinea pig'' is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation. This dates back to the early twentieth century; the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913.<ref>{{cite web | title = Guinea-pig. | publisher = Oxford English Dictionary online (subscription access required)  | url = http://dictionary.oed.com | accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref> In 1933, [[Consumers' Research]] founders [[F.

Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals into the later twentieth century, but are now less commonly used; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s,<ref name=gad>{{cite book | last = Gad | first = Shayne C. | title = Animal Models in Toxicology | publisher = Taylor & Francis | date = 2007 | edition = 2nd edition | pages = pp.334-402 | id = ISBN 0-8247-5407-7|}}</ref> but that total decreased to approximately 375,000 by the mid-1990s.<ref name=harkness/> They now constitute approximately 2% of the current total of laboratory animals.<ref name=gad/> [[Complement system|Complement]], an important component for [[serology]], was first isolated from the blood of guinea pigs.<ref name=gad/> In the past they were used to isolate different bacterial strains, but in modern labs they have been replaced primarily by mice and rats. Research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] made a number of contributions to this area of study, especially regarding [[pigmentation]].<ref name=wagner/>

Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans, cannot synthesize [[Vitamin C]] but must obtain it from diet, they have been used for research on diseases such as [[scurvy]].<ref name=gad/> Guinea pigs also have an unusual insulin mutation,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Chan | first = Shu Jin, et al. | title = Guinea Pig Preproinsulin Gene: An Evolutionary Compromise? | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA | volume = 81 | date = 1984 | pages = pp. 5046-5050}}</ref> and they are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bowsher | first = Ronald, et al. | title = Sensitive RIA for the Specific Determination of Insulin Lispro | url = http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/45/1/104 | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 45 | date = 1999 | pages = pp. 104-110 | accessdate = 2007-03-15}}</ref> Guinea pigs have been identified as model animals for the study of [[juvenile diabetes]] and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of [[preeclampsia]] in human females.<ref name=percy/> They are also used to diagnose [[tuberculosis]], because they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria.<ref name=gad/>

Guinea pig strains used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains. Aside from the common American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are albino, although pigmented strains are also available.<ref name=terril/> [[Inbred strain]]s are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology. Of the inbred strains that have been created, the two that are still used with any frequency are "Strain 2" and "Strain 13".<ref name=terril/>

== Guinea pigs as food ==
[[Image:Peru_Guinea_Pigs.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Peruvian guinea pigs being raised for consumption]]
Guinea pigs (called ''cuy'', ''cuye'', ''curí'') were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes.

To this day, cuye continues to be a major part of the diet in [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], particularly in the [[Andes Mountains]] highlands; they are also eaten in some areas of [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]].<ref name=morales/> Due to the fact that they require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly when compared to traditional stock animals, they can be raised as a source of food in an urban environment, unlike most livestock animals. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs as a source of supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.<ref name=morales/> Guinea pig meat is high in [[protein]] and low in [[fat]] and [[cholesterol]], and is described as being similar to [[rabbit]] and the dark meat of [[chicken]].<ref name=cbs>{{cite news | last = Vecchio | first = Rick | title = Peru Pushes Guinea Pigs as Food | publisher = [[CBS News]] | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/19/world/main650148.shtml | date = [[2004-10-19]] | accessdate = 2007-03-12|}}</ref><ref name=csmonitor>{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Chip | title = Guinea Pig: It's What's for Dinner | publisher = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1101/p04s01-woam.html | date = [[2006-11-01]] | accessdate = 2007-03-12|}}</ref> The animal may be served fried (''chactado''), broiled (''asado''), or roasted (''al horno''), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a [[casserole]] or a [[fricassee]].<ref name=morales/> Ecuadorians commonly consume ''sopa'' or ''locro de cuy'', a soup dish.<ref name=morales/> ''[[Pachamanca]]'' or ''[[huatia]]'', a process similar to [[barbecue]]ing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (''[[chicha]]'') in traditional settings.<ref name=morales/>

Peruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year, and the animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the [[Last Supper]] in the main cathedral in [[Cusco, Peru]] shows [[Christ]] and the twelve disciples dining on guinea pig.<ref name=cbs/> Guinea pigs are also consumed in [[Ecuador]], mainly in the [[Geography of Ecuador#La Sierra (the highlands)|Sierra]] region of the country, but are not depended upon as a staple source of protein.<ref name=morales/> Andean immigrants in [[New York City]] raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve it as a delicacy.<ref name=morales/> In the 2000s, Peruvian research universities began breeding larger-sized guinea pigs in the hope of increasing human consumption outside of South America.<ref name = cbs/>
