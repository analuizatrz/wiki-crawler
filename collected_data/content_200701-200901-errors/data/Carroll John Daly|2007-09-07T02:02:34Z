'''Carroll John Daly''' ([[1889]] &ndash; [[January 16]], [[1958]]) was a writer of [[crime fiction]]. He has been credited with creating the first [[hard-boiled]] detective story in 1923, predating the debut of [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s [[Continental Op]] character by several months. During that era, he was considered the leader of the naturalistic school of crime writers. Daly's private detective Race Williams was a rough and ready character with a sharp tongue, and established the model for many later acerbic private eyes.
