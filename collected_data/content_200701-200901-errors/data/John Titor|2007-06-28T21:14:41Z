'''John Titor''' is the name used by the person or persons claiming to be a [[time travel]]er from the year 2036 who posted on several time-travel–related [[bulletin board]]s during 2000/2001. In these posts he made numerous ambiguous predictions about events in the near future, starting with events in 2004.

Whether John Titor as a [[hoax]] has been a topic of controversy on web-based [[Anomalous phenomenon|paranormal]] [[Internet forum|discussion board]]s 
{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. He has also been discussed occasionally on the radio show [[Coast to Coast AM]] {{Verify source|date=June 2007}}.

==Titor's claims==
Most of the [[BBS|electronic bulletin board posts]] made by "John Titor" no longer exist. Titor posts appeared at ''Time Travel Institute,'' ''Anomalies Net'', and ''Time Travel Portal'', among other places. Darby @ Anomalies Network has copied the Titor-related threads from these bulletin boards. Titor made his first post there as "TimeTravel_0". More recently the story has been collected into a number of more "narrative" web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com|title=John Titor - Time Traveler|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

===Origins===
When asked if John Titor was his real name, he responded that John Titor is ''a'' real name.
    
In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from the year 2036, based in [[Tampa, Florida]] in [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], who was assigned to a [[government]]al time travel project. He was supposedly sent back to the winter of 1975 to retrieve an [[IBM 5100]] computer which he claimed was needed to "[[debug]]" various legacy computer programs in 2036. [[UNIX]] will, according to him, have a timeout error in [[2038 problem|2038]] and many of the mainframe systems that ran a large part of the infrastructure were based on very old IBM computer code. The 5100 has the ability to easily translate between the old IBM code, [[APL]], and [[BASIC]] programming languages {{Verify source|date=June 2007}}.

Titor had been selected for this mission specifically due to the fact his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the building and programming of the 5100, and of whom Titor had personal information due to the family tie. His grandfather was based in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] {{Verify credibility}}.

Titor claimed he was making an unauthorised stopover in the year 2000 for 'personal reasons', which may have involved warning his family of impending disasters; Titor spoke of his family often and claimed one of his objectives in 2000 was to collect a family photo album believed lost during [[World War III]] {{Dubious}}. Titor also claimed he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen to the possibility of a [[civil war]] in the [[United States]] that would begin with rising [[civil unrest]] in the year 2004. However Titor did state that all-out civil war would not occur until 2008.

Titor also had an interest in unexplained mysteries, such as [[UFO]]s which from his time were still as yet unexplained, explaining this as that which drew him to bulletin boards that discussed the [[paranormal]] and unexplained mysteries. Titor claimed he believed UFOs and alleged alien visitors may well be time travellers from much further into the future than his own time, and with much more accurate time machines than his own.

===Time machine details===
When questioned about the mechanisms of time traveling, Titor answered that he was no engineer. Nevertheless, some of these postings described the time machine and how it worked.

He described it as a "C204 time distortion [[gravity]] displacement machine' built by [[General Electric]] in 2034. It weighed approximately 500 pounds and was transported in a 1966 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] convertible. The vehicle remained stationary with the engine inactive while traveling through time. Apparently the time machine was removed from the Corvette and placed in a 1987 four wheel drive truck. According to the posts, there were six main components to his time machine:

# Two dual micro-singularities
# An [[electron]] injection system
# A cooling system
# Gravity sensors
# Four caesium [[atomic clock]]s
# Three [[computer]]s

The posts stated that the "two [[top-spin]], dual positive singularities" produced a "standard off-set Tipler sinusoid". The [[mass]] and gravitational pull of the micro-singularities were manipulated by injecting electrons onto its surface, replicating the effects of a Kerr-Newman [[black hole]]. When pressed for further details, he would claim he "was not an engineer". Nevertheless, he also posted images of the machine, and its effects on the beam of a [[laser pointer]] when operating, as well as posting parts of its technical manual. When asked to provide a better picture of his time machine, he replied that he wasn't a photographer.

When asked why the time machine did not lead to [[grandfather paradox|time travel paradoxes]], he stated that this was explained through the [[many-worlds interpretation]] (or as it was called, the Everett-Wheeler model), which he claimed was proven to be correct in the future. Simplistically, the Many Worlds theory suggests that for any event that could have different possible outcomes, ''every'' one of those outcomes occurs in a separate "[[universe]]". According to the posts, a time traveler does not actually enter their own past, but some other, similar, past. When asked to use the time machine to perform some [[paradox]]ical action, he replied that that would only affect this universe, but not his. He appeared to imply that there were many [[worldline]]s, and his [[time machine]] could not control its outgoing destination exactly, but could return to a worldline exactly similar to his own home. His originating "worldline" would, in turn, receive a John Titor exactly similar to the original. Therefore, his original "worldline" would indeed receive the benefit of his mission.

===Predictions===

The postings also described various future events between 2004 and 2037, including [[World War III]] (predicted for 2015) followed by two decades of recovery.

One such entry cited escalating conflict between [[Arab]]s and [[Jew]]s as a harbinger of World War III:

:"Real disruptions in world events begin with the destabilization of [[the West]] as a result of degrading US [[foreign policy]] and consistency. [...] The Jewish population in [[Israel]] is not prepared for a true offensive war. They are prepared for the ultimate defense. Wavering western support for Israel is what gives Israel's neighbors the confidence to attack. The last resort for a defensive Israel and its offensive Arab neighbors is to use [[weapons of mass destruction]]. In the grand scheme of things, the war in the [[Middle East]] is a part of what's to come, not the cause."

Along with this report of World War III's approach, another notable claim was that of a civil war in America, which was slated to begin in 2004, around the time of the presidential election, and would escalate until 2008 which, according to Titor, is "a general date by which time everyone will realize the world they thought they were living in was over." Another claim was that 2004 would be the last year in which the [[Olympic Games]] would occur.

These are taken from [http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/the_john_titor_project.html John Titor's original statements] and summarised.
* The [[2004 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], will be the last held. All others will be cancelled due to rising global tensions.
* In the United States, civil unrest will begin mounting in 2004/2005 due to a large number of factors; such as rising [[prejudice]]s, [[apathy]] and [[materialism]] in the populace, of which will sow the [[seed]]s. The real issues will begin in the US government, between [[left-wing]] and [[right-wing]] [[Ideology|ideologies]], and will eventually spread out into [[society]] as the population become more discontent with an ineffective and corrupt government. Eventually the United States will resemble something of a [[police state]] and there will be open rebellion against the government. Political arrests become commonplace. The people of the countryside avoid open conflict with the [[federal police]] and [[national guard]] by crowding together on farmland, whilst the people of the cities abandon civil liberties willingly under the guise of national security.
* A Second [[American Civil War]], lasting from 2008 to 2015, will manifest itself in a violent division between the large cities/[[urban area]]s against the countryside/[[rural areas]]. Most of the population, especially in the rural areas, arm themselves and form [[militia]] to repel their opponents. The exact deatails of this are sketchy however. As 13-year old, in 2011, Titor himself fought with the "Fighting Diamondbacks", a [[shotgun]] [[militia|infantry]] of [[Florida]], for at least four years. However, the ferocity of the civil war meant that Titor spent most of this time in hiding instead. Titor personally saw hundreds die horrific deaths. Still, he had killed, yet he never shot anyone "that wasn't trying to kill him".
* The war severs national distribution and cars become useless due the lack of [[petrol]]. Bicycles become a valued and rare method of transport. 
* The Second American Civil War has a knock-on effect which destablises all [[Western Civilisation]], both in economics and politics. This in turn assists the escalation of global conflict.
* When asked if there is a [[mysticism|mystical]] or [[religion|religious]] significance to the year 2012 (as equated with the ancient [[Mayan calendar]] which ends and then restarts in 2012), Titor confirmed this. An event similar to the "[[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]]" will occur in this year, although exactly what Titor meant by this is deliberately obscure as he didn't want to "spoil the surprise" (Titor claimed he was a [[Christian]], to whom religion was greatly significant, throughout his postings).
* [[World War III]] breaks out in 2015; a gradual global political escalation that was ended by [[Russia]] bombing American, European, and [[China|Chinese]] cities. 
** Sometime before this point (referred to as "N-Day"), China forcefully annexes [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Taiwan]].
** [[Australia]] successfully repels a Chinese invasion.
** [[Russia]] declares war on at least three other [[world power]]s; these include the United States, the [[European Union]] and [[China]]. However it is not made clear whether this was in response to some form of aggression, nor is clear at what point all four powers enter the war except that China is one of the primary aggressors.
** Titor was somewhere near [[Jacksonville]] in [[Florida]] when a Russian [[nuclear warhead]] fell on it. Soon after a "loved one" contracted [[brain cancer]], a direct result of the [[nuclear fallout]], and Titor expressed his regret at "not acting soon enough".
** [[Chemical weapons|Chemical]] and [[biological weapons]] are used, and some [[Less-lethal weapons|"non-lethal" weapons]] turn out to be quite lethal.
** The political and economic structure of the European Union is utterly destroyed in the bombardment, as is also the case in China.
** Almost all major US cities are destroyed (although the only cities specifically named as being ruined are the capital [[Washington DC]], and [[Jacksonville, Florida]]). The only city stated as surviving is [[Omaha, Nebraska]].
** By the end of the war, almost 3 billion people are dead.
* Post-war 
** Communities of survivors gather and grow around [[library|libraries]] and [[university|universities]], renamed to "Forts" due to the prescence of army garrisions that are placed there to protect the populations.
** The United States splits into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives.
** The [[US Constitution]] is changed by a Constitutional Congress.
*** A President is elected for each of the five major areas of the US.
*** The powers of the union government are more defined and reside at the county and state level. 
*** The Vice President is elected separately.
*** The US Capital is in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].
* Life in 2036:
** [[Society]]
*** [[Military service]] plays a large part in day-to-day life.
*** [[Capital punishment]] is still implemented.
*** Communities have returned to a family/community centred state, advised by elders.
*** [[Texas]] is Hispanicized.
** [[Economy]]
*** In certain areas of the US (the more rural areas), all [[money|monetary systems]] are abolished and the entire community works together to raise crops, build domiciles, etc., or they face expulsion  from the community. However in the areas of larger surviving populations, money, trading and [[banking]] still exist, although at a smaller community level. There are no surviving centralised banks.
*** [[Agriculture]] makes up the bulk of the surviving US ecomony.
*** US [[exports]] have restarted by 2036. The main trader with the US is their old enemy, [[Russia]].
** [[Religion]] and [[Beliefs]]
*** Religion is far more personal and plays a major part in day-to-day life.
*** The [[Ten Commandments]] have been restored to the "10" that God allegedly gave [[Moses]].
*** [[Sabbatarianism]], or worship on Saturday, is a common practice. 
** [[Technology]]
*** [[Wireless network|Wireless internet]] is ubiquitous.
*** [[Television]] and [[telephony]] are delivered via the Web.
*** Almost all music has been successfully archived on the internet. [[Classical music]] has become the most popular.
*** [[Book]]s and other hard media are now distributed online and printed from local hubs.
*** [[Microsoft]] and [[Yahoo!]] no longer exist. [[Napster]] still distributes music via the web.
*** [[Electricity|Power]] is not distributed over long distances. [[Alternate energy#Renewable energy|Alternate forms of energy]] generation are common, the most prevalent being [[Solar power|solar]].
** [[Sport]]
*** [[Association Football]] ([[soccer]]) will become the most popular sport in the United States.
** Transport
*** High-speed electric trains connect the larger areas of population in the US.
*** Cars begin to be used again, although they are rare due the rarity of fuel.
*** Bicycles remain a popular method of transport.
** [[Natural environment|Environment]]
*** The environment is heavily affected by [[radiation]]. The lack of [[potable water]] is the biggest environmental issue.
*** [[Global warming]] has had little effect. Temperature is about the same although there were anomalies after the war.
** [[Health]]
*** The [[birth rate]] is much lower, due to a high number of birth defects and [[stillbirth]]s.
*** Mad Cow disease, or [[vCJD]] in humans, is a devastating public health problem. Titor stated that even in the year 2000, he would not eat [[processed meat]].
*** Titor shows detailed knowledge of [[cholera]], strongly implying that it too is a problem in the future. He also stated that he would only drink [[bottled water]], or water which he had filtered himself through boiling.
*** Cures for [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]] have not been found, although large progress has taken place. [[Viral therapy]] is used to curb the spread of cancer through the body, strongly implying that cancer is indeed [[Genetics|genetic]] in [[nature]].

==Larry Haber==
Lawrence Haber is an entertainment [[lawyer]] based in [[Celebration, Florida]], whose office claims that in late 2000-early 2001 was visited by certain individuals claiming to be personally or directly involved with the "John Titor Phenomenon". Haber has since kept close contact with these individuals (of whom some advocates of Titor's prophecies speculate that they may be Titor's relatives living in the present) and has acted as their liaison on various websites and even one science fiction documetary in 2005. Haber has not revealed the identity of the individuals, as he claims it would be against their wishes.

Haber's address in Florida is the same as that of the '''John Titor Foundation''', publishers of ''John Titor, A Time Traveler’s Tale''.<ref>[http://www.larryflynt.com/notebook.php?id=95 John Titor's Startling Predictions]</ref>

==Evidence of hoaxing==

A cursory examination of the claims suggests several problems with the story, leading some to question Titor's claims and label him a [[fraud]] or a [[hoaxer]] {{Fact|date=June 2007}}.

For instance, he describes a future in which money is largely dispensed with in favor of communal bartering, but in other cases claims that money is widely used and they still have [[credit card]]s. These claims appear to be opposed, it does not seem obvious how one could operate a credit system with widespread barter because of the smaller number of cash transactions this would imply. In another post he speculated that today's money would be usable in his time, but this would be after the collapse of the federal government according to his own history, which would make the money worthless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/hoaxes/90359.html|title=Tackling John Titor, Time Traveller|date=2003-11-25|accessdate=2007-03-15}} {{Verify source|date=June 2007}}</ref>

Of particular interest is the fact that the device is implied to be a [[Tipler Cylinder]], but one well known "side effect" of this device is that it can only be used to travel to times in which the device already existed &ndash; Titor ''could'' travel into the past with one, but only to 2034, which is when he claimed it was first built.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A6345407 John Titor: a Time Traveller From The Year 2036?]</ref> It has been suggested that the description of the system has been copied with almost no modification from a particular work, the general science book ''[[Hyperspace (book)|Hyperspace]]'' written by Dr. [[Michio Kaku]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Brown|year=2003|url=http://communities.anomalies.net/forum/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Number/13443/page/1#Post13443|title=Dr. Robert Brown's Replies to Darby RE. Titor|publisher=The Anomalies Network Forums|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

The images posted by Titor are likewise problematic. The image of the [[laser pointer]]'s beam being "bent" has the obvious problem that objects around the beam are not bent. For instance, the framing of the window visible in the background shows no distortion, which would not be the case if there was a large gravity gradient in the area. Some have speculated the "beam" is a [[fiber optic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread62046/pg1|title=John Titor: Hoax|date=2004-06-26|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Titor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could emulate mainframes. Supporters have implied that this capability was a "secret" that was not known in 2000/1 when the posts were being made. However, this capability was actually widely known in the industry, and commented on in depth in numerous publications, both about the 5100 and APL in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/304/ibmsj3004C.pdf|year=1991|title=The IBM Family of APL Systems, IBM Systems Journal|accessdate=March 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref> References to this fact were also available on the internet as early as 1999. This is a fairly obscure bit of trivia, however, which suggests whoever was making the posts was familiar with the machine, or had an interest in [[retrocomputing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/|title=John Titor's Story|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Other predictions have simply proven not to be true. For instance, he stated that the [[Olympics Games]] would end with the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], but this proved contrary to subsequent real-world events as the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] were successfully held, though some people argue that he was only talking about the Summer Games.

In light of such predictive failings supporters have speculated, ''[[logical fallacies|ex post facto]]'', that the history relayed by Titor could have referred to ''one possible'' course for the future, suggesting that humans may have since created an [[alternate future]] by going about things differently. On the other hand, any statement can be supported by this idea; therefore this is precisely the sort of unfalsifiable claim that [[Karl Popper]] noted when he developed his thoughts on [[falsifiability]]; when faced with evidence that contradicts a claim, that claim is simply modified or removed outright to fix the problem. There is no limit to the modifications that could be carried out, thereby rendering it impossible to state that the facts disagree with the claims. For instance, if every one of the original claims turns out to be wrong, it could simply be stated that "Titor did his job". This is, as Popper pointed out, a key indication of a [[pseudoscience]].
In May 2007, Seattle-based dentist and time travel expert Dr. Bruce Goldberg, on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, brought up that Titor never tipped the world off regarding September, 11 2001.

==Supporters' claims==

Some who advocate Titor's predictions have various justifications for the apparent failings in them:

According to [[IBM]] [[engineer]] Bob Dubke, Titor's statements regarding the IBM 5100's little-known ability to [[emulation|emulate]] and debug [[mainframe]] systems were correct. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20051210175724/http://www.postbulletin.com/magazine/2004/08/index.shtml|title=Time traveller most likely to be spotted in Rochester, IBM 5100 Engineer Bob Dubke on hidden features|publisher=''Rochester Magazine''|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> It has been stated that this information was not publicly available when Titor made his declaration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com/Pages/5100.html|year=2005|title=News about the 5100 Computer|accessdate=March 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The [[2004 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], will be the last held according to Titor, who predicted that there would be "no official Olympics after 2004"<ref>http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/john_titor_archive_page7.html</ref>. All others will be cancelled due to rising global tensions. If correct, this means that the projected [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] planned for [[London]], [[England]], will not take place, and would mean that John Titor was referring only to the [[Summer Olympics]], since the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] were successfully held in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. Titor never specified whether he meant the [[Summer Olympics]] or the [[Winter Olympics]], or both, using only the word [[Olympics]], however, the Olympics starting and finishing in Athens by chance would probably be sufficiently serendipitous for many to quote this about the games, casually ignoring the Winter Olympics.

Some have stated that Titor has been proved a hoax<ref>http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread62046/pg1</ref> due to the fact that a Second American Civil War never broke out in 2004&ndash;2005. Titor claimed that these years would see the rise of great civil unrest (whether this has occurred is debatable in itself), and that actual civil war would not break out until 2008. Titor also claimed that "Waco"-like events (referring to the [[Waco Siege]] in 1993) would become commonplace<ref>http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/john_titor_archive_page7.html</ref>.

An alternative theory for the failure of the predictions could be that they are from his 'worldline', not ours.
