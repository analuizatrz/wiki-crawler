'''Madness''' are an [[England|English]] [[Pop music|pop]] band that formed in 1976.  A prominent band of the [[2 Tone]] [[ska]] revival of the late 1970s, Madness achieved most of its success in the 1980s, spending more weeks in the UK chart than any other group.

==Biography==
===The Beginning===
The band was formed in [[London]] in 1976 by [[Mike Barson]] (Monsieur Barso) on [[synthesizer|keyboards]] and [[vocals]], [[Chris Foreman]] (Chrissy Boy) on [[guitar]] and '[[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]] (Kix) on [[saxophone]] and vocals under the name ''The North London Invaders''. 

In 1978 they were joined by frontman [[Graham McPherson]] (Suggs) on vocals, [[Mark Bedford]] (Bedders) on [[bass guitar]] and [[Daniel Woodgate]]' (Woody) on [[drum kit|drums]].  After performing periodically as ''The North London Invaders'' and ''Morris and the Minors'', the group changed their name to ''Madness''. [[Carl Smyth]] (Chas Smash) joined in early 1980 on [[trumpet]] and vocals after being an unofficial member for some time.

The band's first single, released September 1, 1979 on [[2 Tone Records]], was "The Prince".  The song, written by Lee Thompson, was a tribute to the Jamaican ska musician [[Prince Buster]], after whose song, "Madness", the band had named themselves (and which was released as the B-side of "The Prince"). This was followed by the album ''[[One Step Beyond... (album)|One Step Beyond...]]'' in 1979, named after another Prince Buster song. The album stayed in the British charts for over a year, peaking at number 2. ''One Step Beyond...'' was released on [[Stiff Records]], which became the band's recording label.

From 1979 through 1988, the band released 25 singles (21 top 20 hits) and eight albums (including two compilation albums, both UK #1 albums) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. During the early 1980s, Madness was one of the most popular bands in Britain. In 1984 the band formed their own record label, [[Zarjazz Records]]. In 1985 the album ''[[Mad Not Mad]]'' was the first Madness album released on this label. The album was recorded at their own Liquidator studios, which also used to record the demos for the 1999 album ''[[Wonderful (Madness album)|Wonderful]]''.

The band's first 20 singles all made it into the UK top 20, as the band's self-described "nutty sound" evolved to include polished pop elements along with large doses of ska, [[reggae]], and other [[Caribbean music]]. The band only had one UK #1 single — "[[House of Fun]]" in 1982  — and narrowly missed the top spot in 1983 with the single "[[Wings of a Dove]]". They also made two guest appearances on the BBC comedy ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones ]]'', performing "House of Fun" in the first season episode [[Boring (Young Ones episode)|"Boring"]] (1982), and "[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]" in the second season episode [[Sick (Young Ones episode)|"Sick"]] (1984).

They had limited success in the [[United States]], with only two singles making the top 40. "Our House" peaked at #7 and "[[It Must Be Love]]" hit #33. However, the band had a strong underground following in the US, and their videos were a popular staple of [[MTV]]. Their videos, which were also popular on [[BBC]]'s [[Top of the Pops]], included much humour and storytelling. Years later, many American [[third wave ska]], bands such as [[No Doubt]] and [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] cited Madness as a major influence on their music.

===The late 1980s===
Mike Barson left the band and moved to Amsterdam in 1984, shortly after the release of their fifth album ''[[Keep Moving]]'' (UK #4). After Barson's departure, the band signed to [[Virgin Records]] and released the album ''[[Mad Not Mad]]'' (UK #16). They disbanded in 1986 after releasing the farewell single "[[(Waiting For) The Ghost Train]]," a song about the troubles in [[South Africa]] at the time. The song reached #18 in the UK charts and was the band's last top 20 of the 1980s. McPherson, Smyth, Thompson and Foreman went on to form '''The Madness''' and released a [[The Madness (album)|self-titled album]] on [[Virgin Records]] in 1988, reaching #66 in both the US and UK album charts.

===The 1990s===
In 1992, news spread that the original seven members would reform following the success of the Virgin compilation ''[[Divine Madness (Madness album)|Divine Madness]]'' featuring the band's most successful singles, which entered the UK album charts at #1. 

Madness performed to over 75,000 fans at the weekend concert festival ''Madstock'' at [[Finsbury Park]] London. The crowd danced so much that an earth tremor of over 4.5 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]]<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,816938,00.html Guardian article mentioning the Finsbury Park 'earthquake']</ref> was reported during the song "[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]". An album featuring the best of ''[[Madstock]]'' was released. A single — a cover of Jimmy Cliff's "The Harder They Come" — just failed to make the UK Top 40.

From 1992 to 1998, Madness reformed every two years for Madstock and an occasional Christmas tour of UK arenas. [[Suggs (singer)|Suggs]] also had a brief but successful solo career. His biggest hit, a cover of [[Simon and Garfunkel]]'s "[[Cecilia]]," sold  over 500,000 copies in the UK. Suggs also had a modestly successful TV career, becoming a regular on panel shows and hosting a [[celebrity]] [[karaoke]] show, "Night Fever". He currently has his own slot on Virgin Radio called "Suggs' Party Classics"

===1999 and early 2000s===
In 1999, Madness released their first original album in 14 years, ''[[Wonderful (Madness album)|Wonderful]],'' on Virgin Records. It became a top 20 UK album, spawning the singles "Johnny the Horse", "Drip Fed Fred" and "Lovestruck", the latter of which was a top 10 UK hit.

In 2002, ''[[Our House (musical)|Our House]]'', a musical based on Madness songs, took the stage at the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in [[west London]].  It ran from October 28, 2002 to August 16, 2003 and  had a companion book by Tim Firth. There was no cast album, but the show was recorded for DVD release near the end of the run. Madness played a role in the executive production of the show, and Suggs stepped into the production for a time, playing the central character's father. In 2003, the show won an [[Olivier Award]] for best new musical.  In 2006, a new production of the show toured [[Japan]], starting in [[Tokyo]].

===2004-2005===
In 2004, Madness played a series of concerts as ''The Dangermen,'' at The Dublin Castle in [[Camden Town]]. In late 2004, the band signed a one album deal with [[V2 Records]], and in August 2005 they released ''[[The Dangermen Sessions Vol. 1]]'', an album of cover songs that reached #11 in the UK charts. The single "Shame and Scandal" became a success in [[France]], and reached #12, and #81 in the official world top 100 singles. The album was the band's first not to be produced by Langer and Winstanley.

In May 2005, guitarist [[Chris Foreman]] left the band, citing "being a petty time-consuming bollock" as the reason.

===2006===
As of 2006, the band was working on their first original album in seven years. It was being produced by Clive Langer and [[White Stripes]] producer [[Liam Watson]], and was due for release in 2007. In the summer of 2006, Madness toured Europe and Japan. On July 28, 2006, Madness performed at The Fuji Rock Festival, a three-day festival held at the Naeba Ski Resort. At the 2006 [[Reading Festival]], Madness drummer Dan Woodgate appeared on stage with [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], performing the song 'The Outsiders'. 

In October 2006, Madness launched their official [[MySpace]] page with news that they planned to release their new single entitled "Sorry" in December. Madness performed at the Personal Fest 2006 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on November 17, 2006. On November 30, 2006, the band confirmed that [[Chris Foreman]] was returning to play in Madness' forthcoming UK Christmas tour. On December 2, 2006, Madness performed "It Must Be Love" on the BBC show "Strictly Come Dancing".

They started a UK tour at the Brixton academy on December 7, 2006 and had their last night of their UK tour at [[Wembley Arena|Wembley Arena]] on December 20<sup>th</sup> 2006.  The tour was recorded by concertlive.co.uk and limited edition live albums were released of all the performances of the tour
