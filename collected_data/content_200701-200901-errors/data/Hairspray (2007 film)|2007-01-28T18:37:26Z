'''''Hairspray''''' is a film adaptation of the [[musical theatre|Broadway musical]] of the [[Hairspray (musical)|same name]]. The Broadway musical was made after the [[Hairspray (film)|1988 film]]; thus the 2007 film is not technically a direct remake of the 1988 film but rather is an adaptation of the Broadway musical, which, in turn, was an adaptation of the 1988 film. The 2007 film is produced by Zadan/Meron Productions in the [[United States]] and will be distributed by [[New Line Cinema]].

==Plot synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
Set in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in the [[1960s]], a "pleasantly plump" high school overweight adolescent, Tracy Turnblad ([[Nicole Blonsky]]) goes from being an outsider to celebrity trendsetter. It is the story of a girl, Tracy, whose dream is to dance on the ''Corny Collins Show'', a local TV dance program based on the real-life ''[[Buddy Dean Show]]'' in Baltimore. She gets a chance on the show and becomes a celebrity overnight, and launches a campaign to racially integrate the ''Corny Collins Show''. Gladly, she has the help from her mother Edna ([[John Travolta]]), father Wilbur ([[Christopher Walken]]), local DJ Motormouth Maybelle ([[Queen Latifah]]), and Motormouth's kids Seaweed ([[Elijah Kelley]]) and Lil' Inez ([[Taylor Parks]]), but she also has to deal with the constant "raggings-on" of rival dancer Amber Von Tussle ([[Brittany Snow]]) and her mother Velma ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) who will stop at nothing to see that Tracy fails in her efforts. However, after referring to Tracy, in front of Corny Collins ([[James Marsden]]) as a "Trash-Can," Amber is given demerit points and loses her on-air crush, Link Larkin ([[Zac Efron]]), to Tracy.

==Production==
An open casting call was announced to cast unknowns in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[New York City]], and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Parks was chosen for the role of Lil' Inez, and Blonsky and Kelley were chosen to play Tracy and Seaweed.

Filming took place in [[Toronto]], and [[Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] from [[September 5]] to [[December 8]], [[2006]]<ref name="canada">{{cite web | title=Canada.com | work=Summer of stars | url=http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=9f391590-9a3f-4f6e-90da-e8328b66219c&k=14936 | accessdate=June 25 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>, with the rest of the production and location settings being done in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] (the film's setting) in-between and after the Canadian scenes. The majority of the filming was done in Canada rather than Baltimore because of lower costs in Canada and because Canada was better equipped with the soundstages needed to film a musical. They will also do some of the post-production, including some of the musical numbers, in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. 

The decision to do the film in Canada has upset not only fans of both the original film and Broadway musical, but also the residents and officials of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, who were hoping that the remake would generate revenues. Even Waters, who also served as consultant on the remake had mixed feelings about it; although he saw no problems with it being done in Canada, he did joke about it by saying, "At least they didn't change the lyrics (in the musical) to 'Good Morning Toronto.'"

Scenes in [[Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], were shot between [[November 22]] to [[December 2]] at the old Queen Victoria School. The school is scheduled to be demolished after film production is completed.
On the movie's official blog it stated that the movie will go into theatres on July 20, 2007.

==Trivia== 
 	 
*The movie's logo and colors were very similar to the 1988 film's logo and the Broadway show's logo colors when it was unveiled by New Line in the summer of 2006, but the studio has since modified it with a new logo as a way to distinguish the new film from both the original film and the musical.
	 
*[[John Waters]], the director of the original ''Hairspray'' film (in which he played a deranged psychologist that tried to "cure" Penny Pingleton), will be making a cameo in the 2007 version as the "flasher who lives next door".
 	 
*[[Ricki Lake]], who played Tracy Turnblad in the 1988 version, will also make a cameo as a William Morris talent agent who appears at the Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962 pageant. 
	 
*Filming wrapped on December 2, 2006, and most cast members have returned home during post-production. 
	 
*[[Jerry Stiller]] played Wilbur Turnblad (Tracy's father and Edna's husband) in the 1988 film but will be playing Mr. Pinky in the 2007 film.
 	 
*More recently, Tony-award winner [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]], who originated Tracy Turnblad in the Broadway version, will also have a cameo in the movie. This will be a small reunion of sorts between Lake and Winokur, since the latter performed "Good Morning Baltimore" on Lake's [[Ricki Lake (talk show)|talk show]] back in 2002.
 	 
*On the official "Hairspray Blog", it lists the names of the new Council Members. Coincidentally, some of the names include Jessie, Becky, Joey and Vicki; all which are the names of characters on [[Full House]].
