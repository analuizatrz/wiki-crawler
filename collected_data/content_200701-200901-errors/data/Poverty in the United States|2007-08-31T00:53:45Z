'''[[Poverty]]  in the United States''' of people whose annual family income is less than a "[[poverty line]]" set by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].  Poverty is a condition in which a person or community is deprived of or lacks the essentials for a minimum standard of well being and life. An absolute poverty measure was developed in the mid 1960s as part of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[War on poverty]].  Based on this measure, the poverty line is set at approximately three times the annual cost of a nutritionally adequate [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. It varies by [[family]] size and is updated yearly to reflect changes in the [[consumer price index]].<ref>Sawhill, I.V.

Currently roughly 13% of the US population fall below the federal poverty threshold. There is however some [[controversy]] regarding the federal [[poverty]] line, arguing that it either understates or overstates the problem of poverty. The poverty rate in the United States is one of the highest among the post-industrialized [[developed world]].<ref name="The Guardian, [[American]] poverty rate among the highest in the developed world">{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1712965,00.html|title=The Guardian, American poverty rate among the highest in the developed world|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref>  It should be noted that poverty rates only provide a snap-shot of the percentage of persons who are currently poor. Poverty in the U.S. is cyclical in nature, with individuals rising above and falling below the poverty threshold from time to time; as a result, far more than 13% of the population fall below the poverty line at some point over a given period of years.

"While in any given year 12 to 15 percent of the population is poor, over a ten-year period 40 percent experience poverty in at least one year because most poor people cycle in and out of poverty; they don't stay poor for long periods. Poverty is something that happens to the working class, not some marginal 'other' on the fringes of society." - Michael Zweig, ''What's Class Got to do With It, American Society in the Twenty-first Century'', 2004

Those under the age of 18 were the most likely to be impoverished. In 2001 the poverty rate for minors in the United States was the highest in the industrialized world, with 14.8% of all minors and 30% of African American minors living below the poverty threshold. Additionally, the standard of living for those in the bottom 10% was lower in the U.S. than in any other developed nation except the United Kingdom, which had the lowest standard of living for impoverished children.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

[[Image:Homeless - American Flag.jpg|thumb|250px|The homeless make poverty more visible in the United States.]]

There are three versions of the federal poverty measure: the poverty thresholds (which are the primary version) and the poverty guidelines. The [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] issues the poverty thresholds, which are generally used for statistical purposes&mdash;for example, to estimate the number of people in poverty nationwide each year and classify them by type of residence, race, and other social, economic, and demographic characteristics. The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] issues the poverty guidelines for administrative purposes&mdash;for instance, to determine whether a person or family is eligible for assistance through various federal programs.<ref>Fisher, G.M. (2003) [http://www.census.gov/hhes/poverty/povmeas/papers/orshansky.html The Development of the Orshansky Poverty Thresholds]. Accessed: 2003-12-27</ref>

Since the 1960s, the United States Government has defined poverty in absolute terms.  When the [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] administration declared "[[war on poverty]]" in 1964, it chose an absolute measure.  The "[[Poverty line in the United States|absolute poverty line]]" is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be ''lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health.''

The "Orshansky Poverty Thresholds" form the basis for the current measure of poverty in the U.S.  [[Mollie Orshansky]] was an economist working for the [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA).  Her work appeared at an opportune moment.   Orshansky's article was published later in the same year that Johnson declared war on poverty.  Since her measure was absolute (i.e., did not depend on other events), it made it possible to objectively answer whether the U.S. government was "winning" this war.  The newly formed [[United States Office of Economic Opportunity]] adopted the lower of the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical, planning, and budgetary purposes in May 1965. 

The Bureau of the Budget (now the [[Office of Management and Budget]]) adopted Orshansky's definition for statistical use in all Executive departments in 1965. The measure gave a range of income cutoffs, or thresholds, adjusted for factors such as family size, sex of the family head, number of children under 18 years old, and farm or non-farm residence.  The economy food plan (the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the [[Department of Agriculture]]) was at the core of this definition of poverty.<ref name=census>[http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/defs/poverty.html Poverty Definition] U.S. Census Bureau. Accessed: 2003-12-27.</ref> 

The Department of Agriculture found that families of three or more persons spent about one third of their after-tax income on food.  For these families, poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan.  Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two-person households and persons living alone.  Annual updates of the SSA poverty thresholds were based on price changes in the economy food plan.   

Two changes were made to the poverty definition in 1969.  Thresholds for non-farm families were tied to annual changes in the [[Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) rather than changes in the cost of the economy food plan.  Farm thresholds were raised from 70 to 85% of the non-farm levels.

In 1981, further changes were made to the poverty definition.  Separate thresholds for "farm" and "female-householder" families were eliminated.  The largest family size category became "nine persons or more."<ref name=census />

Apart from these changes, the U.S. government's approach to measuring poverty has remained static for the past forty years.

===Recent poverty rate and guidelines===
The official poverty rate in the U.S. has increased for four consecutive years, from a 26-year low of 11.3% in [[2000]] to 12.7% in [[2004]].  This means that 37.0 million people were below the official poverty thresholds in 2004.  This is 5.4 million more than in 2000.  The poverty rate for children under 18 years old increased from 16.2% to 17.8% over that period.
The 2006 poverty rate was measured according to the [[HHS]] Poverty Guidelines<ref>{{cite web | title=www.hhs.gov | work=The 2006 HHS Poverty Guidelines | url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/06poverty.shtml | accessmonthday=May 09 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> which are illustrated in the table below.

===Relative measures of poverty===
[[Image:Poverty by Age.png|thumb|400px|The poverty rate for selected age groups. Those under the age of 18 are most likely to fall below the poverty threshold.<ref name="US Census Bureau, report on income, poverty and insurance for 2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2006pubs/p60-231.pdf|title=US Census Bureau, report on income, poverty and insurance for 2005|accessdate=2006-01-19}}</ref>]]
Another way of looking at poverty is in ''relative'' terms. "Relative poverty" can be defined as ''having significantly less access to income and wealth than other members of society.''  Therefore, the relative poverty rate can directly be linked to income inequality. When the standard of living among those in more financially advantageous positions rises while that of those considered poor stagnates, the relative poverty rate will reflect such growing income inequality and increase. Conversely, the poverty rate can ''decrease,'' with low income people coming to have less wealth and income if wealthier people's wealth is reduced by a larger percentage than theirs. In 1959, a family at the poverty line had an income that was 42.64% of the median income. Thus, a poor family in 1999 had ''relatively'' less income and therefore ''relatively'' less purchasing power than wealthier members of society in 1959, and, therefore, "poverty" had increased. But, because this is a relative measure, this is not saying that a family in 1999 with the same amount of wealth and income as a family from 1959 had less purchasing power than the 1959 family.

In the EU, "relative poverty" is defined as an income below 60% of the national [[median]] equalized [[disposable income]] after social transfers for a comparable household. In Germany, for example, the official relative poverty line for a single adult person in 2003 was 938 euros per month (11,256 euros/year, $12,382 PPP. West Germany 974 euros/month, 11,688 euros/year, $12,857 PPP). For a family of four with two children below 14 years the poverty line was 1969.8 euros per month ($2,167 PPP) or 23,640 euros ($26,004 PPP) per year. According to [[Eurostat]] the percentage of people in Germany living at risk of poverty (relative poverty) in 2004 was 16% (official national rate 13.5% in 2003). Additional definitions for poverty in Germany are "poverty" (50% median) and "strict poverty" (40% median, national rate 1.9% in 2003). Generally the percentage for "relative poverty" is much higher than the quota for "strict poverty". The U.S concept is best comparable to "strict poverty". By European standards the official (relative) poverty rate in the United States would be significantly higher than it is by the U.S. measure. A research paper from the [[OECD]] calculates the relative poverty rate for the United States at 16% for 50% median of disposable income and nearly 24% for 60% of median disposable income<ref name="Michael Foerster/Marco Mira d'Ercole">Michael Foerster/Marco Mira d'Ercole, "Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries in the Second Half of the 1990s", OECD Social, employment and migration working papers No. 22, Paris 2005, page 22, figure 6. </ref> (OECD average: 11% for 50% median, 16% for 60% median).

=== The income distribution and relative poverty ===
Although the relative approach theoretically differs largely from the Orshansky definition, crucial variables of both poverty definitions are more similar than often thought. First, the so-called standardization of income in both approaches is very similar. To make incomes comparable among households of different sizes, [[equivalence scales]] are used to standardise household income to the level of a single person household. In Europe, the modified [[OECD]] equivalence scale is used, which takes the combined value of 1 for the head of household, 0.5 for each additional household member older than 14 years and 0.3 for children. When compared to the US Census poverty lines, which is based on a defined basket of goods, for the most prevalent household types both standardization methods show to be very similar. 

Secondly, if the height of the poverty threshold in Western-European countries is not always higher than the Orshansky threshold for a single person family. The actual Orchinsky poverty line for single person households in the US ($9645 in 2004) is very comparable to the relative poverty line in many Western-European countries (Belgium 2004: €9315), while price levels are also similar.  The reason why relative poverty measurement causes high poverty levels in the US, as demonstrated by Förster<ref name="Michael Foerster/Marco Mira d'Ercole">Michael Foerster/Marco Mira d'Ercole, "Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries in the Second Half of the 1990s", OECD Social, employment and migration working papers No. 22, Paris 2005, page 22, figure 6. </ref>, is caused by distributional effects rather than real differences in wellbeing among EU-countries and the USA. The median household income is much higher in the US than in Europe due to the wealth of the middle classes in the US, from which the poverty line is derived. Although the paradigm of relative poverty is most valuable, this comparison of poverty lines show that the higher prevalence of relative poverty levels in the US are not an indicator of a more severe poverty problem but an indicator of larger inequalities between rich middle classes and the low-income households. It is therefor not correct to state that the US income distribution is characterised by a large proportion of households in poverty; it is characterized by relatively large income inequality but also high levels of prosperity of the middle classes.The 2007 poverty threshold for a three member family is 17,070

==Food security==
Eighty-nine percent of American households were food secure throughout the entire year 2002, meaning that they had access, at all times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. The remaining households were food insecure at least some time during that year. The prevalence of food insecurity rose from 10.7% in 2001 to 11.1% in 2002, and the prevalence of food insecurity with hunger rose from 3.3% to 3.5%. This report, based on data from the December 2002 food security survey, provides statistics on the food security of U.S. households, as well as on how much they spent for food and the extent to which food-insecure households participated in Federal and community food assistance programs.

There are numerous perceived direct and indirect causes of [[poverty]] in the [[United States]]. They include:

* The conservative Heritage Foundation speculates that illegal immigration increases job competition among low wage earners, both native and foreign born. Additionally many first generation immigrants, namely those without a high school diploma, are also living in poverty themselves.<ref name="Heritage Foundation's views of immigration and poverty">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Immigration/SR9.cfm#_ftn2|title=Heritage Foundation's views of immigration and poverty|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>
* Unfavorable economic conditions
* [[Mental illness]] and [[disability]]
* Lack of educational attainment and skill
* [[Substance abuse]]
* Birth of a child
* [[Domestic abuse]]
* Natural or other disasters 
* [[Crime]]
* A survey done by [[Michigan State University]] found that a slight majority of American households with annual incomes of $70,000 or more believed that the two principal problems of poverty are lack of work ethic and a minimum wage that is too low.<ref name="MDU study of affluent views on poverty">{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.msu.edu/site/indexer/content|title=MDU study of affluent views on poverty|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>
* [[Institutional racism]]: The gross disparities among impoverished people in the United States along racial lines have led many to speculate that historic and/or ongoing institutional racism is responsible for much of the poverty in the United States today.
* Limited job opportunities appear to exist for significant subgroups of some races and ethnic groups. This is reflected by the low-income nature of large sections of the economy, as divided along racial/ethnic lines: 21% of all children in the [[United States]] live in poverty, but 46% of [[African American]] children and 40% of [[Latino]] children live in poverty.<ref>Center for the Future of Children, The Future of Children. Vol. 7, No 2, 1997.</ref>
* Region. Many rural areas, especially in the South and [[Appalachia]] have a high poverty rate due to limited job opportunities, historical issues, and sometimes resistance to change, among other things.

==Controversy==<!-- This section is linked from [[Poverty in the United States]] -->
There has been significant disagreement about poverty in the United States; particularly over how poverty ought to be defined. Using radically different definitions, two major groups of advocates dispute whether or not more resources are needed to help lessen poverty. Liberals generally claim that more, or at least the presently dedicated, resources are needed to alleviate poverty. Conservatives may argue that the condition of the poor does not presently require the dedication of more resources and may wish to abolish and curtail the American social safety net.

Much of the debate about poverty focuses on statistical measures of poverty and the clash between advocates and opponents of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs and government regulation of the [[free market]]. Since measures can be either absolute or relative, it is possible that advocates for the different sides of this debate are basing their arguments on different ways of measuring poverty. It is often claimed that poverty is understated, yet there are some who also believe it is overstated; thus the accuracy of the current poverty threshold guidelines is subject to debate and considerable concern.

A recent study published in the ''Washington Times'' showed how many of the appliances modern middle class and working class households take for granted are lacking in poverty stricken households. Among the households constituting the bottom ten percent, 36% were lacking [[microwave oven]]s, 53% were lacking clothes dryers and 79% were lacking a [[computer]]. Furthermore only 19% were in possession of a garbage disposal and only 23% owned a [[dishwasher]]. Color televisions, VCRs, and stereos were among the more commonly found mundane appliances with 91% of households in the bottom ten percent owning a color television, 55% owning a VCR, and 42% owning a stereo.<ref name="Appliances among the poor">{{cite web|url=http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20031005-111129-3478r.htm|title=Appliances among the poor|accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref>

===Concerns regarding accuracy===
In recent years, there have been a number of concerns raised about the official U.S. poverty measure.  In 1995, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]'s Committee on National Statistics convened a panel on measuring poverty.  The findings of the panel were that "the official poverty measure in the United States is flawed and does not adequately inform policy-makers or the public about who is poor and who is not poor."

The panel was chaired by Robert Michael, former Dean of the Harris School of the [[University of Chicago]].  According to Michael, the official U.S. poverty measure "has not kept pace with far-reaching changes in society and the economy."  The panel proposed a model based on [[disposable income]]:  

<blockquote>''According to the panel's recommended measure, income would include, in addition to money received, the value of non-cash benefits such as food stamps, school lunches and public housing that can be used to satisfy basic needs. The new measure also would subtract from gross income certain expenses that cannot be used for these basic needs, such as income taxes, child-support payments, medical costs, health-insurance premiums and work-related expenses, including child care.''</blockquote>

===Understating poverty===
Many sociologists and government officials have argued that poverty in the [[United States]] is understated, meaning that there are more [[household]]s living in actual poverty than there are households below the poverty threshold.<ref name="Dealing with Diversity">{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =Pearlie Strother-Adams  | year =2001  | title =Dealing with Diversity  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company  | location =Chicago, IL | id = 0-7872-8145-X}}</ref> A recent [[National Public Radio|NPR]] report states that as much as 30% of Americans have trouble making ends meet and other advocates have made supporting claims that the rate of actual poverty in the US is far higher than that calculated by using the poverty threshold.<ref name="Dealing with Diversity">{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =Pearlie Strother-Adams  | year =2001  | title =Dealing with Diversity  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company  | location =Chicago, IL|id = 0-7872-8145-X}}</ref> The issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with both a [[Real estate pricing|high cost of living]] and a high poverty rate such as [[California]] where the [[Real estate pricing|median home price]] in May 2006 was determined to be $564,430.<ref name="California median home price">{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060627/20060627005927.html?.v=1|title=California median home price|accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> With half of all homes being priced above the half million dollar mark and prices in urban areas such as [[San Francisco]], [[San Jose, CA|San Jose]] or [[Los Angeles]] being higher than the state average, it is almost impossible for not just the poor but also [[lower middle class]] worker to afford decent housing {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and no possibility of home ownership. In the [[Monterey County, California#Home Prices|Monterey area]], where the low-pay industry of agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of the population lacks a college education the median home price was determined to be $723,790, requiring an [[Household income in the United States|upper middle class income]] which only roughly 20% of all households in the county boast.<ref name="California median home price">{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060627/20060627005927.html?.v=1|title=California median home price|accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref><ref name="Monterey County income distribution">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=05000US06053&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP32&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en|title=Monterey County income distribution|accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> Such fluctuations in local markets are however not considered in the Federal poverty threshold and thus leave many who live in poverty-like conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor.

===Overstating poverty===
The federal poverty line also excludes income other than cash income, especially welfare benefits.  Thus, if [[food stamps]] and [[public housing]] were successfully raising the standard of living for poverty stricken individuals, then the poverty line figures would not shift since they do not consider the income equivalents of such entitlements.<ref>[http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20060906-100020-4785r.htm Poor Poverty Yardsticks] by Rea Hederman, [[Heritage Foundation]], ''Washington Post.'' September 7, 2006. Accessed: 2007-02-18 </ref>

A 1993 study of low income single mothers titled ''Making Ends Meet,'' by Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], showed that the mothers spent more than their reported incomes. According to Edin, they made up the difference through contributions from family members, absent boyfriends, off-the-book jobs, and church charity.

According to Edin: "No one avoided the unnecessary expenditures, such as the occasional trip to the [[Dairy Queen]], or a pair of stylish new [[Athletic shoe|sneaker]]s for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them, or the Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will be out on the street if they are not watching TV."<ref>[http://192.211.16.13/curricular/mpafp1999/Poverty.htm Devising New Math to Define Poverty] by Louis Uchitelle, ''New York Times.'' 1999-10-18.

== Fighting poverty ==
There have been many governmental and [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental]] efforts to make an impact on poverty and its effects. These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus.  They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children, autistics, immigrants, or the [[homeless]]. Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods, such as [[advocacy]], [[education]], [[social work]], [[legislation]], direct service or [[Charitable organization|charity]], and [[community organizing]].  

Politicians often make fighting poverty a central part of their [[political platform]]s.

- From 1968 to 1979 a massive social experiment was undertaken in the U.S.
[http://www.usbig.net/papers/013-Sheahen.doc : The Negative Income Tax Experiments of the 1970s in the USA]
The four experiments were in:

1 Urban areas in [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] from 1968-1972 (1300 families).

2 Rural areas in [[Iowa]] and [[North Carolina]] from 1969-1973 (800 families).

3 [[Gary, Indiana]] from 1971-1974 (1800 families).

4 [[Seattle]] and [[Denver]], from 1970-1978 (4800 families).

In April 2007 The [[Center for American Progress]], a liberal think tank, released a report [http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/04/poverty_report.html : "From Poverty to Prosperity: A National Strategy to Cut Poverty in Half"]. It recommends 12 steps to cut poverty in half by 2017. 

1. Raise and index the minimum wage to half the average hourly wage. At $5.15, the federal [[minimum wage]] is at its lowest level in real terms since 1956. The federal minimum wage was once 50 percent of the average wage but is now 30 percent of that wage. Congress should restore the minimum wage to 50 percent of the average wage, about $8.40 an hour in 2006. Doing so would help nearly 5 million poor workers and nearly 10 million other low-income workers.

2. Expand the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] and [[Child Tax Credit]]. As an earnings supplement for low-income working families, the EITC raises incomes and helps families build assets. The Child Tax Credit provides a tax credit of up to $1,000 per child, but provides no help to the poorest families. We recommend tripling the EITC for childless workers and expanding help to larger working families. We recommend making the Child Tax Credit available to all low- and moderate-income families. Doing so would move as many as 5 million people out of poverty.

3. Promote [[Trade union|unionization]] by enacting the [[Employee Free Choice Act]]. The Employee Free Choice Act would require employers to recognize a union after a majority of workers signs cards authorizing union representation and establish stronger penalties for violation of employee rights. The increased union representation made possible by the Act would lead to better jobs and less poverty for American workers.

4.  Guarantee child care assistance to low-income families and promote early education for all. We propose that the federal and state governments guarantee child care help to families with incomes below about $40,000 a year, with expanded tax help to higher-earning families. At the same time, states should be encouraged to improve the quality of early education and broaden access for all children. Our child care expansion would raise employment among low-income parents and help nearly 3 million parents and children escape poverty.

5. Create 2 million new “opportunity” housing vouchers, and promote equitable development in and around central cities. Nearly 8 million Americans live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty where at least 40 percent of residents are poor. Our nation should seek to end concentrated poverty and economic segregation, and promote regional equity and inner-city revitalization. We propose that over the next 10 years the federal government fund 2 million new “opportunity vouchers” designed to help people live in opportunity-rich areas. Any new affordable housing should be in communities with employment opportunities and high-quality public services, or in gentrifying communities. These housing policies should be part of a broader effort to pursue equitable development strategies in regional and local planning efforts, including efforts to improve schools, create affordable housing, assure physical security, and enhance neighborhood amenities.

6. Connect disadvantaged and disconnected youth with school and work. About 1.7 million poor youth ages 16 to 24 were out of school and out of work in 2005. We recommend that the federal government restore Youth Opportunity Grants to help the most disadvantaged communities and expand funding for effective and promising youth programs—with the goal of reaching 600,000 poor disadvantaged youth through these efforts. We propose a new Upward Pathway program to offer low-income youth opportunities to participate in service and training in fields that are in high-demand and provide needed public services.

7. Simplify and expand [[Pell Grant]]s and make higher education accessible to residents of each state. Low-income youth are much less likely to attend college than their higher income peers, even among those of comparable abilities. Pell Grants play a crucial role for lower-income students. We propose to simplify the Pell grant application process, gradually raise Pell Grants to reach 70 percent of the average costs of attending a four-year public institution, and encourage institutions to do more to raise student completion rates. As the federal government does its part, states should develop strategies to make postsecondary education affordable for all residents, following promising models already underway in a number of states.

8. Help former prisoners find stable employment and reintegrate into their communities. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. We urge all states to develop comprehensive reentry services aimed at reintegrating former prisoners into their communities with full-time, consistent employment. 

9. Ensure equity for low-wage workers in the [[Unemployment Insurance]] system. Only about 35 percent of the unemployed, and a smaller share of unemployed low-wage workers, receive unemployment insurance benefits. We recommend that states (with federal help) reform “monetary eligibility” rules that screen out low-wage workers, broaden eligibility for part-time workers and workers who have lost employment as a result of compelling family circumstances, and allow unemployed workers to use periods of unemployment as a time to upgrade their skills and qualifications.

10. Modernize means-tested benefits programs to develop a coordinated system that helps workers and families. A well-functioning safety net should help people get into or return to work and ensure a decent level of living for those who cannot work or are temporarily between jobs. Our current system fails to do so. We recommend that governments at all levels simplify and improve benefits access for working families and improve services to individuals with disabilities. The Food Stamp Program should be strengthened to improve benefits, eligibility, and access. And the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program should be reformed to shift its focus from cutting caseloads to helping needy families find sustainable employment.

11. Reduce the high costs of being poor and increase access to financial services. Despite having less income, lower-income families often pay more than middle and high-income families for the same consumer products. We recommend that the federal and state governments should address the foreclosure crisis through expanded mortgage assistance programs and by new federal legislation to curb unscrupulous practices. And we propose that the federal government establish a $50 million Financial Fairness Innovation Fund to support state efforts to broaden access to mainstream goods and financial services in predominantly low-income communities.

12. Expand and simplify the Saver’s Credit to encourage saving for education, homeownership, and retirement. For many families, saving for purposes such as education, a home, or a small business is key to making economic progress. We propose that the federal “Saver’s Credit” be reformed to make it fully refundable. This Credit should also be broadened to apply to other appropriate savings vehicles intended to foster asset accumulation, with consideration given to including individual development accounts, children’s saving accounts, and college savings plans.
