The spider family '''Hexathelidae''', the only family in the super-family '''Hexatheloidea''', is one of two families (along with ''[[Funnel-web tarantula|Dipluridae]]'') of spiders known as '''funnel-web tarantulas'''.  This order is sometimes referred to as the '''venomous funnel-web tarantulas''', due to the inclusion of the [[Australasian funnel-web spider]]s, including the notorious ''[[Atrax robustus]]'', or Sydney funnel-web spider, but not all specimens in Hexathelidae are dangerous to humans. 

== Description ==
These spiders are medium-to-large in size, with body lengths ranging from 1cm to 5cm (0.4" to 2"). The body is typically three times longer than it is wide. They are darkly colored, ranging from black to brown, with a glossy carapace covering the front part of the body. Like the related [[Funnel-web tarantula|diplurid]] spiders, the hexathelids have generally long [[spinneret]]s; this is especially true of ''A. robustus''.  The eyes of these spiders are close together.

Like other '''Mygalomorphae''', (also called the ''Orthognatha'' an [[infraorder]] of [[spider]]s which includes the true [[tarantula]]s), these spiders have [[fang]]s which point straight down and do not cross each other (cf [[araneomorph]]).  They have ample [[poison]] glands that lie entirely within their [[chelicerae]]. Their chelicerae and fangs are large and powerful.  Although they are rather small compared to the true [[tarantula]]s, as venomous specimens they should not be handled without taking substantial precautions because their fangs have been known to penetrate fingernails and soft shoes, resulting in dangerous bites.

==Range and habitat==
Most hexathelids are found in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Asia]]. One species is known for the Mediterranean region and two from South America. Two species occur in Central Africa.

Hexathelids typically live in burrows, which are constructed in the ground or in tree hollows.  An elaborately constructed burrow entrance is common.  These spiders construct a [[funnel]] shaped [[spider web|web]] and lurk for [[prey]] in the small end of the funnel. They frequently search for a place to nest under [[house|human dwellings]], or under nearby [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[log]]s, or other similar objects. They are [[nocturnal|most active at night]].

== Medical significance ==
There are three genera known to contain [[Spiders having medically significant venom|dangerous spiders]]--''[[Atrax]]'' and ''[[Hadronyche]]'' of [[Australia]] and the south Pacific, and ''[[Macrothele]]'', which contains some specimens considered dangerous in [[Taiwan]] and parts of eastern [[Asia]].
