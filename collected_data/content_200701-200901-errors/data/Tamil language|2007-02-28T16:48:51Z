'''Tamil''' (தமிழ் || Thamizh) is a [[classical language]] belonging to the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] family. It is the Dravidian language with the oldest extant literature. Spoken predominantly by [[Tamil people|Tamils]] in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], it has smaller communities of speakers in many other countries. As of 1996, it was the eighteenth most spoken language{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, with over 74 million speakers worldwide. It is one of the official [[languages of India]], [[Singapore]], and [[Sri Lanka]].

Tamil is one of the few living classical languages and has an unbroken literary [[tradition]] of over two [[millennium|millennia]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. The high level of [[diglossia]] exhibited by Tamil and the prestige accorded to classical Tamil have resulted in much of the vocabulary and forms of classical Tamil being preserved in modern literary Tamil, such that the higher registers of literary Tamil tend towards the classical language{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  The classical language also forms an important part of Tamil-medium education; for example, verses from the Tirukkural, a classical work, are taught in primary school. The ordinary form of the modern language used in speech and writing, in contrast, has undergone significant changes, to the extent that a person who has not learnt the higher literary form will have difficulty understanding it.

The name 'Tamil' is an anglicised form of the native name தமிழ் ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/t̪ɐmɨɻ/}}). The final letter of the name, usually transcribed as the lowercase '''l''' or '''zh''', is a [[retroflex]] r. In phonetic transcriptions, it is usually represented by the [[retroflex approximant]].

==History==
[[Image:Christian prayers in tamil on palm leaves.jpg|thumb|250px|A set of palm leaf manuscripts from the fifteenth century or the sixteenth century, containing [[Christianity|Christian]] [[prayer]]s in Tamil.]]
The origins of Tamil, like the other [[Dravidian languages]], are unknown, but unlike most of the other established literary [[Indian languages|languages of India]], are independent of [[Sanskrit]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Tamil has the oldest literature amongst the Dravidian languages (Hart, 1975), but dating the language and the literature precisely is difficult. Literary works in India or Sri Lanka were preserved either in [[palm leaf manuscript]]s (implying repeated copying and recopying) or through oral transmission, making direct dating impossible. [[chronology|External chronological records]] and internal linguistic evidence, however, indicate that the oldest extant works were probably composed sometime in the 2nd century CE.

The earliest extant text in Tamil is the [[Tolkāppiyam]], a work on poetics and grammar which describes the language of the classical period. The oldest portions of this book may date back to around 200 BCE (Hart, 1975). Apart from these, the earliest examples of Tamil writing we have today are rock inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, which are written in [[Tamil-Brahmi]], an adapted form of the [[Brahmi script]] (Mahadevan, 2003).

[[Linguistics|Linguists]] categorise [[Tamil literature]] and language into three periods: ancient (500 BCE to 700 CE), medieval (700 CE to 1500 CE) and modern (1500 CE to the present). During the medieval period, a number of Sanskrit [[loan word]]s were absorbed by Tamil, which many 20th century [[purist]]s, notably [[Parithimaar Kalaignar]] and [[Maraimalai Adigal]], later sought to remove. This movement was called ''thanith thamizh iyakkam'' (meaning ''pure Tamil movement''). As a result of this, Tamil in formal documents, public speeches and scientific discourses is largely free of Sanskrit loan words.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Classification==
Tamil is a member of the [[Tamil languages|Tamil language family]], which includes the [[Irula language|Irula]], [[Kaikadi language|Kaikadi]], [[Betta Kurumba language|Betta Kurumba]], [[Sholaga language|Sholaga]], and [[Yerukula language|Yerukula]] languages. This group is a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Malayalam languages]], which falls under a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Kodagu languages]], which in turn is a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Kannada languages]]. The Tamil-Kannada languages belong to the [[Southern Dravidian languages|southern]] branch of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language family]]. Tamil is most closely related to [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], spoken in the Indian state of [[Kerala]] which borders [[Tamil Nadu]]. Linguists estimate Malayalam separated from Tamil between the 8th and 10th centuries.

==Geographic distribution==
Tamil is the first language of the majority in the southern state of [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]], and in northern, eastern and northeastern [[Sri Lanka]]. The language is also spoken by small groups of minorities in other parts of these two countries, most notably in the Indian states of [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]] and [[Maharashtra]], and in [[Jaffna]],[[Colombo]] and the hill country of [[Sri Lanka]].

There are currently sizeable Tamil-speaking populations descended from them in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Asians in South Africa|South Africa]], and [[Mauritius]]. Many people in [[Guyana]], [[Fiji]], [[Suriname]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] have Tamil origins, but the language is spoken only by a small number there. (see [[Tamil diaspora]])

Groups of more recent emigrants as well as economic migrants such as engineering, IT, medical professionals and academics from the Sri Lanka and India - exist in [[Canada]] (especially [[Toronto]]), [[Australia]], the [[United States|USA]] and most western [[Europe|European]] countries.(see [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora]])

===Legal status===
Tamil is the [[Official Language]] of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and union territories of Puducherry and Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and is one of 23 nationally recognised Official Languages in the Constitution of [[India]]. Tamil is an official language of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Singapore]], and has constitutional recognition in [[South Africa]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Malaysia]].

In addition, with the creation in 2004 of a legal status for classical languages by the [[government of India]], Tamil became the first legally recognised classical language following a campaign by several Tamil associations supported by academics from India and abroad, most notably Professor [[George L. Hart]], who occupies the Chair in Tamil Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="Hart statement">[http://tamil.berkeley.edu/Tamil%20Chair/TamilClassicalLanguage/TamilClassicalLgeLtr.html Statement by George L. Hart]</ref> The recognition was announced by the [[President of India]], Dr. [[Abdul Kalam]], in a joint sitting of both houses of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] on [[June 6]], [[2004]].<ref name="Kalam speech">Item 41 of President Kalam's [http://presidentofindia.nic.in/scripts/eventslatest1.jsp?id=587 address to a joint sitting of both houses of Indian Parliament]</ref><ref name="BBC news">[[BBC]] news item on the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3667032.stm formal approval by the Indian Cabinet]</ref><ref name="TNgovt"> [[Tamil as a classic language: Report to Central Government by Tamil Nadu Government|the report]] submitted by Tamil Nadu State Government to Central Government of India to claim the Classic Language status.</ref>

===Spoken and literary variants===
[[Image:Genesis in a Tamil bible from 1723.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The opening of the book of Genesis in an 18th century Tamil [[bible]]. The language is centamil.]]
In addition to its various dialects, Tamil also exhibits a rather sharp [[diglossia]] between its formal or classic variety, called ''centamil'', and its [[colloquial]] form, called ''koduntamil'', a broad term which traditionally referred to all spoken Tamil dialects rather than any one standard form. Diglossia has existed in the language since ancient times - the language used in early [[Koil|temple]] inscriptions differs quite significantly from the language of classical poetry. In consequence, standard centamil is not based on the speech of any one region, a fact which has helped keep the written language mostly the same across various Tamil speaking regions.

In modern times, centamil is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of [[Tamil literature]] and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, koduntamil has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of ''centamil''. Most contemporary [[film|cinema]], [[theatre]] and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in ''koduntamil'', and many [[politician]]s use it to bring themselves closer to their audience.

Spoken dialects did not have much prestige: Tamils believed that the grammatical rules of literary ''centamil'' had been formulated by the gods and they were therefore seen as being the only correct speech (see, for example, Kankeyar, 1840). In contrast to most [[Europe]]an languages, therefore, Tamil did not have a standard spoken form for much of its history. In modern times, however, the increasing use of ''koduntamil'' has led to the emergence of unofficial 'standard' spoken dialects. In [[India]], the 'standard' ''koduntamil'' is based on 'educated non-brahmin speech', rather than on any one dialect (Schiffman, 1998), but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of [[Thanjavur]] and [[Madurai]]. In [[Sri Lanka]] the standard is based on the dialect of [[Jaffna]].

===Dialects===
Tamil dialects are mainly differentiated from each other by the fact that they have undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. Thus the word for "here" - ''ingu'' in [[Centamil]] (the classic variety) - has evolved into ''inge'' in the [[Kongu dialect]] of [[Coimbatore]] & [[Erode]], ''inga'' in the dialect of [[Thanjavur]], ''ingane'' in the dialect of [[Tirunelveli]], ''inguttu'' in the dialect of [[Ramanathapuram]], ''ingale'' and ''ingade'' in various northern dialects and ''ingai'' in some [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects|dialects of Sri Lanka]].

Although most Tamil dialects do not differ very significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in [[Sri Lanka]] retain many words that are not in everyday use in [[India]], and use many other words slightly differently. The dialect of the [[Iyer]]s of [[Palakkad]] has a large number of [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] loanwords,has also been influenced by Malayalam syntax and also has a distinct Malayalam accent. Finally, the [[Sanketi]], [[Hebbar Iyengars|Hebbar]] and [[Mandyam]] dialects, the former spoken by groups of Tamil [[Iyers]] and the latter two by [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] who migrated to [[Karnataka]] in the 11th century, retains many features of the [[Vaishnava paribasai]], a special form of Tamil designed in the 9th and 10th centuries to reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values.[[Bangalore]] also has its own version of Tamil,and is mainly spoken by the people whose mother tongue is not Tamil and infuses words from [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and even [[Hindi]].

Tamil dialects vary according to both region and community. Several [[caste]]s have their own dialects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. Some of these differences have begun to fade away in recent years as a result of the anti-casteist movement{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, but many traces remain and it is often possible to identify a person's [[caste]] by their speech.

The [[Ethnologue]] lists twenty-two current dialects of Tamil, including [[Adi Dravida]], [[Iyer|Aiyar]], [[Iyengar|Aiyangar]], Arava, Burgandi, Kasuva, Kongar, Korava, Korchi, Madrasi, Parikala, Pattapu Bhasha, [[SLT dialects|Sri Lanka Tamil]], Malaya Tamil, Burma Tamil, South Africa Tamil, [[Tigala|Tigalu]], Harijan, [[Sankethi language|Sankethi]], [[Hebbar Iyengars|Hebbar]], Tirunelveli, [[Tamil Muslim]]  and Madurai. 
Other known dialects are [[Kongu Nadu|Kongu]] and [[Kanyakumari|Kumari]],which are heavily influenced by [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]].

Although not a dialect, the Tamil spoken in [[Chennai]] (Capital of Tamil Nadu) infuses [[English Language|English]] words{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and is called [[Madras Bashai]].

==Writing system==
{{main|Tamil script}}
[[Image:History of Tamil script.jpg|thumb|right|300px|History of Tamil script.]]
Tamil is a [[phonetic]] language and is subject to well-defined rules of [[elision]] and [[euphony]]. The present script used to write Tamil text is believed to have evolved from the [[Brahmi]] script of the [[Ashoka]] era. Later, a southern variant of the Brahmi script ([[Tamil-Brahmi]]) evolved into the [[Grantha]] script, which was used to write both [[Sanskrit]] and Tamil texts. Between the 6th and 10th centuries, a new script called ''[[Vatteluttu]]'' (meaning ''curved letters'') or ''vettezhuthu'' (meaning ''letters that are cut'') evolved in order to make it easy for creating inscriptions on stone. The over dot, called puLLi was specially defined in Tamil Grammar Tolkappiyam to distinguish consonants from ligatures. During the print revolution, Veeramaamunivar made some changes to Tamil writing, such as placing vowel markers in both left and right of consonants. Around 1935, [[E.V.Ramaswamy Naicker]] suggested some changes to make it amenable to [[printing]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Some of these suggestions were incorporated by the [[M.G. Ramachandran]] government in 1978.

While the script was still evolving, many Sanskrit words were borrowed into Tamil. To facilitate writing these words, some characters from the Grantha script are still retained. However, there are many purists who would argue against the use of such characters as there are well-defined rules in the Tolkāppiyam{{Fact|date=February 2007}} for Tamilising [[loan word]]s.

==Sounds==
The Tamil [[alphabet]] distinguishes 12 [[vowel]]s and 18 [[consonant]]s. These combine to form 216 compound characters. There is one special character (''aaytha ezutthu''), giving a total of 247 characters.

{{listen|filename=Tamil tongue twister.ogg|title=A Tamil tongue twister|description=The sentence literally means: ''"An old pauper stepped on a banana peel, and slipped, slithered, and fell"'' |format=[[Ogg]]}}

===Vowels===
The vowels are called ''uyir ezhuthu'' (''uyir'' - life, ''ezhuthu'' - letter). The vowels are classified into short and long (five of each type) and two [[diphthong]]s.

The long (''nedil'') vowels are about twice as long as the short (''kuRil'') vowels. The [[diphthong]]s are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as the short vowels, though most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.

The [[diphthong]]s of Tamil are
:ai
:au

The vowels {{IPA|/ə/}}, {{IPA|/æː/}}, and {{IPA|/ɔː/}} are peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, occurring only in [[loanword]]s.

===Consonants===
The [[consonants]] are known as ''mey ezhuttu'' (mey-body, ezhuttu-letters).The [[consonant]]s are classified into three categories with six in each category: ''vallinam'' - hard, ''mellinam'' - soft or [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]], and ''idayinam'' - medium. Tamil has very restricted consonant clusters (eg: never word initial etc.) and has neither aspirated nor voiced [[stop consonant|stops]]. Some scholars have suggested that in ''Chenthamil'' (which refers to Tamil as it existed before [[Sanskrit]] words were borrowed), stops were voiceless when at the start of a word and voiced [[allophone|allophonically]] otherwise. However, no such distinction is observed by most modern Tamil speakers.

A chart of the Tamil consonant [[phoneme]]s in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"

|}

The sounds {{IPA|/b/, /d̪/, /ɖ/, /ɟ/, /g/, /f/, /ʂ/, /ɕ/, /x/}} are peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, being found only in loanwords and frequently replaced by native sounds.

===Special character===
[[Image:AayuthaEzhuthu.PNG|thumb|right|83px|Akh]]
The special character 'ஃ' (pronounced 'akh') is called ''āytham'' in the Tolkāppiyam (''see'' ''Tolkāppiyam'' 1:1:2). The ''āytham'' is rarely used by itself: it normally serves a purely grammatical function as an independent vowel form, the equivalent of the [[overdot diacritic]] of plain consonants. The rules of pronunciation given in the Tolkāppiyam suggest that the ''āytham'' could have [[Glottal stop|glottalised]] the sounds it was combined with. Although the character was common in classical Tamil, it fell out of use in the early modern period and is now very rare in written Tamil. It is occasionally used with a 'p' (as {{unicode|ஃப}}) to represent the phoneme [f]. It can also be used with 'j' to represent 'z' (see external link #2 - "Omniglot").

The ''āytham'' is also called ''ahenam'' (literally, 'the "ah" sound'). Its resemblance to the three dots that were found on [[shield]]s in mediaeval times, and the similarity of the name ''āytham'' to the word ''āyutham'' meaning 'weapon' or 'tool' has resulted in it often being called ''āyutha ezhuthu'' (literally, 'the war-weapon letter').

Many researchers now feel that the ''āytham'' is actually used to represent the [[voiced implosive]] (or closing part or the first half) of geminated voiced plosives inside a word. For example, a word written as 'mu-''āytham''-dee-dhu' (from MuLL+dheedhu) should be read as 'muddeedhu' (MuLL+dheedhu). (This [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] is in accordance with the [[Sandhi|puṇarci]] rules for [[agglutination]] in Tamil.) Thus the letter doesn't have a unique pronunciation ('akh') as commonly believed, but takes its pronunciation from the succeeding plosive in the word. Thus it doesn't have a separate place of origin in the oral cavity on its own, it shares the place of origin of the succeeding plosive. This is the reason why [[Tolkāppiyam]] calls it a 'Saarbezhuthu' (a ''dependent letter/sound'').

It is used to defend the mixing of other language words in Tamil.

===Phonology===
Unlike most other Indian languages, Tamil does not have [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants. The Tamil script does not have distinct letters for [[voiced]] and unvoiced [[plosives]], although both are present in the spoken language as [[allophone]]s--i.e., they are in [[complementary distribution]] and the places they can occur do not intersect. For example, the unvoiced plosive 'p' occurs at the beginning of the words and the voiced plosive 'b' cannot. In the middle of words, unvoiced plosives commonly occur as a [[geminated pair]] like -pp- , while voiced plosives do not usually come in pairs. Only the voiced plosives occur after a vowel, or after a corresponding nasal. Thus both the voiced and unvoiced plosives can be represented by the same script in Tamil without ambiguity, the script denoting only the place and broad manner of articulation (plosive, [[nasal consonant|nasal]], etc.). The Tolkāppiyam cites detailed rules as to when a letter is to be pronounced with voice and when it is to be pronounced unvoiced. The rule is identical for all plosives.

With the exception of one rule - the pronunciation of the letter ''c'' at the beginning of a word - these rules are largely followed even today in pronouncing ''centamil''. The position is, however, much more complex in relation to spoken ''koduntamil''. The pronunciation of southern dialects and the dialects of [[Sri Lanka]] continues to reflect these rules to a large extent, though not completely. In northern dialects, however, sound shifts have changed many words so substantially that these rules no longer describe how words are pronounced. In addition many, but not all, [[Sanskrit]] [[loan word]]s are pronounced in Tamil as they were in Sanskrit, even if this means that consonants which should be unvoiced according to the Tolkāppiyam are voiced.

[[Phonology|Phonologists]] are divided in their opinion over why written Tamil did not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced characters. One point of view is that Tamil never had [[conjunct consonant]]s or voiced [[stop consonant|stops]] - voice was rather the result of [[elision]] or [[sandhi]]. Consequently, unlike [[Indo-European languages]] and other [[Dravidian languages]], Tamil did not need separate characters for voiced consonants. A slightly different theory holds that voiced consonants were at one stage allophones of unvoiced consonants, and the lack of distinction between the two in the modern script merely reflects that.

====Elision====
[[Elision]] is the reduction in the duration of sound of a [[phoneme]] when preceded by or followed by certain other sounds. There are well-defined rules for elision in Tamil. They are categorised into different classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision.

==Grammar==
[[Image:TolkaappiyamExcerpt.png|thumb|250px|An excerpt from [[Tolkaappiyam]].]]
{{main|Tamil grammar}}<!--Please direct further expansion to [[Tamil grammar]]-->
Much of Tamil [[grammar]] is extensively described in the oldest available grammar book for Tamil, the ''[[Tolkāppiyam]]''. Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar ''Naṉṉūl'' which restated and clarified the rules of the Tolkāppiyam, with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely eḻuttu, col, porul, yāppu, aṇi. Of these, the last two are mostly applicable in poetry.

Tamil, like other Dravidian languages, is an [[agglutinative language]]. Tamil words consist of a [[lexeme|lexical root]] to which one or more [[affix]]es are attached.

Most Tamil affixes are [[suffix]]es. Tamil suffixes can be ''[[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] suffixes'', which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or ''[[inflection]]al suffixes'', which mark categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of [[agglutination]], which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes, which would require several words or a sentence in English.

===Parts of speech===
Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (''tiṇai'') - the "[[rational]]" (''uyartiṇai''), and the "[[irrational]]" (''aḵṟiṇai'') - which include a total of five classes (''paal'', which literally means 'gender'). [[Human]]s and [[deity|deities]] are classified as "rational", and all other nouns ([[animal]]s, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The "[[rational]]" nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes (''paal'') - masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The "[[irrational]]" nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes (''paal'') - irrational singular and irrational plural. The ''paal'' is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an [[honorific]], gender-neutral, singular form.

Suffixes are also used to perform the functions of [[case]]s or [[postposition]]s. Traditional grammars tried to group the various suffixes into 8 cases corresponding to the cases used in [[Sanskrit]]. These were the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[sociative case|sociative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[ablative case|ablative]]. Modern grammarians, however, argue that this classification is artificial, and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case. (Schiffman, 1999). Tamil nouns can also take one of four [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es, ''i'', ''a'', ''u'' and ''e'' which are functionally equivalent to demonstratives in English.

Like Tamil nouns, Tamil [[verb]]s are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of [[suffix]]es, which show person, number, mood, tense and voice.
*Person and number are indicated by [[suffix]]ing the [[oblique case]] of the relevant [[pronoun]] (''ēn'' in the above example). The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from [[grammatical particle]]s, which are added to the stem.
*Tamil has two voices. The first indicates that the subject of the sentence ''undergoes'' or ''is the object of'' the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence ''directs'' the action referred to by the verb stem.
*Tamil has three simple tenses - past, present, and future - indicated by simple suffixes, and a series of perfects, indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same [[morpheme]]s which mark tense categories.

Tamil does not distinguish between [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s - both fall under the category ''urichchol''.

Tamil has no [[article (grammar)|article]]s. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number "one" as an indefinite article, or by the context. 

In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between [[inclusive we|inclusive]] pronouns ''நாம்'' (nām) (we), ''namathu'' (our) that include the addressee and [[exclusive we|exclusive]] pronouns ''நாங்கள்'' (nāṅkaḷ)(we), ''emathu'' (our) that do not. The bifurcation of the First Person Plural pronoun (we in English) into inclusive  and exclusive  versions can also be found in [[Inclusive and exclusive we|a few more languages]].

===Syntax===
Tamil is a consistently head-final language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with typical word order [[Subject Object Verb]] (SOV). Tamil has [[postposition]]s rather than [[prepositions]]. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.

At the same time, however, Tamil also exhibits extensive ''scrambling'' (word order variation), so that all other surface permutations of the SOV order are possible - with different [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects. 

Tamil is a [[null subject language]]. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs and objects. It is possible to construct valid sentences that have only a verb - such as ''muṭintuviṭṭatu'' ("It is completed") - or only a subject and object, such as ''atu eṉ vīṭu'' ("That is my house"). Tamil does not have a [[copula]] (a linking verb equivalent to the word ''is'') and the word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning.

==Vocabulary==
:''See also: [[Wiktionary]]'s [[Wiktionary:Category:Tamil language|list of Tamil words]] and [[Wiktionary:Category:Tamil derivations|list of words of Tamil origin]]''
Modern Tamil vocabulary still retains most of the words from classical Tamil{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Due to this and because of the emphasis on learning classical works like [[Tirukkural]], classical Tamil is comprehensible in various degrees to most native speakers of today{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. However, a number of Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words have been adapted and used commonly in modern Tamil. But, unlike some other Dravidian languages, these words are restricted mainly to spiritual terminology and [[abstract noun]]s{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. 

Besides Sanskrit, there are a few loan words from Persian and Arabic implying trade ties in ancient times{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Since around the 20th century, English words have also begun to be used freely in colloquial Tamil. Some modern technical terminology is borrowed from English, though attempts are being made to have a pure Tamil technical terminology. Many individuals, and some institutions like the [[Government of Sri Lanka]], [[Tamil Virtual University]], and [[Annamalai University]] have generated technical dictionaries for Tamil. During the colonial period many [[List of loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil|loan words from Portuguese and Dutch]] were introduced into colloquial as well as written Tamil. 

There are also many instances of words of Tamil loan words in other languages. Popular [[Words of Tamil origin|examples in English]] are cheroot (''churuttu'' meaning "rolled up"), mango, mulligatawny (from ''milagu thanni'' meaning pepper water) and catamaran (from ''kattu maram'', கட்டு மரம், meaning "bundled logs").

 ''aasiriyar vakuppukkuL nuzhainthaar''.
 ''avar uLLE nuzhainthavudan maaNavarkaL ezhunthanar''.
 ''vaLavan mattum than arukil ninRu kondiruntha maaNavi kanimozhiyudan pEsik kondirunthaan''.
 ''naan avanai echarithEn.''

[[English language|English]] translation of the passage given above:
 The teacher entered the classroom.
 As soon as he entered, the students got up.
 Only Valavan was talking to Kanimozhi who was standing next to him.
 I warned him.

<small>Notes:</small>
# <small>Tamil does not have [[article (grammar)|article]]s. The [[definite article]] used above is merely an [[wikt:artefact|artefact]] of translation.</small>
# <small>To understand why Valavan would want to be warned, it is necessary to comprehend Asian social etiquette. It is considered impolite to be distracted when a person of eminence (the teacher in this case) makes an entry and the teacher may feel insulted or slighted.</small>
