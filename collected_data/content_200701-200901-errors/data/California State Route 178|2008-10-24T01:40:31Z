'''State Route 178''' (SR 178) is a route that exists in two constructed segments.  The gap in between segments is connected by various local roads and [[State Route 190 (California)|State Route 190]] through [[Death Valley National Park]].

This route is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]]<ref name="cafes">[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=250-257 CA Codes (shc:250-257)]</ref> and is eligible for the [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|State Scenic Highway System]]<ref name="scenic"> [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=260-284 CA Codes (shc:260-284)]</ref>.

==Route description==
===Western segment===
[[Image:01-2007-KernCanyon-Hwy178.jpg|thumb|left|200px|SR 178 follows the Kern River through the Kern Canyon, just northeast of Bakersfield]]
The first segment starts at [[State Route 99 (California)|State Route 99]] just west of [[Bakersfield, California|Downtown Bakersfield]]. The road continues as 24th street, but then splits at B St. utilizing 24th street as its westbound usage, and 23rd St. as its eastbound through the eastern part of [[Bakersfield, California|Downtown Bakersfield]]. 178 then becomes a freeway as it departs [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. The freeway ends about {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of Downtown and becomes a two-lane conventional highway that ascends the lower [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]] on its way to [[Lake Isabella]]. Just south of Lake Isabella, the road briefly again becomes a divided limited access freeway, but later converts back to a two lane road at the at-grade junction with Lake Isabella Blvd. The road winds a little bit until it ascends to [[Walker Pass]], an elevation of over {{convert|5000|ft|m}}. The highway then descends from the mountains to its junction with [[State Route 14 (California)|State Route 14]]. It then proceeds eastward across [[U.S. Route 395 (California)|US 395]] into the town of [[Ridgecrest, California|Ridgecrest, CA]]. The constructed highway ends at the turnoff for the [[Trona Pinnacles|Trona Pinnacles National Natural Landmark]].

===Eastern segment===
[[Image:01-2007-KernRiver-Hwy178-Sequoia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|SR 178 goes through part of [[Sequoia National Forest]].]]
The second segment resumes four miles (6 km) west of Salisberry Pass in the southeasterly part of [[Death Valley National Park]] in [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] at what had been the former boundary of Death Valley National Monument until 1994.  It then meets up with [[State Route 127 (California)|State Route 127]]. 178 then branches northward from 127 to the California-Nevada State Line.  In Nevada, the roadway continues as [[Nevada State Route 372|State Route 372]] ending at [[Nevada State Route 160|State Route 160]] near the center of [[Pahrump, Nevada|Pahrump]] in [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]].  Plans to connect the two constructed segments in California are unlikely due to the would-be link's passage through [[Death Valley National Park]].

The segment of State Route 178 from State Route 127 to the California-Nevada State Line as well as all of Nevada State Route 372 are both known as the Charles Brown Highway.  Charles Brown, a former California State Legislator, was a major proponent for the incorporation of the segment of State Route 178 between State Route 14 and the California-Nevada state line into the California Highway System.
