'''Kevin Peter Pietersen''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born [[27 June]] [[1980]] in [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], [[South Africa]]) is an English [[cricket]]er, an attacking right-handed [[batsman]] and occasional off-spin bowler who plays for [[English cricket team|England]] and [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]]. He was the fastest batsman to reach 1000 (jointly with [[Viv Richards]]) and also the fastest to 2000 runs (joint with [[Zaheer Abbas]]) in [[One-day International|one-day cricket]] ,<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/ODIS/BATTING/FASTEST_ODI_CAREER_RUNS/ODI_FASTEST_TO_1000_RUNS.html ODIs - Fastest to 1000 Career Runs], [[Cricinfo]] Records.</ref> and currently has the highest average of any England player to have played more than 20 innings of one-day cricket. The successful start to his international career has seen him rise rapidly to third in the ICC rankings of Test batsmen, behind only [[Ricky Ponting]] and [[Mohammad Yousuf]] (1st and 2nd respectively) and to first place in the One Day International batsmen rankings. 

==Early history==
Born of an [[England|English]] mother and a [[South Africa]]n father, Pietersen attended [[Maritzburg College]] in [[Pietermaritzburg]] and made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut for Natal's B team in [[1997]]/[[1998|98]]. He continued with the newly-renamed KwaZulu-Natal side for the next two South African seasons, but a lack of opportunities in his homeland, caused in part by the country's racial quota system, caused him frustration and he moved to England.<ref>[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/19296.html Cricinfo biography] </ref><ref>[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/ashes2005/story/0,15993,1519454,00.html Guardian Saturday July 2, 2005] </ref> He played cricket for [[Cannock]] CC as their overseas player, and helped them win the [[Birmingham Cricket League]] before being signed to play for [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] for the [[2001]] season. In South Africa he was regarded predominantly as an [[off-spinner]] who was capable with the bat,{{Fact|date=April 2007}} and impressed members of the England side when playing a Tour Match during England's visit in 1999/00.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} He took four top order wickets and despite batting at number nine scored 61 not out off 57 balls,{{Fact|date=April 2007}} hitting four sixes, and it is said that it was at this point that [[Nasser Hussain]] recommended to him that he secure himself a contract with a county side.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} 

In 2000 [[Clive Rice]] who had seen him play in 1997 in South Africa at a schools week heard that Pietersen was playing club cricket in Birmingham and immediately offered him a 4 year contract to play for Nottinghamshire.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  He made an immediate impression with his big hitting and athletic fielding{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  and managed an impressive [[batting average]] of 57.95 in his first year in [[county cricket]], making 1,275 runs that season; in July he made 218 not out in an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 352 with [[John Morris (cricketer)|John Morris]] at [[Derby]], having been [[lbw]] for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] in the first innings. The following year he made another unbeaten double ton, 254 not out at home to [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], in which he again took part in a huge partnership — this time 316 for the fourth wicket with [[Darren Bicknell]], and in [[2003]] he scored 764 runs in [[one-day cricket]].

Pietersen was selected for the 2003-4 ECB National Academy tour of India, and had a successful tour scoring 147 not out, 31, 114, 115, 32 and 94 in his six first-class innings to record an average of over 100 with the bat, as well as making 131 in a one-day match against India A in [[Bangalore]].

Prior to the tour of Zimbabwe, Pietersen moved from Nottinghamshire, where there were rumours of tensions with team-mates,{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  to Hampshire under the captaincy of [[Shane Warne]]. In the 2006 New Year Honours list, Pietersen, along with the rest of his England team mates, was awarded the MBE for his role in the successful 2005 Ashes series.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4625530.stm  Ashes heroes get Palace Honours], BBC Sport, Cricket, 9 February 2006.</ref>

==England career==
====2004/5====
Pietersen was selected for the full [[English cricket team|England]] one-day side to tour [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]] in [[2004]]/[[2005|05]]. He played in three of the four one day games in Zimbabwe, scoring 47, 77 and 0 in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th one dayers as England won the series 4-0. 

Pietersen was then added to the one-day squad to face [[South African cricket team|South Africa]]. With Andrew Flintoff withdrawing from the squad due to injury, Pietersen was looked at as a big-hitting replacement for the all-rounder, and claimed a place in the first team with 97 off 84 balls in the warm up match against South Africa A, in the face of a hostile crowd. 

Pietersen made a 96-ball 108 in the second ODI at [[Bloemfontein]], celebrating reaching three figures by kissing the badge on his helmet ostentatiously — and, to many of the crowd who saw him as a traitor to the country of his birth, provocatively; they deliberately turned their backs on him as he returned to the pavilion.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} He made 75 at [[Cape Town]], then at [[East London, South Africa|East London]] Pietersen made an unbeaten 100 from just 69 balls, scoring a 6 off the last ball of the innings to get it, the fastest century by an England player in a one day match, but was unable to compensate for the team's slow start, England losing by eight runs. The final game at [[Centurion Park]] was another losing cause, with Pietersen coming to the wicket at 32/3 and ending with 116 including ten 4s and six 6s. Pietersen ended the series with 454 runs in five innings, but England lost the series 4-1. By the end of the series, the South African crowds had generally replaced hostility with respect for Pietersen, applauding his performance. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

====2005====
Despite press speculation, Pietersen was not picked for the [[Test cricket|Tests]] against [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh]], with his early season form being dogged by a foot injury,<ref>[http://www.ecb.co.uk/domestic/england-star-shrugs-off-foot-injury,3706,EN.html Foot injury]</ref><ref>http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvban/content/story/209327.html Bangladesh test squad announced</ref> but with his county form picking up he was picked for the [[Twenty20]] match against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] at [[Southampton]], making 34 from 18 balls and taking three catches as England won by 100 runs.<ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/AUS_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS_ENG_TWENTY-20-I_13JUN2005.html 2005 20:20 scorecard]</ref> 

In the triangular series against Australia and Bangladesh, Pietersen did not get to bat in the first ODI at [[The Oval]] as England won by ten wickets, but scored 91 off 65 balls in the match in Bristol against Australia.<ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OD_TOURNEYS/NWS/SCORECARDS/AUS_ENG_NWS_ODI3_19JUN2005.html 2005 Natwest Series , 3rd match]</ref> Pietersen's performances at this point sparked intense press speculation and comments from former England captains calling for him to be brought into the Test side for [[The Ashes]] later in the summer.  A [[BBC]] straw poll of 10 respected cricketers resulted in a minor preference for playing Pietersen and [[Ian Bell]] in the [[Batsman (cricket)#Middle order|Middle order]], with [[Graham Thorpe]] missing out.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4110676.stm Three into two won't go]</ref> In the rest of the triangular series, Pietersen wasn't needed to bat against Bangladesh at [[Trent Bridge]], and then scored 19 off 28 balls, 23 off 26 and 6 off 10 in the matches at Riverside against Australia, Headingley against Bangladesh, in the tied final against Australia. Pietersen also played in all three matches of the NatWest Challenge against Australia, scoring 15 off 23 and 74 off 84 in the first and third matches, and not being needed to bat in the second. However, he also was forced off the field in the third over of Australia's run-chase in the third match with a groin problem.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvaus/content/story/213353.html NatWest Challenge, match 3]</ref>

Speculation over Pietersen's place in the England Test team was ended in July with the announcement by the England chairman of selectors David Graveney that Pietersen had been selected ahead of veteran [[Graham Thorpe]] for the final place in the England Test team. In the first Test of the Ashes at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]], Pietersen scored 57 in his first innings in Test cricket and 64 not out in his second as England collapsed to a heavy defeat, becoming only the 4th player to top score in both innings on debut for England,<ref name="topscore">[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/214802.html Topscorer in both innings of debut]</ref>  the eighth England player to score a half century in each innings on his debut,<ref name="topscore"/> and the third cricketer to do so at Lord's.<ref name="topscore"/> In the second Test at Edgbaston he scored 71 in the first innings and 20 in the second, with England narrowly winning by just 2 runs.<ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/AUS_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS_ENG_T2_04-08AUG2005.html 2005 Ashes, second test]</ref> In the drawn 3rd Test, Pietersen struggled with 21 and 0, then scored 45 and 23 in the fourth as England went 2-1 up.<ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/AUS_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS_ENG_T3_11-15AUG2005.html 2005 Ashes, third test]</ref><ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/AUS_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS_ENG_T4_25-29AUG2005.html 2005 Ashes, fourth test]</ref> Under pressure to post a large score in the fifth and final Test of the Ashes at [[The Oval]] on [[12 September]], Pietersen did not contribute significantly in the first innings.  In the second innings, however, with the stakes at their highest (England would regain the Ashes for the first time in 16 years if they could bat the day out) Pietersen scored his maiden Test century with 158, securing the match and the series for England. His innings included seven sixes - a record for an English player in an Ashes innings.<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/TRIVIA/BAT_MOST_SIXES_TEST.html Most sixes in a test innings]</ref> Pietersen was named [[man of the match]] for his efforts,<ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/AUS_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS_ENG_T5_08-12SEP2005.html Final Ashes Test scorecard]</ref> and finished the series with the most runs by a batsman at 473 runs over the 5 Tests, an average of 52.55.<ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/AUS_IN_ENG/STATS/AUS_IN_ENG_JUN-SEP2005_TEST_AVS.html 2005 Ashes batting statistics]</ref> However, he had a less successful series in the field, dropping six catches in the five Tests, a point he made wryly when questioned about the Australians dropping him three times on the final day.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvaus/content/story/218885.html Final Ashes Test 2005]</ref>

====2005/6====
Pietersen was awarded a [[central contract]] with the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] until the end of the 2005 [[summer]], and was named both the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] One-Day player of the year and the ICC Emerging Player of the year in 2005.  Along with the rest of the England side, Pietersen had a much less successful time in the subsequent tour of Pakistan, which England lost 2-0, although he did score his second Test century. A few months later, Pietersen toured India with the England team, scoring one fifty in each of the first two matches but not in the final match which England won. 
In March 2006, he was also fined during the Second Test in [[Mohali]], after being adjudged to have inside edged a [[Harbhajan Singh]] delivery.<ref>{{cite web|title=  2006: Penalties imposed on players for breaches of ICC Code of Conduct| url= http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/penalties/2006.html|publisher = [[International Cricket Council]]| accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref>He also passed 1,000 ODI runs during this tour with 71 in the second ODI, equalling [[Viv Richards]]' record of 21 innings to reach this landmark<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/ODIS/BATTING/FASTEST_ODI_CAREER_RUNS/ODI_FASTEST_TO_1000_RUNS.html ODIs - Fastest to 1000 Career Runs], [[Cricinfo]] Records.</ref>

====2006====
Pietersen scored 158 again, in the first Test of the summer on [[May 11|11]] & [[12 May]] 2006 against Sri Lanka, and followed it up with another 100 in the second Test including an extravagant reverse slog-sweep for six off [[Muttiah Muralitharan]]. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnShx-eALhY Video] In doing so he passed the milestone of 1,000 Test runs in his 12th Test match. In the 2nd Test he scored 142 out of England's total of 295 and became the first batsman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to score a century in 3 successive Test innings on English soil.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} This performance propelled him into the top ten of the [[ICC cricket ratings]]<ref>[http://www.cricketratings.com/ ICC Ratings], [[International Cricket Council]] [[LG ICC cricket ratings|Ratings]].</ref>
[[Image:Kevin_Pietersen_graph.png|right|thumb|350px|Kevin Pietersen's career performance graph.]]
Pietersen bowled his first delivery in Test match cricket on June 4, 2006, against Sri Lanka. He did not flight the ball, but "turned it square" according to the commentators on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s cricket programme ''[[Test Match Special]]''.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} [[Henry Blofeld]] described his bowling as showing "enormous promise" after he took his first Test wicket.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} His first Test victim came against Pakistan later in the summer when Kamran Akmal got a thin edge through to [[Geraint Jones]].

On the 1st day of the 3rd Test against Pakistan, Pietersen reached his 5th Test century with an over night score of 104. Although Pietersen retired hurt shortly after reaching three figures due to cramp, he returned to the crease on the next morning and went on to top score Englands 1st innings of 515 with 135 runs from 169 balls, including twenty 4s and two 6s.

====2006/7====
In the much anticipated return [[2006-07 Ashes]] series in Australia, Pietersen was widely judged England's best player scoring 490 runs in five matchs with an average above 50. He got off to a good start with a defiant 92 in the first test despite England losing by 277 runs, and then backed up his good form with a century in the second test in Adelaide, sharing a 310 run partnership for the 4th wicket with Paul Collingwood. When he was eventually run out, he ran back to the dressing room laughing because it was the 3rd time he had scored exactly 158 runs (his highest test score, once against Australia, then against Sri Lanka and then Australia again).{{Fact|date=April 2007}} However, even Pietersen seemed disheartened by the end of the series, which England lost 5-0.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/275400.html Pietersen the best of a poor bunch], England's Ashes Marks out of Ten, [[Cricinfo]], 6 January 2007, retrieved 12 January 2007.</ref>

In the first [[One-day International]] game of the 2006-07 [[Commonwealth Bank Series]], on 12 January 2007 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], Pietersen was injured when a ball bowled by [[Glenn McGrath]] hit him on the ribs. Despite continuing his innings in some discomfort, making 82, [[Xray]]s revealed a fracture and Pietersen was forced to miss the rest of the series.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/cbs/content/current/story/276237.html Pietersen out of tour with fractured rib], [[Cricinfo]], 12 January 2007, retrieved 12 January 2007.</ref>

====[[Cricket World Cup 2007]]====
Pietersen crafted 104 runs off 122 balls against Australia in the Super Eight stage of the tournament. It was the first instance of an Englishman scoring a World Cup century since 1996 and the first ever against Australia.[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/289672.html] He has also made 3 half centuries with a 60 run knock from 92 balls against New Zealand, 56 runs of 72 balls against Kenya and 58 runs off 80 balls against Sri Lanka. His efforts in the World Cup helped him achieve the status of [[ICC]] number one ranked batsman in the world for ODIs. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6494577.stm] However, it was not enough to help England reach the last four.  In England's last match of the World Cup against West Indies (which was Brian Lara's last international match and Duncan Fletcher's last match as England coach), Pietersen made 100 off 91 balls, and he also ran out Brian Lara.

==Personality==
[[Image:Kevin_pietersen_bowl.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Kevin Pietersen bowls [[off-spin]] in the [[Adelaide Oval]] nets]]
Pietersen is widely portrayed in the media as having a self-assured personality, described by [[Geoff Boycott]] as being "cocky and confident"{{Fact|date=April 2007}} (although his captain [[Michael Vaughan]] says, "KP is not a confident person. He obviously has great belief in his ability but that's not quite the same thing. [...] And I know KP wants to be loved. I try to text him and talk to him as often as I can because I know he is insecure.")<ref>[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/cricket/story/0,10069,1594567,00.html Psychology that guides England's man of steel], Guardian Unlimited Sport, 18 October 2005</ref> He is also noted for his unusual haircuts and, although currently sporting a shaved head of hair, his peroxide blond dyed streak of hair along the middle of his head was previously described as a "skunk" and sometimes even "dead skunk" look.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} The Australian media had given him another monicker during the [[2006-07 Ashes]] tour, "The Ego", or latterly "FIGJAM" (Fuck I'm Good, Just Ask Me) by the Australian team.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20061230/ai_n17091835- Buchanan slates Pietersen for selfish attitude]</ref>

==Partners==
In [[2005]], Pietersen was rumoured to be dating model [[Caprice Bourret]] and she later accompanied him to the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] awards in October of that year,<ref>[http://showbiz.sky.com/showbiz/article/0,,50001-1198195,00.html Who's Caprice's New Man?]</ref> but is now engaged to [[Liberty X]] singer [[Jessica Taylor (Liberty X)|Jessica Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,1861841,00.html Q&A] [[2006]]</ref> whom he is marrying in the summer with former England team-mate and Yorkshire captain Darren Gough as his best man.
