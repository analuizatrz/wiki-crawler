===Music===
{{main|List of Suzuka Music}}
The anime music including the [[background music]] and theme songs were composed by Takumi Masanori & POM. The vocals for opening and closing songs were provided by COACH☆. All except of one member of the group COACH☆ worked as a [[seiyū]] for one of the series characters. For the North American release, FUNimation had the opening and closing songs re-written and performed in English by [[Kristine Sa]]. In 2005, three Suzuka soundtrack albums were released in Japan through [[King Records|King Record. Co.,Ltd]].

The response to the soundtrack for the anime is somewhat mixed. Most find the music respectable, but some may detest it when tries to be funny. The opening and closing songs that were rewritten and performed in English made the songs fairly close approximations of the originals and worked out better than one might imagine,<ref name="ANNreview">{{cite web| last =Santos| first =Carlo| title =Suzuka DVD 1 Review| publisher =Anime News Network| date =[[2007]]-[[06-22]]| url =http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/suzuka/dvd-1| accessdate =2007-06-24 }}</ref> but others still prefer the Japanese version.<ref name="dvdt2">{{cite web | first = John| last =Sinnott | title = Suzuka v.1 | url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=28684 |publisher =DVD talk| date = [[2007]]-[[06-18]]| accessdate = 2007-07-25}} </ref>
