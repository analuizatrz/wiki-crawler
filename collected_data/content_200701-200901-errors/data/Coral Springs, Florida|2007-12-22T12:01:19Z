'''Coral Springs''', officially chartered [[July 10]], [[1963]], is a city in [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} northwest of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]. According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] estimates of 2006, the city had a population of 129,805.<ref name="censuspop">{{cite web | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau | url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=&geo_id=16000US1214400&_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US12%7C16000US1214400&_street=&_county=coral+springs&_cityTown=coral+springs&_state=04000US12&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=160&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=ACS_2005_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null%3Anull&_keyword=&_industry= | title = Coral Springs city, Florida Fact Sheet | accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> It is part of the [[South Florida metropolitan area]], which is home to 5,463,857 people.<ref name=metropop>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.xls |title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=2007-07-17 |format=XLS}}</ref> 

The city was master-planned and primarily developed by [[WCI Communities]], then known as Coral Ridge Properties. The city's name is derived from the company's name, and was selected after several earlier proposals had been considered and rejected.<ref name=TownTrivia>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/publications/TownTriviaBook2005.pdf | title=Coral Springs Town Trivia Book | publisher=City of Coral Springs | accessdate=2007-06-19 | format=PDF }}</ref> Despite the name, there are no springs in the city; Florida's springs are found in the central and northern portions of the state.<ref name=nosprings>{{cite web |url=http://fl.water.usgs.gov/PDF_files/fs151_95_spechler.pdf |title=Springs of Florida |publisher=United States Geological Survey |last1=Spechler |first1=Rick M |last2=Schiffer |first2=Donna M. |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>

During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the young city grew rapidly, adding over 35,000 residents each decade. Coral Springs has a distinctive atmosphere among South Florida cities, due in part to its stringent codes designed to maintain the city's aesthetic appeal. The city government's effective fiscal management has maintained high bond ratings, and the city has won accolades for its overall livability, its low crime rate, and its family-friendly orientation.

==History==
Coral Springs is a [[planned community]]. Prior to its incorporation as a city in July 1963, the area which is now Coral Springs was part of 20,000&nbsp;acres (80 km²) of marshy lands bought by Henry Lyons between 1911 and 1939. After several [[1947 Atlantic hurricane season|floods]] in 1947, Florida created the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District (now the South Florida Water Management District). Canals and levees drained much of the area upon which Coral Springs was built. After the land was drained and cleared, most of the area was used as a bean farm. Lyons died in 1952 and his heirs moved from beans to cattle.<ref name=History>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/history/CityHistory.pdf | title=Coral Springs History | publisher=City of Coral Springs | accessdate=2007-06-19 | format=PDF }}</ref>

A post-[[World War II]] real estate boom in South Florida attracted the interest of developers. Coral Ridge Properties, which already had several developments in Broward County, bought {{convert|3869|acre|sqkm|0}} of land from the Lyons family on December 14, 1961 for $1 million.<ref name=TownTrivia/> The City of Coral Springs was chartered on July 10, 1963. Other names that were considered for the new city included "Curran Village", "Pompano Springs" and "Quartermore". By 1964, the company had developed a master plan for a city of 50,000 residents. On [[July 22]], [[1964]] the first sale of 536 building lots netted $1.6 million. The landmark [[covered bridge]] was built that same year to promote the town. In 1965, Coral Ridge Properties bought an additional 6,000&nbsp;acres (24 km²) from the Lyons family; the total land area of Coral Springs increased to {{convert|16|sqmi|sqkm|0}}. The first city government elections were held in 1967.

The city added nineteen public schools, a regional mall, shopping centers and parks during the last three decades of the twentieth century in response to rapid population growth. The construction of the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] in 1986 brought even more growth. A museum and a theater opened in the 1990s. The city reached residential [[build-out]] in 2003<ref name=sfmc>{{cite news | author= Rochelle Broder-Singer| title=Corporate Culture | date=November 2003 | publisher=''South Florida CEO'' | url=http://www.southfloridaceo.com/archives/2003_Issues/Nov-DEC_2003/Pages/FEATURE_2.html |ccessdate = 2007-06-19}}</ref> and is very close to a commercial build-out.<ref>{{cite web | title=EDF Background and History | url=http://www.coralspringsedf.com/history.cfm | publisher=Coral Springs Economic Development Foundation | accessdate = 2007-06-19}}</ref>

The city's historically low crime rate was marred in the early 1990s, when teen gang violence made headlines, with fights and murders reported. The violence subsided and the city returned to its previously peaceful state in 1995.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB34525E8F96BFF&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Tales Of A Teen Crime Wave -- In Comfortable Coral Springs|author=Fred Grimm |date=[[24 November]] [[1991]] |page=7b |publisher=''Miami Herald''|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

The most powerful hurricane to strike Coral Springs since its incorporation was [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in 2005; the eye of the hurricane passed directly over the city. The city estimated that "as a result of the numerous hurricanes and storms that hit Coral Springs in 2004/2005, and especially as a result of Hurricane Wilma, the tree canopy coverage throughout the City has been reduced by about one third".<ref name=hurricanes>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/fullstory.cfm?articleid=10592 | title=City of Coral Springs Street Tree Subsidy Program | accessdate=2007-06-19 | publisher = City of Coral Springs}}</ref>

Built outside the City limits, the single-room wooden structure was moved to Coral Springs and became its first administration building. Later it was used as the first police station, and as a [[Jaycees]] clubhouse; it was moved to the city dump in 1976, where it was used as a fire department training site for smoke drills. After it was inadvertently set on fire, public outcry prompted the building's relocation to Mullins Park for restoration. Since 1978, it has housed the city's history museum. The exhibits in the museum are historic items and city models.<ref name=minimuseum>{{cite web|url=http://www.coralsprings.org/history/MiniMuseum.cfm|title=Museum of Coral Springs History |author=Wangberg, Wendy |publisher=City of Coral Springs |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>
