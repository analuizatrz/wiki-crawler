'''Battleships''' are very large, heavily-[[armor]]ed [[warship]]s with a main battery consisting of the largest [[caliber]] of [[gun]]s. 

The word ''battleship'' was coined around 1794 and is a shortened form of ''[[ship of the line|line-of-battle ship]]'', the dominant warship in the [[Age of Sail]].<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> The term came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a developed type of [[ironclad warship]] <ref>Stoll, J. ''Steaming in the Dark?'', Journal of Conflict Resolution Vol. 36 No. 2, Jun 1992</ref> and the common image of the battleship derives from the design of the revolutionary [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']].

More than a type of war vessel, battleships constituted a potent symbol of national might and naval domination.<ref>Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare 1815-1914'', ISBN 0-415-21478-5</ref> For decades, the numbers and abilities of battleships were a major factor in [[diplomacy]] and military [[strategy]]. The global arms race in battleship construction in the early 1900s was a significant factor in the origins of the [[First World War]], which saw a clash of huge battlefleets at the [[Battle of Jutland]]. The construction of battleships was limited by the Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s, but battleships both old and new were deployed during [[World War II]].

Despite this record, some historians and naval theorists question the value of the battleship. Aside from Jutland, there were few battleship clashes. And despite their great firepower and protection, battleships were vulnerable to much smaller, cheaper craft: initially the [[torpedo]] and [[mine]], and later the [[aircraft]] and [[guided missile]].<ref>Lenton, H. T.: ''Krigsfartyg efter 1860'', pp. 19-20</ref> The growing range of engagement led to the battleship's replacement as the leading type of warship by the [[aircraft carrier]] during World War II, being retained into the Cold War only by the United States Navy for fire support purposes. There are no battleships remaining in active service; the few that remain have been [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]].

==The ship-of-the-line==
{{main|Ship of the line}}

The ship-of-the-line was a large, unarmoured wooden sailing warship mounting a [[artillery battery|battery]] of up to 120 [[smoothbore]] and [[carronade]] [[gun]]s. The ship-of-the-line was a gradual evolution of a basic design dating as far back as the 1400s, but its basic design changed little between the adoption of [[line of battle]] tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line-of-battle-ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>

The sheer number of guns fired [[broadside]] meant that the sailing battleship could wreck any wooden vessel, smashing the hull and masts and killing the crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, and sail tactics were dependent on the wind.

The first major change to the ship-of-the-line concept was the introduction of steam power as an auxiliary propulsion system. The first military uses of steamships came in the 1810s, and in the 1820s a number of navies experimented with [[paddle steamer]] warships. Their use spread in the 1830s, with paddle-steamer warships participating in conflicts like the [[First Opium War]] alongside ships-of-the-line and frigates.<ref>Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare, 1815-1914''</ref>

Paddle steamers, however, had major disadvantages. The paddle-wheel above the waterline was exposed to enemy fire, while itself preventing the ship for firing broadside effectively. During the 1840s, the screw propellor emerged as the most likely method of steam propulsion, with both Britain and the USA launching screw-propelled warships in 1843. Through the 1840s, the British and French navies launched increasingly larger and more powerful screw ships, alongside sail-powered ships of the line. In 1845, [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]] gave an indication of the role of the new steamships in tense Anglo-French relations, describing the English Channel as a "steam bridge", rather than a barrier to French invasion. It was partly because of the fear of war with France that the Royal Navy converted several old 74-gun ships-of-the-line into 60-gun steam-powered defensive harbour batteries, called [[blockship]]s, starting in 1845.<ref>Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare, 1815-1914''</ref>
[[Image:Napoleon(1850).jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Le Napoléon (1850)|Le Napoléon]]'' (1850), the first steam battleship]]

The [[French Navy]], however, developed the first purpose-built steam battleship, with the 90-gun [[Le Napoléon (1850)|''Le Napoléon'']] in 1850.<ref>"Napoleon (90 guns), the first purpose-designed screw line of battleships", ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref> She is also considered the first true steam battleship, and the first screw battleship ever.<ref>''"Hastened to completion Le Napoleon was launched on 16 May 1850, to become the world's first true steam battleship"'', ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref> ''Napoleon'' was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots, regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement.

Eight sister-ships to ''Le Napoléon'' were built in [[France]] over a period of ten years, as the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production, in number of both purpose-built and converted units. Altogether, France built 10 new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older battleship units, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.<ref>''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p.41)</ref>

In the end, France and the United Kingdom were the only two countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships, although several other navies made some use of a mixture of screw battleships and paddle-steamer frigates. These included [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sweden]], [[Naples]], [[Prussia]], [[Denmark]] and [[Austria]].<ref>Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare, 1815-1914''</ref>

==Ironclads==
{{main|Ironclad warship}}

The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionised warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the [[ironclad warship|ironclad]]: powered by steam, protected by metal armour, and armed with guns firing high-explosive shells. The first Royal Navy ship to bear the formal designation 'battleship' was the ironclad [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']]. <ref>http://www.northwood.mod.uk/nwood/history/warrior/warrior.htm</ref>

====Explosive shells====

Wooden hull ships stood up comparatively well to solid shot, as e.g. shown in the 1866 [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|battle of Lissa]], where the old Austrian steam battleship ''Kaiser'' ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an Italian ironclad and took a pounding of several 300-pound shells at point blank range. Although losing her bowsprit and her foremast, and being set on fire, she was ready for action the very next day.<ref>Wilson, H. W.: ''Ironclads in Action - Vol 1'', London, 1898, p. 240</ref>

However, guns which fired explosive shells became more widespread following the invention of the [[Paixhans guns]] in [[1841]]. In the [[Crimean War]], the Russian Black Sea Fleet destroyed a flotilla of wooden Turkish ships at the [[Battle of Sinop]] in 1853. Later in the war French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at [[Kinburn]]. Wooden ships could not stand up to these weapons.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: ''Battleships in Transition'', pp. 92-96</ref>

====Iron armour and construction====
By the end of the 1850s, the potential of iron as a construction material for large ships had been proven by the mammoth [[SS Great Eastern]]. The development of high-explosive shells made its use as armour plate on warships necessary.

[[Image:LaGloirePhotograph.jpg|thumb|300px|The French [[French battleship La Gloire|''La Gloire'']] (1859), the first ocean-going [[ironclad]] warship]]
In [[1859]] [[France]] launched [[FS Gloire (1858-1883)|''La Gloire'']], the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She was developed as a ship of the line, but cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most of her journeys, ''La Gloire'' was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armour.

''Gloire'' prompted further innovation from the Royal Navy, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead. The superior armoured frigate [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']] followed ''La Gloire'' by only fourteen months, and both nations embarked on a programme of building new ironclads and converting existing screw ships of the line to armoured frigate status. Within two years, Italy, Austria, Spain and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships, and by the time of the famous clash of the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] at least eight navies possessed ironclad ships.<ref>Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare 1815-1914''</ref>

Usually a wooden warship had to be constructed over several years, in order to allow the timber to season properly. By the end of the 1850s, the naval rivalry between the British and French navies led to speed-up ship building programmes. This forced the shipmakers to either rebuild older ships into steam-going vessels or to use unseasoned timber to keep up with the demand. Another significant cost increasing factor was the ceasing of timber deliveries from Russia with the Crimean War. Unseasoned timber and damp from steam engines would also provide the ideal environment for rot. This and the large amounts of timber needed for the fleet programmes made the iron-hulled ships cheaper to build and maintain.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: ''Battleships in Transition'', pp. 39-40</ref>

===Evolution in Ironclad warships===
Ironclad design saw wide experimentation. Different navies experimented with the positioning of guns, in [[turrets]] (like [[USS Monitor]]), [[centre-battery|centre-batteries]] or [[barbette]]s, or with the [[ram]] as the principal weapon. 

[[Image:LeRedoutablePhoto.jpg|thumb|300px|The French [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable]] (1876), the first battleship to use steel as the main building material.]]
As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s steel was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable'']], laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 was a central [[artillery battery|battery]] and [[barbette]] warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.<ref>Conway Marine, "Steam, Steel and Shellfire" (p. 96)</ref> Russia tried [[Russian battleship Novgorod|circular battleships]], which turned out to be one of the most unusual, if not outright bad, designs ever built: when the guns were fired the ship spun on its axis like a top.<ref>Lenton, H. T.: ''Krigsfartyg efter 1860'', p. 142</ref>

Unlike the British the French often built a single example of each new design. Therefore the French navy was mocked as a "fleet of samples". Bizarre experimental warships appeared. A series of German warships was built with dozens of small guns to repel smaller crafts, a British vessel was built using a [[turbine]] engine (which ironically much later became the main propulsion system for all ships), while an entire class of French battleships such as the 1896 [[French battleship Bouvet|''Bouvet'']], known as "fierce-face" designs were developed without regard to symmetry or harmony of appearance -- favouring an aggressive look. Italy introduced a revolutionary design with the twin ships ''[[Italian ironclad Caio Duilio|Duilio]] ''and ''[[Italian battleship Dandolo|Dandolo]]'', by incorporating the biggest and newest gun available (the 450 mm Armstrong), and using an increased armour and speed.

==The Pre-Dreadnought==
{{main|Pre-Dreadnought}}
[[Image:JBMikasa.jpg|thumb|300px|Pre-''Dreadnought'' battleship [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']], flagship of the Japanese fleet at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], in 1905.]]
[[Image:HMS Agamemnon (1908) profile drawing.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of [[HMS Agamemnon (1906)|HMS Agamemnon]], a typical late pre-Dreadnought battleship]]

By the late 19th Century designs had gradually settled down what has become known as the '''pre-Dreadnought battleship'''. These were ships heavily armoured, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails.

An early design recognisably similar to the Pre-Dreadnought is the British [[Devastation class battleship|''Devastation'' class]] of 1871. However, it was not until the 1880s that similar designs were widespread.<ref>Lenton, H. T.: ''Krigsfartyg efter 1860'', p. 15</ref>

The typical first-class battleship of the Pre-Dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000 tons, had a speed of 16 [[knot (speed)|knots]], and and armament of four 12in (305mm) guns with a mixed-calibre secondary battery.<ref>Stoll, J. Steaming in the Dark?, Journal of Conflict Resolution Vol. 36 No. 2, Jun 1992</ref>  For instance, the Japanese flagship ''Mikasa'' had four guns of 12in calibre, in two centreline turrets, fore and aft, plus a secondary battery of fourteen 152&nbsp;mm (6 inch) guns along the sides, twenty 12-pounders (76&nbsp;mm or 3 inches) mostly mounted on the superstructure, and twenty smaller guns.  

The 12in main guns were the principal weapon for battleship-to-battleship combat. However, they were very slow-firing. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a 'hail of fire' from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as [[cruiser]]s. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s.<ref>War at Sea in the Ironclad Age, Richard Hill, ISBN 0-304-35273-X</ref>

Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovation of the ironclad. Turrets, armour plate, and [[steam engine]]s were all improved over the years, and [[torpedo]] tubes were introduced. 

A small number of designs, including the American [[Kearsarge class battleship|''Kearsarge'']] and [[Virginia class battleship|''Virginia'']] classes, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch (203&nbsp;mm) intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) primary, with less than stellar results. Nearly universally, recoil factors resulted in the 8-inch (203&nbsp;mm) battery being completely unusable. Additionally, the inability to separately train the primary and intermediate armament led to significant tactical limitation.

The Pre-Dreadnought era saw major nations worldwide commission battleships. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far less comfortable as France, Germany, Russia, Italy, the USA and Japan all developed their battleship fleets.<ref>Kennedy, p. 209</ref> 
 
Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Chile and Brazil all had second-rate fleets led by [[armoured cruiser]]s, [[panzership|coast service battleship]]s or [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]].<ref>Preston, Anthony: ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II''</ref>

Some navies experimented with "second-class battleships", vessels that were designed to be less expensive than full battleships but also at the cost of power; these were not effective for navies of nations with global ambitions. Though they were later called [[armored cruiser]]s the United States experimented with four such ships, including the first two American battleships, [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|''Maine'']] and [[USS Texas (1895)|''Texas'']].

==The Dreadnought era==
In 1906. the revolutionary HMS Dreadnought made existing battleships obsolete. Combining an 'all-big-gun' armament of ten 12in rifles with unprecedented speed and protection, ''Dreadnought'' prompted navies nationwide to re-evaulate their battleship building programmes. However, while the product of British technical superiority and the willpower of Admiral Jackie Fisher, ''Dreadnought'' was no bolt from the blue. The concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, and the Japanese had even laid down an all-big-gun battleship in 1904.

The arrival of the Dreadnoughts sparked an arms race, principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial symbol of national power. 

===The Origin of the Dreadnought===

====Cuniberti's idea====
[[Image:Vittoriocuniberti001.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Vittorio Cuniberti.]]
The Italian naval architect [[Vittorio Cuniberti]] first articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903, stressing a large armoured warship with a single [[caliber]] of guns as its only armament. When the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] didn't pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in [[Jane's Fighting Ships|''Jane's'']] propagating his concept, proposing the "ideal" future British battleship of 17,000&nbsp;tons, with a main battery of twelve 12&nbsp;inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns, 300 &nbsp;mm [[belt armour]], and speed of 24&nbsp;knots (44&nbsp;km/h).<ref>Cuniberti, Vittorio, "An Ideal Battleship for the British Fleet", All The World’s Fighting Ships, 1903, pp. 407-409. </ref>

====The Satsuma====
[[Image:IJN Satsuma.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']], the first ship to be designed (1904) and laid down (May 15th, 1905) as an "all-big-gun" battleship was also the largest battleship in the world at the time of her launch.]]
The battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Satsuma|Satsuma]]'' of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], became the first ship in the world to be designed (1904) and laid down (May 15th, 1905) as an all-big-gun battleship, although her armament would ultimately not be completed to specifications due to shortages of the British 12&nbsp;inch Armstrong guns. Satsuma retained triple-expansion steam engines, though her sister ship ''Aki'', completed in 1911, used turbines.

====Russo-Japanese war====
The [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-1905) provided operational experience to validate the all-big-gun concept. At the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and the [[Battle of Tsushima]], pre-Dreadnought fleets exchanged volleys of 12in shells at ranges of 7km to 11km, beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the 12in gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that the secondary batteries of the pre-Dreadnoughts were just as decisive as the larger weapons.<ref>Soundhaus, p 191, 198</ref>

====Jackie Fisher and the ''Dreadnought''====
[[Image:Jackie Fisher.jpg|thumbnail|150px|Jackie Fisher.]]
None of this was lost on the head of the British [[Admiralty]], [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]]. A far-sighted yet combative man, he saw just where the [[Royal Navy]] stood as opposed to the rest of the world's navies and took action as soon as he was promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet]]. Amidst outrage within the Royal Navy and public controversy, he sold off 90 obsolete and small ships and put a further 64 into reserve, describing all these vessels as "too weak to fight and too slow to run away", and "a miser's hoard of useless junk". This freed up crews and money to increase the number of large modern ships in home waters. He further ordered the creation of specific schools dedicated to [[engineering]], [[gun]]nery, and modern [[naval tactics]].
[[Image:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|250px|thumb|[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']].|left]]
As early as 1904, Fisher had been convinced by the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on 12in guns.<ref>Sondhaus, p 198</ref>. Fisher's concern was that submarines and destroyers would be equipped with torpedos which had a longer effective range than battleshiip guns, making speed imperative for capital ships. <ref>Sondhaus, p 199</ref>. Fisher's preferred option for the Royal Navy was his brainchild, the [[battlecruiser]]: lightly armoured but heavily armed with eight 12in guns and propelled to a remarkable speed of 25 knots by [[steam turbine]]s.

It was to prove the revolutionary technology that the battleship HMS Dreadnought was laid down in 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12in guns, had an 11in armour belt, and was the first large ship powered by [[steam turbine]]s. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three along the centreline (one forward and two aft) and two on the wings, giving her twice the [[broadside]] of anything else afloat. She retained a number of 12-pounder (3-inch) [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] cannon for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armour was strong enough that she could conceivably go head-to-head with any other ship afloat in a gun battle and win. 

''Dreadnought'' was to have been followed by three battlecruisers, their construction delayed to allow lessons from the ''Dreadnought''s construction to be used in their design. 

While Fisher may have intended ''Dreadnought'' to be the last Royal Navy battleship<ref>Sondhaus, p 200</ref>, the design was so successful that he found little support for his plan to switch over to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the design's [[wing turrets]] strained the hull when firing broadside, and the top of the thickest armour belt lay below the waterline when the ship was fully loaded), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the Bellerophon and St Vincent classes.

===The Dreadnought arms race===

In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by ''Dreadnought'', the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building: a lead of 26 over France and of 50 over Germany.<ref>''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', Paul M. Kennedy, ISBN 0-333-35094-4, p. 209</ref> In 1906, the Royal Navy now had a lead of only one: ''Dreadnought'' herself. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences.

Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts to catch up with the United Kingdom. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Austria and the USA all began dreadnought programmes; and second-rank powers including Turkey, Argentina, Brazil and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.<ref>''The First World War'', John Keegan, ISBN 0-7126-6645-1, p. 281</ref> By the beginning of World War I, over a dozen nations had commissioned Dreadnoughts. Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the USA, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, Greece, Brazil, Chile and Argentina all had Dreadnoughts in commission or under construction.

====US Navy Dreadnoughts====
The American [[South Carolina class battleship|''South Carolina'' class]] battleships were the first dreadnoughts to be completed by one of Britain's rivals. The planning for the type had begun before the ''Dreanought'' was launched, perhaps aided by secret briefing by sympathetic Royal Navy officials.<ref>Sondhaus,p 206</ref>. Construction began in 1906, after the completion of the Dreadnought, and the type had no turbines. Smaller than ''Dreadnought'' at 16,000 tons standard displacement, they carried eight 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns in four twin turrets arranged in superfiring pairs fore and aft along the centreline of the keel. This arrangement gave ''South Carolina'' and her sister ''Michigan'' a broadside equal to ''Dreadnought's'' without requiring the cumbersome [[wing turrets]] that were a feature of the first few British dreadnought classes. The superfiring arrangement had not been proven until after ''South Carolina'' went to sea, and it was initially feared that the weakness of the previous [[Virginia class battleship|''Virginia'']] class ship's stacked turrets would repeat itself. Half of the first ten U.S. dreadnoughts used the older [[reciprocating engine]]s rather than steam turbines. ''North Dakota'' and the ''Florida'' and ''Wyoming'' classes used turbines while the ''South Carolina'' class, ''Delaware'' and the ''New York'' class used vertical triple expansion (VTE) [[steam engine]]s, this was owed to the much lower fuel efficiency of the early turbines.

====The Anglo-German Arms Race====
While Fisher's reorganisation of the Navy in 1904-1905 actually cut the Naval Estimates<ref>''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', Paul M. Kennedy, ISBN 0-333-35094-4, p. 218</ref>, the pressing need for more and better ships to ensure naval superiority caused friction in the British government. The costs of maintaining the Royal Navy at a level capable of taking on the next two navies at the same time were immense.<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', pp. 11, 15</ref>

The first German response to the Dreadnought came with the [[Nassau class battleship|''Nassau'' class]], laid down in 1907, followed by the [[Helgoland class battleship|''Helgoland'' class]] in 1909. Together with two battlecruisers - a type for which the Germans had less admiration than Fisher, but which could be built under authorisation for armoured cruisers, rather than capital ships - these classes gave Germany a total of ten modern capital ships built or building in 1909. While the British ships were somewhat faster and more powerful than their German equivalents, a 12:10 ratio fell very short of the 2:1 ratio that the Royal Navy wanted to maintain.<ref>Soundhaus, p203</ref>

In 1909, the British Parliament authorised an additional four capital ships, with an additional four to be laid down in 1910 if no negotiated solution could be found. Even this compromise solution, together with a some social reforms, meant raising taxes enough to prompt a [[People's Budget|constitutional crisis]] in Britain in 1909-10. 

In 1910, the British eight-ship construction plan went ahead, including four Orion-class super-dreadnoughts, and augmented by battlecruisers purchased by Australia and New Zealand. In the same period of time, Germany laid down only three ships, giving Britain a superiority of 22 ships to 13. The British resolve demonstrated by their construction programme led the Germans to seek a negotiated end to the arms race. While the Admiralty's new target of a 60% lead over Germany was near enough to Tirpitz's goal of cutting the British lead to 50%, talks foundered on the question on whether British Commonwealth battlecruisers should be included in the count, as well as non-naval matters like the German demands for recognition of her ownership of [[Alsace-Lorraine]].<ref>Sondhaus, p204</ref>

The pace of the Dreadnought race stepped up in both nations' 1910 and 1911 budgets, with Germany laying down four capital ships each year and Britain five. The tensions came to a head following the German Naval Law of 1912. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse, the Austro-Hungarian Fleet was building 4 dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. Britain was faced with a choice of building more battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when [[social welfare]] provision was making calls on the budget. Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a huge loss of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the Mediterranean and shaking the stability of the [[British Empire]]. The only option, and the one taken by First Lord of the Admiralty [[Winston Churchill]], was to overturn a hundred years of [[splendid isolation]] and seek an alliance with [[France]].<ref>''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', Paul M. Kennedy, ISBN 0-333-35094-4, p. 224</ref> 

In spite of these important strategic consequences, the 1912 Naval Law had little bearing on the battleship force ratios. Britain responded by laying down ten new super-Dreadnoughts in her 1912 and 1913 budgets - ships of the Queen Elizabeth and Royal Sovereign classes which introduced a further step change in armament, speed and protection - while Germany laid down only five, focusing resources on the Army.<ref>Sondhaus, p204</ref>

====Japan====
With the defeat of the Russians, the Japanese navy became concerned about the potential for conflict with the USA. Japanese theorist [[Tetsuaro Sato]] developed the concept that Japan needed a fleet at a minimum 70% the size of that of the USA to compete. However, Japan's first priority was to refit the pre-Dreadnoughts it had captured from Russia, and to complete the two ''Satsuma''-class ships as pre-Dreadnoughts. It was not until 1909 that Japan laid down her first Dreadnoughts, [[Japanese battleship Kawachi|''Kawachi'']] and [[Japanese battleship Settsu|''Settsu'']], while they were not complete until 1912. Two super-Dreadnoughts of the [[Fuso class battleship|''Fuso class'']] and four Kongo-class battlecruisers were also laid down in 1912 and 1913, increasingly built from Japanese rather than imported components. While Japan adopted an 'eight-eight' Navy target - eight battleships and eight battlecruisers - it took until 1921 to hit the target, by which time the Washington Naval Treaty negated it.<ref>Sondhaus, p209</ref>

====France====
Compared to the other major naval powers France was slow to start building Dreadnoughts, instead finishing the planned ''Danton'' class of pre-Dreadnoughts, laying down five in 1907 and 1908. It was not until September 1910 that the first Dreadnoughts (of the [[Courbet class battleship|''Courbet'' class]]) were laid down, making France the eleventh nation to enter the Dreadnought race. The ''Courbet''s were  followed by three super-Dreadnoughts of the [[Bretagne class battleship|''Bretagne'' class]]; another five [[Normandie class battleship|''Normandie''-class]] ships were planned but cancelled on the outbreak of war. The Dreadnought arms race saw France drop from second to fifth in terms of naval power; however, the closer alliance with Britain made these reduced forces more than adequate for French needs. <ref>Sondhaus, p214</ref>

====Italy====
Even though Cuniberti had tried to promote the idea of an all-big-gun battleship in Italy well before the ''Dreadnought'', it took until 1909 for Italy to lay down a Dreadnought of her own. The construction of the [[Italian battleship Dante Alighieri|''Dante Alighieri'']] was prompted by ruumours of Austro-Hungarian Dreadnought building. A further five dreadnoughts of the  [[Conte di Cavour class battleship|''Cavour'']] class and [[Andrea Doria class battleship|''Andrea Doria'']] class followed as Italy sought to maintain its lead over Austro-Hungary. These ships remained the core of Italian naval strength until World War II. The subsequent ''Caracciolo''-class were cancelled on the outbreak of WWI.

====Austro-Hungary====
In January 1909, Austrian admirals circulated a document calling for a fleet of four Dreadnoughts. However, a cosntitutional crisis of 1909-10 meant that no construction could be approved. In spite of this, two Dreadnoughts were laid down by shipyards on a speculative basis, and later approved along with an additional two. The resulting ships, all of the [[Tegetthoff class battleship|''Tegetthoff'' class]], were to be accompanied by a further four ships, but these were cancelled on the outbreak of World War I.

====Russia====
In June 1909, The Russian Empire laid down four dreadnoughts of the [[Gangut class battleship|''Gangut'' class]] for the Baltic Fleet and in 1911 three more [[Imperatritsa Mariya class battleship|''Imperatritsa Mariya'' class]] dreadnoughts for the Black Sea.

====Dreadnoughts in the rest of the world====
'''Spain''' commissioned three dreadnoughts of the ''Espana'' class, laying the first down in 1909. The ''Espana''s were the lightest Dreadnoughts ever built, and had the weakest armament (of only 8 12in guns). While built in Spain, the construction was reliant on British assistance.

'''Brazil''' managed the remarkable achievement of being the third country with a Dreadnought under construction, laying down two in British shipyards in 1907. This sparked off a small-scale arms race in South America, as '''Argentina''' and then '''Chile''' commissioned Dreadnoughts. Argentina placed orders in American yards and Chile in Britain, meaning that both of Chile's two battleships were seized by the British on the outbreak of war. One of them was later returned to the Chilean government.

Many smaller navies ordered their ships from the British naval yards. At the near outbreak of WWI, the Royal Navy pressed ships under construction in British docks into their own service. This created some severe strains with the relations to the customers - among the seized vessels were some Turkish, Chilean and Canadian ships. The Ottoman Empire had two battleships near completion in Britain when the Royal Navy took over their ships. The Turks were outraged by the British move and the Germans saw an opening. Through skillful diplomacy and by handing over the battlecruiser [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']] and the cruiser [[SMS Breslau|''Breslau'']] the Germans maneuvered the Ottoman Empire into the [[Central Powers]].<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', p. 252</ref>

====The "super dreadnoughts"====
[[Image:2nd Battle Squadron.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Orion class battleship|''Orion'' class battleships]] in line.]]

Even after ''Dreadnought'''s commission, battleships continued to grow in size, guns, and technical proficiency as countries vied to have the best ships. By 1914 ''Dreadnought'' was outmoded. 

The arrival of super dreadnoughts is not as clearly identified with a single ship in the same way that the dreadnought era was initiated by HMS ''Dreadnought''. However, it is commonly held to start with the British [[Orion class battleship|''Orion'' class]], and for the German navy with the [[König class battleship|''König''s]]. What made them "super" was the unprecedented jump in displacement of 2,000 tons over the previous class, the introduction of the heavier 13.5&nbsp;inch (343&nbsp;mm) gun, and the distribution of all the main armament on the centreline of the keel. Thus, in the four years that separated the laying down of ''Dreadnought'' and [[HMS Orion (1910)|''Orion'']], displacement had increased by 25%, and weight of broadside had doubled. 

The super dreadnoughts also saw the introduction of geared turbines and [[turbo-electric]] propulsion as ways to improve the fuel efficiency of the turbines, and this robbed reciprocating machinery of its last remaining advantage. Geared turbines introduced a reduction [[gearbox]] between the turbine and the propellers (screws), this allowed the turbine to spin very, very quickly while the propellers could turn at a much more sedate and [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamically]] efficient speed. Turbo-electric propulsion took this one step further; in a turbo-electric setup, the turbines turned an [[electrical generator]], which fed electricity to [[electric motor]]s that turned the [[driveshaft]]s.

Super dreadnoughts also incorporated, during construction, the latest technical gunnery advances. Thus they received director control, designed from the outset with larger observation positions with [[rangefinder]]s and [[repeater]]s aloft, [[rangekeeper|mechanical calculators and predictors]] in protected positions below, and very advanced alignment and correction devices for the guns.

The design weakness of super dreadnoughts, which distinguished them from post-World War I designs, was armour disposition. Their design placed emphasis on vertical protection which was needed in short range battles. These ships were capable of engaging the enemy at 20,000 metres, but were vulnerable to the angle of fire that came at such ranges. Post-war designs typically had 130 to 152 mm (5 to 6 inches) of deck armour to defend against this dangerous, plunging fire. The concept of zone of immunity became a major part of the thinking behind battleship design. Lack of underwater protection was also a weakness of these pre-World War I designs which were developed only as the threat of the torpedo became real. The United States Navy's "standard"-type battleships, beginning with the [[Nevada class battleship|Nevada class]], or "Battleship 1912", were designed with long-range engagements and plunging fire in mind; the first of these ships, USS Nevada, was laid down in 1912, five years before the Battle of Jutland taught the dangers of long-range fire to European navies. Important features of the standard battleships were "all or nothing" armor and "raft" construction, a philosophy under which only the parts of the ship worth armoring with the thickest armor that could be fitted to the ship were worth armoring at all, and that enough reserve buoyancy should be contained within the resulting armored "raft" to float the entire ship in the event that the unarmored bow and stern be thoroughly riddled and flooded.

==World War I==
{{main|Naval Warfare of World War I}}
[[Image:British Grand Fleet 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[British Grand Fleet]] during [[World War I]]]]

War for the great dreadnought fleets was almost an anticlimax. There was no decisive clash of battlefleets to compare with the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The role of battleships was marginal to the great land struggle in France and Russia; and it was equally marginal to the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]], the battle between German submarines and British merchant shipping.

By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy could keep the German [[High Seas Fleet|German High Seas Fleet]] bottled up in the North Sea with relative ease. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement should result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds.<ref>''The First World War'', John Keegan, ISBN 0-7126-6645-1, p. 289</ref> The first two years of war saw conflict in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by [[battlecruiser]]s at the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]] and [[Battle of Dogger Bank]] and raids on the English coast. In the summer of 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on favourable terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the [[Battle of Jutland]]: an indecisive engagement.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 88-95</ref>

In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, Russian and Turkish battleships skirmished, but nothing more. In the Baltic, action was largely limited to convoy raiding and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons was the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] at which one Russian dreadnought was lost. The Adriatic was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: The Austro-Hungarian dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by British and French blockading fleets. And in the Mediterranean, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on [[Gallipoli]].

The course of the war also illustrated the vulnerability of battleships to cheaper weapons. In September 1914 the U-boat threat to capital ships was demonstrated by the sinking of three British armoured cruisers by a single submarine.<ref>http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/cressy.htm</ref> While Jutland was the only major clash of battleship fleets in history, the German plan for the battle relied on U-boat attacks on the British fleet; and the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers closing on British battleships, causing them to turn away to avoid the threat of torpedo attack. 

Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing paranoia in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships. By October 1916, the Royal Navy had essentially abandoned the North Sea, instructing the Grand Fleet not to go south of the [[Farne Islands]] unless adequately protected by destroyers. For the German part, the High Seas Fleet detemined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were more needed for commerce raiding, the fleet stayed in port for the remainder of the war.<ref>''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', Paul Kennedy, ISBN 0-333-35094-4, pp. 247-249</ref>   

Other theatres equally showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts. The two Austrian dreadnoughts lost in 1918 were the casualties of torpedo boats and of frogmen. The Allied capital ships lost in Gallipoli were sunk by mines, while a Turkish pre-dreadnought was caught in the Dardanelles by a British submarine.

<!--note that new battleships were virtually immune to submarine attack. it was only the old ones which were sunk.-->

==The inter-war period==

The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms-race breaking out. 

For many years, German battleships simply ceased to exist. The [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in [[Scapa Flow]], [[Scotland]]. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. However, instead most of these ships were [[Scuttling|scuttled]] by their German crews on [[21 June]] [[1919]] just before the signature of the peace treaty. Versailles also limited the German Navy, preventing Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', p. 118</ref>

While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled from years of war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the USA, Britain was keen to conclude the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, requiring Britain to accept parity with the USA and abandoning the British alliance with Japan.<ref>Kennedy p 277</ref> 

The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, e.g. the [[Geneva Naval Conference|First Geneva Naval Conference]] (1927), the [[London Naval Treaty|First London Naval Treaty]] (1930), the [[Second Geneva Naval Conference]] (1932), and finally the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] (1936), which all meant limitations for major warships. These treaties would effectively end on [[1 September]] [[1939]] with the beginning of [[World War II]], but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 124-126, 139-142</ref>

The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched from 1919-1939 than from 1905-1914. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British [[N3 battleship]], the first American [[South Dakota class battleship (1920)|South Dakota class]], and the Japanese [[Kii class battleship|Kii-class]] - all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armour - never got off the drawing board.

===Rise of the aircraft carrier===
[[Image:Ostfriesland bombed by Mitchells team p19.jpg|thumb|Right|250px|Bombing tests which sank SMS ''Ostfriesland'', September, 1921.]]

As early as 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott prophesied that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by aeroplanes.<ref>Kennedy, op. cit., p. 199</ref> By the end of World War I, aeroplanes had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon.<ref>From the ''Guinness Book of Air Facts and Feats ''(3rd edition, 1977): "The first air attack using a torpedo dropped by an aeroplane was carried out by Flight Commander Charles H. K. Edmonds, flying a Short 184 seaplane from HMS ''Ben-My-Chree'' on 12 August 1915, against a 5,000 ton (5,080 tonne) Turkish supply ship in the Sea of Marmara. Although the enemy ship was hit and sunk, the captain of a British submarine claimed to have fired a torpedo simultaneously and sunk the ship. It was further stated that the British submarine E14 had attacked and immobilised the ship four days earlier.

However, on 17 August 1915 another Turkish ship was sunk by a torpedo of whose origin there can be no doubt. On this occasion Flight Commander C. H. Edmonds, flying a Short 184, torpedoed a Turkish steamer a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flight Lieutenant G. B. Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo. The tug blew up and sank. Thereafter Dacre was able to take off and return to the ''Ben-My-Chree''</ref> A proposed attack on the German fleet at anchor in 1918 using the [[Sopwith Cuckoo]] carrier-borne torpedo-bomber was considered and rejected - but it was only so long before such a technique would be adopted.

In the 1920s, General [[Billy Mitchell]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps]], believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, presented his theory which claimed that aircraft could sink ships "under war conditions". This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a series of bombing tests on battleships. In [[1921]], he successfully sank numerous ships, including the stationary German WWI battleship, the [[USS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']] and the American [[Pre-dreadnought|pre-dreadnought battleship]] [[USS Alabama (BB-8)|''Alabama'']].

Although Mitchell had stressed "war-time conditions", the ships themselves were obsolete, had no damage control and were stationary defenseless targets. The sinking of ''Ostfriesland'' was accomplished only by violating agreed-upon rules that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions; Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rule and quickly sank the ship in a coordinated attack. This proved&mdash;at least to Mitchell&mdash;that surface fleets were obsolete. In [[1922]] he met the like-minded Italian air power theorist [[Giulio Douhet]] on a trip to Europe and soon after an excerpted translation of Douhet's ''The Command of the Air'' began to circulate in the Air Service.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', p. 126</ref> While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant in that it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot.<ref>Sondhaus, p222</ref>

===Rearmament===
[[Image:HMS Nelson (1931) profile drawing.png|thumb|300px|Diagrams of the British [[Nelson class battleship]] of the inter-war period]]
Even when the threat of war became significant again in the late 1930s, battleship construction never regained the level of importance which it had held in the years before World War I. The 'building holiday' imposed by the naval treaties meant that the building capacity of dockyards worldwide was relatively reduced, and the strategic picture had changed. The development of the [[strategic bomber]] meant that the navy was no longer the only method of projecting power overseas. The experience of the First World War indicated that destroyers and submarines would be more vital than ever for convoy protection. And the development of the [[aircraft carrier]] meant that battleships had a rival for the resources available for capital ship construction. 

In Germany, the ambitious [[Plan Z]] for naval rearmament was abandoned in favour of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of [[Bismarck class battleship]]s and battlecruisers as commerce raiders. In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defences and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the [[King George V class battleship (1939)|King George V class]]. 

It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the [[Dunkerque class battleship|Dunkerque]] and [[Richelieu class battleship|Richelieu]] classes, and the Italians two powerful [[Littorio class battleship|Littorio]]-class ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. 

The USA preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota ''Class]]. Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on the two mammoth [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato ''class battleship]]s.<ref>Lenton, H. T.: ''Krigsfartyg efter 1860'', p. 31</ref>

=== The Spanish Civil War ===
At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] the Spanish navy consisted of two small dreadnought battleships, the ''España'' and the ''Jaime I''. The  ''España'', by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of El Ferrol, fell into Nationalist hands in July 1936. The crew onboard the ''Jaime I'' mutined and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side would have one battleship, however the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers.

The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties and shore bombardments - they rarely involved themselves in direct fighting against other surface units.

In April 1937 the ''España'' ran onto a mine that had been laid by own forces and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, the ''Jaime I'' was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss.

Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On May 29, 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship [[German battleship Deutschland|''Deutschland'']] outside [[Ibiza]], causing severe damage and loss of life. The [[German battleship Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] retiliated the next day by bombarding the city of [[Almería]] causing much destruction, and the resulting [[Deutschland incident]] meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', p. 251</ref>

==World War II==

During World War II naval warfare evolved quickly. Battleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theatres. However, there were few battleship-on-battleship engagments. Battleships had little impact on the destroyer and submarine [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Battle of the Atlantic]], and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by [[aircraft carrier]]s. By the conclusion of the war it was clear that battleships were now essentially auxiliary and aircraft carriers the new principal ships of the fleet.

Each of the Axis powers used battleships in a differing context and with mixed levels of success.

===German battleships and the Battle of the Atlantic===
The two German pre-Dreadnoughts [[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|''Schleswig-Holstein'']] and [[German battleship Schlesien|''Schlesien'']] are said to have fired the first shots of WWII by commencing the bombardment of the Polish garrison at [[Westerplatte]].

However, the focus of the  battleship war in the Atlantic was driven by the attempts of German capital ship [[commerce raider]]s - two battleships, Bismarck and Tirpitz, and two battlecruisers - to influence the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Battle of the Atlantic]] by destroying [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] convoys supplying the United Kingdom. 
The superior numbers of British surface units devoted themselves to protecting the [[convoy]]s, and seeking out and trying to destroy the German ships, assisted by both naval and land-based aircraft and by sabotage attacks. 

The German raiders recorded early successes, with the [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] surprising and sinking the aircraft carrier [[HMS Glorious|''Glorious'']] off western [[Norway]] in June 1940, while the [[pocket battleship]] ''[[Admiral Graf Spee]]'' had some success in the South Atlantic by the end of 1939. 

On 24 May 1941 during an attempt to break out into the North Atlantic, the  battleship ''Bismarck'' was engaged by the British battleship ''HMS Prince of Wales'' and the battlecruiser [[HMS Hood (1918)|''Hood'']]. The Bismarck sank the Hood.

The Royal Navy hunted down ''Bismarck''; an attack by [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] [[biplane]] torpedo-bombers from the [[aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|''Ark Royal'']] disabled her steering and allowed the British heavy units to catch up; ''Bismarck'' would be sunk on [[May 27]].<ref>Zetterling, Niklas: ''Bismarck'', pp. 248-260</ref>

The loss of the ''Bismarck'' was just the beginning of the power being wielded by the aircraft against a [[capital ship]], and events would soon follow in which planners would be forced to adopt the aircraft carrier as the principal player in naval warfare.

In the [[Battle of North Cape]], on [[26 December]] [[1943]], [[HMS Duke of York (1940)|HMS ''Duke of York'']] and destroyers sank the German ''Scharnhorst'' off Norway. 

The last active German battleship, [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], had lurked until late into the war in Norwegian [[fjord]]s protected by [[anti-submarine weapon]]s and shore based anti-aircraft guns. She was severely damaged in September 1943 during [[Operation Source]], a daring covert attack by [[X class submarine|British mini-subs]], and ultimately sunk in harbour by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] heavy bombers carrying massive [[tallboy bomb]]s.<ref>Tamelander, Michael: ''Slagskeppet Tirpitz''</ref><ref>Jacobsen, Alf R.: ''Dödligt angrepp''</ref>

Late 1944, the German pocket battleships [[German pocket battleship Deutschland|KMS ''Lützow'']] and [[German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer|KMS ''Admiral Scheer'']] were supporting the retreating German army by bombarding land targets. They would also provided escort for the convoys from East Prussia, themselves carrying refugees.<ref>Linder, Jan: ''Ofredens hav'', pp. 180-184</ref><ref>Wetterholm, Claes-Göran: ''Dödens hav'', pp. 103-108</ref>

===Italian battleships in the Mediterranean===

====The attack on the Taranto naval base====
{{main|Battle of Taranto}}

Billy Mitchell's ideas would be tested for the first time in real war-like conditions. The first example of this was the British air attack on the Italian naval base at [[Taranto]] that took place on the night of [[11 November]] — [[12 November]] [[1940]] during World War II. The Royal Navy launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history, flying a small number of aircraft from an aircraft carrier in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and attacking the Italian fleet at Taranto. The effect of the British aircraft on the Italian warships led pundits around the world to predict the end of the "big gun" ship and the rise of naval air power.

===Battleships in the Pacific War===

The Pacific illustrated most clearly the increasing power of the aircraft carrier, with the Japanese inflict devastating blows to both United States Navy and Royal Navy battleships as soon as the war started. There were nevertheless a noteworthy number of battleship-to-battleship engagments in the Pacific and even towards the end of the war there were instances of battleships proving a lethal threat to carriers, rather than vice versa.

====Pearl Harbor====
{{main|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}
The Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, [[December 7]], [[1941]], managed to sink or damage most of the U.S. battleships in the Pacific region, an act that proved Mitchell's theory and showed the vulnerability of major warships lying at anchor, as at Taranto. While two battleships were sunk and the remainder heavily damaged, a major stroke of luck had occurred: the American aircraft carriers were out to sea and evaded detection. They in turn would take up the fight, eventually turning the tide of the war in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

====Sinking of HMS ''Prince of Wales''====
{{main|Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse}}
The sinking of the British battleship ''Prince of Wales'' and her escort, the battlecruiser HMS ''Repulse'' further demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack, in this case while at sea without air cover. Both ships were on their way to assist in the defense of [[Singapore]] when they were caught by Japanese land-based [[bomber]]s and [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] on [[December 10]], [[1941]]. ''Prince of Wales'' has the distinction of being the first battleship sunk by aircraft while underway and able to defend herself.<ref>Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', p. 14</ref>
[[Image:Yamatotrials.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], seen in 1941, and her sister ship [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] were the largest battleships in history.]]

====The crucial Pacific battles====
[[Image:USS Pennsylvania moving into Lingayen Gulf.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)|''Pennsylvania'']] leading battleship [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|''Colorado'']] and cruisers [[USS Louisville (CA-28)|''Louisville'']], [[USS Portland (CA-33)|''Portland'']], and [[USS Columbia (CL-56)|''Columbia'']] into [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Philippines]], January 1945.]]
At many of the crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles.  Battleships in the Pacific ended up primarily performing shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's ''Yamato'' class, which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch guns and designed as a principal strategic weapon, never realized their potential use. 

In the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Battle of Guadalcanal]] on [[November 15]] [[1942]], the United States battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']] fought and destroyed the Japanese battleship [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']].

At the [[Battle off Samar]] on [[25 October]] [[1944]] during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] proved that battleships still were a lethal weapon. The indecision of Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] and the valor of the American [[destroyer escort]] and fighter crews, who gamely put their ships and aircraft in harm's way against the much heavier battleships, saved the American [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] of "Taffy 3" from being pounded to the bottom of the ocean by gunfire of [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']] and [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] and their [[cruiser]] host. Miraculously, only [[USS Gambier Bay|''Gambier Bay'']] and four [[destroyer]]s were lost due to surface action. This was primarily due to the fact that Kurita had ordered his ships to use armor piercing rounds, believing they were attacking the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], composed of heavily-armored [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'']] and [[Ticonderoga class aircraft carrier|''Ticonderoga'']] class carriers, which simply went through the lightly armored American ships instead of exploding inside them. When they finally realized that the armor piercing rounds were not working, the Japanese fleet had already suffered heavy damage from the suicidally brave American forces. Kurita's forces were fortunate that they had not actually found the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was armed with over 1,000 combat aircraft and protected by seven battleships commanded by Rear Admiral [[Willis Lee]].

At Leyte Gulf on [[25 October]] [[1944]] six battleships, led by admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]] of the U.S. 7th Fleet sank the Japanese admiral [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s battleships [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']] and [[Japanese battleship Fusō|''Fusō'']] during the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]]. This engagement marked the last time in history when battleship faced battleship.  It was also during this battle that [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']], sistership to ''Yamato'', was sunk by aircraft attacks long before she could come within striking range of the American fleet. 
[[Image:Yamato1945.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Yamato'' under air attack, March 1945.]]

===Soviet and Finnish battleships===
During the Soviet-Finnish [[Winter War]], the Soviet battleships [[Battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)|''Marat'']] and [[Russian battleship Gangut (1909)|''Oktoberskaya Revolutsiya'']] attacked Finnish coastal batteries several times. However the damage was little on the Finnish side and the defenders bit back, claiming at least one hit on the ''Marat''.<ref>Appel, Erik: ''Finland i krig 1939-1940'', p. 182</ref> The Soviet battleships would later serve as convoy escorts during the evacuation of [[Tallinn]] and as floating batteries near Leningrad during the [[siege of Leningrad]].<ref>Linder, Jan: ''Ofredens hav'', pp. 50-51</ref> The heavy German and Finnish minefields and submarine nets would effectively restrict Soviet traffic in the Gulf of Finland, forcing the larger vessels to remain at port.<ref>Linder, Jan: ''Ofredens hav'', pp. 50-51</ref><ref>Brunila, Kai: ''Finland i krig 1940-1944'', pp. 100-108, 220-225</ref> The ''Marat'' would eventually be sunk at her moorings by the German [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]] pilot [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] on [[23 September]] [[1941]]. The wreck continued in action as a floating battery for the remainder of the siege. ''Marat'' would later be refloated and both battleships served until the 1950s.<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', pp. 201</ref>

===Fate of the French battlefleet===
{{main|Attack on Mers-el-Kébir}}
In the Mediterranean, the first objective of British battleships was to neutralise the French battlefleet after the fall of France. Had the French fleet fallen into German hands, the naval war might have been worryingly equal. The next objective was to destroy the Italian navy's battleships to enable Britain to control the Mediterranean Sea in support of the land battles in Africa and later in Italy itself.

France's fleet of three modern and four old battleships could easily have tipped the balance of the Battle of the Atlantic if they had been allowed into German hands following the Armistice between France and Germany. Britain therefore acted to neutralise this threat, seizing those French ships in British and Egyptian harbours, and opening fire on the French battleships harboured in Algiers with their own heavy guns, and later pursuing fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.


===Greek battleships===
Just prior to WWI Turkey had taken delivery of new warships. Greece felt threatened by this and started to ask around for ships to purchase. USA responded favoringly and sold the new [[USS Mississippi (BB-23)|USS ''Mississippi'']] and [[USS Idaho (BB-24)|USS ''Idaho'']] to Greece in 1914 where they were renamed [[Greek battleship Kilkis|''Kilkis'']] and [[Greek battleship Limnos|''Limnos'']] in Royal Hellenic Navy service. Greece was neutral during most of WWI and after the war the two ships were partially transferred to other duties and eventually disarmed in the late 1930s. During the German invasion of Greece during WWII, both ships were sunk by German dive bombers at the Salamis naval base in April 1941.<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', p. 250</ref>

===Fire Support===
With the German capital-ship raiders sunk or forced to remain in port, the focus of Allied battleships in the Atlantic became shore bombardment. It was while covering the Allied invasion of Morocco that the [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|''Massachusetts'']] fought [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] battleship [[French battleship Jean Bart (1940)|''Jean Bart'']] on [[27 October]],[[1942]].  A concentration of six battleships occurred as part of [[Operation Neptune]], in support of the D-Day landings in June 1944. D-Day also saw the humble sacrifice of two obsolete Dreadnoughts, which were sunk as part of the breakwater around the Allied [[Mulberry harbour]]s. 

===Response to the Air Threat===
[[Image:Kamikaze zero.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A kamikaze (just left of center near the top border), a [[A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] in this case, about to hit the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']].]]
During the later stages of the war, the air defences of the [[Allies_of_World_War_II |Allied]] battleships had been significantly improved. The battleships were now literally covered with anti-aircraft guns, and with the arrival of the [[proximity fuse]] and the [[radar]], air attacks became much more risky. To counter these defenses, the [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis Powers]] implemented different methods. The Italians used with success their tested method of having [[frogmen]] delivering explosive charges to the ships, and managed to sink the [[HMS Valiant (1914)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and the [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] in the harbor of [[Alexandria]]. Other more or less successful Italian methods included manned torpedoes and small [[MTM|motor assault boats]], which were filled with explosives, aimed at the target, sped up to full speed, while the pilot catapulted himself out from the dashing craft.<ref>Taylor, A. J. P.: ''1900-talet'', p. 139</ref>

The Germans developed a series of stand-off weapons, e.g. the [[precision-guided munition|guided bomb]] [[Fritz X]], which scored some early successes. On 9 September 1943 the Germans managed to sink the Italian battleship [[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|''Roma'']] and severely damage another battleship, the [[Italian battleship Littorio|''Italia'']], while they were underway to surrender. One week later, the Germans scored another hit with a Fritz X on the British battleship [[HMS Warspite (1913)|''Warspite'']]. The bomb penetrated six decks before exploding against the bottom of the ship, blowing a large hole in her. The ship took in a total of 5,000 tonnes of water, lost steam (and thus all power, both to the ship herself and to all her systems), and had to be taken in tow. She reached Malta but was out of action for the next 12 months.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 190-191</ref> The Japanese, on the other hand, tried to sink Allied ships through [[suicide attacks|suicide air attacks]] - the so-called [[kamikaze]]. Although many U.S. battleships took hits by kamikaze, none were seriously damaged due to their thick armor. The kamikaze were much more successful against lesser-armored ships.<ref>Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', pp. 205-213</ref>

As a result of the changing technology, plans for even larger battleships, the American [[Montana class battleship|''Montana'' class]], British [[Lion class battleship|''Lion'' Class]] and Japanese [[Super Yamato class|"Super ''Yamato''" class]], were cancelled. At the end of the war, almost all the world's battleships were decommissioned or scrapped. It is notable that most battleship losses occurred while in port. No battleship was lost to heavy bombers on the open seas, which was considered the most grave aerial peril to battleships prior to World War II due to [[Billy Mitchell]] and the [[SMS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']] experiment. The real aerial peril to battleships came from small, one to three-man [[dive bomber]]s and [[torpedo bomber]]s like the [[SBD Dauntless]] and [[TBF Avenger]]; in fact, it was the latter that sank the last battleship of the war, the ''Yamato'', as she tried to make a run for [[Okinawa]] to prevent Allied landings there in May, 1945.

==Post World War II==

[[Image:Missouri missile.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] launches a [[Tomahawk missile]].]]
After World War II, several navies retained battleships, but it became clear that they were not worth the considerable cost. During the War it had become clear that battleship-on-battleship engagements like Leyte Gulf or the sinking of the Hood were the exception and not the rule, and that engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armour of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a nuclear attack, and nuclear missiles with a range of 100km or more could be mounted on the Soviet [[Kildin class destroyer]] and [[Whiskey class submarine]] by the end of the 1950s. 
 
The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. The Italian [[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|''Giulio Cesare'']] was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed ''Novorossiysk''; it was sunk by a German mine in the [[Black Sea]] on [[29 October]] [[1955]]. The two [[Andrea Doria class battleship|''Doria'' class]] ships were scrapped in the late 1950s. The French [[French battleship Lorraine|''Lorraine'']] was scrapped in 1954, [[French battleship Richelieu|''Richelieu'']] in 1964 and [[French battleship Jean Bart|''Jean Bart'']] in 1970. The United Kingdom's four surviving [[King George V class battleship (1939)|''King George V'' class]] ships were scrapped towards the end of the 1950s, and [[HMS Vanguard (1944)|''Vanguard'']] followed around 1960. All other surviving British battleships had been scrapped in the late 1940s. The Soviet Union's ''[[Battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)|Petropavlovsk]]'' was scrapped in 1953, [[Sevastopol (disambiguation)|''Sevastopol'']] in 1957 and [[Soviet battleship Gangut|''Gangut'']] in 1959. Brazil's ''Minas Gerais'' was scrapped in 1954, and her sister ship [[Brazilian battleship Sao Paulo|''São Paulo'']] sank en route to the breakers during a storm in 1951. [[Argentina]] kept its two [[Rivadavia class battleship|''Rivadavia'' class]] ships until 1956. Chile kept ''Almirante Latorre'' (formerly HMS ''Canada'') until 1959. The Turkish battlecruiser ''Yavuz'' (formerly the German [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']], launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell it back to Germany was refused. Sweden had several small coastal defense battleships, one of which, ''[[HMS Gustav V|Gustav V]]'', survived until 1970. The Russians also scrapped four large incomplete cruisers in the late 1950s, whilst plans to build new battleships were abandoned following the death of Stalin in 1953. There were also several old ships of the line still used as housing ships or storage depots. Of these, all but HMS ''Victory'' were sunk or scrapped by 1957.

===Return of the ''Iowa'' class===
The battleships gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. Shipborne artillery support is considered by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] as more accurate, more effective and less expensive than aerial strikes. [[Radar]] and computer controlled gunfire can be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The United States recommissioned all four [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class]] battleships for the [[Korean War]] and the [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']] for the [[Vietnam War]]. These were primarily used for shore bombardment, ''New Jersey'' firing seven times more rounds against shore targets in Vietnam than she had in the Second World War.<ref>History of World Seapower, Bernard Brett, ISBN 0-603-03723-2, p. 236</ref>

As part of [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to build a [[600-ship Navy]] in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of ''[[Kirov]]'' by the Soviet Union the United States recommissioned all four ''Iowa'' class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in [[carrier battle group]]s, or led their own battle groups in a [[battleship battle group]]. These were modernized to carry [[Tomahawk missile]]s, with ''New Jersey'' seeing action bombarding [[Lebanon]], while [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']] fired their 16-inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991. ''Wisconsin'' served as the [[Tomahawk missile|TLAM]] strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of [[Operation Desert Storm]] and firing a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. This will most likely be the last combat action ever by a battleship.

All four ''Iowas'' were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service. ''Missouri'', and ''New Jersey'' are now museums at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden, N.J.]] respectively. ''Wisconsin'' is a museum (at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk, Va.]]), and was recently removed from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. However, pending donation, the public can still only tour the deck, since the rest of the ship is closed off for dehumidification. [[USS Iowa (BB-61)|''Iowa'']] (at [[Suisun Bay]]) and ''Wisconsin'' were, until recently, in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Naval Reserve Fleet]], and, if the need arises, the most likely to be re-activated.

==Today==
===Museum ships===
Battleships still in existence as museums include the American [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|USS ''Massachusetts'']], [[USS North Carolina (BB-55)|''North Carolina'']], [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|''Alabama'']], [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']], and [[USS Texas (BB-35)|''Texas'']], the British [[Mary Rose|HMS ''Mary Rose'']], [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']], the Japanese [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']], the Swedish [[Regalskeppet Vasa|''Vasa'']], the Dutch [[HNLMS Buffel|''Buffel'']] and [[HNLMS Schorpioen|''Schorpioen'']], and the Chilean [[Huáscar (ship)|''Huáscar'']]. (See [[:Category:Museum ships|Museum ships]] for other museum ships). Like museum ships, [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] is open to the public, but she is technically still in service with the Royal Navy, being the flagship of the [[Second Sea Lord]]/Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command and the oldest warship still in commission in any navy.<ref>[http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3086]</ref>

===United States Navy===
USS ''Iowa'' and USS ''Wisconsin'' had been, until fiscal year 2006, maintained in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996, which includes the following battleship readiness requirements:

# List and maintain at least two ''Iowa'' class battleships on the Naval Vessel Register that are in good condition and able to provide adequate fire support for an amphibious assault;
# Retain the existing logistical support necessary to keep at least two ''Iowa''-class battleships in active service, including technical manuals, repair and replacement parts, and ordnance; and
# Keep the two battleships on the register until the Navy certified that it has within the fleet an operational surface fire support capability that equals or exceeds the fire support capability that the ''Iowa''-class battleships would be able to provide for the Marine Corps' amphibious assaults and operations ashore. (Section 1011)<ref>[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm Information from the Federation of American Scientists website]</ref>

Plans in the United States Navy had called for keeping ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' on the register until the naval surface fire support gun and missile development programs achieve operational capability, which was expected to occur sometime between 2003 and 2008. Yet the [[littoral combat ship]]s and [[Zumwalt class destroyer]]s are still under construction, and neither will have the capability to put as much ordnance on target as the Iowas. Since ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' were removed from the Naval Vessel Register interest groups will request that they be placed on donation hold and transferred for use as museums.

The long-term plan to remove ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' and donate them as museum ships is not without controversy; the [[United States Marine Corps]] has fought to get both battleships reinstated. The USMC believes that the current naval surface fire support gun and missile programs will not be able to provide adequate fire support for an amphibious assault or onshore operations;<ref>The USMC has revised its Naval Surface Gunfire Support requirements, leaving some questions as to whether or not the [[Zumwalt class destroyer]] can meet the Marine qualifications</ref><ref>[http://www.fas.org/man/gao/gao95160.htm Information from the Federation of American Scientists Website]</ref> additionally, the USMC is claimed not to think that the Navy's [[Zumwalt class destroyer|Zumwalt class]] program will be an acceptable replacement for the battleships, and points out that these ships will not be available until 2013 in any event.<ref>[http://armedservices.house.gov/NDAA2007CommiteeReport.pdf National Defense Authorization Act of 2007, pp. 193 and 194]</ref> 

Refurbishing ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' has been priced at either $430 million for a 14-month program or $500 million for a 10-month program. These figures are however now more than ten years old, and assumes restoration of the battleships to a 1991 configuration, which includes several obsolete systems.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/htext/d0539r.html U.S. Government Accountability Office; ''Question #2 Battleship reactivation'']</ref>

==Battleships in Strategy and Doctrine==

Battleships were the embodiment of [[sea power]]. For [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. This school of thought was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship, and it called for a large fleet of the most powerful possible battleships. The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races - and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era. A related concept was the idea of a '[[fleet in being]]' - the idea that a fleet of battleships, simply by its presence, could tie down superior enemy resources and, even without a decisive battle, tip the balance of a conflict.

The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing [[nuclear weapons]] today, the ownership of battleships made a country count for something.<ref>Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare 1815-1914''</ref>

Even during the Cold War, the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS ''Missouri'' was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the Balkan region.<ref>http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm</ref> In September 1983, when [[Druze]] militia in [[Lebanon]]'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS ''New Jersey'' stopped the firing. Gunfire from ''New Jersey'' later killed militia leaders.<ref>http://www.countyhistory.com/gwf/newjersey/02/history.htm</ref>

Nevertheless, the value of battleships has always been contested. The [[Jeune Ecole]] school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s recommended light cruisers and torpedo boats rather than battleships. Subsequently, the determination of powers like Germany to build battleships has been criticised by historians who see the battleship fleets as a waste of resources which could have been better spent on submarines and commerce raiders.<ref>Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare 1815-1914''</ref>
