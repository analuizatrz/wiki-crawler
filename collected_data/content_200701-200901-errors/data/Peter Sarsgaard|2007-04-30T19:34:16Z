Sarsgaard originally wanted to become a football player, and took up ballet to help improve his coordination. After several concussions, he gave up football and became interested in writing and theatre.<ref name="Empathist3" />  It was at Washington University where he first discovered acting.  His first role was as the servant Lawrence in Molière's ''[[Tartuffe]]'', and despite the fact that he had no lines, he stole scenes with quiet displays which betrayed the title character's true intentions.  After his critical success in this role, he began to study the performing arts in earnest.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

=== Career ===
Sarsgaard's first role was in a guest spot on ''[[Law & Order]]'' in 1995. He began his film career with ''[[Dead Man Walking]]'' (1995) playing one of [[Sean Penn]]'s murder victims.<ref name="Horowitz">Horowitz, Josh (November 7, 2003), [http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/interviews/28.html BREAKING "GLASS" WITH PETER SARSGAARD], Moveiepoopshoot.com.

He also played the part of Raoul, the son of [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], in ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1998 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]''. 

However, Sarsgaard first gained critical recognition in 1999, for ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', in which he plays a violent, [[homophobic]] thug who murders [[Hilary Swank]]'s [[transgender]] character, [[Teena Brandon]].<ref name="Rainbow"/>

Attracting notice in the 2001 [[Wayne Wang]] film, ''The Center of the World'', Sarsgaard has proven himself a critical favourite in supporting roles. Other notable roles include: a Russian sailor in ''[[K-19: The Widowmaker]]'' starring [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Liam Neeson]]; the meth addict Jimmy the Finn in [[The Salton Sea]] (2002); a [[bisexual]] university researcher in ''[[Kinsey]]''; a [[bisexual]] screenwriter in ''[[The Dying Gaul]]''; the very sarcastic best friend to [[Zach Braff]]'s character in ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]''; an [[Federal Air Marshal Service|air marshal]] in ''[[Flightplan]]'' starring [[Jodie Foster]].

While making ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', in which Sarsgaard played a "gung-ho marine scout", he injured his knee and ribs.

Sarsgaard has also acted in the theater.  He is a member of [[Douglas Carter Beane]]'s [[New York City]]-based company, The Drama Department. He has appeared in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of ''Kingdom of Earth'' starring [[Cynthia Nixon]] and directed by [[John Cameron Mitchell]].  With the [[Signature Theatre Company]], he has appeared in a critically acclaimed revival of [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''[[Burn This]]'' opposite [[Elisabeth Shue]] and [[Horton Foote]]'s ''[[Laura Dennis]]''.

Sarsgaard hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on [[January 21]], [[2006]]. In his introductory monologue, he tried to point out that he was a nice guy despite his sometimes macabre roles. Video clips were then played of Sarsgaard scaring the ''SNL'' regulars, including one clip where [[Kenan Thompson]] walks into a room and finds Sarsgaard naked reading a [[newspaper]] in the dark.

=== Personal life ===
Sarsgaard has dated burlesque dancer [[Dita Von Teese]] and model/actress [[Shalom Harlow]].<ref>''The Sun'',  [http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,5-2005220696,00.html Dita has explosive sex].
