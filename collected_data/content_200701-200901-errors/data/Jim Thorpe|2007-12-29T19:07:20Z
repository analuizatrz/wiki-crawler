'''Jacobus Franciscus "Jim" Thorpe''' ([[Fox language|Sac and Fox (Sauk) from Oklahoma]]: '''Wa-Tho-Huk''') ([[May 28]] [[1888]] – [[March 28]] [[1953]]<ref name="BD">Magill. pg. 2320 <br />* Gerasimo and Whiteley. pg. 28 <br />* [http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/gilded/jb_gilded_thorpe_1.html World-Class Athlete Jim Thorpe Was Born May 28, 1888], americaslibrary.gov, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref>) was an [[United States|American]] athlete. Considered one of the most versatile athletes in modern [[sports]], he won [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals in the [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]], played [[American football]] collegiately and professionally, and also played professional [[baseball]] and [[basketball]]. He subsequently lost his Olympic titles when it was found he had played two seasons of minor league baseball before competing in the games (thus violating the [[amateurism|amateur status]] rules).  In 1978, Thorpe was given his own national holiday, which is still celebrated on May 28. 

Thorpe was of mixed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and white ancestry. He was raised as a [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]], and named Wa-Tho-Huk, roughly translated as "Bright Path". He struggled with racism throughout much of his life and his accomplishments were publicized with headlines describing him as a "Redskin" and "Indian athlete". He also played on several All-American Indian teams throughout his career and [[Barnstorm (athletics)|barnstorm]]ed as a professional basketball player with a team composed entirely of Native Americans.

Thorpe was named the greatest athlete of the first half of the twentieth century by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) in 1950, and ranked third on the AP list of athletes of the century in 1999. After his professional sports career ended, Thorpe lived in abject poverty. He worked several odd jobs, struggled with alcoholism, and lived out the last years of his life in failing health. In 1983, thirty years after his death, his medals were restored.

==Early life==
Information about Thorpe's birth, full name, and ethnic background varies widely.<ref name="County">O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 129 </ref> What is known is that he was born in [[Indian Territory]], but no [[birth certificate]] has been found. Thorpe's birth is generally considered to have taken place on [[May 28]] [[1888]]<ref name="BD"/> near the town of [[Prague, Oklahoma|Prague]], [[Oklahoma]].<ref name="NYTobit"/> '''Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe''' is the name on his christening ([[baptism]]al) certificate. 

His parents were of mixed descent. His father, Hiram Thorpe, had an [[Ireland|Irish]] father and a [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]] Indian mother, while his mother, Charlotte Vieux, had a [[France|French]] father and a Native American mother. Thorpe was raised as a Sac and Fox, and his native name was Wa-Tho-Huk, translated as "A path lighted by a great flash of lightning" or more simply "Bright Path".<ref name="County"/> As was the custom for Sac and Fox, Thorpe was named for something occurring around the time of his birth, in this case the sunlight brightening the path to the cabin where he was born. Thorpe's mother was [[Catholic]] and raised the children in the faith, which Thorpe later observed throughout his adult life.<ref> O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 131 </ref>

Together with his twin brother, Charlie, Thorpe went to school in [[Stroud, Oklahoma|Stroud]], [[Oklahoma]] at the Sac and Fox Indian Agency School. Charlie died of [[pneumonia]] when they were nine years old.<ref name="cgm">[http://www.cmgworldwide.com/sports/thorpe/fastfacts.htm Jim Thorpe – Fast facts], cgmworldwide.com, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> Charlie had helped Jim through school. Thorpe did not handle his brother's death very well and [[Runaway youth|ran away]] from school on several occasions. Hiram Thorpe then sent him to what is now known as [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Kansas]], so that he would not run away again.<ref name="Oly30"/> When his mother died of childbirth complications two years later,<ref name="Hoxie"/> Thorpe fell into a [[clinical depression|depression]]. After several arguments with his father, he ran away from home to work on a horse ranch.<ref name="Oly30">[http://www.olympics30.com/30greatest/jim-thorpe-hero.asp Jim Thorpe - Olympic Hero and Native American], olympics30.com, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> 

In 1904, Thorpe returned to his father and decided to join [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], [[Pennsylvania]], where he was coached by [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Glenn Scobey "Pop" Warner]], one of the most influential coaches in early American football history.<ref name="CNN"/> Later that year, Hiram Thorpe died from [[gangrene]] poisoning after a hunting accident.<ref name="Hoxie"> Hoxie. pg. 628 </ref> Thorpe once again dropped out of school. He resumed farm work for a few years and then returned to Carlisle, where his athletic career commenced.<ref name="Oly30"/>

==Amateur career==
===College career===
[[Image:Jim Thorpe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jim Thorpe in [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] uniform, about 1909]]
Thorpe reportedly began his athletic career at Carlisle in 1907, as he walked past the track and beat the school's [[high jump]]ers with an impromptu 5-ft 9-in jump while still wearing plain clothes. <ref name="bookrag">Encyclopedia of World Biography. [http://www.bookrags.com/Jim_Thorpe Jim Thorpe], [[Thomson-Gale]], June 2005, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. available online at bookrags.com. </ref> His earliest recorded [[track and field]] results are indeed from 1907. But track and field were certainly not the only events in which Thorpe engaged at Carlisle—he also participated in football, baseball, [[Lacrosse (sport)|lacrosse]] and even [[ballroom dancing]]. Reportedly, [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] was hesitant to allow Thorpe, his star track and field athlete, to compete in a physical game such as football.<ref name="Warner">Jeansonne. pg. 60 </ref> Thorpe however, coerced Warner into allowing him to run some plays against the school's defense; Warner assumed he would be tackled easily and give up the idea of playing football.<ref name="Warner"/> Thorpe "ran around past and through them not once, but twice."<ref name="Warner"/> He then walked over to Warner and said "[n]obody is going to tackle Jim," while flipping him the ball.<ref name="Warner"/>

He gained nationwide attention for the first time in 1911.<ref name="Redskin">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C12FC3B5E13738DDDA10A94DC405B828DF1D3 Indian Thorpe in Olympiad.; Redskin from Carlisle Will Strive for Place on American Team.], ''The New York Times'', [[April 28]], [[1912]], accessed [[April 2]], [[2007]]. </ref> As a [[running back]], [[defensive back]], [[placekicker]], and [[Punter (football position)|punter]] for his school's football team, Thorpe scored all of his team's points—four field goals and a touchdown—in an 18-15 upset of [[Harvard]].<ref name="Warner"/> His team finished the season 11–1.

The following year, he led Carlisle to the national collegiate championship, scoring 25 [[touchdown]]s and 198 points.<ref name="CNN"/> Carlisle's 1912 record included a 27-6 victory over [[United States Military Academy|Army]].<ref name="NYTobit"/> In that game, Thorpe scored a 92-yard touchdown that was nullified by a penalty incurred by a teammate; Thorpe then scored a 97-yard touchdown on the next play.<ref name="usoc">[http://www.usoc.org/26_37888.htm Jim Thorpe], usoc.org, accessed [[April 26]], [[2007]]. </ref> 

During that game, future President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] injured his knee while trying to tackle Thorpe. Eisenhower recalled of Thorpe in a 1961 speech, "Here and there, there are some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he could do anything better than any other football player I ever saw."<ref name="CNN">Botelho, Greg. [http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/07/09/jim.thorpe/ Roller-coaster life of Indian icon, sports' first star], CNN.com, [[July 14]], [[2004]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> Thorpe was given [[All-America]]n honors in both 1911 and 1912.<ref name="NYTobit"/> 

Football was—-and would remain—-Thorpe's favorite sport,<ref>O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 144 <br />* [http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=213 Jim Thorpe], profootballhalloffame.com, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> and he competed only sporadically in track and field. Nevertheless, track and field would become the sport in which Thorpe would gain the most fame.

===Olympic career===
[[Image:Jim Thorpe olympic.png|thumb|upright|Thorpe at the 1912 Summer Olympics.]]
For the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], two new multi-event disciplines were on the program, the [[pentathlon]] and the [[decathlon]]. A pentathlon based on the ancient Greek event had been organized at the [[1906 Summer Olympics]], but the 1912 edition would consist of the [[long jump]], the [[javelin throw]], 200-meter dash, the [[discus throw]] and the 1500-meter run. 

The decathlon was an entirely new event in athletics, although it had been competed in American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 St. Louis Olympics]]. However, the events of the new decathlon were slightly different from the U.S. version. Both events seemed a fit for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he alone had formed Carlisle's team in several track meets.<ref name="NYTobit"/> He could run the 100-yard dash in 10 seconds flat, the 220 in 21.8 seconds, the 440 in 51.8 seconds, the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35, the 120-yard high hurdles in 15 seconds, and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24 seconds.<ref name="NYTobit">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40A15FF3D59107A93CBAB1788D85F478585F9 Jim Thorpe Is Dead On West Coast at 64], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[March 29]], [[1953]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> He could long jump 23&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in and high-jump 6&nbsp;ft 5&nbsp;in.<ref name="NYTobit"/> He could [[pole vault]] 11&nbsp;feet, [[shot put|put the shot]] 47&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in, [[javelin throw|throw the javelin]] 163&nbsp;feet, and throw the [[discus throw|discus]] 136&nbsp;feet.<ref name="NYTobit"/> Thorpe entered the U.S. Olympic trials for both the pentathlon and the decathlon.

He easily won the awards, winning three events, and was named to the pentathlon team, which also included future [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) president [[Avery Brundage]]. There were only a few candidates for the decathlon team, and the trials were cancelled. Thorpe would contest his first—-and, as it turned out, only-—decathlon in the Olympics. Thorpe's Olympic record 8,413 points would stand for nearly two decades.<ref name="bookrag"/>

Thorpe's competition schedule for the Olympics was crowded. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he also entered the long-jump and high-jump competitions. The first event scheduled was the pentathlon. Thorpe was the class of the field, winning four events. He placed only third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the competition was primarily decided on place points, points were also calculated for the marks achieved in the events. 

The same day he won the pentathlon gold, Thorpe qualified for the high-jump final. In that final, he placed fourth and took seventh place in the long jump. Thorpe's final event was the decathlon, where tough competition from local favorite [[Hugo Wieslander]] was expected. Thorpe, however, also easily defeated Wieslander, finishing nearly 700 points ahead of him. He placed in the top four of all ten events. Overall, Thorpe won eight of the two competitions' 15 individual events.<ref name="CNN"/>

As was the custom of the day, the medals were presented to the athletes during the closing ceremonies of the games. Along with the two gold medals, Thorpe also received two challenge prizes, which were donated by King [[Gustav V of Sweden]] for the decathlon and Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] for the pentathlon. Legend has it that, when awarding Thorpe his prize, King Gustav said, "You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world," to which Thorpe replied, "Thanks, King."<ref name="Flatter">Flatter, Ron. [http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016499.html Thorpe preceded Deion, Bo], [[ESPN.com]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> (See [[Sportsperson]].)

Thorpe's successes had not gone unnoticed at home, and he was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]].<ref name="Flatter"/> He later remembered: "I heard people yelling my name, and I couldn't realize how one fellow could have so many friends."<ref name="Flatter"/>

Apart from his track and field appearance, Thorpe also played in one of two exhibition baseball matches held at the 1912 Olympics, which featured two teams made up of U.S. track and field athletes. It was not Thorpe's first try at baseball, as would soon become known to the rest of the world.

==Professional career==
===Declared a professional===
In 1913, strict rules regarding amateurism were in force for athletes participating in the Olympics. Athletes who received money prizes for competitions, who were sports teachers, or who had previously competed against professionals were not considered amateurs and were not allowed to compete in the Olympics.

In late January 1913, U.S. newspapers published stories announcing that Thorpe had played professional baseball. It is not entirely certain which newspaper first published the story; the earliest article found is from the ''[[Providence Times]]'', but the ''[[Worcester Telegram]]'' is usually mentioned as the first.<ref name="Flatter"/> Thorpe had indeed played professional baseball in the [[Eastern Carolina League]] for [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]], [[North Carolina]] in 1909 and 1910, receiving meager pay; reportedly as little as [[US Dollar|$]]2 a game and as much as $35 a week.<ref name="Anderson"/> College players, in fact, regularly spent summers playing professionally, but most, as opposed to Thorpe, used aliases.<ref name="CNN"/>

Although the public did not seem to care much about Thorpe's past,<ref name="Schaff">Schaffer and Smith. pg. 50 </ref> the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), and especially its secretary [[James E. Sullivan]], took the case very seriously.<ref> Schaffer and Smith. pg 40 </ref> Thorpe wrote a letter to Sullivan, in which he admitted playing professional baseball:<ref name="Flatter"/>

{{Cquote|...I hope I will be partly excused by the fact that I was simply an Indian schoolboy and did not know all about such things. In fact, I did not know that I was doing wrong, because I was doing what I knew several other college men had done, except that they did not use their own names....}}

His letter did not help. The AAU decided to retroactively withdraw Thorpe's amateur status and asked the IOC to do the same. Later that year, the IOC unanimously decided to strip Thorpe of his Olympic titles, medals and awards and declared him a professional. 

While Thorpe had played for money, his disqualification was not within the rules in place at the time. In the rulebook for the 1912 Olympics, it was stated that any protests had to be made within 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the games.<ref name="usoc"/> The first newspaper reports only appeared in January 1913, about six months after the Stockholm Games had concluded.<ref name="usoc"/> However, AAU and IOC officials were apparently ignorant of this rule or chose to ignore it. There is also some evidence that Thorpe's amateur status had already been questioned long before the Olympics but that this had been (deliberately) ignored by the AAU until they were confronted with it in 1913.

The only positive side to this affair for Thorpe was that, as soon as the news got out that he had been declared a professional, offers came in from professional clubs.<ref>Rogge, Johnson, and
Rendell. pg. 60 </ref>

Declared a rare free agent in the era of the reserve clause, Jim Thorpe had his pick of teams to play for.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60E11F93D5B13738DDDA80894DA405B838DF1D3 Thorpe is to Play Ball with Giants; Famous Indian Athlete Accepts McGraw's Terms Over the Telephone.], ''The New York Times'', [[February 1]], [[1913]], accessed [[April 2]], [[2007]]. </ref> He turned down a starting position with the [[Saint Louis Browns]] to be a reserve with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]. One of the immediate benefits of joining the team came that October, when the Giants joined the [[Chicago White Sox]] for a world tour.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70B1EF93E5B13738DDDAE0A94DF405B838DF1D3 Sox and Giants on World's Tour; Comiskey-McGraw Party Leaves Chicago Oct. 19 and Arrives in New York March 6.], ''The New York Times'', , accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> Barnstorming across the United States and then around the world, Thorpe was the unquestioned star of the world tour.<ref>Elfers. pg. 210 </ref> Everywhere the teams went, Thorpe brought them publicity and increased the tour's box office receipts. Among the highlights were meetings with the Pope and the last khedive of Egypt and playing before 20,000 in London with King George V in attendance. While in Rome, Thorpe was filmed wrestling with another baseball player on the floor of the Coliseum. Unfortunately, every inch of the film has been lost to time.

===Baseball, football, and basketball===
[[Image:Jim Thorpe football.png|thumb|Thorpe played football for Canton from 1915 through 1920. He also played 52 NFL games.]]

Thorpe signed with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] (baseball) in 1913 and played sporadically with them as an outfielder for three seasons. After missing the 1916 season completely, he came back to play for the Giants in 1917 but was sold to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] early in the season. In the "double [[no-hitter]]" between [[Fred Toney]] of the Reds and [[Hippo Vaughn]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]], Thorpe drove in the winning run in the 10th inning.<ref>Daley, Arthur. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A15F83D5F177B93C5A8178FD85F4D8485F9 Baseball's 'Ten Greatest Moments'], ''The New York Times'', [[April 17]], [[1949]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> Late in the season, he was sold back to the Giants. Again, he played sporadically for the Giants in 1918 and was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] on [[May 21]], [[1919]] for [[Pat Ragan]]. In his career, he amassed 91 [[runs scored]], 82 [[runs batted in]] and a .252 [[batting average]] over 289 games.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/t/thorpji01.shtml Jim Thorpe], baseball-reference.com, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> He continued to play baseball with teams in the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] until 1922.

But Thorpe had not abandoned football either. Back in 1915, Thorpe had signed with the [[Canton Bulldogs]]. They paid him $250 a game, a tremendous wage at the time.<ref name="page18">Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 18 </ref> Before Thorpe's signing, Canton was averaging 1,200 fans a game; 8,000 showed up for his debut against Massillon.<ref name="page18"/> The team won titles in 1916, 1917, and 1919. Thorpe reportedly ended the 1919 championship game by kicking a wind-assisted 95–yard punt from his team's own 5&nbsp;yard line, effectively putting the game out of reach.<ref name="page18"/> In 1920, the Bulldogs were one of fourteen teams to form the [[American Professional Football Association]] (APFA), which would become the [[National Football League]] (NFL) two years later. Thorpe was nominally the APFA's first president; however, he spent most of the year playing for Canton and a year later was replaced by [[Joseph Carr]].<ref>Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 20 </ref> He continued to play for Canton, coaching the team as well. Between 1921 and 1923, Thorpe played for the [[LaRue, Ohio|LaRue]], [[Ohio]] ([[Marion County, Ohio|Marion County]], [[Ohio]]) [[Oorang Indians]], an all-Native American team. Although the team went 3–6 in 1922,<ref>Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 34 </ref> and 1–10 in 1923,<ref>Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 40 </ref> Thorpe played well and was selected to the ''[[Green Bay Press Gazette|Green Bay Press Gazette's]]'' first All-NFL team in 1923 (the Gazette's team would later be formalized by the NFL as the league's official All-NFL team in 1931).<ref>Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 41 </ref>

Thorpe never played on an NFL championship team. He retired from pro football at the age of 41,<ref name="cgm"/> having played 52 NFL games for six teams from 1920 to 1928.

[[Image:WFI.jpg|left|thumb|World Famous Indians letterhead]]Thorpe continued to be active in sports. By 1926 he was the primary draw for the "World Famous Indians" in [[LaRue, Ohio|LaRue]], which sponsored traveling football, baseball, and basketball teams.  A ticket discovered in an old book recently brought to light his career in [[basketball]]. "Jim Thorpe and His World-Famous Indians" barnstormed for at least two years (1927–1928) in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, and [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]], [[Ohio]]. Although pictures of Thorpe in his WFI basketball uniform were printed on postcards and published in newspapers, this period of his life was not well documented, and until 2005 most of Thorpe's biographers were unaware of his basketball career.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/pdf/310_jimthorpe.pdf Jim Thorpe Ticket] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]), pbs.org, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref>

==Later life and death==  	 
In 1913, Thorpe married Iva Miller,<ref name="NYTobit"/> whom he had met at Carlisle. They had four children: Jim Jr. (who died at age 2), Gale, Charlotte and Grace.<ref name="NYTobit"/> Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic in his later years.<ref> Jeansonne. pg 61 </ref> Miller filed for divorce from Thorpe in 1925, claiming desertion.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720180,00.html List of marriages, divorces, births, and deaths], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', [[April 6]], [[1925]], available online via time.com, accessed [[May 21]], [[2007]]. </ref> 	 
 		 
In 1926 Thorpe married Freeda V. Kirkpatrick who was born on 19 September 1905 and died on 2 March 2007 in Yakima, Washington. She was working for the manager of the baseball team he was playing on at the time.<ref>{{cite news|author = [[Associated Press]]|url = http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/306603_thorpe08.html|title = Freeda Thorpe, former wife of Jim Thorpe, dies at 101], Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date = [[March 7]] [[2007]]|accessdate = [[November 23]], [[2007]]}}</ref> They had four sons: Carl, William, Richard and John.<ref name="NYTobit"/>  William, Richard and John "Jack" survived their mother who had divorced their father in 1941 after 15 years of marriage. After the end of his athletic career, Thorpe struggled to support his family. He found it difficult to work outside sports and never kept a job for an extended period of time. During the [[Great Depression]] in particular, Thorpe held various jobs, among others as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] in several movies, usually playing an Indian chief in [[Western movie]]s. Reportedly he had an uncredited cameo as an assistant sports coach in the [[Warner Brothers]] movie ''[[Jim Thorpe -- All-American]]'' (1951), starring [[Burt Lancaster]] as Thorpe. But he also worked as a construction worker, a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], a [[security guard]], and a ditch digger, and he briefly joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] in 1945.<ref>O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pgs. 144–5 </ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774347,00.html Briefs], ''TIME'', [[February 22]], [[1943]], available online via time.com, accessed [[May 21]], [[2007]]. </ref> 
 		 
By the 1950s, Thorpe had no money left, and when he was hospitalized for lip [[cancer]] in 1950, he was admitted as a charity case.<ref name="lip">Associated Press. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E1EF63A5A127B93C2A8178AD95F458585F9 Thorpe Has Cancerous Growth Removed From Lip in Hospital at Philadelphia], ''The New York Times'', [[November 10]], [[1951]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> At a press conference announcing the procedure, Thorpe's wife wept and pleaded for help, saying: "[W]e're broke.... Jim has nothing but his name and his memories. He has spent money on his own people and has given it away. He has often been exploited."<ref name="lip"/> In early 1953, Thorpe suffered his third heart attack while eating dinner with his third wife, Patricia Askew, in his trailer home in [[Lomita, California|Lomita]], [[California]]. [[Artificial respiration]] briefly revived Thorpe, and he was able to speak to those around him, but he lost consciousness shortly afterwards and died on [[March 28]] [[1953]].<ref name="NYTobit"/>

==Racism==
Thorpe's accomplishments occurred during a period of racism and racial inequality in the United States. It has been often suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity,<ref> Watterson. pg. 151<br />* Elfers. pg. 18 </ref> and although this has never been proven, public outcry at the time largely reflected this view.<ref> Schaffer and Smith. pg. 50 </ref> He also won his gold medals before Native Americans were recognized as [[citizen]]s; American Indians were granted dual citizenship in 1924, and it was not until the passing of a 1954 Civil Rights Bill, one year after Thorpe's death, that Native Americans were granted the right to vote.<ref> Lincoln and Slagle. pg. 282 </ref>

While at Carlisle in particular, Thorpe's ethnicity was openly used as a marketing tool. For many, he embodied the racial stereotype of Native Americans as fierce savage warriors.<ref name="Bloom"/> A photograph of Thorpe and the 1911 football team emphasized the purposeful racial split between the competing athletes.

==Legacy==

When Thorpe's third wife, Patricia, heard that the small Pennsylvania town of [[Mauch Chunk]] was desperately seeking to attract business, she struck a deal with the town. Mauch Chunk bought Thorpe's remains, erected a monument to him, and renamed the town in his honor (see [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]], [[Pennsylvania]]), despite the fact that Thorpe had never set foot in the city.<ref>O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 148 </ref> Thorpe's monument, featuring the quote from Gustav V, can still be found there.<ref name="Hoxie"/>

Thorpe also received great acclaim from the press. In 1950, an [[Associated Press]] poll of nearly 400 sportswriters and broadcasters voted Thorpe the greatest athlete of the first half of the 20th century.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574686/Thorpe_Jim.html Jim Thorpe] encarta.msn.com, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> In 1999, the Associated Press placed him third on their list of athletes of the century, behind [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Michael Jordan]],<ref>Associated Press. [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/ssat2.htm Top 100 athletes of the 20th century], ''[[USA Today]]'', [[December 21]], [[1999]], accessed [[March 15]], [[2007]].</ref> and [[ESPN]] ranked him seventh on their list of [[North America]]n athletes of the century.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/athletes.html Top N. American athletes of the century], espn.com, accessed [[March 15]], [[2007]]. </ref> In addition, on [[May 27]], [[1999]] the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed resolution 198 designating Thorpe as "America's athlete of the century".<ref>Landrum. pg. 17.  In 1973, Congress passed public law 93-19, a joint resolution to authorize the President to proclaim April 16, 1973, as "Jim Thorpe Day".  </ref>

Thorpe was named the "greatest American football player" of the first half of the century by the Associated Press in 1950,<ref>[http://www.cmgworldwide.com/sports/thorpe/bio3.htm Jim Thorpe Biography], cgmworldwide.com, accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> and was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1963. He is often said to be the first player inducted, although the first person inducted was [[Chicago Bears]] founder, owner, coach and player [[George Halas]]. He is memorialized in the Pro Football Hall of Fame rotunda with the larger-than-life Jim Thorpe statue as well as being a member of the college football, U.S. Olympic, and national track and field halls of fame.<ref name="CNN"/> In 1986 an award was established in his name by the Jim Thorpe Association. The [[Jim Thorpe Award]] is awarded annually to the best [[defensive back]] in [[college football]]. In 2001 Jim Thorpe was honored in a ceremony at the Jim Thorpe High School where the Wheaties company revealed the box cover for this amazing athlete.

Thorpe was memorialized in the film ''Jim Thorpe--All-American'' (1951) starring [[Burt Lancaster]] and directed by ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'s'' [[Michael Curtiz]]. Although Thorpe was listed as a consultant in the credits, he did not earn any money for the movie, as he had already sold the film rights to [[MGM]] in 1931 (for $1,500).<ref>O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 145 </ref> The movie—titled ''Man of Bronze'' when released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]—-included archival footage of the 1912 and 1932 Olympics as well as a banquet in which Thorpe was honored.  Thorpe was seen in some long shots in the film.

===Reinstated Olympic awards===

Over the years, several attempts were made to reinstate Thorpe's Olympic titles.<ref>Anderson, Dave.

They succeeded in having the AAU and [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) overturn their decisions and restore Thorpe's amateur status prior to 1913.<ref>Wethe, David and Whiteley, Michael. [http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2002/07/22/newscolumn1.html Legends lunches begin this fall with Bob Lilly], ''[[Dallas Business Journal]]'', [[July 19]], [[2002]], accessed [[April 27]], [[2007]]. </ref>

In 1982, they established the Jim Thorpe Foundation and managed to get support from the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]]. Armed with this support and evidence from 1912 showing Thorpe's disqualification had occurred outside of the 30-day limit, they finally got attention from the IOC, which had not made any attempts to reinstate Thorpe.

In October 1982, the IOC Executive Committee approved Thorpe's reinstatement.<ref name="Anderson"/> In an unusual ruling, however, they declared that Thorpe was now co-champion with Bie and Wieslander, even though both athletes had always said they considered Thorpe to be the only champion. In a ceremony on [[January 18]], [[1983]], two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, were presented with commemorative medals;<ref name="Anderson">[[Dave Anderson (sportswriter)|Anderson, Dave]].
