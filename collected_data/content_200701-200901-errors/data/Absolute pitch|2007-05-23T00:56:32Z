'''Absolute pitch''' (AP), widely referred to as '''perfect pitch''', is the ability of a person to identify or sing a [[music]]al [[note]] without the benefit of a known reference.

==Definition==

'''Absolute pitch''', or '''perfect pitch''', is "the ability to attach labels to isolated auditory stimuli on the basis of pitch alone" without external reference.<ref>{{cite book | author=Ward, W.D. and Burns, E.M. | year=1982 | title=The Psychology of Music | chapter=Absolute Pitch | editor=D. Deutsch (Ed.) | pages=431-452 | publisher=Academic Press | location=Orlando | id=ISBN 0-12-213562-8 }}</ref> Possessors of absolute pitch exhibit the ability in varying degrees. Generally, absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities:

*Identify and name individual [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] played on various instruments
*Name the [[Key signature|key]] of a given piece of tonal music
*Identify and name all the tones of a given [[Chord (music)|chord]] or other tonal mass
*Sing a given pitch without an external reference
*Name the pitches of common everyday occurrences such as car horns

Individuals may possess both absolute pitch and [[relative pitch]] ability in varying degrees.  Both relative and absolute pitch work together in actual musical listening and practice, although individuals exhibit preferred strategies in using each skill.<ref name="Miyazaki, 2004">{{cite journal | first=Ken'ichi | last=Miyazaki | year=2004 | month=June | title=How well do we understand absolute pitch? | journal=Acoustical Science and Technology | volume=25 | issue=6 | pages=270&ndash;282}}[http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf Full text]</ref>

===Distinctions===
The musicologist Richard Parncutt and the cognitive psychologist [[Daniel Levitin]] introduced the following distinctions in their entry on absolute pitch in the [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]].

===="Passive" absolute pitch====
Persons with passive absolute pitch are able to identify individual notes that they hear, and can identify the key of a composition (assuming some degree of musical knowledge). Some may be able to identify several notes played simultaneously, and therefore identify complex [[chord (music)|chord]]s. Those with passive absolute pitch are not always capable of singing a given note on command.

===="Active" absolute pitch====
Persons with active absolute pitch are able to sing any given note on cue, without prior pitch references. Active absolute pitch possessors number about 1 in 10,000 in the United States.<ref name="Sacks1995">{{cite journal | first=Oliver | last=Sacks | year=1995 | month=May | title=Musical Ability | journal=Science | volume=268 | issue=5211 | pages=621&ndash;622}}</ref> 

Not all people with active absolute pitch are [[musician]]s. However, musical training is necessary for full development of the auditory potential of a person with absolute pitch.{{Facts|date=April 2007}}

Among [[autistic]]s and [[Autistic savant|savant]]s, the incidence of absolute pitch rises considerably. Absolute pitch is common among those with [[Williams syndrome]].<ref name="Sacks1995"/>

==Scientific studies related to absolute pitch==
===Absolute pitch as a difference in cognition, not elementary sensation===
Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be measurably different from a non-absolute listener.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sergeant, D. | title=Experimental investigation of absolute pitch | journal=Journal of Research in Music Education | volume=17|year=1969|pages=135-143}}</ref>  Rather, "AP perception is not dependent on a special kind of ear; it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing."<ref>{{cite journal | author=Gregersen, P.K. | title=Instant Recognition: The Genetics of Pitch Perception | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=62|year=1998|pages=221-223}}[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v62n2/970810/970810.web.pdf Full text]</ref> Absolute pitch is an act of cognition, needing memory of the frequency, a label for the frequency (such as "B-flat"), and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label. Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing [[colour]]s, [[phoneme]]s (speech sounds) or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Even as most people have learned to recognize and name the colour ''blue'' by its frequency, it is possible that those who have had early (somewhere between the ages of 3 and 6)<ref>{{cite journal | author=Takeuchi, A.H. & Hulse, S.H | title=Absolute pitch | journal=Psychological Bulletin | volume=113|year=1993|pages=345-361}}</ref> and meaningful exposure to the names of musical tones will be likely to identify, for example, [[middle C]]. Absolute pitch, however, may be genetic, possibly an [[autosomal]] [[dominant gene]]tic trait,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Profita, J,. & Bidder, T.G | title=Perfect pitch | journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume=29 | year=1988 | pages=763-771}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Baharloo, S., Johnston, P. A., Service, S. K., Gitschier, J. & Freimer, N. B.  | title=Absolute pitch:  An approach for identification of genetic and nongenetic components | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=62 | year=1998 | pages=224-231}}[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v62n2/970244/970244.web.pdf Full text]</ref> though it "might be nothing more than a general human capacity whose expression is strongly biased by the level and type of exposure to music that people experience in a given culture."{{Facts|date=February 2007}}

===Absolute judgment influenced by music experience===
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the equal-tempered [[Musical scale|C-major scale]].  Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five "black key" tones,<ref>{{cite journal | author= Miyazaki, K | title= The speed of musical pitch identification by absolute-pitch possessors | journal= Music Perception | volume=8|year=1990|pages=177-188}}</ref> which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience.  One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Braun, M. | title= Absolute pitch in emphasized speech | journal=Acoustical Society of America: Acoustics Research Letters Online | volume=3 | year=2002 | pages=77–82}} [http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&id=ARLOFJ000003000002000077000001&idtype=cvips&prog=normal Full text] </ref>

===Absolute pitch and linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of [[tonal language]]s such as most dialects of  [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which depend heavily on pitch for [[lexicon|lexical]] meaning. "[[Tone deafness]]" is unusual among native speakers of these languages{{Facts|date=February 2007}}. Speakers of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak in a tonal language<ref>{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D., Henthorn, T., and Dolson, M. | title=Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework | journal=Music Perception | volume=21 | year=2004 | pages=339-356 }} [http://www.philomel.com/pdf/MP-2004-21_339-356.pdf Full text]</ref> (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak in a pitch stress language).  However, the brains of tonal-language speakers do not naturally process musical sound as language;<ref>{{cite journal | author=Gandour, J., Wong, D., and Hutchins, G. | title=Pitch processing in the human brain is influenced by language experience | journal=Neuroreport | volume=9 | year=1998 | pages=2115-2119 }} [http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gandour/publications/neurp_98.pdf Full text]</ref> perhaps such individuals may be more likely to acquire absolute pitch for musical tones when they later receive musical training.

It is possible that level-tone languages which are found in Africa&mdash;such as [[yoruba language|Yoruba]],<ref>{{cite journal | author=Connell, B., Ladd, D.R. | title=Aspects of pitch realization in Yoruba | journal=Phonology | volume=7 | year=1990 | pages=1-29 }}</ref> with three pitch levels, and Mambila,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Connell, B. | title=The perception of lexical tone in Mambila | journal=Language and Speech | volume=43 | year=2000 | pages=163-182}}</ref> with four&mdash;may be better suited to study the role of absolute pitch in speech than the contour-tone languages of East Asia.

Further, speakers of European languages have been found to make use of an absolute, though subconscious, pitch memory when speaking.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Braun, M. | title=Speech mirrors norm-tones: Absolute pitch as a normal but precognitive trait | journal=Acoustical Society of America: Acoustics Research Letters Online | volume=2 | year=2001 | pages=85–90}} [http://ojps.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&id=ARLOFJ000002000003000085000001&idtype=cvips Full text] </ref>

===Absolute pitch and perception===
Although absolute pitch is predicated on the ability to perceive and identify "tone chroma"<ref>{{cite journal | author=Revesz, G. | title=Über die beiden Arten des absoluten Gehörs | journal=Zeitschrift International Musikgesellschaft | volume=14 | year=1913 | pages=130-137}} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/revesz13.htm Full text][http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/revesz13e.htm Full text (English)]</ref> — where "tone chroma" is a psychological interpretation of a fundamental vibratory frequency<ref>{{cite journal | author=Korpell, H.S. | title=On the mechanism of tonal chroma in absolute pitch | journal=American Journal of Psychology | volume=78 | year=1965 | pages=298-300}}</ref> — absolute pitch is not a heightened ability to perceive and discriminate fine gradations of sound frequencies,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Oakes, W.F. | title=An experimental study of pitch naming and pitch discrimination reactions | journal=Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume=86 | year=1955 | pages=237-259}}</ref> but rather the ability to mentally categorize sounds into predefined pitch areas.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rakowski, A. | title=Categorical perception in absolute pitch | journal=Archives of Acoustics Quarterly | volume=18 | year=1993 | pages=515-523}}</ref>  An absolute listener's sense of hearing is no keener than that of a non-absolute ("normal") listener;<ref>{{cite journal | author=Fujisaki, W. and Kashino, M. | title=The basic hearing abilities of absolute pitch possessors | journal=Acoustic Science and Technology | volume=23 | year=2002 | pages=77-83}} [http://www.zainea.com/23_77.pdf Full text]</ref> furthermore, the tasks of identification (recognizing and naming a pitch) and discrimination (detecting changes or differences in rate of vibration) are accomplished with different brain mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Tervaniemi, M., Alho, K., Paavilainen, P., Sams, M., and Näätänen, R. | title=Absolute pitch and event-related brain potentials | journal=Music Perception | volume=10 | year=1993 | pages=305-316}}</ref>

===Nature or nurture?===
Many people have believed that musical ability itself is an inborn talent.<ref name="Copp, 1916">{{cite journal | author = Copp, E.F. | year=1916 | title=Musical Ability | journal=Journal of Heredity | volume=7 | pages=297&ndash;305}}[http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/copp.htm Full text]</ref> Some scientists currently believe absolute pitch may have an underlying [[genetics|genetic]] basis and are trying to locate genetic correlates;<ref name="Drayna, D. et al">{{cite journal | author = Drayna, D., Manichaikul, A., DeLange, M., Snieder, H., and Spector, T. | year=2001 | title=Genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in humans | journal=Science | volume=291 | pages=1969&ndash;1972}}</ref> most believe that the acquisition of absolute pitch requires early training during a [[critical period]] of development, regardless of whether or not a genetic predisposition toward development exists.<ref name="Chin, 2003">{{cite journal | author = Chin, C. | year=2003 | title=The development of absolute pitch | journal=Psychology of Music | volume=31 | pages=155&ndash;171}}</ref> The "unlearning theory," first proposed by Abraham,<ref name="Abraham, 1901">{{cite journal | author = Abraham, O. | year=1901 | title=Das absolute tonbewußtsein. | journal=Sammelbände der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft|volume=3|pages=1&ndash;86}} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham01.htm Full text] [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham01e.htm Full text (English)] </ref> has recently been revived by [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologists]] who argue that every person possesses absolute pitch (as a mode of perceptual processing) when they are infants, but that a shift in [[cognitive]] processing styles (from local, absolute processing to global, relational processing) causes most people to unlearn it; or, at least, causes children with musical training to discard absolute pitch as they learn to identify [[musical intervals]].<ref name="Saffran and Griepentrog, 2001">{{cite journal | author = Saffran, J. R. & Griepentrog, G. J. | year=2001 | title=Absolute pitch in infant auditory learning: Evidence for developmental reorganization | journal=Developmental Psychology | volume=37 | pages=74&ndash;85}} [http://elias.it.helsinki.fi/psyko/Opetus/HYPsykol.nsf/e9472accfeea83abc2256c4c0049705b/7a21adcc12795596c2257203003caf04/$FILE/Minna-9-Saffran01DevPsy.pdf Full text]</ref> Additionally, any nascent absolute pitch may be lost simply by the lack of reinforcement or lack of clear advantages in most activities in which the developing child is involved. An unequivocal resolution to the ongoing debate would require [[controlled experiment]]s, which are both impractical and unethical.

Researchers have been trying to teach absolute pitch ability for more than a century,<ref name="Meyer, 1899">{{cite journal | author = Meyer, M. | year=1899 | title=Is the memory of absolute pitch capable of development by training? | journal=Psychological Review | volume=6 | pages=514&ndash;516}}[http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/meyer99.htm Full text]</ref> and various commercial absolute-pitch training courses have been offered to the public since the early [[1900s]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Maryon, E. | year=1924 | title=The Science of Tone-Color | publisher=C. C. Birchard & Co. | location=Boston }} [http://www.greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_003/Marcotone.pdf Full text]</ref> It has been shown possible to learn the naming of tones later in life, although some consider this skill not to be true absolute pitch.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Levitin, D. J. & Rogers, S. E. | title=Absolute pitch: Perception, coding, and controversies | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume=9 | year=2005 | pages=26-33}} [http://www.zainea.com/absolpitch.pdf Full text]</ref> No training method for adults has yet been shown to produce abilities comparable to naturally-occurring absolute pitch.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Takeuchi, A.H. & Hulse, S.H | title=Absolute pitch | journal=Psychological Bulletin | volume=113 | year=1993 | pages=345-361}}</ref> 

For children aged 2-4, however, recent observations have shown a certain method of music education<ref name="Oura & Eguchi, 1982">{{cite journal | author = Oura, Y. & Eguchi, K. | year=1982 | title=Absolute pitch training program for children | journal=Music Education Research | volume=32  | pages=162&ndash;171}}</ref> to apparently be successful in training absolute pitch,<ref name="Sakakibara, 1999">{{cite journal | author = Sakakibara, A. | year=1999 | title=A longitudinal study of a process for acquiring absolute pitch | journal=Japanese Journal of Educational Psychology | volume=47 }}</ref> but the same method has also been shown to fail with students 5 years and older, suggesting that a developmental change in perception occurs which favors relative learning over absolute and thus supporting the theory of the "critical period" for learning absolute pitch.<ref name="Sakakibara, 2004">{{cite journal | author = Sakakibara, A. | year=2004 | title=Why are people able to acquire absolute pitch only during early childhood?:  Training age and acquisition of absolute pitch. | journal=Japanese Journal of Educational Psychology | volume=52 | pages=485&ndash;496}}</ref>

===Potential problems===
Persons who have absolute pitch may feel irritated when a piece is transposed to a different key or played at a nonstandard pitch.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Miyazaki, K. | title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context. | journal=Music Perception | volume=11 | year=1993 | pages=55-72}}</ref> They may fail to develop strong [[relative pitch]] when following standard curricula, despite the fact that maintaining absolute strategies can make simple relative tasks more difficult.  For instance, transposition of music from one key to another may prove more difficult for an individual who interprets music as a fixed sequence of absolute tones rather than relative patterns of notes.  Absolute pitch possessors have been known to find it difficult to play with an orchestra that is not tuned to [[Pitch (music)|standard concert pitch]] A4 = 440 [[hertz]] (442 Hz in some countries); this may be due to a perception of pitch which is categorical rather than freely adjustable.<ref>{{cite book | author=Harris, G.B. | year=1974 | title=Categorical perception and absolute pitch | publisher=University of Western Ontario|location=Ontario }}</ref>

==Correlation with musical talent==
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], and [[John Philip Sousa]] are some of the classical composers/musicians who had absolute pitch{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.  Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for developing a high level of talent as a musician or composer, and musicians may disagree about the overall value and relevance of absolute pitch ability to musical experience.

===Relative pitch===
Many musicians have quite good [[relative pitch]], a skill which can be learned. With practice, it is possible to listen to a single known pitch once (from a [[pitch pipe]] or a [[tuning fork]]) and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Brady, P.T. | title=Fixed-scale mechanism of absolute pitch | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=48 | year=1970 | pages=883-887}}</ref> Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently-perceived [[tonal center]].
