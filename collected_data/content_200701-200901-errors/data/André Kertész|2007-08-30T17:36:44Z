'''André Kertész''' ([[July 2]], [[1894]] – [[September 28]], [[1985]]) born '''Andor Kertész''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born, [[Jewdaism|Jewish]] photographer distinguished by his photographic [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] and by his early efforts in developing the [[photo essay]]. In the early years of his lengthy career, his then-unorthodox camera angles, which hindered [[prose]] descriptions of his works, and his unwillingness to compromise his personal photographic style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Even towards the end of his life, Kertész did not feel he had gained worldwide recognition. The first photographer to have an exposition devoted to his work, he is recognized as one of the [[seminal]] figures of [[photojournalism]], if not photography as a whole.<ref name="Of Paris & New York">{{cite book|last=Naef| first=Weston J.| coauthors=Sandra S Phillips & David Travis|title=André Kertész: Of Paris and New York |year=1985 |location= Chicago |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago| isbn=0-500-54106-X| pages=7-124}}</ref><ref name="Diary of Light">{{cite book |last=Capa |first=C.| coauthors=Hal Hinson,  Susan Harder & Hiroji Kubota |title=André Kertész: Diary of Light 1912–1985 |year=1987 |publisher=Aperture Books |location=New York |isbn=0-89381-256-0| pages=198-206}}</ref>

Dedicated by his family to work as a stock broker, Kertész was an [[autodidact]] and his early work was mostly published in magazines. This would continue until much later in his life when he ceased to accept commissions. He served briefly in [[WWI]] and began to form dreams to move to [[Paris]], which he did in 1925, against the wishes of his family. There he was involved with the artistic melting pot of immigrates and the dadaist movement, and achieved critical and commercial success. The imminent threat of [[WWII]] pushed him to immigrate again to the [[United States]], where he had a more difficult life and needed to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. He would take offense with several editors that he felt didn't recognize his work. In the 40sand 50s he stopped working for magazines and began achieved greater international success. Despite the numerous and awards he collected over the years, he still felt unrecognized, and it is unclear whether that sentiment changed before he died. His career is general divided into four periods based on where his work was most prominent at these times. They are called the Hungarian Period, the French Period, the American Period and, towards the end of his life, the International Period.

==Early life==
Born on [[July 2]], [[1894]] in [[Budapest]] to a middle-class family, Andor Kertész (known as "Bandi" by his friends) had a relatively uncomplicated childhood. He was the second eldest of three brothers and, the son of Lipót Kertész, a bookseller, and his wife, Ernesztin Hoffmann. When Lipót died in 1908 from [[tuberculosis]], Ernesztin was left widowed and without a source of income to care for her three children, Andor, Imre and Jenő. Fortunately for Andor and his mother, Ernesztin's brother Lipót Hoffmann began to provide for the family in the absence of his brother-in-law and was in many ways like a father to the three children. Soon after, Andor moved with his family to his uncle's country property in [[Szigetbecse]], where he became familiar with a laid back way of life and the beauty of nature.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/>

Lipót Hoffmann paid for Andor to go through business classes at the Academy of Commerce, and made sure he was hired at the [[stock exchange]] after completed his business studies in 1912 and received his [[baccalaureate]].<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> However, Andor is reported to have had little interest in the career, unlike his brother Imre who worked at the exchange in Budapest where he lived until he died in 1957. He was captivated instead by illustrated [[magazine]]s and activities in the countryside, such as fishing and swimming in the [[Danube]], which was a short distance from his uncle's property. After this first glimpse of photography in magazines, Andor was determined to become a photographer. He was also influenced by certain paintings by [[Lajos Tihanyi]] and Gyula Zilzer, as well as poetry.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

==Hungarian Period==
Kertész bought his first camera (an [[ICA]] box camera) in 1912, as soon as he had earned enough money,<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> despite his family's protests to continue his career in business. In his free time away from work, he began taking photographs of the local peasants, gypsies and landscape of the surrounding [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian Plains]] (the ''puszta''). His first photograph is believed to be "Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912",<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/> although his photographs weren't published until 1917, during [[World War I]], while he was a member of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army; they were first published in the magazine ''Erdekes Ujsag''.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Kertész taught himself how to use a camera and even as early as 1914 (for example, "Eugene, 1914") his distinctive and mature style was already evident.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

He was sent to the frontline by 1914, then 20, where he took photographs of life in the [[trench|trenches]] with a light-weight camera (a [[Goerz (company)|Goerz]] Tenax),<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> perfect for carrying around during combat. Unfortunately, most of these photographs were destroyed during the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungarian Revolution of 1919]]. He was wounded in 1915 by a bullet and his right arm was temporarily paralyzed. Kertész was sent to a military hospital in Budapest, but was later transferred to [[Esztergom]], where he continued to take photographs, including a [[self-portrait]] of himself for a competition in the magazine ''Borsszem Janko''.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Of this period of work, his arguably most famous piece was "Underwater Swimmer, Esztergom, 1917", the only surviving photograph of a series depicting a swimmer whose image is distorted by the water. This photograph sparked Kertész's interest in distortions that lead to his series of "Distortions" photographs during the early 1930s.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/>

Kertész remained off the frontline until peace returned to [[Europe]] in 1918, after which he reluctantly returned to the stock exchange.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> However, he did meet his future wife Erzsebet Salomon (who changed her name to Elizabeth Saly) at the exchange, where they both worked, and began to pursue her romantically. During this period of work and throughout his whole career, Elizabeth would be a model for his photographs. Continuing to devote his spare time to photography, he took numerous photographs with his brother Jenő as the subject. Still unsatisfied with his life at the stock exchange, Kertész left his career to try his hand at agricultural work and [[beekeeping]] during the early 1920s. This venture was short-lived due to the advent of political turmoil and communism in the countryside. Again returning to the stock exchange, he finally decided to leave Hungary altogether, primarily to escape his current life, but also to join one of France's photographic schools. Despite the allure of Paris, Kertész was eventually persuaded not to go by his mother for the time being. This dream of leaving Hungary would not be realised for many years to come, so in the meantime, he silently continued to work at the exchange and take photographs only in his spare time. In 1923, he was offered a silver medal by the Hungarian Amateur Photographer's Association for one of his photographs, but with the condition that he had to print the photograph in [[Bromoil Process|bromoil]]. Kertész refused and turned down the medal for a diploma from the association instead.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> He was rewarded, however, when one of his photographs was used on the cover of the Hungarian news magazine ''Erdekes Ujság'' on its [[June 26]], [[1925]] issue. The magazine had already printed one of his photographs in its [[March 25]] [[1917]] issue, but this was the first time Kertész's pictures had ever been placed on a front cover. By that time, he had already made his decision and was determined to photograph the sites in Paris and use the city's artistic elements.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

==French Period==
Kertész emigrated to [[Paris]] in September 1925 against his mother's wishes, leaving her behind along with both his brothers, his wife and his uncle Lipót, who died shortly thereafter. Jenő also left Hungary to live in [[Argentina]], but Elizabeth remained until her husband was well established in Paris and could live together. Kertész became one of the many artists who had left the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] for another country, such as François Kollar, [[Robert Capa]] and Emeric Fehér, and was certainly not the only artist emigrating to Paris; [[Man Ray]], [[Germaine Krull]] (Who also took part in exhibitions with Kertész) and [[Lucien Aigner]] all emigrated there during this period. In Paris he found critical and commercial success with magazine publications after doing commissioned work for several magazines across Europe from Germany to France to [[Italy]] to [[Great Britain]]. Kertész was the first photographer to ever have a one-man exhibition when Jan Slivinsky organised for him to have 30 of his photographs presented in 1927 at the gallery ''Sacre du Printemps Gallery''.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Over the next years, Kertész would appear in many solo exhibitions and shows with other artists.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> In one show at the Julien Levy Gallery in [[New York]] in 1932, the price of Kertész's [[Artist's proof|proofs]] was set at US$20, a large sum of money during the [[Great Depression]] of America.<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/> 

Kertész changed his first name to André soon after arriving in Paris, and would keep that name for the rest of his life. At that time, [[Dadaism]] was beginning to attract numerous photographers and was becoming a large movement amongst artists, especially in France. Kertész quickly became acquainted with the movement's members and one of them, Paul Dermée, dubbed him "Brother Seer" and "Brother Seeing Eye" during Kertész's first solo exhibition in 1927; this was an allusion to a medieval monastery where all the monks were blind bar one. Kertész continued for the entirety of his time in Paris to contact and visit various other Hungarian photographers and artists, and would eventually star in exhibitions with some of them later in his life. Indeed, he enjoyed visiting many of his sculptor friends, and was impressed by the [[Cubism]] movement. In his spare time, he created portraits of, among others, painters [[Piet Mondrian]]<ref name="Lecia">{{cite book |last=Pasi |first=Alessandro |title=Leica: Witness To A Century |year=2003 |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-05921-9| pages=54-55}}</ref> and [[Marc Chagall]], writer [[Colette]],<ref name="Diary of Light"/> and film-maker [[Sergei Eisenstein]].<ref name="Diary of Light"/> In 1928, Kertész switched from the usage of cameras with plates and moved on to a [[Leica]], which he became accustomed to quickly.<ref name="Lecia"/> This period of work was arguably one of his most productive, when he took photographs every day and had some of them published in magazines throughout the late 1920s, carefully dividing his time between commissioned work and his own personal photography.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> His photographs during this time were inspirational to other artists and photographers; [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] said of him in the early 1930s: "We all owe him a great deal".<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/> In 1930, Kertész was awarded a silver medal for services to photography at the ''Exposition Coloniale'' in Paris where he attended.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> 

Kertész was published in Fench magazines such as ''[[Vu]]'' and ''Art et Médecine'', in which he made numerous covers.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> His greatest journalistic collaboration was with the French editor and publisher of ''Vu'', [[Lucien Vogel]], who ran his photographs without explanatory prose and let him report on various subjects. Kertész enjoyed travelling in and around Paris taking photographs on the varied subject Vogel set for him to capture. Kertész was commissioned to create one of his most famous series of works, the "Distortion" photographs, in 1933: a series of about 200 photographs of two nude, female  models in various poses with their reflections in a combination of distortion mirrors, similar to those found in a carnival's [[house of mirrors]]. In some cases the models, Najinskaya Verackhatz and Nadia Kasine, were so distorted that only certain limbs or features were visible in the mirror's reflection. Some of the images appeared in the [[March 2]] issue of the so-called "girly magazine" ''Le Sourire'' and later in the [[15 September]] [[1933]] issue of ''Arts et métiers graphiques''.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/> Kertész published the book ''Distortions'' later that year containing the photographs.<ref name="Diary of Light"/>

After his first book of photographs ''Enfants'' in 1933, which was dedicated to Elizabeth and his mother, who had died earlier that year, what followed was a series of other book publications.<ref name="Diary of Light"/> His next book, ''Paris'',  was published in 1934 and dedicated to his brothers Imre and Jenő. ''Nos Amies les bêtes'' ("Our Friends the Animals") was released in 1936 and ''Les Cathédrales du vin'' ("The Catherdrals of Wine") in 1937.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/>

Unknown to his family and indeed most people, Kertész had married a French portrait photographer by the name of Rosza Klein (Although she used the name Rogi André) in the late 1920s.<ref name="Diary of Light"/> The marriage was short-lived and he never spoke about it until his dying day, so as not to upset his wife Elizabeth. In 1930, he ventured back to Hungary to visit his family. After returning to Paris, Elizabeth followed him in 1931, despite firm opposition from her family, in order to be with the love of her life. Elizabeth and André were never separated again. Despite his mother dying that same year, Kertész married Elizabeth on [[17 June]] [[1933]]. Following this, he is said to have spent increasingly less time with his artist and photographer friends to favor his new wife.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

At the time of Kertész's marriage, the [[Nazi]] party was growing in power in [[Germany]]. This prompted the magazine industries to publish stories about political topics and many stopped publishing his work due to its neutral demeanor and unpolitical subject matter. From then on, Kertész received increasingly less commissioned work and, with Elizabeth's consent, made plans to move to New York to work at the Keystone agency owned by Erney Prince. So in 1936, amidst the threat of [[World War II]] and lack of work, Kertész and Elizabeth boarded the [[SS Washington|SS ''Washington'']] bound for [[Manhattan]].<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/>

==American Period==
Kertész arrived in [[New York]] with his wife on [[15 October]] [[1936]], intent on rekindling his inspiration and finding fame as a photographer in [[United States|America]].<ref name="Diary of Light"/> He and his wife lived out of the Beaux Arts Hotel in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> From his arrival, Kertész found life in America harder than he had imagined and thus started what he would refer to later in his life as the "absolute tragedy".<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/> He was now deprived of his French artist friends and the people in America did not respond as kindly as in Paris when their picture was being taken. Soon after his arrival, Kertész approached [[Beaumont Newhall]], the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art's]] photographic department director, who was readying a show entitled ''Photography 1839–1937''.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> But when Kertész offered Newhall some of his ''Distortions'' photographs to display, Newhall criticized them, which offended Kertész, who never forgave him. Despite this, Newhall took the photographs and displayed them; Kertész went on to star in his own solo December 1937 exhibition at the PM Gallery. The final nail in the coffin for Kertész was when the Keystone agency, who had offered him offsite work which would take him to various locations for his photojournalism, instead made him spend the entirety of his work day in the company's studio.<ref name="Diary of Light"/> Kertész tried to return to France to visit, but had no money, and when he had saved enough, World War II had broken out, making travel to France nearly impossible. To make matters worse, he had little knowledge of English, a problem which had also arisen in France with French; indeed, he really knew only his native Hungarian. This had not bothered him as much in France, but in New York where he felt as though he was an outsider, it was debilitating.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

Growing more and more frustrated with the city, Kertész left Keystone to look for other work after his boss Erney Prince left the company in 1937. he was commissioned by the magazine ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' for an article on the [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] department store in their April 1937 issue. The magazine continued to work with him in further issues and Kertész took commissions from ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town and Country]]'' to supplement his income. He was invited by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' to work for the magazine, but turned the offer down, fearing he could not enthusiastically photograph a set studio series as seen in the fashion world. He instead opted to work for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, starting with a piece called ''The Tugboat''. However, despite orders, he photographed more than just the subject matter of tugboats, instead photographing the whole harbour and its going ons. Due to this, ''Life'' refused to publish the photographs and Kertész was once again frustrated with the constriction of the city and its photographic industry.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

In the [[October 25]] [[1938]] issue of ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', the magazine finally printed a series of photographs called ''A Fireman Goes to School''; but credited them to Erney Prince, Kertész's former boss.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Infuriated, Kertész considered never working with illustrated magazines ever again. He did however appear in the magazine ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'' in 1937, but was snubbed in 1939 when the magazine published a special issue containing a selection of ''Coronet's'' "Most memorable photographs", none of which were his. He later severed all ties to the magazine and its editor [[Arnold Gingrich]]. This was repeated in the June 1941 issue of ''Vogue'', which was dedicated to photography in honour of [[Condé Montrose Nast]], head of [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Publishing]]. Despite having contributed to more than 30 commissioned photo essays and articles in both ''Vogue'' and ''House and Garden'', Kertész was omitted from the list of photographers. In the same year, since he and Elizabeth carried Hungarian passports, Kertész was designated an enemy alien due to World War II and was not permitted to photograph outside or anything to do with national security,<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> and was later fingerprinted. Not wanting to be arrested or get in trouble with the police because Elizabeth had started a cosmetics company (''Cosmia Laboratories'') with a Hungarian friend, Kertész ceased to do commissioned work and disappeared from all photographic work for three years.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

Elizabeth became a US citizen on [[20 January]] [[1944]], followed on [[3 February]] by her husband.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Despite fierce competition from other photographers such as [[Irving Penn]], Kertész thrust himself back into commissioned work. Although he was left out of the 63 photographers listed in ''Vogue's'' "photographic genealogical tree", listing important photographers of the era, he was hired for Christmas commission work by ''House and Garden'', which he had worked for before. He was offered a job position teaching photography to students at the [[IIT Institute of Design|New Bauhaus - American School of Design]] in June 1944 by its director [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. Despite the honour, he turned the offer down. He also released a new photographic book, ''Day of Paris'' in 1945, comprised of photographs taken just before he left Europe. The book gained critical success. With his wife's cosmetic business booming, Kertész agreed when the new art director of ''House and Garden'' offered him a long-term, exclusive contract in 1946. Although the contract restricted his editorial abilities and forced him to spend many hours in the studio, the pay of at least US$10,000 per annum was satisfactory and all photographic negatives would be returned to him within 6 months.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/>

Although his subject range was limited, Kertész was sent to many famous homes and places, and indeed overseas, passing through [[England]] as well as Budapest and Paris once more. During that 1945 to 1962 period at ''House and Garden'', over 3,000 of his photographs were published in the magazine and he created a reputation for himself within the industry. However, Kertész made few personal pieces during this time and was starved for artistic creativity.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

==Later life and death==
In 1946, Kertész was once again placed in a solo exhibition at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which was comprised mainly of photographs from his ''Day of Paris'' series. Kertész often refers to this as one of his greatest moments in America.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Afterward however, it was not until 1962 that his photographs were in a public display again, when they were shown at [[Long Island University]]. During this dormant period spent working for ''House and Garden'' he was insulted once again when his work did not appear in [[Edward Steichen]]'s famous ''[[The Family of Man]]'' show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1955. Thus towards the end of 1961, he broke his contract to Condé Nast Publishing after a minor dispute. Kertész, now feeling liberated from the confines of the magazine, thrust himself back into the international photographic scene. This later period of his life is often referred to as the "International Period",<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/> where he was able to gain worldwide recognition and held many exhibitions in many countries. He appeared in an exhibition at the ''IV Mostra Biennale Internazionale della Fotografia'' in [[Venice]] in 1963 after his 1962 exhibition and later appeared that same year at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris. The gold medal he was awarded in Venic for his dedication to the photographic industry gave him a feeling of recognition he had never felt whilst working for ''House and Garden''. he later visited Argentina to see his brother Jenő.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/>

During this period, Kertész experimented with colour photographs, but only produced a few of them. In 1964, soon after [[John Szarkowski]] became the photography director at the Museum of Modern Art, Kertész was featured in a solo show set up by Szarkowski.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> The show, and ultimately Kertész himself, were critically acclaimed and he was soon known within photographic circles as an important photographic figure, but still not quite at the level he had been hoping for all his life; he still believed that the world did not truly appreciate him and stood by this until his death. Kertész and Elizabeth moved to a 12th floor apartment near [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]] in 1952, where he took what were to be arguably the best photographs he had taken since his arrival in America; the series depicts a snow-covered Washington Square with numerous silhouettes and tracks and was taken using a [[telephoto lens]]. Kertész appeared in numerous exhibitions throughout the world in his later life, even into his early nineties. In 1965, due to his newfound success, Kertész was appointed as a member of the [[American Society of Magazine Photographers]] and was later awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1974|1974]]. In the years to come, in addition to appearing in numerous exhibitions, Kertész also received a number of awards: in 1974 he was made a Commander of the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], in 1977 he received the Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture in New York, in 1980 the Medal of the City of Paris and the first Annual Award of the Association of International Photography Art Dealers in New York that same year. He received in 1981 an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from [[Bard College]] in New York, and again received the Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture that year. Kertész produced a number of new books during this period and also recovered some of the negatives he had left in France decades ago.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/>

[[Image:Polaroid sx70 camera.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SX-70]] camera model similar to the one Kertész experimented with in the late 1970s into the 1980s.]]
Despite his successes, Kertész still felt unrecognised as a photographer. His last years were spent travelling to various locations around the globe for his exhibitions, especially [[Japan]], and rekindling friendships with other artists. Elizabeth died in 1977 from [[cancer]] and was cremated. To cope with the loss, Kertész fell back on his new network of friends, often visiting them at night to talk. By this time, he was said to have learned basic English and often talked in what his friends called "Kertészian", a strange mixture of Hungarian, English and French.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/> In 1979, the [[Polaroid Corporation]] gifted him with one of their new [[SX-70]], which he experimented with into the 1980s. Still growing in fame, Kertész was granted the National Grand Prize of Photography in Paris in 1982, as well as the 21st Annual George Washington Award from the American Hungarian Foundation the same year. To add to the numerous award collected over his career, Kertész was later given an honorary Doctorate from the [[Royal College of Art]] in 1983; the title of Chevalier de la [[Légion d'Honneur]] in Paris in 1983, which was presented along with an apartment for future visits to Paris; the Maine Photographic Workshop's first Annual Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984; the Californian Distinguished Career in Photography Award in 1985; first Annual Master of Photography Award that same year, presented by the [[International Centre of Photography]]; as well as a honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from [[Parsons The New School for Design|Parson's School of Design]] of the New School for Social Research. To add to the overwhelming amount of appreciation shown by the various institutions across the globe, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased 100 prints from him in 1984, the largest ever acquisition of photographs from a living artist by a museum.<ref name="Diary of Light"/>

Kertész died peacefully in his sleep at home on [[28 September]] [[1985]]; he was cremated and his ashes interred with his wife's.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/> During his photographic career which had spanned for more than 70 years, Kertész had been given numerous awards for his achievements in photography. He was the first photographer ever to have a one-man show and had appeared in countless exhibitions around the world. He had travelled across the globe from Hungary and had eventually found recognition towards the end of his life and certainly after his death and is now considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism and photo essay and if not photography as a whole.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>
