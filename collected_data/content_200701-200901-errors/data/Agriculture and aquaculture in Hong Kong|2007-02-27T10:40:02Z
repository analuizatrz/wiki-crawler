{{Economy of Hong Kong}}

'''[[Agriculture]]''' is a sunset industry '''in [[Hong Kong]]'''. Most agricultural produce is directly imported from the neighbouring [[mainland China]]. Geographically Hong Kong consists largely of steep, unproductive hillside. Only 64 square kilometres of land are actively farmed. [[Farm]]s are generally small in size and they produce mainly [[leafy vegetable]]s, [[pig]]s or [[poultry]].  The policy of [[Hong Kong Government]] changed from helping to discouraging during the transition to [[tertiary industry]].  Strengthening of health and environmental rules suffocates the small business of poultry and pigs.

==Consumption==
In round figures, the daily fresh food consumption by Hong Kong’s population of more than six million is 890 tonnes of [[rice]], 1 700 tonnes of vegetables, 5 910 head of pigs, 120 head of [[cattle]] and 170 tonnes of poultry. Much of this is imported, but Hong Kong’s primary producers help to satisfy some of the demand.

==Local production==
The gross value of local agricultural production totalled $1,052 million in 2003. Five per cent of the vegetables Hong Kong people consumed, together with 31 % of the live poultry and 23 % of the live pigs, come from local farms. Local production is geared to complement rather than compete with other major market suppliers. Production efforts are aimed mainly at high-value fresh foods.

==Principal crops==

The value of crop production amounted to $272 million in 2003. [[Vegetable]] and [[flower]] production account for about 97 % of the total value, being $264 million in 2003. Vegetable crops grown all year round include white [[cabbage]], flowering cabbage, [[lettuce]], [[Chinese kale]], [[radish]], leaf [[Mustard plant|mustard]], [[spring onion]] and [[chive]]. [[Spinach]], [[watercress]], and [[matrimony vine]] are produced in the cooler months. [[Yardlong bean]]s, [[water spinach]], [[amaranth]], [[cucumber]], and several species of Chinese [[gourd]] are produced in summer. A wide range of temperate vegetables including [[tomato]], [[sweet pepper]], [[cauliflower]], [[carrot]], and [[celery]] are grown in [[winter]].

Flower cultivation has gained importance in recent years. [[Gladiolus]], [[lily]], and [[chrysanthemum]] are grown in winter; and [[ginger lily]] and [[lotus (genus)|lotus]] flower in summer. [[Peach]] blossom is grown especially for the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]]. A wide range of fruit is grown on the lower hill slopes, the main types being [[lychee]], [[longan]], [[wampei]], local [[lemon]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tangerine]], [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[banana]].

==Animal husbandry==
There were 281 local pig farms and 205 local poultry farms in 2004. During 2003, local pig production was valued at $527 million and local poultry production, including [[pigeons]] and [[egg (biology)|eggs]] was valued at $250 million. Pigs raised on local farms are crosses derived from Duroc, [[Landrace]] and Large White parent stock. The majority of local [[chicken]]s raised on farms are Shek Ki cross bred chickens. Recently, brand name chickens like Ka Mei chickens and Tai On chickens have been introduced to local market by local investors. There are two [[dairy|dairies]] in active operation with a total herd population of less than 50 cows.

==Agricultural development==
The [[Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department]] (AFCD) and its closely related marketing organisations provide infrastructural support and technical services to the various [[primary industries]]. The department’s crop specialists undertake studies into practical problems in pest control, crop husbandry and soil management. They also investigate specific production technologies to enhance the efficiency and economic benefits of the industry. This work is carried out in an experimental station in [[Sheung Shui]] and results are made available to farmers by the department’s advisory service. 

Agricultural advisory activities are aimed at assisting farmers to improve productivity through the introduction of new and improved produce varieties and production techniques, backed up by adequate credit facilities and efficient and orderly marketing services. Studies are currently under way to adapt and develop greenhouse and organic production technology for local farms. Examples of well-received new produce varieties are: supersweet [[maize]], heat tolerant lettuce, coloured [[sweet pepper]], [[spaghetti squash]], [[strawberry]] and white bitter cucumber. 

Loans issued to farmers in 2003 amounted to $19 million and the total value of loans issued up to December 31, 2003 (under three separate loan funds administered by AFCD) was $505 million. These loans are granted to cover farm production and development purposes . Agricultural development also includes improvement of basic infrastructure, rehabilitation of fallow land and studies in farm management problems. Infrastructural work concentrates on the maintenance and improvement of communal irrigation and drainage facilities. 

An Accredited Farm Scheme for protecting the environment and consumers against residues of agricultural [[pesticide]]s was introduced in 1994. Accredited farms are strictly monitored and supervised on uses of pesticides and produce is further checked for pesticide residue before they are sold at accredited retail outlets. At the end of 2003, a total of 224 farms in Hong Kong and the mainland of China were accredited, supplying more than 70 tonnes
