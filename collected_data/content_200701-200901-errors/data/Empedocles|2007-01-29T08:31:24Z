'''Empedocles''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Polytonic|Εμπεδοκλής}}, circa [[490 BCE|490]] [[Common era|BCE]] &ndash; c. [[430 BCE]]) was a [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] [[presocratic]] [[philosopher]] and a citizen of [[Agrigentum]], a Greek colony in [[Sicily]]. Empedocles' philosophy is best known for being the origin of the [[cosmogenesis|cosmogenic]] theory of the four [[classical elements]]. Little of the verse that Empedocles wrote survives today, and, as with many of the presocratics, much of what is known about his philosophy comes from commentary upon it by later thinkers. Empedocles' death has been the subject of both legend and a number of literary treatments.

==Philosophy==
Empedocles maintained that all [[matter]] is made up of four elements: [[water (classical element)|water]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[air (classical element)|air]] and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]. Empedocles called these the four "roots"; the term "element (''stoicheion'')", meaning literally "syllable", was used only by later writers.

Apart from these four roots, Empedocles postulated something called [[Love]] ''(philia)'' to explain the attraction of different forms of matter, and of something called Strife ''(neikos)'' to account for their separation. These ideas should not be confused with the four elements: if the elements are the content of the universe, then Love and Strife explain their variation and harmony. He was also one of the first people to state the theory that [[light]] travels at a finite (although very large) speed, a theory that gained acceptance only much later.

Though having much in common with [[Parmenides]]'s [[ontology]], Empedocles is considered to be more tolerant and soft in his outlook. [[Plato]], in the famous ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' [[dialogue]], described Empedocles as a "gentle muse":

:''Then there are Ionian, and in more recent times Sicilian muses, who have arrived at the conclusion that to unite the two principles is safer, and to say that being is one and many, and that these are held together by enmity and friendship, ever parting, ever meeting, as the-severer Muses assert, while the gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace, but admit a relaxation and alternation of them; peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway of Aphrodite, and then again plurality and war, by reason of a principle of strife.'' ([[Plato]], ''Soph.'').

Empedocles was also a mystic and a poet, and some consider him the inventor of the study of [[rhetoric]]{{fact}}. [[Gorgias]] of Leontini was his student, and it is probably from Empedocles that Gorgias developed the notion of rhetoric as magic{{fact}}.

As a person he was perceived by some as somewhat arrogant, dressing himself in purple and claiming that by the virtue of the knowledge he possessed he had become divine and could perform miracles{{fact}}. Yet his actions and teaching betrayed an [[egalitarian]] streak, he fought to preserve Greek [[democracy]] and allowed that through his teaching others could also become divine{{fact}}. He even went so far to suggest that all living things were on the same spiritual plane, indicating he was influenced by [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] spirituality{{fact}}. Like Pythagoras, he believed in the [[Metempsychosis|transmigration of souls]] between humans and animals and followed a [[vegetarian]] lifestyle. He also propounded a theory of struggle in the animal kingdom that in some ways prefigures [[natural selection]]. {{fact}}

Empedocles is considered the last Greek philosopher to write in verse and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from his two poems, ''Purifications'' and ''On Nature''.

==Death and literary treatments==
Empedocles' life was recorded by [[Diogenes Laertius]]. The legend goes that he died by throwing himself into an active volcano ([[Mount Etna]] in Sicily), so that people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; however, the volcano threw back one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. The legend is likely to have little truth within it; there is evidence that he actually died in Greece{{fact}}.

In ''Icaro-Menippus'', a comedic dialogue written by the second century satirist [[Lucian of Samosata]], Empedocles’s final fate is re-evaluated. Rather than being incinerated in the fires of Mount Etna, he was carried up into the heavens by a volcanic eruption. Although a bit singed by the ordeal, Empedocles survives and continues his life on the moon, surviving by feeding on dew.

Empedocles' death has inspired two major modern literary treatments. Empedocles's death is the subject of [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s play ''Tod des Empedokles'' (''Death of Empedocles''), two versions of which were written between the years 1798 and 1800. A third version was made public in 1826. In [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem ''Empedocles on Etna'', a narrative of the philosopher's last hours before he jumps to his death in the crater first published in 1852, Empedocles predicts:

:To the elements it came from
:Everything will return.
:Our bodies to earth,
:Our blood to water,
:Heat to fire,
:Breath to air.

In 2006, a massive underwater volcano off the coast of Sicily was named after Empedocles [http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/06/22/underwater.volcano.reut/index.html].
