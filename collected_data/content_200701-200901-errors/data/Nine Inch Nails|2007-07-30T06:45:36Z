'''Nine Inch Nails''' (abbreviated as '''NI<!--Please do not use И; it is the Cyrillic letter I-->N<!--Please do not use И; it is the Cyrillic letter I-->''') is an [[United States|American]] [[industrial rock]] band that was formed in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] circa 1988 by [[Trent Reznor]]. As its main [[Producer (music)|producer]], singer, songwriter, and [[instrumentalist]], Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for the musical direction of the band. His lyrics are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self, and the time between major studio albums (bridged by releases of [[remix]]es and [[live album]]s) has been extended by Reznor's battles with personal issues. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles a [[Nine Inch Nails: Live|live band]] to tour with him extensively; this live component is generally considered a separate entity from Nine Inch Nails in the [[recording studio]]. On stage, NIN <!--Avoid the Cyrillic letter, please--> employs spectacular visual elements, and the performances often culminate in the destruction of musical instruments.<ref name="Reimink">{{cite news| author=Reimink, Troy| title= Changes in songs, lineup keep Nails sharp |work=[[Grand Rapids Press]] |pages= D1 |date= [[2007-03-05]] |url=http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=287 |accessdate= 2007-02-28}}</ref>

NI<!--Please do not use И; it is the Cyrillic letter I-->N's music straddles a wide range of genres and techniques while retaining a characteristically intense sound. [[Underground music]] audiences warmly received the band's early activity, and Nine Inch Nails went on to produce several highly influential releases in the 1990s to international acclaim, including two [[Grammy Awards]]. Media coverage of NIN reached a peak in 1997, when ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Trent Reznor one of the 25 most influential people in America.<ref name="Time">{{cite journal |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986206-17,00.html |title= Time's 25 most influential Americans |journal= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= [[1997-04-21]] |volume=149 |issue=16 |pages= 66 |accessdate = 2007-03-05}}</ref> The [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] estimates that Nine Inch Nails has sold at least 12 million units of all of its albums in the United States alone.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topartists.asp |title= Best Sellers: Gold & Platinum Top Artists |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |date= [[2006-07-31]] |accessdate= 2007-02-05}}</ref> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on their list of the 100 greatest music artists of all time.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Nine Inch Nails |last= Bowie |first= David |authorlink=David Bowie |journal= [[Rolling Stone]] |issue=972 |date=[[2005-04-21]] |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7250012/94_nine_inch_nails |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years===
Initial ambitions for Nine Inch Nails were modest: in 1988, Reznor hoped to release one [[12-inch single]] on a small European label.<ref name= "AP90">{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/getdowninit.shtml |title= Getting Down in It |date= March 1990 |journal= [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |issue= 27 |accessdate= 2006-10-30}}</ref> At that time, Reznor was employed as a programmer (and janitor)<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |author= Huey, Steve |url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jxkcikv6bbf9~T10 |title= Nine Inch Nails |accessdate= 2006-11-24 |publisher= [[All Music Guide]]}}</ref> by Bart Koster, owner of [[Midtown Recording|Right Track Studios]] in Cleveland. Reznor asked to engineer some [[Demo (music)|demo recordings]] of his own songs at night during unused studio time, free of charge; Koster agreed, remarking that it cost him "just a little wear on [his] tape heads".<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://nothing.nin.net/int12.html |title= The music of rage |journal= [[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=43 |issue=5 |last=Dougherty |first= Steve |coauthors=Bryan Alexander, Tom Nugent, John Hannah |date= [[1995-02-06]] |pages=105–107 |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}</ref> While recording the earliest NIN tracks, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted and instead decided to play all the instruments himself. For the band's studio recordings, this role largely remains Reznor's, though he has since involved other musicians and assistants. Several labels responded favorably to Reznor's material, and he chose to sign with [[TVT Records]]. Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released in 1994 as ''[[Purest Feeling]]''; Reznor completed five of these, dropped the others, and wrote several new songs to complete the first NIN album, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]''.

Several rumors have persisted about the origins of the name "Nine Inch Nails", one being that Reznor chose to reference the story of Jesus' crucifixion with nine inch spikes.<ref name = "Shock">{{cite book |first= Greg |last= Rule |title= Electro Shock!: Groundbreakers of Synth Music |publisher= Backbeat Books |year= 1999 |id= ISBN 0-8793-0582-7}}</ref> Others have surmised that Reznor was inspired by the sight of nine inch fingernails on [[Freddy Krueger]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.spin.com/features/magazine/columns/chuck_klosterman/2006/03/0603_chuck/ |title= Arriving late to the Nine Inch Nails party |last= Klosterman |first= Chuck |authorlink= Chuck Klosterman |publisher = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date= March 1992 |accessdate = 2006-11-01}}</ref> Reznor asserts that he coined the name partly because it "abbreviated easily", rather than for "any literal meaning".<ref name = "Axcess">{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/axc94a.shtml | title = Talking about Nothing with Trent Reznor |journal= Axcess |volume = 2 |date= 1994 |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref> Gary Talpas and Reznor designed the distinctive Nine Inch Nails logo (consisting of the letters "NIN" set inside a border with the second "N" reversed), which first appeared on debut single "[[Down in It]]" and was inspired by [[Tibor Kalman]]'s typography on the [[Talking Heads]] album cover for ''[[Remain in Light]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/access/7_21_04/questions5.gif |title= Response from Trent |date= [[2004-07-21]] |last= Reznor |first=Trent |authorlink = Trent Reznor |publisher= [http://nin.com The official NIN website] |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref> Talpas, a Clevelander, would continue to design NIN packaging art through the 1997 double [[VHS]] ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=

===''Pretty Hate Machine''===
{{main|Pretty Hate Machine}}
[[Image:Nin-pretty_hate_machine.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]''<br>(1989)]]
Written, arranged, and performed by Trent Reznor, NIN's first album '''''Pretty Hate Machine''''' debuted in 1989. The album expands upon the ''Purest Feeling'' demos with the addition of studio production and several new songs (including singles "[[Down in It]]", "[[Head Like a Hole]]" and "[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]"), marking Reznor's first collaboration with [[Adrian Sherwood]] (who produced "Down in It" in [[London, England]] without having met Reznor face-to-face)<ref name = "AP90" /> and [[Flood (producer)|Mark "Flood" Ellis]]. Flood's production would appear on each major NIN release until 1994, and Sherwood has done remixes for the band as recently as 2000. The songs on ''Pretty Hate Machine'' feature catchy melodies set against dark, introspective lyrics; Reznor proclaimed this combination "a sincere statement" of "what was in [his] head at the time".<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/thrash.shtml |author= Martin, Steve |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]] |date= 1990 |accessdate= 2006-10-30}}</ref> In the album's liner notes, Reznor thanks [[Horror fiction|horror fiction]] writer [[Clive Barker]] for inspiration. [[MTV]] aired videos for "Down in It" and "Head Like a Hole", but an explicit video for "Sin" was not released until 1997 on ''Closure'' (in edited form). Spending two years on the album charts, ''Pretty Hate Machine'' became one of the first [[Indie (music)|independently released]] records to go [[RIAA certification|platinum]].<ref name="AMG" />

Nine Inch Nails first toured North America opening for industrial band [[Skinny Puppy]] as well as [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].<ref name="AMG" /> Reznor soon received a reputation for smashing instruments on stage out of frustration. This aggressive attitude won over NIN's earliest audiences, who often were openly hostile toward synthesizer-based bands.<ref name = "Rockbeat">{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart198.shtml |title= The man behind the machine |author= Gitter, Mike |journal= Rockbeat |date= 1992 |accessdate= 2006-12-06}}</ref> NIN then supported ''Pretty Hate Machine'' with a world tour that continued through the first [[Lollapalooza]] festival in 1991, where the band "stole the show" from headliners [[Jane's Addiction]] despite numerous equipment problems.<ref name = "Huxley">{{cite book |last= Huxley |first= Martin |title= Nine Inch Nails: Self Destruct |year= 1997 |month= September |publisher= St. Martin's Griffin
| id = ISBN 0-3121-5612-X}}</ref> After receiving a disastrous European reception opening for [[Guns N' Roses]], NIN returned to America amid pressure from TVT to produce a more commercial follow-up to ''Pretty Hate Machine''. In response, Reznor secretly began recording ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]'' under [[Pseudonym|assumed name]]s to avoid record company interference.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/musica.shtml |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |date= March 1994 |accessdate= 2006-12-02}}</ref>

===''Broken''===
{{main|Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)}}
{{Unreferencedsection|date=July 2007}}
[[Image:Nin-broken.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]''<br>(1992)]]
The fruit of Reznor's disillusionment with his record label and culmination of the band's harsh, aggressive live sound, the '''''Broken''''' [[Extended Play|EP]] of six songs plus two bonus tracks was released in 1992. In the liner notes, Reznor credits his band from the 1991 tour as an influence on ''Broken'', a guitar-based "blast of destruction".<ref name = "Shock" />

[[Peter Christopherson|Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson]] of [[Coil (band)|Coil]] directed a performance video for "[[Wish (song)|Wish]]," but the most infamous video made for the album was "[[Happiness in Slavery]]". The latter video was almost universally [[censorship|banned]] for its graphic depiction of [[performance art]]ist [[Bob Flanagan]] stripping naked and lying on a machine that subsequently pleasures, tortures and then kills him. A third video, "Pinion," aired twice on MTV before once again being banned for objectionable content (although images from it did become a fixture in the opening title sequence of the MTV show ''180 Minutes''). Combining these videos with other shocking footage for "Help Me I Am in Hell" and "Gave Up," Christopherson and Reznor created a longform music video informally called ''[[Broken (film)|The Broken Movie]]'', which depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch Nine Inch Nails videos. This mini-film has not been officially released, but was widely traded and sold on VHS in the mid nineties. In early 2007, a high quality video began to appear on peer-to-peer file sharing sites. An alternate studio performance video for "Gave Up," featuring [[Richard Patrick]] and [[Marilyn Manson]], was filmed at [[10050 Cielo Drive|Le Pig studios]] (site of the [[Charles Manson]] murders). A 1995 live performance of "Wish" also was filmed, and both videos were included on the ''Closure'' compilation in 1997.

''Broken'' was followed by the remix EP ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]'' in late 1992. Rather than tour in support of either EP, Reznor returned to Le Pig and began working on a full-length follow-up.

===''The Downward Spiral''===
{{main|The Downward Spiral}}
[[Image:Nin-the downward spiral800.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[The Downward Spiral]]''<br>(1994)]]
NIN released its second full album in 1994, '''''The Downward Spiral''''', which came out on the [[Billboard 200]] at number two.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cleveland.com/kidsnewsday/content.ssf?/homegrown/index.ssf?/homegrown/more/reznor/timeline.html |title= Trent Reznor: Timeline |publisher= Cleveland.com |accessdate= 2006-12-18}}</ref> ''The Downward Spiral'' eventually became the highest-selling NIN release in the [[USA]].<ref name="RIAA.com" /> Inspired by late-1970s rock albums ''[[Low (album)|Low]]'' and ''[[The Wall (album)|The Wall]]'', ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' features a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress of a central character.<ref name = "Details">{{cite journal |url= http://9inchnails.com/articles/articles.php?id=13 |title= The art of darkness |last= Heath |first= Chris | authorlink = Chris Heath |journal= [[Details (magazine)|Details]] |date= April 1995 |accessdate= 2006-12-18}}</ref> Most of it was [[mix engineer]]ed by [[Alan Moulder]], who would take on more extensive production duties for subsequent NIN albums.

The album spawned two commercial singles ("[[March of the Pigs]]" and "[[Closer to God|Closer]]") and two additional tracks ("[[Hurt (song)|Hurt]]" and "Piggy") that were issued to radio without a commercial single release. The "Closer" video directed by [[Mark Romanek]] set a standard for NIN videos with its images of a pig's head, dead meat, a nude woman, and [[BDSM]] paraphernalia. MTV made significant edits to the video for objectionable content but broadcast the edited version frequently. A censored radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics received extensive radio airtime. 

"Hurt" enjoyed renewed success when it was [[Cover version|covered]] by [[Johnny Cash]] in 2002 to great acclaim. Reznor has stated that hearing Cash's cover revitalized his interest in writing music and partly inspired the stripped-down approach to songwriting for ''With Teeth''.<ref>{{cite book |last= DeCurtis |first= Anthony |authorlink= Anthony DeCurtis |title= In Other Words |chapter= Trent Reznor on 'Hurt' |publisher= Hal Leonard |origyear= 2005 |id= ISBN 0-6340-6655-2}}</ref> David Bowie sang a duet of "Hurt" with Reznor on the ''Dissonance'' concert tour in 1995. This and other performances from NIN's marathon ''Self Destruct'' tour were documented on ''Closure''. The Nine Inch Nails live band also made appearances in performance videos for "Hurt" and "Eraser," which were not issued to MTV, as well as "March of the Pigs" (re-recorded in-studio with one camera in a single take).

Widely regarded as NIN's most influential [[magnum opus]], ''The Downward Spiral'' marked a high point for the band, which reached its widest ever mainstream audience with a mud-drenched performance at [[Woodstock '94]], broadcast on [[Pay-Per-View]] and seen in as many as 24 million homes.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16319994.html |title= Feedback muddy from Woodstock PPV |author= Umstead, R. Thomas |journal= Multichannel News |date= [[1994-08-22]] |volume= 15 |issue = 32 |pages= 3–4 |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}</ref> Many other artists began citing Reznor as an influence after the release of ''The Downward Spiral'',<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |title= Geoff Rickly interviews Trent Reznor |last= Rickly |first= Geoff |authorlink= Geoff Rickly |journal= [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date= [[2004-06-26]] |accessdate= 2006-12-11}}</ref> and Nine Inch Nails received considerable mainstream success in the mid-1990s, affording the venues for an expanded live show with [[arena rock]] production values, thereby adding highly theatrical visual elements to an already overwhelming live show.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xreview1.shtml |title= The Pit: Nine Inch Nails |journal= Guitar School |date= May 1995 |accessdate= 2006-12-21}}</ref> 

At the same time, Reznor's relentless studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction and bouts of writer's block began to elongate the time between major NIN releases.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/ap_97d_a.shtml |title= Trent Reznor |journal= [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date= January 1998 |issue=114 |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}</ref><ref name = "Hell">{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=21 |title= To Hell and back |author= Chick, Steve |journal= [[Kerrang!]] |date=[[2005-03-30]] |accessdate= 2006-12-12}}</ref> This served to increase fan anticipation for the band's next move during the wait between releases.  Reznor's appearance in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on the list of 1997's 25 most influential people solidified his status as "the most vital artist in music";<ref name="Time" /> however, the end of NIN's first decade was characterized by a very long tour in support of ''The Downward Spiral'' followed by an even longer period of relative silence.

After ''The Downward Spiral'', Reznor produced a remix album entitled ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', the only non-major NIN release to be certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the US.<ref name="RIAA.com" /> It featured contributions from electronic music pioneer [[Aphex Twin]] and Jane's Addiction guitarist [[Dave Navarro]]. There are two versions of ''Further Down the Spiral'', both featuring exclusive content. A 10th anniversary reissue of ''The Downward Spiral'' was released on [[November 23]], [[2004]], as a two-disc "Deluxe Edition" package. The first disc, a hybrid [[Super Audio CD|SACD]], featured the entire album in high definition [[Multichannel audio|5.1 surround sound]] and a remastered version of the original CD stereo mix. The second disc featured album b-sides, previously unavailable demos, and other non-album tracks in remastered stereo sound. The first disc was released concurrently as a two-sided [[DualDisc]] playable in standard DVD players as well as high-definition [[DVD-Audio]] players and most traditional CD players.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/current/archive1.html |title=Nine Inch Nails: Current (archive) |publisher= [http://www.nin.com/ the official NIN website] |author= Sheridan, Rob |date= [[2004-10-03]] |accessdate= 2006-12-12}}</ref>

===''The Fragile''===
{{main|The Fragile}}
[[Image:nin-the_fragile800.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[The Fragile]]''<br>(1999)]]
Fans waited five years between ''The Downward Spiral'' and NIN's next major release, '''''The Fragile''''', which arrived as a [[double CD]] in [[1999]]. Dense in musical texture but lyrically sparse, the album was built around "sound-scapes," according to Reznor, in which "songwriting and arranging and production and sound design[...] became the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/bands/n/nin/news_feature_050509/index2.jhtml |title= The upward spiral |publisher= [[MTV]] |author= Moss, Corey |date= May 2005 |accessdate= 2006-12-18}}</ref> 

On the heels of NIN's previous successes, media anticipation surrounded ''The Fragile'' before its release.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart47.shtml |title= NIN Album on Horizon |work= Daily News Online |date= August 1998 |accessdate= 2006-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart45.shtml |title= Nine Inch Nails - Ball of confusion |journal = [[Hit Parader]] |date= September 1998 |accessdate= 2006-12-09}}</ref> After many delays, it finally debuted on top of the [[Billboard 200]], selling 228,000 copies in one week and receiving generally favorable reviews. Without sufficient promotion from [[Interscope Records]], however, it slipped out of the charts soon afterward, and Reznor was forced to pay for the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart229.shtml |title= Rock's outlook bleak, but this Nail won't bend |author= Soeder, John |publisher= Cleveland.com |date=[[2000-04-09]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' hailed it as the "album of the year," and several songs from ''The Fragile'' were regular features on alt-rock radio stations.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart150.shtml |title= Rock radio pumps up volume |author = Kaufman, Gil |work = SonicNet News |date=[[1999-12-02]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}</ref>

Canadian rock producer [[Bob Ezrin]] was consulted on the album's track listing; the liner notes state that he "provided final continuity and flow," suggesting an arrangement of songs that would strengthen their overall cohesiveness. Ezrin, who has also produced classic albums by [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Alice Cooper]], would in 2007 describe Reznor as a "true visionary".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.torontoist.com/archives/2007/04/thank_god_for_t.php |title='Thank God for Trent Reznor' |publisher= The Torontoist |date=[[2007-04-19]] |accessdate=2007-04-20 |first=Marc |last=Lostracco}}</ref>

In advance of the album's release, fans speculated that the song "[[Starfuckers, Inc.]]" was a parody of Reznor's former friend and protégé, [[Marilyn Manson (person)|Marilyn Manson]]. According to this view, the lyrics satirized Manson as being vain and insincere.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart79.shtml |title= Provocative, pounding new NIN songs leaked to radio |author = Kaufman, Gil |work = SonicNet News |date= [[1999-07-14]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}</ref> Manson and Reznor soon put aside their differences; Manson co-directed and appeared in the music video (retitled "Starsuckers, Inc.") and performed the song alongside NIN at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 2000. NIN released three singles from the album in different territories: "[[The Day the World Went Away]]" in North America; "[[We're in This Together]]" in the [[EU]] and Japan (on three separate discs); and an EP with "[[Into the Void (Nine Inch Nails song)|Into the Void]]" as its lead track in [[Australia]]. MTV aired videos for the latter two tracks, as well as "Starsuckers, Inc."

Reznor followed ''The Fragile'' with another remix album, ''[[Things Falling Apart]]''. This was released soon after the 2000 ''Fragility'' tour, itself recorded and released on CD, [[DVD]] and VHS in 2002 as ''[[And All that Could Have Been]]''. A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc ''[[Still (Nine Inch Nails album)|Still]]'', featuring stripped-down re-interpretations of songs from the band's entire career along with several new pieces of music. Some of ''Still'' originated in Reznor's unreleased score for Mark Romanek's film ''[[One Hour Photo]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nin.com/access/5_07_04/questions1.gif | title = Response from Trent | date = [[2004-05-07]] |last= Reznor |first=Trent |authorlink= Trent Reznor |publisher= [http://www.nin.com The official NIN website] |accessdate= 2006-12-02}}</ref> and three videos for it were released on the official NIN website.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/visuals/ |title= Nine Inch Nails: Visuals |accessdate= 2006-12-28}}</ref>

NIN's fifth album, released in 2005, was written and recorded following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse: the lyrics of '''''With Teeth''''' reflect this struggle.<ref name="SMH">{{cite web |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/hammer-time-over/2005/08/04/1122748732635.html |title= Hammer time over |author= Roberts, Jo |publisher= [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= [[2005-08-05]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref> While most critics hailed the album as a "return to form" after ''The Fragile'', some criticized ''With Teeth'' for being trite and unoriginal.<ref name = "PopMatters">{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/n/nineinchnails-withteeth.shtml |title= "Nine Inch Nails: With Teeth" |publisher= [http://www.popmatters.com PopMatters] |author= Schiller, Mike |date= [[2005-05-18]] |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}</ref> ''With Teeth'', which [[Internet leak|leaked]] prior to its official release date of [[3 May]], [[2005]], contains guest appearances by [[Dave Grohl]] on drums and live percussion.

In April of 2005, Trent Reznor released the source files for "The Hand that Feeds" in [[GarageBand]] format, allowing his fans to remix it. This release spawned an unofficial remix contest, in which over 500 fan remixes were submitted.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ninremixes.com/about.php |title= NINRemixes.com History |accessdate= 2007-05-08}}</ref> In response to this successful experiment, Reznor released the source files for the album's second single, "[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]" in a wider range of formats, including [[ProTools]] and [[ACID Pro]]. Fans were also invited to access the band's official [[MySpace]] page to upload remixes, vote for favorites, and comment about them in a [[blog]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.myspace.com/ninremixes |title= NIN remixes |publisher= [[MySpace]] |accessdate= 2006-12-24}}</ref> [[David Fincher]] directed a video for "Only" using primarily [[computer-generated imagery]]; it debuted [[July 11]], [[2005]] on [[Fuse channel|Fuse]]. The third single from ''With Teeth'', "[[Every Day Is Exactly the Same]]", was released in April 2006.

In the months following the release of ''With Teeth'', two new songs surfaced: "Non-Entity" (first performed by Reznor solo at the ''ReactNow!'' [[Hurricane Katrina]] [[benefit concert]]) and "Not So Pretty Now", both of which have appeared on set lists of the ''With Teeth'' tour. During a chat with fans on the official NIN fan club, The Spiral, Reznor stated that these songs were outtakes from the ''With Teeth'' sessions, and studio recordings of them may surface.<ref name="Spiral">{{cite web |url=http://www.nin-thespiral.com |title= The Spiral (registration required) |accessdate= 2006-12-24}}</ref> A live recording of "Non-Entity" appears on ''Beside You in Time''.

In autumn 2005, Nine Inch Nails launched a North American [[arena]] tour supported by [[Queens of the Stone Age]], as well as [[Autolux]] and [[Death from Above 1979]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/tour/previous2.html |title= On tour 2005 |accessdate= 2006-12-12}}</ref> Other opening acts on this tour included [[The Dresden Dolls]], [[Saul Williams]] (for whom Reznor is producing a "genre-breaking" album), and [[Moving Units]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nin.com/tour/previous3.html |title= On tour 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-12}}</ref> To conclude the ''With Teeth'' era of the band, NIN did a tour of US [[Amphitheatre#Other amphitheatres|amphitheaters]] in the summer of 2006.

==Corporate entanglements==
===TVT Records and Nothing Records===

In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band.<ref name = "Shock" /> Ultimately TVT entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records that allowed Reznor to begin releasing NIN albums on his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.<ref name = "Huxley" /> In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager [[John Malm, Jr.]], co-founder of Nothing, for [[breach of contract]] and breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=102 |title= NIN's Reznor: I was duped by manager |date= [[2005-05-17]] |publisher= [[Associated Press]] |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}</ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with all claims awarded to Reznor (a sum in excess of three million dollars).<ref name = "E!

The ownership rights to ''Pretty Hate Machine'' were put on auction by TVT in 2005 at the behest of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Securities]] bankruptcy proceedings. They offered the album as part of an overall package that included the rights to the ''Television's Greatest Hits'' compilations and the ''[[Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat]]'' movie soundtracks. In addition, the highest bidder was offered a percentage of future sales in all of Nine Inch Nails' TVT-related releases. [[Rykodisc]], who did not win the auction but were able to license the rights from Prudential, re-issued ''Pretty Hate Machine'' on [[November 22]], [[2005]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/05/10#1130439320 |title= Rykodisk to reissue pretty hate machine *updated* |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2005-10-27]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref> Ryko also reissued the vinyl edition of the album and its "Head Like a Hole" CD single on [[January 31]], [[2006]], and wanted to release a deluxe edition of the album (as Interscope had done for ''The Downward Spiral'' tenth anniversary) as well; however, Reznor was not willing to produce it without payment.<ref name = "Toronto Sun">{{cite news |url= http://www.torontosun.com/Entertainment/Music/2005/11/08/1297497-sun.html |title= Reznor grits his teeth |author= Ladouceur, Liisa |work= [[The Toronto Sun]] |date= [[2005-11-08]] |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref>

===2005 MTV Movie Awards===

Nine Inch Nails dropped out of the 2005 [[MTV Movie Awards]] show because of a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of [[George W. Bush]] as a backdrop to the band's performance of "The Hand that Feeds", which includes such lyrics as:

:''What if this whole crusade's a charade''
:''And behind it all there's a price to be paid''
:''For the blood on which we dine''
:''Justified in the name of the holy and the divine''

On [[May 26]], [[2005]], Reznor wrote "apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me" on the NIN website.<ref name = "E! Online" /> MTV replied that they respected Reznor's point of view, but were "uncomfortable" with the performance being "built around partisan political statements". A performance by the [[Foo Fighters]] replaced NIN's time slot on the show.<ref name = "E! Online" />

===Fox News===

On [[October 24]], [[2006]], after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a [[cease and desist]] to [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] for using three songs from ''The Fragile'' on air without permission. The songs ("La Mer", "The Great Below" and "The Mark Has Been Made") appeared in an episode of ''[[War Stories with Oliver North]]'' detailing the [[battle of Iwo Jima]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/06/10#1161617908 |title= Fox News, War Stories, and Nine Inch Nails |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2006-10-23]] |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}</ref> A post appeared on Reznor's blog, which read: "Thanks for the Fox News heads-up.

===Recording Industry Association of America===

As part of the [[Year Zero (alternate reality game)|alternate reality game]] which accompanied the release of ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'', three tracks from the album were intentionally "leaked" prior to the album's release at a number of NIN concerts on [[USB flash drive|USB drives]].<ref name="CoolerThanLost" /><ref name="twighlightleak">{{cite web | url = http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/07/2#1172453827 | title = The contents of tonight's USB key… | publisher=The NIN Hotline | date = [[2007-02-25]] | accessdate = 2007-02-25}}</ref>  The high-quality, pre-release mp3s quickly circulated the internet.  Owners of the websites soon received "cease and desist" orders from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails' record label.<ref name="BillboardPaolette">{{cite web | last = Paoletta | first = Michael | title = Online Odyssey Stoking Interest In New NIN Album  | publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' | date = 2007-03-30 | url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003565585 | accessdate = 2007-05-20}}</ref>  The source that broke the story was quoted as saying "These fucking idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on."<ref name="BillboardPaolette" />

===Universal Music Group===

On [[May 13]], [[2007]] Reznor made a post on [http://www.nin.com/tr/default.aspx his blog] on the official Nine Inch Nails website condemning [[Universal Music Group]] for their pricing and distribution plans for ''Year Zero''.<ref name="RollingStoneKreps">{{cite web | last = Kreps | first = Daniel | title = Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor Slams Records Labels for Sorry State of the Industry | publisher = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 2007-05-14 | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/05/14/nine-inch-nails-trent-reznor-slams-records-labels-for-sorry-state-of-the-industry/ | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>  The full text of that post is as follows:

{{cquote|As the climate grows more and more desperate for record labels, their answer to their mostly self-inflicted wounds seems to be to screw the consumer over even more. A couple of examples that quickly come to mind:

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The ABSURD retail pricing of Year Zero in Australia. Shame on you, UMG. Year Zero is selling for $34.99 Australian dollars ($29.10 US). No wonder people steal music. Avril Lavigne's record in the same store was $21.99 ($18.21 US).
By the way, when I asked a label rep about this his response was: "It's because we know you have a real core audience that will pay whatever it costs when you put something out - you know, true fans. It's the pop stuff we have to discount to get people to buy."
So... I guess as a reward for being a "true fan" you get ripped off.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The dreaded EURO Maxi-single. Nothing but a consumer rip-off that I've been talked into my whole career. No more.

The point is, I am trying my best to make sure the music and items NIN puts in the marketplace have value, substance and are worth you considering purchasing. I am not allowing Capital G to be repackaged into several configurations that result in you getting ripped off.

We are planning a full-length remix collection of substance that will be announced soon.}}

Reznor's post, specifically his citing of the record-industries' "self-inflicted wounds," elicited considerable media attention.<ref name="Reznor Smashes UMG">{{cite web | title = Reznor Smashes UMG, Websites Write About It | publisher=The NIN Hotline | date = 2007-05-17 | url = http://www.theninhotline.net/news/index.php#1179461909 | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>

==Discography==
{{main|Nine Inch Nails discography}}
{{Unreferencedsection|date=July 2007}}
Nine Inch Nails has issued six major studio albums; each is accompanied by numerous satellite releases, including [[remix album]]s, [[single (music)|singles]] with extensive [[b-side]]s, and tour documentaries. Indeed, each primary release is seen as the center of an associated era, in which the secondary releases are vital to understanding the artistic whole. This is underscored by the use of [[Nine Inch Nails discography#Halo numbers|''Halo'' numbers]], a sequential numbering system that applies to every official NIN release. ''Halo'' numbers may be interpreted to imply that each release is an equally-weighted component of the catalog, regardless of length or format; they could also be considered as marketing enticement for fans to complete their collections.

Nine Inch Nails has recorded five songs specifically for film soundtracks: a cover of [[Joy Division]]'s "Dead Souls" for ''[[The Crow (album)|The Crow]]'', "[[Burn (Nine Inch Nails song)|Burn]]" and a reworked version of "Something I Can Never Have" for ''[[Natural Born Killers (soundtrack)|Natural Born Killers]]'', "[["The Perfect Drug" Versions|The Perfect Drug]]" for ''[[Lost Highway (soundtrack)|Lost Highway]]'', and "[[Deep (song)|Deep]]" for ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. Reznor himself has remixed a number of songs by other artists, only a few of which are [[Nine Inch Nails discography#Remixes|credited to NIN]].

Sound effects and 10 instrumental background music tracks were recorded for the game ''[[Quake]]'', credited to [[Trent Reznor]] and Nine Inch Nails.  Most of the songs were of a simple, dark ambient style that lacked much melody, although the title screen song contained a melody that is well-known to even Quake's most casual fans.  The game itself featured influences from the artist musically, aesthetically and also functionally. Two different nail guns featured as key weapons; the ammunition box for these weapons was also adorned with the NIN logo in recognition of [[Trent Reznor]]'s input.

===Prospective Re-releases===
Reznor has stated that he would like to release remastered editions of ''Pretty Hate Machine'', ''Broken''/''Fixed'' and ''The Fragile'' akin to ''The Downward Spiral'' tenth anniversary re-release.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/access/12_03_04/ |title= Responses from Trent |last= Reznor |first= Trent |authorlink= Trent Reznor |date= [[2004-12-03]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref> A deluxe DVD version of the 1997 VHS release ''Closure'' was delivered to [[Interscope Records]] in 2004. They were reportedly working on the interactive menu artwork as late as December 2005.  No release date has been set, but both discs appeared on [[BitTorrent]] networks in December 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/05/12#1134412727 |title= Closer to Closure? |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2005-12-12]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref>

== Musical characteristics ==
{{Inline audio|section}}
[[Image:NineInchNails.jpg|thumb|left|Nine Inch Nails live on tour in 2005]]
Nine Inch Nails' music has been categorized as [[Rock and roll|rock]], [[electronica]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], or, most commonly, [[industrial rock]].<ref name="AMG" /> This latter categorization upset [[industrial music]] "purists", most of whom disdained the application of the term to what could be regarded as [[pop song]]s. Reznor has never referred to his music as industrial but admits to borrowing techniques from such bands as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Test Dept.]]<ref name="Axcess" /> Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term "industrial" and NIN itself, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. In actuality, the band's output has covered a wide range of genres: "The Perfect Drug" has the flavor of [[drum and bass]], "Down in It" was influenced by early Skinny Puppy (particularly their song "[[Dig It (single)|Dig It]]"),<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://9inchnails.com/articles/articles.php?id=17 |title= An interview with Trent Reznor |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date= March 1996 |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref> "Happiness in Slavery" is tinged with [[industrial metal]] in the vein of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], "The Frail" is a melancholy piano piece, and most of ''Pretty Hate Machine'' could be described as dark electronic pop.

While it displays uncommonly versatile sonic design and composition for a [[rock band]], certain techniques and styles are found throughout NIN's catalog. Extreme [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] are staples of songs like "Wish" ({{audio-nohelp|Wish.ogg|sample}}) and "The Day the World Went Away" ({{audio-nohelp|TDtWWA.ogg|sample}}), which quickly change from quiet to loud and back again, ending with a loud climax followed by an abrupt stop (rather than by fading out or letting the final note resonate). Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. The band's music also has distinct rhythmic features, occasionally favoring odd [[time signatures]], abrupt time signature changes and jarring [[polyrhythm|cross-rhythms]] (examples of which can be found in songs like "La Mer", "March of the Pigs" and "The Collector").<ref name = "PopMatters" /><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050405/ai_n13498487 |title= Arts reviews: Nine Inch Nails |work= [[The Independent]] |date=[[2005-04-05]] |author= Nash, Rob |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}</ref>

On each album since ''Broken'', Reznor has included at least one piece built around an instrumental [[ostinato]]. These tracks tend to begin moderately quiet and slowly crescendo into a climax of noise and distortion; "Help Me I Am In Hell", "Eraser", "The Way Out Is Through", "Beside You in Time", and "The Greater Good", all of which are typically accompanied by a video segment when performed live, fit into this category. Similarly, some NIN albums contain a repeating [[Motif (music)|motif]] that reappears multiple times in different songs and contexts (either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony or in an altered tempo).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xrevw136.shtml |title= The Fragile |publisher= Lollipop Online |date= May 2000 |author= Marburger, Lex |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}</ref>

Reznor also has an affinity for [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] in his compositions, often created with chromatic melody and/or harmony. Perhaps the most famous use of this technique is in the song "Closer" ({{audio-nohelp|Closer.ogg|sample}}), where Reznor makes heavy use of [[mode mixture]]. He concludes the song with a [[chromatic]] piano motif, the same that recurs on the title track of ''The Downward Spiral''.<ref name = "PopMatters" /> "Hurt" ({{audio-nohelp|Hurt.ogg|sample}}), from the same album, features a highly dissonant [[tritone]] played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, which is emphasized when Reznor sings the [[eleventh]] on the word "I" every time the B/F [[Dyad (music)|dyad]] is played.<ref>{{cite book |author= Reynolds, Tom |title= I Hate Myself and I Want to Die |pages= 227 |id= ISBN 978-1860746284 |date= [[2005-06-13]] |publisher= Sanctuary Publishing}}</ref> In other cases, Reznor resorts to pure atonality, either by using oddly tuned instruments (as in tracks such as "Leaving Hope" and "[[The New Flesh]]") or literal noise in the song's arrangement ("Happiness in Slavery", "Mr. Self Destruct", "The Wretched", and nearly all of ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' being prime examples). Live performances usually conclude with the various whines and drones of [[Smashing guitars|guitars being destroyed]] by the band.

==Band members==
{{main|Nine Inch Nails live performances}}
It is generally understood that the Nine Inch Nails live band is a separate entity from the recording studio-based component of NIN.<ref name="Reimink" /> Occasionally, past band members are invited to participate in the process, but when not directly involved with recording new material, Nine Inch Nails' lineup tends to change drastically between major tours. Aside from Trent Reznor remaining on lead vocals and various instruments (mostly guitar), nothing about the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these personnel changes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=174 |title= Trent Reznor talks to Ian Camfield |publisher= [[Xfm London]] |date=[[2005-07-22]] |accessdate= 2006-10-24}}</ref> NIN's most recent incarnation features [[Aaron North]] on [[guitar]], [[Jeordie White]] on bass, [[Alessandro Cortini]] on keyboards, and [[Josh Freese]] on [[Drum kit|drums]], although Jeordie and Alessandro occasionally perform with different instruments. This lineup most recently toured Europe, Asia, Australia and America throughout 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/tour/index.html |title= Performance 2007 tour dates |date= [[2006-02-03]] |accessdate = 2006-02-07}}</ref>
