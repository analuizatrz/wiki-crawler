"'''The Bus Uncle'''" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 巴士阿叔) is a [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] [[video clip]] of an argument between an old man and a young bespectacled man aboard a bus in [[Hong Kong]] on [[April 27]], [[2006]]. The title was coined by members of an Internet forum in reference to the belligerent character in the video. Contrary to reports in Western media, the word "uncle" was never mentioned.

Its copious use of [[profanity]] and rhetorical outbursts attracted the attention of media around the world. Not only did the video become a cultural sensation in Hong Kong, it also inspired vigorous debate and discussion on lifestyle, etiquette and media ethics in the city.

==Incident==
:''For the full video transcript, see [[s:The Bus Uncle|The Bus Uncle]] at [[Wikisource]].''

The incident took place on a bus ([[Kowloon Motor Bus]] route 68X) en route to [[Yuen Long]] at approximately 11:00 p.m. on [[27 April]], [[2006]].<ref name=SCMP1>{{cite news

The man in front, Chan Yuet Tung reacted furiously and an argument ensued. The younger passenger, who seldom talked back during the quarrel, expressed reluctance to carry on the discussion. 

However, the middle-aged man angrily insisted that the matter was not settled. He ranted on, saying how angry he was when provoked under extreme stress. Throughout the second half of the video, the Bus Uncle insulted the young man repeatedly and appeared to be unapologetic about it. Despite the strong language and the Bus Uncle's threats of violence, a physical altercation never seemed imminent.

After Chan's identity was revealed, many journalists tried to interview him, but he demanded [[remuneration]] for press interviews<ref>{{cite news|title=The Bus Uncle requires a payment of at least HK$8000 for interviews (「最少八千」 巴士阿叔受訪要收錢 兩度報名參選特首 自稱身價5000萬)|publisher=[[Ming Pao]]|date=01-06-2006}}</ref>.

In [[Chinese culture]], it is common for a person to refer an older person as "阿叔", roughly translated as "Uncle". Therefore, the English title of the video is called "Bus Uncle".

[[Image:Bus Uncle B.jpg|right|thumb|The Bus Uncle's "victim", Elvis Ho Yui Hei in his office.]]

===Young man (Elvis Ho Yui Hei)===
The young man scolded on the video is Elvis Ho Yui Hei ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 何銳熙), a property agent for his family's property management company in [[Mong Kok]]. On [[May 23]], [[2006]], Ho (previously misidentified as "Alvin" or "Elvin") called a talk show on [[Commercial Radio]] claiming to be the young man involved in the argument. In a later interview with the [[South China Morning Post]], Ho said he often takes long bus rides home and would frequently ask passengers to lower their voices so he could take a nap. Despite having been threatened, Ho said he forgave "Bus Uncle" and sympathized with whatever stress the older man was suffering.<ref name=SCMP1/>

[[Image:Bus Uncle C.jpg|right|thumb|The person who recorded the Bus Uncle video, Jon Fong was interviewed by Hong Kong Cable TV News.]]

===Cameraman (Jon Fong Wing Hang)===
The man who recorded the video clip has been identified as Jon Fong Wing Hang ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 方穎恆), an accountant and part-time student, after he called a radio station on [[May 25]], [[2006]]. Fong, who recorded the incident with a [[Sony Ericsson]] [[Sony Ericsson W800|W800]]i mobile phone, claimed there was a second video yet to be posted online in which Ho fought back by making fun of "Bus Uncle" with a friend on the phone.  Fong also stated that the reason for the recording was to provide evidence to the police in case "Bus Uncle" became physically violent.<ref>{{cite news

==Aftermath==
Chan stated that when Ho tapped him on the shoulder, he was under duress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]] suicide-prevention hotline for support. However, Ho claimed that Chan was just chatting with friends.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bus Uncle sobs, "I want to commit suicide!"

Allegedly, Chan was quickly rejected and expelled by Ho, who expressed outrage towards the journalists who arranged the meeting and threatened legal action against the press.<ref name="Bus Uncle Bio"/>

Nevertheless, he was not charged with any of these offences. On [[June 7]], [[2006]], Chan, who had been hired by a restaurant as a Public Relations officer, was physically assaulted on-the-job in front of horrified diners by three unidentified masked men who then fled the scene.<ref name ="beaten"/> He sustained severe injuries to his eyes and face and was admitted to the emergency department for treatment. The restaurant owner Mr. Lee then faced pressure from his wife and daughter to fire Chan due to magazine coverage of Chan's exploits in a [[Shenzhen]] karaoke hostess-bar. Lee's initial refusal led to his wife's suicide attempt through drug overdose on [[June 11]] in order to force the issue.<ref>{{cite news|title=The "Steak Queen" attempts suicide through drug overdose to force the dismissal of the Bus Uncle (「扒后」林珍奇仰藥逼炒巴士阿叔)|publisher=[[Wen Wei Po]]|url=http://www.wenweipo.com/news.phtml?news_id=HK0606120009&loc=LU&cat=583BS&no_combo=1|accessdate=2007-04-21}} {{zh icon}}</ref> Having learnt of it, Chan resigned, saying he did not want Lee's family to be unhappy.

==Social impacts==
===International coverage===
The video clip, having been subtitled in English (in parts erroneously, though never straying too far from general tenor of the Cantonese), has penetrated Western media and been widely syndicated, and reported in prominent international journals in late May 2006, such as ''[[Channel NewsAsia]]'', ''[[CNN]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name="beaten"/><ref>{{cite news

[[Image:Pressureucb.jpg|right|thumb|Poster of an event by [[Capcom]], capitalizing on the tagline ''"I'm stressed! You're stressed"'' (我有壓力,你有壓力) adopted from the clip.]]
The famous quotes of Bus Uncle are now frequently used, mimicked, and parodied in Hong Kong, particularly by teenagers. A radio talk show host of Hong Kong Commercial Radio 1 and mentioned an incident involving his friend, a teacher and his students at the end of an examination. Once the time was up, a student yelled, "It's not settled! It's not settled! It's not settled!", refusing to stop writing. It was only when another teacher replied, "You may be stressed, but so am I." did the student agree to stop.<ref>{{cite episode

In June 2006, TVB television made a parody of the Bus Uncle video in its television promotion for its coverage of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] which featured TVB sports commentator Lam Sheung-Yee (林尚義), whose voice resembles Chan's, on a bus playing the role of the Bus Uncle. In the promotion, a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung-Yee (played by Lam Man Chung) questions whether Lam Sheung-Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup, which would be his last TV appearance before retirement. Turning around, Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasizes that the issue (i.e. the viewers' demand for World Cup coverage) has been resolved.  The passenger then offers to shake hands with Lam Sheung-Yee and calls for a truce.<ref>{{cite video

Furthermore, [[sitcom]]s of [[Asia Television Limited|ATV]] and TVB also imitated the video in argument scenes. In episode 67 of the TVB sitcom ''[[w:zh:高朋滿座|Welcome to the House]]'', the young bespecled main character tried to stop a man from talking too loudly on the mobile phone in the cinema. As a result, he was harshly rebuked by the man. Once his family knew about the incident from a video uploaded on the internet, they taught the character to be more assertive and not to allow himself to be bullied. In the end, he was able to stand up to the same man when they met again in the cinema and remove him from the premises.<ref>{{cite episode

===A closer look at life in Hong Kong===
Although many found the video humorous and entertaining, others warned that it hints at a more alarming and sinister prognosis of life in stress-filled Hong Kong. The fact that it was runner-up "Person of the Year" announced by [[Radio Television Hong Kong|RTHK]] indicated that it may have struck a chord with the general population.<ref>{{cite news

[[To Kit]], a well-known columnist, made a commentary about the incident on Commercial Radio. He described the behavior of Bus Uncle as "a noise raping" and said that the incident was the manifestation of underlying social tension as well as the mindset of a common Chinese person. He criticised Elvis' speechlessness as being too weak, likewise a stereotype of present-day Hong Kong youth. In addition, he noted that the incident implied that harmony in the neighborhood was somehow upset.<ref>{{cite episode

Dr. Lee Sing, director of the Hong Kong Mood Disorders Centre at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that Hong Kong's high-stress working environments are spawning a city-full of "Bus Uncles". Dr. Lee estimated that one out of every 50 grumpy Hong Kongers suffers from intermittent explosive disorder, turning one into a "ticking time bomb" of rage and violence.<ref>{{cite news

Dr. Ng Fung Sheung, a Social Science lecturer of the [[City University of Hong Kong]] explained that Hong Kong people tend to chat loudly in public places. She attributed this phenomenon to the television screens found in many vehicles and trains, which broadcast programs at high volumes. She suggested that the government should provide better civic education for the public to make them more considerate of others. When it comes to schools which banned the usage of catch phrases like "I'm stressed!", Dr. Ng stated that teachers must be able to distinguish whether the students really face pressure or are simply following the trend, and provide guidance if necessary.<ref>{{cite news

===Criticism of Hong Kong media ethics===
Nonetheless, others denied any social insights could be gleamed from the video clip, arguing that the frenzy was artificially created by sensationalist newspapers in order to boost circulation and profits. Media ethicists charged the media with making and not reporting news. Clement So York-kee, Director of the [[Journalism school|School of Journalism]] at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, warned that methods to uncover Bus Uncle news "did not seem to...[involve the] traditional practice of news reporting."<ref name=alongfor>{{cite news

  | date=2006-06-03 }}</ref> For example, several media outlets offered rewards on unmasking Uncle Bus' identity. In late May 2006, a group of journalists and photographers initiated and followed Chan's second meeting with Ho. After Ho's refusal, they brought Bus Uncle to a dinner and karaoke session. Although the session was widely reported, many believed it was artificially created news and unworthy of front-page attention.<ref>{{cite news
