He was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City in 1926 of [[Italian American]] heritage.  Prior to becoming an actor, Montana was a wrestler<ref>http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/l/lenny-montana.php</ref> and a [[mobster]]<ref>http://www.bartcop.com/806angel.htm</ref>. He also worked as a [[bouncer]] and doorman at several clubs in the 1950s.

His wrestling career started in the early 1950s. Montana came to the [[Tampa Bay]] area wrestling under a hood. The "Zebra Kid" as he was known, was an intimidating fellow, often pinning his opponents in under one minute. His classic battles with [[Eddie Graham]] sold out Fort Homer Hesterly Armory many Tuesday nights in the summer of 1961. Montana was a popular Wrestler and well known between other fighters. He won the [[NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship]] in October 1953. In October 1960, he and [[Don Stansauk|Hard Boiled Haggarty]] won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] but was unable to win it a second time as he broke his leg in a match against [[Verne Gagne]] and [[Leo Nomellini]] forcing Haggarty to choose a new partner. Montana also won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Georgia version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] in 1963 with [[Tarzan Tyler]].{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

Montana also wrestled under the names of Lenny 'The Bull', Len Crosby and "Chief Chewacki" in the 1950s and 1960s before turning to acting. 

His first film apperance was that of brutal mob Enforcer [[Luca Brasi]] in the 1972 classic [[The Godfather]]. Prior to being cast in the role of the fearsome Brasi, Montana was acting as a [[bodyguard]] for mobsters on the set of the film.<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1997/03/16/1997-03-16_in__the_godfather__we_trust_.html</ref> [[Al Ruddy]] picked out Montana<ref>http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903363-3,00.html</ref> for the part after the original actor playing the character died of a Stroke<ref>http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2006/03/27/news/national/4c88e582fc58a6b88725713e000749f0.txt</ref>. Montana was so nervous about appearing opposite [[Marlon Brando]]([[Vito Corleone]]) that he kept practicing his lines over and over again. [[Francis Ford Coppola]] recorded this and the scene featured in the film.<ref>http://www.nerve.com/CS/blogs/screengrab/archive/2008/09/26/that-guy-special-quot-godfather-quot-edition-part-five.aspx</ref> He had little screen time in the role of Luca Brasi, but caught the eye of producers and appeared in several television programs such as [[Contract on Cherry Street]] (1977) which featured [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Kojak]] (1978) and [[Magnum PI]] (1982). 

He also starred in a series of other movies.
