'''Charles Macartney''' (born [[June 27]], [[1886]], [[Maitland, New South Wales]]; died [[September 9]], [[1958]], [[Little Bay, New South Wales|Little Bay]], [[Sydney, New South Wales]]) was an [[Australian]] [[cricketer]] who played in 35 [[Test cricket|Tests]] between [[1907]] and [[1926]]. He was known as ''The Governor-General'' in reference to his authoritative batting. Macartney was a bowling all rounder when he made his Test debut in 1907, bowling [[left arm orthodox spin]] in addition to his batting. As his career progressed, he developed into a batsman, with his flair and strokeplay earning comparisons to close friend and role model [[Victor Trumper]], regarded as one of the finest stylists in cricket history. He was a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] in [[1922]], and in 1921 scored an Australian record score in England of 345 runs against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] at [[Trent Bridge]] in under four hours.

== Style ==

His flair was compared to that of [[Victor Trumper]], regarded as the most stylish batsman of the era, and his determination to that of [[Don Bradman]], universally regarded as the finest batmsman in cricket history.<ref name="az"/> His style was quite different to that of Trumper, but generated fascination with his daring and supreme confidence. He was described by Wisden as the being self-taught to a greater extent than anyone else in Australia or England in his era, calling him “a triumph to individualism…he is not a model to be copied” and ”one of the most brilliant and attractive right-handed batsmen in the history of Australian cricket”. His success was largely attributed to his eye, hand and foot.<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Wisden 1922 - Charles Macartney |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154728.html| year= [[1922]] |accessdate=2007-05-31| publisher=-[[Wisden]]}}</ref> Macartney was a short man, standing 160 cm. He had an unusual trait of attempting to leg glance [[yorker]]s pitched on middle stump down to fine leg, and often lost his wicket in this manner. He was known for preferring candid criticism from his teammates rather than praise.<ref name="az"/> In later life he condemned modern batsmen stating “I can't bear watching luscious half-volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers”, while explaining why he no longer watched cricket.<ref name="obit">{{cite web| title= Wisden 1959 - Obituary - Charles Macartney| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/155483.html| year= [[1959]] |accessdate=2007-05-31| publisher=-[[Wisden]]}}</ref> [[Jack Fingleton]] noted that he had a strategy of aiming a shot early in his innings straight at the bowler’s head, in order to rattle them and seize the psychological initiative.<ref name="az"/> 

He was known for his authorative combative style, and his élan and devastating strokemaking lead [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] cricketer [[Kenneth Hutchings]] to dub him the ‘’Governor-General’’.<ref name="az"/> In one Test in [[England]] in 1926, he reached his century before lunch on the first day and immediately called for a bat change. He selected the heaviest bat from the batch that his teammates brought out and then stated “Now I’m going to have a hit”.<ref name="pollard"/> He possessed powerful hands, strong forearms and broad shoulders. [[Leg spin]]ning team-mate [[Arthur Mailey]] recalled that Macartney would often hit him for [[six (cricket)|six]] in [[Sydney Grade Cricket]] matches. Grinning, he would say “Pitch one another one there and I’ll hit you for a few more”. On the occasions when he fell attempted further long hits, his grin would remain, saying “Wasn’t it good fun”.<ref name="pollard">{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=Jack|title=Cricket the Australian Way|year=1969|pages=192-193}}</ref> 

Macartney was also a [[left arm orthodox spin]]ner and bowled at a fast pace for a spinner, comparable to [[Derek Underwood]]. He was known for his consistent length and his well concealed faser ball which often guard batsmen off guard.<ref name="az"/> On sticky wickets, he was often incisive, taking 17 five wicket innings hauls in his career. He was known for his miserly attitude, often giving the impression that he would rather bowl ten consecutive maidens rather than take wickets and concede runs. This extended to his off-field activities, where he was considered careful and never wasteful with money. On the 1926 tour of England, he and Mailey visited a hat shop in [[London]]’s [[Piccadilly]] district which had a traditional of giving souvenir hats to cricketers of touring Australian squads. When asked if he would like a similar style to the gift he received in 1921, Macartney replied “Not on your life. I’ve been wearing this since you gave it to me in 1921.” <ref name="pollard"/>

In 1909, Australian team-mate [[Victor Trumper]] moved from [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], a suburb in Sydney’s south shore to Chatswood on the northern side of the harbour. Macartney and Trumper played together for Gordon and became close friends. Macartney regularly practised on the Trumper family’s backyard turf pitch. Trumper’s relocation made more frequent meetings possible, since the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] was not to open until 1932, and the only way of travelling between either side was by ferry. Trumper was regarded as the “crown prince of the golden age of cricket”, the finest and most stylish batsman of his era, and one of the most elegant strokemakers of all time. Under Trumper’s influence, Macartney became more audacious and adventurous. Macartney revered Trumper as a cricketer and as a person, and was a pall bearer when Trumper died aged 37 in 1915 from illness.<ref name="az"/>

== Early years ==
Macartney was taught to play cricket as a child by his maternal grandfather [[George Moore]], a slow round-arm bowler who had represented [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in three first-class matches against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]]. The equipment consisted of small handcrafted bat made from [[cedar]], and apples from the family orchard were used as balls. In his school career Macartney distinguished himself as an allrounder to [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra]] Superior and [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]] Public schools, before briefly attending [[Fort Street High School]]. It was during his school career that he was noticed by Australian captain [[Monty Noble]], who heaped praise on him in a newspaper article. After leaving school he worked for a produce merchant near the Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch break.<ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =178-179}}</ref>

Macartney joined [[North Sydney]] in 1902 and then moved to the [[Gordon, New South Wales|Gordon]] club in the outer northern suburbs when it was formed in the 1905-06 season. He played regularly for them until 19933-34 when he was 47, amassing 7648 runs at 547. He was known for his dominant status at the Chatswood Oval. In one match he lofted a ball out of the oval, over the railway line into an adjacent bowling green, forcing the lawn bowlers to take evasive action. In the same season, he made his first class debut against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]], making 56 in the first innings and taking three wickets in the second. He made his Test debut against England in the Fifth Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in 1907-08.<ref name="az"/>

== Pre-war Test career ==

He was selected for the 1909 tour of England, his first overseas tour. At this stage of his career, Macartney was regarded as a bowling [[all rounder]]. He was only eighth on the batting lists with an average of 19, but took 71 wickets at 17.46.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/>  His bowling confounded the English team in the Thrid Test at [[Headingley]] in [[Leeds]], where he took 7/58 in the first innings and 4/27 in the second. His best innings and match Test analysis helped secure the Test and retain the Ashes. His first Test century came against [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] in the Fifth Test in 1911, where he struck 137 and 56. It was his third century in as many first class innings.<ref name="az"/> He also made 119 and 126 in a state match against the tourists.<ref name="obit"/>

During the English tour of Australia in 1911-12 he only played in the fifth Test. Traveling in 1912 to England for the Triangular Tournament also including [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], he scored 2,207 runs during the tour, with an average of 45.<ref name="wisden"/> 

On the 1912 tour of England he reached the peak of his all round performance, totalling 2187 runs and 38 wickets for the tour.<ref name="az"/> He made six centuries, including 142 and 112 in one match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], but Wisden regarded the 99 in a drawn match Test at Lord's to be his finest of the tour.<ref name="wisden"/>  

During an unofficial tour of the Australian team to the [[United States]] in 1913 consisting of more than fifty games – Macartney scored 2,390 runs and took 189 wickets, topping both the batting and bowling averages.<ref name="wisden"/>

== Later career ==
[[World War I]] then interrupted Macartney's career as competitive cricket was cancelled. In January 1916, Macartney enlisted with the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian Infantry Force]] during the [[First World War]]. In July 1917 he was posted to [[France]] as a temporary warrant officer in the 3rd Division Artillery. In 1918 he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for gallantry. The death of his father later in the year caused his premature repatriation and prevented his appearance with the Australian Services team.<ref name="az"/>

Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920-21. He recorded his highest Test innings was 170 against England at Sydney in the series. He headed the Australian Test averages with 86.66 that season, as Australia took the only Ashes clean sweep until 2006-07.<ref name="obit"/>

On the 1921 Ashes tour of England, he scored 345 against Nottinghamshire at [[Trent Bridge]] in 223 minutes, with 51 boundaries. After reaching his century, he called for a heavier bat. This still stands as the highest innings put together by an Australian in England and, furthermore, no other batsman in first-class cricket has scored as many runs in a single day.<ref name="obit"/> He headed both the batting aggregates and averages with 2317 at 59.41.<ref name="az"/> He was named as one of the 1922 [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]], who stated that he was “by many degrees the most brilliant and individual Australian batsman of the present day”.<ref name="wisden"/>

During the 1926 Ashes, tour he became the second Australian to score a century before lunch on the opening day of a Test, in the Third Test at [[Headingley]]. Macartney was dropped when on two, and went on to be 112 at lunch before finishing with 151. It was part of a hat-trick of Test centuries during the tour, after scoring an unbeaten 133 in the Second Test at [[Lord’s]] and 109 in the Fourth Test at [[Old Trafford]].<ref name="az"/> His average was 94.60 for the tour. Macartney retired from Tests after the tour. He took part in twelve Test century partnerships, the largest being  235 with [[Bill Woodfull]] against England at Leeds when he made the century before lunch.<ref name="obit"/>

In 1935-36 he was vice captain of Tarrant’s side that toured India in 1935-36, and wrote forthright columns for [[The Hindu]]. Neville Cardus wrote that “there was always chivalry in his cricket, a prancing sort of heroism. The dauntlessness of his play, the brave beauty and the original skill bring tears to my eyes yet.”<ref name="az"/>
