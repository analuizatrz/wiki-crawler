==History==
===Antiquity===
[[Image:Almog IL5 Yodfat.jpg|250px|thumb|The hilltop where the fortress stood during the [[Great Revolt]].]]
In 67 CE, Yodfat was the site of a fierce battle described by [[Josephus Flavius]], the commander of the Galilee in the [[Great Revolt]], in his later chronicle of the Jewish wars against the Romans.  The city was guarded by a hilltop fortress accessible only from the north.  [[Vespasian]] pitched his camp on the northern side of the city and held it under siege for 47 days. Vespasian was wounded in the battle. 40,000 Jews were killed and 1,000 women and children were sold into slavery. The city was razed and burned on the first of the Hebrew month of [[Tammuz]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia
