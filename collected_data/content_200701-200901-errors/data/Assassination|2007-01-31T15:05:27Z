{{redirect2|Assassin|Targeted killing}}
'''Assassination''' is the [[murder]] of an important person, usually a political figure or other strategically important individual. An assassin or the assassin's employer usually has an [[ideology|ideological]] or [[politics|political]] agenda, and regards the target as an obstacle to furthering his agenda.  Other motivations may be [[money]], as in the case of a [[contract killing]], revenge, or acts of [[espionage]] at the request of a [[government]]. 

Some governments use the [[Euphemism#Doublespeak|euphemism]] '''targeted killing''' for sanctioned assassinations of opponents. ''Assassination'' itself, along with terms such as ''[[terrorism|terrorist]]'' and ''[[freedom fighter]]'', is often considered to be a [[loaded (language)|loaded term]].

==Etymology==

{{Main|Hashshashin}}

The term 'Assassin' is thought to be derived from its connections to the Hashshashin, a militant religious sect of [[Ismaili]] Muslims, thought to be active in the Middle East in the 8th to 14th centuries. This mystic [[secret society]] killed members of the [[Abbasid]] elite for political or religious motivations. 

It was said that they were drugged during their murders, often with materials such as [[hashish]]. The name ''assassin'' is derived from either ''hasishin'' for the supposed influence of the drugs, and disregard for their own lives in the process, or ''hassansin'' for their leader, [[Hassan-i-Sabah]]. The above however relies heavily on second-hand information from crusader-authored histories which have been traditionally very unreliable for information about native cultures.

Today, it is known that ''hashishinnya'' was an offensive term used to depict this cult by its Muslim and Mongolian detractors; the extreme zeal and cold preparation to murder makes it unlikely they ever used drugs. As far as is known they only used daggers, rarely survived their attacks, even when successful (unlike in many tales, where they are silent, invisible killers) and it seems that they rarely acted against westerners during the Crusades, partly because the crusading orders were not as affected by losing individual leaders as were the autocratic local regimes of the time.<ref>''[http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,555621,00.html Passports to paradise]'' - review of the reissue of ''The Assassins'' by [[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]] in [[The Guardian]], Saturday 22 September 2001</ref>

This form of murder was made popular by the rap sensation Konvix of Pleasant Plains, IL.

==Definition problems==

According to ''The [[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', to assassinate is:

:''"...to [[murder]] (a prominent person) by surprise attack, as for political reasons."''<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=assassination Assassination] (from the [[American Heritage Dictionary]])</ref>

Unlike some topics, such as terrorism, wherein there is a substantial [[grey area]] and often bitter controversy between which specific instances qualify or even what standards should be used, the "[[common sense]]" classification of assassination stated at the outset of this article seems to stand with few objections. 

There are however a few problems regarding motivation - for instance, as to whether a murder should be considered an assassination only if the victim is a political leader or public figure hostile to the agenda of the killer, or whether the term should also include killings where the primary motivation is to attract attention to a cause or for purely personal reasons, with the target itself being of secondary importance. 

[[Image:King Alexander assasination corected aspect contract and sharpness.gif|thumb|250px|Aftermath of the assassination of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].]]
[[Image:Death of Inejiro Asanuma.jpg|right|250px|thumbnail|Assassination of Japanese politician [[Inejiro Asanuma]], caught on camera.]]

Notable instances in which this definitional problem has come into effect include the attempt on the life of [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] by [[John Hinckley]], who was determined subsequently to have serious psychological problems and publicly stated his intent was to get the attention of actress [[Jodie Foster]] rather than make any political statement. The killing of former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[John Lennon]] posed a similar problem — despite Lennon's outspokenness on many liberal political issues, his killer does not seem to have been more than an unstable [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]]. The use of the term "assassination" to describe Lennon's murder is a matter of some additional debate, since Lennon was primarily an entertainer, not a political figure, and it could be argued that describing his killing as an assassination is no more appropriate than, for example, using the term to describe the murders of singers [[Selena Quintanilla]] or [[Marvin Gaye]]. The issue is further complicated by the fact that although Lennon was likely as outspoken politically as Reagan (and certainly as famous), Reagan was an elected official at the time, possibly requiring different criteria for Lennon's case.
 
One can take one of three positions (note that this consideration is of necessity based upon language, not law): 

*that the killing of someone ''only for political, moral, or ideological reasons'' constitutes an assassination (hence neither Reagan nor Lennon were the victims of assassins' attacks, while Ford was), 

*that the killing of someone ''serving in politics or public office'' counts (thus Reagan's and Ford's attackers were would-be assassins, while Lennon's killer was not), 

*or that anyone ''with a significant level of political involvement'' would be an assassination victim in the event of their murder (in which case all three instances would be assassinations or attempts).

For the purposes of this article, the first, most conservative definition predominates, even though it is likely that the second is the most popular. The third is generally considered to be too general in application.

== Use in history ==

{{Main|History of assassination}}

=== Ancient history ===

Some would argue that assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]], dating back to the earliest governments of the world. It gained special importance where societies moved beyond a point where direct military force to gain power or remove an opponent became considered too crude.

[[Philip II of Macedon]], the father of [[Alexander the Great]], as well as Gaius [[Julius Caesar]] can be noted as famous examples. [[Emperors of Rome]] often met  their end in this way, as did many of the [[Shia Imam]]s. The practice was also well-known in [[History of China|ancient China]] like [[Jing Ke]]'s failed assassination of [[Qin Shi Huang]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was extremely rare, but with the [[Renaissance]] the idea of ''tyrannomachy'' (the killing of a King when his rule becomes tyrannical) re-emerged and gained recognition. Rulers like [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] of France fell to it.

[[Image:Lincolnassassination.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|Artist's depiction of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865. Lincoln and assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]] on the right.]]

=== Modern history ===

As the world moved into the present day and the stakes in political clashes of will continued to grow to a global scale, the number of assassinations concurrently multiplied. In [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] alone, five emperors were assassinated within less than 200 years - [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

In the [[United States of America|USA]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[James Garfield]], [[William McKinley]], and [[John F. Kennedy]] died at the hands of assassins, while many other presidents survived attempts on their life. Most of these assassinations however turned out to have no more than nebulous political backgrounds, adding a new threat - the mentally deranged assassin.

In [[Europe]] the assassination of [[Archduke]] [[Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] by Serb nationalist insurgents finally triggered [[World War I]] after a period of building conflicts, while [[World War II]] saw the first known use of specifically trained assassination operatives since the original ''Assassins''. [[Reinhard Heydrich]] was killed by British-backed killers, and knowledge from decoded transmissions allowed the US to carry out a targeted attack, killing  Japanese Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] while he was en-route in an airplane. Adolf Hitler meanwhile was almost [[July 20 Plot|killed by his own officers]], and survived numerous attempts by other individuals and organizations.

[[Image:Shot Dead on Arrival.JPG|left|280px|thumb|Senator [[Ninoy Aquino]], murdered by a bodyguard of [[Philippines|Phillipine]] President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].]] 

=== Cold War and beyond===

The [[Cold War]] saw a dramatic increase in the number of political assassinations, likely due in large part to the [[ideology|ideological]] polarization of most of the [[first world|First]] and [[Second world]]s, whose adherents were more than willing to both justify and finance such killings. 

During the Kennedy era [[Fidel Castro]] narrowly escaped death on several occasions at the hands of the CIA, some allege that [[Salvador Allende]] of [[Chile]] was another - successful - example of such US tactics. At the same time, the [[KGB]] made creative use of assassination to deal with high-profile defectors and [[Israel]]'s [[Mossad]] used them to eliminate [[Palestinian]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] and politicians.

Most major powers were not long in repudiating Cold War assassination tactics, though many allege that this was merely a smoke screen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with Russia, Israel and other nations accused of still regularly engaging in such operations. 

In 1986, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered the [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] air raid on Libya where one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler [[Muammar al-Gaddafi | Muammar Gaddafi]]. Gaddafi escaped unharmed, however his adopted daughter [[Bombing of Libya (April 1986)#Casualties |Hanna]] was one of the civilian casualties.

During the [[1991 Gulf War]], the United States also struck many of Iraq’s most important command bunkers with [[bunker buster|bunker-busting bombs]] in hopes of killing Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]]. 

Since the rise of [[al-Qaeda]] and similar organizations, who themselves often engage in assassination tactics, both the US administrations of [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush|Bush]] have backed 'targeted killings', mostly directed against terrorist leaders like [[Osama bin Laden]] and opponents like [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]]. Most of these attempts were undertaken with remote-controlled missiles and similar tactics, often using remote surveillance for the decision where and when to strike as well. One of the most well-known examples of War on Terrorism assassinations carried out by the United States was the killing of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] and Sheik Abd-Al-Rahman, both as a result of two guided bombs on a safehouse outside of Baghdad.

==Further reasons==

===As military doctrine===

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused - [[Sun Tzu]] argued for such in ''[[The Art of War]]'', as did [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] in ''[[The Prince]]''. In medieval times, an army and even a nation might be based upon and around a particularly strong, canny or charismatic leader, whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war. However, in modern warfare a soldier's mindset is generally considered to surround ideals far more than specific leaders, while command structures are more flexible in replacing officer losses. While the death of a popular or successful leader often has a detrimental effect on morale, the organisational system and the belief in a specific cause is usually strong enough to enable continued warfare. 

There is also the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will "[[martyr]]" a leader and support his cause (by showing the moral ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. There are a number of additional examples from [[World War II]], the last major [[total war]], which show how assassination was used as a military tool both tactical and strategic levels: 

*The American interception of [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]] airplane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.

*The American perception that [[Otto Skorzeny|Skorzeny's]] [[commando]]s were planning to assassinate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] played havoc with Eisenhowers personal plans for some time, though it did not affect the battle itself. Skorzeny later denied in an interview with the ''New York Times''{{fact}} that he had ever intended to assassinate Eisenhower during [[Operation Greif]] and could prove it.<ref name="Skor">''Commando Extraordinary'' - Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155</ref> 

*There is also mention<ref name="Skor"/> of a planned British commando raid to capture German General [[Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel]] (also known as "The Desert Fox"), which might have had strategic effects in removing one of the most skilled Axis commanders. 

*The British in turn decided not to try to assassinate Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], head of the [[Abwehr]] (''German military intelligence''), because to do so was considered risking to actually improve the service.{{fact}}

Many have claimed that a successful assassination of [[Osama Bin Laden]] might have prevented the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]] attacks. Israel uses targeted killings both for vengeance purposes and to paralyze the terrorist activities of its opponents, in a similar style as Russia has done during the wars in [[Chechenya]].

===As tool of insurgents===

Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes.

The [[Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919-1921 assassinated many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit - [[Twelve Apostles (Irish counter-intelligence organisation)|the Squad]] - for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the assassination of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920. 

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] (1969-present). Assassination of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] separatists [[ETA]] in [[Spain]] have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them, meaning that many needed armed police bodyguards. 

The [[Red Brigades]] in [[Italy]] carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in [[Germany]] in the 1970s and 1980s.

[[Middle East]]ern groups, such as the [[PLO]] and [[Hezbollah]], have all engaged in assassinations, though the higher intensity of armed conflict in the region compared to western Europe means that many of their actions are either better characterized as [[guerrilla]] operations or as random attacks on civilians - especially the technique of [[suicide bomb]]s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], assassinations were routinely carried out by communist insurgents against government officials and private individuals deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Diem]] regime to collapse, prior to the US intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' - Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday 16 December 1970</ref> Later in the war, the [[United States of America|USA]] engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and symphatizers.

===For money===

Individually, too, people have often found reasons to arrange the deaths of others through paid intermediaries. One who kills with no political motive or group loyalty who kills ''only'' for money is known as a hitman or contract killer. Note that by the definition accepted above, while such a killer is not, strictly speaking, an assassin, if the killing is ordered and financed towards a political end, then that killing must rightly be termed an assassination, and the hitman an assassin by extension.

Entire organizations have sometimes specialized in assassination as one of their services, to be gained for the right price. Besides the original [[hashshashin]], the [[ninja]] clans of [[Japan]] were rumored to perform assassinations - though it can be pointed out that most of what was ever known about the ninja was [[rumor]] and [[hearsay]]. 

In the [[United States]], [[Murder, Inc.]], an organization partnered to the [[Mafia]], was formed for the sole purpose of performing assassinations for organized crime. In [[Russia]], the ''vory'' (thieves), their version of the Mafia, are often known to provide assassinations for the right price, as well as engaging in it themselves for their own purposes. A professional hitman is called "cleaner" in Russia; he is used to clean away the target. The Finnish underworld uses the word "[[torpedo]]" for a contract killer.

==Psychology==

{{section-stub}}

A major study about assassination attempts in the US in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.<ref name="SS"/>

However about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be delusional, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers'. The report also found that around 2/3rds had previously been arrested for (not necessarily related) offenses, that around 44% had a history of serious depression, and 39% a history of substance abuse.<ref name="SS"/>

==Techniques==

===Ancient methods===

It seems certain that the first assassinations would have been direct and simple: [[stabbing]], [[strangle|strangling]] or [[bludgeon|bludgeoning]]. Is seems unlikely that substantial planning would have been involved, as the tribal groups were too small, and the connection to the leaders too close. As [[civilization]] took root, however, leaders began to have greater importance, and become more detached from the groups they ruled. This would have bought planning, [[subterfuge]] and weapons into successful assassination plans.

The key technique was likely [[infiltration]], with the actual assassination via stabbing, smothering or strangulation. [[Poison]]s also started to be used in many forms. [[Death cap]] mushrooms and similar plants became a traditional choice of assassins{{citation needed}} especially if they could not be perceived as poisonous by taste, and the symptoms of the poisoning did not show until after some time.

===Modern methods===

With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. Bodyguards were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question; it could be done from a great distance in a crowded square or even at a church, as with the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]], for example. Additionally the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances for survival of an assassin. 

[[Image:Sadat6.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Egypt]]ian president [[Sadat]], assassinated by a group using [[assault rifles]] and [[hand grenade|grenades]].]]

[[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch; for an example, the [[Gunpowder Plot]] could have 'assassinated' almost a thousand people.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine|landmines]] also used, especially in the [[Middle East]] and Balkans (the initial attempt on Archduke Franz Ferdinand's life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG) has became a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles for assassination<ref>''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' - [[CNN]], Saturday 17 April 2004</ref>, as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

The [[sniper rifle]] is often used in fictional assassinations. However, sniper rifles are difficult to obtain, train with, conspicuous in size and therefore difficult to conceal and transport. Ownership or use during an assassination also attracts special attention of [[police]] and [[government]] authorities. Despite their comparative disadvantages, easy-to-acquire and hard-to-trace [[handgun]]s are much more commonly used. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the US in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, while 15% of the attempts used knives and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<ref name="SS"/>

Assassination can also be concealed through their means, where the target is killed in such a way that investigations are likely to conclude an accidental death - for example slipping and drowning in a bathtub. Assassination can also imitate suicide, for example by placing the handgun used for the murder on the corpse - though this has been made much more complicated by modern ballistic science and other forensic techniques. Pushing someone from a great height also makes a murder hard to detect, though such an act would again require subterfuge to manipulate the person (without witnesses) into a correct situation, and is thus rarely used for assassination, as opposed to other forms of murder.

A recent case in the UK concerned the [[assassination of Alexander Litvinenko]] who was given a lethal dose of radioactive [[polonium]]-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food. Litvinenko, a former Soviet spy, was granted asylum in the UK in 2000 after complaining of persecution in [[Russia]], and shortly before his death he issued a statement accusing [[Vladimir Putin]], the Russian president, of involvement in the assassination plot. President Putin denied any involvement.{{fact}}

===Local preferences===

It is interesting to note that even as more modern methods of killing become available, older ones are still encountered; indeed, in nations like [[India]] killings by knife or [[sword]] remain quite popular, as they do in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (for example, with the [[machete]]). In fact, since the development of firearms each region of the world seems to have its preferred methods of contract murder; besides those mentioned, explosives are quite popular in not only the Middle East but in most of Europe as well, save [[Northern Europe]] where shootings are more common; and in the Americas assassinations are almost exclusively performed by gunshot.{{fact}}

==Counter-measures==

===Early forms===

One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins is without doubt the [[bodyguard]]. He acts as a shield for the potential target, keeps lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a planned tour), and is literally supposed to put himself 'in harms way' - both by his simple presence, forming a barrier in front of the target<ref name="SS">''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study of Recent Assassins, Attackers, and Near Lethal Approachers]'' - Fein, Robert A. & Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999</ref><ref>[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] - Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> and by shielding the target during any attack. He is is also, if possible, to neutralize an attacker as fast as possible, and thus often carries weapons (where legal or possible). 

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading to attempts via [[subterfuge]], such as poison (which was answered by the [[food taster]]).

Notable examples of bodyguards would include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]] - although, in both cases, it should be noted that the protectors often became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage at their whim or eliminating threatening leaders altogether. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties leads to assassinations such as that of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodguards in 1984.

===Modern strategies===

With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a [[brigade|small army]] trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence of assassins and their capabilities skyrocketed, and so did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[armored car]]s or [[armored limousine]]s were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions rendering them virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire and smaller bombs and [[mine]]s. <ref>''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars]'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)</ref> [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, though they were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected - as such they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restrictive;<ref name="Report">[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] - Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks  before being granted access to the official in question, and as [[communication]] became better and [[information technology]] more prevalent, it has become next-to-impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detector]]s. 

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during [[transport]], both due to weaker security and security lapses, such as with US [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Patrice Lumumba]] and possibly also [[Salvador Allende]].

The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] (built following an extremist's attempt at his life). Politicians themselves often resent this need for separation - which has at times caused tragedy when they sent their bodyguards from their side for personal or publicity reasons, as US President [[William McKinley]] did during the public reception at which he was assassinated.<ref name="Report"/>

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as [[writer]] [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], a person built similar to the person he is expected to impersonate. These persons are then made up, as well as in some cases [[surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations. Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein are known to have used body doubles, while [[Fidel Castro]] is believed to have used them.<ref>''[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html It's Bin Laden ... or Is It?]'' - [[Fox News]], Thursday 20 December 2001</ref>

In the final analysis, counter-measures can never be fully effective. If the assassin is committed beyond reason (i.e. [[insanity|insane]]) or without concern for his own for self-preservation ([[suicide attack]]er), then the task of protecting a person will be made much more difficult.
