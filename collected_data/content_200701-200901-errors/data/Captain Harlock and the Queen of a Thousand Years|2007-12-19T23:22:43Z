'''''Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years''''' is an [[animated]] [[science fiction]] [[television series]] produced by [[Harmony Gold USA]]. The series was created by [[Carl Macek]] by combining footage from [[Leiji Matsumoto]]'s ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' and ''[[Queen Millennia]]'' ''[[anime]]'' series.

The plot of Macek's creation has no relation to Matsumoto's works.

== Plot ==
''Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years'' takes place in the year 2976, after humankind has colonized the distant stars. But prosperity has corrupted the people of Earth, becoming corrupt and decadent.

The Mazone, a race of [[Sentience|sentient]] plants, hatch a plot to seize Earth after their own planet becomes uninhabitable. A lone scientist tries to warn the people of Earth, but at the cost of his reputation and life. The titular Harlock is framed for the murder and finds himself on the run from Earth authorities. Now an outcast, Harlock plans to stop the Mazone and save humanity from the alien threat with aid from Captain Millennia.

== Production ==
After the success of ''Robotech'', Harmony Gold sought to expand their [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television production in other animation series originating in [[Japan]]. Carl Macek, producer of ''Robotech'', was asked what other ''anime'' series he was interested in dubbing. Macek expressed an interest in Leiji Matsumoto's ''Captain Harlock''.

After the rights were obtained, Macek was informed Harmony Gold had allocated airtime for 65 episodes. ''Captain Harlock'', however, was 42 episodes long, prompting Harmony Gold to buy another Matsumoto series, ''Queen Millennia''. It then fell to Macek and his team to combine the two shows into one series.

Unlike ''Robotech'', it was decided to combine the two series simultaneously instead of simply running them one after the other with some "connecting" episodes. At the same time, it was also decided to change the timing of episodes, thus creating a situation where clips from episodes at various points in the original series would appear in a single episode in the American series. This resulted in a wildly different plot from both of the original sources. Also, despite title of the series, the two titular characters never appeared together onscreen.
