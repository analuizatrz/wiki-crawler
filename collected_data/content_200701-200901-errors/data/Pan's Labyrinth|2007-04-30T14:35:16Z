==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
The prologue tells of Princess Moanna, daughter to the king of the underworld. She became curious about the world above and fled to the surface, where the brightness of the sun blotted out her memories. Eventually growing old as a human, she died, causing turmoil in her kingdom. However, the king always believed that her spirit would one day return, [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] in the form of another.

The story cuts to post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] [[Spain]] in [[1944]], after [[Francisco Franco]] has come into power. Ofelia, a young girl often absorbed in [[fairy tales]], travels with her pregnant mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather and father of Carmen's unborn child. Vidal, a [[fascist]] devotee, suffers from the repercussions of his father's death as a famed commander in [[Morocco]], and takes his feelings out on the Republican rebels he has been assigned to seek out and eliminate while stationed at a countryside mill.

On the way, Ofelia discovers a large insect resembling a [[praying mantis]] and [[walking stick bug]], and she believes it to be a [[fairy]]. The creature follows the family to their new home, where it leads Ofelia to an ancient [[labyrinth]]. Before Ofelia can enter the labyrinth, she is stopped by Mercedes, one of Vidal's maids and a [[spy]] for the rebels, who are led by her brother, Pedro. That night, the creature appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it morphs into a fairy and leads Ofelia through the labyrinth into a small clearing. There, she meets the [[faun]], who recognizes her as the long-lost Princess Moanna and assigns her three tasks to complete before the full moon to ensure that her "essence is intact".
[[Image:Panslabyrinthofelia.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The faun gives Ofelia the Book of Crossroads, which explains her tasks.]]
Ofelia completes the first task - retrieving a key from the belly of a giant [[toad]] - however, she fears for her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a [[Mandrake (plant)|mandrake]] root, which instantly begins to cure her mother's illness. Ofelia then manages to complete the second task - taking an ornate [[dagger]] from the lair of the Pale Man. Although she was warned to not consume anything there, she eats two of the Pale Man's grapes as she leaves, awakening him and causing the deaths of two of the faun's fairies. Infuriated by her disobeying his orders, the faun disappears, claiming that she will never return to her kingdom or see him again.

Meanwhile, Vidal becomes increasingly vicious in his methods, torturing a captured Republican and killing a doctor (a Republican sympathizer) who [[euthanized]] the prisoner (at the prisoner's request) after the prisoner began to give Vidal information. Vidal catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, and Carmen, desperate to prove to her daughter that magic is not real, throws the root into the fireplace. Instantly, she develops painful [[contraction (childbirth)|contractions]] and dies giving birth to a son. Vidal discovers Mercedes is a rebel spy, and he captures her and Ofelia as they attempt to escape. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, and Mercedes is taken to be tortured; however, she frees herself, injures Vidal and flees into the woods, where Pedro and the rebels rescue her.

The faun returns to Ofelia, claiming that he will give her one more chance to prove herself. He tells her to take her baby brother into the labyrinth. Ofelia manages to steal the baby after sedating Vidal; however, although disoriented, Vidal continues to chase her through the labyrinth amidst an attack on the mill by the rebels. Upon her arrival in the clearing, the faun demands that Ofelia spill her brother's blood to open the portal to the underworld. Ofelia refuses to harm her brother, and the faun disappears, accepting her decision. Vidal finds her, takes the baby and shoots Ofelia. As he staggers out of the labyrinth, he finds the rebels waiting for him and, after handing them his son, is killed by Pedro.

As Mercedes enters the labyrinth and mourns over Ofelia's dead body, Ofelia is reunited with the king and queen of the underworld. She learns that by spilling her own blood instead of her brother's, she has proven herself to be the true Princess Moanna. The epilogue tells that Ofelia ruled the kingdom for many centuries, was adored by her people, and left behind little signs of her life on Earth, visible only to those who knew where to look.

==Cast==
[[Image:Ivana Baquero in Pan's Labyrinth.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ivana Baquero with one of the magical characters]]
*'''[[Ivana Baquero]]''' as '''Ofelia''': Del Toro says he was "scared shitless" in [[casting]] the right actress for the lead role, and that finding the 11-year old Spanish actress was purely accidental. "The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9 and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age."<ref name="DH">{{cite news |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php|title=Exclusive Interview: Guillermo del Toro "Pan's Labyrinth" |accessdate=2007-01-28|date=[[2006-09-26]] |publisher=Dark Horizons |last=Fischer|first=Paul}}</ref> Baquero says that del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairytales to help her "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt." She says she thought the film was "marvelous," and that "At the same time it can bring you pain and sadness and scariness and happiness."<ref name="SF">{{cite news |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html|title=Guillermo del Toro and Ivana Baquero escape from a civil war into the fairytale land of ''Pan's Labyrinth''  |accessdate=2007-01-27|date=[[2006-12-25]] |publisher=[[Science Fiction Weekly]]|last=Spelling|first=Ian}}</ref>
*'''[[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]''' as '''The Faun''' and '''The Pale Man''': Jones had worked with del Toro before on ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' and ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'', and says the director sent him an email saying "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you". Jones read an English translation of the script and was enthusiastic but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was "terrified" and del Toro suggested using a voice over actor to dub over him later, or learning Spanish phonetically, but Jones rejected both ideas preferring to learn it himself. He said "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi right before I even went in," using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up to practice the words.<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/6216|title=Doug Jones En Espanol |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2006-12-27]] |publisher=CanMag|last=Topel|first=Fred}}</ref> Del Toro decided afterwards that he still preferred to dub Jones with the voice of "an authoritative theatre actor," but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to easily match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements.<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.straight.com/node/63731 |title= Labyrinth’s faun unmasked |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=[[2007-01-11]] |publisher=straight.com |last=Eisner|first=Ken}}</ref>
*'''[[Sergi López (actor)|Sergi López]]''' as '''Captain Vidal''': Del Toro met with López in [[Barcelona]], a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. López said of it, "For two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written.'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he's said that "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6255-sergi-lopez-pans-labyrinth-interview |title=Sergi Lopez on ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-02]]|publisher=CanMag| last=Topel |first=Fred}}</ref> In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told del Toro "You should be very careful because you don’t know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied "Well, it’s not that I don't know, it's that I don't care."<ref name="oscarwatch">{{cite news |url=http://www.oscarwatch.com/2007/01/pans_labyrinth_a_story_that.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth: A Story that Needed Guillermo Del Toro |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-11]]|publisher=oscarwatch.com| last=Stone|first=Sasha}}</ref>
*'''[[Ariadna Gil]]''' as '''Carmen'''
*'''[[Maribel Verdú]]''' as '''Mercedes''': Like López, Verdú was cast against type; usually playing a sex goddess, del Toro selected her to play the compassionate revolutionary because he "saw a sadness in her...he thought would be perfect for the part".<ref name="oscarwatch"/>
*'''Alex Angulo''' as '''Doctor Ferreiro'''
*'''Roger Casamajor''' as '''Pedro'''
*'''César Vea''' as '''Serrano'''

[[Mark Kermode]], in ''[[The Observer]]'', labelled ''Pan's Labyrinth'' as the best film of 2006, describing it as "an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1939681,00.html|title=Pain should not be sought - but it should never be avoided|accessdate=2007-01-25|date=[[2006-11-05]] |publisher=[[The Observer]]|last=Kermode|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Kermode}}</ref> Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film "works on so many levels that it seems to change shape even as you watch it",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2006/10/13/pans_labyrinth/|title=Pan's Labyrinth|accessdate=2007-01-25|date=[[2006-10-13]] |publisher=[[Salon.com]]|last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie}}</ref> and Jim Emerson called the film "a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061228/REVIEWS/61228001/1023|title=Pan's Labyrinth |accessdate=2007-01-25|date=[[2006-12-29]] |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |last=Emerson|first=Jim}}</ref> [[The New Yorker]]'s Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it "discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small, supercharged noises: the creak of the Captain's leather gloves ... the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter..."<ref>Anthony Lane, "The Current Cinema", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', January 08, 2007</ref>

Many critics viewed this downfall as leading to an underappreciation of the film as the audience who would enjoy the film may have been put off my the advertising campaign.

During its limited first three weeks at the United States [[box office]], the film made [[US$]]5,430,000. As of [[March 1]], [[2007]], it has grossed $33 million in North America, and grossed around $70 million worldwide.<ref name="bom"/> At the Cannes Film Festival, it received a 22-minute standing ovation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2003522640_deltoro16.html|title=Director keeps Hollywood out of "Pan's Labyrinth"|accessdate=2007-01-25|date=[[2007-01-16]] |publisher=[[The Miami Herald]] |last=Rodriguez|first=Rene}}</ref>

==Influences==
Del Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there.<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.fr/films/fiche_film.php?langue=6002&id_film=4359827#news ''Pan's Labyrinth'' in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival]</ref> In 2004, del Toro said: "Pan is an original story. Some of my favorite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling (remember the labyrinth image on ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]''?) and I am trying to mix them and play with them." However, in 2007, del Toro admitted to the striking similarities between his film and [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia|Chronicles of Narnia]]'': both films have similar child-age principal characters, mythic creatures (particularly the fauns), and themes of "disobedience and choice."  Says del Toro: "This is my version of that universe, not only 'Narnia,' but that universe of children's literature."<ref name=del-toro-narnia>{{cite news|url=http://www.starbeacon.com/heat/local_story_363121523|title=Del Toro crafts a harrowing fairy tale|accessdate=2007-03-28|date=[[2006-12-29]] |publisher=[[Star Beacon]]}}</ref>  In fact, del Toro was asked to direct ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' but turned it down for ''Pan's Labyrinth.''<ref name=del-toro-narnia/>  Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''Labyrinths'', [[Arthur Machen|Arthur Machen's]] ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' and ''[[The White People]]'', [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany's]] ''The Blessing of Pan'', [[Algernon Blackwood|Algernon Blackwood's]] ''Pan's Garden'' and [[Francisco Goya|Francisco Goya's]] works.<ref>[http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=&sid=2e4cd823ac827248f20a4820065589d2 Del Toro message board]</ref> The movie also borrows from themes popular in Spanish and Mexican culture and literature, including loss of innocence and the idea of magic existing as long as you believe.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

===Comparison to other films===
In addition to ''Narnia'', ''Pan's Labyrinth'' has also been compared to films such as [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]'', [[Gabor Csupo]]'s ''[[Bridge to Terabithia (2007 film)|Bridge to Terabithia]]'' and [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/83674.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth Film Review - Time Out Film |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6778-bridge-terabithia-review | title=Bridge to Terabithia a Pan's Labyrinth for Kids |accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> Del Toro himself has noted similarities with ''[[The Spirit of the Beehive]]''.<ref name=outsidetheframe>{{cite web|url=http://www.thephoenix.com/OutsideTheFrame/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8ae649e6-a17f-478b-993a-a6f0f791a936 |title=Outside The Frame: Guillermo Del Toro Interview Part 1 |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=2007-01-11 |publisher=ThePhoenix.com}}</ref>
