'''''Casino Royale''''' is the 21st [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]] and the first to star [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. Based on the [[1953 in literature|1953]] novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' by [[Ian Fleming]], it was adapted by screenwriters [[Neal Purvis]], [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]], and [[Paul Haggis]] and directed by [[Martin Campbell]]. The film is a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the Bond franchise, establishing a new [[alternate history|timeline]] and narrative framework not meant to precede ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' or any previous films.<ref>{{cite web | title=IGN: Interview: Campbell on Casino Royale | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/659/659741p1.html | work=IGN.com | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc | date=[[2005-10-19]] | accessdate=2007-03-22 }}</ref> It is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, which was previously produced as a [[Casino Royale (1954)|1954 television episode]] and a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 film spoof]]. However, the [[2006 in film|2006]] release is the only [[EON_Productions#James_Bond_series|"official"]] [[EON Productions]] adaptation of Fleming's novel.

The film is set at the beginning of James Bond's career as a 00-agent, having earned his [[Licence to kill (concept)|license to kill]]. After foiling a [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack at [[Miami International Airport]], Bond falls for [[Vesper Lynd]], the [[HM Treasury|treasury]] agent assigned to provide the money he needs to foil a high-stakes [[poker tournament]] organized by [[Le Chiffre]]. 

''Casino Royale'' was produced by EON Productions for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], marking the first official Bond film to be [[Coproduction|co-produced]] by the latter studio, which had produced and originally distributed the 1967 [[Canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] spoof film version.

The [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] for ''Casino Royale'' involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy over Daniel Craig when he was eventually selected &mdash; some [[Pierce Brosnan]] fans threatened to [[boycott]] the film in protest.<ref>{{cite web | title=Blond, James Blond | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/08/commentary/mediabiz/index.htm| work=CNN | publisher=CNN | date=[[2006-11-06]] | accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> Despite this, the film, and Daniel Craig's performance in particular, earned critical acclaim. 

==Production==
[[EON Productions]] gained the rights for ''Casino Royale'' in 1999 after [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] exchanged them for [[MGM]]'s rights to [[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Devin Zydel|title=Barbara Broccoli On Bond, Daniel Craig, And More|publisher=CommanderBond.net|date=[[2007-02-13]]| url=http://commanderbond.net/article/4104| accessdate =2007-05-08}}</ref> In March 2004, [[Neal Purvis]] and [[Robert Wade]] began writing a screenplay for [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Bond, aiming to bring back an Ian Fleming flavour.<ref>{{cite web | title=Purvis & Wade Talk Bond & Jinx| publisher= MI6.co.uk| date= [[2004-03-09]] | url= http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/event_purvis_wade_talk.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21 | accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] expressed interest in directing an adaptation of ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'',<ref>{{cite news | title= Kill Bill director aims for Bond| publisher=[[BBC]] | date=[[2004-05-16]]|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3718975.stm|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> though this was only a personal interest, and he didn't follow this up with EON. In February 2005, [[Martin Campbell]], who had previously directed the [[1995 in film|1995]] Bond film ''[[GoldenEye]]'', was announced as the film's director.<ref>{{cite web|author=EON Productions|title=James Bond 21 Is Casino Royale|publisher=MI6.co.uk|date=[[2005-02-03]]|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_announced.php3 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Later, in 2005 Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with this film.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Consortium Led by Sony Corporation of America, Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Comcast Corporation and DLJ Merchant Banking Partners Enters into Definitive Agreement to Acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer| publisher = Sony Corporation| date = 2004-09-23| url = http://www.sony.com/SCA/press/040924.shtml| accessdate = 2007-04-29|}}</ref>

EON admitted that they had relied too heavily on [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects in the more recent films, particularly ''[[Die Another Day]]'', and were keen to accomplish the stunts in ''Casino Royale'' "the old fashioned way".<ref>{{cite news| last = Alberge| first = Dayla| title = Fake stunts banished as new Bond keeps it real| publisher = [[The Times Online]] |date=[[2006-03-14]] | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2084375,00.html| accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade, and [[Paul Haggis]] wanted the script to follow as closely as possible to the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming's darker storyline and characterization of Bond.<ref name="cinematographer">{{cite news | author = Jon Silberg | title = High Stakes for 007 | publisher = [[American Cinematographer]] | date = December 2006 | url = http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/December2006/CasinoRoyale/page1.php | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

''Casino Royale'' became the first Bond film to take its title from a Fleming novel or short story since 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. It is also the first Bond film since then not to be adapted as a [[novelization]]. Instead, a film [[tie-in]] edition of Fleming's original novel was published.<ref>{{cite web | last = Stamos | first = Athena | title = Casino Royale Movie Tie-in Edition | publisher = CommanderBond.net |date=[[2006-04-02]] | url = http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/3165-1.shtml | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Image:007CraigbecomingBond.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Daniel Craig makes the official press appearance on [[October 14]] [[2005]] when he is announced as the sixth James Bond]]
When Pierce Brosnan became the fifth actor to portray the character in 1995, he had a three film contract with an option for a fourth that expired with ''[[Die Another Day]]'' in 2002. In the ''Die Another Day'' DVD documentary, Brosnan stated: "I had a blast. I wanted to go out with a high note, but I think it's time for both me and the producers to move on. I'm done with Bond".

Throughout 2004 and 2005, a whole legion of potential new actors to portray James Bond were speculated on by the media, ranging from well established Hollywood actors, such as [[Eric Bana]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Goran Visnjic]] and [[Clive Owen]], to many unknown actors from a number of different countries.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dallas & Casino Royale Casting Rumors | url= http://www.movieweb.com/news/95/9395.php | work=Variety | publisher= MovieWeb, Inc | date=[[2005-09-28]] | accessdate=2007-03-21 }}</ref> At one point producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] claimed there was a list of over 200 names being considered.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4337224.stm| title= Michael G. Wilson said 200 actors had been considered| publisher=BBC,co.uk | date=[[2006-11-14]] | accessdate=2007-04-04 }}</ref> Rumours surrounding Owen intensified in early 2005 after he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] and a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his [[2004 in film|2004]] film, ''[[Closer (movie)|Closer]]''. English actor [[Colin Salmon]], who had played the role of MI6 operative [[Charles Robinson (James Bond)|Charles Robinson]] in earlier Bond films alongside Pierce Brosnan, was also considered for the role and raised speculation that he might become the first black Bond.<ref> {{cite news | title=Bets off as actor backed for Bond|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4065229.stm| publisher = BBC.co.uk| date=[[2004-12-04]]| accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref> However, according to Martin Campbell, [[Henry Cavill]] was the only actor in serious contention for the role &mdash; but being only 22 years old, he was considered too young.<ref name="cast2">{{cite web | author = Chavez, Kellvin | url= http://www.latinoreview.com/films_2005/sonypictures/zorro2/mc-interview.html | publisher=Latino Review | title= Exclusive interview with Martin Campbell on Zorro and Bond | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

In May 2005, Daniel Craig announced that MGM and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him that he had the job, and [[Matthew Vaughn]] told reporters that MGM offered him the opportunity to direct, but EON Productions at that point had not approached either of them.<ref>{{cite web | title= Craig, Vaughn on Bond | url= http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/609/609721p1.html |date= [[2005-05-03]] | publisher = IGN Entertainment, Inc. | date = [[May 3]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> Later, Craig stated that the producers had indeed offered him the role, but he had declined until a script was available for him to read.<ref> {{cite web | title=Seven's Deadly Sins| url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1949392,00.html | work= | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date= November 17 2006|accessdate= 2007-04-03}}</ref> 

By August 2005, speculation was still high that the 37-year-old Daniel Craig was being seriously considered, although full casting for the role was not actually done until September. Then, on [[October 14]] [[2005]], EON Productions and Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed to the public at a press conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://us.imdb.com/news/sb/2005-10-14#film3 | publisher=StudioBriefing | title=The Name's Craig, Daniel Craig | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

Significant controversy followed the decision, as fans wondered if the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period Internet campaigns such as "danielcraigisnotbond.com" expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to [[boycott]] the film in protest.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.moono.com/news/news01533.html|title=Anti-Bond protests|publisher=Moono|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of the character to which the public had become accustomed.<ref>{{cite web | title=Blond, James Blond | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/08/commentary/mediabiz/index.htm| work=CNN | publisher=CNN | date=[[2006-11-06]] | accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>

The producers soon turned their attention to the casting of the lead [[Bond girl]], Vesper Lynd. [[Casting (performing arts)|Casting director]] Debbie McWilliams has acknowledged that Hollywood actresses [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Charlize Theron]] were "strongly considered" for the role and that [[Belgium|Belgian]] actress [[CÃ©cile de France]] had also auditioned, but her [[English English|English accent]] "wasn't up to scratch."<ref>{{cite web| title = Casino Royale Bond girl candidates | publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]] |date= [[2006-07-07]]| url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_girl_casting_rumours.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Audrey Tautou]] was also considered, but ultimately not chosen because of her role in ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' that was released in May 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4470 | title= The New Bond Girls! | publisher = superherohype.com |date= [[2006-07-07]] | accessdate=2006-03-04}}</ref> [[France|French]] actress [[Eva Green]] was finally announced as Vesper Lynd on [[February 16]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://us.imdb.com/news/sb/2006-02-17#film5 | publisher=StudioBriefing | title=New Bond Girl Will Be "Very Much an Equal to Bond" | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[Image:Casino Royale settings.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Locations where ''Casino Royale'' takes place.]]
[[Principal photography]] for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on [[January 30]], [[2006]], and concluded on [[July 21]], [[2006]]. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]], with additional location shooting in the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Production returned to the Bond series' traditional home at [[Pinewood Studios]] to complete the shooting schedule.<ref name="Real">{{cite video|title=James Bond: For Real|medium=DVD|publisher=Special Treats Productions| date = 2006 }}</ref>

Initially, Michael G. Wilson confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would be filmed and/or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, following problems for EON Productions in securing film locations in South Africa,<ref>{{cite news | last = Cox| first = John| title = Eon facing South African detour| publisher = CommanderBond.net|date= [[2005-08-08]]| url = http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2877 | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and Phil Meheux (director of photography) were scouting [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Paradise Island]] in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] as a possible location for the film.<ref> {{cite news | last = Cox| first = John| title = Bond bound for Bahamas|date=[[2005-09-13]] | publisher = CommanderBond.net | url = http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2922| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> On [[October 6]], [[2005]], Martin Campbell confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would film in the Bahamas and "maybe Italy." In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt coordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague and at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England where the film used several stages as well as the paddock tank and the historic [[Albert R. Broccoli]] [[007 Stage]]. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for [[Dunsfold]] Aerodrome in [[Surrey]], the cricket pavilion at [[Eton College]] (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].<ref name="Location2">{{cite news | last = Matheson | first = Veronica | title = On the trail of James Bond | publisher = News.com.au |date=  | url = http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,23483,20707920-27978,00.html | accessdate =2007-03-23}}</ref>
[[Image:Daniel Craig on Venice yacht crop w Wilson.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Craig and Michael G. Wilson in Venice during filming.]]

Principal photography began in Prague on [[January 30]], [[2006]], after which the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around [[New Providence]] were used for filming during February and March, largely on Paradise Island and in the southern Coral Harbour area, with an abandoned Royal Bahamian Air Force base being a particularly important location for the production. Footage set in [[Mbale]], Uganda was filmed at Black Park, Country Park in Buckinghamshire concluding on [[July 4]], [[2006]]. Additional scenes took place at Albany House â an estate recently acquired by golfers [[Ernie Els]] and [[Tiger Woods]].<ref>{{cite news | title = James Bond takes over Ernie and Tiger's pad | publisher = Ernie Els Official Website |date= [[2006-06-12]] | url = http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, [[PlanÃ¡ (Tachov District)|PlanÃ¡]] and [[Loket]], before completing in the town of [[Karlovy Vary]] in May. A disused [[destination spa|spa]], formerly known as the Kaisersbad, in Karlovy Vary was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale, with the [[Grandhotel Pupp]] serving as the "Hotel Splendide".<ref>{{cite news | title = On set report from Casino Royale getaway chase sequence | publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]] |date= [[2006-05-23]]| url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=3701&catid=2 | accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> The main Italian location mentioned by Campbell was [[Venice]], where the majority of the film's ending is set. Other scenes in the latter half of the film were filmed in late May and early June at the [[Villa del Balbianello]] on the shores of [[Lake Como]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Roth | first = Tim | title = Italian location revealed | publisher = CommanderBond.net |date= [[2006-02-28]] | url = http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/3119-1.shtml | accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa la Gaeta, near the lakeside town of [[Menaggio]].<ref name="Location2"/>

On [[July 30]], [[2006]], a fire broke out at the [[007 Stage]] at Pinewood. The damage was significant, but had no effect on the release of ''Casino Royale'' as the incident occurred one week after filming had been completed, and the sets were in the process of being dismantled.<ref>{{cite news | title = Fire wrecks James Bond film stage| publisher = [[BBC News]]|date= [[2006-07-30]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5228794.stm| accessdate =2006-11-21 }}</ref> On [[August 11]], [[2006]], Pinewood Studios confirmed that no attempt would be made to salvage the remains of the stage,<ref>{{cite news | title = 007 stage destroyed by fire| publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]]|date=[[2006-07-30]]| url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/event_pinewood_fire.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> instead it would be rebuilt from scratch.<ref>{{cite news| title = UK release date pulled a day forward to 16th November| publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]]|date=[[2006-09-21]]| url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=4114&catid=4| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref>

===Effects===
[[Image:GunBarrelPhoto.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[James Bond gun barrel sequence|gunbarrel sequence]] modified as part of the opening sequence]]
In designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer [[Daniel Kleinman]] was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of ''Casino Royale'', which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with [[blood]].<ref name=book>Fleming, Ian. ''Casino Royale''. London: Jonathan Cape (1953).</ref> Kleinman said, "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed [[artery|arteries]] spurting thousands of tiny hearts.<ref>{{cite web | title=Credits deisgn | url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=4511| work=Daniel Kleinman | publisher=MI6.com | date=[[2006-12-06]] | accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitized the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at the Framestore CFC in London; the actors' [[silhouette]]s were incorporated  into approximately 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns.<ref name=cfc>{{cite web|title=Commercials at Framestore CFC|url=http://www.framestore-cfc.com/commercials/index.html|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

For the rest of the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor [[Chris Corbould]], like the producers, wanted to return to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduce digital effects. According to Corbould, âCGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. Itâs the best way to goâ.<ref name="Real"/> The three biggest scenes involving special effects in the film were those involving the chase at a building site in [[Madagascar]], the Miami International Airport tarmac chase sequence, and the sinking [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian house]], with scenes located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name="Real"/>

First on the schedule were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot on location in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel which producer Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with as far back as 1977 during the filming of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref name="Real"/> In the scene, Bond hi-jacks an 18-ton [[Engineering vehicle|digger]] and drives over 30 miles per hour toward the building, destroying a hut, then slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward two or three ways that the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger, and reinforced with steel. After two tests, the concrete curled around the bucket, and it came out like a wave.<ref name="Real"/>

The sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in [[Surrey]], with some footage captured at Prague and Miami airports with the first and second units of the film taking some 10 weeks to shoot the entire sequence. Coubold stated; "Iâve had experience with tankers before in ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', and they are beasts to work with once you have all that tonnage hurling around; we souped up the tankers to get some high-speed collisions."<ref name="Real"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to snatch the car up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name="Real"/>

The sinking Venetian house at the action climax of the film was the largest rig ever built on any Bond film.<ref name="Real"/> For the scene involving Bond following Vesper and Gettler into the house undergoing renovation, supported by inflatable [[balloon]]s, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian [[piazza]] and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated [[electronics]] with [[hydraulic]] valves which were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axis. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in 19 feet of water, and utilized banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.<ref name="Real"/>

The scene involving the high speed car crash was devised using a specially modified and reinforced [[Aston Martin DBS V12]] to counteract the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18 inch [[ramp]] had to be implemented on the road tarmac and stunt driver Adam Kirley had to use an air cannon located behind the drivers seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a velocity well exceeding 70 mph the car rotated seven times during the take, and was later confirmed by the [[Guiness Book of Records]] on [[November 5]], [[2006]] as a new [[World Record]], the previous record being five rolls.<ref name="Real"/>

<!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Please help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot of Casino Royale does not belong here. -->

James Bond must make two kills to qualify for double-0 status, granting him a licence to kill. In the opening sequence, he is sent on a mission to [[Prague]] to make those kills: the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] section chief, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Dryden|Dryden]], who has sold British secrets, and his contact, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Fisher|Fisher]]. Elsewhere, a mysterious [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] is acting as a [[middleman]], introducing underground banker [[Le Chiffre]] to a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla group]] seeking safe haven for their funds. Although Le Chiffre tells his clients there is "no risk" in his investments, he uses their money to engineer attacks on certain companies and [[short sell]]s their stock to make large personal gains.

In his first mission as a double-0, Bond is sent to [[Madagascar]] in pursuit of international bomb-maker [[Mollaka]]. After a [[free running]] chase to the [[List of fictional countries|Nambutu]] embassy, he kills the bomb-maker and is forced to blow up part of the embassy to escape. Bond's actions are recorded on [[closed-circuit television]] and exposed in the world press, enraging [[M (James Bond)|M]], his boss at MI6. Bond obtains the bomb-maker's [[mobile phone]] and notes it has been receiving calls from an identifiable location in the [[Bahamas]]. Bond visits the [[Bahamas]] and finds [[Alex Dimitrios]], who is linked to Le Chiffre, was the caller. Afterwards, as Bond seduces [[Solange (James Bond)|Solange]], Dimitrios's wife, she informs him that her husband is flying to Miami. Bond leaves to pursue him. In Miami, Bond kills Dimitrios, and follows Le Chiffre's henchman Carlos through the [[Miami International Airport|airport]] terminal and out along the runway in a fuel truck. Bond successfully foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype ''Skyfleet'' airliner and thus leaves Le Chiffre with a major loss, since he shorted the company.

[[Image:CasinoRoyalePhoto.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond (right) and Le Chiffre (left) face off at Casino Royale]]
Now under pressure to recoup his clients' money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament to bankrupt Le Chiffre, hoping that he will be forced to aid the British government in exchange for protection from his creditors. Bond meets up with [[List of James Bond allies in Casino Royale#Ren.C3.A9 Mathis|Mathis]], his contact in Montenegro, and Vesper Lynd, a Treasury agent, who is assigned to look after Bond's handling of the $10 million [[buy-in]]. When Bond misreads Le Chiffre as [[bluffing]] and loses his initial stake, Vesper refuses to give him the funds to [[buying in|rebuy]]. Bond almost resorts to murdering Le Chiffre, but the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s [[Felix Leiter]] steps in and gives him the money in exchange for custody of Le Chiffre if Bond wins.  Despite Le Chiffre's attempts to kill Bond, he wins the tournament. Before the CIA can offer Le Chiffre sanctuary, he kidnaps Vesper and uses her to lure Bond into a near-fatal car chase.  Bond crashes his car and is captured.  Le Chiffre then tortures him for the access code to the game's winnings. When it becomes clear that Bond will not give in, Le Chiffre advances to [[castration|castrate]] him, but before he can, [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] enters and kills Le Chiffre and his associates for their failure. Bond and Vesper are left alive.

Bond awakens in a hospital on [[Lake Como]] and has Mathis, whom Le Chiffre suggested was a [[double agent]], arrested. Bond admits his love for Vesper and vows to quit the service before it strips him of his humanity. When she agrees, Bond e-mails his resignation to M, and the two go on a romantic holiday in [[Venice]]. Bond soon learns that the funds were never deposited in the Treasury's account and finds Vesper taking the money through Venice to an organization vaguely alluded to throughout the film. Bond pursues her into a building under renovation and deliberately shoots the flotation balloons supporting the structure, causing the foundation to slowly collapse into the [[Grand Canal of Venice|Grand Canal]]. Vesper tearfully apologizes to Bond and commits suicide by locking herself in an elevator that plunges underwater. Bond tries to rescue her and eventually manages to break into the elevator and bring Vesper to the surface &mdash; but it is too late, his attempts at [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] fail. Mr. White, standing on an opposite balcony surveying the scene, walks away with the money.

Bond, feeling betrayed, learns that MI6 believed Vesper only negotiated the handover of money in order to save Bond's life from Le Chiffre and the organization he works for, showing her true love for him. Bond, who has Vesper's mobile phone, discovers that she intentionally left Mr. White's name and number for him to find. In the closing scene, Mr. White, arriving at a palatial estate aside Lake Como, receives a phone call. A voice on the line says, "Mr. White? We need to talk." As White asks "Who is this?", he is shot in the leg. As he crawls towards the villa, Bond appears, gun in hand, and responds with the iconic [[catch phrase]] "The name's Bond, James Bond," as the credits roll.

Two major exclusions from the film are the characters of [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny]]. They were not included in the screenplay, which makes this only the second Bond film without Q since his initial appearance in Dr. No (1973's ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' being the first) and the first without Moneypenny. In October 2005, producer Michael G. Wilson stated that the characters were not in the movie because they were not in the book. However Moneypenny did actually appear in the novel but had only one line of dialogue, although [[Q (James Bond)|Major Boothroyd]], which the films transformed into the character Q, did not appear until several books later.<ref>{{cite news| last = Hastings | first = Chris | coauthors = Nina Goswami and David Fickling | title = Ah, Miss Moneypenny.

The decision to leave Moneypenny's character out from the film also coincided with actress [[Samantha Bond]], who had portrayed the character in the previous four films, announcing that she would not be reprising the role.

===Cameos===
{{spoilers}}
The movie features [[cameo appearance|cameo roles]] by British entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]] (seen being [[Frisking|frisked]] at Miami airport), American hotel tycoon Jerry Inzerillo, Brazilian [[supermodel]] [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] (seen when Bond first approaches the Ocean Club), and [[Sens Unik]] rapper [[Carlos Leal]]. Key members of the production also feature in cameo roles â producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] appears as the corrupt Montenegrin police chief, continuing his long-standing tradition of Bond film cameos dating from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', while director of cinematography Phil Meheux features briefly as a treasury bureaucrat in [[Washington D.C.]]. Even the film's director [[Martin Campbell]] makes a fleeting cameo as the face of the murdered petrol tanker driver at Miami Airport. In addition, [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]], who played [[List of James Bond allies in You Only Live Twice#Ling|Ling]] in the opening sequence of ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', and Diane Hartford, who had a small part in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (as the girl Bond dances with while escaping from [[Fiona Volpe]]) appear respectively as Madame Wu (the Chinese woman playing cards with Le Chiffre aboard his yacht) and one of the players in the Bahamas poker game. Sixties model [[Veruschka|"Veruschka" von Lehndorff]] also appears in the background at the casino.

==Release==
''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]], the [[Odeon West End]] and the [[Empire (cinema)|Empire]] simultaneously in London on [[November 14]], [[2006]]. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], was in attendance with the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]. It was the third James Bond premiere that the Queen had attended following ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967) and ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002).<ref> {{cite web| title = Daniel Craig makes his 007 debut at premiere of Casino Royale| publisher = [[Daily Mail]]| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=416461&in_page_id=1773&ico=Homepage&icl=TabModule&icc=picbox&ct=5 |date= [[2006-11-18]]|accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.<ref>{{cite news| title = Stars out for Bond royal premiere| publisher = [[BBC News]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6146090.stm |date= [[2006-11-14]] | accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref>

The premiere was immediately followed by pirate copies of the film appearing for sale in London, only two days later. âThe rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK,â said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6157066.stm

===North America===
Opening day estimates in the United States and Canada show it on top with [[United States dollar|$]]14,750,000. Opening weekend estimates in the United States and Canada put it in second place with $40,600,000,<ref>{{cite news | title = Casino Royale grosses $40.6 million| publisher = SuperHeroHype!|date= [[2006-11-19]] | url =http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4922| accessdate = 2006-11-19}}</ref> as well as earning another $42,000,000 internationally. Although ''[[Happy Feet]]'' won the overall weekend box office contest, such a comparison in earnings is problematic, as ''Happy Feet'' has little more than half the running time of ''Casino Royale'', and therefore had significantly more screenings per day, which translates into more potential gross.  A better indication of the film's relative performances is that ''Casino Royale'', per theatre, outperformed ''Happy Feet'', which was released in 370 more theatres.  According to [[Box Office Mojo]], ''Casino Royale'' took in, on average, $11,890 per theatre, while ''Happy Feet'' grossed $10,918 per theatre.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=happyfeet.htm | title = Happy Feet (2006) box office | publisher = Box Office Mojo | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jamesbond21.htm | title = Casino Royale box office | publisher = Box Office Mojo | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref>

The special DVD also features the official music video for the film, featuring Chris Cornell.

==Reception==
[[film critic|Critic]]s gave the film a positive response, in particular Craig's performance and credibility as James Bond. During production this had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as Craig did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark, and [[suave]]. ''The Daily Mirror'' (which had once run a front page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, ''The Name's Bland - James Bland''<ref>{{cite news| title =  The Name's Bland.. James Bland | publisher = [[Daily Mirror]] |date=[[2006-10-15]]| url = http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16251427&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=the-name-s-bland---james-bland-name_page.html| accessdate =2006-12-27}}</ref>) and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' compared the quality of Craig's characterization of Bond to [[Sean Connery]]'s; and the Telegraph praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions. ''[[The Times]]'' compared the more assertive portrayal by Craig to [[Timothy Dalton]], and praised the action as edgy,<ref>{{cite news| title = "Brilliant" Bond seduces critics | publisher = [[BBC News]] |date=[[2006-11-04]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6116286.stm?ls| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.<ref>{{cite news| last = Wavell | first = Stuart | title = Potato Head shoots way to 007 triumph | publisher = The Sunday Times |date= [[2006-11-05]] | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2437998,00.html| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> Critic Paul Arendt of BBC Films,<ref>{{cite web| last = Arendt | first = Paul | title = Casino Royale (2006) | publisher = BBC Films | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/11/06/casino_royale_2006_review.shtml| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Kim Newman]] of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''<ref>{{cite web| last = Newman | first = Kim | authorlink = Kim Newman | title = Casino Royale | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10199| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> and Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<ref>{{cite news| last = McCarthy | first = Todd | title = Casino Royale | publisher = Variety |date= | url = http://www.variety.com/VE1117932077.html| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: cold, ruthless, and brutal.  

In North America, the movie was particularly well received.

However, there were mixed reactions to the film. Although American [[radio]] personality [[Michael Medved]] gave ''Casino Royale'' three stars (out of four), describing it as "intriguing, audacious and very original ... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas", he commented that the "sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics."<ref>{{cite news| author = [[Michael Medved]]| title = Casino Royale | publisher = Eye On Entertainment | url = http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/casinoroyale.doc| accessdate =2006-11-30}}</ref> Similarly, a reviewer for ''[[The Sun]]'' praised the film for its darkness and Craig's performance, but felt that "like the novel, it suffers from a lack of sharpness in the plot" and believed it required some editing, particularly the lengthy finale.<ref>{{cite web| title = The best Bond since Connery | publisher = [[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] |date=[[2006-10-20]]| url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006480716,00.html| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> Commentators such as Emanuell Levy concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.<ref>{{cite web| last = Levy| first = Emanuell| title = Casino Royale B+ | publisher = Emanuell Levy | url = http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=3668| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> In addition, Vesper Lynd (as portrayed by [[Eva Green]]) was chosen by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' as the fourth greatest Bond girl in the entire film series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joshua Rich|title=The 10 Best Bond Girls|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=[[2007-03-30]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1557446_8,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of ''[[The Observer]]'' who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier, and criticized Craig's performance with the review title "You might be shaken, but this Bond won't leave you stirred".<ref>{{cite web| last = Adams| first = Tim| title = You might be shaken, but this Bond won't leave you stirred| publisher = [[The Observer]]|date=[[2006-11-05]]| url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1939830,00.html| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Steve Sailer]] of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' also criticized the film, saying it was  "mediocre in execution and bloated in conception, wrapping the usual elephantine Bond movie mechanics around Fleming's minimal plot."<ref>{{cite news| last = Sailer| first = Steve| title = Unshaken, unstirred | publisher = The American Conservative | url = http://www.isteve.com/Film_Casino_Royale.htm| date=2006-12-18 |accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack to the 2006 film ''Casino Royale'' was released by [[Sony Classical]] on [[November 14]], [[2006]]. The music was written by veteran composer David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series. Frequent collaborator Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the score. 

Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on [[July 26]], [[2006]] that [[Chris Cornell]], the former [[Audioslave]] and [[Soundgarden]] lead singer, composed and would perform the title song "[[You Know My Name]]" for ''Casino Royale''.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/07-26-2006/0004404210&EDATE= | title=Chris Cornell Has Written and Will Perform the Main Title Song for CASINO ROYALE | date = [[2006-07-26]]| accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref> Various names were reported in the media prior to the announcement, including a return of [[Tina Turner]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=3815| title = Tina Turner links herself to Casino Royale theme song| accessdate=2006-06-21 | publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]] | date = [[2006-06-21]]}}</ref> who sang "[[GoldenEye (song)|GoldenEye]]" in 1995, and [[Tony Christie]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/article979663.ece| date = [[2005-10-15]] | publisher = [[The Belfast Telegraph]]| title=Christie gambles on casino hit| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

Cornell was first reported to be writing and performing the song in collaboration with David Arnold on [[July 20]], [[2006]] by the Finnish newspaper ''Ilta-Sanomat'' and the complete score was completed early on the morning of [[October 11]], [[2006]].<ref name="arnold">{{cite web| title=David Arnold| url=http://www.davidarnold.com| publisher=David Arnold|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> "You Know My Name" is the first theme song since 1983's ''[[Octopussy]]'' to use a different title than the film, and Cornell is the first male performer since [[a-ha]] (in 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]'').  It is only the fourth Bond theme (after the opening medley of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', the instrumental theme from ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and "All Time High" from ''Octopussy'') to make no reference to the title of the film.<ref name="arnold"/> It is also the first title song to be repeated in the end credits since "A View to a Kill". The end titles begin with the James Bond theme, but halfway through cut to an abbreviated version of the Cornell song.

However, the theme song itself is not present on the album soundtrack since it was released as a separate single. Consistent with the reboot of the James Bond storyline, only at the end, when Bond resumes his usual role, is the original [[James Bond Theme]] used.
