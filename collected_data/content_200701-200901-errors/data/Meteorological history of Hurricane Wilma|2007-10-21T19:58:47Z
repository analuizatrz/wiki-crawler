[[Image:Wilma 2005 track.png|250px|thumb|right|The path of Hurricane Wilma]]
The '''meteorological history of [[Hurricane Wilma]]''', the most intense known [[tropical cyclone]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]], began in the second week of October 2005. A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and gradually organized to the southeast of [[Jamaica]]. By late on [[October 15]], the system was sufficiently organized for the [[National Hurricane Center]] to designate it as [[Tropical depression|Tropical Depression]] Twenty-Four.

The depression drifted southwestward, and under favorable conditions, it [[tropical cyclogenesis|strengthened]] into [[Tropical Storm]] ''[[Wilma]]'' on [[October 17]]. Initially, development was slow due to its large size, though [[convection#Atmospheric convection|convection]] steadily organized. From [[October 18]], and through the following day, Wilma underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean; in a 30-hour period, the system's central [[atmospheric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[inch of mercury|inHg]]) to the record-low value of 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg), while the winds increased to 185&nbsp;mph (300&nbsp;km/h). At its peak intensity, the [[eye (cyclone)|pinhole eye]] of Wilma was about 3&nbsp;miles (5&nbsp;km) in diameter, the smallest known eye in an [[Atlantic hurricane]]. After the inner eye dissipated due to an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], Wilma weakened to [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4 status]], and on [[October 21]], it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on [[Cozumel]] and on the [[Mexico|Mexican mainland]] with winds of about 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h).

Wilma weakened over the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], and reached the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]] before accelerating northeastward. Despite increasing amounts of [[wind shear]], the hurricane re-strengthened to hit [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] as a major hurricane. Wilma weakened as it quickly crossed the state, and entered the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane again re-intensified before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection. On [[October 26]], it transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]], and the next day, the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over [[Atlantic Canada]].

==Formation==

The origin of Hurricane Wilma is complicated. During the second week of October, an unusually large, [[monsoon trough|monsoon]]-like lower-level circulation and a broad area of disturbed weather developed over much of the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The system was enhanced by [[diffluence]]—the rate at which a fluid moves—from an upper-level low across the southwestern Atlantic.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Richard J. Pasch, Eric S.

Later on [[October 14]], the system became much better defined, with increasingly organized shower and thunderstorm activity, as conditions in the upper levels of the atmosphere became significantly more favorable. It was then that the [[National Hurricane Center]] first indicated that it was possible for a tropical depression to develop in the area.<ref name="1014two2">{{cite web|author=Stewart|year=2005|title=October 14 Tropical Weather Outlook (2)|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-15|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2005/Oct/2005101421.ABNT20}}</ref> [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] were initiated on [[October 15]].<ref name="tcr"/> The system continued to organize, with the National Hurricane Center remarking the system could ultimately become a hurricane.<ref name="1015two">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2005|title=October 15 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-15|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2005/Oct/2005101515.ABNT20}}</ref> By late on [[October 15]], the surface circulation became defined well-enough, with sufficiently organized deep convection, for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while it was located about 220&nbsp;miles (345&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]].<ref name="tcr"/>

The depression tracked slowly westward, a motion due to weak steering currents caused by a [[ridge (meteorology)|high pressure system]] to its north across the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, the center of circulation was broad without a defined inner core; forecaster [[Lixion Avila]] remarked, "The area of minimum pressure could [have been] anywhere within 60&nbsp;miles (95&nbsp;km) of its [initial advisory position]." Initially, the tropical depression was forecast to drift west-southwestward before turning to the north; within 120&nbsp;hours of the forecast's issuance, the system was predicted to be located about 80&nbsp;miles (130&nbsp;km) south of the [[Isle of Youth]] as a 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h) hurricane. However, the National Hurricane Center noted in the first advisory on the depression that there were "all indications that there could a dangerous hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in 3 to 5 days." This was due to the depression being located within an environment very conducive for [[tropical cyclogenesis|development]], specifically low amounts of wind shear and very warm [[sea surface temperature|water temperatures]].<ref name="disc1">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2005|title=Tropical Depression Twenty-Four Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al242005.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

As Tropical Depression Twenty-Four drifted southwestward, it steadily organized; by early on [[October 16]], [[tropical cyclone#Physical structure|rainband]]s began to gradually consolidate with well-established [[tropical cyclone#Physical structure|outflow]], and a large upper-level [[anticyclone]] developed over the depression.<ref name="disc2">{{cite web|author=Knabb|year=2005|title=Tropical Depression Twenty-Four Discussion Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al242005.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> Although deep convection and [[tropical cyclone#Physical structure|banding feature]]s increased, mid-level dry air from the north prevented significant organization, and the convection was split into two primary areas.

==Peak strength==

By early on [[October 17]], the outer rainbands, which had previously dominated the structure of the cyclone, dissipated, while deep convection developed near and to the south of the center. [[Numerical weather prediction|Computer models]] predicted steady strengthening as the depression tracked westward before turning to the north. Of the intensity models, the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] predicted an intensity of 135&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) within 36&nbsp;hours, with other forecasts being more conservative in their predictions.<ref name="disc6">{{cite web|author=Knabb|year=2005|title=Tropical Depression Twenty-Four Discussion Six|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al242005.discus.006.shtml?}}</ref> Deep convection continued to develop to the south of the center, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Wilma at 0600&nbsp;UTC on [[October 17]], while located about 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) southeast of Grand Cayman.
