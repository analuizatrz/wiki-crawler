'''''Herrerasaurus''''' (meaning "Herrera's lizard" after the name of the rancher who discovered the first fossil of the animal) was one of the earliest [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]]s. The only known specimens were discovered in northwest [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]], in late [[Triassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] rocks (Early [[Carnian]] [[faunal stage|stage]], around 228 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]]). The [[type species]], ''Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis'', was described by Reig in 1963,<ref name="Reig1963"/> and is the only species assigned to the genus. 

For many years, it was unclear whether ''Herrerasaurus'', initially known from very fragmentary remains, was a [[Theropoda|theropod]] or a very early dinosaur which predated theropod evolution. However, with the discovery of several pieces of the skeleton and a complete skull, in 1988,<ref name ="Sereno1988"> {{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=Paul C.|coauthors=F. E. Novas, A. B. Arcucci, C. Yu|year=1988|title=New evidence on dinosaur and mammal origins from the

This medium-sized bipedal reptile is a member of the [[Herrerasaur]]idae, a group of similar animals which were among the earliest of the dinosaurian fauna.

==Description==
<!-- [[Image:Herrerasaurus 2.jpg|thumb|left|Model of ''Herrerasaurus'' head ('Dinosaurland' in [[Lyme Regis]]).]] -->

''Herrerasaurus'' was a lightly built bipedal carnivore with a long tail and a relatively small head. It is estimated that ''Herrerasaurus'' could have reached 5&nbsp;[[metre|meters]] (15&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) in length, and over 1&nbsp;meter (3&nbsp;ft) in height at the hips. It is estimated to have weighed around 100&nbsp;[[kilogram]]s (220&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lbs]]).

===Skull===
''Herrerasaurus'' had a long, narrow [[skull]] approximately 33&nbsp;[[centimetre|centimeters]] (1&nbsp;ft) long that lacked nearly all the specializations that characterized later dinosaurs,<ref name="Sereno1993">{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=Paul C.|coauthors=F. E. Novas|year=1993|title=The skull and neck of the basal theropod Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=13|pages=451-476.}}</ref> being not that different from those of more primitive [[archosaur]]s such as ''[[Euparkeria]]''. It had five pairs of [[temporal fenestra|fenestra]]e (skull openings) in its skull, two of which were for ocular and nasal openings. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two [[antorbital fenestra]]e, and a pair of tiny, 1&nbsp;centimeter long slit-like holes called [[promaxillary fenestra]]e.<ref name="Sereno07">{{cite journal| last =Sereno| first =P.C.| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The phylogenetic relationships of early dinosaurs: a comparative report| journal =Historical Biology| volume =19| issue =1| pages =145-155| publisher =| date =2007| url =http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08912960601167435| doi =10.1080/08912960601167435| id =ISSN 0891-2963| accessdate =}}</ref> Behind the eyes were large [[infratemporal fenestra]]e. These holes helped reduce the weight of the skull. 

''Herrerasaurus'' had a flexible joint in the lower jaw; this allowed the animal to slide its lower jaw back and forth and deliver a grasping bite. Shared by the contemporary ''Eoraptor'', this cranial specialization is highly unusual among the dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards.<ref name="McDowell1954">{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=S. B., Jr.|coauthors=C. M. Bogert|year=1954|title=The systematic position of ''Lanthanotus'' and the affinities of the anguinomorphan lizards|journal=Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist|volume=105|pages=1-142.}}</ref> The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestra, which reduced the weight of the bone. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh. The neck was slender and flexible.<ref name="Sereno1993"/><ref name="Novas1994">{{cite journal|last=Novas|first=F. E.|year=1994|title=New information on the systematics and postcranial skeleton of ''Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis'' (Theropoda: Herrerasauridae) from the Ischigualasto Formation (Upper Triassic) of Argentina|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=13|issue=4|pages=400-423}}</ref>

===Limbs===
''Herrerasaurus'' had relatively short forelimbs less than half the length of its hind limbs. The [[humerus]] and [[radius]] were rather short, while the [[manus]] was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb bore curved, sharp claws designed for grasping its prey. Its fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.<ref name="Sereno1992"/> <ref name="Sereno1993b">{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=P. C|year=1993|title=The pectoral girdle and forelimb of the basal theropod Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=13|pages=425-450.}}</ref>

It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, inidcating this animal was most likely a swift runner. The balancing tail partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral processes also indicates an adaptation for speed. ''Herrerasaurus'' was probably one of the first dinosaurs and was one of the first animals to adopt the distinctive bipedal [[theropod]]-like shape.  

This dinosaur is an enigmatic creature, showing traits that are found in different groups of dinosaurs. It is also similar to much later [[Jurassic]] dinosaurs. Although ''Herrerasaurus'' shared most of the characteristics of dinosaurs, there were a few differences, particularly in regard to the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis was similar to that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it had a bony [[acetabulum]] (where the [[femur]] meets the [[pelvis]]) which was only partially perforate.

==Classification==
''Herrerasaurus'' gives its name to its family [[Herrerasaur]]idae of the mid- to late Triassic, though where it and its close relatives lie on the early dinosaur evolutionary tree is unclear. They are possibly [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]  theropods or  basal [[saurischian]]s, but may in fact predate the [[Saurischian]]-[[Ornithischian]] split. Other members of the clade may include ''[[Eoraptor]]'' from the same [[Ischigualasto|Ischigualasto Formation]] of Argentina as ''Herrerasaurus'', ''[[Staurikosaurus]]'' from the [[Santa Maria Formation]] of southern Brazil,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Colbert|first=E.H.|year=1970|title=A saurischian dinosaur from the Triassic of Brazil|journal=Am.

Another basal theropod, ''[[Alwalkeria]]'' from the Late Triassic [[Maleri Formation]] of [[India]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=S.|coauthors=Creisler B.

Novas (1992) defined the group as ''Herrerasaurus'', ''Staurikosaurus'', and their most common ancestor. Sereno (1998) defined the group as the most inclusive clade including ''H. ischigualastensis'' but not ''[[House Sparrow|Passer domesticus]]''. Langer (2004) created a higher level taxon, infraorder Herrerasauria.<ref name="Langer04"/>

Another obscure dinosaur, ''Frenguellisaurus''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Novas|first=F. E.|year=1986|title=Un probable terópodo (Saurischia) de la Formación Ischigualasto (Triásico superior), San Juan, Argentina|journal=IV Congreso Argentino de Paleontología y Bioestratigrafía, Mendoza, november 23-27|volume=2|pages=1-6}}</ref> is now considered a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] of ''Herrerasaurus''.<ref name="Novas1994"/> ''[[Teyuwasu]]'', another genus known from very fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil, might be related.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kischlat|first=E.-E.|year=1999|title=A new dinosaurian “rescued” from the Brazilian Triassic: Teyuwasu barberenai, new taxon|journal=1st Simp.

==History==
''Herrerasaurus'' was named in 1963, after Victorino Herrera, an Andean [[goatherd]] who first noticed its fossils in outcrops near San Juan in 1959. Osvaldo Reig was the [[paleontologist]] who suggested the name.<ref name="Reig1963"/> These rocks, which also yielded ''[[Eoraptor]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=P. C.|coauthors=Forster C.

Reig believed ''Herrerasaurus'' was an early example of a [[Carnosauria|carnosaur]],<ref name="Reig1963">{{cite journal|last = Reig|first=O.A.|year=1963|title=La presencia de dinosaurios saurisquios en los "Estratos de Ischigualasto" (Mesotriásico Superior) de las provincias de San Juan y La Rioja (República Argentina)|journal= Ameghiniana|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3-20}}</ref> but this was the subject of much debate over the next thirty years, and the genus was variously classified during that time. In 1970, Steel classified ''Herrerasaurus'' as a [[prosauropod]].<ref name="Steel70">{{cite journal|last=Steel|first=R.|year= 1970|title =Part 14. Saurischia.

A complete ''Herrerasaurus'' skull was not found until 1988 by a team of paleontologists led by [[Paul Sereno]].<ref name = "Sereno1992"/><ref>{{cite episode| title = The Nature of the Beast| episodelink = | series = The Dinosaurs!| serieslink = | airdate = 1990| season = | number = 3}}</ref> Based on the new fossils, authors such as Holtz<ref name="Holtz95">{{cite journal|last = Holtz|first = T.R.,Jr.|coauthors = Padian, K. |year = 1995|title = Definition and diagnosis of

However, Sereno reclassified ''Herrerasaurus'' (and the Herrerasauridae) as primitive theropods. This classification has stuck, with Rauhut (2003),<ref name="Rauhut03">{{cite journal| last =Rauhut| first =O.W.M.| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The interrelationships and evolution of basal theropod dinosaurs| journal =Special Papers in Palaeontology| volume =69| issue =| pages =1-213| publisher =| date =2003 }}</ref> Bittencourt and Kellner (2004),<ref name="BittenKellner">{{cite journal| last =Bittencourt| first =J. | authorlink =| coauthors =W.A.

If ''Herrerasaurus'' was indeed a  theropod, it would indicate that theropods, [[sauropodomorph]]s, and [[ornithischian]]s diverged even earlier than Herrerasaurids, before the middle [[Carnian]] (age of the Ischigualasto Formation) and that "all three lineages independently evolved several dinosaurian features, such as a more advanced ankle joint or an open acetabulum".<ref name="Palaeos">{{cite web| last =White| first =A.T.| authorlink =| coauthors = M.A. Kazlev| title =Theropoda: Basal Theropods| work =| publisher =Palaeos.com| date =2003| url =http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/340Theropoda/340.100.html| format =| doi =| accessdate =}}</ref> This view is further supported by [[ichnology|ichnological]] records showing large tridactyl footprints that can only be attributed to a theropod dinosaur, dating from the [[Ladinian]] (middle Triassic) of the [[Los Rastros Formation]] in Argentina, and predating ''Herrerasaurus'' by 3-5 million years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=C.

The importance of ''Herrerasaurus'' and ''Eoraptor'' lies in the fact that their remains allow for directly testing the idea of dinosaurs being a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group, i.e. all dinosaurs have a common ancestor. The monophyly of dinosaurs has been explicity proposed in the 1970s<ref name="Bakker1974">{{cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Robert T.|coauthors=Peter M.

However only 1 cranial and 7 postcranial synapomorphies are actually supported by the study of ''Herrerasaurus'', and new additional ones were discovered.<ref name="Sereno1992"/>

==Paleobiology==
Although ''Herrerasaurus'' shared the body shape of the large carnivorous dinosaurs, it lived about 230 [[million years ago]], at a time when dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the sligthly later [[Los Colorados Formation]] consisted mainly of a variety of [[crurotarsi|crurotarsal]] archosaurs and [[synapsids]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=J. F.|year=1982|title=Faunal replacement in the Triassic of South America|journal=J. Vertebr. Paleontol.|volume=2|pages=362–371}}</ref><ref name="Bonaparte1979">{{cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=J.

By the end of the [[Triassic]] Period, dinosaurs would rule the planet and the mammal-like reptiles would be nearly gone. At the same time, some of the first mammals began to evolve.

''Herrerasaurus'' lived alongside another early dinosaur, ''[[Eoraptor]]'', as well as ''[[Saurosuchus]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last = Sill| first = W.D.| year = 1974 | title = The anatomy of Saurosuchus galilei and the relationships of the rauisuchid thecodonts | journal = Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology | volume = 146 | pages = 317–362}}</ref> a giant land-living meat-eating [[rauisuchia|rauisuchian]], ''[[Venaticosuchus]]'', an [[ornithosuchidae|ornithosuchid]] and the predatory [[chiniquodontidae|chiniquodontid]] [[cynodont]]s, in the jungles of Late Triassic [[South America]]. ''Herrerasaurus'' remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto formation. <ref name = "Rogers93"/> Herbivores were much more abundant than carnivores and were represented by  [[rhynchosaur]]s such as ''[[Hyperodapedon]]'' (formerly ''[[Scaphonyx]]''), [[aetosaur]]s, [[kannemeyeriidae|kannemeyeriid]] [[dicynodont]]s such as ''[[Ischigualastia]]'',  and [[traversodontidae|traversodontid]]s such as ''[[Exaeretodon]]''. They were much more abundant than early ornithischian dinosaur such as ''[[Pisanosaurus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=J.F.|year=1970|title=Annotated list of the South American Triassic tetrapods|journal=Gondwana Symposium Proceedings and Papers|volume=2|pages=665-682.}}</ref>

Studies suggest that the region where ''Herrerasaurus'' was found was during the Carnian, a volcanically active floodplain covered by forests and subject to strong seasonal rainfalls. Vegetation consisted of ferns (''[[Cladophlebis]]''), horsetails, sphenopsids and giant conifers (''[[Protojuniperoxylon]]'').<ref name="Bonaparte1979"/>

===Diet===
The teeth of ''Herrerasaurus'' indicate it was a carnivore; its size indicates it would have preyed upon small and medium-sized animals. It may have fed on other dinosaurs, such as the [[herbivore|herbivorous]] ''[[Pisanosaurus]]''. However, since ''Herrerasaurus'' lived during an era when other dinosaurs were uncommon, more plentiful prey would have included [[rhynchosaur]]s and [[aetosaur]]s. ''Herrerasaurus'' itself may have been preyed upon by giant [[rauisuchia|rauisuchid]]s like ''[[Saurosuchus]]''.
[[Coprolite]]s (fossilized dung) containing small bones but no trace of plant fragments, discovered in the Ischigualasto formation, have been assigned to ''Herrerasaurus'' based on fossil abundance.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Hollocher |first = Kurt T.|coauthors = Oscar A. Alcober, Carina E. Colombi, Thomas C. Hollocher |title = Carnivore Coprolites from the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation, Argentina: Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Evidence for Rapid Initial Mineralization| journal = Palaios |year = 2005| volume = 20 | pages = 51–63}}</ref> The mineralogical and chemical analysis of these coprolites indicate that the carnivorous animal had the ability to digest bones. Similar studies made on coprolites assigned to a big cretaceous theropod (most probably ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'') and concluding to the ability of dinosaurs to dissolve ingested bones, further strengthen  the assertion.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Chin | first =K. |coauthors = Tokaryk, T.T., Erickson, G.M., and Calk, L.C. | year = 1998 | title =A king-sized theropod coprolite| journal = Nature | volume = 393 | pages = 680–682}} </ref>

==In popular culture==
''Herrerasaurus'' is not as well known to paleontologists and the general public as other dinosaurs. However one fossilized specimen of ''Herrerasaurus'', originally found in the [[Patagonia]] region of [[Argentina]], is displayed at the [[Chicago]] [[Field Museum of Natural History]]. This is in part due to the age of the fossils: ''Herrerasaurus'' lived in the [[Triassic]], before most other dinosaurs existed. Fossils of ''Herrerasaurus'' were not described until 1963, and until recently, this genus remained relatively unknown to the general public. As a result, its appearances in popular culture have been limited. However, ''Herrerasaurus'' does appear in several recent video games. Among these are the ''[[Zoo Tycoon]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' game franchises.
