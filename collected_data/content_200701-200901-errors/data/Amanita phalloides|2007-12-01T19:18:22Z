'''''Amanita phalloides''''' (generally {{pronEng|æməˈnaɪtə fəˈlɔɪdiːz}}), commonly known as the '''death cap''', is a poisonous [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]], one of many in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. Widely distributed across [[Europe]], ''A. phalloides'' [[mycorrhiza|associates]] with various deciduous and coniferous trees. In some cases, death cap has been accidentally introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of [[oak]], [[chestnut]], and [[Pinus|pine]]. The large fruiting bodies (''i.e.'', the [[mushrooms]]) appear in summer and autumn; the [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]] are generally greenish in colour, with a white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s.

Coincidentally, these toxic mushrooms resemble several edible species commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental [[poison]]ing. ''A. phalloides'' is one of the most poisonous of all known toadstools. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor [[Claudius]] and [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]]. It has been the subject of much research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is [[alpha-amanitin|α-amanitin]], which damages the liver and kidneys, often fatally. No antidote is known.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The death cap was first described by French botanist [[Sébastien Vaillant]] in 1727, who gave a succinct phrase name "''Fungus phalloides, annulatus, sordide virescens, et patulus''", which is still recognizable as the fungus today.<ref>{{la icon}}{{cite book|last=Vaillant|first=Sébastien|year=1727|title=Botanicon Parisiense|location=Leide & Amsterdam|publisher=J. H. Verbeek and B. Lakeman|oclc=5146641}}</ref> Though the [[scientific name]] ''phalloides'' means "phallus-shaped", it is unclear whether it is named for its resemblance to a literal [[phallus]] or the stinkhorn mushrooms ''[[Phallus (genus)|Phallus]]''.
In 1821, [[Elias Magnus Fries]] described it as ''Agaricus phalloides'', but included all white Amanitas within its description.<ref>{{la icon}}{{cite book |last=Fries |first=Elias Magnus |title=Systema Mycologicum I |year=1821 |publisher=Ernesti

''Amanita phalloides'' is the [[type species]] of ''Amanita'' section ''Phalloideae'', a group that contains all of the deadly poisonous ''Amanita'' species thus far identified. Most notable of these are the species known as [[destroying angel]]s, namely ''[[Amanita virosa]]'' and ''[[Amanita bisporiga|A. bisporiga]]'' as well as the fool's mushroom ''([[Amanita verna|A. verna]])''. The term "destroying angel" has been applied to ''A. phalloides'' at times, but "death cap" is by far the most common vernacular name used in English. Other common names also listed include "stinking amanita"<ref name = "North67"/> and "deadly amanita".<ref name="benjamin203">Benjamin.p203</ref>

A rarely appearing all-white form was initially described ''A. phalloides'' f. ''alba'' by Max Britzelmayr,<ref name=tulloss/><ref name="Jord109">Jordan & Wheeler. p109</ref> though its status has been unclear. It is often found growing amid normally coloured death caps. It has been described, in 2004, as a distinct variety and includes what was termed ''A. verna'' var. ''tarda''.<ref name="Nevpoum04"/> The true ''Amanita verna'' fruits in spring and turns yellow with [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solution, whereas ''A. phalloides'' never does.<ref name=tullossverna>{{Cite web| last=Tulloss| first=Rodham E.| Month=July| Year=2006| url=http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/verna.html| title= Amanita verna (Bull.: Fr.)

==Description==
The death cap has a large and imposing [[epigeous]] (aboveground) [[fruiting body]] (basidiocarp), usually with a [[pileus]] (cap) from 5 to 15&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (2–6&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) across, initially rounded and hemispherical, but flattening with age.<ref name="Bresinsky">{{cite book | author= Bresinsky A, Besl H. | title = A Colour Atlas of Poisonous Fungi | year = 1990 | publisher = Wolfe Publishing | pages=26-9|id = ISBN 0-7234-1576-5}}</ref> The colour of the cap can be pale-, yellowish-, or olive-green, often paler toward the margins and often paler after rain. The cap surface is sticky when wet and easily peeled, a troublesome feature, as that is allegedly a feature of edible fungi.<ref name="Jord99">Jordan & Wheeler. p99</ref> The remains of the [[partial veil]] is seen as a skirtlike, floppy [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]] usually about 1 to 1.5&nbsp;cm (0.4&ndash;0.6&nbsp;in) below the cap. The crowded white [[Lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] (gills) are free. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white with a scattering of grayish-olive scales and is 8 to 15&nbsp;cm (3&ndash;6&nbsp;in) long and 1 to 2&nbsp;cm (3/8&ndash;3/4&nbsp;in) thick, with a swollen, ragged, sac-like white [[volva (mycology)|volva]] (base).<ref name="Bresinsky"/> As the volva, which may be hidden by leaf litter, is a distinctive and diagnostic feature, it is important to remove some debris to check for it.<ref name="Jord108">Jordan & Wheeler. p108</ref>

The smell has been described as initially faint and honey-sweet but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable.<ref name="Zeitl61">Zeitlmayr. p61</ref> Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a [[universal veil]], which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The [[spore print]] is white, a common feature of ''Amanita''. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] (0.3&ndash;0.4&nbsp;[[Thou (unit of length)|mil]]) long, and stain blue with [[iodine]].<ref name="Zeitl61"/> The gills, on the other hand, are seen to stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Michael|year=1995|title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe|publisher=David & Charles|pages=198|id=ISBN 0-7153-0129-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=California Fungi: Amanita phalloides | publisher=MykoWeb.com | url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Amanita_phalloides.html | accessdate=June 01 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

It is [[ectomycorrhizally]] associated with a number of tree species. In Europe, these include a large number of [[hardwood]] and, less frequently, [[conifer]] species.

==Toxicity==
[[Image:Death Cap Mushroom.jpg|thumb|right|Warning sign in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]]]

As the common name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and it is responsible for the majority of fatal [[mushroom poisoning]]s worldwide.<ref name="benjamin200">Benjamin.p200</ref>  It is estimated that 30&nbsp;[[gram]]s (1&nbsp;oz), or half a cap, of this mushroom is enough to kill a human.<ref name="benjamin211">Benjamin.p211</ref> In 2006, a family of three in [[Poland]] was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants.<ref>{{pl icon}} {{cite journal|first=J.|last=Pawlowska|coauthors=Pawlak J, Kamiski A, Hevelke P, Jankowska I, Teisseyre M, Szymczak M, Kaliciiski P, Krawczyk M.| year=2006|title=(''Amanita phalloides'' poisoning as an indication for liver transplantation in three family members.)| journal=Wiadomości Lekarskie| volume=59|issue=1–2|pages=131-4| pmid=16646310}}</ref> Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid touching them.<ref name="Jord99"/><ref>{{cite book | author = Carluccio A | year = 2003 | title = The Complete Mushroom Book | publisher = Quadrille | location = London|pages = 224| id = ISBN 1-84400-040-0}}</ref> Furthermore, the toxicity is not [[Thermostability|reduced by cooking]], freezing, or drying.

===Similarity to edible species===
Recent cases highlight the issue of the similarity of ''A. phalloides'' to the [[edible mushroom|edible]] paddy straw mushroom, ''[[Volvariella volvacea]]'', with east- and southeast-Asian immigrants in Australia and the west coast of the United States falling victim. In an episode in [[Oregon]], four members of a [[Korea]]n family required liver transplants.<ref name="benjamin198">Benjamin.p198–199</ref> Of the seven people poisoned in the [[Canberra]] region between 1988 and 1998, three were from [[Laos]].<ref name="trim99">{{cite journal |author=Trim Geoffrey M.

In Europe, other similarly green-capped species collected by mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills of the genus ''[[Russula]]'' and the formerly popular ''[[Tricholoma flavovirens]]'', now regarded as hazardous owing to a series of restaurant poisonings in [[France]]. Brittlegills, such as ''[[Russula heterophylla]]'', ''[[Russula aeruginea|R. aeruginea]]'', and ''[[Russula virescens|R. virescens]]'', can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of both volva and ring.<ref name="Zeitl62">Zeitlmayr. p62</ref> Other similar species include ''[[Amanita subjunquillea|A. subjunquillea]]'' in eastern [[Asia]] and ''[[Amanita arocheae|A. arocheae]]'', which ranges from Andean [[Colombia]] north at least as far as central [[Mexico]], both of which are also poisonous.

===Biochemistry===
The species is now known to contain two main groups of toxins, both [[Cyclic compound|multicyclic]] (ring-shaped) [[peptide]]s, spread throughout the mushroom [[Thallus (tissue)|tissue]]: the [[amatoxin]]s and the [[phallotoxin]]s. Another toxin is [[phallolysin]], which has shown some [[haemolysis|hemolytic]] (red blood cell–destroying) activity ''in vitro''. An unrelated compound, [[antamanide]], has also been isolated.

Amatoxins consist of at least eight compounds with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by [[Heinrich Otto Wieland|Heinrich O. Wieland]] and Rudolf Hallermayer of the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|University of Munich]].<ref name="Litten75"/> Of the amatoxins, [[α-amanitin]] is the chief component and along with [[β-amanitin]] is likely responsible for the toxic effects.<ref name="Koppel">{{cite journal |author=Köppel C |title=Clinical symptomatology and management of mushroom poisoning |journal=Toxicon |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1513–40 |year=1993 |pmid=8146866 |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(93)90337-I}}</ref><ref name="dart">{{cite book |last=Dart| first= RC |chapter=Mushrooms |title=Medical toxicology |publisher=Williams & Wilkins| location=Philadelphia |year=2004|pages=1719–35| isbn=0-7817-2845-2}}</ref> Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of [[RNA polymerase II]], a vital enzyme in the synthesis of [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), [[microRNA]], and small nuclear RNA ([[snRNA]]).

The phallotoxins consist of at least seven compounds, all of which have seven similar peptide rings.

Up to the mid-20th century, the mortality rate was around 60–70%, but this has greatly improved with advances in medical care. A review of death cap poisoning throughout Europe from 1971 to 1980 found the overall mortality rate to be 22.4% (51.3% in children under ten and 16.5% in those older than ten).<ref name="Floer82">{{de icon}}{{cite journal| last=Floerscheim| first=G.L.| Coauthors=O.

===Treatment===
Consumption of the death cap is a [[medical emergency]] requiring hospitalization. There are four main categories of therapy for poisoning: preliminary medical care, supportive measures, specific treatments, and [[liver transplantation]].<ref name="Enjalbert">{{cite journal |author=Enjalbert F, Rapior S, Nouguier-Soulé J, Guillon S, Amouroux N, Cabot C |title=Treatment of amatoxin poisoning: 20-year retrospective analysis |journal=Journal of Toxicology - Clinical Toxicology |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=715-57 |year=2002 |pmid=12475187}}</ref>

Preliminary care consists of gastric decontamination with either [[activated carbon]] or [[gastric lavage]]. However, due to the delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment many hours after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions.<ref name="Enjalbert"/><ref name="Vesconi">{{cite journal |author=Vesconi S, Langer M, Iapichino G, Costantino D, Busi C, Fiume L |title=Therapy of cytotoxic mushroom intoxication |journal=Critical care medicine |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=402-6 |year=1985 |pmid=3987318}}</ref> Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of [[metabolic acidosis]], hypoglycemia, [[electrolyte]] imbalances, and impaired coagulation.<ref name="Enjalbert"/>

==Notable victims==
Several historical figures may have died from ''Amanita phalloides'' poisoning (or other similar, toxic ''Amanitas''). These were either accidental poisonings or [[assassination]] plots. Alleged victims of this kind of poisoning include Roman Emperor [[Claudius]], [[Pope Clement VII]], Tsaritsa [[Natalia Naryshkina]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]].<ref name=wasson>{{cite journal|last=Wasson|first=Robert Gordon| year=1972| title=The death of Claudius, or mushrooms for murderers|journal=Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University| volume=23| issue=3|pages=101–128|issn=0006-8098}}</ref>

[[R. Gordon Wasson]] recounted the details of these deaths, noting the likelihood of ''Amanita'' poisoning. In the case of Clement VII, the illness that led to his death lasted some five months, making the case clearly inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning. Natalia Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. However, it is unclear whether the mushrooms themselves were poisonous or whether she succumbed to [[food poisoning]].<ref name=wasson/>

{{Rquote|right|'''''Ce plat de champignons a changé la destinée de l’Europe.'''''<br /><br /> ("This dish of mushrooms changed the destiny of Europe.")|Voltaire|[http://www.voltaire-integral.com/Html/01/07MEMOIR.html Mémoires].}}

Charles VI experienced [[indigestion]] after eating a dish of [[Sautéing|sautéed]] mushrooms. This led to an illness from which he died ten days later — symptomology consistent with amatoxin poisoning. Charles' death led to the [[War of Austrian Succession]]. Noted [[Voltaire]], "this dish of mushrooms changed the destiny of Europe."<ref name="benjamin35">Benjamin.p35</ref><ref name=wasson/>

The case of the Claudius poisoning is more complex. It is known that Claudius was very fond of eating ''[[Amanita caesarea|Caesar's mushroom]]''. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. However, ancient authors such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]] are unanimous about there having been poison added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculates that the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of [[colocynth]] being administered later during his illness.<ref name="benjamin33">Benjamin.p33–34</ref><ref name=wasson/>
