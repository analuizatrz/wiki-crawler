'''''The Ordertaker''''' is a single by [[Philippines|Filipino]] Novelty Rock band Parokya ni Edgar, also featuring [[Kamikazee]].  The song is a parody of "[[Chop Suey!]]" and "[[Toxicity (song)|Toxicity]]" by the U.S. band [[System of a Down]].  The melody follows a simpler version of [[Chop Suey]]'s progression, the story of a man who cannot order at a restaurant because he has no menu, listing all of the different foods that he would like to eat. The name ''The Ordertaker'' is a parody of [[WWE Roster|WWE Wrestler]] [[Mark Calaway|The Undertaker]].

==Video==

The video starts vocalist Chito Miranda, wearing the clothes that he wore in the music video for Picha Pie. [[Kamikazee]] and [[Parokya ni Edgar]] proceed to spoof several wrestlers (The Ordertaker, parody of [[Mark Calaway|The Undertaker]] and Adonis 3:16, parody of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]). Chito Miranda parodies [[The Ultimate Warrior]], while Vinci Montaner is missing in action (he's in the wanted print ad).

==Trivia==
*When the customer gets angry because there was no food, he transformed to The Ordertaker, Hulk-style.
*Another reference to Hulk are the opening words "Don't make me hungry. You don't like me when I'm hungry." which replaces "angry" with "hungry".
*The main plot parodies both WWE and the Monty Python Cheese Shop sketch.
