'''Brigadeiro''' is a simple [[Brazil]]ian [[chocolate]] candy created in the 1940s, and named after Brigadeiro  (Brigadier) [[Eduardo Gomes]], and its shape is reminiscent of that of some varieties of [[chocolate truffle]]s. The candy is usually served at parties and is very popular among both children and adults. It is almost like a national mania, being probably the most popular candy in the country.

It is made by mixing [[condensed milk]], butter and chocolate powder together. The mixture is then heated in a pan on the stove or in a microwave or [[hob]] to obtain a smooth, sticky texture. If made on the stove, it is ready when the mixture doesn't stick to the bottom when the pan is tilted. 

There are two ways to serve brigadeiro. The traditional method is to roll the candy into balls which are then covered in chocolate or coffee-flavored sprinkles; that is the way brigadeiros are served in parties. The second method is to leave the candy slightly more fluid and to eat it with a [[spoon]], which is how people usually eat at home. Although it is not common in Brazil, a dash of [[rum]] or [[brandy]] can also be added to the recipe to give it a rich taste similar to a [[tartufo]] [[tiramisu]].

Brigadeiro can also be used as a topping or covering for cakes, brownies, and fruits. 

==History==

Eduardo Gomes was a [[Brazilian Air Force]] [[brigadier]] (thus the title "Brigadeiro," in Portuguese), who first gained notoriety for playing a part in quashing a communist coup in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Later he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in [[1946]] and [[1950]]. This was a time of shortage of traditional imports such as nuts and fruits because of the war. But, at the same time, [[Nestlé]] was introducing its chocolate powder in the country.

Although Brazil is a major producer of [[cocoa bean]]s, it is believed that the creation and success of the candy was a combination of opportunities: the [[multinational corporation]] Nestlé, which introduced chocolate powder; the creators who named it after a famous politician, the need to find a replacement to imported sweets; and its ease of manufacture.
