==Film career==
Madhavan was a popular face in Indian television even before he made his maiden film debut. He acted in [[Hindi]] television serials like ''Saaya'', ''Sea Hawks'', ''Banegi Apni Baat'', and ''Ghar Jamai'' in minor and brief roles<ref name="SER">{{cite news|url=http://tvguide.indiatimes.com/articlelist/246503.cms
|publisher=Unplugged TV Guide|title= I have always broken the Rules:Madhavan|date=Oct 18, 2006
}}</ref>. His debut in movies came in the form of ''[[Relax (film)|Shanti Shanti Shanti]]'', a [[Kannada]] movie also starring [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] and [[Prakash Raj]]. The film performed well at the Kannada box-office but when it was dubbed it lowered Madhavan's status in the [[tamil film]] industry after [[Alaipayuthey]].
In 1997, Madhavan had auditioned for a part in the critically-acclaimed movie, ''[[Iruvar]]''<ref name="MNU">{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2000/mar/08madh.htm
|publisher=Rediff|title= People remember Scenes, not episodes|date=Oct 18, 2006
}}</ref> starring [[Mohanlal]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] and directed by [[Mani Ratnam]]. Mani Ratnam was pleased with Madhavan's capabilities but wanted a senior actor to play Madhavan's part, so Mani Ratnam confirmed Madhavan could be a part of his next project as a sorry plea.  

He got his first big break when [[Mani Ratnam]] introduced Madhavan to [[Kollywood|Tamil Cinema]] through the film ''[[Alaipayuthey]]''. Produced by [[Madras Talkies]], it was a musical fairy tale of the intricate relationships after marriage. He was paired with [[Shalini Kumar]]. The film grossed over Rs.50 million at the box office and became Madhavan's first blockbuster in Kollywood.

His next highly-anticipated second film, ''[[Ennavale]]'' starring [[Sneha]] and dwelling on the subject of diasability flopped but [[Gautham Menon]]'s debut venture, ''[[Minnale]]'' became his second surprise blockbuster. ''[[Minnale]]'' explored the views of college enemies vying for a love after a decade without contact. The film grossed over Rs.100 million at the box office. The music also was a huge hit rendered by debutant, [[Harris Jayaraj]]. [[Gautham Menon]] and Madhavan then remade this in [[Bollywood]] as ''[[Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein]]'' with [[Diya Mirza]] and [[Saif Ali Khan]].

[[Madras Talkies]]'s hit production ''[[Dumm Dumm Dumm]]'' with [[Jyothika Saravanan]] was then followed by veteran director [[K. Balachandar]]'s 100th film, ''[[Parthale Paravasam]]'' with [[Simran (actress)|Simran Bagga]] and [[Sneha]]. Despite a big opening and high expectations, it only managed reasonable business at the box-office. However his third and final blockbuster ''[[Run (film)|Run]]'' was a landmark film for Madhavan as it won him ''[[Filmfare Best Actor Award South]]'' in the [[Filmfare Awards South]] ceremony. ''Run'', directed by Linguswamy told the simple story of a brother opposing his sister's love. The film grossed over Rs.200 million at the box office and the Kollywood trade began comparing Madhavan with long established superstars like [[Ajith]] and [[Vijay]].

The Hindi version starred [[Atul Kulkarni]] as the elder brother and National Award winner, [[Meera Jasmine]] debuted as Madhavan's lady love. [[Mani Ratnam]] chose Madhavan again with [[Simran (actress)|Simran Bagga]] in the critically acclaimed blockbuster, ''[[Kannathil Muthamittal]]'', which explored the views of an adopted  child affected in war-torn [[Sri Lanka]]. He then had a second attempt at [[Bollywood]] with the multi-starrer, ''[[Dil Vil Pyar Vyar]]'' but once again his Hindi film flopped. His next project, ''[[Anbe Sivam]]'' with [[Kamal Haasan]] did well at the box-office. It was labelled by many as one of the finest films made and his co-star, [[Kamal Haasan]] received particular praise for his infamous portrayal of a street campaigner. 

[[Image:Anbesivam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kamal Haasan]] and Madhavan as depicted in the film, ''[[Anbe Sivam]]'']]
R. Madhavan's following film projects such as [[Vikraman]]'s ''[[Priyamana Thozhi]]'' with [[Jyothika Saravanan]], [[Saran (director)|Saran]]'s ''[[Jay Jay]]'' with [[Pooja Umashankar]], [[Reema Sen]] and [[Nisha Kothari]] and [[K. S. Ravikumar]]'s ''[[Aethiree]]'' with [[Sadha]] all didn't receive good collections at the box-office demoting Madhavan's prestige in the industry. Madhavan was criticized for ignoring the stories of the films and just playing the lead role in them. Eventhough ''[[Priyamana Thozhi]]'' was directed by [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment|National Award]] winner, [[Vikraman]], the film received a poor opening and the film lost out. The film told the story of two friends who were mistaken for lovers. ''[[Jay Jay]]'', directed by [[Saran (director)|Saran]] in which he was paired with then debutants, [[Pooja Umashankar]] and [[Nisha Kothari]], only did average business. ''[[Aethiree]]'' directed by noted director, [[K. S. Ravikumar]] opposite [[Sadha]] and [[Kanika (actress)|Kanika]] despite being a musical hit flopped at the box-office. Madhavan then teamed up with [[Nassar]] to act in a English film entitled ''[[Nothing But Life]]'' which was played at various International Film Festivals around [[Asia]].

Madhavan has since come back with successful projects such as in the multi-starrer ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]'', also directed by Mani Ratnam, where he played an off-beat negative role as a fighter for a politician. Madhavan won the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award South]] for the portrayal of the character Inba, which was played by [[Abhishek Bachchan]] in [[Yuva]], the [[Bollywood]] remake. He had continued his success at the box-office with hits such as ''[[Priyasakhi]]'', a family orientated film with [[Sadha]] which became the first film to be the first Tamil film to be dubbed into [[Zulu]]. After approximately 8 months, off the screen, he came back with ''[[Thambi]]'' as a [[Mahatma Gandhi]]-[[Subash Chandra Bose]] figure who sacrifces his life to stop growing forms of violence.  He has since boosted his chances in [[Bollywood]] with the role of Ajay Rathod in the Hindi blockbuster, ''[[Rang de Basanti]]'' which was sent in as [[India]]'s official entry to the Oscars. His next movie ''[[Rendu]]'' saw him play his debut double-role, in which he played a blind in a role. The film is heading for a Golden Jubilee Run in several theatres in [[Chennai]], the film's shoots were completed within two months. His latest project released on [[January 12]] is [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]'', which he stars along with [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[Aishwarya Rai]], [[Vidya Balan]] and [[Mallika Sherawat]]. In Guru, he played the role of an antagonist who opposes the ideas of the character played by [[Abhishek Bachchan]]. The film also contained Madhavan's first on-screen kiss with [[Vidya Balan]]. The film opened well to gain rave reviews from critics.

Madhavan has several projects which are forthcoming. Forthcoming projects in the shooting faze include ''[[Arya (film)|Arya]]'' alongside [[Bhavana Balachandran]], ''[[Evano Oruvan]]'' a remake of a popular [[Marathi]] film co-starring with [[Sangeetha]] and being produced by the Hindi directors, [[Abbas Burmawalla]] and [[Mustan Burmawalla]], in which Madhavan is also writing the dialogues and he also has a [[Hindi]]-[[Bengali]] bilingual, ''[[Sunglass (film)|Sunglass]]'' co-starring [[Konkona Sen Sharma]], [[Jaya Bachchan]] and [[Raima Sen]]. Madhavan has also signed up to two [[Ram Gopal Varma]] production films, the first being ''[[Darling (2007 film)|Darling]]'' in which he is paired with [[Shriya Saran]] and [[Shriya Reddy]] and he also has ''Yaaravan Nalam'' a [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-[[Hindi]] bilingual which is to take off late in 2007. ''[[Sarvam]]'' directed by [[Vishnuvardhan]] has also been confirmed to contain Madhavan in the lead role with [[Hansika Motwani]]. Another film in the waiting is Seeman's ''[[Pagalavan]]'' will give Madhavan a strong character like the one in ''[[Thambi]]''. He has also given call sheets for films titled ''[[Nee Indri]]'' produced by Prathap Pothan set to pair with him with [[Trisha Krishnan]], ''[[Vaazhthukal]]'' with Seeman for the third time, ''[[Bombay High (film)|Bombay High]]'', a [[Hindi]] film paired with [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] and he will appear in a guest role in the film, ''[[Delhii Heights]]'' as himself under the [[Sivaji Ganesan]] banner.

He took part in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s stage show, ''[[Netru, Indru, Naalai]]'' in [[2006]] alongside many other co-stars to show his signal of thanks to his mentor, who had introduced him into the industry. He recently hosted the third season of ''[[Deal Ya No Deal]]'' on Doodarshan TV.

==Game Host==

{{main|Deal Ya No Deal}}
[[Image:ManmadhaMatjhavan.jpg|right|thumb|Madhavan as shown presenting, ''[[Deal Ya No Deal]]'']]
R. Madhavan was announced as the host of [[Sony]] Entertainment Television's ''[[Deal Ya No Deal]]'' in [[October 2005]] with a payment of Rs. 10 million per separate series. The show was being produced by Miditech, in association with Endemol BV. Deal Ya No Deal is a game show, testing the participant for speed, reflexes, wit, cunning and gaming skills. The contestant may win up to Rs. 10 million in a show. The contestant faces 22 cash boxes, containing cheques varying from a small amounts to Rs 10 million. Without knowing the contents, the contestant picks a single sealed box, for themselves to keep until the end of the show. It premièred on [[November 23]], 2005 on Sony Entertainment Television and aired on three nights each week. The first series had a set similar to the [[UK]] version, and the theme song and music cues were the same as those used in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version. Contestants held the cases. There is a top prize of 1 crore rupees ($10 million), and the lowest prize was a breath freshener, called a Chlor-mint.

Madhavan quit as the lead anchor of the game show, [[Deal Ya No Deal]] in [[January 2006]]. Madhavan claimed he was unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house. According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had made it clear that he would continue with his [[Kollywood|South film]] assignments, and as the show was being filmed in [[Mumbai]], he had found it hard to keep travelling throughout India from [[Chennai]] to film the ten days a month he had signed up for. The ever-changing look of the show meant Madhavan had to constantly rehearse. Madhavan also added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him with fatigue.
 
There were also some testing times, like when he shot for the show immediately after the funeral of his grandfather, when there was a celebrity special. [[Mandira Bedi]] replaced Madhavan as the anchor in [[February]] for Series 2 of the game show. Since then she has also left the set-up for personal unconfirmed reasons. He was also one of the guest judges in the Indian television show, [[Fame Gurukul]] which ended on 20 October 2005.

==Mobile Gaming Character==

A [[Mumbai]] based game development company, [[Paradox]] signed a worldwide contract Madhavan to create six mobile-based games based on him and his film roles. While launching the first game, ''Madhavan's MiG'' in [[Chennai]], Madhavan expressed his delight at being involved in projects aimed at young people. The 'paper-player' model would cost Rs 5 per download, while a one-time download would range from Rs.50-99, he said. The games, which consists of three levels, would be available on [[Reliance]], [[Idea]] and [[Spice]] mobile services. 

''Madhavan's MIG'' game will feature the actor make a reprise of his Rang De Basanti pilot role and the game will be based around basic steering of the planes. In the other game titled ''Madhavan'', the player will have to help the actor get to the premiere of his latest movie evading the paparazzi. Paradox has been developing games for wireless devices, apart from single and multi-player games for PC, web and allied platforms since 2001. Madhavan said the concept of couple of the games had been derived from his role of a pilot in the recent Hindi blockbuster, [[Rang De Basanti]], in which he flew an MiG 29 aircraft.
