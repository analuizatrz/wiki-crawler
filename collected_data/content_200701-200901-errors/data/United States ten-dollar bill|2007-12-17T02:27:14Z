The '''United States ten-dollar bill''' ($10) is a [[Denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[United States dollar|United States currency]].  [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] is currently featured on the [[obverse]] of the bill, while the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] is featured on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]. (Hamilton is one of two non-presidents featured on currently issued U.S. bills. The other is [[Benjamin Franklin]], on the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]].) All $10 bills issued today are [[Federal Reserve Note]]s.

The [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] says the "average life" of a $10 bill in circulation is 18 months before it is replaced due to wear. Approximately 11% of all newly printed US [[banknote]]s are $10 bills.  Ten dollar bills are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks in yellow straps.

The source of the face on the $10 bill is [[John Trumbull]]’s 1805 portrait of Hamilton that belongs to the portrait collection of [[New York City Hall]].  The $10 bill is the only U.S. paper currency in circulation in which the portrait faces to the left (the [[Large denominations of United States currency|$100,000 bill]] features a portrait of [[Woodrow Wilson]] facing to the left, but it is no longer in circulation).

''(<small>approximately</small> 7.4218 × 3.125 in ≅ 189 × 79 mm)''

*[[1861]]: The first $10 bill was issued as a [[Demand Note]] with a small portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]] on the left side of the obverse and an [[allegorical]] figure representing art on the right.
*[[1862]]: The first $10 [[United States Note]] was issued with a face design similar to the 1861 Demand Note; the reverse, however, was somewhat revised.
*[[1863]]: [[Interest Bearing Note]]s, featuring a portrait of [[Salmon P. Chase]] and vignette of liberty, were issued that could be redeemed one year after the date printed on the bill for $10 plus 5% interest. The notes could also be spent for exactly $10.
*[[1864]]: [[Compound Interest Treasury Note]]s, with a face design similar to the 1863 Interest Bearing Note, were issued that grew in face value 6% compounded semi-annually. It is unknown if the note could actually be spent for $10 plus interest.
*[[1869]]: A new $10 United States Note was issued with a portrait of [[Daniel Webster]] on the left and an allegorical representation of [[Pocahontas]] being presented to the Royal Court of England on the right side of the obverse. This note is nicknamed a "jackass note" because the eagle on the front looks like a donkey when the note is turned upside down.
*[[1870]]: [[National Gold Bank Note]]s, featuring a vignette of [[Benjamin Franklin]] flying a kite on the left and liberty and an eagle on the right, were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by participating national banks. The back of the bill featured a vignette of US gold coins.
*[[1875]]: The 1869 United States Note was revised. The blue and green tinting that was present on the obverse was removed and the design on the reverse was completely changed.
*[[1878]]: The first $10 [[Silver Certificate]] was issued with a portrait of [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]] on the left side of the obverse. The reverse, unlike any other federally issued note, was printed in '''black''' ink and featured the word <small>SILVER</small> in large block letters.
*[[1879]]: [[Refunding Certificate]]s were issued that paid 4% interest annually.

*[[1886]]: A new $10 silver certificate with a portrait of [[Thomas A. Hendricks]] was issued.
*[[1890]]: Ten dollar Treasury or "Coin Notes" were issued and given for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of General [[Philip Sheridan]].  The reverse featured an ornate design that took up almost the entire note.
*[[1891]]: The reverse of the 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too "busy" which would make it too easy to [[counterfeit]]. 
*[[1901]]: The famous United States Note featuring portraits of [[Meriwether Lewis]] on the left, [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] on the right, and Black Diamond, an [[American Bison]], was issued.  This United States Note was the only one to mention the legal provision that authorized its issuance. The reverse featured an allegorical figure representing [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]] between two [[Roman architecture|Roman]]-styled pillars.
*[[1907]]: Congress officially ended the interest paid on Refunding Certificates, forever making the their face value $21.30.
*[[1907]]: The first $10 [[Gold Certificate]] with a portrait of [[Michael Hillegas]] on the front and orange-colored back was issued.
*[[1914]]: The first $10 [[Federal Reserve Note]] was issued with a portrait of [[Andrew Jackson]] on the obverse and vignettes of [[farming]] and [[industry]] on the reverse. The note initially had a red [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|treasury seal]] and serial numbers; however, they were changed to blue. 
*[[1915]]: [[Federal Reserve Bank Note]]s (not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes) were issued by 4 individual Federal Reserve banks. The obverse was similar to the 1914 Federal Reserve notes except for large wording in the middle of the bill and a portrait with no border on the left side of the bill. Each note was an obligation of the issuing bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank.
*[[1918]]: The 1915 Federal Reserve Bank Note was re-issued under series of 1918 by 4 Federal Reserve banks.
*[[1923]]: The $10 United States Note was redesigned with a portrait of Andrew Jackson. Some of the design aspects of this note, such as the bottom border and numeral 10 overprinted with the word <small>TEN</small>, were transferred over to the series of 1928 $10 bill.

==Small size note history==
''(6.14 × 2.61 in ≅ 156 × 66 mm)''
*[[1929]]: Under series of [[1928]], all U.S. currency was changed to its current size. All variations of the $10 bill would carry the same portrait of Alexander Hamilton, same border design on the [[obverse]], and the same [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] with a vignette of the U.S. Treasury building. The $10 bill was issued as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green seal and serial numbers and as a [[Gold Certificate]] with a golden seal and serial numbers.  Contrary to popular belief, the car parked outside of the Treasury Department building is not a [[Ford Model T]], but rather a composite of multiple cars of that era.
*[[1933]]: As an emergency response to the [[Great Depression]], additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes. This was the only small-sized $10 bill that had a different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.
*[[1933]]: The first small sized $10 [[Silver Certificate]]s were issued with a blue seal and serial numbers. The obverse had a similar design style to the 1928 $1 Silver Certificates; however, phrasing on the $10 bill was different from the $1 bill. This issue, with the series date of 1933, was not widely released into general circulation. Surviving examples of these notes usually sell for $10,000 to $30,000 in the numismatic community depending on the condition of the paper.
*[[1934]]: The $10 Silver Certificate was redesigned with a blue numeral 10 on the left side of the obverse and the treasury seal printed over the gray word <small>TEN</small> on the right. Phrasing on the certificate was changed to reflect the [[Silver Purchase Act of 1934]].

*[[1934]]: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].
*[[1942]]: Special [[World War II]] currency was issued. <small>HAWAII</small> was overprinted on the front and back of the $10 Federal Reserve Note, and the seal and serial numbers were changed to brown.  This was done so that the currency could be declared worthless in case of [[Japan]]ese invasion. A $10 Silver Certificate was printed with a yellow instead of blue treasury seal; these notes were given to U.S. troops in North Africa. These notes, too, could be declared worthless if seized by the enemy.
*[[1950]]: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $10 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word <small>TEN</small>, and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around it.
*[[1953]]: The $10 silver certificate had several design changes analogous to the 1950 Federal Reserve Note design changes; also, the blue numeral 10 on the left side of the bill was changed to gray.
*[[1963]]: <small>WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND</small> was removed from the obverse and <small>IN GOD WE TRUST</small> was added to the reverse of the 1963 Federal Reserve Notes. Also, the obligation was changed to its current wording, <small>THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE</small>.
*[[1969]]: The $10 bill began using the new treasury seal with wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].
*[[1990]]: The first modern anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced with microscopic printing around Hamilton's portrait and a plastic security strip on the left side of the bill.  
*[[May 24]] [[2000]]: To combat evolving [[counterfeit]]ing, a new $10 bill was issued under series [[1999]] whose design was similar in style to the $100, $50, and $20 bills that had all undergone previous design changes. The major changes were a revised portrait of Hamilton and a revised vignette of the U.S. Treasury building. The plastic security strip reads "USA 10" and now glows yellow under a  [[black light]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
*[[2001]]-[[2004]]: Various members of the [[United States Congress]] introduced bills that would replace the portrait of Hamilton with a portrait of [[Ronald Reagan]].  None of the bills were enacted.
*The newest $10 bill entered circulation on [[March 2]] [[2006]]. In addition to design changes introduced in 2000, the obverse features red background images of the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s torch, the phrase <small>WE THE PEOPLE</small> from the [[United States Constitution]], a smaller metallic representation of the Statue of Liberty's torch, orange and yellow background color, a border-less portrait of Hamilton, and to the left of Hamilton small yellow 10s whose zeros form the [[EURion constellation]]. The reverse features small yellow EURion 10s and have the fine lines removed from around the vignette of the United States Treasury building.''

New York City band [[Cop Shoot Cop]] included a song called "Ten Dollar Bill" on their 1993 major-label debut "[[Ask Questions Later]]."

==Nicknames==
The $10 bill has several nicknames, including:
*'''Sawbuck''', based on the resemblance of the [[Roman numeral]] "X" on some of the earlier designs to the [[Sawbuck|carpentry device]] of the same name. This usage is far less common today than it was in the early [[20th century]].
*'''Hamilton''', '''Alex''', '''Al''' or '''Alexander''' based on the use of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s portrait
*'''Tenner''', borrowed from British reference to the 10-pound note, is rarely used in the US but generally understood.
*'''Ten Spot'''
*'''Ten'''
