'''State Highway 7''', often abbreviated as '''OK-7''' or '''SH-7''', is a 150-mile<ref name="okhighways">{{okhighways|7|2007-03-24}}</ref> (242 km) highway in southern [[Oklahoma]]. This lengthy highway connects many towns in Oklahoma's "[[Little Dixie]]" area. It runs from [[Interstate 44]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]] to U.S. [[U.S. Route 69|69]]/[[U.S. Route 75|U.S. 75]] in [[Atoka, Oklahoma|Atoka]].

==Route description==
[[Image:177us_ok7.jpg|thumb|right|OK-7 shield in Sulphur.]]
From its western terminus at the interchange with Interstate 44 and Lee Boulevard in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]], OK-7 is a multilane highway. It runs due east from Lawton for ten miles before intersecting [[State Highway 65 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 65]] in the unincorporated community of [[Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma|Pumpkin Center]]. It continues due east for 14 more miles, bypassing the town of [[Central High, Oklahoma|Central High]], before meeting [[U.S. Route 81|U.S. 81]] north of [[Duncan, Oklahoma|Duncan]]. 

For many years, this 24-mile section of OK-7 from Lawton to U.S. 81 was one of the longest straight sections of highway in Oklahoma without a single curve.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} That changed somewhat in the 1990s when slight reverse curve was added when the highway was upgraded to a four-lane divided highway in the vicinity of the Big Beaver Creek bridge near Pumpkin Center in Comanche County in order to preserve a historic farmhouse dating back to early Oklahoma history that would otherwise have been in the path of the highway expansion project.

OK-7 and U.S. 81 are duplexed for 6 miles through [[Duncan, Oklahoma|Duncan]], after which the state highway splits off to the east once again, still as a multilane highway, though it falls to a two-lane road after a few miles. Next the highway passes through the town of [[Velma, Oklahoma|Velma]] before meeting [[State Highway 76 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 76]] in [[Ratliff City, Oklahoma|Ratliff City]]. The southern section of [[State Highway 74 (Oklahoma)|OK-74]], which roughly mirrors SH-76's path, has its southern terminus at OK-7 seven miles later, near [[Tatums, Oklahoma|Tatums]]. 

After crossing [[Interstate 35]], OK-7 becomes a multilane highway once again. Three miles later, it meets [[U.S. Route 77|U.S. 77]] near [[Davis, Oklahoma|Davis]]. On the other side of Davis, OK-7 is the northern terminus of [[State Highway 110 (Oklahoma)|OK-110]], a connector route to the town of [[Dougherty, Oklahoma|Dougherty]]. Two miles west of Sulphur, the highway connects to the southern terminus of the [[Chickasaw Turnpike]], a toll highway to [[Ada, Oklahoma|Ada]]. After passing through [[Sulphur, Oklahoma|Sulphur]] (where it has a brief duplex with [[U.S. Route 177|U.S. 177]]), OK-7 travels six more miles, where it meets [[State Highway 1 (Oklahoma)|Highway 1]].

For ten miles, OK-7 and OK-1 are duplexed, through the town of [[Mill Creek, Oklahoma|Mill Creek]]. This duplex ends three miles south of Mill Creek, where it serves the unincorporated community of [[Reagan, Oklahoma|Reagan]] and the Slippery Falls Boy Scout Ranch. It shares a one-mile triplex with [[U.S. Route 377|U.S. 377]]/[[State Highway 99 (Oklahoma)|OK-99]]. Thirteen miles east of the triplex, it serves the town of [[Wapanucka, Oklahoma]], where it intersects [[State Highway 48 (Oklahoma)|OK-48]]. Seventeen miles later, it ends at U.S. 75 in [[Atoka]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}
OK-7 is a former border to border east-west state highway across southern Oklahoma whose western terminus was at the [[Texas]] border west of [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]] and eastern terminus at the [[Arkansas]] border east of [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma|Broken Bow]].<ref name="okhighways"/> OK-7's route was truncated on its eastern and western sections during the 1960s and 1970s as those were duplexed with [[U.S. Route 62|U.S. 62]] between the Texas border and [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]] and with [[U.S. Route 70|U.S. 70]] between Broken Bow and the Arkansas border.<ref name="roadklahoma">{{cite web|last=McMahon|first=Martin|url=http://roads.tulok.net/t-7.html|title=Terminus: SH-7|work=Roadklahoma|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> The eastern portion of OK-7 that was duplexed with U.S. 70 between Broken Bow and the Arkansas border was truncated in 1963 to its junction with U.S. 70 in Broken Bow. The western section of OK-7 duplexed with U.S. 62 was truncated in 1971 to the intersection of Cache Road (U.S. 62) and Sheridan Road in Lawton following the upgrading of U.S. 62 between Lawton and [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]] into a multilane expressway which included extensive realignments and bypassing of cities and towns along the old duplexed U.S. 62/OK-7 alignment including [[Cache, Oklahoma|Cache]], [[Indiahoma, Oklahoma|Indiahoma]], [[Snyder, Oklahoma|Snyder]], and [[Headrick, Oklahoma|Headrick]]. Almost all of the original OK-7/U.S. 62 alignment from Lawton to Headrick (including the U.S. 62 Business route in Snyder) still exists today as a local/county road with original 1930s concrete surfacing still intact from west of Cache through Indiahoma to east of Snyder and from the North Fork of Red River bridge through Headrick to its intersection with the current four-lane U.S. 62 west of Headrick. This section of old OK-7/U.S. 62 includes several 1920s/1930s vintage bridges with Oklahoma's then-common concrete fence post railing and truss bridges of both the pony- and through-truss variety. One of those old bridges includes the 3/4-mile pony-truss structure over the North Fork of the Red River between Snyder and Headrick that was built in 1928 and is situated on the boundaries of three counties: Kiowa, Jackson and Tillman counties (The current four-lane U.S. 62 bridge to the north and its alignment is entirely in Kiowa and Jackson counties).

Along still-intact sections of OK-7, major route changes through the years include a relocation in [[Duncan, Oklahoma|Duncan]] during the early 1950s, when the original route along Main Street through the downtown area was moved south of the business district along Bois D'Arc Avenue from U.S. 81 eastward to tie in with the original Main Street route on Duncan's east side, which became OK-7 Alternate and now designated as OK-7 Business. In 1969, the main Bois D'Arc Avenue alignment in Duncan was relocated slightly to the south and the rerouting continued for some 20 miles from the OK-7/OK-7 Business junction to [[Velma, Oklahoma|Velma]] on a new and straighter alignment (including both multi-lane divided highway and two-lane roadway) that bypassed the old OK-7 alignment through the oil fields of eastern Stephens County along with the town of Velma. In the 1980s, the new OK-7 was extended east of Velma past the small community of County Line on the Stephens/Carter county line to west of [[Ratliff City, Oklahoma|Ratliff City]] in Carter County.

By 1985, the eastern terminus of OK-7 was pushed back to its intersection with OK-3 and U.S. 69/75 in [[Atoka, Oklahoma|Atoka]] when OK-7 was again truncated and lost its duplex with OK-3 from Atoka to Broken Bow. In 2003, OK-7s route through most of the Lawton city limits on Lee Boulevard and Sheridan Road was eliminated when the western terminus was pushed back to the I-44 interchange with Lee Boulevard on the east side of Lawton. Eliminated at the same time was a related OK-7 Alternate route in Lawton that followed Sheridan Road from the 1971-2003 western terminus of OK-7 at the Cache/Sheridan intersection north to the Sheridan Gate of the Fort Sill Military Reservation.

==Spurs==
SH-7 has two spur routes: 

* '''OK-7B''', also signed as '''Business OK-7''', is the original alignment of OK-7 through Duncan. 
* '''OK-7D''' is a 3.5 mile spur to the town of [[Bromide, Oklahoma|Bromide]].
