'''''The Age of Reason: Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology''''' is a [[deist]]ic critique of the [[Bible]] written by the [[18th Century|eighteenth-century]] British radical and American founding father [[Thomas Paine]].

==Historical context==
''The Age of Reason'' was written during 1794–5.  Paine wrote the first part of the book in [[France]] while he was imprisoned. Paine was in jail (and scheduled to be [[guillotined]]) for protesting the execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], so the first section was published in a French translation.  After his release from [[prison]] in November 1794, Paine wrote the second part at the urging of [[James Monroe]]. The completed work was published in 1795.

Paine fell out of favor with the public due to the publication of this book, and he was marginalized upon his return to America. Nonetheless, his treatise became quite influential in the history of the [[Skepticism|skeptical]], [[Rationalism|rationalist]], and [[Freethought|freethinking]] movements.
