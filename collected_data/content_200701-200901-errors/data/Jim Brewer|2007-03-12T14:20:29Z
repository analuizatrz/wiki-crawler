'''James Thomas (Jim) Brewer''' ([[November 17]], [[1937]] &ndash; [[November 16]], [[1987]]) was an American [[relief pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. From [[1960]] through [[1976]], Brewer played for the [[Chicago Cubs]] (1960-1963), [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1964-1975) and [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] (1975-1976). He batted and threw left-handed.

Following the wise advice of legendary [[Warren Spahn]], Brewer developed a nasty [[screwball]] to become one of the most successful relievers in the [[National League]] between the [[1960s]] and [[1970s|70s]]. 

A native of [[Merced, California]], Brewer compiled a 69-65 record with 810 [[strikeout]]s and a 3.07 [[earned run average|ERA]] in a 17-year career that began with the Cubs and ended with the Angels. But he is most remembered for his 12 seasons with the Dodgers. 

In his career, Brewer recorded 132 [[save (sport)|saves]], 125 of them with the Dodgers, appearing in 474 games for the club. Only two Dodgers pitchers, [[Don Sutton]] and [[Don Drysdale]], have more appearances â€“550 and 518, respectively.

As a Dodgers member, Brewer appeared in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1973 All-Star Game]] and in three [[World Series]] ([[1965 World Series|1965]]-[[1966 World Series|66]] and [[1974 World Series|1974]]). From [[1968 in sports|1968]]-[[1973 in sports|73]] he averaged 19.5 saves a season, with a career-high 24 in [[1970 in sports|1970]], and in [[1972 in sports|1972]], he posted an 1.26 ERA and averaged a significant 4.69 [[hits per nine innings]]. 

Brewer died in [[Tyler, Texas]], of injuries suffered in an automobile accident, just a day before his 50th birthday.
