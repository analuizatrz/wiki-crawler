'''Josiah Power''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Tom Grummett]], he first appears in Justice League #61/1.

==Fictional character biography==
The impressively tall, craggy featured Josiah Power was one of America’s best lawyers until his meta-gene was triggered during the alien [[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]] by the activation of the '''Gene Bomb'''.[http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=josiahpower] 

Following the untimely public activation of his metagene in the court room, corporate attorney Josiah Power was dismissed from his law firm. Power had litte interest in becoming a traditional costumed hero, but it became readily apparent that he could not continue to practice law without undue public attention. 

===Power Company===
Working his way through a short depression and other problems, Josiah eventually found a way to combine his old skills and newfound abilities. He decided to found a business of super-heroes for hire, structured like a law firm, with partners and associates.

He called his new team, the '''[[Power Company]]'''. During his tenure in the team, he was put into a coma from a gunshot wound and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] became an associate. He has since recovered and has continued active duty. Josiah lives with his longtime companion Rupert.

==Powers==
*He rarely participates in the Company’s missions.  He has made exceptions but only when the situation was dire. When he activates his powers Josiah transforms into a monstrous, grey, stone-like seven foot giant, and an energy corona begins to spark about his body. He gains great strength, invulnerability and possibly other energy based powers.[http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=josiahpower]
*At one point after seeing him in action Superman stated that Josiah was one of the most powerful metas he'd ever met.
