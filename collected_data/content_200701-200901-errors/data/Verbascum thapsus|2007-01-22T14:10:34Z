'''''Verbascum thapsus''''' ('''Common''' or '''Great Mullein''') is a species of [[mullein]], native to [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and introduced in the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]]. Other common names include '''Woolly''' or '''Flannel Mullein''', '''Shepherd's Club''', and '''Aaron's Rod'''.<!--Have cite, but not right at hand {{fact}}--> The [[specific epithet]] ''thapsus'' was first used by [[Theophrastus]] for an unspecified herb from the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] settlement of Thapsos, near modern [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]],<ref>{{sv icon}} [http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/scrophularia/verba/verbtha.html Den virtuella Floran: ''Verbascum thapsus''], retrieved on [[December 29]] [[2006]].</ref> though it is frequently related to the ancient [[Tunisia]]n city of [[Thapsus]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Charters|first=Michael L.|title=Plant name: T| work= California Plant Names: Latin and Greek Meanings and Derivations| url=http://www.calflora.net/botanicalnames/pageT.html|publisher=Calflora.net| accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref>

Common mullein is a hairy [[biennial plant]] that can grow up to 2&nbsp;meters. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on the stem, which bolts from a large rosette of leaves. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but favors well-lit disturbed soils the most, which it can invades rapidly thanks to its long-lived seeds. Common Mullein is a weedy, but rarely competitive species. While not an issue for most cultures, it hosts many insects that can be harmful to other plants, such as the [[tarnished plant bug]], and although individuals are easy to destroy by hand, it is difficult to destroy a population permanently.

''V. thapsus'' is widely used as an herbal remedy with [[emollient]] and [[astringent]] properties. It is especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in [[topical]] applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant was also used to make [[dye]]s and torches.

==Distribution and naturalization==

The species has a wide native range including [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], from the [[Azores]] and [[Canary Islands]] east to western [[China]], north to the [[British Isles]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[Siberia]], and south to the [[Himalaya]].<ref name="flora">[http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&GENUS_XREF=Verbascum&SPECIES_XREF=thapsus Flora Europaea: ''Verbascum thapsus''], retrieved on [[December 29]] [[2006]].</ref><ref name="china"/><ref name="grin">[http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?41150 Germplasm Resources Information Network: ''Verbascum thapsus''], retrieved on [[December 29]] [[2006]].</ref> It has been introduced throughout the temperate world, and is [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in [[North America]] (including [[Hawaii]]), [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[Hispaniola]] and [[Argentina]] (1925).<ref name = "grin"/><ref>{{Es icon}} {{cite web|title=  Ficha de la Especie Verbascum thapsus|url=http://www.uns.edu.ar/inbiar/ver_especie.asp?especie_id=333|work=Base de Datos sobre Invasiones Biológicas en Argentina|publisher=Universidad Nacional del Sur|accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref><ref name="ISSG">{{cite web|title=Verbascum thapsus|url=http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=695|date=[[8 July]] [[2005]]|work=Global Invasive Species Database|publisher=IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref> In the United States it was imported very early and cultivated for its medicinal property.

==Ecological aspects==
Common Mullein is most frequently met as a colonizer of bare and disturbed soil. This is in part due to its intolerance of shade and the very long periods during which the seeds can remain dormant before [[germination]]. It is not an agricultural [[weed]], although its presence can be very difficult to completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in [[overgrazing|overgrazed]] pastures.<ref name="Hoshovsky">Hoshovsky (2001)</ref><ref name="remaley"/><ref name="davis">{{Cite web|last=Pitcairn|first=Michael|title=Verbascum thapsus |url=http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/datastore/detailreport.cfm?usernumber=87&surveynumber=182 |work=|publisher=[[University of California Davis]]|accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref>

[[Image:Starr 040723 0074 verbascum thapsus.jpg|thumb|right|''V. thapsus'' grows best where there is little competition]]

''V. thapsus'' favors dry, sandy or gravelly soils, although it can grow in a variety of habitats: meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. It germinates almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10&nbsp;[[°C]] and 40&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> This ability to grow in a wide range of habitats has been linked to strong [[phenotype]] variation rather than [[adaptation]] capacities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Ingrid M.|coauthors=Joseph Rodriguez, Michael E.

===Life cycle===

Common Mullein requires [[vernalization]] before it can flowers, which is the reason why it is a biennial.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> This vernalization is linked to [[starch]] degradation in the root activated by low temperatures, and [[gibberellin]] application bypasses this requirement.<ref name="phyt"/> Plants that germinate in autumn overwinter if they are large enough (rosettes less than 15&nbsp;cm across die in winter) before flowering the next year. The entire plant usually dies at the end of its second year.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> Some individuals, especially in the northern parts of the species' range, flower in their third year. Under better conditions, some individuals flower in the first year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinartz|first=James A.|title=Life History Variation of Common Mullein (''Verbascum Thapsus''): I.

===Agricultural impacts and control===
Common Mullein is not considered an agricultural weed because it cannot compete with established plants, and is easily crowded out by them, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as [[California]]n semi-desertic areas of the Eastern [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]], where it crowds out native herbs and grasses. Its tendency to appear after [[forest fire]]s also disturbs the normal [[ecological succession]].<ref name="Hoshovsky"/><ref name="davis"/>

[[Image:Common Mullein closeup.jpg|right|thumb|The hairy leaves are resistant to grazing and contact herbicides.]]

Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via mechanical means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably followed by sowing of native plants. Animals rarely [[grazing|graze]] it because of its irritating hairs, and liquid [[herbicide]]s require [[surfactant]]s to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the [[lotus effect]]. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for [[seedling]]s to colonize.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/><ref name="remaley"/><ref name="davis"/> ''G. tetrum'' and ''Cucullia verbasci'' usually have little effect on ''V. thapsus'' populations.<ref name="remaley"/> Goats and chickens have been proposed to control Mullein.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include [[glyphosate]],<ref name="remaley"/><ref name="davis"/> [[triclopyr]]<ref name="remaley"/> and [[sulfurometuron-methyl]].<ref name="davis"/> Ground herbicides, like [[tebuthiuron]], are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/>

==Uses==
Great Mullein has been used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and breathing ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an [[astringent]] and [[emollient]]. It contains [[mucilage]], several [[saponin]]s, [[coumarin]] and [[glycoside]]s. [[Dioscorides]] recommended it for diseases of the [[lung]] and it is nowadays widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included [[dye]]ing and making [[torch]]es.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Great Mullein is called ''Gordolobo'', a name transferred to ''[[Gnaphalium]] conoideum''. ''G. conoideum'' is used similarly by the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Aztec]]s, which caused confusion in naming, and the two are sold under the name "Gordolobo," which has lead to at least one case of poisoning due to confusion of ''G. conoideum'' with ''[[Senecio]] longilobus.''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kay| first=Margaret| title=Poisoning by Gordolobo|url=http://www.herbalgram.org/iherb/herbalgram/articleview.asp?a=1122 |journal=HerbalGram|issue=32|pages=42|year=1994|month=Fall| id={{ISSN|0899-5648}}}}</ref>
