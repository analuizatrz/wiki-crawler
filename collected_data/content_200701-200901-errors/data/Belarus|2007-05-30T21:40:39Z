'''Belarus''' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]: '''Беларусь''' Transliteration: ''Byelarus'') {{Audio|Belarus.ogg|listen}} is a [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[country]] in the region traditionally called [[Eastern Europe]], bordering [[Russia]] to the east, [[Ukraine]] to the south, [[Poland]] to the west, and [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] to the north. Its capital is [[Minsk]] and other major cities include [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], [[Hrodna|Grodno]], [[Homyel|Gomel]], [[Mogilev]] and [[Vitebsk]]. One third of the country is forested, and industries such as agriculture and manufacturing are staples of the Belarusian economy. Belarus is one of the countries most affected by nuclear radiation from the 1986 [[Chernobyl]] nuclear accident in the neighboring Ukraine.

At different points in its history, parts of Belarus have been under the control of several countries, including the [[Duchy of Polatsk]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. Belarus became a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republic in 1922 (see [[Belorussian SSR]]). The republic declared its sovereignty on [[27 July]] [[1990]]. Following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse]] of the Soviet Union, Belarus officially declared independence on [[25 August]] [[1991]]. Since 1994, [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president. During his rule, Lukashenko used Soviet-era policies, despite objections from Western powers. Belarus is negotiating with Russia to unify into a single state: the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]], although the discussions have stalled for several years.

Historically, the country was referred to in [[English language|English]] as "[[White Russia]]", although this is not exactly correct. The correct translation is "White [[Ruthenia|Rus']]", which either describes the area of Eastern Europe populated by Slavic people or the various states that occupied the area.<ref>[http://www.halgal.com/ruthenian.html Genealogy of Halychyna/Eastern Galicia] - An Understanding of the Terms
'Ruthenia' and 'Ruthenians'. Retrieved [[March 19]] [[2007]].</ref> Despite this, the practice of using the term White Russia continues as of 2006 in the following languages: "Weißrussland" in [[German language|German]], "Beyaz Rusya" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or "Λευκορωσία" (Levkorosía) in [[Greek language|Greek]] (see [[wiktionary:Belarus]] for the full list). <!-----Please don't insert any other languages' translations of Belarus; they belong on the [[White Russia]] page. Thanks!----->

The first known use of the term "White Russia" to refer to Belarus was in the late sixteenth century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]]. He used the term to describe areas of [[Ivan IV|Ivan the Terrible's]] empire. During the seventeenth century, the Russian tsars used "White [[Ruthenia|Rus']]", asserting that they were trying to recapture their heritage from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref>Pravapis.org [http://www.pravapis.org/art_white_russia.asp Why is Russia White?] Authored by Ales Biely. Published in 2000. Retrieved [[March 22]] [[2007]].</ref>

Belarus was named "Belorussia" in the days of [[Imperial Russia]], and the Russian [[tsar]] was usually styled "Czar of [[All the Russias]] — [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]]". This practice continued throughout the [[Soviet era]], with the country taking the official name of the "[[Belorussian SSR|Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]". Some Belarusians object to the name "Byelorussia", as an unwelcome reminder of the days under Russian and Soviet rule.<ref name="byelorussia">Pravapis.org [http://www.pravapis.org/art_belarusian_adjective.asp Uses and spellings of the word ''Belarusian''].

{{main|History of Belarus}}
Between the sixth and the twelfth centuries, what is now known as Belarus was settled by the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], who still dominate the country. The [[Early East Slavs]] gradually came into contact with the [[Varangians]] and were organized by them under the state of [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |ency=The Columbia Encyclopedia| edition= |year=2001-2005 |article=Kievan Rus |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ki/KievanRu.html}}</ref>

In the thirteenth century, several of the separate Ruthenian principalities were badly affected by a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion. Later, parts of Rus were swallowed up by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/grandduchy.htm University of Washington] - The Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Cheryl Renshaw. Published on June 5, 2002. Retrieved March 18, 2007.</ref> Most of its population was ethnically slavonic. Slavonic lands enjoyed limited autonomy within Lithuanian state. Sometimes it is wrongly supposed that Belarusian was the official language of the state, because Latin, Old Russian (Ruthenian) and Polish were used side by side in state affairs. Belarusian language was born only in a middle of 19th century when Russian speakers in modern day Belarusian territory were subject to a heavy Polish cultural influence. At the beginning of 17th century Old Russian language was banned in Lithuania and replaced by Polish which was dominant for centuries already. Therefore the use of Old Russian (Old Slavonic-Ruthenian) was allowed in Ruthenian autonomies (principalities). Belarusian lands were easily incorporated into the Duchy within the next one hundred years, because of the strength of Lithuania and the threat of Mongols on modern day Belarusian lands. During this time, the Duchy was involved with battles between different forces. One of the major battles was between the Duchy and the [[Teutonic Knights]] at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410. The Duchy won the battle and the victory allowed the Duchy to control the North-western borders of Eastern Europe.<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs [http://www.mfa.gov.by/eng/publications/collection/guide/1024/4.htm Guide to Belarus 2000 - History and Culture].

On [[February 2]] [[1386]], [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Jogaila]] was crowned [[King of Poland]], and allied the Grand Duchy with [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in a [[personal union]]. The union was formed between Jogaila and the daughter of King Luis of Poland, Jadwiga, by marriage. This was seen by the Polish as a move to end a union with Hungary.<ref>World History at KMLA [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/eceurope/union.html History of Poland - Dynastic Union under the Jagiellonian Dynasty].

Belarus first declared independence on [[25 March]] [[1918]], forming the [[Belarusian National Republic|Belarusian People's Republic]]. The Republic, however, was short-lived, and the regime was overthrown soon after the German withdrawal. In 1919, Belarus became the [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (BSSR). After Russian occupation of eastern and northern Lithuania, it was merged into the [[Lithuanian-Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. After the [[Polish-Soviet War]] ended in 1921, Byelorussian lands were split between Poland and the [[Bolsheviks]], and the recreated Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in 1922.<ref>[http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~MidLink/belarus/belarus.history.html University of Central Florida] - History of Belarus.

After the war ended, Byelorussia was among the fifty-one signatories to the founding of the [[United Nations Charter]] in 1945. After the war, Belarus began a process of rebuilding, with help from Moscow. During this time, Belarus became a major center of manufacturing in the western region of the USSR. The increase in jobs brought in a huge immigrant population from the [[Russian SFSR|Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]].<ref name="Soviet-era">{{cite web |url=http://www.iexplore.com/dmap/Belarus/History |title=iExplore - Belarus History and Culture |accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

Under the control of [[Joseph Stalin]], a policy of [[Sovietization]] was started to "protect" Byelorussian SSR from influences by [[the West]]. <!--The plan was to have any trace of Belarus's cultural identity to be replaced by those of Russia.--> This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Belorussian SSR government. The official use of the [[Belarusian language]] and other cultural aspects were limited by [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Moscow]]. After Stalin died in 1953, his successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], continued this program, stating, "The sooner we all start speaking [[Russian language|Russian]], the faster we shall build [[communism]]."<ref name="warpop"/> When Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] began pushing through his [[Perestroika]] plan, the Belarusian people delivered a petition to him in December 1986 explaining the loss of [[culture of Belarus|their culture]]. This event has been coined by historians as the "cultural Chernobyl". (Earlier that year, Belarus was exposed to [[nuclear fallout]] from the explosion at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] power plant in neighboring [[Ukrainian SSR]].)<ref name="Gorby">{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/belarus/12.htm |title=Country Studies - Belarus - Perestroika |accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> In June of [[1988]], [[mass graves]] were discovered at the city of [[Kurapaty]].

After the discovery of the mass graves by archaeologist [[Zyanon Paznyak]], it caused some Belarusians to press Moscow on why this happened. After clashes with the police, the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] was created in October of 1988, having [[Paznyak]] as the chairman of the new party. Two years later in March of 1990, elections for seats in the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the BSSR took place. While only 10% of the seats were taken by the BPF, the populace was content with the selection of the delegates. Belarus declared itself sovereign on [[27 July]] [[1990]], by the issuance of the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The BSSR became the Republic of Belarus on [[25 August]] [[1991]], days after the coup on Gorbachev, even with the support of the [[Communist Party of Belarus]]. Days after the declaration, [[Belarusian Prime Minister]] [[Vyachaslaw Kyebich]] and his entire cabinent renounced their membership in the CPB, soon stopping the activities of the CPB completely.<ref name="byind">Country Studies [http://countrystudies.us/belarus/39.htm Belarus - Prelude to Indepdence]. Library of Congress. Retrieved March 21, 2007.</ref>

Around that time, [[Stanislav Shushkevich]] became Chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]] of Belarus, the top leadership position in Belarus, after liberals replaced [[Mikalay Dzyemyantsyey]] for siding with the coup. The white, red, white flag and the [[Pahonia]] shield were chosen as the national [[symbols of Belarus]]. Shushkevich, along with [[Boris Yeltsin]] of Russia and [[Leonid Kravchuk]] of [[Ukraine]], met on [[8 December]] [[1991]], in [[Belavezhskaya Pushcha]] to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], being headquartered in [[Minsk]]. In 1993, there was an agreement in the Supreme Soviet to reduce its service by one year, so that new elections could take place in 1994.<ref name="byind"/>

Before the [[Belarusian presidential election, 1994|1994 elections]], two events occurred that shaped Belarus forever. First, Shushkevich was ousted by a vote of no-confidence and replaced by a Kyebich ally, [[Myechyslaw Hryb]]. In March of that year, a national constitution was adopted, which replaced the office of prime minister with that of a [[president of Belarus|president]]. With the first round of elections for president, the two candidates for the office were Kyebich and [[Alexander Lukashenko]], who campaigned on a plan to rid the government of corruption. In the second round in July, Lukashenko was declared the winner with over 80% of the vote.<ref name="byind"/> Since that election, Lukashenko has held the office of president, being reelected [[Belarusian presidential election, 2001|in 2001]] and [[Belarusian presidential election, 2006|in 2006]].

There appears to be a movement in Belarus towards reuniting with [[Russia]]. In November 2005, [[Belarusian draft constitution of 2005|a draft constitution]] was sent to both [[Vladimir Putin]] and Lukashenko for approval.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20051114-102844-6237r.htm |title=Belarus union moves forward |first=Michael |last=Mainville |journal=The Washington Times |month=November 15 |year=2005}}</ref> This move, along with others, is part of the 1996 plan created by Lukashenko and former Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] to create a [[Union of Russia and Belarus|union between the two nations]].

{{main|Politics of Belarus}}
Belarus is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], governed by a [[Leaders of Belarus|President]] and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]]—the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]]. The assembly comprises a lower house, the 110-member [[House of Representatives of the Republic of Belarus|House of Representatives]], and an upper house, the 64-member [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]]. The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the [[Prime Minister]] of Belarus, make constitutional amendments, call for a [[Motion of Confidence|vote of confidence]] on the prime minister, and make suggestions on the foreign and domestic policy of Belarus. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and the ability to accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the [[Constitution of Belarus]].<ref name="conby">Constitution of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html#doc Chapter 3 - The President, Parliament,Government, the Courts]. Published 1994, amended 1995 and 2004. Retrieved March 22, 2007.</ref>

The Belarusian President since 1994 has been [[Alexander Lukashenko]]. The government is a [[Council (government)|Council]] of Ministers, headed by a [[Prime Minister of Belarus|prime minister]]. The members of the Council of Ministers need not be members of the legislature, and are appointed by the President. The judiciary is comprised of the [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme Court]] and various specialized courts, such as the [[Constitutional Court of Belarus|Constitutional Court]], which deals with specific issues related to the constitution or business law. The judges of the Constitutional Court are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic.<ref name="conby"/>

In Belarus, while there are [[political party|political parties]] that either support or oppose President Lukashenko, the majority of the seats in the House of Representatives are filled by those not affiliated with any political parties ("non-partisans"). However, in constitutional as well as political terms, the House is of marginal importance. At the 2000 election, it took four rounds of voting before all the seats were filled; in the end, 86% of the elected deputies were independents, and the remainder were the representatives of parties traditionally loyal to the president (OSCE, 2000). Three political parties currently have seats in the House of Representatives: the [[Communist Party of Belarus]] (eight seats), the [[Agrarian Party of Belarus]] (three seats), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus]] (one seat). The other two parties that pledged their support to Lukashenko, the [[Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party]] and the [[Republican Party of Labour and Justice]], did not secure any seats in the October 2004 election. Opposition parties, such as the [[Belarusian People's Front]](BPF) and the [[United Civil Party of Belarus]] (UCPB) also did not gain any seats. The UCPB and the BPF are two of the parties that comprise the [[People's Coalition 5 Plus]], a group of political parties who oppose Lukashenko. Several organizations, including the [[OSCE|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)]], declared the election "un-free" due to opposition parties' negative results and the bias of the Belarusian media in favor of the government.<ref name="OSCE">{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/item/3961.html |format=PDF |title=OSCE Report on the October 2004 parliamentary elections |year=December 2004 |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref>

The [[Belarusian presidential election, 2006|next round of elections]] took place on March 19, 2006, and included selecting the President. Lukashenko was opposed in the election by [[Alexander Milinkevich]], a candidate representing a coalition of opposition parties. Another opposition candidate, [[Alaksandar Kazulin]] of the Social Democrats was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the Lukashenko sponsored event, the [[All Belarusian People's Assembly]].

==Provinces and districts==
[[Image:Belarus.geohive.png|thumb|200px|right|Provinces of Belarus]]
{{main|Administrative divisions of Belarus}}
Belarus is divided into six [[province]]s ("[[voblast]]s"), named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers. The city of [[Minsk]], located in the Minsk province, has the special status of being a national subordinate, as it isn't included in any voblast. Subdivision into ''voblasts'' was inherited from the Soviet era. Voblasts are further subdivided into ''[[raion]]s'' (commonly translated as "[[district]]s" or "regions"). Local legislative authorities (''raisovet'', "raion council") are elected by the raion's residents. Local executive authorities (''raion administration'') are appointed by higher executive authorities. In the same way, each voblast has its own legislative authority (''oblsovet''), elected by residents, and an executive authority (''voblast administration''), whose leader is appointed by the President.

{{main|Geography of Belarus}}

Belarus is [[landlocked]], relatively flat, and contains large tracts of [[marsh]]y land. Lakes and rivers punctuate the country. The largest marsh territory is [[Polesie]], which is among the largest marshes in Europe. There are 11,000 lakes in Belarus, but the majority of the lakes are smaller than 0.5&nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (124&nbsp;[[acre]]s). Three major rivers run through the country; the [[Neman River]], the [[Pripyat River]], and the [[Dnepr River]]. Belarus' highest point is [[Dzyarzhynskaya Hara]] (Dzyarzhynsk Hill), 345&nbsp;[[metre]]s (1,132&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]), and its lowest point is on the Neman River, 90&nbsp;metres (295&nbsp;ft).

Belarus is home, along with Poland, to the ''Belaveskaya Pushcha'' (Белавеская пушча) or, by its Polish name, [[Białowieża Forest]], the only remaining, virgin part of the immense forest that once spread across the [[European Plain]].

The [[climate]] ranges from harsh [[winter]]s (average January temperatures are in the range −8&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]](18&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) to −2&nbsp;°C (28&nbsp;°F)) to cool and moist [[summer]]s (average temperature 15&nbsp;°C (59&nbsp;°F) to 20&nbsp;°C(68&nbsp;°F)). On average, 15 to 30 [[centimeter]]s of snow falls in the country, mostly in the northeast. Belarus experiences an average [[rainfall]] of 600 to 700 [[millimeter]]s with over 70% of the rain falling during the warmer periods of the year. Due to the weather patterns, [[natural disaster]]s such as [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s occasionally occur in Belarus. Between the period of 1881 until 2005, the average temperature of Belarus rose 1 degree Celsius, with temperatures rising significantly during the winter and spring months. It has been projected that Belarus will face a 3 to 4 degree rise in average temperatures when the twenty-first century ends.<ref>Belarus Tourist Agency [http://www.belarustourist.minsk.by/belarus/climate.html Climate of Belarus]. Retrieved March 18, 2007.</ref>

Forest covers about 34% of the total landscape, making forestry products one of the most abundant natural resources in Belarus. Other natural resources found in Belarus include [[peat]] deposits, small quantities of [[petroleum|oil]] and natural gas, [[granite]], dolomite ([[limestone]]), [[marl]], [[chalk]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], and [[clay]].

About one-fifth of the territory, mostly in the southeastern provinces of [[Homyel voblast|Homyel]] and [[Mahilyow voblast|Mahilyow]], continue to be affected by fallout from the 1986 [[nuclear power plant]] disaster in [[Chernobyl]], [[Ukraine]]. While the amount of radiation has decreased since the disaster, most of the area is considered uninhabitable. Approximately 70% of the total radiation emitted from the Chernobyl plant entered into Belarusian territory.<ref name="Chernobyl">{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4485003.stm| publisher=BBC News| title=Belarus cursed by Chernobyl| first=Sarah| last=Rainsford| year=April 26 2005| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

Belarus is bordered by the following nations: Latvia (north), Lithuania (northwest), Poland (west), Russia (north and east) and Ukraine (south). Since its departure from the Soviet Union, Belarus signed a treaty with Latvia and Lithuania to [[demarcate]] the boundaries between the three countries. Ukraine signed a similar agreement with Belarus, though ratification on the Belarusian side is pending.<ref>[http://www.gkpv.gov.by/en/state_border_en/delim_history Border Demarcation History].

{{main|Economy of Belarus}}
The Belarusian [[Economic system|economy]] remains mostly [[state intervention|state-controlled]], as in Soviet times. Over half of the business are state controlled and foreign ownership is under 4%.<ref name="labor">Ministry of Statistics and Analysis
[http://belstat.gov.by/homep/en/indicators/labor.php Labor Statistics in Belarus]. Published 2005. Retrieved March 18, 2007.</ref> The country is relatively stable economically, but depends to a large extent on raw material supplies, such as oil, from its close ally [[Russia]]. [[Industry]] and [[agriculture]] remain largely in state hands. Agriculture is dominated by collective farming, with major sub-sectors being the [[cultivation]] of [[potato]]es and [[Animal husbandry|cattle breeding]].

Historically important branches of industry include [[textile]]s and wood processing. After 1965, creation of heavy industry and [[mechanical engineering]] ([[tractor]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, etc.) significantly strengthened the country's development. Within the Soviet Union, Belarus was one of the most industrially-developed republics. Economically, Belarus involved itself in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), [[Eurasian Economic Community]], and [[Union of Russia and Belarus|Union with Russia]]. Soon after 1990, industrial production plunged due to the introduction of free market structures into the former Soviet Union. Economic growth returned in 1996, and in 2001 Belarus was the first CIS country to reach Soviet-era levels of industrial production and agricultural production.

Gross domestic product (GDP) for 2005 was $79.13 billion (estimate), or about $7,700 per capita. In 2005, the [[gross domestic product]] increased by about 8-9%, with the inflation rate averaging about 8%. According to the [[United Nations|UN]], average monthly income grew from US$20 to US$225 during the last 10 years.

Over four million people comprise the labor force in Belarus, with women holding slightly more jobs than men. In 2005, nearly a quarter of the population were employed in industrial factories. Employment is also high in agriculture, manufacturing sales, trading goods, and education. The [[unemployment]] rate, according to Belarusian government statistics, was about 1.5% in 2005. The number of unemployed persons totaled 679,000, with approximately two-thirds being women. The rate of unemployment has been decreasing since 2003, and the overall rate has been lower since statistics were first taken in 1995.<ref name="labor"/>

The currency of Belarus is the [[Belarusian ruble]] (BYR). The currency was introduced in May of 1992, replacing the [[Soviet ruble]]. The ruble was re-introduced with new values in 2000 and has been in use since.<ref>National Bank of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.nbrb.by/Natiobank/Banknotes/ENG/index.html History of the Belarusian Ruble].

The Belarusian economy has been impacted by the political situations inside the republic. The impact is mostly felt in the form of sanctions against the country or the leadership of Belarus. For example, the European Union adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 765/2006 on 18 May 2006. The Regulation provided for a freeze on the funds of President Lukashenko and between 30 to 35 high-level officials of Belarus. The sanctions also provided for travel bans for the aforementioned leaders. The sanction was imposed by the EU after the nation-block declared that the 19 March 2006 elections were fraudulent and called for the crackdown on opposition groups.<ref>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/05/F70F8119-C1B0-410C-A9BF-790C0034F3C9.html EU Sanctions on Belarus].

The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus]]' period. Due to the climate of Belarus, clothing that kept a person warm was required. The clothes that were made in Belarus were composed of either [[flax]] or [[wool]] and were decorated with ornate patterns and over time, has been influenced by the cultures of its neighbors: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations.

[[Belarusian cuisine]] consists of mostly of vegetables, meats and breads. The foods that are considered to be staples of Belarus include pork, cabbages, potatoes and bread.  Because of traditional cooking methods in the pre-Soviet era, foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. A typical Belarusian eats in a day a very light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are both consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful due to the conditions being too harsh to grow wheat. When greeting a guest or visitor, an offering of bread salt is presented to show hospitality.<ref>Canadian Citizenship and Immigration - [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project - Eating the Belarusian Way].

In the field of music, the first major composition by a Belarusian was the opera [[Faust]] by Radzivill and other opera pieces. In the seventeenth century, Polish composer [[Stanislau Maniushka]] resided in Belarus, composing many opera and chamber pieces while in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vincent Dunin-Marcinkevich]] and created the opera [[Sialianka]] (Peasant Woman). At the end of the nineteenth century, the major cities in Belarus were forming their own opera and ballet companies. During the Soviet era, early music saw the creation of the ballet [[Nightingale]] by M. Kroshner. After the Great Patriotic War, the music focused on the hardship of the Belarusian people or on the Belarusians who took up arms in defense of the homeland. This was also the time period that A. Bogatyryov, the creator of the opera "In Polesye Virgin Forest," served as the "tutor" of Belarusian composers. After independence, ballet is still important culturally to Belarus. The National Academic Theatre of Ballet, in Minsk, was awarded the [[Benois de la Dance Prize]] in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world.<ref>Virtual Guide to Belarus - [http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/music/Belarusian_composers_&_classical_music.htm Classical Music of Belarus].
