[[Image:020904whale 210.jpg|right|framed|[[Dynamite]] was used to blow up a rotting [[beached whale]], with unforeseen consequences.]]
'''Exploding whales''' have been documented on two notable occasions, as well as several lesser-known ones. The most famous [[explosion]] occurred in the [[United States]] at [[Florence, Oregon|Florence]], [[Oregon]], in 1970, when a dead [[sperm whale]] (originally reported as a [[gray whale]]) was blown up by the [[Oregon Department of Transportation|Oregon Highway Division]] in an attempt to dispose of its rotting [[carcass]]. This incident became famous in the U.S. when American [[humorist]] [[Dave Barry]] wrote about it in his newspaper column after viewing a videotape of television footage of the explosion. It later became well-known internationally when the same footage [[viral video|circulated on the Internet]]. 

There have also been self-explosions. The other best-reported case of an exploding whale was in [[Taiwan]] in 2004, when a buildup of [[gas]] inside a [[Decomposition|decomposing]] sperm whale caused it to explode while it was being transported for a [[post-mortem]] examination. As exploding whales are an interesting and absurd topic, they have been written about by several authors.

==Incidents==
There are documented cases of [[exploding animal]]s, though such happenings are fairly rare. There have been a number of incidents where whales have been detonated; the most notable occurred in the United States and in Taiwan and were widely covered by the world press. However, less famous explosions have been carried out in other parts of the world.

===Florence, Oregon, USA===
[[Image:PDcapture1.jpg||left|framed|The [[Oregon Department of Transportation|Oregon Highway Division]] failed to dispose of this whale carcass properly when they blew it up with half a ton of dynamite.]]

On [[November 12]], [[1970]], a 14&nbsp;m (45&nbsp;ft), eight-[[Tonne|ton]] [[sperm whale]] died as a result of [[Beached whale|beaching]] itself near Florence, Oregon.<ref name="spermwhale">Linnman, Paul and Doug Brazil, Chapter 7. Linnman contacted Dr. Bruce Mate, a [[marine biologist]] at the [[Hatfield Marine Science Center]] in [[Newport]] who was there that day.

They thought [[burial|burying]] the whale would be ineffective, as it would soon be uncovered, and they believed the use of dynamite would cause an explosion that would disintegrate the whale into pieces small enough for [[scavenger]]s to clear up. The engineer in charge of the operation, George Thornton, was recorded as stating that one set of charges might not be enough and more might be needed. Thornton later explained that he was chosen to remove the whale because the district engineer, Dale Allen, had gone [[hunting]].<ref name="linnmantranscript">Report by Paul Linnman ([[KATU]] TV), transcribed by Hackstadt, J.; Hackstadt, S.

The resulting explosion was caught on film by television photographer Doug Brazil for a story reported by [[journalist|news reporter]] [[Paul Linnman]] of [[KATU]]-TV in [[Portland, Oregon]].  In his [[voiceover]], Linnman joked that "land-lubber newsmen" became "land-''blubber'' newsmen", for "the blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds."<ref name="linnmantranscript"/> The explosion caused large pieces of [[blubber]] to land some distance away from the beach, resulting in a smashed car. The explosion disintegrated only some of the whale, most of which remained on the beach for the Oregon Highway Division workers to clear away.

At the end of his news story, Paul Linnman noted that "It might be concluded that should a whale ever be washed ashore in [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]] again, those in charge will not only remember what to do, they'll certainly remember what ''not'' to do." It was reported in the ODOT's employee newspaper, ''TranScript'', that when 41 sperm whales beached nearby in 1979, state parks officials burned and buried them.<ref name="transcriptwhaledisposal">[http://tafkac.org/animals/exploding.whale/son_of_blubber.html "Son of blubber"]. Oregon Department of Transportation employee newspaper, ''TranScript'', July 1994. Accessed [[January 8]], [[2007]].</ref> Today, beach managers tow dead beached whales to the open sea. This is done mainly for safety reasons, as the rotting corpses have been known to attract [[shark]]s and so become a danger to beach users. 

For several years, the story of the exploding whale was commonly disbelieved and thought to be an [[urban legend]]. However, it was brought to widespread public attention by popular writer [[Dave Barry]] in his ''[[Miami Herald]]'' column of [[May 20]], [[1990]], when he reported that he had footage of the event. Some time later the Oregon State Highway division started to receive calls from the media after a shortened version of the article was distributed on [[Bulletin board system|bulletin boards]] under the title "[[The Far Side|The Farside]] Comes To Life In Oregon". However, the piece did not explain that the event had happened approximately twenty five years previously and whoever had copied Barry's article neglected to include the authorship of the piece; Dave Barry says that on a fairly regular basis someone forwards him the "authorless" column and suggests he write something about the described incident. Due to these oversights, an article in the ODOT's ''TranScript'' notes that

{{quote|"We started getting calls from curious reporters across the country right after the electronic bulletin board story appeared," said Ed Schoaps, public affairs coordinator for the Oregon Department of Transportation. "They thought the whale had washed ashore recently, and were hot on the trail of a governmental blubber flub-up. They were disappointed that the story has twenty five years of dust on it."

Schoaps has fielded calls from reporters and the just plain curious in Oregon, [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Massachusetts]]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called, and Washington, D.C.-based ''Governing'' magazine covered the immortal legend of the beached whale in its June issue. And the phone keeps ringing. "I get regular calls about this story," Schoaps said. His phone has become the blubber hotline for ODOT, he added. "It amazes me that people are still calling about this story after nearly twenty five years."<ref name="snopes"/>

The footage that was referred to in the article, from KATU for the news story reported by Paul Linnman, resurfaced later as a [[Digital video|video]] [[Computer file|file]] on several websites and became a reasonably well-known and popular [[Internet meme]].<ref name="hackstadtevidence">Steven Hackstadt, [http://www.theexplodingwhale.com/#evidence The Evidence], TheExplodingWhale.com Accessed [[November 7]] [[2005]]; [http://perp.com/whale/ The Infamous Exploding Whale] perp.com, Accessed [[June 6]] [[2005]]).</ref> These websites attracted criticism from upset people who complained that they were making fun of acts of [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]], even though the whale was already dead. Their critical emails were subsequently published by the bemused site webmasters.

The story of Oregon's exploding whale was widely known on [[Usenet]] for quite some time and was in particular discussed on [[alt.folklore.urban]], a [[newsgroup]] devoted to urban legends. The incident, including a complete copy of Barry's article, was recorded in the newsgroup's 1991 [[FAQ]], then maintained by Peter van der Linden, where it was marked as "Tb" (believed true, but not conclusively proven).<ref name="petervanderlinden">Peter van der Linden, [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.folklore.urban/msg/2311d952c25e2bd6?output=gplain Well, I'll be FAQ'ed.], Google Groups, [[June 28]] [[1991]].

Since then, the Oregon explosion has inspired a website devoted to the incident<ref name=fansite>Hackstadt, J.; Hackstadt, S.

Accessed [[January 8]], [[2007]].</ref> and has also been [[parodied]] in the [[The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist, Part II|second season]] of the [[Comedy Central]] show ''[[Drawn Together]]'', in which a group of tribesmen attempt to move the carcass of [[Toot Braunstein]], the fattest of the show's characters, by blowing up her body.

===Tainan, Taiwan===
[[Image:040129 exploding whale hlrg 8a.hlarge.jpg|frame|This whale explosion in [[Taiwan]] happened due to a natural buildup of internal [[gas]]es during its transportation to a research establishment near the southwestern city of [[Tainan]].]]
A second whale explosion occurred on [[January 26]], [[2004]], in [[Tainan City]], [[Taiwan]]. In this incident, a buildup of gas inside a decomposing [[sperm whale]], measuring 17 meters (56 ft.) long and weighing 50 tons, caused it to burst. The older bull whale had died after becoming beached on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, and it had taken more than 13 hours, three large [[crane (machine)|cranes]], and 50 workers to shift the beached sperm whale onto the back of a truck.

While the whale was being moved, the paper's website ''[[Taiwan News]]'', ''eTaiwanNews.com'', reported that "a large crowd of more than 600 local [[Yunlin County|Yunlin]] residents and curiosity seekers, along with vendors selling snack food and hot drinks, braved the cold temperature and chilly wind to watch workmen try to haul away the dead marine [[leviathan]]".<ref name="jasonpan">Pan, Jason.

Accessed [[January 8]], [[2007]]. </ref>
Professor Wang Chien-ping had ordered the whale be moved to the [[Sutsao Wild Life Reservation Area]] after he had been refused permission to perform a [[post-mortem]] at the [[National Cheng Kung University]] in Tainan. The whale was being transported on the back of a truck through the center of Tainan from the university laboratory to the preserve when the explosion occurred.  Although the explosion was spectacular, it did not stop researchers from performing a [[necropsy]] on the animal.

The explosion was reported to have splattered blood and whale entrails over surrounding shop-fronts, bystanders, and cars. [[BBC News Online]] interviewed an unnamed Taiwanese local who said, "What a stinking mess. This blood and other stuff that blew out on the road is disgusting, and the smell is really awful."<ref name="bbctaiwaneselocal">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3437455.stm "Whale explodes in Taiwanese city"]. ''BBC News'', [[January 29]], [[2004]].  Accessed [[January 8]], [[2007]]. </ref>

Over the course of about one year, Professor Wang completed a bone display from the remains of the whale's rotting dead body. The assembled specimen and some preserved organs and tissues have been on display in the Taijiang Cetacean Museum ([[:zh:台江鯨豚館|zh:台江鯨豚館]]) since [[April 8]], [[2005]].

===Other incidents===
Whale corpses are regularly disposed of through the use of explosion; however, the whales are usually first towed out to sea. More than a few detonations, less notable than the ones in Oregon and Tainan, have been undertaken in [[South Africa]], while one explosion was done by authorities in [[Iceland]]. 

A number of controlled explosions have been made in South Africa. Explosives were used to kill a beached [[humpback whale]] 40 km (24 miles) west of [[Port Elizabeth]] on [[August 6]] [[2001]],<ref name="byelopravda">Timofei Byelo, "[http://english.pravda.ru/accidents/2001/08/08/12005.html Explosives used to blow up whale in South Africa]," ''Pravda''.

In this instance authorities said that the whale could not have been saved, and that the use of explosives in such cases was recommended by the [[International Whaling Commission]].<ref> [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/beached-whale-killed-with-explosives/2005/09/15/1126377408417.html "Beached whale killed with explosives".] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', [[September 15]], [[2005]].

In order to sink the whale, authorities towed it out to sea, and affixed explosives to it, later set off from a distance.<ref name="sthafricawhale"> [http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,88173,00.html "Beached whale towed, blown up at sea".]  ''SABCnews.com'',   [[September 20]], [[2004]].  Accessed [[January 8]], [[2007]].</ref> 

A whale carcass adrift in the Icelandic harbour of [[Hafnarfjörður]] was split in two by a controlled explosion on [[June 5]], [[2005]]. The  remains were dragged out to sea; however, they soon drifted back, and eventually had to be tied down.<ref name="mbl">[http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/frett.html?nid=1142126 "Hvalhræ dregið út á haf og síðan aftur upp í fjöru".]  mbl.is, [[June 5]], [[2005]] Accessed [[June 6]], [[2005]].</ref>

==In fiction==
Exploding whales are a theme written about by several authors; their unusual, absurd, and highly improbable nature makes them an interesting topic. For instance, [[Australia]]n children's book author [[Paul Jennings (Australian author)|Paul Jennings]] wrote a book called ''Uncanny!: Even More Surprising Stories'' that features a story about a father and son being given the task of blowing up a dead whale with [[gelignite]].  In [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s short story ''Two's Company'', written in 1937, a large whale is washed up against an isolated [[lighthouse]] occupied by two lighthouse keepers, creating a "seabird and shark feeding frenzy, not to mention an atrocious stench". The men beg for some explosives from the destroyer sent to re-supply them so they can dispose of the carcass. In [[Julian May]]'s ''[[Saga of Pliocene Exile]]'' series, a trickster genius character named [[Aiken Drum]] blows up a beached whale-like creature on the planet Dalriada, causing messy and disgusting results.

While not strictly about an actual explosion, in [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' a [[sperm whale]] materializes in thin air above a distant planet, only to fall several miles to the ground, creating "a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide" containing "the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale". The whale started life as an explosive: a nuclear missile, changed into a whale by the [[Infinite Improbability Drive]]. There is also a backreference to this literary incident in ''[[Fallout 2]]'', a [[personal computer|PC]] [[Computer role-playing game|role-playing game]] popular in the late 1990s. In one of the random encounters of the game, the player faces a huge exploded corpse of a sperm whale in the middle of the desert.

In the [[mockumentary]] [[Reno 911: Miami]], the officers face a rotting [[beached whale]] which they promptly blow-up with dynamite. Subsequently, raining whale blubber pelts the characters and they are later reprimanded after the whale parts are reported to have damaged boats in the area.
