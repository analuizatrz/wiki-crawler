The shirts worn by players of Ipswich Town did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design featuring a gold [[Lion (heraldry)|lion rampant guardant]] on a red background on the left half and three gold ramparts on a blue background on the right half.<ref name=kit/>  In 1972, the crest was redesigned as the result of a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage. Each element of the new design was intended to represent the region.<ref>{{Cite web

The crest was modified in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate moved to the top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to ''Football Club''.

}}</ref>  At their new home, Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets, in 1890,<ref name=stadium/> but the more substantial elements of ground development did not begin until, in 1901, a [[tobacco]] processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground.   

The first stand, a wooden structure, was built on the Portman Road side of the pitch in 1905. In 1911 the roof was blown off,<ref name=stadium/> and the ground was later commandeered by the [[British Army]] for the duration of the [[First World War]]. The club turned professional in 1936, and work began on the first bank of [[Bleacher|terracing]] at the north end of the pitch. The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern "Churchmans" end.{{ref label|Church|I|}}  All sides were terraced by 1954, and [[floodlight]]s were erected in 1959 for use in lower light conditions.<ref name=stadium/>  The two-tier Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971, and the west stand, then known as the "Pioneer Stand" as a result of the club's sponsorship by the electronics company [[Pioneer Corporation]], was converted to all-seating in 1990.<ref name=stadium/>  [[Image:ITFC Attendances.png|thumb|250px|left|Average and peak attendances from 1936.]]In 1990, following the recommendations of the [[Taylor Report]] in the wake of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] the previous year, the terraces in both the north and south stands were also converted to all-seating, creating the first complete all-seater stadium in the top flight of English football with a spectator capacity of 22,600.<ref name=stadium/>

Success on the pitch lead to further investment in the infrastructure, with the club spending over £22&nbsp;million on redeveloping both North and South stands, resulting in a current capacity of 30,311. In the past five years, statues of both Sir Alf Ramsey and Sir Bobby Robson have been unveiled outside the stadium.<ref>{{Cite web

Locally, much is made of the informal title "[[Pride of Anglia]]". Fans variously claim the title for either winning the East Anglian Derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position, having the more successful club history or for reasons without any apparent logical basis. The club's main local rival is [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. When the two teams meet it is known as the '[[East Anglian Derby]]', or, informally, as the '[[Old Farm Derby]]', a comic reference to the '[[Old Firm]] Derby' played between [[Scotland|Scottish]] teams [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref>{{Cite web

A recent nickname for Town is "The Tractor Boys", which was coined during the club's brief successful period in the Premiership ([[2000-01 in English football|2000&ndash;01]]) when the team regularly competed against more fashionable clubs. The nickname is an example of [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating humour]] referring to Ipswich's agricultural heritage.<ref name=tractorboys/>  The origins of the nickname are not certain, but the first generally-accepted use of the nickname appeared at a losing away game at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] late in the [[1998-99 in English football|1998&ndash;99]] season, with the home fans chanting "no noise from the Tractor Boys", a name which stuck.<ref>{{Cite web

==Statistics and records==
{{details|Ipswich Town F.C. records}}
[[Image:ITFC record.png|right|thumb|400px|League positions since 1938&ndash;39 season.<br />''Coloured horizontal lines indicate league divisions.'']]
[[Mick Mills]] holds the record for Ipswich league appearances, having played 591 first-team matches between 1966 and 1982. The club's top league goalscorer is [[Ray Crawford]], who scored 203 goals between 1958 and 1969, while [[Ted Phillips]] holds the record for the most goals scored in a season, 41 in the [[1956-57 in English football|1956&ndash;57]] season in [[Football League Third Division South|Division Three (South)]].  [[Allan Hunter (footballer)|Allan Hunter]] is the most capped player for the club, making 47 appearances for [[Northern Ireland football team|Northern Ireland]].

The club's widest victory margins in the league have been their 7&ndash;0 wins against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in the [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] in 1964, against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the [[Football League Division One|First Division]] in 1974 and against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the First Division in 1976. Their heaviest defeats in the league were 10&ndash;1 against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1963 and 9&ndash;0 against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1995.

Ipswich's record home attendance is 38,010 for a sixth round [[FA Cup]] match against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] on [[8 March]], [[1975]]. With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.

The highest transfer fee received for an Ipswich player is £6.5&nbsp;million, from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for [[Kieron Dyer]] in July 1999, while the most spent by the club on a player was £4.75&nbsp;million for [[Matteo Sereni]] from [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in July 2001 following the club's successful qualification for the UEFA Cup.<ref name=records>{{Cite web
