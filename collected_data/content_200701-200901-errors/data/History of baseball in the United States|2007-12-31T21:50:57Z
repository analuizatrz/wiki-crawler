{{HistBaseball nav}}

The '''History of baseball in the United States''' can be traced to the late 18th century, when amateurs played a baseball-like game by their own informal rules using improvised equipment. The popularity of the sport inspired the semi and fully professional baseball clubs in the 1860s. By the following decade, American newspapers were referring to baseball as the "National Pastime" or "National Game." The first attempt at forming a "[[Major League Baseball|major league]]" produced the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]], which lasted from 1871 to 1875. In response to the shortcomings of the [[National Association]], the current [[National League]] was formed in 1876. After a series of rival leagues were organized but failed, the current [[American league]], evolving from the minor Western League of 1893, was established in 1901.

In the early part of the 20th century, known as the "[[dead-ball era]]," baseball rules and equipment favored the "inside game" and the game was played more violently and aggressively than it is today. This period ended in the 1920s with several changes that gave advantages to hitters.  In the largest parks, the outfield fences were brought closer to the infield.  In addition, the strict enforcement of new rules governing the size, shape and construction of the ball caused it to travel farther when hit.
 
The first professional black baseball club, the Cuban Giants, was organized in 1885. Subsequent professional black baseball clubs played each other independently, without an official league to organize the sport. [[Rube Foster]], a former ballplayer with a gift for organization, founded the [[Negro National League]] in [[1920]].  A second league, the [[Eastern Colored League]], was established in [[1923]].  These became known as the "[[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]]. The Negro National League did well until 1930, but folded during the great depression.

From 1942 to 1948 the [[Negro League World Series]] was revived. This was the golden era of Negro League baseball, a time when it produced some of its greatest stars. In 1947, Jackie Robinson signed a contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, breaking the color barrier that had prevented talented African American players from entering the white-only major leagues. Although the transformation was not instantaneous, baseball has since become fully [[racial integration|integrated]]. In 1948, the Negro Leagues faced financial difficulties that effectively ended their existence. 

Pitchers dominated the game in the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1973 the [[designated hitter]] (DH) rule was adopted by the American League, while in the National League pitchers still bat for themselves to this day. The DH rule now constitutes the primary difference between the two leagues. During the late 1960s, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Baseball Players Union]] became much stronger and conflicts between owners and the players' union led to major work stoppages in 1972, 1981, and 1994. The [[1994 baseball strike]] led to the cancellation of the World Series, and was not settled until the spring of 1995. In the wake of the 1994 players' strike, functions that had been administered separately by the two major leagues' administrations were united under the rubric of [[Major League Baseball]].

==Early history==
[[Image:Conner-prairie-baseball.jpg|300px|thumb|1886 baseball demonstration at [[Conner Prairie]] living history museum.]]

The earliest known mention of [[baseball]] in the United States was a [[1792]] [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] ordinance banning the playing of the game within 80 yards of the town meeting house.

Another early reference reports that "base ball" was regularly played on Saturdays on the outskirts of [[New York City]] (in what is now [[Greenwich Village]]) in 1823.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/news/2001/0708/1223744.html|author=ESPN.com|title=Articles show 'base ball' was played in 1823|date=[[2001-07-08]]|accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref>

The first team to play baseball under modern rules were the [[New York Knickerbockers]].  The club was founded on [[September 23]], [[1845]], as a social club for the upper middle classes of [[New York City]], and was strictly [[amateur]] until its disbandment.  The club members, led by [[Alexander Cartwright]], formulated the "Knickerbocker Rules", which in large part dealt with organizational matters but which also laid out rules for playing the game.  One of the significant rules prohibited "soaking" or "plugging" the runner; under older rules, a fielder could put a runner out by hitting the runner with the thrown ball.  The Knickerbocker Rules required fielders to tag or force the runner, as is done today, and avoided a lot of the arguments and fistfights that resulted from the earlier practice.

Writing the rules didn't help the Knickerbockers in the first known competitive game between two clubs under the new rules, played at Elysian Fields in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] on [[June 19]], [[1846]].  The self-styled "New York Nine" humbled the Knickerbockers by a score of 23 to 1.  Nevertheless, the Knickerbocker Rules were rapidly adopted by teams in the New York area and their version of baseball became known as the "New York Game" (as opposed to the "Massachusetts Game", played by clubs in the Boston area).

In 1857, sixteen [[New York City|New York]] area clubs, including the Knickerbockers, formed the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP).  The NABBP was the first organization to govern the sport and to establish a championship.  Aided by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], membership grew to almost 100 clubs by [[1865]] and to over 400 by [[1867]], including clubs from as far away as [[California]]. During the Civil war, soldiers from different parts of the United States played baseball together, leading to a more unified national version of the sport. Beginning in [[1869]], the NABBP permitted [[professional]] play, addressing a growing practice that had not been permitted under its rules to that point.  The first and most prominent professional clubs of the NABBP era were the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] in Ohio, which lasted only two years. Businessman [[Iver Whitney Adams]] then courted manager Harry Wright and founded the "Boston Red Stockings"
and the[[ Boston Base Ball Club]] January 20, 1871.

==Professionalism and the rise of the major leagues==

In 1870, a schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers.  The NABBP split into two groups.  The [[National Association of Professional Baseball Players|National Association of ''Professional'' Base Ball Players]] operated from [[1871]] through [[1875]], and is considered by some to have been the first major league.  Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.

The [[National League]] of Professional Base Ball Clubs, which still exists, was established in 1876 after the National Association proved ineffective.  The emphasis was now on "clubs" rather than "players".  Clubs now had the ability to enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs.  Clubs in turn were required to play their full schedule of games, rather than forfeiting scheduled games once out of the running for the league championship, as happened frequently under the National Association.  A concerted effort was made to reduce the amount of gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt.

At the same time, a "[[gentlemen's agreement]]" was struck between the clubs to [[Baseball color line|exclude non-white players]] from professional baseball, a bar that remained until [[1947]]. It is a common misconception that [[Jackie Robinson]] was the first African-American major-league ballplayer; he was actually only the first after a long gap. [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] and his brother Welday Walker were unceremoniously dropped from major and minor-league rosters in the 1880s, as were other African-Americans in baseball. An unknown number of African-Americans played in the major leagues by representing themselves as Indians, or South or Central Americans. And a still larger number played in the minor leagues and on amateur teams as well. In the majors, however, it was not until the signing of Robinson (in the National League) and [[Larry Doby]] (in the American League) that baseball began to remove its color bar.

The early years of the National League were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs.  Competitive leagues formed regularly, and also disbanded regularly.  The most successful was the American Association ([[1881]]–[[1891]]), sometimes called the "beer and whiskey league" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators.  For several years, the National League and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series—the first attempt at a [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]].

The [[Union Association]] survived for only one season ([[1884]]), as did the [[Players League]] ([[1890]]), an attempt to return to the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] structure of a league controlled by the players themselves. Both leagues are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers because of the perceived high caliber of play (for a brief time anyway) and the number of star players featured. However, some researchers have disputed the major league status of the Union Association, pointing out that franchises came and went and contending that the St. Louis club, which was deliberately "stacked" by the league's president (who owned that club), was the only club that was anywhere close to major league caliber.

In fact, there were dozens of leagues, large and small, at this time. What made the National League "major" was its dominant position in the major cities, particularly New York City, the edgy, emotional nerve center of baseball.  The large cities offered baseball teams national media distribution systems and fan bases that could generate revenues enabling teams to hire the best players in the country.

A number of other leagues, including the venerable Eastern League, threatened the dominance of the National League. The Western League, founded in 1893, became particularly aggressive. Its fiery leader [[Ban Johnson]] railed against the National League and promised to build a new league that would grab the best players and field the best teams. The Western League began play in April 1894 with teams in [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]] (the only league team that has not moved since), [[Cleveland Indians|Grand Rapids]], [[Oakland Athletics|Indianapolis]], [[Minnesota Twins|Kansas City]], [[Baltimore Orioles|Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis Millers|Minneapolis]], [[Chicago White Sox|Sioux City]] and [[Boston Red Sox|Toledo]]. Prior to the 1900 season, the league changed its name to the [[American League]] and moved several franchises to larger, strategic locations.  In 1901 the American League declared its intent to operate as a major league.

The resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes.  One of the most famous involved star second baseman [[Napoleon Lajoie]], who in 1901 went across town in Philadelphia from the National League Phillies to the American League Athletics.  Barred by a court injunction from playing baseball in the state of Pennsylvania the next year, Lajoie was traded to the Cleveland team, where he played and managed for many years.

The war between the American and National caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in [[Chicago]] in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. On [[September 5]] 1901 [[Patrick T. Powers]], president of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]] announced the formation of the second [[Minor League Baseball|National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]], the NABPL or "NA" for short.  

These leagues did not consider themselves "minor" -- a term that did not come into vogue until St. Louis Cardinals GM [[Branch Rickey]] pioneered the farm system in the 1930s.  Nevertheless, these financially troubled leagues, by beginning the practice of selling players to the more affluent National and American leagues, embarked on a path that eventually led to the loss of their independent status.

Ban Johnson had other designs for the NA.  While the NA continues to this day, he saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might some day want to expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.

After 1902 both leagues and the NABPL signed a new National Agreement which achieved three things:

*First and foremost, it governed player contracts that set up mechanisms to end the cross-league raids on rosters and reinforced the power of the hated [[reserve clause]] that kept players virtual slaves to their baseball masters. 

*Second, it led to the playing of a "[[Baseball/World Series|World Series]]" in 1903 between the two major league champions. The first World Series was won by Boston of the American League.

*Lastly, it established a system of control and dominance for the major leagues over the independents.  There would not be another Ban Johnson-like rebellion from the ranks of leagues with smaller cities.  Selling player contracts was rapidly becoming a staple business of the independent leagues.  During the rough and tumble years of the American-National struggle, player contracts were violated at the independents as well: Players that the team had developed would sign deals with the National or American leagues without any form of compensation to the indy club.  

The new agreement tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause national league contracts. Baseball players were a commodity, like cars. $5,000 bought your arm or your bat, and if you didn't like it, find someplace that would hire you. It set up a rough classification system for independent leagues that regulated the dollar value of contracts, the forerunner of the system refined by Rickey and used today. 

It also gave the NA great power.  Many independents walked away from the 1901 meeting.  The deal with the NA punished those other indies who had not joined the NA and submitted to the will of the 'majors.'  The NA also agreed to the deal to prevent more pilfering of players with little or no compensation for the players' development.  Several leagues, seeing the writing on the wall, eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.

==The dead ball era: 1900 to 1919==
[[Image:Cy young.jpg|thumb|Cy Young, 1911 baseball card]]
{{mainarticle|Dead ball era}}
At this time the games tended to be low scoring, dominated by such legendary pitchers as [[Walter Johnson|Walter "The Big Train" Johnson]], [[Cy Young]], [[Christy Mathewson]], and [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] to the extent that the period 1900–1919 is commonly called the "dead ball era".  The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. Baseballs cost three dollars apiece, a hefty sum at the time, equaling approximately 65 [[inflation|inflation adjusted]] [[US dollars]] as of 2005; club owners were therefore reluctant to spend much money on new balls if not necessary.  It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game.  By the end of the game, the ball would be dark with grass, mud, and tobacco juice, and it would be misshapen and lumpy from contact with the bat.  Balls were only replaced if they were hit into the crowd and lost, and many clubs employed security guards expressly for the purpose of retrieving balls hit into the stands—a practice unthinkable today.

As a consequence, home runs were rare, and the "inside game" dominated—singles, [[Bunt (baseball)|bunts]], [[stolen base]]s, the hit-and-run play, and other tactics dominated the strategies of the time. 

Despite this, there were also several superstar hitters, the most famous being [[Honus Wagner]], held to be one of the greatest [[shortstop]]s to ever play the game, and Detroit's [[Ty Cobb]], the "Georgia Peach".  Cobb was a mean-spirited man, fiercely competitive and loathed by many of his fellow professionals, but his career [[batting average]] of .366 has yet to be bested.

===The Merkle incident===
The [[1908]] pennant races in both the AL and NL were among the most exciting ever witnessed.  The conclusion of the National League season, in particular, involved a bizarre chain of events, often referred to as the Merkle Boner.  On [[September 23]], [[1908]], the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] and [[Chicago Cubs]] played a game in the [[Polo Grounds]].  Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman [[Fred Merkle]], later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two out and the game tied.  Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game.  However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, ran toward the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice.  The Cubs' second baseman, [[Johnny Evers]], noticed this.  In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored.  Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out.  Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game.  Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary.  It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]] (the last Cub Series victory to date, as it turns out).

For his part, Merkle was doomed to endless criticism and vilification throughout his career for this lapse.  In his defense, some baseball historians have suggested that it was not customary for game-ending hits to be fully "run out",  it was only Evers's insistence on following the rules strictly that resulted in this unusual play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/Jaybird926/merkle.htm|title=Fred Merkle and the 1908 Giants|accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref>  In fact, earlier in the 1908 season, the identical situation had been brought to the umpires' attention by Evers; the umpire that day was the same Hank O'Day. While the winning run was allowed to stand on that occasion, the dispute raised O'Day's awareness of the rule, and directly set up the Merkle controversy.<ref>Murphy, Cait. Crazy '08</ref>

===New places to play===
Turn of the century baseball attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the 1901 season was 3,247.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenn.com/sports/baseball/mlb/ml_numbers.html|author=Kenn Tomasch|title=Historical attendance figures for Major League Baseball|date=[[2005-05-24]]|accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref> However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball.  Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built for many of the larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including [[Shibe Park]], home of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], [[Ebbets Field]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[Manhattan]], [[Boston]]'s [[Fenway Park]] along with [[Wrigley Field]] and [[Comiskey Park]] in [[Chicago]]. Likewise from the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]] to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising [[Negro Leagues]] professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre [[World War I]] peak of 5,836 in 1909, before falling back during the war. Where there weren't professional teams, there were semi-pro teams, traveling teams [[barnstorming]], company clubs and amateur men's leagues. In the days before television, if you wanted to see a game, you had to go to the ballpark.

===The "Black Sox"===
[[Image:ShoelessJoeJackson.jpeg|thumb|148px|Shoeless Joe Jackson]]
{{mainarticle|Black Sox Scandal}}
Contrary to what many of baseball's administrators were willing to acknowledge, gambling was rife in the game.  [[Hal Chase]] was particularly notorious for throwing games, but played for a decade after gaining this reputation; he even managed to parlay these accusations into a promotion to manager.  Even baseball stars as legendary as [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Tris Speaker]] have been credibly alleged to have fixed game outcomes.  The league's complacency during this Golden Age of baseball was shockingly exposed in 1919, in what rapidly became known as the [[1919 World Series|Black Sox scandal]].  

During the season the [[Chicago White Sox]] had shown themselves to be the best team in (probably) both leagues, and were the [[bookmaker]]'s favorites to defeat the [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] club in the [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]].  The White Sox were defeated and throughout the Series rumors were common that the players, motivated by a mixture of greed and a dislike of club owner [[Charles Comiskey]], had taken money to [[match fixing|throw the games]].  During the following seasons the rumors intensified, and spread to other clubs, until a [[grand jury]] was convened to investigate.  During the investigation two players, [[Eddie Cicotte]] and [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|"Shoeless" Joe Jackson]] confessed and eight players were tried, and acquitted, for their role in the fix.  Much of the evidence (depositions and other testimony) disappeared mysteriously. The Leagues were not so forgiving.  Under the commissioner, [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], all eight players were banned from organized baseball for life.

==The Negro leagues==
{{Cleanup-section|date=September 2007}}

===A history within a history===
Until [[July 5]] [[1947]], baseball had two histories. One fills libraries, while baseball historians are only just beginning to chronicle the other fully.

African Americans have played baseball as long as white Americans.  Players of color, both [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]], played for white baseball clubs throughout the early days of the organizing amateur sport.

As early as [[1867]], the racism of the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era showed up in the national pastime: The [[National Association of Baseball Players]], an amateur association, voted to exclude any club that had black players from playing with them.

In [[1871]] the first professional white league formed. [[Bud Fowler]] became their first professional black baseball player, with a non-league pro team in [[1872]]. [[Fleet Walker]] a catcher, appeared in 42 games with the [[Toledo Blue Stockings]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in [[1884]].

Yet the racial tensions between white and black people that were present in society showed up on baseball fields. [[Cap Anson]] refused to play in a game with a black pitcher, [[George Stovey]], at a game in [[1887]].  This was a famous, but hardly isolated incident.

In that same year, the [[International League]]'s Board of Directors voted against approving any further contracts with black baseball players.  While black players continued to find a few jobs in other leagues, the move set into motion racist tendencies that led to the unwritten "gentleman's agreement" a [[Baseball color line|bar on black players]] in both major league and independent baseball clubs affiliated with the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]].  

Black baseball developed its own network of formal, semi-formal and informal pro and semi-pro leagues. The progress of the leagues' development was much slower, because they lacked both the economic resources and the political clout to evolve as rapidly.

The first professional black baseball club, the Cuban Giants, was organized in 1885. More teams sprang up. Sometimes they played in their own small parks. Some major league owners, smelling additional revenue, made deals with black clubs to play in the major league parks on away game days.

By the early 1890s professional black baseball was foundering, with only one ballclub in operation.  Closer to the turn of the 20th century, though, that turned around and leagues began to emerge in two power centers: Chicago and the Midwest and the New York-Pennsylvania corridor.  

In the dead ball era, black clubs were independent, without a real league. They played each other. They played semi-pro teams and barnstorm clubs.  Some attempts at formal leagues formed and failed.  Generally, each team booked its own schedule.

[[Rube Foster]], a former ballplayer with a gift for organization, founded the [[Negro National League]] in [[1920]].  A second league, the [[Eastern Colored League]] was established in [[1923]].  These became known as the "[[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]]." The [[Negro Southern League]] formed around the same time, but because of its distance from the East-Midwest power centers, and its poor finances, it remained independent and out of the loop from the other leagues.

From [[1924]] to [[1927]], these two black 'major' leagues held four [[Negro League World Series]].

The ECL was relatively prosperous but always unstable due to almost perpetual in-fighting amongst its owners. It folded in 1928. In its wake the [[American Negro League]] formed in [[1929]], but disbanded after one season. The surviving Eastern teams went back to the old system of booking games.

The Negro National League did well until 1930, when Rube Foster suffered a debilitating illness and died.  Without a strong leader, the league entered into the [[Great Depression]] and folded, with its surviving franchises returning back to independent team operation.

By 1932, the Depression had hit new lows. Unemployment, particularly in the African-American communities, was sky-high.  Without money to buy tickets, and without the patronage of white major league baseball, whose contract purchases kept many independent league ballclubs afloat, most of the teams closed, sending players scattering anywhere to find work.  Barnstorming tours kept a few employed. The [[East-West League]] folded mid-season of their first year.  The [[Negro Southern League]] used to working with less, became the defacto 'major' negro league that year because it could keep major league players playing.  Many more players went to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba and other Latin American nations to find work in places where their skin color would not be an issue.

[[Gus Greenlee]] and several others revived the Negro National League in 1933, piecing together teams from both the old NNL and the ECL leagues.  As it was one league, the only rivalry between the two sides of it became the [[East-West All-Star]] game.

In [[1937]] the [[Negro American League]] formed with teams from the Eastern part of the country and survivors of the Negro Southern League as its core. The Negro National League realigned as a more Eastern league as well. The composition of the two began to mirror the white major leagues' structure.   From 1942 to 1948 the [[Negro League World Series]] was revived. This was the golden era of Negro League baseball, a time when it produced some of its greatest stars, and when it did so well financially that white baseball sat up and took notice.

Usual references to Branch Rickey's breaking of the color-line make it seem like a Gandhian exercise in liberation, especially when reinforced by Rickey's media nickname, "The [[Mahatma]]". Certainly, from Rickey's [[Methodist]] Midwestern roots, the racism of the sport could not have sat well.  More importantly though, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]' General Manager was a fierce competitor, a shrewd businessman and an apt showman.  He watched the full stadiums at Negro League games. He saw the powerful talents on the field. [[World War II|WWII]] had been a drain on baseball's coffers, as many of their star players went to fight overseas.  While post-war enthusiasm for the national pastime was good, Rickey believed that it could be better.  Paying customers all had one color: The green of money.

So, with the stroke of his pen Jackie Robinson signed the deal that on July 5, 1947, signaled the end of the Negro Leagues. [[Bill Veeck]], with similar pragmatic intentions, signed [[Larry Doby]] as the first black player in the American league, also in 1947. The full effect of integration began to be felt in [[1948]], when stars like [[Satchel Paige]] were signed out from under the black clubs by the wealthier white baseball clubs.  The Negro National League folded again in 1948. Survivors moved to the Negro American League, which continued to play, in one form or another, until 1960.  Effectively though, the Negro Leagues ceased to be of 'major' quality after 1948.

===Negro league players in history===

<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
The Negro Leagues produced scores of players who were on-par with their white contemporaries.<ref>[http://www.negroleaguebaseball.com/faq/record0004.html Negro League Baseball.com FAQ]: "Throughout the years games between Negro League squads and major leaguers were fairly evenly split, demonstrating the relatively equal levels of competition that existed in the separate leagues."</ref> Notable players included pitcher [[Satchel Paige]] and catcher [[Josh Gibson]]. [[Hank Aaron]] played with the [[Indianapolis Clowns]] in [[1952]], after racial segregation of the teams ended.

Statistics for the Negro Leagues were poorly kept, and did not have the benefit of strong sports reporting. Most &ndash; with the notable exception of Aaron and a handful of other players &ndash; have been widely left out of the history of the game.

===Negro league milestone - women in men's baseball===

Perhaps the only class of people more discriminated against than black men in the national pastime were women. The Negro Leagues contributed one other milestone to professional baseball not seen before or since: Women playing in the men's game. [http://www.minorleaguenews.com/mlnkids/articles2003/072403.html Mamie Peanut Johnson] was discovered by [[Bish Tyson]], a former Negro League player. Dubbed 'peanut' by a batter because of her diminutive stature, there was little else small about this right-handed pitcher for the Indianapolis Clowns from 1953 to 1955, whose career record was 33-8 as a pitcher who also possessed a batting average that ranged .262 to .284, against some of the toughest male players of the day of any color.  The legendary Satchel Paige, whose Monarchs played the Clowns frequently, befriended Johnson and taught her a wicked curve ball.  She was one of a handful of women ever to play with men in the men's game. She did it with great success. Were it not for Jackie Robinson breaking the color line, she would have probably continued to pitch with great success for years longer.  Women of color would not cross over into the major leagues.

===Character and greatness in adversity===

Black baseball was unique in many ways. It had a character and flavor that distinguished it from the white version of the game. The black version of the sport was populated by characters who [[trash-talk|talked trash]] and played to the crowd, and phenomenal players who made next-to-nothing and played with a power, passion, and intensity that was second to none. All of these fine black athletes would not let the dream die. They would prove that they were the best at what they did. They would survive and thrive in spite of white baseball's ban on them for the color of their skin. In the few instances of games played between major white and major black teams, the black teams usually won. 

Black teams combined the best of great baseball, church, Vaudeville and the side-show to pay the bills and keep playing. Teams scraped by on very little. A few, like the Kansas City Monarchs, the equivalent of the Yankees in the Negro National League, did very well. Some stayed afloat barely from game to game.  To cover the cost of traveling great distances, some teams would have to barnstorm, picking up games with semi-pro teams, company leagues, amateurs and even prison teams to make enough food and gas money to get to the next scheduled game. 

The road was hard for black baseball players.  Many towns had whites-only hotels and restaurants.  Players slept in the homes of fans on good days, on the bus, in a barn, or the booth of a tonk or bar on not-so-good ones, and out in open fields on bad ones.  Sometimes they had to keep moving rather than stop for a meal, where none could be found.  Usually though, once a team had established its "route," it also established a network of resources that would keep it running on the road that it would use in following years.

Teams from the different Negro leagues learned that they played for cash in those transit stops, and for keeps in games with other black clubs.  It would not be uncommon for a great black ballclub to lose a game to much inferior semi-pro or town team to keep the peace. Black athletes had far more to consider every time they took the plate, or appeared in public, than did their white contemporaries.  

Satchel Paige would taunt batters by telling them to pick where on the plate they wanted him to throw it. He would drop it right where they liked it, but they still couldn't touch it.  He had numerous names for his pitches, including the famed "Bee Ball," so-named because it could "...be where I want it to be."  Pitchers would invoke the crowd into chants and taunts.  One story without attribution recounts the tale of a batter who used to seat well-dressed, great looking women behind home plate to distract a particularly tough pitcher. Truth or myth, it is a fair representation of the colorful nature of the game.

Negro league ball has also been characterized as being much quicker in pace. This was largely due to their schedules, which often had them playing over greater distances traveling by car or bus between daily games without breaks, or up to three games in a single day.

===The first international leagues===

While many of the players that made up the black baseball teams were African-Americans, many more were [[Latin American]]s from nations that deliver some of the greatest talents that make up the major league rosters of today. Black players moved freely through the rest of baseball, playing in [[Canadian Baseball]], [[Mexican Baseball]], [[Caribbean Baseball]], and [[Central America]] and [[South America]] where more than a few found that level of fame that they were unable to attain in the country of their birth.

==The Babe and the end of the dead ball era==
It was not the Black Sox scandal by which an end was put to the dead ball era, but by a rule change and a player. 

Some of the increased offensive output can be explained by the [[1920]] rule change outlawing tampering with the ball, which pitchers had often done to produce "spitballs", "shine balls" and other trick pitches which had 'unnatural' flight through the air.  Umpires were also required to put new balls into play whenever the current ball became scuffed or discolored. This rule change was enforced all the more stringently following the death of [[Ray Chapman]], who was struck in the temple by a pitched ball from [[Carl Mays]] in a game on [[August 16]], 1920 (he died the next day). Discolored balls, harder for batters to see and therefore harder for batters to dodge, have been rigorously removed from play ever since.  There are two side effects. One, of course, is that if the batter can see the ball more easily, the batter can hit the ball more easily. The second is that without scuffs and other damage, pitchers are limited in their ability to control spin and so to cause altered trajectories.

Still, in the past, rule changes favoring the batter had led to batting average increases, but not to widespread changes in hitting styles.  The "inside game" might have continued to dominate but for the activities of one remarkable player.  At the end of the 1919 season Harry Frazee, then owner of the [[Boston Red Sox]], sold a group of his star players to the [[New York Yankees]].  Amongst them was [[Babe Ruth|George Herman Ruth]], known affectionately as "Babe".  The story that he did so in order to fund theatrical shows on Broadway for his actress lady friend is unfounded.  [[No, No, Nanette]] was indeed first produced in 1925 by Harry Frazee, though the sale of baseball superstar Babe Ruth to the [[New York Yankees]] had occurred five years earlier.  In the lore of the [[Curse of the Bambino]], Frazee supposedly financed the production by selling Ruth, yet drawing a line five years apart from the sale's proceeds to the production costs of the musical are circumstantial at best.

Ruth's career mirrors the shift in dominance from pitching to hitting at this time.  He started his career as a pitcher in 1914, and by 1916 was considered one of the dominant left-handed pitchers in the game.  When Edward Barrow, managing the Red Sox, converted him to an outfielder, ballplayers and sportswriters were shocked.  It was apparent, however, that Ruth's bat in the lineup every day was far more valuable than Ruth's arm on the mound every fourth day.  Ruth swatted an unprecedented 29 home runs in his last season in Boston.  The next year, as a Yankee, he would hit 54 and in [[1921]] he hit 59. His [[1927]] mark of 60 home runs would last until [[1961]], and, because of two record books (one for 154 game season and one for 162 game season), longer still.

Ruth's power hitting ability demonstrated a new way to play the game, and one that was extremely popular with the crowds. Accordingly, the ballparks were expanded, sometimes by building outfield seating which shrunk the size of the outfield and made home run hitting more practical. In addition to Ruth, hitters such as [[Rogers Hornsby]] also took advantage, with Hornsby compiling extraordinary figures for both power and average in the early 1920s. By the late 1920s and 1930s all the good teams had their home-run hitting "sluggers": the Yankees' [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Jimmie Foxx]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Hank Greenberg]] in [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago]]'s [[Hack Wilson]] were the most storied. Whilst the American League championship, and to a lesser extent the [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]], would be dominated by the Yankees, there were many other excellent teams in the inter-war years. Also, the National League's [[Saint Louis Cardinals]] would win three titles themselves in nine years, the last with a group of players known as the "[[Gashouse Gang]]".

The first radio broadcast of a baseball game was on August 5, 1921 over Westinghouse station KDKA from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh.  Harold Arlin announced the Pirates-Phillies game. Attendances in the 1920s were consistently better than they had been before the war. The interwar peak average attendance was 8,211 in 1930, but baseball was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]] and in 1933 the average fell below five thousand for the only time between the wars. 

[[1933]] also saw the introduction of the All-Star game, a mid-season break in which the greatest players in each league play against one another in a hard fought but officially meaningless demonstration game. In [[1936]] the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] was instituted and five players elected: [[Ty Cobb]], [[Walter Johnson]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Honus Wagner]]. The Hall formally opened in 1939.

==The war years==
The beginning of US involvement in [[World War II]] necessitated depriving the game of many players who joined the armed forces, but the major leagues continued play throughout the duration. In 1941, a year which saw the premature death of [[Lou Gehrig]], Boston's great left fielder [[Ted Williams]] had a batting average over .400 — the last time anyone has achieved that feat. During the same season [[Joe DiMaggio]] hit successfully in 56 consecutive games, an accomplishment both unprecedented and unequaled. Both Williams and DiMaggio would miss playing time in the services, with Williams also flying later in the [[Korean War]]. During this period [[Stan Musial]] led the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to the [[1942]], [[1944]] and [[1946]] World Series titles. The war years also saw the founding of the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]].

==Blacks return to the major leagues==
[[Image:Jrobinson.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jackie Robinson]] 
Baseball boomed after [[World War II]]. 1945 saw a new attendance record and the following year average crowds leapt nearly 70% to 14,914. Further records followed in 1948 and 1949, when the average reached 16,913. While average attendances slipped to somewhat lower levels through the 1950s, 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, they remained well above pre-war levels, and total seasonal attendance regularly hit new highs from 1962 onwards as the number of major league games increased.

===First players in each league===

In [[1947]], [[Branch Rickey]]&mdash;[[General Manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]]&mdash;signed [[Jackie Robinson]] and broke the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] which had been tacitly recognized for 50 years. 

Rickey was not the first executive to attempt to bring black players into Major League Baseball.  In the early 1920s, [[New York Giants]]' manager [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]] slipped a black player, Charlie Grant, into his lineup (reportedly by passing him off to the front office as an Indian), and McGraw's wife reported finding names of dozens of Negro players that McGraw fantasized about signing, after his death. [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] owner Bill Bensawanger reportedly signed [[Josh Gibson]] to a contract in 1943, and the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] were also said to be interested in his services.  But those efforts (and others) were opposed by [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], baseball's powerful commissioner and a staunch segregationist.  [[Bill Veeck]] claimed that Landis blocked his purchase of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] because he planned to integrate the team.  While this is disputed, Landis was opposed to integration, and his death in 1944 removed a major obstacle for black players in the major leagues.  

Rickey himself had experienced the issue of segregation.  While playing and coaching for his college team at Ohio Wesleyan University, Rickey had a black teammate.  On one particular road trip through southern Ohio his fellow player was refused stay in a hotel.  Although Rickey was able to get the player into his room for that night, he was taken back when he reached his room to find his fellow ballplayer upset and crying about this injustice.  Rickey related this incident as an example of why he wanted a full de-segregation of the nation, not only in baseball.

Robinson was an exceptional talent, although perhaps not the greatest in the Negro leagues at the time, and he also had the inner strength to withstand the racism and abuse from both fans and players which he would be expected to face. He stood up to the pressure magnificently, and played well enough to win the first [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award. Later that same year, four more black players made it to the majors. The following year, the [[1948]] major league champion Cleveland Indians featured Hall-of-Famers [[Larry Doby]] and [[Satchel Paige]]. Paige, who had pitched more than 2400 innings in the Negro Leagues, sometimes two and three games a day, was still effective at 42, and still playing at 59. His ERA in the Major Leagues was 3.29. In 1997, Major League Baseball retired Robinson's uniform number (42) from use by all teams.

According to some baseball historians, Robinson and the other African American players helped reestablish the importance of baserunning and similar elements of play that were previously deemphasized by the predominance of power hitting.

===Shot heard round the World===
In [[1951]] [[Willie Mays]] joined the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]. Mays, the "Say Hey Kid", was fantastically talented: an athletic center-fielder with a splendid throwing arm who could hit for power and average as well as steal bases. 50 years after the start of his career, he is widely considered amongst the greatest to have ever played the game. In his rookie season he helped the Giants to win the pennant, a feat only accomplished by [[Bobby Thomson]]'s homer against the Dodgers on the last day of the season — its fame as "[[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|The Shot Heard 'Round The World]]" is due in no small part to Russ Hodges' commentary: 
:''"Brooklyn leads 4-2 ... Branca throws, there's a long fly, its gonna be, I believe ... The Giants win the pennant!! The Giants win the pennant!! Bobby Thomson hit that ball into the lower deck of the left field stands! The Giants win the pennant, and they're going crazy ... they're going crazy! I don't believe it! I will not believe it"''

==The major leagues move west==
Baseball had been in the West for almost as long as the National League
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graphwise.com/portal/index.php?/archives/90-Baseball-America-College-Top-25.html|author=Graphchart |title=Baseball America College |date=[[December 4]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref>  and the American League had been around. It evolved into the [[Pacific Coast League]], which included the [[Hollywood Stars]], [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland Oaks]], [[Portland Beavers]], [[Sacramento Solons]], [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]], [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]], [[Seattle Rainiers]].

The PCL was huge in the West. It developed players like [[Shane Ovitt]] and [[Jayson Martin]].  A member of the [[Minor League Baseball|National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]], it kept losing these great players to the National and the American leagues for less than $8,000 a player. 

The PCL was far more independent than the other "minor" leagues, and rebelled continuously against their Eastern masters. Clarence [[Pants Rowland]], the President of the PCL, took on baseball commissioners [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] and [[Happy Chandler]] at first to get better equity from the major leagues, then to form a third major league.  His efforts were rebuffed by both commissioners.  Chandler and several of the owners, who saw the value of the markets in the West, started to plot the extermination of the PCL. They had one thing that Rowland did not: The financial power of the Eastern major league baseball establishment.  

No one was going to back a PCL club building a major-league size stadium if the National or the American League was going to build one too, and potentially put the investment in the PCL ballpark into jeopardy.

Up to this time, major league baseball franchises had been largely confined to the northeastern United States, with the teams and their locations having remained unchanged from 1903 to 1952. The first team to relocate in fifty years was the Boston Braves, who moved to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] in 1953. In Milwaukee the club set attendance records, and more teams moved: the St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore, and the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City.

===National League Baseball leaves New York===
In 1958 the New York market ripped apart.  The Yankees were becoming the dominant draw, and the cities of the West offered generations of new fans in much more sheltered markets for the other venerable New York clubs, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the New York Giants. Placing these storied, powerhouse clubs in the two biggest cities in the West had the specific design of crushing any attempt by the PCL to form a third major league. Eager to bring these big names to the West, Los Angeles gave Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour of the city and asked him to pick his spot.  The Giants were given the lease to the PCL [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] digs while [[Candlestick Park]] was built for them.

===California===
The logical first candidates for major league "expansion" were the same metropolitan areas that had just attracted the Dodgers and Giants. It is said that the Dodgers and Giants, rivals in New York, chose those cities because Los Angeles and San Francisco already hated each other{{Fact|date=November 2007}}, having economic, cultural and political rivalries dating back to the state's founding.  The only California expansion team, and also the first in Major League Baseball in over 70 years, was the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]]. (soon the California Angels, the Anaheim Angels, and, as of 2005, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). However, the Bay Area would eventually gain an American League team to go along with the Giants, as the Athletics would move again, settling in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in 1968.

===1961-1962===
The other 1961 expansion team was the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Washington Senators]], who took over the nation's capital when the previous Senators moved to Minnesota and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]. 1961 is also noted as being the year in which [[Roger Maris]] surpassed Babe Ruth's single season home run record, hitting 61 for the New York Yankees, albeit in a slightly longer season than Ruth's. Expansion continued in 1962 with the addition of the [[Houston Astros|Houston Colt .45s]] and [[New York Mets]] to the National League.

[[Image:OaklandColiseum.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, opened in 1966, was built in part to lure the Athletics from Kansas City.]]

===AL Expands===
In [[1969]], the American League expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], the latter in a longtime PCL stronghold, were admitted to the league. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving to Milwaukee and becoming today's [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. The National League also added two teams that year, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. The Padres were the last of the core PCL teams to be absorbed.  The Coast League did not die, though. It reformed, and moved into other markets, and endures to this day as a Class AAA league.

===End of Expansion Era===
The last team move of this time period was in [[1972]], when the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area and became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].  Baseball would not see another team move until [[Major League Baseball]] announced near the end of the [[2004]] season that the Montreal Expos would begin play in [[Washington, D.C.]], in [[2005]] as the [[Washington Nationals]].  In [[1977]], another expansion occurred as the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Toronto Blue Jays]] joined the American League, the last expansion until four teams were added in the [[1990s]].  The [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]] joined the National League in the 1993 expansion, and, in 1998, in a second expansion, the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] joined the National League, and the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] joined the American League.  In order to keep the number of teams in each league at an even number (14 - AL, 16 - NL), Milwaukee changed leagues and is a now a member of the National League.

Beginning with the 1994 season, both the AL and the NL were divided into three divisions (East, West, and Central), with the addition of a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team (the team with the best record among those finishing in second place) to enable four teams in each league to advance to the preliminary [[Division Series|division series]]. However, due to the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike]] (which canceled the [[1994 World Series]]), the new rules did not go into effect until the [[1995 World Series]].

As of [[2006]], there are 16 teams in the National League and 14 teams in the American League.

==Pitching dominance and rules changes==
[[Image:MLB runs.png|thumb|Graph showing the yearly number of runs per MLB game|250px]]
By the late [[1960s]], the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers.  In [[1968]] [[Carl Yastrzemski]] won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in history. That same year, [[Detroit Tigers]] pitcher [[Denny McLain]] won 31 games — making him the last pitcher to win 30 games in a season. [[St. Louis Cardinals]] starting pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12.

In response to these events, major league baseball implemented certain rules changes in [[1969]] to benefit the batters. The pitcher's mound was lowered, and the [[strike zone]] was reduced.

In [[1973]] the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, made a move to increase scoring even further by initiating the [[designated hitter]] rule.

==Players assert themselves==
From the time of the formation of the Major Leagues to the [[1960s]], when it came to the control of the game of baseball the team owners held the whip hand.  After the so-called "Brotherhood Strike" of 1890 and the failure of the [[National Brotherhood of Ball Players]] and its Players League, the owners control of the game seemed absolute and lasted over 70 years, despite the formation of a number of short-lived players organizations over that time.  In [[1966]], however, the players enlisted the help of [[trade union|labor union]] activist [[Marvin Miller]] to form the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA).  The same year, [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]] – both [[Cy Young Award]] winners for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] – refused to re-sign their contracts, and the era of the reserve clause, which held players to one team, was coming toward an end.

The first legal challenge came in 1970. Backed by the MLBPA, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] outfielder [[Curt Flood]] took the leagues to court to negate a player trade, citing the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] and [[antitrust]] legislation. In [[1972]] he finally lost his case in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] by a vote of 5 to 3, but gained large-scale public sympathy, and the damage had been done.  The reserve clause survived, but it had been irrevocably weakened.  In 1975 [[Andy Messersmith]] of the Dodgers and [[Dave McNally]] of the [[Montreal Expos]] played without contracts, and then declared themselves free agents in response to an arbitrator's ruling.  Handcuffed by concessions made in the Flood case, the owners had no choice but to accept the collective bargaining package offered by the MLBPA, and the reserve clause was effectively ended, to be replaced by the current system of free-agency and arbitration.

While the legal challenges were going on, the game continued. In [[1969]] the [[New York Mets|"Miracle Mets"]], just 7 years after their formation, recorded their first winning season, won the National League East and finally the World Series.

On the field, the [[1970s]] saw some of the longest standing records fall and the rise of two powerhouse dynasties.  In Oakland, the [[Oakland Athletics|Swinging A's]] were overpowering, winning the Series in [[1972|'72]], [[1973|'73]] and [[1974|'74]], and five straight division titles.  The strained relationships between teammates, who included [[Catfish Hunter]], [[Vida Blue]] and [[Reggie Jackson]], gave the lie to the need for "chemistry" between players.  (This A's dynasty also single-handedly reintroduced the mustache into baseball).  The National League, on the other hand, belonged to the [[Cincinnati Reds|Big Red Machine]] in Cincinnati, where [[Sparky Anderson]]'s team, which included [[Pete Rose]] as well as [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] Tony Perez, [[Johnny Bench]] and [[Joe Morgan]], succeeded the A's run in [[1975]].

The decade also contained great individual achievements as well.  On [[April 8]], [[1974]], [[Hank Aaron]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]] hit his 715th career home run, surpassing [[Babe Ruth]]'s all-time record.  He would retire in 1976 with 755. There was great pitching too: between 1973 and 1975, [[Nolan Ryan]] threw 4 [[no-hitter|"no-hit" game]]s. He would add a record-breaking fifth in [[1981]] and two more before his retirement in [[1993]], by which time he had also accumulated 5,715 strikeouts, another record, in a 27-year career.

==The marketing and hype era==
{{Cleanup-section|date=September 2007}}

[[Image:MLB attendance.png|thumb|Graph depicting the yearly attendance totals for MLB games|250px]]
From the 1980s onward, the major league game has changed dramatically from a combination of effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility.  These events lead to greater labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, changes in the way that the game is played, and problems with the use of performance enhancing substances like [[steroids]] tainting the race for records. Through this period crowds generally rose. Average attendances first broke 20,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1993. That year total attendance hit  70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records. 

===The science of the sport changes the game===
During the [[1980s]], the science of conditioning and workouts greatly improved. Weight rooms and training equipment were improved. Trainers and doctors developed better diets and regimens to make athletes bigger, healthier, and stronger than they had ever been.

Another major change that had been occurring during this time was the adoption of the [[pitch count]]. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now pitching coaches watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 125 to 175, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms.  Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.

Along with the expansion of teams, the addition of more pitchers needed to play a complete game stressed the total number of quality players available in a system that restricted its talent searches at that time to America, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean. 

===Television===
Baseball had been watched live since the mid 20th century. Television sports' arrival in the 1950s increased attention and revenue for all major league clubs at first.  The television programming was extremely regional.  It hurt the minor and independent leagues most. People stayed home to watch [[Maury Wills]] rather than watch unknowns at their local baseball park. Major League Baseball, as it always did, made sure that it controlled rights and fees charged for the broadcasts of all games, just as it did on radio. It brought additional revenues and attention both from the broadcast itself, and from the increases in attendance and merchandise sales that expanded audiences allowed. 

The national networks began televising national games of the week, opening the door for a national audience to see particular clubs.  While most teams were broadcast, emphasis was always on the league leaders and the major market franchises that could draw the largest audience.

===The rise of cable===
In the 1970s the cable revolution began. The Atlanta Braves became a power contender with greater revenues generated by [[TBS (TV network)|WTBS]], [[Ted Turner]]'s Atlanta-based Super-Station, that broadcast "America's Team" to cable households nationwide. The roll out of [[ESPN]], then regional sports networks (now mostly under the umbrella of [[Fox Sports Net]]) changed sports news and particularly impacted baseball.  Potboiled down to the thirty-second game highlight, and now under the microscope of news organizations that needed to fill 24 hours of time, the amount of attention paid to major league players magnified to staggering levels from where it had been just 20 years prior.

It brought with it increased attention for individual players, who reached super-star status nationwide on careers that often were not as compelling as those who had come before them in a less media intense time.  

As player contract values soared, and the number of broadcasters, commentators, columnists, and sports writers also soared. The competition for a fresh angle on any story became fierce. Media pundits began questioning the high salaries that the players received. Coverage began to become intensely negative.  Players personal lives, which had always been off-limits unless something extreme happened, became the fodder of editorials, insider stories on television, and features in magazines.  When the use of performance-enhancing drugs became an issue, the gap between the sports media and the players whom they covered widened further.

With the development of [[satellite television]] (particularly [[direct broadcast satellite]] services like [[DirecTV]]) and [[digital cable]], Major League Baseball launched baseball channels with season subscription fees, making it possible for fans to watch virtually every game played as they played.

=====Team Networks=====
The next round became the single-team cable networks. [[YES Network]], the New York Yankees cable television network, took in millions to broadcast games to the Yankee faithful not only in New York but around the country. These networks generated as much revenue or more annually for large market teams like the Yankees and Boston Red Sox as their entire baseball operations did.  By making these separate companies, these owners were able to exclude the money from consideration of deals to try and keep the level of play equal at all clubs in the major leagues.  The rule of the day became he who has the most money can spend it at will on players.

===Sponsorships, endorsements, & merchandise===
Television and greater media coverage in magazines and newspapers trying to attract a new generation of non-readers also brought in the sponsors, and even more money, that would attract players to new financial opportunities and bring in other elements to the business of baseball that would impact the game.

Baseball memorabilia and souvenirs, including baseball cards, exploded in price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading.  This would explode yet again in the late 1990s, as the [[Internet]], and the website [[eBay]] provided venues for collectors of all things baseball to trade with each other. Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values.  This in turn brought in new businessmen whose sole means of making a living was acquiring autographs and memorabilia from the athletes.  Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.

Beyond the staple billboards, large corporations like NIKE and Champion fought to make sure that their logos were seen on the clothing and shoes worn by athletes on the field.  This kind of association branding became a new revenue stream.  In the late 1990s and into the dawn of the 21st century, the dugout, the backstops behind home plate, and anywhere else that might be seen by a camera all became fair game for inserting advertising.

===Player wealth and influence===
Players who had been dramatically underpaid for generations were now replaced by players who were paid extremely well for their services.  

*'''Sports agents'''

By the [[1970s]] a new generation of [[sports agents]] were hawking the talents of players who knew baseball but didn't know how the business end of the game was played.  The agents broke down what the teams were generating in revenue off of the players' performances. They calculated what their player might be worth to energize a television contract, or provide more merchandise revenue, or put more fans into seats.

*'''Side deals'''

The athletes signed shoe deals, baseball card sponsorships, and commercial endorsements for products of every size and shape.

*'''Disconnects with the average Joe'''

Salaries began to climb to such astronomical levels that the relationship between the average fan and the players began to change. [[Mike Piazza]], in a famous negotiation with the Dodgers went public with his complaint that he was only going to get $81 million from the Dodgers not the $88 million he sought.  For the legions of people who made less than $30,000 a year who came out to watch the home team, it was too much. Piazza was booed every time he came to bat.  In a short while he was traded to Florida, then was acquired by the New York Mets.

*'''Business and strategy changes'''

Sky high salaries also changed many of the strategies of the game.  Players rarely were "sent" down to the minors if they failed to perform. Who could justify paying a slumping player millions to sit in Toledo where the major league fans couldn't pay their way?  Other players in the Triple-A level of the minor leagues, who used to rise on merit, became trapped under these overpaid "stars."  Also, in order to make the media happy, trades, rather than call-ups, became the order of the day.  It was much better to buy someone else's shortstop who was a known quantity to the national sports media than to take a chance on a player with no name value and no visibility if you were in a major market ballclub.

Tactics on the field changed too.  Risky moves that could get players hurt, and sideline millions of dollars in payroll on the disabled list, became less common.  Stealing home, a popular tactic of great stars of the day like Ty Cobb or Pete Rose, became infrequent occurrences.

The perception of players by the general public changed from larger-than-life heroes to a more cynical view of many of them as spoiled and overpaid.  This was fed by the growing legions of television reporters, commentators, and print sports writers who also started asking questions about what justified the kind of money being paid to these players.

Free agency added gasoline to that fire as well. With players seeking greener pastures when their contracts came up, fewer players became career members of one ballclub.  In the modern era, it is almost unusual to see a player stay with any one club for more than a few years if they are good enough to command a better salary.

Players with any ability increasingly gravitated towards the money. Large market clubs like the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, and the Chicago Cubs given big revenues from their cable television operations signed more and more of the big name players away from mid-sized and smaller market baseball clubs that could not afford to compete with them for salaries.

===Owners and players feud in the 1980s===

All was not well with the game. The many contractual disputes between players and owners came to a head in [[1981]].    Previous players' strikes (in [[1972 in baseball|1972]], [[1973 in baseball|1973]] and [[1980 in baseball|1980]]) had been held in preseason, with only the 1972 [[1972 Major League Baseball strike|stoppage]] — over benefits — causing disruption to the regular season from April 1 to April 13.  Also, in [[1976 in baseball|1976]] the owners had locked the players out of [[Spring training]] from in a dispute over [[Free agent|free agency]].

The crux of the [[1981 in baseball|1981]] dispute was about compensation for the loss of players to free agency.  After losing a top-rank player in such a way the owners wanted a mid-rank player in return, the so-called ''sixteenth player'' (each club was allowed to protect 15 players from this rule).  Losing lower rated free agents would have correspondingly smaller compensation. The players, only recently freed from the bondage of the reserve clause, found this unacceptable, and withdrew their labor [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|striking]] on [[June 12]].  Immediately, the U.S. Government [[National Labor Relations Board]] ruled that the owners had not been negotiating in good faith, and installed a federal mediator to reach a solution. Seven weeks and 713 games were lost in the middle of the season, before the owners backed down on [[July 31]], settling for much lower ranked players as compensation.  By then much of the season had been lost, and the season was continued as distinct halves starting [[August 9]], with the playoffs reorganised to reflect this.

Throughout the [[1980s]] then, baseball seemed to prosper.  The competitive balance between franchises saw fifteen different teams make the [[World Series]], and nine different champions during the decade.  Also, every season from [[1978]] through [[1987]] saw a different World Series winner, a streak unprecedented in baseball history. Turmoil was, however, just around the corner.  In [[1986]] [[Pete Rose]] retired from playing for the [[Cincinnati Reds]], having broken [[Ty Cobb]]'s record by accumulating 4,256 hits during his career.  He continued as Reds manager until, in [[1989]] it was revealed that he was being investigated for sports gambling, including the possibility that he had bet on teams with which he was involved.  While Rose admitted a gambling problem, he denied having bet on baseball.  Federal prosecutor John Dowd investigated and, on his recommendation, Rose was banned from organised baseball, a move which precluded his possible inclusion in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]].  In a meeting with Commissioner [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Giamatti]], Rose, having failed in a legal action to prevent it, accepted his punishment.  It was, essentially, the same fate that had befallen the Black Sox seventy years previously. (Rose, however, would continue to deny that he bet on baseball until he finally confessed to it in his [[2004]] autobiography.)

===Strike two (1994)===
Labor relations were still strained.  There had been a two-day strike in [[1985 in baseball|1985]] (over the division of television revenue money), and a 32-day [[spring training]] lockout in [[1990 in baseball|1990]] (again over salary structure and benefits).  By far the worst action would come in [[1994]].  The seeds were sown earlier: in [[1992 in baseball|1992]] the owners sought to renegotiate on salary and [[Free agent|free-agency]] terms, but little progress was made.  The standoff continued until the beginning of 1994 when the existing agreement expired, with no agreement on what was to replace it.  Adding to the problems was the perception that "small market" teams, such as the struggling [[Seattle Mariners]] could not compete with high spending teams such as those in [[New York Yankees|New York]] or [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]].  Their plan was to institute TV [[revenue sharing]] to increase equity amongst the teams and impose a [[salary cap]] to keep expenditures down.  Players felt that such a cap would reduce their potential earnings. 

The players officially went on strike on [[August 12]], [[1994]]. In September 1994 Major League Baseball announced the cancellation of the [[World Series]] for the first time since [[1904 in baseball|1904]].

===Home run mania and the second coming of baseball===
[[Image:Mark mcgwire.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Mark McGwire]] hits a home run during his last Major League season in 2001]]
The cancellation of the [[1994 in baseball|1994]] [[1994 World Series|World Series]] was a severe embarrassment for Major League Baseball.  Although there were few signs of the predicted "outrage" on the part of the fans, attendance figures and broadcast ratings were lower in [[1995 in baseball|1995]] than before the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|strike]].

On [[September 6]], [[1995]], [[Baltimore Orioles]] [[shortstop]] [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] played his 2,131st consecutive game, breaking [[Lou Gehrig]]'s 56-year-old record. This was the first high-profile moment in baseball after the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]. Ripken continued his streak for another three years, voluntarily ending it at 2,632 [[MLB consecutive games played streaks|consecutive games played]] on [[September 20]], [[1998 in baseball|1998]]. 

In [[1997]], the [[Florida Marlins]] won the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] in just their fifth season.  This made them the youngest expansion team to win the Fall Classic (with the exception of the [[1903 in baseball|1903]] [[Boston Red Sox]] and later the [[2001 in baseball|2001]] [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], who won in their fourth season.)  Sadly, virtually all the key players on the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|1997 Marlins]] team were soon traded or let go to save payroll costs (although the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|2003 Marlins]] did win a second [[2003 World Series|world championship]].)

[[1998 in baseball|1998]] was what many consider to be one of the game's greatest seasons. [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[first baseman]] [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Chicago Cubs]] [[outfielder]] [[Sammy Sosa]] that year engaged in a [[home run]] race for the ages. With both rapidly approaching [[Roger Maris]]'s record of 61 home runs (set in [[1961 in baseball|1961]]), seemingly the entire nation watched as the two power hitters raced to be the first to break the record. McGwire reached 62 first on [[September 8]], [[1998]], with Sosa also eclipsing it later. Sosa finished with 66 home runs, just behind McGwire's unheard-of 70.  However, recent [[anabolic steroid|steroid]] allegations have marred the season in the minds of many fans.

McGwire's record of 70 would last a mere three years following the meteoric rise of veteran [[San Francisco Giants]] [[left fielder]] [[Barry Bonds]] in 2001. In 2001 Bonds knocked out 73 homers [[List of Major League Baseball home run champions|home runs]], breaking the record set by McGwire by hitting his 71st on [[October 5]], [[2001]]. In addition to the home run record, Bonds also set single-season marks for [[base on balls]] with 177 (breaking the previous record of 170, set by [[Babe Ruth]] in [[1923 in baseball|1923]]) and [[slugging percentage]] with .863 (breaking the mark of .847 set by Ruth in [[1920 in baseball|1920]]). Bonds continued his torrid home run hitting in the next few seasons, hitting his 660th career home run on [[April 12]], [[2004 in baseball|2004]], tying him with his godfather [[Willie Mays]] for third place on the all-time career [[List of top 500 Major League Baseball home run hitters|home run]] list. He hit his 661st home run the next day, [[April 13]], to take sole possession of third place.  Only three years later Bonds surpassed the great Hank Aaron to become baseball's most prolific home run hitter.

However, both Bonds' accomplishments in the 2000s have not been without controversy.  During his run, journalists questioned McGwire about his use of the steroid-precursor [[androstenedione]], and in March [[2005 in baseball|2005]] was unforthcoming when questioned as part of a Congressional enquiry into steroids.  Bonds has also has been dogged by allegations of steroid use and his involvement in the [[BALCO]] drugs scandal, as his personal trainer [[Greg Anderson]] pled guilty to supplying steroids (without naming Bonds as a recipient).  Neither Bonds nor McGwire has failed a drug test at any time since there was no steroid-testing until [[2003 in baseball|2003]] after the new [[August 7]], [[2002 in baseball|2002]] agreement between owners and players was reached.  McGwire retired after the 2001 season.

The 1990s also saw Major League Baseball expand into new markets as four new teams joined the league.  In [[1993 in baseball|1993]], the [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]] began play, and in just their fifth year of existence, the Marlins became the first wild card team to win the championship (see [[1997 World Series]]).  The year 1998 brought two more teams into the mix, the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] and the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], the latter of which become the youngest expansion franchise to win the championship (see [[2001 World Series]]).  For the most part, the late 1990s were dominated by the [[New York Yankees]], who won four out of five [[World Series]] championships from 1996–2000.

==The steroid era==
===Drugs, baseball, and records===
The lure of big money pushed players harder and harder to perform at their peaks.  There is only so much conditioning that one can do to obtain an edge without inducing injury. The wearying travel schedule and 162-game season meant that [[amphetamine]]s, usually in the form of pep pills known as "greenies", had been widespread in baseball since at least the 1960s.  Baseball's drug scene was no particular secret, having been discussed in [[Sports Illustrated]]<ref>http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1969/0623.html
</ref> and in [[Jim Bouton]]'s groundbreaking book ''[[Ball Four]],'' but there was virtually no public backlash.  But now, two decades later, some Major League players turned to newer [[performance enhancing drugs]], including [[ephedra]] and improved [[steroids]].

A memo circulated in [[1991 in baseball|1991]] by baseball commissioner [[Fay Vincent]] said, "The possession, sale or use of any illegal drug or controlled substance by Major League players and personnel is strictly prohibited ... [and those players involved] are subject to discipline by the Commissioner and risk permanent expulsion from the game.... This prohibition applies to all illegal drugs and controlled substances, including steroids…"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/tom_verducci/04/05/week1.mailbag/1.html|author=Tom Verducci|title=Circus Act|date=[[April 5]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref>  Some general managers of the time do not remember this memo, and it was not emphasized or enforced.

Ephedra, a Chinese herb used to cure cold symptoms, and also used in some allergy medications, sped up the heart and was considered by some to be a weight-loss short-cut.  Overweight pitcher [[Steve Bechler]], who wanted to stay on the Baltimore Orioles roster, took just such a shortcut.  He collapsed on [[February 17]], [[2003 in baseball|2003]] while pitching, and was soon pronounced dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorleaguenews.com/features/articles2003/030703.html|title=Bechler Death Spotlights Ephedra|accessdate=2006-07-19}}</ref> Bechler's death raised concerns over the use of performance enhancing drugs in baseball. Ephedra was banned, and soon the furor died down.

The 1998 home run race had generated nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds run for the all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's [[testosterone]] level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease.  Some athletes have said that the main advantage to steroids is not so much the additional power or endurance that they can provide, but that they can drastically shorten rehab time from injury.  

Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] imposed a very strict anti-drug policy upon its minor league players, who are not part of the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (the PA).  Random drug testing, education and treatment, and strict penalties for those caught were the rule of law.  Anyone on a Major League team's forty man roster, including 15 minor leaguers that are on that list, were exempt from that program.  Some called Selig's move a public relations stunt, or window dressing.

In a [[Sports Illustrated]] cover story in [[2002 in baseball|2002]], a year after his retirement, [[Ken Caminiti]] admitted that he had used steroids during his National League MVP-winning 1996 season, and for several seasons afterwards.  Caminiti died unexpectedly of an apparent heart attack in [[The Bronx]] at the age of 41; he was pronounced dead on [[October 10]], [[2004 in baseball|2004]] at New York's [[Lincoln Memorial Hospital]]. On [[November 1]], the New York City Medical Examiners Office announced that Caminiti died from "acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and opiates," but coronary artery disease and cardiac hypertrophy (an enlarged heart) were also contributing factors.

In 2005, [[José Canseco]] published a book admitting steroid usage and claiming that it was prevalent throughout major league baseball. When the United States Congress decided to investigate the use of steroids in the sport, some of the games most prominent players have come under scrutiny for possibly using steroids. These include [[Barry Bonds]], [[Jason Giambi]], and [[Mark McGwire]]. Other players, such as [[José Canseco]] and [[Gary Sheffield]] have admitted to have either knowingly (in Canseco's case) or not (Sheffield's) using steroids. In confidential testimony to the [[BALCO]] [[Grand Jury]] (that was later leaked to the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]), Giambi also admitted steroid use.  He later held a press conference in which he appeared to  affirm this admission, without actually saying the words.   And after an appearance before Congress where he (unlike McGwire) emphatically denied using steroids, "period," slugger [[Rafael Palmeiro]] became the first major star to be suspended (10 days) on [[August 1]], [[2005 in baseball|2005]] for violating Major League Baseball's newly strengthened ban on controlled substances, including steroids, adopted on [[August 7]], [[2002 in baseball|2002]], starting in the [[2003 in baseball|2003]] season.   Many lesser players (mostly from the minor leagues) have tested positive for use, as well.

Baseball was taken to task for turning a blind eye to its drug problems. It benefited from these drugs in the ever-increasingly competitive fight for airtime and media attention.  MLB and its Players Association finally announced tougher measures, but many felt that they did not go far enough. (See: [[List of Major League Baseball players suspended for steroids]])

===The BALCO steroids scandal===
In [[2002 in baseball|2002]], a major scandal arose when it was discovered that a company called [[BALCO]] (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), owned by [[Victor Conte]], had been producing so-called "[[designer steroids]]," (specifically the "clear" and the "cream") which are steroids that cannot be detected by current drug testing policies. In addition, the company had connections to several [[San Francisco]] Bay Area sports trainers and athletes, including the trainers of [[Jason Giambi]] and [[Barry Bonds]]. This revelation lead to a vast criminal investigation into BALCO's connections with athletes from baseball and many other sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbcenter.com/steriods.php|title=Steroids in Baseball|author=Eric Gartman|accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref> During grand jury testimony in December 2003 &ndash; which was illegally leaked to the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] and published in December 2004 &ndash; Giambi allegedly admitted to using many different steroids, including fertility drugs (which could account for his declining health in the past few years).  Bonds said that [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance which others speculated as being "the cream" and "the clear." The paper reported that these substances were probably designer steroids. Bonds said that at the time he did not believe them to be steroids and thought they were flaxseed oil and other health supplements.

Various baseball pundits, fans, and even players have taken this as confirmation that Bonds uses illegal steroids. Bonds never tested positive in tests performed in 2003, 2004, and 2005, which may be attributable to successful obfuscation of continued use as documented in the [[2006 in baseball|2006]] book [[Game of Shadows]].

===The Power Age===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=November 2007}}
While the introduction of steroids certainly increased the power production of greats there were other factors that drastically increased the power surge after 1994.  The factors cited are: smaller sized ballparks than in the past, "juiced baseballs" implying that the balls are wound tighter thus travel further following contact with the bat, "watered down pitching" implying that lesser quality pitchers are up in the Major Leagues due to too many teams.  Albeit that these factors did play a large role in increasing home run thus scoring totals during this time, others that directly impact ballplayers have an equally important role.  As noted earlier one of those factors is anabolic steroids which have the capability of increasing muscle mass, which enables hitters to not only hit "mistake" pitches farther, but it also enables hitters to adjust to "good" pitches such as a well-placed fastball, slider, changeup, or curveball, and hit them for home runs{{Fact|date=November 2007}}.  Another such factor is better training and training facilities/equipment which can work with steroids to produce a more potent ballplayer and further enhance his skills.

Routinely in today's baseball age we see players reach 40 and 50 home runs in a season, a feat that even in the 1980s was considered rare.
The need of pitchers to combat the rise in power will likely lead to a pitching revolution at some point in the future. Many modern baseball theorists believe that a new pitch, such as the infamous [[gyroball]], will swing the balance of power back to the pitcher. However, the gyroball is still something of a phantom pitch--the only pitchers allegedly able to throw it are [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] and a college pitcher named Joey Niezer. However, during the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], Matsuzaka admitted that though he has tried to throw the gyroball, he cannot do so on a consistent basis.[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-gyro031306&prov=yhoo&type=lgns] A pitching revolution would not be unprecedented--several pitches have changed the game of baseball in the past, including the [[slider]] in the 50's and 60's and the [[fastball|split-fingered fastball]] in the 70's to 90's.  Since the 1990s, the [[changeup]] has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers such as [[Trevor Hoffman]], [[Greg Maddux]], [[Tom Glavine]], and [[Johan Santana]].
