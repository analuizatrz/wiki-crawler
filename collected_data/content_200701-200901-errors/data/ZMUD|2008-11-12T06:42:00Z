'''Zugg's MUD Client''' ('''zMUD''') is a [[MUD client]] developed by [[Zuggsoft]]. It was first developed in 1995, and was made into [[shareware]] in 1996.  It supports several enhancements to standard [[telnet]] such as the [[MUD eXtension Protocol]] (MXP), the [[MUD Compression Protocol]] (MCCP), [[MUD Sound Protocol]] (MSP) and features advanced mapping capabilities.

A new client has been released by Zugg and continues development, named [[CMUD]], which officially supports Vista.
