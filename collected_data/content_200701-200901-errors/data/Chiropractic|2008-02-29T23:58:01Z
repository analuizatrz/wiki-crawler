'''Chiropractic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chiro-'' χειρο- "hand-" + ''praktikós'' πρακτικός "concerned with action") is a complementary and alternative medicine [[health care]] [[Health care provider|profession]] whose purpose is to diagnose and treat mechanical disorders of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and [[musculoskeletal system]]  with the intention of affecting the [[nervous system]] and improving [[health]]. Chiropractic uses manual treatments including [[spinal adjustment]] and other joint and [[soft-tissue]] manipulation.<ref name="ccestandards">{{cite web |url=http://cce-usa.org/uploads/File/2007%20January%20STANDARDS.pdf |format=PDF |title= Standards for Doctor of Chiropractic programs and requirements for institutional status |author= [[Council on Chiropractic Education]] |date=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> Historically, it is based on the premise that a [[vertebral subluxation]] or [[Vertebral column|spinal joint]] dysfunction can interfere with the nervous system and result in many different conditions of diminished health.

Chiropractors, known as [[Doctor of Chiropractic|Doctors of Chiropractic]] or chiropractic doctors/physicians, in some jurisdictions,<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos071.htm]</ref><ref>[http://www23.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/2001/e/groups/3122.shtml]</ref>  use a combination of treatments which are predicated on the specific needs of the individual patient. A chiropractor can develop and carry out a comprehensive treatment/management plan which can include [[spinal adjustment]]s, [[soft tissue therapy]], prescription of exercises, and health and lifestyle counseling.<ref name="What Is Chiropractic">[http://chiropractic.on.ca/ChiropracticCare/WhatisChiropractic.aspx What Is Chiropractic?]</ref>

Chiropractic was founded in [[1895]] by [[Daniel David Palmer|D. D. Palmer]] in the [[United States of America|USA]], and is now practiced in more than 100 countries.<ref name="fclb-qa">Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, Questions and Answers about Professional Regulation and the Chiropractic Profession, ''Where are chiropractors regulated?'', January 9, 2006.[http://www.fclb.org/Q&A.htm#Q2 available online]</ref><ref name="diplomatic">Michel Tetrault, DC, ''Country Chiropractic Support'', Chiropractic Diplomatic Corps.

Chiropractors have historically fallen into two main groups, "straights" and "mixers"; both have had splinter groups.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/><ref name=History-PPC/> Significant differences regarding [[Scope of Practice|scope of practice]], claims made about spinal manipulation, and beliefs regarding professional integration, differentiate the various schools of thought and practice styles held within the profession.<ref name="Healey"/>

== Philosophy ==
Contemporary chiropractic belief systems vary along a spectrum that ranges from deduction from [[vitalism|vitalistic]] roots to the [[materialism]] of science. Between these two extremes can be found principles such as "vitalism, [[holism]], [[naturalism]], therapeutic conservatism, [[critical rationalism]], and thoughts from the [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] and [[humanistic]] paradigms."<ref name=Phillips-PPC>{{cite book |author= Phillips RB |chapter= The evolution of vitalism and materialism and its impact on philosophy |pages=65–76 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref>

[[Vitalism]], the belief that living things contain an element that cannot be explained through matter, and [[materialism]], the belief that all things have material explanations, have been debated since the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], continuing into the 20th century, legally and politically differentiating early chiropractic from [[allopathic]] medicine and thereby helping ensure professional autonomy.<ref name=Keating05>{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic |pages=77–98 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> Today's individual chiropractor balances this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] by emphasizing both the tangible, testable principle that structure affects function, and the untestable, metaphorical recognition that life is self-sustaining.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> The chiropractor's purpose is to foster the establishment and maintenance of an organism-environment dynamic that is the most conducive to functional well-being of the person as a whole.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/>

Whether [[vitalist]], [[naturalist]], or [[materialist]], a holistic practitioner takes a patient-centered approach,  appreciates the multifactorial nature of influences (i.e. structural, chemical, and psychological) on the functioning of the body in health and disease, and recognizes the dynamics and interplay between lifestyle, environment, and health.  Holism is not unique to chiropractic philosophy, as it pervades throughout most [[complementary and alternative medicine|complementary and alternative methods]] and the allied health care professions.  This is also consistent with the [[biopsychosocial]] approach emphasized by both chiropractic and medicine.  Chiropractors retain, [[naturopathic]] and naturalist models that suggest decreased "host resistance" of the body facilitates the disease process and that natural interventions are preferable towards strengthening the host in its effort to optimize function and return to [[homeostasis]].<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> Chiropractic care primarily uses manipulation rather than medications and surgery.<ref>{{cite book |editor= Mootz RD, Hansen DT |title= Chiropractic technologies |publisher= Jones & Bartlett |date=1999 |isbn=0834213737 |author= Hansen DT, Mootz RD |chapter= Formal processes in health care technology assessment: a primer for the chiropractic profession |pages=3–17}}</ref>

Chiropractors also commonly use nutrition, exercise, patient education, health promotion and lifestyle counseling as part of their holistic outlook towards preventive health care.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |title= A survey of practice patterns and the health promotion and prevention attitudes of US chiropractors, maintenance care: part I |author= Rupert RL |doi=10.1016/S0161-4754(00)90107-6 |pmid=10658870}}</ref> Chiropractic's claim to improve health by improving biomechanical and neural function by the manual correction of joint and soft tissue dysfunctions of the neuromusculoskeletal system differentiates it from mainstream medicine and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) disciplines, but has been a part of [[osteopathy]] and many eastern medicine interventions.<ref name=Phillips-PPC/> All chiropractic paradigms emphasize the spine as their focus, but their rationales for treatment vary depending on their particular belief system.  

The philosophy of chiropractic also stresses the importance of [[Prevention (medical)|prevention]] and primarily utilizes  a pro-active approach and a [[wellness]] model to achieve this goal.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=10–9 |title= Maintenance care: health promotion services administered to US chiropractic patients aged 65 and older, part II |author= Rupert RL, Manello D, Sandefur R |doi=10.1016/S0161-4754(00)90108-8 |pmid=10658871}}</ref> For some, prevention includes a concept of "maintenance care" which attempts to "detect and correct" structural imbalances of the neuromusculoskeletal system while in its primary, or [[functional]] state.<ref>{{cite web |author= Canadian Chiropractic Association |title= Glenerin guidelines: preventive maintenance care |url=http://www.ccachiro.org/client/cca/cca.nsf/web/Chapter+14+-+Preventative-Maintenance+Care!OpenDocument |date=1996 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> The objective is early identification of mechanical dysfunctions to prevent subsequent deterioration which would result in permanent pathological changes.<ref>{{cite book |author= Strang VV |title= Essential Principles of Chiropractic |location= Davenport, IA |publisher= Palmer College of Chiropractic |oclc=12102972 |date=1984 |pages= p. 26}}</ref>

The medicinal use of [[spinal manipulation]] can be traced back over 3000 years to ancient Chinese writings. [[Hippocrates]], the "father of medicine" used manipulative techniques,<ref name=Swedlo>Dean C. Swedlo, "[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2002.pdf The Historical Development of Chiropractic.]" pp. 55-58, ''The Proceedings of the 11th Annual History of Medicine Days'', Faculty of Medicine, The University of Calgary</ref> as did the ancient Egyptians and many other cultures. A modern reemphasis on [[manipulative therapy]] occurred in the late 1800s in North America with the emergence of the [[osteopathy]], founded by [[Andrew Still]] in 1874  and chiropractic, founded by [[Daniel David Palmer]] in 1895 in [[Davenport, Iowa]].<ref name=NCCAM>{{cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/chiropractic/ |title= An introduction to chiropractic |author= [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] |date=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> Spinal manipulative therapy gained recognition by mainstream medicine during the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.muaphysicians.com/historical.html]</ref> 

Today manipulative therapy is employed by medical specialists (e.g., physiatrists, orthopedists, sports medicine practitioners), and some osteopathic physicians, physical therapists and athletic trainers.<ref> [http://www.ncahf.org/pp/chirop.html#reformers]</ref> In the U.S., chiropractors perform over 90% of all manipulative treatments<ref>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/chiropractic/chiropractic05.pdf]</ref> and consider themselves to be expertly qualified providers of spinal adjustment, manipulation and other manual treatments.<ref name="wfc-identity">{{cite web |title= WFC consultation on the identity of the chiropractic profession |author= World Federation of Chiropractic |date=2005 |url=http://www.wfc.org/website/wfc/Website.nsf/WebPage/IdentityConsultation?OpenDocument&ppos=2&spos=5&rsn=y |accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref>

[[Manipulation under anesthesia]] or MUA is a specialized procedure that requires direct medical supervision and typically occurs in hospitals. MDs administer general anaesthesia and DCs administer spinal manipulation. Typically, it is performed on patients who have failed to respond to other forms of treatment.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Common themes to chiropractic care include holistic, conservative and non-medication approaches via [[manual therapy]].  Nevertheless, there are significant differences amongst the practice styles, claims and beliefs between various chiropractors.<ref name="Healey">James W. Healey, DC (1990) [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/08/21/13.html It's Where You Put the Period.] ''Dynamic Chiropractic'', October 10, 1990, Volume 08, Issue 21</ref> Those differences are reflected in the varied viewpoints of multiple national practice associations.<ref>[http://www.f-a-c-e.com/positionpaper1.htm]</ref>

''Straight'' chiropractors are the oldest movement. They adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D. D. and [[B. J. Palmer]], retain [[metaphysical]] definitions and [[vitalistic]] qualities. Straight chiropractors suggest that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an [[Innate intelligence]] within the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for almost any disease. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for treatment.  Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies. Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, etc.). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care. ''Objective Straight'' chiropractors, a recent offshoot, is differentiated from traditional straights mainly by the claims made. While traditional straights claimed that chiropractic adjustments are a plausible treatment for a wide range of diseases, objective straights only focus on the correction of chiropractic vertebral subluxations.{{fact}} 

''Mixer'' chiropractors are an early offshoot of the straight movement. This branch "mixes" diagnostic and treatment approaches from naturopathic, osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixer chiropractors incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ a myriad of treatments including joint and soft tissue manipulation, electromodalities, [[physical therapy]], exercise-rehabilitation and other complementary and alternative approaches such as acupuncture.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg>{{cite journal |journal= Arch Intern Med |date=1998 |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |title= Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |author= Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215}}</ref> They tend to focus more on the neuromusculoskeletal system but also treat non-neuromusculoskeletal conditions as well. Mixers tend to use more mainstream scientific methods and descriptions as opposed to metaphysical ones, but a minority of practitioners still employ questionable techniques and devices regarded as dubious by the scientific and medical communities.  Reform chiropractors are a recent [[evidence-based]] off-shoot of mixers who use scientifically-oriented methods and protocols and primarily regard themselves as neuromusculoskeletal specialists. Reform minded chiropractors have rejected traditional chiropractic theory, practice a manual medicine<ref>[http://www.emmks.ee/index.php?id=4]</ref> and favour limited prescription rights yet retain holistic and naturopathic elements.  Reform chiropractors support the scientific validity and cost-effectiveness of vaccination. In contrast to straight chiropractors, mixers and reformers generally want to be integrated into mainstream health care via [[Alternative medicine#Integrative medicine|integrative medicine]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}} 

''
There have been some calls to differentiate reform or 'contemporary' chiropractors from both straight and mixer chiropractors by establishing a Doctor of Chiropractic Medicine (D.C.M.) degree.  It is argued this would distinguish them from previous diplomas, and would allow current DCs to upgrade their education to the DCM degree which would permit DCMs to utilize prescription drugs suitable to the limitations of their practices and have a unified scope of practice across all jurisdictions.<ref>[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/chirop.html#reformers]</ref> <ref>{{cite news

It is generally not within the scope of practice of chiropractors to write [[medical prescription]]s. A notable exception is the state of Oregon, which allows chiropractors with minor additional qualification to prescribe over-the-counter drugs.<ref>http://gov.oregon.gov/OBCE/pdfs/CE_conteducation.pdf</ref>   Traditionally, chiropractors have opposed prescription drugs, but recently a majority of North American chiropractors have supported limited prescription rights.<ref name="mcdonald">McDonald W (2003) ''How Chiropractors Think and Practice: The Survey of North American Chiropractors.''

== History ==

{{main|Vertebral subluxation}}{{main|Chiropractic history}}

[[Image:ddpalmer3.jpg|thumb|left|275px|D.D. Palmer]]

D.D. Palmer gave the first spinal adjustment to a deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard, on September 18, 1895, reportedly resulting in a restoration of the man's hearing.<ref name="textbook">Palmer D.D., The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic. Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company, 1910.</ref>  Palmer had discovered that manual manipulation of the spine could result in improved neurological function. Friend and Rev. Samuel Weed suggested combining the words ''cheiros'' and ''praktikos'' (meaning "done by hand") and chiropractic was born.  Palmer claimed that vertebral joint misalignments, which he  termed "Subluxations" interfered with the body's function and its inborn ability to heal itself.<ref name=History-PPC>{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession |pages=23–64 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref>  This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer.

D.D. Palmer, using a [[vitalism|vitalistic]] approach, imbued the term [[vertebral subluxation|subluxation]] with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning. He held that a malposition of spinal [[bone]]s, which protect the spinal cord and nerve roots, interfered with the transmission of nerve impulses. Because half of the nervous system is sensory and the other half motor (control), he postulated that living things had an [[Innate intelligence]], a kind of "spiritual energy" or [[life force]] that received the sensory information from the various parts of the body and made a decision as to what the motor nerves should convey. D.D. Palmer claimed that subluxations interfered with this innate intelligence, and that by fixing them, all diseases could be treated.<ref name="textbook">Palmer D.D., The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic. Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company, 1910.</ref> 

Early on, the Palmers described this concept as similar to applying pressure to a water hose that supplies a garden:  relieve the pressure and the garden flourishes.  It was later theorized that a vertebral subluxation was a misaligned vertebra that pinched a nerve. They thought that this interfered with the information the nerve was transmitting between the central nervous system and the structures of the body. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<ref name ="Forgotten Theories">Keating J (1995), D.D. Palmer's Forgotten Theories of Chiropractic, [http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf A Presentation to the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]</ref> 

In 1996, the vertebral subluxation was defined as "''a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological [[articular]] changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health''", though this definition has come under critique both internally and externally for its ambiguity.<ref name=ACA_paradigm>Association of Chiropractic Colleges, [http://www.chirocolleges.org/paradigm_scopet.html Chiropractic Paradigm]</ref> More recently, in 2005, the [[World Health Organization]] defined the vertebral subluxation as "''A lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity''."<ref name=WHO-guidelines>{{cite paper |author= World Health Organization |date=2005 |title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref>

Nevertheless, the debate about the need to remove the concept of subluxation from the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing since the mid 1960s. While straights hold firmly to the term and its vitalistic construct, reformers suggest that the mechanistic model will allow chiropractic to better integrate into mainstream medicine without making claims inherent in the term. Anthony Rosner PhD, director of education and research at the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER) considered subluxation and the concept of [[Occam's razor]]. He suggests 

:"there is no obvious reason to discard the concept of subluxation, while at the same time maintaining that it is not a rigid entity, but rather an important model and concept; a work in progress that undoubtedly will undergo extensive modification as our concepts of light or psychoanalysis have evolved over half a century."<ref name="Anthony Rosner">Rosner A (2006) [http://www.chiroweb.com/columnist/rosner/ Occam's razor and subluxation: a close shave], ''Dynamic Chiropractic'' Aug 2006</ref>

In general, critics of chiropractic subluxation are skeptical on its clinical value and philosophical merits.  This is still a continuing source of contention within the chiropractic profession as well, with certain chiropractic schools still teaching the straight/traditional metaphysical model of subluxation while others have moved towards a scientific and [[evidence-based]] model.<ref>Undergraduate and
Graduate Programs, Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College[http://www.cmcc.ca/PDF/2006/CMCC_Calendar06to07.pdf PDF online]</ref>

=== Medical opposition ===

In [[1899]], a medical doctor in Davenport, USA, named Heinrich Matthey started a campaign against drugless practitioners. D.D. Palmer insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medical doctors, as his graduates did not prescribe drugs, perform surgery or evaluate laboratory diagnostics. However, in 1906, D.D. Palmer was convicted for practicing [[medicine]] without a license.  In response, B.J. created the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA) for the purpose of protecting its members by covering their legal expenses should they get arrested for practicing medicine.<ref>Keating J. (1999), [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/17/25/09.html Tom Moore Defender of Chiropractic Part 1], ''Dynamic Chiropractic''</ref> 
[[Image:BJPalmer2.jpg|thumb|left|130px|BJ Palmer, Developer of Chiropractic, 1882-1961]]

Its first case came in 1907, when Shegataro Morikubo, DC was charged with unlicensed practice of [[osteopathic medicine]] in Wisconsin. Morikubo was freed using the defense that chiropractic [[philosophy]] was different from osteopathic philosophy.  The victory reshaped the development of the chiropractic profession, which then marketed itself as a science, an art and a philosophy.  This began a longstanding feud between chiropractors and medical doctors that would culminate in the mid 1980's in a landmark case, Wilk et al. vs [[American Medical Association]] (AMA). Until 1983, the AMA held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with an "unscientific practitioner", and labeled chiropractic "an unscientific [[cult]]".{{citequote}}  In 1984, Joseph Janse, DC, ND, attempted to describe the divide in chiropractic and medical philosophy regarding prevention and patient care: 

<blockquote>
"Unless pathology is demonstrable under the microscope, as in the laboratory or by roentgenograms, to them [allopaths] it does not exist. For years the progressive minds in chiropractic have pointed out this deficiency. With emphasis they [chiropractors] have maintained the fact that prevention is so much more effective than attempts at a cure. They pioneered the all-important principle that effective eradication of disease is accomplished only when it is in its functional (beginning) phase rather than its organic (terminal) stage. It has been their contention that in general the doctor, the therapist and the clinician have failed to realize exactly what is meant by disease processes, and have been satisfied to consider damaged organs as disease, and to think in terms of sick organs and not in terms of sick people. In other words, we have failed to contrast disease with health, and to trace the gradual deteriorization along the downward path, believing almost that mild departures from the physiological normal were of little consequence, until they were replaced by pathological changes…"<ref>{{cite book |author= Strang VV |title= Essential Principles of Chiropractic |location= Davenport, IA |publisher= Palmer College of Chiropractic |oclc=12102972 |date=1984 |pages= p. 26}}</ref>
</blockquote>

===Wilk et al. vs. American Medical Association===
Chester A. Wilk, DC from Chicago initiated an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] suit against the AMA and other medical associations in 1976 - [[Wilk v. American Medical Association|Wilk ''et al.'' vs AMA ''et al.'']].<ref name="Sore Throat">Robbins J (1996),Medical monopoly: the game nobody wins - excerpt from 'Reclaiming Our Health: Exploding the Medical Myth and Embracing the Source of True Healing', ''Vegetarian Times'' [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n230/ai_18696325/pg_3 available online]</ref> The landmark lawsuit ended in 1987 when the [[US District Court]] found the AMA guilty of conspiracy and restraint of trade; the Joint Council on Accreditation of Hospitals and the [[American College of Physicians]] were exonerated. The court recognized that the AMA had to show its concern for patients, but was not persuaded that this could not have been achieved in a manner less restrictive of competition, for instance by public education campaigns. The AMA lost its appeal to the Supreme Court, and could no longer prevent medical physicians from collaborating with chiropractors.<ref name = Wilk>[http://www.chiro.org/abstracts/amavschiro.pdf Wilk vs American Medical Association Summary]</ref> Judge Susan Getzendanner, who presided over the Wilk case, opined:
<blockquote>

'':"Evidence at the trial showed that the defendants took active steps, often covert, to undermine chiropractic educational institutions, conceal evidence of the usefulness of chiropractic care, undercut insurance programs for patients of chiropractors, subvert government inquiries into the efficacy of chiropractic, engage in a massive disinformation campaign to discredit and destabilize the chiropractic profession and engage in numerous other activities to maintain a medical physician monopoly over health care in this country".'' {{Fact|date=February 2008}}
</blockquote>

=== Movement toward science ===

In 1975, the [[National Institutes of Health]] brought chiropractors, osteopaths, medical doctors and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] scientists together in a conference on spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] to develop strategies to study the effects of spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]]. In 1978, the ''Journal of Manipulative & Physiological Therapeutics'' (JMPT) was launched, and in 1981 it was included in the National Library of Medicine's ''[[Index Medicus]]''.<ref name="Faulty Logic">Keating J [http://www.sherman.edu/research/rsch510/FaultyLogic-in-Chiro.pdf Faulty Logic & Non-skeptical Arguments in Chiropractic]</ref> Joseph Keating dates the birth of chiropractic as a science to a 1983 commentary in the JMPT entitled "Notes from the (chiropractic college) underground" in which Kenneth F. DeBoer, then an instructor in basic science at Palmer College in Iowa, revealed the power of a scholarly journal (JMPT) to empower faculty at the chiropractic schools. DeBoer's opinion piece demonstrated the faculty's authority to challenge the status quo, to publicly address relevant, albeit sensitive, issues related to research, training and skepticism at chiropractic colleges, and to produce "cultural change" within the chiropractic schools so as to increase research and professional standards. It was a rallying call for chiropractic scientists and scholars.<ref name="Faulty Logic"/>
<!-- **Move to a separate article? Summarize? Definitely need source referencing **
Under the direction of Dr.Rob Francis, Dean of Clinical Sciences at TCC, the full momentum swinging chiropractic into the orthodox health care delivery system was pioneered through Texas Chiropractic College (TCC) which led the way for chiropractic's entrance into mainstream medical acceptance of chiropractors practicing in the orthodox health care delivery system through the development of the first hospital rotation program for chiropractic students.
The first hospital rotation for chiropractic interns and the first certification course in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) for chiropractors was developed in the 1980’s, by Dr. Rob Francis while Dean of Clinical Sciences at Texas Chiropractic College. 
After developing and implementing a hospital based clinical rotation for chiropractic interns at the Texas Medical Center in orthopedic surgery, Dr. Francis embarked on a mission to incorporate chiropractic services in the hospital setting by pioneering medical staff privileges for chiropractors. After successfully gaining full medial staff privileges for chiropractors at local Houston hospitals, Dr. Francis began to organize the academic programs to certify doctors of chiropractic in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) and Hospital Protocol.
After Dr. Francis was certified and proctored clinically in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) by board certified orthopedic surgeons, he was granted clinical privileges to admit patients to the hospital operating room for this procedure. Soon thereafter he developed a board approved MUA certification course for chiropractors that included hospital protocol, operating room proficiency and clinical proctorship in MUA under the auspices of the TCC Division of Post Graduate Studies.
The course became quite popular with a large number of chiropractors around the country seeking parity with medical physicians in the orthodox health care delivery system during the early 1990’s. Soon other colleges followed the TCC MUA model and began offering through post graduate programs the TCC-developed MUA certification course.
The hospital rotation program for chiropractic interns was developed during the same time period and became another TCC model for other colleges interested in providing chiropractic interns with the opportunity to rotate through hospitals and share chiropractic clinical models with their medical colleagues.
Dr. Francis initially personally selected the interns to rotate through the orthopedic service at the Texas Medical Center but soon the request by the medical staff and faculty for more chiropractic interns to rotate through services other than orthopedics allowed the program to expand to include rotations in family practice, internal medicine, radiology, neurosurgery, physical medicine and rheumatology. 
Towards an effort to shepherd this rapid expansion in a meaningful fashion, Dr. Francis recruited other TCC faculty members to participate in the hospital rotation program for TCC interns. The faculty involved in the hospital based program monitored the activity and interaction between the interns, medical students, medical school faculty and attending physicians at the hospital subsequently leading to the to development of didactic presentations at Hospital Grand Rounds to the hospital staff, medical school physicians and faculty at the medical center hospitals.
Presentations on the Rationale for Spinal Manipulative Therapy, Skeletal Radiology, Diagnostic Imaging and other clinical presentations were made by the TCC faculty leading the way for further expansion of the program.
Dr. Francis currently holds appointment as Clinical Assistant Professor of Family Medicine in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and has participated in federally funded research programs at the medical school to develop curriculum model for teaching CAM therapies to medical students.
Dr. Francis continues to teach the MUA certification courses around the country and has expanded the course to Europe teaching MUA to European chiropractors in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France.
The intern hospital rotation program continues to bridge the chasm of communication that once existed between the medical community and the chiropractic profession. -->

Chiropractic researchers Robert Mootz and Reed Phillips suggest that, in chiropractic's early years, influences from both straight and mixer concepts were incorporated into its construct. They conclude that chiropractic has both [[materialism|materialistic]] qualities that lend themselves to scientific investigation and [[vitalism|vitalistic]] qualities that do not (Table 1). 

With relatively little federal funding, academic research in chiropractic has only recently become established in the USA. In 1994 and 1995, half of all grant funding to chiropractic researchers was from the US Health Resources and Services Administration (7 grants totaling $2.3 million). The Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (11 grants, $881,000) and the Consortium for Chiropractic Research (4 grants, $519,000) accounted for most of the rest. By 1997, there were 14 peer-reviewed chiropractic journals in English that encouraged the publication of chiropractic research, including ''The Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT)'', ''Topics in Clinical Chiropractic'', and the ''Journal of Chiropractic Humanities''. However, of these, only ''JMPT'' is included in ''[[Index Medicus]]''. Research into chiropractic, whether from Universities or chiropractic colleges, is however often published in many other scientific journals.<ref>Chirofind.com [http://www.chiroweb.com/find/research.html Chiropractic Research]</ref>

While there is still debate about the effectiveness of chiropractic for the many conditions in which it is applied, chiropractic seems to be most effective for acute low back pain and tension headaches.<ref name =Duke>McCrory DC, et al. (2001) ''Evidence Report: Behavioral and Physical Treatments for Tension-type and Cervicogenic Headache''. Duke University Evidence-Based Practice Center, Durham, North Carolina  [http://www.fcer.org/html/Research/DukeEvidenceReport.htm available online] ([[PDF]] format)</ref> One small pilot study has shown that upper cervical spinal manipulation may be beneficial for certain types of hypertension.<ref name=Bakris>Bakris, G "[http://www.nature.com/jhh/journal/v21/n5/abs/1002133a.html Atlas vertebra realignment and achievement of arterial pressure goal in hypertensive patients: a pilot study]" ''Journal of Human Hypertension'' (2007) 21, 347–352. doi:10.1038/sj.jhh.1002133; published online 2 March 2007 [http://www.ucrf.org/themes/nuccra/images_new/pdf/Hypertension2007.pdf Complete article]</ref>

When testing the efficacy of health treatments, [[double blind]] studies are considered acceptable scientific rigor. These are designed so that neither the patient nor the doctor knows whether they are using the actual treatment or a placebo (or "sham") treatment. However, chiropractic treatment involves a [[Spinal adjustment|manipulation]]; "sham" procedures cannot be easily devised for this, and even if the patient is unaware whether the treatment is a real or sham procedure, the doctor cannot be unaware. Thus there may be "observer bias" - the tendency to see what you expect to see, and the potential for the patient to wish to report benefits to "please" the doctor. Similarly, it is often difficult to devise a sham procedure for surgical procedures, but it is not impossible. It is also a problem in evaluating treatments; even when there are objective outcome measures, the [[placebo effect]] can be very substantial. Thus, DCs have historically relied mostly on their own clinical experience and the shared experience of their colleagues, as reported in [[case studies]], to direct their treatment methods. Consequently there has been a call to increase [[qualitative research]] studies which can better examine the whole chiropractic clinical encounter.

==== The Manga Report ====

The Manga Report was an outcomes-study funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and conducted by three health economists led by Professor Pran Manga. The Report supported the scientific validity, safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic for low-back pain, and found that chiropractic care had higher patient satisfaction levels than conventional alternatives. The report states that "The literature clearly and consistently shows that the major savings from chiropractic management come from fewer and lower costs of auxiliary services, fewer hospitalizations, and a highly significant reduction in chronic problems, as well as in levels and duration of disability."<ref name="manga">Manga P, Angus D.

==== Workers' Compensation studies ====

In 1998, a study of 10,652 Florida workers' compensation cases was conducted by Steve Wolk. He concluded that "a claimant with a back-related injury, when initially treated by a chiropractor versus a medical doctor, is less likely to become temporarily disabled, or if disabled, remains disabled for a shorter period of time; and claimants treated by medical doctors were hospitalized at a much higher rate than claimants treated by chiropractors."<ref>Wolk S. (1988) An analysis of Florida workers' compensation medical claims for back-related injuries. ''J Amer Chir Ass'' 27:50-59</ref> Similarly, a 1991 study of Oregon Workers' Compensation Claims examined 201 randomly selected workers' compensation cases that involved disabling low-back injuries: when individuals with similar injuries were compared, those who visited DCs generally missed fewer days of work than those who visited MDs.<ref>Nyiendo J. (1991) Disability low back Oregon workers' compensation claims. Part II: Time loss. ''J Manip Physiol Ther'' 14:231-239</ref>

A 1989 study analyzed data on Iowa state records from individuals who filed claims for back or neck injuries. The study compared benefits and the cost of care from MDs, DCs and DOs, focusing on individuals who had missed days of work and who had received compensation for their injuries. Individuals who visited DCs missed on average 2.3 fewer days than those who visited MDs, and 3.8 fewer days than those who saw DOs, and accordingly, less money was dispersed as employment compensation on average for individuals who visited DCs.<ref>Johnson M. (1989) A comparison of chiropractic, medical and osteopathic care for work-related sprains/strains. ''J Manip Physiol Ther'' 12:335-344</ref>

In 1989, a survey by Cherkin ''et al.'' concluded that patients receiving care from health maintenance organizations in the state of Washington were three times as likely to report satisfaction with care from DCs as they were with care from other physicians. The patients were also more likely to believe that their chiropractor was concerned about them.<ref>Cherkin CD, MacCornack FA, Berg AO (1988) [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1026519 Managing low back pain. A comparison of the beliefs and behaviours of family physicians and chiropractors.]''West J Med'' 149:475–480</ref>

==== American Medical Association (AMA) ====

In 1997, the following statement was adopted as policy of the AMA after a report on a number of alternative therapies.<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13638.html AMA (CSAPH) Report 12 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (A-97) Full Text<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Specifically about chiropractic care it said,"[[joint manipulation|Manipulation]] has been shown to have a reasonably good degree of efficacy in ameliorating back pain, headache, and similar musculoskeletal complaints."
In 1992, the AMA stated "It is ethical for a physician to associate professionally with chiropractors provided that the physician believes that such association is in the best interests of his or her patient. A physician may refer a patient for diagnostic or therapeutic services to a chiropractor permitted by law to furnish such services whenever the physician believes that this may benefit his or her patient. Physicians may also ethically teach in recognized schools of chiropractic. (V, VI)"<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/8332.html AMA (Professionalism) E-3.041 Chiropractic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==== British Medical Association ====

The British Medical Association notes that "There is also no problem with GPs [doctors] referring patients to practitioners in osteopathy and chiropractic who are registered with the relevant statutory regulatory bodies, as a similar means of redress is available to the patient."<ref name=BMA_referrals>British Medical Association, "[http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/refcomtherap0406?OpenDocument&Highlight=2,Chiropractic Referrals to complementary therapists]"</ref>

In February 2008, the World Health Organization sponsored Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders, the largest and most comprehensive study on neck pain to date. The task force was comprised of a group of international clinician-scientists and methodologists to undertake a best-evidence synthesis on neck pain and its associated disorder and make recommendations of clinical practice guidelines for the management of neck pain and its associated disorders. This included a consensus of the top experts in the world whose findings will be collated using best-evidence synthesis, which addresses risk and prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment risks and benefits.<ref>[http://www.nptf.ualberta.ca/]</ref> With respect to the association of VBA stroke and cervical manipulation the study concluded:

<blockquote>
#  Vertebrobasilar artery stroke is a rare event in the population.
#  There is an association between vertebrobasilar artery stroke and chiropractic visits in those under 45 years of age.
#There is also an association between vertebrobasilar artery stroke and use of primary care physician visits in all age groups.
#no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care.
# The increased risks of vertebrobasilar artery stroke associated with chiropractic and physician visits is likely explained by patients with vertebrobasilar dissection-related neck pain and headache consulting both chiropractors and primary care physicians before their VBA stroke."<ref>[http://www.fcer.org/html/News/bonejointdecade.htm</ref>  
</blockquote>

This follows on a 2007 study of 50 276 chiropractic manipulations of the cervical spine which turned up no reports of serious adverse effects.  The authors concluded that the risk of serious adverse effects was, at worst, 6 per 100,000 manipulations.   The most common minor side effect was ''fainting, dizziness, and/or light-headedness'', which occurred after, at worst, 16 in 1,000 treatments.<ref name="Thiel, H.W., et al">''Safety of chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine: a prospective national survey'', Spine. 2007 Oct 1;32(21):2375-8 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17906581 Abstract]</ref> 

Spinal manipulation is a regulated/controlled medical intervention and can only be performed by chiropractors and a limited number of physical medicine professionals. Prior to the adminstration of spinal maniopulative therapy, absolute [[contraindications]] must be screened out.  These include inflammatory arthritides, fractures, dislocations, instabilities, bone weakening disorders, tumours, infections, acute trauma as well as various circulatory and neurological disorders.<ref>[http://www.ccachiro.org/client/cca/cca.nsf/web/Chapter+13+-+Contraindications+And+Complications!OpenDocument]</ref> According to the World Health Organization "employed skilfully and appropriately, chiropractic care is safe and effective for the prevention and management of a number of health problems."<ref name=WHO-guidelines/>

==Vaccination==

Although [[vaccination]] is one of the most cost-effective forms of prevention against infectious disease, it remains [[Vaccine controversy|controversial]] within the chiropractic community. Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects.<ref name=Busse/> Evidence-based chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but a minority of the profession rejects it, as traditional chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that diseases cannot be affected by vaccines.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2000 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=e43 |title= Chiropractors and vaccination: a historical perspective |author= Campbell JB, Busse JW, Injeyan HS |pmid=10742364 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/4/e43}}</ref> The [[American Chiropractic Association]] and the International Chiropractic Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.<ref name=Campbell/> The Canadian Chiropractic Association supports vaccination; surveys in Canada in 2000 and 2002 found that 40% of chiropractors supported vaccination, and that over a quarter opposed it and advised patients against vaccinating themselves or their children.<ref name=Busse>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=2005 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=367–73 |title= Chiropractic antivaccination arguments |author= Busse JW, Morgan L, Campbell JB |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.04.011 |pmid=15965414}}</ref>
