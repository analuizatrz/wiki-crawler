The '''charismatic movement''' began with the adoption of certain beliefs typical of those held by [[Pentecostal]] Christians &mdash; specifically what are known as the biblical [[charism]]s or [[spiritual gift]]s: [[glossolalia]] (speaking in tongues), [[prophesying]], supernatural healing, etc. &mdash; by those within mainstream [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches. Many charismatic Christians went on to form separate churches and denominations.  The writings of [[John William Fletcher|John Fletcher]] were influential in beginning this movement, which was sparked by the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in California, which took place in 1906.  Though charismatic theology finds its roots in the [[Holiness Movement|Wesleyan-Holiness]] tradition, charismatics can now be found within numerous theological movements and in multiple denominations.    

'''Charismatic''' is an umbrella term used to describe those [[Christianity|Christians]] who believe that the manifestations of the [[Holy Spirit]] seen in the first century Christian Church, such as [[faith healing]], [[miracle]]s, [[prophecy]], and [[glossolalia]] (speaking in other tongues or languages), are available to contemporary Christians and ought to be experienced and practiced today. The word ''charismatic'' is derived from the Greek word ''χαριςμα'' ("gift," itself derived from χαρις, "grace" or "favor") which is the term used in the [[Bible]] to describe a wide range of supernatural experiences (especially in [[1 Corinthians]] 12-14).

Often confused with [[Pentecostalism]] (which inspired it), charismatic Christianity tends to differ in key aspects: most charismatics reject the preeminence given by Pentecostalism to [[glossolalia]], reject what they consider to be [[legalism (theology)|legalism]] sometimes associated with Pentecostalism, and often stay in their existing denominations such as [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal|Roman Catholic Charismatics]].

Because of the continual cross-over between Pentecostalism and the modern charismatic movement, it is increasingly difficult to speak of charismatics and Pentecostals as being part of separate movements. Yet because neither movement is [[monolithic]], it is inaccurate to speak of them as being one movement. The difference is primarily one of origins.  Beliefs of the two groups are very similar; each movement, however, is unique in its historical beginnings.  Having been conceived in unique contexts, the difference may secondarily be described in terms of contrasting church cultures evidenced through each movement's manners and customs (i.e., worship styles, preaching styles, altar ministry methods).  Until a more acceptable broad nomenclature is used, it needs to be understood that both movements share a great deal in common, and yet can sometimes be clearly differentiated.

==History==
===Early Charismatic History===
Many of the supernatural miracles and works are of Jesus and of the early [[Apostles]] are portrayed throughout the New Testament.  Even of [[Jesus]] it is said:

And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen. <ref>Joh 21:25</ref>

However, even after the early apostles, their close associates and succeeding generations continued the work of the Spirit-empowered Gospel, even long after the last book of the New Testament was written.  

[[Justin Martyr]] (A.D. 100-165), an early apologist, was born of pagan parents near Shechem, within modern-day Israel.  In his "Dialogue With Trypho", he says, "For the prophetic gifts remain with us even to the present time,"  and "Now it is possible to see among us women and men who possess gifts of the Spirit of God."<ref>(Justin Martyr, Dialogue With Trypho, vol. 1 of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library, ed. Rev. Alxander Roberts and james Donaldsen (Edinburgh, England:  T&T Clark, 1974), 240,243).</ref>  "For numberless demoniacs throughout the whole world, and in your city, many of our Christians men exorcising them in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, heave healed and do heal, rendering helpless and driving the possessing devils out of the men."<ref>(Justin Martyr, The Second Apology of Justin, vol. 1 of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library, 190.</ref>

[[Irenaeus]] (A.D.125-200) was the bishop (from the New Testament greek word episkopos - trans. episcopate, bishop, overseer) of Lyons, born in Smyrna, and discipled by the apostle John.  He states:  "For some do certainly and truly drive out devils, so that those who have been thus cleansed from evil spirits frequently both believe, and join themselves to the Church.  Others have foreknowledge of things to come:  they see visions and utter prophetic expressions.  Others still heal the sick by laying their hands upon them, and they are made whole.  Yea, moreover, as I have said, the dead even have been raised up, and remained among us for many years.  And what shall I more say?  It is not possible to name the number of gifts which the Church throughout the whole world has received from God in the name of Jesus Christ...In like manner we do also hear many brethren in the Church who possess prophetic gifts and who through the Spirit speak all kinds of languages, and bring to light for the general benefit the hidden things of men, and declare the mysteries of God."<ref>Irenaeus, Against Heresies, vol. 1 of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library, 409,531.</ref>

[[Tertullian]] (A.D.160-240), another Church father, was a born in Carthage and believed in Jesus in A.D.192.  He writes, "For seeing that we acknowledge the spiritual charismata, or gifts, we too have merited the attainment of the prophetic gift."  He speaks of a woman in the congregation, "whose lot it has been to be favored with sundry gifts of revelation," experiencing visitations from angels and the Lord Himself.  She knew the secrets of peoples' hearts and was able to give answer to some of their deepest needs, including physical healing.  Tertullian says,  "All her communications are examined with the most scrupulous care in order that their truth may be probed."<ref>Tertullian, A Treatise on the Soul, vol. 3 of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library, 188,189.</ref>  He also writes, "And heaven knows how many distinguished men, to say nothing of the common people, have been cured either of devils or of their sicknesses."<ref>Tertullian, Apologetic Works, vol. 10 of the Fathers of the Church, trans. William P. Le Saint (Longdon:  Longmans & Green, 1950), 121.</ref>  In writing to the heretic Marcion, he states, "Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have predicted things to come and have made manifest the secrets of the heart; let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer - only let it be by the spirit, in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture, whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him.  Now all these signs are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty."<ref>Tertullian, Against Marcion, vol. 3 of The Ante-Nicene Christian Library, 447.</ref>  He also practiced, like the earlier Apostles, the custom of the laying-on of hands:  
"the hand is laid on us, invoking and inviting the Holy Spirit through benediction."<ref>Tertullian, On Baptism, vol. 3 of The Ante-Nicene Christian Library, 672.</ref>

[[Origen]](A.D.185-284) writes, "Some give evidence of their having received through this faith a marvelous power by the cures which they perform, invoking no other name over thse who need their help than that of the God of all things, and of Jesus, along with a mention of His history.  For by these means we too have seen many persons freed from grievous calamities, and from distractions of mind, and madness, and countless other ills, which could not be cured neither by men nor devils."  He also comments that any diminuendo of signs and miracles are the result of a lack of holiness and purity among the Christians in his day.<ref>Origen, Against Celsus, vol. 4 of The Ante-Nicene Christian Library, 473, 614.</ref>

[[Novatian]] (A.D.210-280) was an elder (from the New Testament greek word presbyteros - trans. elder, prebyter) of the early church in Rome.  He was the predecessor to the Cathari movement and many modern-day Baptists cite him as one of the hallmarks of the Christian faith.  Novatian writes, "This is he [the Holy Spirit] who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, give power and healings, does wonderful works, offers discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus making the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed."<ref>Russell J. DeSimone, trans. "Novation:  The Trinity," The Fathers of the Church (Washington, DC:  Consortium, 1974), 4.</ref>

[[Cyprian]] (A.D.195-258), a bishop in Carthage, relates, "For beside the visions of the night, even in the daytime, the innocent age of boys [innocent children] is among us filled with the Holy Spirit, seeing in an ecstasy with their eyes, and hearing and speaking those things whereby the Lord condescends to warn and instruct us."<ref>Cyprian, The Epistles of Cyprian, vol.5 of The Ante-Nicene Christian Library, 290.</ref>

[[The Didache]], a brief early Christian treatise written somewhere between A.D.50-200, contains instructions for Christian communities, and also acknowledged the legitimacy of apostolic and prophetic ministries, giving instruction regarding recognizing false prophets.  [[The Shepherd of Hermes]], written after the time of the first 12 apostles,  depicts supernatural revelations and visions of the author.

[[Ignatius]] (A.D.35-107), as the Bishop of Antioch and student of the apostle John, wrote "To the Philadelphians" just after A.D.100.  In the letter he makes referance to a prophetic message he spoke to them when he last visited them.<ref>Michael W. Holmes, ed., The Apostolic Fathers, trans. J.B. Lightfoot and J.R. Harmer (Grand Rapids, MI:  Baker 1989), 108.</ref>

[[Montanus]], irregardless of the grim picture portrayed in history by his enemies, was nonetheless defended by Terullian and in later history by John Wesley.  He ministered during the Second Century.  He and his followers affirmed the gift of prophecy and speaking in tongues under the "possession" of the Holy Spirit.<ref>Tabbernee, William, 1997. Montanist Inscriptions and Testimonia: Epigraphic Sources Illustrating the History of Montanism (Macon [GA], Mercer University Press) (North American Patristic Society Patristic Monograph Series, 16).</ref> [[Wesley]] wrote concerning Montaus, "I was fully convinced of what I had once suspected:  1) That the Montanists, in the second and third centuries, were real Scriptural Christians; and 2) That the grand reason why the miraculous gifts were so soon withdrawn was not only that faith and holiness were well nigh lost, but that dry, formal orthodox men began even then to ridicule whatever gifts they had not themselves, and to decry them all as either madness or imposture."<ref>Nehemiah Curnack, ed., vol.3 of "The Journal of the Rev. John Wesley A.M.", 8 vols.  (London:  Epworth, 1938), 490.</ref>

[[Irenaeus]] (~A.D.100-200) was bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, which is now Lyon, France.  He was also a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of the Apostle John.  He laments those who "set aside at once both the Gospel and the prophetic Spirit,"  emphasizing that Paul, "expressly speaks of prophetical gifts, and recognizes men and women prophesying in the Church."<ref>Irenaeus, Against Heresies, vol.1 of The Ante-Nicene Christian Library, 429.</ref>

[[Saint Anthony]] (the Great) healed sick people and cast out demons.  "Through him the Lord healed the bodily ailments of many present, and cleansed others from evil spirits."<ref>Athanasius (A.D. 251-356), Life of Antony, vol. 4 of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, 200.</ref>

[[Pachomius]] (A.D. 292-346) was "a man endowed with apostolic grace both in teaching and in performing miracles."  Once, a he met a visitor from the West who spoke Latin, a language Pachomius didn't know.  After three hours of earnest prayer, Pachomius was able to speak with the man in Latin.<ref>Jerome and Gennadius, Illustrious Men of the Church, vol. 3 of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, 387.</ref>

[[Athanasius]] (A.D. 295-373) was bishop of Alexandria in Egypt.  Regarding the life and ministry of Saint Anthoy, Athanasius comments, "And we ought not to doubt whether such marvels were wrought by the hand of a man.  For it is the promise of the Saviour, when He saith, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, remove hence and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible unto you."<ref>Athanasius (A.D. 251-356), Life of Antony, vol. 4 of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, 200.</ref> He also comments, "We know bishops who work wonders [miracles]..."<ref>Athanasius, Letters of Athanasius, vol. 4 of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, 560.</ref>

[[Hilarion]] (A.D. 305-385) was born in the City of Gaza.  Jerome, who knew him personally, relates, "Time would fail me if I wished to relate all the miracles which were wrought by him."  Hilarion once encountered a paralyzed man: "...weeping much and stretching out his hand to the prostrate man he said, "I bid you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, arise and walk."  The words were still on the lips of the speaker when, with miraculous speed, the limbs were strengthened and the man arose and stood firm."<ref>Jerome, The Life of Saint Hilarion, vol. 6 of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, 309, 314.</ref>

[[Ambrose]] (A.D. 240-397) was the bishop of Milan in A.D. 374.  He once received the knowledge of the location of the tombs of a couple martyrs.  At this location, a blind man miraculously received his sight.<ref>Augustine, The City of God, vol. 2 of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, 485.</ref>  Ambrose himself states, "You see the Father and Christ also set teachers in the churches; and as the Father gives the gift of healings, so too does the Son give; as the Father gives the gift of tongues, so too has the Son also granted it.  In like manner we have heard also above concerning the Holy Spirit that He too grants the same kinds of graces."<ref>Ambrose, Of the Spirit, vol. 10 of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, 134.</ref>

[[Jerome]] (A.D. 347-420) was a Christian in Rome, who had a visitation of Christ himself, who instructed Him to turn away from learning worldly philosophy.  He recorded the miracles of other Christians, including one of Hilarion, who stilled a raging sea embroiled by a voilent earthquake. 

"Verily, what was said to the Apostles, "If ye have faith, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove into the sea, and it shall be done," may even be literally fulfilled if one has such faith as the Lord commanded the Apostles to have."<ref>Jerome, The Life of Saint Hilarion, 313.</ref>

[[Augustine]] (A.D. 354-43) became the bishop of Hippo in North Africa.  His later works affirm the realities of miraculous events in his lifetime, "For even now, miracles are wrought in the name of Christ, whether by His sacraments or by prayer or the relics of His saints." "I am so pressed by the promise of finishing this work that I cannot record all the miracles I know."<ref>Augustine, The City of God, "Concerning Miracles Which Were Wrought in Order That the World Might Believe in Christ and Which Cease Not to Be Wrough Now that the World Does Believe," 485, 489.</ref>

We should not discount the probability of such events as these, for the bones of Elisha (a holy man of God who was just like we are) produced miraculous events:
And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. <ref>2Ki 13:21</ref>

[[Benedict of Nursia]] (A.D.480-547) was known for his power in prayer and in facilitating miracles.  He recounts how a wall under construction once fell on a man, but through an hour of prayer, the young man revived and returned to his work on the wall.  Maurus, a student of Benedict, once ran on top of the water to save a young boy from drowning in a river.<ref>Saint Gregory the Great, Dialogues, vol.39 of the Fathers of the Church, trans. Odo John Zimmerman (New York:  Fathers of the Church, 1959), 69, 76-77.</ref>

[[The Cathari]] (also called [[Novations]] and [[Albigensians]]), whose named means "pure-ones", thrived between the 11th and 13th centuries.  They practiced what they called the consolamentum, which was the impartation of the work of the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands.  They sought the supernatural ministry of the Holy Spirit, including speaking in tongues.<ref>Neander, General History of the Christian Church, vol.3, 590.</ref>

[[The Waldenses]] began (around A.D. 1177) with a man named Peter Waldo, a wealthy merchant of Lyons, Southern France.  They were a renewal movement, and precurssors to the Reformation.  Note their confession in 1431:  "Therefore conerning the anointing of the sick, we hold it as an article of faith, and profess sincerely from the heart that sick persons, when they ask it, may lawfully be anointed with anointing oil by one who joins them in praying that it may be efficacious to the healing of the body according to the design and end and effect mentioned by the apostles; and we profess that such an anointing performed according to the apostolic design and practice will be healing and profitable."<ref>Gordon, The Ministry of Healing, 65.</ref>

[[Martin Luther]] (A.D. 1483-1586) is considered to be one of the key figures in the Protestant Reformation.  He stated in a conversation with Cochelus, "Est mihi revelatum, (I have had revelations)."  He also said, "I have learned under ths Spirit's guidance," and that he relied on the revelation of God - through the Word, but via the Spirit in a personal manner.<ref>Martin Luther, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church, vol.36 of Luther's Works, ed. Helmut T. Lehman and Jaroslav Pelikan (Philadelphia, PA: Muhlenberg, 1958), 77.</ref><ref>John S. Oyer, Lutheran Reformers Against the Anabaptist (The Hague, Netherlands:  Martinus Nijhoff, 1964), 231.</ref>  "Often has it happened, and still does, that devils have been driven out in the name of Christ; also by calling on His name and prayer, the sick have been healed."<ref>Gordon, The Ministry of Healing, 92.</ref>

Despite Luther's conflict with the [[Anabaptists]], he was in agreement with the Anabaptists on many issues, yet even he said of them, that they maintain an undue reliance upon the direct presence of the Holy Spirit, a testimony of the Anabaptists' direct experience with the Holy Spirit.<ref>John S. Oyer, Lutheran Reformers Against Anabaptists (The Hague:  M. Nijhoff, 1964), 234.</ref>

In Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich [[Zwingli]] (A.D. 1484-1531), Felix Manz and Conrad Grebel spearheaded the radical reformation of the [[Anabaptists]].  They rebelled against the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and began rebaptizing adults who had followed Jesus, but had unlawfully been 'baptized' as infants.  They are predecessors of the modern-day [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]], [[Puritans]], [[Quakers]], and [[Baptists]].  It was not unusual for them to dance, fall under the power of the Holy Spirit and speak in tongues.<ref>Franklin H. Little, The Origins of Sectarian Protestantism (New York:  Beacons, 1964), 19.</ref>  Felix Manz had special revelations where, once or twice in prison and elsewhere certain epistles of Paul were revealed to him as if he had them before his eyes.<ref>Horsch, "The Faith of the Swiss Brethren II," 15.  See also Geroge H. Williams, The Radical Reformation (Philadelphia, PA:  Westminster, 1962), 145.</ref>  Martin Bucer, a Zwinglian-type reformer, affirmed prophecy through the aid of the Holy Spirit and the subjective, inner call of the Holy Spirit to ministry.<ref>W. Peter Stephens, The Holy Spirit in the Theology of Martin Bucer (London:  Cambridge University Press, 1970), 178,179,190.</ref>  

The [[Anabaptists]] were more extreme than Luther and Bucer.  They insisted upon the "free course" of the Holy Spirit in worship, yet still maintained it all must be judged according to the Scriptures.<ref>John S. Oyer, Lutheran Reformers Against Anabaptists (The Hague:  M. Nijhoff, 1964), 86.</ref>  One Swiss Anabaptist document (A.D. 1532-1534) is titled "Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana)Baptists - Why They Do Not Attend the Churches".  The reason for not attending the state churches is these institutions forbid the congregation to exercise spritual gifts according to "the Christian order as taught in the gospel or the Word of God in 1 Corinthians 14."  "When such believers come together, "Everyone of you (note every one) hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation," etc...When someone comes to church and constantly hears only one person speaking, and all the listeners are silent, neither speaking nor prophesying, who can or will regard or confess the same to be a spiritual congregation, or confess according to 1 Corinthians 14 that God is dwelling and operating in them through His Holy Spirit with His gifts, impelling them one after another in the abovementioned order of speaking and prophesying."<ref>Paul Peachey and Shem Peachey, trans., "Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana)Baptists - Why They Do Not Attend the Churches,"  Mennonite Quarterly Review 45, no. 1 (1971):  10, 11.</ref>

[[Pilgram Marpeck]] was an Anabaptist leader in central Germany.  He rebukes those who exclude the existance of divine miracles and signs.  He says, "Nor does Scripture assert this exclusion...God has a free hand even in these last days."  He speaks of those who had been raised from the dead:  "Many of them have remained constant, enduring tortures inflicted by sword, rope, fire and water and suffering terrible, tyrannical, unheard-of deaths and martyrdoms, all of which they could easily have avoided by recantation.  Moreover one also marvels when he sees how the faithful God (who, after all, overflows with goodness) raises from the dead several such brothers and sisters of Christ after they were hanged, drowned, or killed in other ways.  Even today, they are found alive and we can hear their own testimony...Cannot everyone who sees, even the blind, say with a good conscience that such things are a powerful, unusual, and miraculous act of God?  Those who would deny it must be hardened men."<ref>William Klassen and Walter Klassen, ed. and trans., The Writings of Pilgram Marpeck (Scottdale, PA:  Herald, 1978), 50.</ref>  In Germany some Anabaptists, "excited by mass hysteria, experienced healings, glossolalia, contortions and other manifestations of a camp-meeting revival".<ref>George Williams, The Radical Reformation (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1962), 443.</ref>

[[Menno Simons]] (A.D. 1496-1561) was a Catholic priest who joined the Anabaptist around 1535, and began the Mennonite movement.  Regarding speaking in tongues, he says,  "Although Peter was previously informed by a heavenly vision that he might go to the Gentiles and teach them the gospel, still he refused to baptize the pious, noble and Godly centurion and his associates so long as he did not see the Holy Spirit was descended upon them, so that they spoke with tongues and glorified God...Peter commanded that those only should be baptized who had received the Holy Ghost, who spoke with tongues and glorified God."

Jacob [[Hutter]] (A.D. ?-1536, founder of the Hutterite movement) claimed authority from miracles in his life. The [[Hutterite]] Chronicle contains several accounts of miraculous events. Among other Anabaptist examples of charismatic expression were the "prophetic processions" (at Zurich in 1525, at Munster in 1534 and at Amsterdam in 1535).<ref>Walter Klaassen, Anabaptism: Neither Catholic Nor Protestant (Waterloo, Ontario: Conrad Press, 1973), 63.</ref>

One man named Martin whom authorities led across a bridge to execution in 1531 prophesied, "this once yet the pious are led over this bridge, but no more hereafter."  Just "a short time afterwards such a violent storm and flood came that the bridge was demolished".<ref>Martyrs' Mirror (Scottdale: Herald Press, 1950), 440.</ref>


[[John Bunyan]] (1628-1688), considered to be a landmark in Baptist history, received the entire book of "The Pilgrim's Progress", while "under the similitude of a dream".

The [[Hugenots]] (16th-18th Centuries) are considered to be Anabaptists by some and exhibited the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit.  Thus they were called, "The French Prophets."  They affirmed,  "God has no where in the Scriptures concluded Himself from dispensing again the extraordinary gifts of His Spirit unto men."<ref>Michael P. Hamilton, The Charismatic Movement (Grand Rapids, MI:  Eerdmans, 1975), 75.</ref>  Even 3 year old children prophesied and preached in French, even though they had never spoken the language previously.  One time, a 14 month old child exhorted them "to the Works of Repentance" in a loud voice.<ref>John Lacy, A Cry From the Desert (London:  n.p., 1708), 15.</ref>  They "fell on their backs, they shut their eyes, they heaved with the breast, they remained a while in trances, and coming out of them with twitching, they uttered all that came into their mouths."<ref>Hamilton, 75.</ref>  John Venett, one of them, also was amazed that his mother could speak French, "because she never before attempted to speak a word in that language, nor has since to my knowledge , and I am certain she could not do it."<ref>Lacy, 14.</ref>  Sir Richard Bulkey, a wealthy English nobleman, tells how he heard John Lacy, one of their leaders, "repeat long sentences in Latin, and another refugee speak in Hebrew, neither one of whom could speak a single word in these languages when not in spiritual ecstasy."<ref>Cutten, Speaking With Tongues:  Historically and Psychologically Considered, 55.</ref>   John Wesley defended the contemporary supernatural ministry of the Holy Spirit to one doubter by referencing the example of the French Prophets, "Sir, your memory fails you again...It has been heard of more than once, no further off than the days of Dauphin."<ref>John Wesley, vol. 10 of The Works of John Wesley, 14 vols.  (Grand Rapids, MI:  Zondervan, n.d.), 56.</ref>


===Modern Charismatic Movement 1950-1975===
While it is difficult to locate the place and time charismatic Christianity began to influence the mainstream churches, [[Dennis Bennett]], an American Episcopalian, is often cited as the movement's seminal influence. Bennett was the Rector at St Mark's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Church in [[Van Nuys]], California when he announced to the congregation in 1960 that he had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Soon after this he was ministering in [[Vancouver]] where he ran many workshops and seminars about the work of the Holy Spirit.[http://www3.telus.net/st_simons/arm12.htm] This influenced tens of thousands of Anglicans world-wide and also began a renewal movement within the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.

In the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] there was a renewed interest in the supernatural "gifts of the Spirit" in mainstream churches such as the Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, Anglican, and Catholic churches. The [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] was focused in individuals like [[Kevin Ranaghan]] and others at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]]. [[Dennis Bennett]] was Ranaghan's counterpart in the Episcopal Church. Meanwhile, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Colin Urquhart]], [[Michael Harper]], [[David Watson]] and others were in the vanguard of similar developments. The Roman Catholic Duquesne University in Pittsburgh began hosting charismatic revivals in 1977, which coincided with Jimmy Carter's election and the "born from above" or "born again" explosion.

In both the UK and [[New Zealand]] there was significant overlap between ex-[[Brethren]] charismatics and those of mainstream churches. Brethren men such as [[Campbell McAlpine]] and [[Arthur Wallis]] visited [[New Zealand]] for the renowned [[Massey University|Massey]] conference in [[1964]].  This was attended by several Anglicans including, the Rev. Ray Muller who went on to invite [[Dennis Bennett]] to New Zealand in [[1966]], and played a leading role in developing and promoting the ''Life in the Spirit'' seminars. Other leaders in the New Zealand movement included Baptist Wyn Fountain and Auckland Anglican Ken Prebble.<ref>Lineham, Peter (1982), Tongues Must Cease.</ref><ref>Knowles, Brett (1999), New Life: The New Life Churches of New Zealand: 1942-1979</ref>

The charismatic renewal movement in the Eastern Orthodox Church never exerted the influence that it did in other mainstream churches. Individual priests, such as Fr. [[Eusebius Stephanou]] of the Greek Orthodox Orthodox Archdiocese of North America, founder of the Brotherhood of St. Symeon the New Theologian, Fr. [[Athanasius Emmert]] of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese and Fr. [[Boris Zabrodsky]] of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] in America, founder of the Service Committee for Orthodox Spiritual Renewal (SCOSR) which published "[[Theosis]]" Newsletter, were some of the more prominent leaders of the charismatic renewal in Orthodoxy.

On an international level, [[David du Plessis]] along with a host of others (including [[Lutheran]] and even [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] ministers) promoted the movement. The latter did not last long with their denominations, either volunteering to leave or being asked to do so. But in the Episcopal and Catholic churches priests were permitted to continue on in their parishes, provided they did not allow these concerns to create major divisions within their congregations.

===Change 1975-2000===
While there are many charismatics within established denominations, many have left or have been forced out and have joined either more progressive Pentecostal churches or formed their own churches or denominations. The [[house church]] movement in the UK and the [[Vineyard movement]] in the USA are examples of a formal charismatic structure. The [[Hillsong Church]] in Australia is an example of a Pentecostal church that has embraced charismatic belief and practices, which has, in turn, influenced the Australian [[Assemblies of God]] denomination. In New Zealand, the pre-eminent Pentecostal movement has been the [[New Life Churches]], although other local and international Pentecostal denominations are also well established.

Since the mid 1980s, the charismatic movement has made some notable changes in its theology and emphases. This process has been termed ''[[Third Wave of the Holy Spirit|The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit]]'' and has been typified by the ministry of [[C. Peter Wagner]], [[Word of faith|Word-faith Theology]] and the [[Toronto blessing]] phenomenon.

==Charismatics: a world perspective==
As noted earlier, Pentecostal and charismatic are often used interchangeably.  With that in mind, according to ''Christianity Today'', Pentecostalism is "a vibrant faith among the poor; it reaches into the daily lives of believers, offering not only hope but a new way of living." [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html].  In addition, according to a 1999 U.N. report, "Pentecostal churches have been the most successful at recruiting its members from the poorest of the poor."  [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html] Also, according to Christianity Today, in Brazilian churches, where Pentecostal Christians are often very poor, "Preachers constantly ask parishioners to give what seem like laughable sums of money; these people tithe 20, 30, and sometimes as much as 50 percent of their income." [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html]  Christianity Today also noted that 
Brazilian Pentecostals talk of Jesus as someone real and close to them and doing things for them including providing food and shelter. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html]  In addition, according to Christianity Today, "Scholars have long branded Pentecostalism an eminently 'otherworldly' religion, focused more on things above than the mundane below. To many that seems like a foregone conclusion, given the movement's emphasis on charismatic experiences, intense religiosity, and ascetic tendencies. Even highly respected Pentecostal scholars argue this point." [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/013/36.107.html]

==Charismatic movement and Pentecostalism==

The charismatic movement shares many similarities with [[Pentecostalism]], and the stages of the latter seem to have been a prerequisite for the further developing of the said topic. The influence of Pentecostalism upon the charismatic movement cannot be denied. Both acknowledge the power of the [[Holy Spirit]]. [[Faith healing]] has major acceptance among adherents of both faiths, and both are known for their fiery services. Even still, many differences will allow a person to discern a charismatic from a Pentecostal, though some consider themselves both.

Pentecostals developed their own denomination, but charismatics tend to remain in their respective established churches or religious bodies. Charismatics have been susceptible to criticism that exceeds that of Pentecostalism, but criticism of both is widespread in comparison to other religious movements.

== Catholicism ==
:''Main article: [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]]''

Charismatic Christians are not exclusive to any single denomination, and indeed, charismatic theology is not even uniquely [[Protestant]]. There is a burgeoning charismatic movement within the [[Catholic Church]], and [[Pope John Paul II]] was reputed to have had a charismatic priest as his personal pastor.

In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, the movement became particularly popular in the Filipino and Hispanic communities of the United States, and in the Philippines itself. Traveling priests and lay people associated with the movement often visit parishes and sing what are known as charismatic masses. It is thought to be the second largest distinct sub-movement within Roman Catholicism, along with [[Traditional Catholicism]]. It presents a difficult situation for many Church authorities, who, as always, must be careful to admit innovation only where it is clear the innovation is consistent with the [[Bible]] and the teachings of the Church.

== Criticism of the movement ==
With the rise in popularity and influence of the charismatic movement, a number of criticisms have arisen from Christians who are outside the movement. [[Cessationism|Cessationists]] (popular amongst [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Fundamentalists]] and [[Southern Baptists]]) believe that the spiritual gifts that charismatics experience are no longer available to the church, and argue that these experiences are demonic and/or psychological in nature.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} The Southern Baptist Organization in a recent controversial move actually voted to forbid the practice of glossolalia among their members.<ref>The SBC published the a contoversial paper after a November 2005 meeting to address the issue of glossalalia within their ranks, with a particular focus on new mission candidates. [http://www.sbc.net/redirect.asp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eimb%2Eorg%2Fcore%2Fstory%2Easp%3FstoryID%3D3834%26LanguageID%3D1709&key=glossolalia&title=Policy+on+tongues+and+prayer+language+%2D+International+Mission+Board%2C+SBC&ndx=SBC%2C+IMB%2C+NAMB%2C+ANNUITY%2C+LIFEWAY%2C+WMU%2C+ERLC%2C+SEMINARIES]</ref>

Critics sometimes use the word in a derisive manner and generally believe and teach that charismatics are everything from shallow to dangerous &mdash; even demon possessed, although this latter charge is increasingly rare as charismatic and Pentecostal groups become more established in the religious landscape.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

Criticism of the movement from outside of the Christian church partly stems from the alleged indoctrination of children at a young age.  This issue is highlighted in the documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]''.
