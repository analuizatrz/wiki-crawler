'''Jacob''' ('''Jacobus'''; sometimes '''James''') '''Metius''' (after [[1571]], [[Alkmaar]] - [[1628]], Alkmaar), was a [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] instrument-maker and [[optics|optician]].  He was born in [[Alkmaar]] and was the brother of [[Adriaan Adriaanszoon]] (simply called [[Metius]]).  A specialist in grinding [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], he claimed to have invented the [[telescope]].  Not much of him is known besides the fact that in October [[1608]], the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States General]] discussed his patent application for a device for "seeing faraway things as though nearby," consisting of a convex and concave lens in a tube, and the combination magnified three or four times.[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html]  He applied for his patent only a few weeks after [[Hans Lippershey]].

Metius informed the States General that he was familiar with the secrets of [[glassmaker|glassmaking]], and that he could make an even better telescope with the government's support.  When Metius perceived that the States General was reluctant to review his claim, he prohibited anyone from seeing his telescope.       

In his ''Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary'' ([[1795]]), [[Charles Hutton]] writes: 

:"In 1620, James Metius of Alcmaer, brother of Adrian Metius who was professor of mathematics at Franeker, came with Drebel to Middleburg, and there bought Telescopes of [[Zacharias Jansen|Jansen's]] children, who had made them public; and yet this Adr. Metius has given his brother the honour of the invention, in which too he is mistakenly followed by [[Descartes]]."[http://archimedes.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.cgi?dir=hutto_dicti_078_en_1795;step=textonly;corpus=&page=1291&n=1291]

The States General voted Jacob Metius a small award, although it ended up employing Lippershey to make binocular versions of the telescope.  At his death, Metiusâ€™ tools were destroyed according to his wishes in order to prevent anyone from claiming the honor of inventing the telescope.
