'''Ban Ki-moon''' ([[Hangul]]: 반기문, [[Hanja]]: 潘基文, [[Revised Romanization|RR]]: ''Ban Gi-mun'', [[McCune-Reischauer|M-R]]: Pan Kimun, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: {{IPA|[pan.gi.mun<!-- Please, don't edit [ban.gi.mun]. Hangul's 'ㅂ' is pronounced [p] (not [pʰ], like 'picture' in English), except that it is put between voiced sounds. -->]}}) (born [[June 13]] [[1944]] in [[Eumseong]], [[North Chungcheong]],<!--South Korea did not exist as a state in 1944 --> [[Korea]]<ref name=Times12-09/>) is a [[South Korea]]n [[diplomat]] and the current [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]]. 

Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban had been a career diplomat in South Korea's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].  He entered diplomatic service the year he graduated college, accepting his first post in [[New Delhi]].  In the foreign ministry he established a reputation for modesty and competence.  Ban was the [[Foreign Minister]] of [[South Korea|the Republic of Korea]] from January 2004 to [[November 1]] [[2006]]. On [[October 13]] [[2006]], he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].  On January 1, 2007, he succeeded [[Kofi Annan]].

==Early life==
Ban, the oldest of six children, was born in [[Eumseong]], in a small farming village in [[North Chungcheong]], in 1944, when Korea was [[Korea under Japanese rule|controlled by Japan]].  Ban was raised in [[Chungju]], a nearby town where his family moved when he was 3.<ref name="NYT 12-22"/>  As a child, Ban's father had a warehouse business, but the warehouse went bankrupt and the family lost its middle-class standard of living.  When Ban was 6, his family fled to a remote mountainside for the duration of the [[Korean War]].<ref name=Times12-09/>  After the war, Ban's family returned to [[Chungju]].  The U.S. military troops in Korea were the first Americans Ban ever met.<ref name=LAT10-09/>

===Education===
In secondary school Ban became a star pupil, particularly in his studies of English.  According to local stories, Ban would regularly walk 6 miles to a fertilizer factory to practice English with the factory's American advisors.<ref name="NYT 12-22"/>  In 1956, he was selected by his class to address a message to then U.N. Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], but it is unknown if the message was ever sent.  In 1962, Ban won an essay contest sponsored by the [[Red Cross]] and earned a trip to the [[United States]].  As part of the trip, Ban met U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name=Times12-09/>  When asked by a journalist at the meeting what Ban wanted to be when he grew up, he said "I want to become a diplomat."<ref name=LAT10-09/>

Ban received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[international relations|International Relations]] from [[Seoul National University]] in 1970 and earned a [[Master of Public Administration|Master of Public Administration]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1985.<ref name=LAT10-09>{{Cite news | title = Aspiring U.N. Chief Is a Harmonizer, Not a Rock Star; South Korean career diplomat Ban Ki-moon may lack charisma, but he has many fans | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | author = Maggie Farley and Bruce Wallace | date = 2006-10-09}}</ref>

===Personal===
Ban Ki-moon married his secondary school's student council president, Yoo Soon-taek, in 1971.  They are still married and have two daughters and a son.<ref name=Times12-09/>  In addition to his native [[Korean language|Korean]], Ban speaks [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[German language|German]], according to his [[curriculum vitae]]. However, there have been questions on the extent of his knowledge of [[French language|French]], one of the two working languages of the [[United Nations]].<ref name=Phoney/>

After his selection as U.N. Secretary General, Ban became an icon in his home town.  Over 50,000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration.  In the months after his appointment, thousands of practitioners of [[feng shui]] went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person.<ref name="NYT 12-22">{{Cite news | title = On His Ancestrs' Wings, a Korean Soars to the U.N. | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2006-12-22 | author = Martin Fackler}}</ref>

Ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8525903 | work = [[The Economist]] | title = Correction: Ban Ki-moon | date = 2007-01-11 | accessdate = 2007-08-02 }}</ref>  Ban's mother is reportedly a [[Buddhist]].<ref name="NYT 12-22"/>

==Diplomatic career==
[[Image:Ban Ki-moon and Condoleezza Rice.jpg|thumb|left|Ban Ki-moon with [[Condoleezza Rice]].]]
Ban joined the [[Foreign relations of South Korea|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in May 1970, and worked his way up during the years of the [[Yusin Constitution]].

His first overseas posting was to [[New Delhi]], after which he worked in the United Nations Division at the foreign ministry's headquarters. At the time of [[Park Chung Hee]]'s assassination, Ban had climbed to the position of First Secretary at South Korea's Permanent Observer Mission to the UN in [[New York City]] (South Korea only became a full UN member state on [[September 17]] [[1991]]). He subsequently assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division. He has been posted twice to the [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK) embassy in Washington, D.C. Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990&ndash;1992. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995. He was then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996, and assumed the office of Vice Minister in 2000.   Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.<ref name=Time/>

In [[1999]], while serving as [[Ambassador]] to [[Austria]], Ban was elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization ([[CTBTO]] PrepCom).  In what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, during the negotiations, he included a positive statement about the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] in a public letter with Russia in 2001, shortly after the [[United States]] had decided to abandon the treaty.  To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by Korean President [[Kim Dae-jung]], who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.<ref name=Times12-09/>

Ban lacked work for the only time in his life and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy.<ref name=Times12-09/>  In 2001, during the 56th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the Republic of Korea held the rotating presidency.  To his surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president [[Han Seung-soo]].  <ref name="Times10-14">{{Cite news | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2006-10-14 | title = South Korean Is Appointed Secretary General of the U.N. | author = [[Warren Hoge]]}}</ref>

In 2004, Ban replaced [[Yoon Young-kwan]] as foreign minister of Korea under president [[Roh Moo Hyun]].<ref name=LAT10-09/>  Ban has been actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relationships. In 1992, he served as Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)|North Korea]] of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the [[Korean Peninsula]].<ref name=BBCprofile>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5401856.stm | title = Profile: Ban Ki-moon | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 2006-10-13 | accessdate = 2007-08-04}}</ref> In September 2005, as [[Foreign Minister]], he played a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue at the Fourth Round of the [[Six-Party Talks]] held in [[Beijing]].<ref name="Official Bio"/><ref name="Newsweek">{{Cite news | title = A Baptism by Fire; Even before taking office, the newly elected secretary-general of the United Nations is confronted with a global crisis | date = 2006-10-23 | author = [[Lally Weymouth]] | work = [[Newsweek]]}}</ref>

=== Personality ===
Ban's personality has been described as bland.  In the Korean Foreign Ministry his nickname was "the Bureaucrat."  The Korean press corps calls him "the slippery eel" for his ability to dodge questions.<ref name=LAT10-09/>  His demeanor has also been described as a "[[Confucian]] approach."<ref name=Time>{{Cite news | title = Can This Guy Run the U.N.? | date = 2006-10-16 | work = [[Time Magazine]]}}</ref>

===Awards===
Ban has been awarded the Order of Service Merit by the Government of the [[Republic of Korea]] on three occasions: in 1975, 1986 and 2006.<ref name="Official Bio">{{Cite web | url = http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml | title = Official U.N. biography | work = un.org | accessdate = 2007-08-12}}</ref>  For his accomplishments as an envoy, he received the Grand Decoration of Honour from the [[Republic of Austria]] in 2001.  A year later, the government of [[Brazil]] bestowed the Grand Cross of Rio Branco upon him.  

In September 2005, the [[Korea Society]] in [[New York]] honored him with the [[James A. Van Fleet Award]] for his contributions to friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_detail.htm?No=39557|title=Samsung Chairman Lee Receives Van Fleet Award|date=[[2006-09-20]]|accessdate=2006-09-28|publisher=[http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/ KBS World]}}</ref>

==Campaign for Secretary-General==
[[Image:Yudhoyono_BanKiMoon.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon with Indonesian President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]].]]
 
In [[February 2006]], Ban declared his candidacy to replace [[Kofi Annan]] as UN Secretary-General at the end of 2006, becoming the first South Korean to run for the office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200602/kt2006021416334111990.htm|title=Minister Ban to Run for Top UN Job|author=Song-wu, Park|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2006-09-28|date=[[2006-02-14]]}}</ref>  Over the next eight months, Ban made ministerial visits to every country with a seat on the security council.<ref name=LAT10-09/>  He topped each of the four [[straw poll]]s conducted by the [[UN Security Council]] on [[July 24]],<ref>{{cite  web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/115|title=Ban takes 1st Straw Poll|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006-07-24]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> [[14 September]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/138|title=Ban firms up lead in second Straw Poll|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006-09-14]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> [[September 28]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/164|title=Ban slips but holds, Vike Freiberga pushes into third|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006-09-28]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> and [[October 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/170|title=Ban Ki-moon wins|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006-10-02]]|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> 

<!-- [[Image:BUSHBANKI.jpg|thumb|300px|left|President [[George W. Bush]] talks with [[United Nations Secretary-General]] Designate Ban Ki-moon of the [[Republic of Korea]].]] -->
On [[September 25]], [[2006]], while these polls were being conducted, Ban addressed the [[Asia Society]] in New York on his candidacy and views on major issues confronting the UN.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/06ny_ban.html | date = 2006-09-25 | accessdate = 2007-08-02 | work = Ban Ki-moon address to Asia Society (transcript) | title = The Quest for Peace and Prosperity in the Asia-Pacific and Beyond}}</ref> The next day he gave an interview to the Asia Society's ''AsiaSource'', focusing again on the upcoming challenges to be faced by the UN. Earlier in the year he had addressed the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/kimoon.cfm | work = Asiasource.org | title = Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon interview | date = 2006-09-26 | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>

In order to be confirmed Ban needed to be able to avoid a veto from each of the five permanent members of the council — [[People's Republic of China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].  Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq.  Ban also opposed several U.S. interests: he expressed his support for the [[International Criminal Court]] and favored an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea.<ref name=LAT10-09/>  Ban has said that he would like to visit North Korea and meet with [[Kim Jong Il]] directly.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

Subsequently, in an informal poll on [[October 2]], Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention ("no opinion") from the fifteen members of the Security Council.  More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto, while each of the five other candidates received at least one "no" vote from the five permanent members.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1104AP_UN_Next_Chief.html | title=Ban vows to reform U.N. if given top job|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=[[2006-10-03]] | accessdate=2006-10-09}}</ref>  After the vote, [[Shashi Tharoor]], who finished second, withdrew his candidacy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/morenews/showmorestory.asp?id=94211|title=Shashi Tharoor pulls out of UN race|publisher=[http://www.ndtv.com/ NDTV.com]|date=[[2006-10-02]]|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> and [[China|China's]] Permanent Representative to the UN told reporters that "it is quite clear from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so061002pm3.rm | title = United Nations Webcast of announcement | work = [[United Nations]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>

{{wikinews|General Assembly elects Ban Ki-moon as next UN chief}}
On [[October 9]], the Security Council formally chose Ban as its nominee. On [[October 13]], the 192-member [[UNGA|General Assembly]] adopted a resolution, by [[acclamation]], appointing Ban as Secretary-General.<ref name="Times10-14"/>

==Term as Secretary-General==
[[Image:Ban Ki-moon Bush.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon with [[George W. Bush]]]]
When Ban became secretary-general, ''[[The Economist]]'' listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: "rising nuclear demons in Iran and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in Darfur, unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the spread of HIV/AIDs.  And then the more parochial concerns, such as the largely unfinished business of the most sweeping attempt at reform in the UN's history."<ref name=Econ01-06/>

On [[January 1]], [[2007]] Ban took office as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations.  His first foreign trip was to attend the [[African Union]] summit in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]] in January of 2007 as part of an effort to reach out to the [[Group of 77]].<ref name=Econ01-06>{{Cite news | title = Mission impossible? - The United Nations | date = 2007-01-06 | work = [[The Economist]]}}</ref>

On the issue on [[Taiwan]]'s status, Ban remains conservative in action. In 2007, Nauru, raised the issue of allowing the Republic of China to sign The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], Ban reacted by referencing the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], refused this motion on the grounds that The Republic of China does not have the requirements to sign the convention.<ref name=Taipei>{{Cite news | url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/07/30/2003371907 | title = MOFA spokesman slams Ban Ki-moon for rejecting UN bid | date = 2007-07-30 | accessdate = 2007-08-30 | work = [[Taipei Times]]}}</ref>

On 19th, July, 2007, the President of the Republic of China wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan. Ban rejected this request without the consultation of the reviewing office, as normal procedures dictate.


===Baghdad attack===
On Thursday, [[March 22]], [[2007]], while taking part in a press conference in [[Baghdad]]'s [[green zone]], a mortar attack hit close to where the [[Secretary-General]] was standing, interrupting the conference and visibly shaking Ban and others.  No one was hurt in the [[incident]].<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/23/content_5884102.htm Rocket blast shakes UN chief in Baghdad] Xinhua - 2007-03-23</ref>

===Criticism===
Ban's official biography states that he speaks both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], the two working languages of the UN Secretariat. He has struggled to answer questions in French from journalists, notably at the press conference following his induction as UN Secretary General.<ref name=Phoney>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/herland/20061214.html|title=Is Ban Ki-moon a franco-phoney?|work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]] | date = 2006-12-14 | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref> Acknowledging his limitations at his next press conference on [[11 January]], Ban remarked, “my French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons over the last few months. I think that, even if my French isn't perfect, I will continue to study it.” <ref>{{Cite web | url =  http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2407 | work = [[United Nations]] | title = Secretary-General's press conference | date = 2007-01-11 | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>

As the election of the successor to the Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] drew closer there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging [[foreign aid]] to [[developing countries]] were the focus of some news articles.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2380336,00.html | title = Millions of dollars and a piano may put Korean in UN's top job | work = [[The Times]] | date = 2006-09-26 | accessdate = 2007-08-02}} </ref>

According to the ''[[Washington Post]],'' "rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy". Ban reportedly has said that these insinuations are "groundless". In an interview on [[17 September]] [[2006]] he reportedly stated: "As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process" and "I am a man of integrity."<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801765.html | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2006-09-28 | accessdate = 2007-08-02 | title = S. Korean Contender for U.N. Post Has an Edge}}</ref>

Perhaps an attempt at a comeback to claims of a lack of charisma would explain his singing of a version of ''[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]'', where he replaced the words 'Santa Claus' with his own name at the 2006 UN Correspondents dinner early in December.<ref name="AR2007011202061.html">{{cite news | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011202061.html | title = Don't Ban Your Instincts, Ban Ki-moon | accessdate=2007-04-13 | date = 2007-01-12 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

Opponents of capital punishment voiced concern when Ban, at his first encounter with the press as Secretary-General on [[2 January]] [[2007]], refused to condemn the [[death penalty]] imposed on [[Saddam Hussein]] by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking that “The issue of capital punishment is for each and every Member State to decide.” <ref>{{Cite web | url =  http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=964 | work = [[United Nations]] | title = Secretary-General's encounter with the UN press corps (transcript)| date = 2007-01-02 | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref> He quickly clarified his stand in the case of [[Barzan al-Tikriti]] and [[Awad al-Bandar]], two top officials who were convicted of the deaths of 148 Shia Muslims in the Iraqi village of [[Dujail]] in the [[1980s]]. In a statement through his spokesperson on [[6 January]], he “strongly urged the Government of Iraq to grant a stay of execution to those whose death sentences may be carried out in the near future.” <ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2395 | title = Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General on the death sentences in Iraq | work = [[United Nations]] | date = 2007-01-06 | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref> On the broader issue, he told a Washington, D.C., audience on [[16 January]] that he recognized and encouraged the “growing trend in international society, international law and domestic policies and practices to phase out eventually the death penalty.”<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2410 | title = Address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Q&A (transcript)| work = [[United Nations]] | date = 2007-01-16 | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>
