:''This article is mainly about the spoken Korean language.  See [[Hangul]] for details on the native Korean writing system.''

'''Korean''' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국어|한국어]]/[[wikt:조선말|조선말]]}}, see [[#Names|below]]) is the official [[language]] of both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]. It is also one of the two official languages in the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. There are about 80 million Korean speakers, with large groups in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]],  [[Post-Soviet states]], and more recently the [[Philippines]]. 

The genealogical [[#Classification|classification]] of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] language family, while others consider it to be a [[language isolate]]. It is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] in its morphology and [[Subject Object Verb|SOV]] in its [[syntax]]. Like the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] languages, Korean language was influenced by the [[Chinese language]] in the form of [[Sino-Korean]] words.  Native Korean words account for about 35% of the Korean vocabulary, while about 60% of the Korean vocabulary consists of Sino-Korean words.  The remaining 5% comes from loan words from other languages, 90% of which are from [[English language|English]].<ref>Sohn, Ho-Min.

==Names==
The Korean names for the language are based on the [[Names of Korea|names for Korea]] used in North and South Korea.

In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called ''Chosŏnmal'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:조선말|조선말]]}}; with [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko|朝鮮말}}), or more formally, ''Chosŏnŏ'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:조선어|조선어]]}};  {{lang|ko|朝鮮語}}).

In the Republic of Korea, the language is most often called ''Hangungmal''
<!-- -->
<!-- ATTENTION! -->
<!-- To our very passionate users who tend to change "Hangungmal" to "Hangugmal" / "Hangukmal", the correct one is indeed [[Media:"HanguNGmal]]", yes, with the "ng" and not just "g", which is due to consonant assimilation by the following consonant "m".  Please REFRAIN from changing it to "Hangugmal"! Additionally, Korean is not like Chinese or Japanese, where Xi'an is different from Xian / an'i is ''different from ani, so please do not put apostrophes between characters in their transliterations. Hyphens'' may be used for disambiguation, but should not be used for anything else. -->

({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국말|한국말]]}}; {{lang|ko|韓國말}}), or more formally, ''Hangugeo'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국어|한국어]]}}; {{lang|ko|韓國語}}) or ''Gugeo'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:국어|국어]]}}; {{lang|ko|國語}}; literally "national language").  It is sometimes colloquially called ''urimal'' ("our language"; {{lang|ko|[[wikt:우리말|우리말]]}} in one word in South Korea, {{lang|ko|[[wikt:우리|우리]] [[wikt:말|말]]}} with a space in North Korea).

On the other hand, Korean people in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]], who refer to themselves as [[Koryo-saram]] (also ''Goryeoin'' [{{lang|ko|고려인}}; {{lang|ko|高麗人}}; literally, "[[Names of Korea#Historic Names|Goryeo]] person(s)"]) call the language ''[[Koryo-mar|Goryeomal]]'' ({{lang|ko|고려말}}; {{lang|ko|高麗말}}).

==Classification==
The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a [[language isolate]].

Since the publication of the article of [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|Ramstedt]] in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including [[grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Article (grammar)|articles]], fusional morphology, voice, and [[relative pronoun]]s (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely [[Sakha language|Sakha (Yakut)]]. Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other [[Turkic languages]] or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages.<ref>{{cite paper|title=The Typology of Adverbial Agreement|url=http://mercury.hau.ac.kr/kggc/Monthly/ReadingMaterial/Typology.doc|author=Vinokurova, Nadya|date=1999-04-08|accessdate=2007-01-15|format=Microsoft Word}}</ref>

It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to [[Japanese language|Japanese]], since the two languages have a similar grammatical structure.  Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the [[Buyeo languages]] of [[Goguryeo language|Goguryeo]] and [[Baekje]] (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje ''mir'', Japanese ''mi-'' "three".<ref name="Beckwith">{{cite book|title=Koguryo, The Language Of Japan's Continental Relatives: the language of Japan's continental|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|date=2004|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|id=ISBN 9004139494}}</ref>

Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a ''[[sprachbund]]'' effect.  See [[East Asian languages#Morphology|East Asian languages]] for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian ''sprachbund'', and [[Japanese language classification]] for further details on the possible relationship.

Of the ancient languages attested in the Korean Peninsula, modern Korean is believed to be a descendent of the languages of [[Samhan]] and [[Silla]]; it is unknown whether these are related to the Buyeo languages, though many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the [[Goryeo]] period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|Seven-Year War]] brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The [[Jeju dialect]] preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose ''arae a'' is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.

There are also fringe theories proposing various other relationships; for example, a few linguists such as Homer B. Hulbert have also tried to relate Korean to the [[Dravidian languages]] through the similar syntax in both.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Korea's Geographical Significance|last=Hulbert|first=Homer|journal=Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York|volume=32|issue=4|date=1900|pages=322-327|doi=10.2307/197061}}</ref>

==Dialects==
{{main|Korean dialects}}
[[Image:Koreandialects.PNG|thumb|180px|Dialects of Korean]]
Korean has several [[dialect]]s (called ''mal'' [literally "speech"], ''saturi'', or ''bang-eon'' in Korean). The [[standard language]] (''pyojuneo'' or ''pyojunmal'') of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around [[Seoul]], and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around [[Pyongyang|P'yŏngyang]]. These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of [[Jeju]] Island (see [[Jeju Dialect]]). The dialect spoken in [[Jeju Dialect|Jeju]] is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of [[Seoul dialect]] use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] have a very pronounced intonation.

It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive [[dialect levelling]], or even [[convergent evolution]] or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean {{IPA|/ip/}} "mouth" or Gyeongsang dialect {{IPA|/ʨʌŋ.gu.ʥi/}} vs. Standard Korean {{IPA|/puːʨʰu/}} "[[garlic chives]]." This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  See also the [[Buyeo languages]] [[hypothesis]].

There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the [[regions of Korea]], since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.  Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol <{{IPA|͈}}> (a subscript double straight quotation mark) is used to denote the tensed consonants {{IPA|/p͈/, /t͈/, /k͈/, /ʨ͈/, /s͈/}}. Its official use in the [[Extended IPA]] is for [[Fortis and lenis|'strong']] articulation, but is used in the literature for [[faucalized voice]]. The Korean consonants also have elements of [[stiff voice]], but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted [[glottis]] and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.

|}

===Phonology===
{{IPA|/s/}} becomes an [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] {{IPA|[ɕ]}} before {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[i]}} for most speakers (but see [[Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea]]). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot (버섯) 'mushroom').<!-- it's actually much more complicated than this, isn't it?-->

{{IPA|/h/}} may become a [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}} before {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[u]}}, a [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{IPA|[ç]}} before {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[i]}}, a [[velar consonant|velar]] {{IPA|[x]}} before {{IPA|[ɯ]}}, a voiced {{IPA|[ɦ]}} between voiced sounds, and a {{IPA|[h]}} elsewhere.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

{{IPA|/p, t, ʨ, k/}} become voiced {{IPA|[b, d, ʥ, g]}} between voiced sounds.

{{IPA|/l/}} becomes alveolar flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels, and {{IPA|[l]}} or {{IPA|[ɭ]}} at the end of a syllable or next to another {{IPA|/l/}}.  Note that a written syllable-final 'ㄹ', when followed by a vowel or a glide (''i.e.'', when the next character starts with 'ㅇ'), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes {{IPA|[ɾ]}}.

Traditionally, {{IPA|/l/}} was disallowed at the beginning of a word.  It disappeared before {{IPA|[j]}}, and otherwise became {{IPA|/n/}}.  However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or {{IPA|[l]}}.  The traditional prohibition of word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} became a morphological rule called "initial law" (두음법칙) in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary.  Such words retain their word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} in North Korea.

All [[obstruent]]s (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]] {{IPA|[p̚, t̚, k̚]}} at the end of a word. 

Plosive stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become nasal stops {{IPA|[m, n, ŋ]}} before nasal stops. 

[[Hangul]] spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. 

One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial {{IPA|[r]}}, and initial {{IPA|[n]}}. For example,
* "labour" - north: '''''r'''odong'' (로동), south: '''''n'''odong'' (노동)
* "history" - north: '''''ry'''ŏksa'' (력사), south: '''''y'''eoksa'' (역사)
* "female" - north: '''''ny'''ŏja'' (녀자), south: '''''y'''eoja'' (여자)

==Grammar==
=== Sentence structure ===
Korean is an [[agglutinative language]]. Modifiers precede the modified word.  The basic form of a Korean sentence is [[Subject Object Verb]], but the verb is the only required and immovable element. 

:'''A''': "가게에 가세요?" ''(gage-e gaseyo?)''
:'''B''': "네." ''(ne.)''

''Literal translation'':
:'''A''': *"store (가게) + to(에) + go(가) +[polite interrogative marker]?"
:'''B''': "Yes."

''English equivalent'':
:'''A''': "Going to the store?"
:'''B''': "Yes."

=== Parts of speech ===
==== Verb ====
Korean [[verb]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:동사|동사]]}}, ''dongsa'', {{lang|ko|動詞}}) are also known in English as "action verbs" or "dynamic verbs" to distinguish them from ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:형용사|형용사]]}}, ''hyeong-yongsa'', "adjectives"), which are also known as "descriptive verbs" or "stative verbs".

Examples include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:하다|하다]]}} (''hada'', "to do, to have") and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:가다|가다]]}} (''gada'', "to go").  For a larger list of Korean verbs, see [[wikt:Category:Korean verbs]].

Unlike most European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners.
The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the [[T-V distinction]] of most [[Indo-European languages]].  For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.

==== Adjective ====
Words categorized as Korean [[adjective]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:형용사|형용사]]}}, ''hyeong-yongsa'', {{lang|ko|形容詞}}) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them "descriptive verbs" or "[[stative verb]]s", but they are distinctly separate from {{lang|ko|동사}} (''dongsa'').

English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs.  For example, {{lang|ko|[[wikt:붉다|붉다]]}} (''bukda'') translates literally as "to be red" and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:아쉽다|아쉽다]]}} (''aswipda'') often best translates as "to lack" or "to want for", but both are {{lang|ko|형용사}} (''hyeong-yongsa'', "adjectives").  For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see [[wikt:Category:Korean adjectives]].

==== Determiner ====
Korean [[Determiner (class)|determiners]] ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:관형사|관형사]]}}, ''gwanhyeongsa'', 冠形詞) are also known in English as "determinatives", "adnominals", "pre-nouns", "attributives", and "unconjugated adjectives".  Examples include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:각|각]]}} (''gak'', "each") and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:느린|느린]]}} (''neurin'',"slow").  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean determiners]].

==== Noun ====
Korean [[noun]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:명사|명사]]}}, ''myeongsa'', 名詞) are also known in English as "substantives".  Examples include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:가족|가족]]}} (''gajok'', "household") and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:맛|맛]]}} (''mat'', "flavor").  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean nouns]].

==== Pronoun ====
Korean [[pronoun]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:대명사|대명사]]}}, ''daemyeongsa'', 代名詞) include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:나|나]]}} (''na'', "I") and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:그|그]]}} (''geu'').  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean pronouns]].

==== Adverb ====
Korean [[adverb]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:부사|부사]]}}, ''busa'', 副詞) include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:또|또]]}} (''tto'', "also") and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:가득|가득]]}} (''gadeuk'', "fully").  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean adverbs]].

==== Particle ====
Korean [[Grammatical particle|particles]] ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:조사|조사]]}}, ''josa'', 助詞) are also known in English as "[[Adposition|postpositions]]".  Examples include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:는|는]]}} (''neun'', topic marker) and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:를|를]]}} (''reul'', object marker).  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean particles]].

==== Interjection ====
Korean [[interjection]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:감탄사|감탄사]]}}, ''gamtansa'', 歎詞 ) are also known in English as "exclamations".  Examples include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:아니|아니]]}} (''ani'', "no").  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean interjections]].

==== Number ====
Korean [[number]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:수사|수사]]}}, ''susa'', 數詞) are also known in English as "numerals".

== Speech levels and honorifics ==
{{main|Korean honorifics}}

The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in '''[[honorific]]s''', while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in '''speech level'''.

===Honorifics===

When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like.

===Speech levels===

There are no fewer than 7 verb [[paradigm]]s or '''speech levels''' in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike "honorifics" &mdash; which are used to show respect towards the referent of a subject &mdash; '''speech levels''' are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific [[imperative]] form of the verb 하다 (''hada'', "do") in each level, plus the suffix 체 ('che', [[Hanja]]: <span lang="KO">體</span>), which means "style."

The highest 5 levels are generally grouped together as ''jondaemal'' (존대말), while the lowest 2 levels (''haeche'', 해체) are called ''banmal'' (반말) in Korean.

==Vocabulary==
The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. More than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 70% by some estimates), however, especially scholarly terminology, are [[Sino-Korean]] words{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, either
* directly borrowed from [[Written Chinese]], or
* coined in Japan or Korea using [[Chinese characters]].

Korean has two [[Korean numerals|number systems]]: one native, and one borrowed from the Chinese.

To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Sanskrit]], and other languages. 
Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the [[Tsushima dialect]] of Japanese.

In modern times, many words have been borrowed from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[European languages|Western languages]] such as [[German language|German]] (''[[wikt:アルバイト|areubaiteu]]'' ‘part-time job’, ''allereugi'' ‘allergy’) and more recently [[English language|English]]. Concerning daily usage vocabulary except what can be written in hanja, more words have possibly been borrowed from English than from any other language. Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example ‘dozen’&nbsp;> {{lang|ja-Kana|ダース}} ''dāsu''&nbsp;> {{lang|ko-Hang|다스}} ''daseu''. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as ‘German(y)’ (see [[Names for Germany#Japanese and Korean|Names for Germany]]), the first part of whose [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] {{IPA|[ˈd̥ɔɪ̯ʧʷ.la̠ntʰ]}} the Japanese approximated using the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja-Hant|獨逸}} <!-- kyūjitai, no 独 please --> ''doitsu'' that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: {{lang|ko-Hant|[[wikt:獨|獨]]}}&nbsp;''dok'' + {{lang|ja-Hant|[[wikt:逸|逸]]}}&nbsp;''il'' = ''[[wikt:독일|Dogil]]''. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.

North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

==Writing system==
{{Korean writing}}
{{main|Hangul}}
{{See also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}}
In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using [[Chinese character]]s, using [[hyangchal]] or [[idu]]. Knowledge of such systems were lost, and the Korean language was not written at all; the aristocracy used [[Classical Chinese]] for its writing.

Korean is now mainly written in [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet, optionally [[Korean with mixed script of Hangul and Hanja|mixing in Hanja]] to write [[Sino-Korean]] words. South Korea still teaches 1800 Hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Modern Korean is written with [[space (punctuation)|space]]s between [[word]]s, a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean [[punctuation]] marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.

==Differences between North Korea and South Korea==
{{main|Korean language North-South differences}}
The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.<ref>Kanno, Hiroomi (ed.) / Society for Korean Linguistics in Japan (1987). ''Chōsengo o manabō'' (『朝鮮語を学ぼう』), Sanshūsha, Tokyo. ISBN 4-384-01506-2</ref>

===Pronunciation===
In North Korea, [[palatalization]] of {{IPA|/si/}} is optional, and {{IPA|/ʨ/}} can be pronounced as {{IPA|[z]}} in between vowels.

Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below.  The pronunciations below are given in [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization]], [[McCune-Reischauer]] and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja "的" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ㄴ, ㅁ or ㅇ. (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)

===Spelling===
Some words are spelt differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

===Spelling and pronunciation===
Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the "Phonology" section above:

{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="4" |Word
! rowspan="2" |Meaning
! rowspan="2" |Remarks
|-
! North spelling

|-
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|력량}}
| ryeongryang (ryŏngryang)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|역량}}
| yeongnyang (yŏngnyang)
| strength
| Korean words originally starting in ''r'' or ''n'' have their ''r'' or ''n'' dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an ''i'' or ''y'' sound.
|-
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|로동}}
| rodong (rodong)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|노동}}
| nodong (nodong)
| work
| Korean words originally starting in ''r'' have their ''r'' changed to ''n'' in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than ''i'' or ''y''.
|-
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|원쑤}}
| wonssu (wŏnssu)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|원수}}
| wonsu (wŏnsu)
| enemy
| "Enemy" and "head of state" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to [[Kim Il-sung]] / [[Kim Jong-il]] as the enemy, the second syllable of "enemy" is written and pronounced 쑤 in the North.
|-

| kkuba (kkuba)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|쿠바}}
| kuba (k'uba)

| When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.
|-
|{{lang|ko-Hang-KP|페}}
|pe (p'e)
|{{lang|ko-Hang-KR|폐}}
|pye (p'ye),  pe (p'e)
|lungs
|All hanja pronounced as ''pye'' (''p'ye'') or ''pe'' (''p'e'') in the South are pronounced as ''pe'' (''p'e'') in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.
|}

In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:

|-
! North spelling
! North pronun.

| doeyeotda (toeyŏtta)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|되었다}}
| doeeotda (toeŏtta)
| past tense of 되다 (doeda/toeda), "to become"
| All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in ㅣ in the stem (i.e. ㅣ, ㅐ, ㅔ, ㅚ, ㅟ and ㅢ) in the North use 여 instead of the South's 어.
|-
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|고마와요}}
| gomawayo (komawayo)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|고마워요}}
| gomawoyo (komawŏyo)
| thanks
| ㅂ-irregular verbs in the North use 와 (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.
|-
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|할가요}}
| halgayo (halkayo)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|할까요}}
| halkkayo (halkkayo)
| Shall we do?
| Although the hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed ㄲ sound).

| gwakbap (kwakpap)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|도시락}}
| dosirak (tosirak)
| lunch box
|
|}

===Others===
In the North, [[guillemet]]s {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|《}} and {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|》}} are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones, “ and ”, are standard, although {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|『 』}} and {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|「 」}} are sometimes used in popular novels.
