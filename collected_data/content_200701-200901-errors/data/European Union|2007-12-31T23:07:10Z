The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a political and economic community of twenty-seven [[European Union member state|member states]] with [[supranationalism|supranational]] and [[intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] features, located primarily in [[Europe]]. It traces its origins to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) formed in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]] between six European countries. Since then the EU has grown in size through the accession of new member states and has increased its powers by the addition of new policy areas to its remit. In 1993, the [[Maastricht Treaty]] established the current legal framework. The [[Lisbon Treaty]] signed in December 2007 initiates a ratification process in 2008 and is amending the existing treaties. It is intended to come into force on January 1, 2009.

The EU creates a [[single market]] by a system of laws which apply in all [[European Union member state|member states]], guaranteeing the [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital]].<ref name="Europa Internal Market">{{cite web |title=The EU Single Market: Fewer barriers, more opportunities |publisher=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-09-27}}; {{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Activities of the European Union: Internal Market|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>
It maintains a common trade policy, [[Common Agricultural Policy|agricultural]] and [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]] policies, and a [[European Union Regional policy|regional development policy]].<ref name="Farah">{{cite web|last=Farah|first=Paolo|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Five Years of China WTO Membership.

It has also developed a role in [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]], and in justice and home affairs. Passport control between many member states has been abolished under the [[Schengen Agreement]].<ref name="Internal borders"> {{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Abolition of internal borders and creation of a single EU external frontier|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=2005|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/freetravel/frontiers/fsj_freetravel_schengen_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

With almost 500 million citizens, the EU generates an estimated 31% share of the world's nominal [[gross domestic product|GDP]] ([[US$]]16.6 trillion) in 2007.<ref name="GDP IMF"/> It represents its members in the [[WTO]] and observes at [[G8]] summits and at the [[UN]]. Twenty-one EU countries are members of [[NATO]]. Important institutions of the EU include the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Council]], the [[European Court of Justice]] and the [[European Central Bank]]. [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] elect the Parliament every five years.

==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
The political climate after the end of [[World War II]] favoured Western European unity, seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of nationalism which had devastated the continent.<ref>{{cite web |title=The political consequences |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu/?doc=242&lang=3 |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> One successful proposal for European cooperation came in 1951 with the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. This had the aim of bringing together control of the coal and steel industries of its member states (principally [[France]] and [[West Germany]]), with the aim that war between them would not then be possible. Its founders declared it "a first step in the federation of Europe", with the hope that this would enable Europe to pursue the development of Africa. <ref>{{cite web |title=Declaration of 9 May 1950 |url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> The other founding members were [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name="Europa History 45-59">{{cite web |title=A peaceful Europe - the beginnings of cooperation |publisher=European Commission |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1945-1959/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

Two additional communities were created in 1957: the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) establishing a [[Customs Union]], and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) for cooperation in developing [[nuclear energy]].<ref name="Europa History 45-59"/> In 1967 the [[Merger Treaty]] created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the ''European Communities'', although more commonly just as the ''European Community'' (EC).<ref name="ENA Merge">{{cite web |title=Merging the executives |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=473 |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

In 1973 the European Communities enlarged to include [[Denmark]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="ENA First enlargement">{{cite web |title=The first enlargement |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=555 |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> [[Norway]] had negotiated to join at the same time but a referendum rejected membership and so it remained outside.  The [[European Parliament election, 1979|first direct, democratic elections]] of members of the European Parliament were held in 1979.<ref name="ENA New Parliament">{{cite web |title=The new European Parliament |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=571 |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

[[Image:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Iron Curtain]]'s fall enabled eastward [[EU enlargement|enlargement]]. ([[Berlin Wall]])]]

[[Greece]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] joined in the 1980s.<ref name="ENA Enlargement negotiations">{{cite web |title=Negotiations for enlargement |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=6525  |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> In 1985 the [[Schengen Agreement]] created largely open borders without passport controls between those states adopting it.<ref name="Europa History 90-99">{{cite web |title=A Europe without frontiers |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> In 1986 the [[European flag]] began to be used and leaders signed the [[Single European Act]]. This revised the way community decision making operated in light of its greater membership, aimed to further reduce trade barriers and introduce greater [[European Political Cooperation]]. In 1990 after the fall of the [[iron curtain]], the former [[East Germany]] became part of the Community as part of a newly reunited Germany.<ref name="Europa History 80-89">{{cite web |title=1980-1989 The changing face of Europe - the fall of the Berlin Wall |publisher=European Commission| url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1980-1989/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> With enlargement toward eastern Europe on the agenda, the [[Copenhagen Criteria]] for candidate members to join the European Union were agreed.

The [[Maastricht Treaty]] came into force on [[1 November]] [[1993]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Treaty of Maastricht on European Union |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/treaties/maastricht_en.htm |work=Activities of the European Union |publisher=The European Commission |accessdate=2007-10-20}}; {{cite book |last=Craig |first=Paul |coauthors=Grainne De Burca , P.

At the same time the name 'European Union' was adopted in relation to foreign policy co-operation, which was the responsibility of the Council and not the institutions of the Community. However, thereafter 'European Union' became the name in general use (and the 'Union' will replace the 'Community' when the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] comes into force). 
 
[[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|The 1957 [[Treaty of Rome|Rome Treaty]] created the [[European Community|European Economic Community]]]]
[[Austria]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] joined in 1995. The [[Amsterdam Treaty]] in 1997 amended the Maastricht treaty in areas such as democracy and foreign policy. Amsterdam was followed by the [[Treaty of Nice]] in 2001, which revised the Rome and Maastricht treaties to allow the EU to cope with further enlargement to the east. In 2002 [[euro]] notes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. In 2004 ten new countries (eight of which had formerly been [[Eastern Bloc]] countries) joined the EU.<ref name="Europa History 00">{{cite web |title=A decade of further expansion |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>
At the start of 2007 [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] joined the EU and the euro was adopted by [[Slovenia]].<ref name="Europa History 00"/>

A treaty establishing a [[European Constitution|constitution for the EU]] was signed in Rome in 2004, intended to replace all previous treaties with a new single document. However, it never completed ratification after rejection by French and Dutch voters in [[referenda]]. In 2007, it was agreed to replace that proposal with a new [[Reform Treaty]], that would amend rather than replace the [[Treaties of the European Union|existing treaties]]. This treaty was signed on December 13th in Lisbon and will be known as the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon treaty]]. It will come in effect in January 2009 if ratified by that date.

==Member states==
{{main|European Union member state|Enlargement of the European Union}}
{{European Union Labelled Map (blue)}}
The European Union currently has 27 [[Independence|independent]] [[sovereign]] [[country|countries]] which are collectively known as member states: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], the [[Republic Of Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web |title=European Countries |url=http://www.europa.eu/abc/european_countries/index_en.htm |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> There are currently three official candidate countries, [[Croatia]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Turkey]]. In addition the western Balkan countries of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]] are officially recognised as potential candidates.<ref name="Europa Enlargement">{{cite web |title=European Commission - Enlargement - Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries |publisher=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

To join the EU, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 [[Copenhagen]] European Council. These require a stable democracy which respects [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning market economy capable of competition within the EU; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria rests with the [[European Council]].<ref name="Accession Criteria">{{cite web |title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria) |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

A number of Western European countries who have chosen not to join the EU have nevertheless been partly integrated into the EU's economy. [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]] are a part of the [[Common Market|Single market]] through the [[European Economic Area]] while [[Switzerland]] has similar ties through [[bilateral]] treaties. The [[Microstates and the European Union|microstates' relationships]]<ref name="microstates'>European microstates: [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Vatican City]]</ref> include use of the [[euro]] and other co-operation.<ref name="EEA"/><ref name="CH">{{cite web |title=The EU's relations with Switzerland|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/switzerland/intro/index.htm |accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref><ref name="euro use world"/>

The territory of the EU is not the same as that of continental [[Geography of Europe|Europe]], nor does it restrict itself solely to Europe. Some parts of member countries are not part of the EU, such as the European [[Channel Islands]] and [[Faroe Islands]]), or outside Europe [[Greenland]], [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and all the non-European territories associated with the [[United Kingdom]]. On the other hand, some [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories]] are formally part of the EU even though they are not geographically part of Europe, such as the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Madeira]], [[Martinique]] and [[Réunion]].<ref name="Amsterdam">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Treaty of Amsterdam|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Eur-Lex]]: Official Journal|date=|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref><ref name="Consolidated Treaties">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Consolidated Treaties on European Union and establishing the European Community|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Eur-Lex]]|date=|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2006:321E:0001:0331:EN:pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ECB where euro">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Where is the euro legal tender?|work=|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|date=2006|url=http://www.ecb.int/bc/faqbc/circulation/html/index.en.html#q2|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|Institutions of the European Union}}
[[Image:Institutions europeennes IMG 4307.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Strasbourg]] [[European Parliament|Parliament]] is one of the EU's two [[legislature]]s]]

The EU is regulated by a number of institutions, primarily the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], and [[European Parliament]]. 

The [[European Commission|Commission]] acts as the EU's [[executive branch|executive arm]] and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU. It is currently composed of 27 commissioners, one from each member state. The President of the Commission and all the other commissioners are nominated by the Council. Appointment of the Commission President and also the Commission in its entirety, have to be confirmed by Parliament.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission">{{cite web |title=Institutions: The European Commission |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The [[Council of the European Union]] (also known as the Council of Ministers, and called the [[European Council]] if composed of the heads of government) forms one half of the EU's [[legislative branch]]. It is composed of the national ministers responsible for the area of policy being addressed. Although the Council meets in different compositions, it is considered to be one single body.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council">{{cite web |title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises executive functions in relations to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].
 
Highest-ranking political leadership in the EU is primarily provided by the [[European Council]] (not to be mistaken for the [[Council of Europe]]), which is the [[Council of the European Union]], meeting in the specific composition of the heads of government of the member states (e.g. the [[prime minister]] in case of the [[United Kingdom]]), plus the President of the [[European Commission]]. The European Council meets up to four times a year, is headed by the head of government of the member state which is holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and has the task to define overall EU policy and to deal with matters that could not be resolved by the ministers at normal Council meetings.<ref name="The Council of the European Union">{{cite web |title=The Council of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

[[Image:European Commission outside.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brussels]] is home to the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and [[European Commission|Commission]] ''(pictured)''.]]

The rotating ''presidency in the Council'' is taken by each member state in turn for a period of six months, during which the relevant member chairs all meetings of the European Council and the Council of ministers.<ref name="Europa Institutions ECouncil">{{cite web |title=European Council |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]] |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=429&lang=en |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> The member state holding the presidency typically uses it to drive a particular policy agenda such as economic reform, reform of the EU itself, enlargement or furthering European integration.

The other half of the EU's [[legislative branch]] is the [[European Parliament]]. The 785 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are directly elected by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] every five years. Although members of parliament are elected on a national basis, they sit according to [[European Parliament political group|political groups]] rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats. Parliament has near-equal legislative powers with the Council in [[European Community|Community matters]] and has the power to reject or censure the Commission. The [[President of the European Parliament]] carries out the role of [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] in parliament and represents it to other organisations.

In all but a few cases, the Commission has the sole right to [[legislative initiative|initiate legislation]]. This is usually in the form of a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], a directly applicable [[Act of Parliament|act]], or a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] which states must implement under national law.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Community legal instruments|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> Once legislation has been proposed there are three alternative [[European Union legislative procedure|EU legislative procedures]] which may be followed to implement it. In most cases it is the [[codecision procedure]] which gives equal rights to Parliament and Council who must both agree before it comes into force. In other procedures, the Parliament has fewer powers.<ref name="decision making">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

===Politics===
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}

The EU is often described as being divided into three areas of responsibility, called "[[Three pillars of the European Union|pillars]]". The original European Community policies form the first pillar, while the second consists of [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]]. The third pillar originally consisted of [[Justice and Home Affairs]], however owing to changes introduced by the Amsterdam and Nice treaties, it currently only consists of [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]]. Broadly speaking, the second and third pillars can be described as the intergovernmental pillars because the supranational institutions of the Commission, Parliament and the Court of Justice play less of a role or none at all, while the lead is taken by the intergovernmental Council (of ministers) and the European Council. Most activities of the EU come under the first, Community pillar. This is mostly economically orientated and the supranational institutions have more influence.<ref name="Glossary Pillars">{{cite web |title=Pillars of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/eu_pillars_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> 

Two major political issues for the EU are [[European integration]] and [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. Enlargement, the accession of new states to the EU, is a highly politicised issue. Supporters argue it aids democracy in new members, as well as supporting the European economy as a whole. Opponents fear the EU is expanding beyond its current political capabilities, and/or cultural boundaries. Public opinion, and hence political party viewpoint, has been more sceptical towards enlargement since the simultaneous accession of 10 members in 2004. This is most acute in relation to the [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|candidacy of Turkey]].<ref name="IHT fatigue">{{cite web|last=Smale|first=Alison|authorlink=|last2=Bilefsky|first2=Dan|coauthors=|title=Fighting EU 'enlargement fatigue'|work=|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2006-06-19]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/19/news/eu.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref><ref name="Enlargement voice">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU enlargement - voices from the debate|work=|publisher=British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|date=|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1139992114487|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref><ref name=";BBC Turkey">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Q&A: Turkey's EU entry talks|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2006-12-11]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4107919.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

Integration is another political issue, where the public view is sometimes that national interest conflicts with that of the EU. The aim of increasing harmonisation between states has meant that national powers have been transferred to the European level. This is criticised by [[eurosceptics]] who fear the loss of national [[sovereignty]].<ref name="Anti-EU">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=FAQs on the EU, from the campaign trail|work=|publisher=Sovereignty|date=2001|url=http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/campquest.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> In 2004 the [[European Constitution]] was agreed between national leaders and the EU institutions. However it did not come into force after it was rejected in referenda in two countries, with the prospect of further rejections had attempts at ratification continued. In October 2007 European leaders finalised a new [[Treaty of Lisbon]] which contains much of the now defunct constitution, without the latter's constitutional baggage. 

It is expected to come into force in 2009. If ratified the treaty will introduce more majority voting in the Council and increase the powers of the European Parliament. The treaty also proposes to abolish the EU's pillar system. More aspects of foreign policy will now be subject to the supranational, as opposed to intergovernmental, institutions.<ref name="BBC Reform">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU leaders agree on reform treaty|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6232540.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24522|title=EU unveils bulky new treaty draft|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-07-09]]|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref>

==Legal system==

[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|The [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg]]]]

The EU is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sources of EU law |url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> The treaties lay down the broad policy goals of the organisation and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals.

In the case of a conflict where a law stemming from EU legislation conflicts with another national law, the EU law is considered to take precedence (principle of '[[European Union law#Supremacy|Supremacy]]').<ref name="Supremacy">According to the principle of [[European Union law#Supremacy|Supremacy]] as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v.

Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; ''Raoul George Nicolo'' [1990] 1 CMLR 173.</ref> Decisions regarding EU legislation may be appealed to the [[European Court of Justice]].

===Legislation===
Although the Treaties are the ultimate source of EU Law, there are a number of legislative instruments available to the EU institutions. The three main instruments are [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulations]], [[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] and [[European Union decision|Decisions]]. There is no formal hierarchy regarding the three types.

'''Regulations''' are legislative acts which become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures to have been taken by member states.<ref>See: Case 34/73, ''Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze'' [1973] ECR 981</ref> Once in force their contents automatically override conflicting domestic provisions, as a result of having [[direct effect]] in the national law of the member states.<ref name="art249"/>

'''Directives''' require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result within a certain time period. Directives are generally utilised where it is thought preferable to leave the precise details of legislative implementation to national governments.<ref>To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 27 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115</ref> Once the stated time period has passed, under certain conditions provisions within a Directive may have [[direct effect]] in national law against Member States.

'''Decisions''' offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. The Council and the Commission may publish in the official journal a decision, notified to a particular addressee, such as an individual trader or a company. Decisions will be found most commonly in [[European Community competition law|Competition Law]], or on rulings on [[State Aid]], and can be challenged by the addressee under certain circumstances before the [[European Court of Justice|EU courts]].

The EU's legal system contains a multiplicity of legislative procedures used to enact the above legislation. The treaties provide the basis for all legislation and lay down the different ways of adopting legislation for different policy areas.<ref>For a good example of this see Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty of Rome, Council Decision (2004/927/EC) of 22 December 2004 providing for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty and the Protocol on Article 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Community attached to the Nice Treaty.</ref> A common feature of the EU's legislative procedures, however, is that almost all legislation must be proposed by the Commission, rather than member states or European parliamentarians.<ref>{{cite web |title=Decision-making in the European Union |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-09-14}}. See: [[European Union legislative procedure]].</ref> The two most common procedures are co-decision, under which the European Parliament can veto proposed legislation, and consultation, under which Parliament is only permitted to give an opinion which can, subsequently, be ignored by European leaders.

===Courts===
The judicial branch of the EU consists of the [[European Court of Justice]] and the [[Court of First Instance]] (to be renamed the "General Court" upon the entering into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]). Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU.<ref>Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome.</ref> The Court of First Instance mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts. While the Court of Justice deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions and cases referred to the EU's courts by the courts of member states.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Court of Justice of the European Communities |url=http://www.curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/cje.htm |accessdate=2007-09-14}};{{cite web |title=The Court of First Instance |url=http://www.curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/tpi.htm |accessdate=2007-09-14}}; {{cite web |title=Institutions: Court of Justice |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/justice/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> Decisions from the Court of First Instance can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.<ref>Article 225(1) of the Treaty of Rome.</ref> 

National courts within the Member States also play a key role in the EU as enforcers of EU law, and a "spirit of cooperation" between EU and national courts is laid down in the Treaties. National courts can apply EU law in domestic cases, and if they require clarification on the interpretation or validity of any EU legislation related to the case it may make a reference for a preliminary ruling to the ECJ. The right to declare EU legislation invalid however is reserved to the EU courts.

==Justice, freedom and security==
{{see|Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom & Security}}
[[Image:SchengenGrenzeBayern-Tirol.jpg|thumb|150px|The Schengen Agreement has opened borders between most member states]]

Much of the EU's competence in the justice and home affairs area originates from the signing of the [[Schengen Agreement]] in 1985 on gradual abolition of border controls between six, of the then ten, European Community member states. In order to implement the Schengen Agreement, the signatory states included measures designed to compensate for effect of the reduced border controls in the areas of [[right of asylum|asylum]], immigration and criminal justice.<ref name="EC Schengen">{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33020.htm |title=The Schengen ''acquis'' and its integration into the Union |accessdate=2007-09-01 |publisher=The European Commission }}</ref> The Maastricht Treaty transferred the Schengen [[acquis]] to the EU.<ref name="Maastricht IV">By Title IV of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] as originally enacted</ref> Additional competencies were assigned to the EU by the Maastricht Treaty to facilitate the freedom of movement of people by adopting common rules in civil matters, such as contract and family law.<ref name="Maastricht IV"/> The Maastricht Treaty also introduced with concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]], which is complementary to national citizenship.<ref>[http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html Treaty of Rome (as amended)], Article 17</ref>

Amendments to these treaties by the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] added a new aim of the EU as the creation of an "area of Justice, Freedom and Security".<ref>By Article 1(3) of the Amsterdam Treaty.</ref> That treaty also made it easier to pass laws in the justice and home affairs area and more difficult for member states to veto them. It also increased the powers of the European Parliament in relation to Justice and Home affairs' measures.<ref>Decisions in certain matters coming to be decided by [[codecision|co-decision]].</ref> Recent legislation include the [[European Arrest Warrant]]<ref>{{cite web |title=European arrest warrant replaces extradition between EU Member States |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm |publisher=The European Commission |accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> and directives on family law.<ref>Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility.</ref>

===Fundamental rights===
The EU has developed a role in [[human rights]] protection. Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.<ref>Article 39 and 114 of the Treaty of Rome on nationality and sexual discrimination respectively.</ref> The Amsterdam Treaty supplemented these, by supporting further legislation against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age and sexual orientation.<ref>By Article 2(7) of the Amsterdam Treaty, amending Article 13 of the Treaty of Rome.</ref> Using these powers the EU has enacted legislation on [[sexual discrimination]] in the work-place, [[age discrimination]] and [[racial discrimination]].<ref>Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16–22).</ref> All EU states have abolished the [[death penalty]] for all crimes and the EU has been a prominent campaigner for global abolition.<ref name="DP">{{cite web|title=Launching the European Day against the Death Penalty|date=[[2007-06-19]]|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/850|accessdate = 2007-11-12 }}</ref>

Signing the 1950 [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership, however the institutions of the EU are not covered by this. As the EU was not capable of signing the ECHR without a treaty change, the EU drew up the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]]. The charter consolidated not only the rights of the ECHR but from other UN and EU agreements, covering economic, political and social rights including "third generation" rights such as good governance and a clean environment. Although it was proclaimed in 2000, it has no legal force at present (2007).<ref name="Justice CFR">{{cite web|title =EU Charter of Fundamental Rights FAQ|publisher=Justice|url=http://www.eucharter.org/home.php?page_id=66|accessdate = 2007-11-12 }}</ref> Under the Reform Treaty, the Charter would become legally binding and the EU would accede to the ECHR,<ref name="BBC Lisbon Q&A">{{cite web|title=Q&A: The Lisbon Treaty|date=[[2007-10-19]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6901353.stm|accessdate = 2007-11-12 }}</ref> which would make the [[European Court of Human Rights]], currently totally separate from the EU, the highest court in the EU for Human Rights, above the EU's Court of Justice. Even without joining, the Court of Justice and Court of Human Rights co-operate to ensure their case-law does not conflict, thus the Court of Justice already treats the ECHR as though it was part of EU law.<ref name="Juncker Council">{{cite web|last=Juncker|first=Jean-Claude|authorlink=Jean-Claude Juncker|title =Council of Europe - European Union: "A sole ambition for the European continent"|date=2006|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Sessions/2006/speeches/20060411_report_JCJuncker_EN.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-07-28 }}</ref>

{{see|Foreign relations of the European Union|Common Foreign and Security Policy}}
[[Image:Javier Solana (2007).jpg|thumb|The [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative]], [[Javier Solana]], is the EU's spokesperson on foreign policy.]]

The foreign relations of the EU are primarily dealt with through the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Co-operation in international trade negotiations, under the Common Commercial Policy, dates back to the establishment of the Community in 1957.<ref>{{cite web |title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy |url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-09-03 |publisher=The European commission}}</ref> The CFSP itself has its origins in the formation of [[European Political Cooperation|European Political Co-operation]] in 1970.<ref name="EPC">{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |title=European political co-operation (EPC) |accessdate=2007-09-03 |publisher=The European commission |work= Europa Glossary }}</ref> European Political Co-operation was an informal consultation process between member states on foreign policy matters, with the aim of forming common policies. It was formally introduced into the then European Community by the [[Single European Act]] and subsequently renamed as the "Common Foreign and Security Policy" by the Maastricht Treaty.<ref name="EPC"/>

The Maastricht Treaty gives the Common Foreign and Security Policy the aims of promoting both the EU's own interests and those of the [[international community]] as a whole. This includes promoting international co-operation, respect for [[human rights]], [[democracy]] and the [[rule of law]].<ref>By Article 11 of the Maastricht Treaty.</ref>

The Amsterdam Treaty created the office of the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (currently held by [[Javier Solana]]) to co-ordinate the EU's foreign policy.<ref name="Europa CFSP">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) - Overview|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=2002|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/intro/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> The High Representative, in conjunction with the current [[Presidency of the European Union|Presidency]], speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy matters and can have the task of articulating ambiguous policy positions created by disagreements among member states.

The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP makes disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq,<ref name="BBC Iraq statement">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Divided EU agrees Iraq statement|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2697667.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> not uncommon.

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through the [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered a major factor contributing to the reform of former Communist countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name="Enlargement voice"/> This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as "soft power", as opposed to military "hard power".<ref name="Soft Power">{{cite web|last=Bildt|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Bildt|coauthors=|title=Europe must keep its 'soft power'|work=|publisher=[[Financial Times]] on [[Centre for European Reform]]|date=2005|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/bildt_ft_1june05.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> [[Finnish Prime Minister]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], cited the common foreign policy as a factor why [[Finland]] is, de facto, no longer a [[neutral country]].

Besides the CFSP, the Commission is also has its own representation in international organisations, its representation in international bodies is primarily through the [[European Commissioner for External Relations]], who works along side the High Representative.

===Humanitarian aid===
{{see|ECHO (European Commission)}}
[[Image:ECHO plane.jpg|thumb|The EU is the largest contributor of aid in the world.]]

The [[ECHO (European Commission)|European Community humanitarian aid office]], or "ECHO", provides [[humanitarian aid]] from the EU to developing countries. In 2006 its budget amounted to 671 million euro, 48% of which went to the [[ACP countries]].<ref name="ECHO 2006">{{cite web |coauthors=|title=DG for humanitarian aid - ECHO, financial report 2006 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]] |date=2006 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/echo/pdf_files/financial_report.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> Counting the EU's own contributions and those of its member states together, the EU is the largest aid donor in the world.<ref name="Aid Consensus">{{cite web |title=Commission calls for a European consensus to boost impact of humanitarian aid |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]] |date=[[2007-06-13]] |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/814&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

The EU's aid has previously been criticised by the think-tank [[Open Europe]] for being inefficient, mis-targeted and linked to economic objectives.<ref name="BBC Aid Inefficient">{{cite web|last=Mulvey|first=Stephen |title=EU attacked for 'inefficient' aid |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2007-05-30]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6705773.stm |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> 
Furthermore, some charities have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees.

===Military and defence===
{{main|European Security and Defence Policy|Military of the European Union}}

Member states are responsible for their own territorial defence. Many EU members are also members of [[NATO]]. The [[Western European Union]] (WEU) is a European security organisation related to the EU. In 1992, the WEU's relationship with the EU was defined, when the EU assigned it the "[[Petersberg tasks]]" (humanitarian missions such as peacekeeping and crisis management). These tasks were later transferred from the WEU to the EU by the Amsterdam Treaty; they formed part of the new CFSP and the [[European Security and Defence Policy]]. Elements of the WEU are currently being merged into the EU's CFSP, and the President of the WEU is currently CFSP High Representative.<ref name="Europa ESDP">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU Security Police & the role of the European Commission|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/esdp/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref><ref name="Europa Chronology">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU Security Police & the role of the European Commission: Chronology|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/esdp/chrono.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

Following the [[Kosovo war]] in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO." To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the [[Helsinki Headline Goal]] process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the [[EU Battlegroups]] initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 men each.<ref name="Council Capabilities">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Military Capabilities|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=1349&lang=EN|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> EU forces have been deployed on [[peacekeeping]] missions from [[Africa]] to the former [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[middle east]].<ref name="Council Operations">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU Operations|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=268&lang=EN&mode=g|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the [[European Defence Agency]], [[European Union Satellite Centre|satellite centre]] and the [[European Union Military Staff|military staff]].<ref name="Council Structures">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=ESPD Structures|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=279&lang=EN&mode=g|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>{{-}}

The EU was originally created as an economic union. The oldest and largest constituent organisation, the European Community, was founded as the European Economic Community. Creating and maintaining the EU's [[single market]] has been a prominent goal of the Community since its inception in 1993. It seeks to guarantee [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|four freedoms]]: these relate to ensuring the free movement of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] around the EU's internal market as well as the flow of [[Citizenship of the European Union|people]] within the area.<ref name="Europa Single Market">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Single Market|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> The freedoms are extended to the non-member states of [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]] via the [[European Economic Area]].<ref name="EEA">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/eea/index.htm| title =The European Economic Area (EEA)|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|accessdate = 2007-07-21}}</ref>

The principle of free movement of goods ensures produce can be taken anywhere within the whole market to be sold, though with exceptions for anything which might pose a public health risk. Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.<ref name="Europa Single Market G">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A Single Market for goods|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Services account for between sixty and seventy percent of GDP, although legislation permitting  free movement is not as established as in other sectors.

===Monetary union===
{{see|Euro|Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union}}
[[Image:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|The [[euro]] is used in [[eurozone|15 EU countries]].]] 

A [[single currency]] for the EU has been an official objective since 1969 and work began in 1990 on [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]. Nine years later the [[euro]] was [[Introduction of the euro|launched in eleven]] of the then fifteen member states as an accounting currency, meaning that national currencies remained in use but with exchange rates locked to the euro.  On January 1, 2002, euro notes and coins were issued and the national currencies were phased out. Membership increased to twelve in 2002 and now thirteen countries belong to the [[Eurozone]] using the euro as their sole official currency. All other  EU members except Denmark and the United Kingdom have agreed to join as a condition of being members of the EU. [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]] will adopt the euro in 2008 and dates for others will be set when economic conditions have been met. Public opinion in Denmark currently favours joining, but Sweden has pointedly failed to take necessary economic steps. There are [[Euro#Future prospects (2008–)|fourteen other currencies]] used in the EU.<ref name="euro website">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/our_currency_en.htm| title=The Euro: our currency | publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |work=The Euro: Our Currency |accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref> A number of other countries outside the EU, such as [[Montenegro]], also use the euro unofficially.<ref name="euro use world">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/world/euro_world_main_en.htm| title=The use of the euro in the world | publisher=European Commission |work=The Euro: Our Currency |accessdate = 2007-09-15}}</ref> The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it, are under the control of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html |title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem |publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|accessdate = 2007-09-15}}</ref> 

The euro is designed to help build the single market by, for example: easing travel of citizens and goods, eliminating exchange rate problems, providing price transparency, creating a single financial market, price stability, low interest rates, having a currency used internationally and protecting against shocks due to the large amount of internal trade within the eurozone. It is also intended as a political symbol of integration and stimulus for further integration.<ref name="euro website"/> In recent years [[Foreign exchange reserves|holdings]] of the euro have grown, and there is some speculation that if the eurozone continues to enlarge, or the [[US Dollar]] continues to fall, the euro possibly could become the main [[reserve currency]] in the world.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Menzie |first= Chinn |coauthors= Jeffery Frankel |year= 2006 |month= January |title= Will the Euro Eventually Surpass The Dollar As Leading International Reserve Currency? |journal=[[NBER]] |url=http://www.wage.wisc.edu/uploads/Working%20Papers/chinnfrankel_NBER_eurotopcurrency.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 2007-10-11 }}</ref>

===Competition===
{{see|European Community competition law|European Commissioner for Competition}}
The EU operates a [[competition policy]] aimed at furthering its aim of ensuring undistorted competition within the single market.<ref>Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome</ref> The Commission as the [[competition regulator]] for the single market is responsible for [[antitrust]] issues, approving [[mergers]], breaking up [[cartels]], working for [[economic liberalisation]] and preventing [[state aid]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|title=Competition: making markets work better|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/index_en.html|accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref>

The [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition Commissioner]], currently [[Neelie Kroes]], is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission, notable in effecting trans-national corporations.<ref>{{cite web|last =Lungescu|first=Oana|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title =Examining the EU executive|date=[[2004-07-23]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/3921303.stm|accessdate = 2007-09-18}}</ref> For example, in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented the merger between between two companies who were both based in the [[United States]] and had approval from their national authority.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|title =The Commission prohibits GE's acquisition of Honeywell|date=[[2001-07-03]]|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/01/939|accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref> A further recent high profile case, [[European Union v.

However in negotiations on the Treaty of Lisbon, [[President of France|French President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] succeeded in removing words "free and undistorted competition" from the treaties. However as the requirement is maintained in an annex, it is  unclear whether this would have any practical effect on EU policy.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title =EU competition to remain in place|date=[[2007-06-22]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6231684.stm|accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref>

==Development policy==
===Agriculture===
{{main|Common Agricultural Policy}}

The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) is one the oldest policies of the European Community and was one of its core aims.<ref name="stead">{{cite web|last=Stead|first=David|authorlink=|coauthors=Robert Whaples (eds)|title=Common Agricultural Policy|work=|publisher=EH.Net Encyclopedia|date=[[2007-06-22]]|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Stead.CAP |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers. (article 33 of the Treaty of Rome).<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s the policy accounted for over 60% of the then European Communities' annual budget, and still accounts for around 35%.<ref name="stead"/>

[[Image:ClosLaPlanaEdit.jpg|thumb|left|EU farms are supported by the [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]], the largest [[EU budget|budgetary]] expenditure (Vinyard in Spain).]]

The policy's price controls and market interventions led to a great deal of overproduction resulting in so-called ''butter mountains'' and ''wine lakes''. These were intervention stores which were built up from produce bought by the Community to ensure minimum price levels. In order to reduce the levels of these stores, agricultural produce was often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their produce outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers in the developing world.<ref name="Guardian CAP">{{cite web|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The EU common agricultural policy|work=|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-06-26]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theissues/article/0,,975350,00.html |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The overproduction has also been criticised on environmental grounds in that it encourages environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/> Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living, in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life. However currently the EU's small farmers only receive 8% of CAP's available subsidies.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/>

Since the beginning of the 1990s CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially these reforms included the introduction of milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). It is intended to move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to have the effect of allowing the market to dictate production levels while maintaining agricultural income levels.<ref name="stead"/> The most recent reform entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime which previously involved the carving up of the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.<ref name="EC CAP">{{cite web |title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |date=[[2007-04-14]] |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>

===Energy===
{{main|Energy policy of the European Union}}
[[Image:RF NG pipestoEU.gif|thumb|Many EU member states import oil and gas from Russia.]]

The EU has been a legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence. This involvement has its roots in the original [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] in October 2005. The first draft policy was published in January 2007.<ref name="Energy Q&A">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Q&A: EU energy plans|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-03-09]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4783996.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

The Commission has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between [[electricity grid]]s; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in [[Central Asia]] and [[North Africa]]; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing use of renewable energy; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.<ref name="Energy Q&A"/>

The EU currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], making it the world's leading importer of these fuels.<ref name="low carb prop">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title='Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe|work=|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> There are concerns that the EU is largely dependent on other countries, primarily [[Russia]] for its energy. This concern has grown following a series of [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute|clashes]] between Russia and its neighbours, threatening the flow of gas. As a result the EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply.<ref name="Energy Russia">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Ukraine-Russia gas dispute - call for stronger EU energy policy|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/051-4234-012-01-02-909-20060112STO04233-2006-12-01-2006/default_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
{{see|European Commissioner for Transport|European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry}}<!--Galileo comes under the latter, not Transport-->
The EU is working to improve cross-border [[infrastructure]] within the EU, for example through the [[Trans-European Networks]] (TEN). Projects under TEN include the [[Channel Tunnel]], [[TGV Est]], the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]], the [[Oresund bridge]] and the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]]. In 2001 it was estimated that by 2010 the network would cover: 75,200&nbsp;km of roads; 78,000&nbsp;km of railways; 330 airports; 270 maritime harbours; and 210 internal harbours.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=[[2003-10-01]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ten/transport/revision/doc/revision_1692_memo_en.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mirea|first=Silvia|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|work=|publisher=The Railway Journal|date=|url=http://www.cfr.ro/jf/engleza/0304/ten-t.htm|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

[[Image:Öresundsbrons vajrar 2.jpg|thumb|left|Infrastructure, such as the [[Oresund bridge]] between Denmark and Sweden, is a priority to increase trade and mobility.]]

The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=White Paper on Transport|work=|publisher=Euractiv|date=[[2004-09-22]]|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/white-paper-transport/article-129628|format=|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> The [[Roads and expressways in Poland|Polish road network]] in particular was in poor condition.

Another infrastructure project is the [[Galileo positioning system]]. Galileo is a proposed [[Global Navigation Satellite System]], to be built by the EU and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).

[[Image:Windkraftanlagen_Dänemark_gross.jpg|thumb|[[Renewable energy]] is one priority in transnational research activities such as the [[Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)|(FP7)]].]]
Education and science are areas where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In education, the policy was mainly developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[ERASMUS programme]], a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th anniversary |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}; {{cite web|last=Jean-Sébastien|first=Lefebvre |title=Erasmus turns 20 - time to grow up? |date=[[2007-01-22]]|publisher=Café Babel |url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=9702 |accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref> There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013]]. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.<ref>{{cite web |title=Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm |accessdate=2007-07-21}}; {{cite web |title=Lifelong Learning Programme |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> Through its support of the [[Bologna process]] the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.

Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent [[European Research Council]] allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.<ref>{{cite web |title=European Research Council: What is the ERC? |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&topicID=12 |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The [[Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)]] deals in a number of areas, for example energy where it aims to develop a diverse mix of [[renewable energy]] for the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Energy|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm?pg=energy |accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref>

Since January 2000 the [[European Commission]] has set its sights on a more ambitious objective, known as the [[European Research Area]]; extensively funding research in a few key research areas. This has the support of all member states, and extends the existing financing structure of the frameworks. It aims to focus on co-ordination, sharing knowledge, ensuring mobility of researchers around Europe, improving conditions for researchers and encouraging links with business and industry as well as removing any legal and administrative barriers.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the European Research Area? |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The EU is involved with six other countries to develop [[ITER]], a [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] [[nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] which will be built in the EU at [[Cadarache]].

Findings by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency which monitors the religious beliefs of EU citizens as part of its [[Eurobarometer]] opinion polls, show that the majority of EU citizens have some form of belief system but that only 21% see it as important. There is increasing [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]] among the general population in Europe, with falling attendance and membership in many countries.<ref name="About SecE">{{cite web|last=Cline|first=Austin|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Secularism in Europe|work=|publisher=About.com|date=[[2005-02-28]]|url=http://atheism.about.com/b/a/149439.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The 2005 Eurobarometer show that of the European citizens (of the 25 members at that time), 52% believe in ''a'' god, 27% in ''some sort of spirit or life force'' and 18% had no form of belief.

===Geography===
{{main|Geography of the European Union}}
[[Image:Mont Blanc depuis la gare des glaciers.jpg|thumb|The [[Mont Blanc]] in the [[Alps]] is the highest peak in the EU]]
The EU's member states cover a combined area of {{convert|4422773|sqkm|sqmi|0}}.<ref name="Area.and.population.figure">Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the EU, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the EU.</ref> The total territory of the EU is the [[List of countries by area|seventh largest territory in the world by area]] and its highest peak is [[Mont Blanc]] in the [[Alps]] at 4807 metres above sea level. The landscape, climate and economy of the EU are heavily influenced by its long coastline, which is {{convert|65993|km|mi|0}} long. The EU has the second longest coastline, after [[Canada]]. The combined member states share [[countries bordering the European Union|land borders]] with 21 non-member states for a total of {{convert|12441|km|mi|0}}, the fifth longest border in the world.<ref name="Europa Members">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European countries|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2007|url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref><ref name="CIA">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Union|work=|publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|date=2007|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ee.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref><ref name="Longest coasts">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Countries of the Earth|work=|publisher=home.comcast.net|date=2006|url=http://home.comcast.net/~igpl/Countries.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-08}}<!--If anyone has a more academic source, please replace this--></ref>

When the overseas territories of member states are included, the EU includes most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] to [[Tropical climate|tropical]], rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. In practice, the majority of the population lives either in areas with a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Southern Europe), a temperate [[maritime climate]] (Western Europe), or a warm summer continental or [[hemiboreal]] climate (Eastern Europe).<ref name="Humid Continental climate">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Humid Continental Climate|work=|publisher=University of Wisconsin|date=2007|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

{{see|Culture of Europe|Cultural policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:800px-Sb-kl-ring.jpg|thumb|[[Sibiu]] is one of the two [[European Capital of Culture|European Capitals of Culture]] for 2007.]]
EU culture is intertwined with the [[culture of Europe]] and its specific national heritage; many of the policies on culture are with the individual member states. 
Cultural co-operation between member states has become a community competency since its inclusion in the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref name="Bozoki">{{cite web|last=Bozoki|first=Andras |title=Cultural Policy and Politics in the European Union |url=http://137.204.115.130/activities/download/Bozoki/Cultural%20Policy%20and%20Politics%20in%20the%20European%20Union.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme,<ref name="Bozoki"/> the [[European Cultural Month]] event,<ref name="Culture Month">{{cite web |title=European Culture Month |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_eu_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> the [[Media Plus]] programme,<ref name="Media Plus">{{cite web |title=Media programme |publisher=Philatelism.com |date=[[2007-07-05]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/media/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> orchestras such as the [[European Union Youth Orchestra]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euyo.org.uk/about/history.htm |title=An Overture to the European Union Youth Orchestra |publisher=The European Youth Orchestra |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> and the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme – where one or more cities in the EU are selected for one year to assist the cultural development of the city.<ref name="Capital Culture">{{cite web|last=Bozoki|first=Andras|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Capitals of Culture|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_eu_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> In addition, the EU gives grants to cultural projects (totalling 233 in 2004) and has launched a Web portal dedicated to Europe and culture, responding to the European Council's expressed desire to see the Commission and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means."<ref name="Culture Portal">{{cite web |title=Cultural heritage as a vehicle of cultural identity |publisher=philatelism.com |date=[[2007-07-05]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/portal/activities/heritage/cultural_heritage_vehic_en.htm |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Within the EU, supporters of [[European integration]] often appeal to a shared European historical/cultural heritage, typically including [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], the [[feudalism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], 19th century [[Liberalism]] and (sometimes) negative elements such as the [[World Wars]]. European values are assumed to be grounded in this shared heritage.<ref>For example: {{cite web | url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-3007-043-02-07-901-20070208IPR02888-12-02-2007-2007-true/default_en.htm | title =Priority is dialogue for partnership and tolerance | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | author = Hans-Gert Poettering| authorlink = Hans-Gert Pöttering| date = 2007-02-13 | work = Inaugural speech by the new president of the European Parliament | publisher = European Parliament | quote = }}</ref>. Another way to sum up this spreaded vision of unity is the quote : "Europeans have different cultures but the same approach of culture". 

===Sport===
{{see|Sport in Europe|Sport policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:Campnoumatch.jpg|thumb|Spectator sports are popular in many EU member states ([[Camp Nou]], [[Barcelona]])]]

Sport is mainly the responsibility of individual states or other international organisations rather than that of the EU. However, some EU policies have had an impact on sport, such as the freedom of employment which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]], which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.<ref name="BBC Boseman">{{cite web|last=Fordyce|first=Tom|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=10 years since Bosman|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Under the proposed [[Treaty of Lisbon]] sports would be given a special status which would exempt this sector from much of the EU's economic rules. This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[FIFA]], due to objections over the applications of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.<ref name="IHT RT">{{cite web|title=IOC, FIFA presidents welcomes new EU treaty, call it breakthrough to give sports more power|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2007-10-19]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/19/sports/EU-SPT-OLY-EU-Treaty.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> 

Several European sports associations are consulted in the formulation of the EU's sports policy, including [[FIBA]], [[UEFA]], [[European Handball Federation|EHF]], [[IIHF]], [[FIRA - Association of European Rugby|FIRA]] and [[Confédération Européenne de Volleyball|CEV]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement of European team sports|publisher=UEFA.com|date=[[2007-10-19]]|url=http://www.uefa.com/multimediafiles/download/uefa/keytopics/560675_download.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> All EU member states and their respective national sport associations are participating in European sport organizations such as [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA|publisher=UEFA.com|date=[[2007-10-19]]|url=http://www.uefa.com/|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref>
