In November 2003, Spears released her fourth studio album, 
''[[In the Zone]]'', jettisoning the [[Max Martin]]-produced [[synthpop]] of her earlier releases. The album took in lesser-known producers such as [[Christopher Stewart (music producer)|RedZone]] and big names including [[Moby]] and [[R. Kelly]]. Spears co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs and co-produced several pieces of her material for the first time. ''In the Zone'' topped the U.S. charts in its debut week, selling over 609,000 copies. This made Spears the only female in music history to have her first four studio albums debut at number one.<ref name=inthezonestats>{{cite web | author=''Yahoo!
