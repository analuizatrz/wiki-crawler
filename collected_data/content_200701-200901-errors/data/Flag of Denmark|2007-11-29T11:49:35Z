[[Image:Dannebrog.jpg|thumb|250px|The Dannebrog in flight.]]
The national '''flag of [[Denmark]]''', the '''''Dannebrog''''', is red with a white [[Nordic Cross Flag|Scandinavian cross]] that extends to the edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side. The cross design of the Danish [[flag]] was subsequently adopted by the other [[Nordic countries]]: [[Flag of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Flag of Norway|Norway]], [[Flag of Finland|Finland]], and [[Flag of Iceland|Iceland]]. During the [[Denmark-Norway|Danish-Norwegian]] personal union, the Dannebrog was also the flag of Norway and continued to be, with slight modifications, until Norway adopted [[Flag of Norway|its current flag]] in 1821.

The Dannebrog is the oldest [[state flag]] in the world still in use<!--Scotland and Catalonia aren't recognized as independent nations. If they were, Catalonia's flag has the oldest preserved flag-->, with the earliest undisputed source dating back to the 14th century. Prior to the use of the Dannebrog, Danish forces were known to have used the [[raven banner]].

==The legendary origin of the flag==
The legend of the flag is very popular among Danes, although most consider it to be a [[Mythology|myth]], albeit a beautiful one. The legend says that during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]], also known as the Battle of Valdemar (Danish: "''Volmerslaget''"), near [[Lyndanisse]] (Tallinn) in [[Estonia]], on [[15 June|June 15]] [[1219]], the flag fell from the sky during a critical stage, resulting in Danish victory.

[[Image:Danmarks flag 1219 Lorentzen.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Dannebrog falling from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]], [[June 15]], [[1219]]. Painted by [[Christian August Lorentzen]] in [[1809]]. Original located at [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], Denmark]]

No historical record supports this legend. The first record of the legend dates from more than 300 years after the campaign, and the first record connects the legend to a much smaller battle, though still in Estonia; the battle of Fellin ([[Viljandi]]) in [[1208]]. Though no historical support exists for the flag story in the Fellin battle either, it is not difficult to understand how a small and unknown place is replaced with the much grander battle of Reval from the Estonia campaign of King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]].

This story originates from two written sources from the early [[16th century]].

The first is found in [[Christiern Pedersen]]'s "''Danske Krønike''", which is a sequel to [[Saxo]]’s [[Gesta Danorum]], written [[1520]] – [[1523|23]]. It is not mentioned in connection to the campaign of King Valdemar II in Estonia, but in connection with a campaign in [[Russia]]. He also mentions that this flag, falling from the sky during the Russian campaign of King Valdemar II, is the very same flag that King [[Eric of Pomerania]] took with him when he left the country in [[1440]] after being deposed as King.

The second source is the writing of the Franciscan monk [[Petrus Olai]] (Peder Olsen) of [[Roskilde]], from [[1527]]. This record describes a battle in [[1208]] near a place called "''Felin''" during the Estonia campaign of King Valdemar II. The Danes were all but defeated when a lamb-skin banner depicting a white cross falls from the sky and miraculously leads to a Danish victory. In another record by ''Petrus Olai'' called "''Danmarks Tolv Herligheder''" (Twelve Splendours of Denmark), in splendour number nine, the same story is re-told almost to the word, however a paragraph has been inserted correcting the year to 1219.

Whether or not these records describe a truly old oral story in existence at that time, or a [[16th century]] invented story, is not currently determined.

Some historians believe that the story by ''Petrus Olai'' refers to a source from the first half of the [[15th century]], making this the oldest reference to the falling flag.

==The continuation of the romantic legend==
The story of the original flag has a continuation.

According to tradition, the original flag from the Battle of Lyndanisse was used in the small campaign of [[1500]] when [[John of Denmark|King Hans]] tried to conquer [[Dithmarschen]] (in western [[Holstein]] in north [[Germany]]). The flag was lost in a devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Hemmingstedt]] on [[February 17|17 February]] 1500. In [[1559]], King [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederik II]] recaptured it during his own [[Dithmarschen]] campaign. In the capitulation terms it is stated that all Danish banners lost in 1500 were to be returned.

[[Image:Hans Kniepers 1585.jpg|thumb|200px|left|One of [[Hans Knieper]]’s heroic paintings of Danish kings from [[1585]]. King [[Eric VI of Denmark|Erik Menved]] storming a castle. Note the two Danish flags. Original located at [[Kronborg|Kronborg Castle]].]]

This legend is found in two sources, [[Hans Svaning]]'s ''History of King John'' from [[1558]]-[[1559]] and [[Johan Rantzau]]'s ''History about the Last [[Dithmarschen]] War'', from [[1569]].
Both claim that this was the original flag, and consequently both writers knew the legend of the falling flag. In [[1576]], the son of ''Johan Rantzau'', [[Henrik Rantzau]], also writes about the war and the fate of the flag. He notes that the flag was in a poor condition when returned.

Sources from [[Dithmarschen]], written shortly after the battle of [[1500]], do mention banners, including the Royal banner, being captured from the Danes, but there is no mention of ''Dannebrog'' or the "original" flag.
It is quite plausible that the king’s personal banner as well as the leading banner of the army were both lost, as the battle was led by the King himself. However, it is more questionable if he indeed was carrying the "original" flag.

In a letter dated [[February 22|22 February]] [[1500]] to [[Oluf Stigsøn]], King John describes the battle, but does not mention the loss of an important flag. In fact, the entire letter gives the impression that the lost battle was nothing more than an "unfortunate affair".

An indication that we are dealing with multiple flags, are the [[1570]] writings of [[Niels Hemmingsøn]] regarding a bloody battle between Danes and Swedes near the Swedish town of [[Uppsala]] in [[1520]]. He writes that the "Danish head banner" ("''Danmarckis Hoffuitbanner''") was nearly captured by the Swedes. It was saved only by the combined efforts of the banner-carrier [[Mogens Gyldenstierne]], taking multiple wounds, and a young man coming to his rescue. This young man was [[Peder Skram]]. This "''Danmarckis Hoffuitbanner''" was probably nothing short of the "''Banner of the Realm'" (''Rigsbanner''), the ''Dannebrog''.

This is however not the end of the story. A priest and historian from [[Dithmarschen]], [[Neocorus]], wrote in [[1598]] that the banner captured in [[1500]], was brought to the church in [[Wohrden]] and hung there for the next 59 years, until it was returned to the Danes as part of the peace settlement in [[1559]].
[[Henrik Rantzau]] states in his writing of [[1576]] that the flag was brought to [[City of Schleswig|Slesvig city]] and placed in the cathedral, following its return.

A historian from [[Schleswig|Slesvig]], [[Ulrik Petersen]] (1656-1735), wrote in the late [[17th century]] that the flag hung in ''Slesvig'' cathedral till about [[1660]] until it simply crumbled away, thus ending its more than 400-year-old story.

Historically, it is of course impossible to prove or disprove that these records speak of the same flag. If the flag of 1208 or 1219 ever existed. Many of these legends are apparently built on earlier ones.

==Other theories of the origin of the flag==
Other origin theories have been put forth in the late 19th and early 20th century.

[[Image:Saxo Chr P front version 002.png|thumb|250px|right|The Danish flag from the front page of [[Christiern Pedersen]]’s version of [[Saxo]]’s [[Gesta Danorum]], [[1514]]. Full frontpage can be seen [[:Image:Saxo Chr P front version 001.jpg|here]].]]

===Theories of the origin of the flag, #2===
The Danish historian [[Caspar Paludan-Müller]] in [[1873]] in his book "''Sagnet om den himmelfaldne Danebrogsfane''" put forth the theory that it is a banner sent by the [[Pope]] to the Danish King to use in his crusades in the [[Baltic countries]]. Other kings and lords certainly received such banners.

One would though imagine that if this story was true, some kind of record ought to exist of the event and presumably Danish historians would not have failed to mention it in some way. Being granted a banner by the Pope would have been a great honour, but despite the many letters of the popes relating to the [[crusades]], none of them mentions granting a banner to a King of Denmark. On the other hand, the letter in question might simply have been lost.

===Theories of the origin of the flag, #3===
A similar theory was suggested by Danish explorer, adventurer and Captain [[Johan Støckel]] in the early [[20th century]]. He suggested that it was not a pope banner to the King but a pope banner to the Churchly legate in the North, more specifically to archbishop [[Andreas Sunesøn]], which he - without the knowledge of the King – brought with him on the King's crusade in the Baltic countries, in an effort to make the army take on a Christian symbol (over the king's symbol) and thereby strengthen the power of the church.

It is unlikely that the very fair and loyal archbishop would do such a thing behind the king's back. Moreover, it is unlikely that the pope would send such a banner, given the fact that they already had one, namely the banner of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (Danish: "Johanitterne").

===Theories of the origin of the flag, #4===
A theory brought forth by the Danish historian [[Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen]] in [[1875]] in his book "''Danebroges Oprindelse''" is that the Danish flag ''is'' the banner of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. He supports his theory with that the order came to Denmark in the latter half of the [[12th century]] and during the next centuries spread to major cities, like [[Odense]], [[Viborg]], [[Horsens]], [[Ribe]] and their headquarters in [[Slagelse]], so by the time of the [[Northern Crusades|Baltic crusade]], the symbol was already a known symbol in Denmark.

Furthermore he claims that [[Theoderich, Bishop of Estonia|Bishop Theoderich]], already a part initiator of the order in [[Livonia]], the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]], had the idea of starting a similar order in Estonia and that he was the original instigator of Bishop [[Albert of Buxhoeveden]] inquiry to King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] in 1218, that set the whole Danish participation in the Baltic crusades in motion.

In the contemporary writing of the priest [[Henry of Livonia]] from [[Riga]] it is said that Bishop Theoderich was killed during the 1219 battle, as the enemy stormed his tent, thinking it was the King's tent. Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen explains that it was Bishop Theoderich who carried the flag, well planted outside his tent, thus as an already well-known Knights Hospitaller symbol in Livonia, the enemy thought this was the King's symbol and mistakenly stormed Bishop Theoderich tent. He claims that the origin of the legend of the falling flag comes from this confusion in the battle.

Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen does not give an explanation how the white [[Maltese cross]] on red of the Knights Hospitaller, found its way to the Danish flag of 1219, given the fact that in that time it was a white cross on black. The Knights Hospitaller is a monk-order and used black dresses. The white on red warrior-cloak cannot be traced until later.

===Theories of the origin of the flag, #5===

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|250px|In [[Paolo Uccello]]'s ''The Princess and the Dragon'' of c. [[1470]],  the design on the knight's cape is similar to the Dannebrog.]]
The Danish church-historian [[L. P. Fabricius]] put up yet another theory. It is explained in his study of [[1934]], titled "''Sagnet om Dannebrog og de ældste Forbindelser med Estland''". In this study he put the location to the [[1208]] Battle of [[Fellin]] and not the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]] in [[1219]], based on the earliest source available about the story.

He says in this theory that it might have been Archbishop [[Andreas Sunesøn]]'s personal ecclestical banner or perhaps even the flag of Archbishop [[Absalon]]. That is based on his tireless efforts to expand [[Christianity]] to the Baltic countries and that under his initiative and supervision several smaller crusades had already been conducted in Estonia. The banner would then already be known in Estonia. He repeats the story about the flag being planted in front of Bishop Theodorik's tent which the enemy mistakenly attacks believing it to be the tent of the King.

All these theories centre on two battles in Estonia, whether it is in Fellin (1208) or Lyndanisse (1219), and thus try to explain the origin in relation to the tale brought forth over 300 years after the event.

===Theories of the origin of the flag, #6===
A much different theory is briefly discussed by ''Fabricius'' and elaborated more by [[Helga Bruhn]] in her book "''Dannebrog''" from [[1949]]. She claims that it is neither the battle nor the banner that is central to the tale, but rather the [[cross]] in the sky. Similar tales of appearances in the sky at critical moments, particularly of crosses, can be found all over Europe.

Bruhn mentions a battle (also mentioned by ''Fabricius'') taking place on September 10, [[1217]] between Christian knights and [[Moors|Moor]] warriors on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] near the castle [[Alcazar]], where it is said that a golden cross on white appeared in the sky, to bring victory to the Christians.
Likewise an almost identical [[Sweden|Swedish]] tale from the [[18th century]] about a yellow cross on blue appearing in [[1157]] during a Swedish battle in [[Finland]]. Probably a later invention to counter the legendary origins of the Danish flags, but nevertheless of the same nature.
The [[Flag of England|English flag]], the [[Saint George]]'s Cross is also claimed to have appeared in the sky during a critical battle, in this case in [[Jerusalem]] during the crusades.

The similarities to the legends is obvious. In Spain, the colours of the Pope appears in the sky, in Finland the Swedish colours. In Estonia it is the Danish colours, and in Jerusalem the English colours. Basically, these are all variations of the same legend.

Since King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] was married to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] princess, [[Berengária of Portugal|Berengaria]], it is not unthinkable that the origin of the story, if not the flag, was the Spanish tale or a similar tale, which again might have been inspired by an even older legend.

==Earliest recorded use of the flag==
[[Image:Erikafpommernsdanskeunionssegl.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Seal of [[Eric of Pomerania]] as king of the [[Kalmar union]], [[1398]]. Note the small Dannebrog banner in the top-left corner.]]
Danish literature of the 13th and 14th centuries remains quiet about the national flag. Whether the flag has its origins in a divine sign, a banner of a military order, an ecclesiastical banner, or perhaps something entirely different, Danish literature is no help before the early [[15th century]].

However, several coins, seals and images exist, both foreign and domestic, from the 13th to 15th centuries and even earlier, showing flags similar to the Dannebrog. In the 19th and early 20th century, these images were used by many Danish historians, with a good flair of [[nationalism]], trying to date the origins of the flag to 1219. However, if one examines the few existing foreign sources about Denmark from the 13th to 15th centuries, it is apparent that, at least from foreign point of view; the national symbol of Denmark was not a red-and-white banner but the royal coat of arms (three blue lions of a golden shield.) This [[Coat of Arms of Denmark|coat of arms]] remains in use to this day.

An obvious place to look for documentation is in the [[Estonia]]n city of [[Tallinn]], the site of the legendary battle. In Tallinn, a coat-of-arms resembling the flag is found on several buildings and can be traced back to the middle of the [[15th century]] where it appears in the coat-of-arms of the "Die Grosse [[guild |Gilde]]", a sort of merchant consortium which greatly influenced the city's development. The symbol later became the coat-of-arms of the city. Efforts to trace it from Estonia back to Denmark have, however, been in vain.

The national [[Coat of Arms of Estonia]], three blue lions on a golden shield, is almost identical to the [[Coat of Arms of Denmark]], and its origin can be traced directly back to King [[Valdemar II]] and Danish rule in [[Estonia]] [[1219]]-[[1346]].

===Earliest undisputed link===
[[Image:55verso Dannebrog 1370.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Page 55 verso in the Dutch [[Gelre Armorial]]. Displaying the earliest known undisputed coloured image of Dannebrog]]
The earliest source that indisputably links the red flag with a white cross to a Danish King, and to the realm itself, is found in a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[armorial]], the "[[Gelre Armorial]]" (Dutch: ''Wapenboek [[Guelders|Gelre]]''), written between [[1340]] and [[1370]] (some sources say [[1378]] or [[1386]]). Most historians claim that the book was written by [[Geldre Claes Heinen]]. The book displays some 1700 coats-of-arms from all over Europe, in colour. It is now located at the Royal Library of Brussels (the "[[Bibliothèque royale Albert Ier]]").

On page 55 verso we find the Danish coat-of-arms surmounted by a helmet with horns. Behind the sinister horn is a lance tip with a banner, displaying a white cross on red. The text left of the coat of arms says "die coninc van denmarke" (''The King of Denmark''). This is the earliest known undisputed colour rendering of the Dannebrog.

This image has been used to acknowledge a previously disputed theory that the cross found in [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar Atterdag]]'s coats of arms located in his Danælog seal ("''Rettertingsseglet''") from [[1356]] is indeed the cross from the Danish flag.

This image from the Armorial Gelre is near identical to an image found in an old coats of arms book from the [[15th century]] now located in the National Archives of Sweden, ("''Riksarkivet''")

From the time of King [[Eric of Pomerania]] we also have a case that undisputedly links Dannebrog to Denmark. His seal from [[1398]] as king of the [[Kalmar union]] displays the arms of Denmark chief dexter, three lions. In this version, the lions are holding a Danebrog banner. The cross quartering the shields has also been identified as a Daneborg cross, but this claim is disputed. Since the seal represents all of the three realms of the union, it is more likely that the cross refers to the union banner that King Eric tried to introduce, a red cross on yellow.

==Laws and flag variations==
Denmark does not have a specified flag law, but various regulations and rules spread out over many documents, from King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s time till today, can be found.

===National flag===
The size and shape of the [[coufhordie]] flag ("''Koffardiflaget''") for merchant ships is given in the regulation of [[June 11]], [[1748]], which says: ''A red flag with a white cross with no split end. The white cross must be 1/7 of the flags height. The two first fields must be square in form and the two outer fields most be 6/4 lengths of those''.

The proportions are thus: 3:1:3 vertically and 3:1:4.5 horizontally. This definition are the absolute proportions for the Danish national flag to this day, for both the civil version of the flag ("''Stutflaget''"), as well as the merchant flag ("''Handelsflaget''"). Both flags are identical.

A somewhat curious regulation came in [[1758]] concerning Danish ships sailing in the [[Mediterranean]]. These had to carry the King's cypher logo in the center of the flag, to distinguish them from Maltese ships, due to the similarity of the flag of the Order of St. John (also known as the [[Knights Hospitaller]]). To the best of knowledge, this regulation has never been revoked, however it is probably no longer done.

According to the regulation of [[June 11]], [[1748]] the colour was simply red, which is common known today as "Dannebrog rød" ("''Dannebrog red''"). The only available red fabric dye in [[1748]] was made of [[madder|madder root]], which can be processed to produce a brilliant red dye (used historically for British soldiers' jackets). The private company, [[Dansk Standard]], regulation number 359 of [[2005]], defines the red colour of the flag as [[Pantone]] 186c. No official nuance definition of "Dannebrog rød" exists.

During the next about 150 years nobody paid much attention to actually abide fully to the proportions of the flag given in the [[1748]] regulation, not even the government.
As late as [[1892]] it was stated in a series of regulations that the correct lengths of the two last fields in the flag were 6/4. Some interested in the matter made inquires into the issue and concluded that the 6/4 length would make the flag look blunt. Any new flag would also quickly become unlawful, due to wear and tear. They also noted that the flag currently used had lengths, of the last two fields, anywhere between 7/4 to 13/6.

So in May [[1893]] a new regulation to all chiefs of police, stated that the police should not intervene, if the two last fields in the flag were longer than 6/4 as long as these did not exceed 7/4, and provided that this was the only rule violated.

This regulation is still in effect today and thus the legal proportions of the National flag is today anywhere between ''3:1:3 width / 3:1:4.5 length'' and ''3:1:3 width / 3:1:5.25 length''.

That some confusion still exists in this matter can be seen from the regulation of [[May 4]], [[1927]], which once again states that Danish merchant ships have to fly flags according to the regulation of [[1748]].

===Splitflag===
[[Image:Flag of Denmark (state).svg|thumb|250px|right|The ''Splitflag'' - the Danish State Flag. [[Image:FIAV 011010.svg|23px]] Proportions: 56:107]]
[[Image:Naval Ensign of Denmark.svg|thumb|250px|right|The ''Orlogsflag'' - the Danish Naval Flag. [[Image:FIAV 000001.svg|23px]] Proportions: 56:107]]
The ''Splitflag'' or ''Orlogsflag'' have similar specifications, but legally, they are two different flags. The ''Splitflag'' is a Danish flag ending in a swallow-tail, it is ''Dannebrog red'', and is used on land. The ''Orlogsflag'' is a ''Splitflag'' with a deeper red colour and is only used on sea.

The ''Orlogsflag'' with no markings, may only be used by the [[Royal Danish Navy]]. There are though a few exceptions to this. A few institutions have been allowed to fly the clean ''Orlogsflag''. Same flag with markings has been approved for a few dozen companies and institutions over the years.

Furthermore, the ''Orlogsflag'' is only described as such if it has no additional markings. Any swallow-tail flag, no matter the color, is called a ''Splitflag'' provided it bears additional markings.

The first regulation regarding the ''Splitflag'' dates from [[March 27]], [[1630]], in which King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] orders that Norwegian ''Defensionskibe'' (armed merchants ships) may only use the ''Splitflag'' if they are in Danish war service.
In [[1685]] an order, distributed to a number of cities in [[Slesvig]], states that all ships must carry the Danish flag, and in [[1690]] all merchant ships are forbidden to use the ''Splitflag'', with the exception of ships sailing in the [[East Indies]], [[West Indies]] and at the coast of [[Africa]].
In [[1741]] it is confirmed that the regulation of [[1690]] is still very much in effect; that merchant ships may not use the ''Splitflag''. At the same time the [[Danish East India Company]] is allowed to fly the ''Splitflag'' when past the [[equator]].

It is obvious that some confusion must have existed regarding the ''Splitflag''. In [[1696]] the Admiralty presented the King with a proposal for a standard regulating both size and shape of the ''Splitflag''. In the same year a royal resolution defines the proportions of the ''Splitflag'', which in this resolution is called ''Kongeflaget'' (the King's flag), as follows: ''The cross must be 1/7 of the flags height. The two first fields must be square in form with the sides three times the cross width. The two outer fields are rectangular and 1½ the length of the square fields. The tails are the length of the flag''.

These numbers are the basic for the ''Splitflag'', or ''Orlogsflag'', today, though the numbers have been slightly altered. The term ''Orlogsflag'' dates from [[1806]] and denotes use in the [[Royal Danish Navy]].

From about [[1750]] to early [[1800]]s a number of ships and companies which the government has interests in, received approval to use the ''Splitflag''. From the mid [[1800]]s to [[1899]], and especially after [[1870]], additional institutions and private companies received approval to use the Splitflag.

In the royal resolution of [[October 25]], [[1939]] for the [[Danish Navy]], it is stated that the ''Orlogsflag'' is a ''Splitflag'' with a deep red ("''Kraprød''" or "''dybrød''") colour. Like the National flag, no nuance is given, but in modern days this is given as 195U.
Furthermore the size and shape is corrected in this resolution to be: "The cross must be 1/7 of the flag's height. The two first fields must be square in form with the height of 3/7 of the flags height. The two outer fields are rectangular and 5/4 the length of the square fields. The tails are 6/4 the length of the rectangular fields".

Thus, if compared to the standard of [[1696]], both the rectangular fields and the tails have decreased in size.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=September 2007}}
The [[HDMY Dannebrog (A540)|royal Danish yacht]] is named after the flag.

[[Dannebrog, Nebraska]] is named for the flag.
