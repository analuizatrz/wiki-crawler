The '''Youngstown Ohio Works''' baseball team was a minor league club that served as a training ground for players and officials who later established careers in [[major league baseball]]. The team is best known for winning the premier championship of the [[Ohio-Pennsylvania League]] in 1905,<ref name="ohio-pa-1905">{{cite web | url = http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0 | title = Ohio-Pennsylvania League of 1905 | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> and launching the professional career of pitcher [[Roy Castleton]] a year later.<ref name="Society for American Baseball Research ">{{cite web | url = http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2264&bid=1194 | title = Roy Castleton  | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref> The ball club proved a formidable regional competitor and won the 1906 league championship before its dissolution in 1907.<ref name="baseball-reference">{{cite web | url = http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Ohio-Pennsylvania_League | title = Ohio-Pennsylvania League | publisher = Baseball Reference | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}</ref>

In September 1905, the Youngstown Ohio Works won the first league championship, though sources disagree on the club's final record. This confusion may owe to the disorganized nature of the new league, with its sprawling roster of 11 teams.<ref name="ohio-pa-1905">{{cite web | url = http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0 | title = Ohio-Pennsylvania League of 1905 | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> According to the ''Spalding Guide'' (1906), "The failure to furnish official reports was probably due to the clubs being new to a league".<ref>''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1906), p. 289.</ref> 

Baseball researcher John Zajc summarizes the varied accounts as follows: "''The Reach Guide'' (1906) credits Youngstown with an 84-32 won-lost record where the ''Spalding Guide'' of the same year list a 90-35 record. The ''Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball'' (1993) tells a third story, giving Youngstown an 88-35 mark".<ref name="ohio-pa-1905">{{cite web | url = http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0 | title = Ohio-Pennsylvania League of 1905 | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> Despite this uncertainty over the club's record, its championship status was apparent, and the team became popularly known as "the Champs".<ref name="vindy-yo-06-19-06">{{cite news

== Final season ==

By the outset of the 1906 season, the Ohio-Pennsylvania League had trimmed down to a more manageable eight teams.<ref name="Society for American Baseball Research ">{{cite web | url = http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2264&bid=1194 | title = Roy Castleton  | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref> The Youngstown team enjoyed another stellar year, closing the season with an 84-53 record and winning its second consecutive league championship.<ref name="baseball-reference">{{cite web | url = http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Ohio-Pennsylvania_League | title = Ohio-Pennsylvania League | publisher = Baseball Reference | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}</ref>

Early in the season, as the team prepared for a second game with the [[Zanesville]] (Ohio) Moguls, close rivals in the 1905 championship games,<ref>''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1906), p. 289.</ref> manager Hogan spoke confidently on his club's chances of capturing the league pennant. "If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will have no trouble winning out", he said to a reporter with ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator''. "Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no .350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable to step in and break up a game".<ref name="vindy-yo-06-19-06">{{cite news

The manager's confidence was rewarded. An article published in the ''[[The Vindicator|Youngstown Daily Vindicator]]'' in October 1906 stated that the local team ended the season with its third consecutive state [[pennant]] in hand.<ref name="vindy-yo-10-14-06">{{cite news

== Dissolution ==
[[Image:zsignal.jpg|thumb|left|110px|''Zanesville Signal'', February 18, 1907]]
Despite the club's apparent success, disagreements over funding led to its sale and relocation. On [[February 18]], [[1907]], the ''Zanesville Signal'' reported that manager Hogan had received permission from "the Messrs. McDonald" (Joseph McDonald and brother Thomas G. McDonald) to [[negotiation|negotiate]] a $3,000 deal for the sale of the team, including its players, to a group of Zanesville [[investors]].<ref name="Zanesville-signal">{{cite news

The ball club manager's evident frustration during this period was reflected in comments published in ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'' almost a week after the team's sale. When questioned on his widely publicized decision to resign as manager of the Youngstown club before the opening of the 1907 season, Hogan reportedly said that he had received "the short end of the deal".<ref name="vindy-yo-2-24-07">{{cite news

The Youngstown Ohio Works team not only gave pitcher Roy Castleton a prized "shot" at the major leagues, but it also played an indirect role in launching the career of [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] umpire [[Billy Evans]]. On [[September 1]], [[1903]], Evans, a reporter at ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', was assigned to cover a game between the Ohio Works and the [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], Library Athletic Club that was held in Youngstown. Evans took his first step toward a legendary career when club manager Hogan offered him $15 to fill an umpire vacancy.<ref name="baker">{{cite news

Ultimately, the story of the Ohio Works team proved to be an early chapter in Youngstown's rich history of amateur and minor league baseball. In the 1930s and '40s, the city served as a perennial host to the National Amateur Baseball Federation championship, eliciting praise from organization officials for the pristine condition of the community's sandlot [[baseball diamond]]s, which they described as among the best in the country.<ref name="ward">{{cite news
