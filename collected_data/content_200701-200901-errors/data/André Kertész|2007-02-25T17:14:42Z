'''André Kertész''' (born Kertész Andor [[July 2]], [[1894]] - [[September 28]], [[1985]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born photographer distinguished by haunting [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] in his photographs and by his early efforts in developing the [[photo essay]]. In his lifetime, however, his then-unorthodox camera angles, which hindered [[prose]] descriptions of his works, prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. His use of [[symbolism]] also became unfashionable later in his life. Kertész is now recognized as one of the seminal figures of [[photojournalism]].

Born in [[Budapest]], the son of a bookseller, Kertész taught himself how to use a camera and had his first photos published while a member of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army during [[World War I]]. Even as early as 1914 (e.g. "Eugene, 1914") his distinctive and mature style was already evident.

Kertész emigrated to [[Paris]] in [[1925]], changed his first name from Andor, and became acquainted with members of the [[Dada]] movement. One of them dubbed him "Brother Seeing Eye", an allusion to a medieval monastery where all the monks were blind except one. His greatest journalistic collaboration was with the French editor and publisher [[Lucien Vogel]], who ran his photographs without explanatory prose. He created portraits of (among others) the painters [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] and [[Marc Chagall]], the writer [[Colette]], and film-maker [[Sergei Eisenstein]]. In Paris he found critical and commercial success, and he was the first photographer in the world ever to have a one-man exhibition (1927). He was a mentor to many famous names in photography; [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] said, "We all owe something to Kertész".

In [[1936]] Kertész and his wife Erzsebet (later altered to Elizabeth) went to the [[United States]] to escape the increasing tension in Europe that was leading to [[World War II]]. The [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Publishing]] empire had signed Kertész to a long-term contract, which meant he spent most of his time photographing famous homes for [[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]] magazine. However, his personal photographic style did not mesh well with the straightforward fashion photography the American public (and magazines) expected. He continued to exhibit his individual work as best he could but his reputation slowly faded, and he became disillusioned.

His work did not appear in [[Edward Steichen|Steichen's]] famous [[The Family of Man]] show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], but in [[1964]], soon after [[John Szarkowski]] became the photography director at the museum, Kertész had a solo show which relaunched his career and reputation. He caught the mood of the times and became something of an elder statesman to the photographers of the late [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]]. They had been seeking to validate a tradition of documentary/art photography through linking it back to the Paris photographers of the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]].

By the mid-1970s he was showing his work in galleries all over the world. He continued working very productively into old age, and was experimenting with instant [[Polaroid]] photography shortly before he died.
