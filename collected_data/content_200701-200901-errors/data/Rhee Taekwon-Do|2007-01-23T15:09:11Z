Approximately 1300 years ago, during the [[Silla Dynasty]] in [[Korea]] an ancient form of unarmed combat - known these days as [[Tae-Kyon]] evolved. The ancient Art of Tae-Kyon is now widely dispersed throughout the world and known as various forms of [[Taekwon-Do]]. The definition of Rhee Taekwon-Do involves dynamic techniques of unarmed combat for self-defensive purposes, combining the skilled application of powerful punches, flying kicks, blocks, dodges and interceptions- the Rhee Taekwon-Do practitioner uses well trained hands, arms and feet to effect the rapid destruction of any attacker. Master Rhee is the official Founder of Taekwon-Do in [[Australia]]; the Master Instructor and-Chief Instructor for Australia and [[New Zealand]], President of the Taekwon-Do Instructors Federation of Australia and New Zealand.

Rhee Taekwon-Do teaches controlled technique. It is regarded as one of the most dynamic and effective Arts of self-defence and so, during training, all techniques delivered by all parts of the body are properly executed and well controlled. This means that there is no injury as a result of uncontrolled blows during training.

All ages are able to train in Rhee Taekwon-Do. When studying Rhee Taekwon-Do, students are not permitted to study any other form of martial art. This both indicates loyalty to the school, as well has helping to keep the students focused on their chosen style.

Master Chong Chul Rhee acquired vast international experience before coming to Australia. He was a leading instructor of the Korean Marines, Police Force, students at universities and colleges and members of the public. Master Rhee developed and taught special unarmed combat methods to the Marine Commandos, the elite Commandos' underwater demolition team, Marine Brigade Headquarters and Marine 2nd Infantry Divisions. (The Korean Marines earned a reputation as the world's most feared and courageous troops. Nicknamed 'The Demon Hunter Marines", they were easily recognised on the battle fields and were the most disciplined, daring and highly efficient elite of the armed forces.)

Master Chong Chul Rhee then spent some years in South East Asia - including [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Brunei]] and other countries - teaching the Art of Tae Kwon Do. Tae Kwon Do is booming in these countries today and many thousands of students are reaping the benefits of Master Rhee's dedication to the Art. Since introducing the Art of Rhee Tae Kwon Do in Australia, - Master Chong Chul Rhee has led hundreds of demonstrations throughout the nation. He has demonstrated the Art at universities, colleges, Air Force bases, Army and Police academies, and to the public. He has been featured in countless newspaper and magazine articles and brought the spectacular Art of Tae Kwon Do to millions of television viewers.

Through unending hard work and perseverance Master Rhee has established a very strong foundation for the art of Tae Kwon Do with the assistance of a massive network of [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] assistant instructors. Master Rhee's wealth of technical and teaching experience and highly skilled technique have contributed substantially to Rhee Tae Kwon Do's dynamic expansion throughout Australia and New Zealand.

== Belt System ==

There are 10 coloured belt grades (kups) in Rhee Taekwon-Do, as well as the black belt degrees (dans). The tips are represented by a stripe of the higher colour on one end of a belt of the lower colour. Dans are represented by a white stripe embroidered on the black belt, and a black belt without a stripe is a Junior Black Belt, a degree given to members considered too young for a 1st dan. They are as follows:

{|

== Sparring ==

Sparring in Rhee Taekwon-Do is different to that in other Taekwon-Do schools. Instead of a points-based system while wearing body armour, the sparring is unscored, unarmoured, and non-contact. This means that while attacks are executed with full power and speed, they are stopped just short of the opponent's body. This teaches greater control over attacks, and also prevents the art from descending to the level of a sport, where there are no students, no instructors, only point scored against the opponent.

Students of Rhee Tae Kwon-Do are not permitted to participate in points-based sparring competitions run by the [[International Taekwondo Federation|ITF]]
