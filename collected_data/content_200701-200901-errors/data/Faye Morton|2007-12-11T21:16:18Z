'''Faye Morton''' is a fictional character in the [[BBC]] [[medical drama]] ''[[Holby City]]'', portrayed by actress [[Patsy Kensit]]. The character first appeared on January 30, 2007 in the episode "Into the Dark" - [[List of Holby City episodes/Series Nine#Series Nine .282006-2007.29|Series 9, Episode 17]] of the program. Kensit had made a former unrelated guest appearance on ''Holby City's'' sister show [[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]] in 2001.

The character's role in the show is that of mysterious [[femme fatale]] - seemingly meek and shy but with a murderous past,<ref name="dubai">{{cite episode |title=What Lies Beneath |episodelink=List_of_Holby_City_episodes/Series_Nine#Series_Nine_.282006-2007.29 |series=Holby City |serieslink=Holby City |network=[[BBC]] | season       = 9

== Creation ==
===Background===

Faye Morton was one of six new characters to join ''[[Holby City|Holby City's]]'' cast in [[List of Holby City episodes/Series Nine#Series Nine .282006-2007.29|Series 9]].<ref name="series9">{{cite web|url=http://www.holby.tv/db/index.php?id=9,1848,0,0,1,0|title=Holby City Series 9|publisher=holby.tv|accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref>
Since [[List of Holby City episodes/Series Eight#Series Eight .282005-2006.29|Series 8 Episode 10]] "The Long Goodbye", and the departure from the show of its [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|Maternity]] ward, the series has focused on three central wards - two surgical wards and an [[Acute Assessment Unit]]. Prior to the introduction of the character of Faye, there were just two [[Nurse#Nursing titles|Ward Sisters]] between these three wards - [[Chrissie Williams]] and [[Kyla Tyson]].  This imbalance was redressed with Faye's arrival and fast promotion from [[Nurse#Nursing titles|Bank Nurse]] to Sister of [[Holby City#Current wards|Keller Ward]].<ref name="promotion">{{cite episode

Early publicity for the character gave her name as 'Eliza Clark'.  It is unknown at what stage in creation this changed to 'Faye Morton' - while Faye was the name announced by the BBC with the news of Kensit's casting in December 2005,<ref name="patsy"/> the actress was still referring to her character as Eliza as late at November 2006, when interviewed for the [[Inside Soap]] Yearbook 2007.<ref name="insidesoap">{{Citation

===Casting===

Although Faye did not first appear on-screen until February 2007, the announcement that [[Patsy Kensit]] had been cast as the character was made on December 14, 2005.<ref name="patsy">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4527980.stm|title=Patsy Kensit to join Holby cast|date=December 14, 2005|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref> ''Holby City's'' Executive Producer Richard Stokes and Series Producer Emma Turner said of Kensit's casting: "We are delighted to confirm that Patsy Kensit is joining the cast of Holby City.

Kensit also spoke of the forty-five minute commute to work on ''Holby'' as a deciding factor in her move from her previous role in  [[ITV]] soap ''[[Emmerdale]]'' - the long journey to and from filming the latter show cutting heavily into her time available to spend with her two sons.<ref name="commute">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.excite.co.uk/news/soaps/26170|title=Patsy Kensit joins Holby City cast|publisher=[[Excite]]|date=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> She described Faye as her dream role,<ref name="castinterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/asktheactors/interviews/index.shtml?content/_patsy/page1|title=Holby City - Interviews|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> and revealed that in preparation for portraying the character, she spent three days shadowing a real nurse,<ref name="rt" /> as well as witnessing open heart surgery at [[University College Hospital]], London, in order to bring realism to the part.<ref name ="castinterview" /> Kensit said of the experience:

{{cquote|I wanted to throw up. First of all I stood in the corner but in the end I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women.

In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in [[List of Casualty episodes VII#Series Sixteen .282001-2002.29|Series 16]] of ''Holby City's'' sister show ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', appearing as a [[domestic abuse]] victim in episode 14, "Happily Ever After".<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0537305/fullcredits#cast|title="Casualty" Happily Ever After (2001)|publisher=[[IMDb]]|date=|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> She gave what TV critic [[Ian Hyland]] billed "a convincing performance",<ref name="casualty">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20011216/ai_n14541982|title=Ian Hyland's TV week: GORE BLIMEY..

[[The Daily Mirror|The Daily Mirror's]] television critic [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] has noted that Kensit's casting in the role follows a recent trend of ''Holby City'' producers for hiring established actors, including [[comedian]] [[Adrian Edmondson]] and [[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|''Jesus of Nazareth'']] star [[Robert Powell]].<ref name="shelley">{{cite web|author=[[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]]|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,,2182492,00.html|title=How to make a BBC medical drama|date=[[3 October]] [[2007]]|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref>

==Development==
===Personality===

Initial publicity for the character stressed her enigmatic origins, with the BBC billing her "a nurse who has more than a few secrets to hide and an attitude that cannot fail to ruffle the feathers of her colleagues."<ref name="intro">{{cite web|url=http://www.holby.tv/cgi-bin/News/fullnews.cgi?newsid1134566767,99035,|title=Patsy Kensit joins Holby|date=[[14 December]] [[2005]]|publisher=holby.tv|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> This was reflected in her first on-screen appearance, whereby she simply arrived at [[Holby City Hospital]] one day and requested that [[Specialist registrar|registrars]] [[Jac Naylor]] and [[Joseph Byrne]] help her secure a nursing position without having to officially mention her previous employment in [[Dubai]].<ref name="intothedark">{{cite episode

Her lack of fear in challenging [[Surgeon|Staff Surgeon]] [[Thandie Abebe|Thandie Abebe's]] patient care in episode "Leap of Faith", regardless of negative reaction of her colleagues, led [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] [[General Surgery|General Surgeon]] [[Dan Clifford]] to promote her on the spot to the position of [[Nurse#Nursing titles|Ward Sister]].<ref name="promotion" />

In discussing the character, The [[Daily Express]] described her as "Gregarious...likes a gossip, but she's emotionally vulnerable",<ref name="express" /> while ''Holby'' actress [[Tina Hobley]] compared her to her own character, [[Chrissie Williams]], explaining that "Faye is a quieter character all round who will do anything for an easy life, whereas Chrissie likes to stir up a bit of drama. I think she sees Faye as a goody two shoes."<ref name="express" /> A darker side to the character's personality has also been explored, from her calm reaction to her husband's death,<ref name="dubai" /> to her moral ambivalence at stealing a ring left to Jac Naylor in an attempt to win favour with Joseph Byrne.<ref name="cod" />

===Relationships===

Currently, the character's relationship history prior to arriving in Holby remains largely an enigma. Although the BBC state she has been married three times,<ref name="character">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/characters/profiles/index.shtml?content/_faye/page1|title=Holby City - Characters|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref> only her most recent husband [[Minor characters in Holby City#Relatives 2|James]] has ever been mentioned on-screen.  While it was never explicitly shown to be so, it was heavily implied in flashback episode "What Lies Beneath" that Faye was responsible for his death.<ref name="dubai" /> Commenting on this aspect of her character, [[Patsy Kensit|Kensit]] explained that:
[[Image:FayeMorton.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Sam dates both Faye and Chrissie at the same time]]

{{cquote|So there’s a scuffle and he pins her against the wall and practically tries to rape her. He ends up dead. It’s the way she deals with it — she coolly steps over his body and leaves.

Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a tentative relationship with [[Specialist registrar|Cardiothoracic Registrar]] [[Sam Strachan]]. The situation soon escalated into a [[love triangle]], with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron [[Chrissie Williams]].  Kensit said of the relationship in [[August]] [[2007]], as the storyline was ongoing: "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now.  But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!"<ref name="totaltv">{{Citation

Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and has now most recently been romantically linked with [[Joseph Byrne]].

==Storylines==

[[Image:JamesWilsonHC.png|thumb|right|250px|Faye leaves her husband for dead in Dubai]]
<!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Try to keep this section brief. Not every plot detail needs to be added here, especially since the show is currently ongoing. -->
Faye arrives in episode "Into the Dark", requesting that [[Specialist registrar|Registrars]] [[Joseph Byrne]] and [[Jac Naylor]], help her gain employment as a [[Nursing in the United Kingdom#Hierarchy .26 roles|Bank Nurse]] without having to give details of her most recent employment history. During her first few months at Holby City Hospital, Faye remains close to Joseph, but does not get on well with Jac, who she speaks to sternly about her close relationship with Joseph’s father, [[Minor characters in Holby City#Relatives 2|Lord Byrne]].  In episode "What Lies Beneath" , flashbacks occur to the trio’s meeting in [[Dubai]].  Faye’s husband [[Minor characters in Holby City#Relatives 2|James]] reveals to her that he has lost her life savings of £50,000, ruining her plans of buying a nursing home in England.  The pair fight, and as James forces himself upon her at the top of their staircase, the scene cuts away.  An indefinite period of time later, Faye descends the stairs calmly, and steps over James’s dead body.<ref name="dubai" /> Although she is questioned by police over James’s death, she is not charged.

Faye worries her colleagues will find out about her arrest when she is recognised by [[Minor characters in Holby City#Relatives 2|Harvey Tyson]], the policeman husband of AAU‘s [[Nursing in the United Kingdom#Hierarchy .26 roles|Acting Sister]] [[Kyla Tyson]].<ref name="somethingishouldknow" /> Faye and Kyla strike up a friendship, and Faye supports Kyla through her [[Kyla Tyson#Domestic abuse|domestic abuse]] ordeal at the hands of her husband, his subsequent death, and the loss of her son to [[foster care]].<ref name="trust" /> Also during this period, Faye resists the advances of hospital lothario [[Sam Strachan]], and impresses General Surgical Consultant [[Daniel Clifford]] with her approach to patient care - leading to an on the spot promotion after a clash with [[Thandie Abebe]] in episode "Leap of Faith".<ref name="promotion" />

Fellow nurse [[Donna Jackson]] aspires to set Faye up with Sam Strachan, and the pair agree to go for a drink. Faye is the only member of nursing staff not to follow union action in episode ''Countdown'', earning her the approval of [[Connie Beauchamp]], the mother of Sam‘s daughter [[Minor characters in Holby City#Relatives|Grace]]. In episode "Damned If You Do", Sam surprises Faye with a gift of a diamond necklace, but also begins cheating on her with his old flame, [[Chrissie Williams]].  Faye terminates their relationship upon discovering his infidelity, and turns her attention to Joseph, who had tried to warn her about Sam's indiscretion. She supports Joseph when he is tormented by Jac about the relationship she had had with his father prior to his recent death, and goes as far as to steal back a ring once promised to Joseph, which Jac received in Lord Byrne's will.  Joseph however is upset by her casual theft, and declines when she later asks him out.<ref name="cod" />

On 11th December 2007, Faye was shot in the back with a crossbow by STI Clinician Tim. Tim opened fire in Holby after being ignored and ridiculed about his STI warnings. Martha and Zoe were also shot.

}}</ref> The publication discussed the topic of nurses in popular culture, and the negative impression of the nursing profession conveyed by fictional nurses.  With a promotional image of [[Patsy Kensit|Kensit]] as Faye adorning the front cover, the magazine asserted:

{{cquote|The "did she, didn't she", story of the Dubai murder of Faye Morton's partner in Holby City recently demonstrates the ease with which writers can attach terrible storylines to a caring profession. Nurses who become prostitutes to pay the bills, nurses who kill their husbands, nurses who abuse the system to get their own way - Holby City has always been a hotbed of slanderous storylines. Good people doing bad things makes excellent entertainment... The bald fact is that real life nurses doing their jobs well just aren't that entertaining.<ref name="nmc" />}}

This criticism was echoed by The [[Daily Mirror]], who, commenting on an interview Kensit had given to publicise the show and her role with [[Jonathan Ross]], suggested that 'reality' was not a term that could be applied to ''Holby City'''s portrayal of nursing.<ref name="reality">{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/tv/shelleyvision/2007/04/24/d-oh-89520-18952403/|title=
