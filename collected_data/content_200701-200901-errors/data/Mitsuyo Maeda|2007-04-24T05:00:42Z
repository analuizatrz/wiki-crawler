== Biography == 

Maeda was born in Funazawa Village, [[Hirosaki City]], [[Aomori Prefecture]], on November 18, 1878. He attended Kenritsu Itiu high school (currently Hirokou - a Hirosaki school).<ref name="stanlei1"/> As a child, he was known as Hideyo.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R. "The Circle and the Octagon: Maeda's Judo and Gracie's Jiu-jitsu." In Thomas A. Green and Joseph R. Svinth, eds. ''Martial Arts in the Modern World.'' Westport, Connecticut, 2003, pp. 61-70.</ref>

He practiced [[sumo]] as a teenager, but lacked the ideal build for this sport. His interest in judo arrived because of this unsuitability to sumo, combined with stories about the success of judo during contests between judo and [[jujutsu]] that were occurring at the time. At seventeen years old, in [[1894]], his parents sent him to [[Tokyo]] to enroll in [[Waseda University]]. He took up [[Kodokan Institute|Kodokan]] judo the following year.<ref name="stanlei1"/>

=== Formative years at the Kodokan ===

Upon arriving in the Kodokan, Maeda, who was 1m 64cm tall and weighted 64kg, was confused with a delivery boy due to his country manners and demeanor. Judo's founder [[Jigoro Kano]] spotted the  boy, and promptly assigned him to Tsunejiro Tomita (4th [[Dan_rank|dan]]), who was the smallest of the teachers of the Kodokan's ''shiten-no'', as a measure to show that in judo, size was not important.<ref name="stanlei1"/> Tomita was the first Kodokan judoka and a close friend to Jigoro Kano. According to Koyassu Massao (9th dan):
{{cquote|Among the four Kodokan ''shiten-no'', it was Tomita who received the greatest amount of teachings from Jigoro Kano ''sensei'' [...] as a fighter he wasn't so successful as Saigo, [[Yoshiaki Yamashita|Yamashita]] and Yokoyama, but was exceptional in applied studies and was also fluent in the English language [...]<ref name="stanlei1"/>}}
Although the weakest of Kodokan ''shinte-no'', Tomita was able to defeat the great jujutsu champion of that time, Hansuke Nakamura, from the Tenjin Shinyo Ryu style.<ref name="stanlei1"/>

Mitsuyo Maeda formed with Soishiro Satake the head of the second generation of Kodokan judoka which replaced the first by the beginning of the 20th century.

</ref> Satake, with 1m 75cm and 80kg, had no match in amateur sumo but admitted that he himself wasn't a match to Maeda in Judo.<ref name="stanlei4"/> Satake would later travel together with Maeda and settle himself in [[Manaus]], [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas State]], while Maeda keep traveling. Satake would be the founder in [[1914]] of the first historically registered Judo academy in [[Brazil]]. Together with Maeda, both are considered the pioneers of Judo in Brazil.<ref name="stanlei4"/>

At that time few were the graduated Kodokan judoka. Maeda and Satake were the top graduated professors at Waseda University, both  ''sandan'', along with Matsuhiro Ritaro (''nidan'') and six other shodan.<ref name="stanlei5">

[[Kyuzo Mifune]] registered in the Kodokan in [[1903]] and attracted Maeda's attention who commented ''"you are strong and competent, therefore, you will certainly leave your mark in the Kodokan..."''. However, Mifune went to learn under Sakujiro Yokoyama. Later, already a celebrated judoka, Mifune expressed that Maeda's words were fundamental and a great incentive to him, as he regarded Maeda with the greatest admiration, even though Yokoyama was his ''sensei''.<ref name="stanlei5"/> 

According to Mifune, in [[1904]] Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by [[Hane Goshi]], after defeating three adversaries in succession, but then, in a following ''tsukinami-shiai'' defeated eight adversaries in a row, and was awarded the 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda was one of the biggest promoters of Judo, although not by properly teaching Judo, but, instead, forcing Judo recognition through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines.<ref name="stanlei5"/>

Maeda treated experienced and unexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned his behavior as a respectful measure towards his students but was often misunderstood and scared many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.<ref name="stanlei4" />

=== Prelude to Kodokan's expansion ===

In [[1879]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], the former [[President of the United States]], went to Japan. While in [[Tokyo]], he attended a jujutsu presentation at [[Shibusawa Eiichi]]'s home in Asukayama. Jigoro Kano was one of the jujutsuka present.<ref name="japan times April 18, 1922">''Japan Times,'' April 18, 1922, p. 5.</ref><ref name="waterhouse"> Waterhouse, David. "Kanō Jigorō and the Beginnings of the Jūdō Movement," Toronto, symposium, 1982, pp. 169-178.</ref> By that time, jujutsu was already being mentioned in Europe and North America, and foreigners with dubious knowledge based on poor sources (obscure books and papers) capitalized on this. Judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time, and even many years after the arrival of Kodokan professors both were regarded as the same art, only finally being set apart after the 1950s.<ref name="stanlei6">

In 1903, a senior Kodokan instructor named [[Yoshiaki Yamashita]] traveled to the United States at the request of the Seattle businessman [[Samuel_Hill|Sam Hill]]. In Washington, D.C., Yamashita's students included [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and other prominent Americans. Through Roosevelt's request, Yamashita also taught judo at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]].<ref>Svinth, Joseph R. (2000) "Professor Yamashita Goes to Washington."[http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth1_1000.htm]]]</ref> Appreciating the good publicity, the Japanese Legation in the USA asked the Kodokan to send more judo teachers to America, thereby giving continuity to Yamashita's work. Tomita reluctantly accepted the task; Maeda and Satake embraced the opportunity.<ref name="stanlei6"/>

=== Career ===

==== United States ====

[[Image:Tomita.jpg|left|thumb|Tsunejiro Tomita]]

Tomita, Maeda and Satake sailed from [[Yokohama]] on November 16, 1904, and arrived in [[New York City]] on December 8, 1904.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R. "The Circle and the Octagon: Maeda's Judo and Gracie's Jiu-jitsu." In Thomas A. Green and Joseph R. Svinth, eds. ''Martial Arts in the Modern World.'' Westport, Connecticut, 2003, pp. 61-70.</ref>

During early 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave several public demonstrations of judo. On February 17, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a demonstration at [[Princeton University]]. Maeda threw N.B. Tooker, a Princeton football player, while Tomita threw Samuel Feagles, the Princeton gymnasium instructor.<ref>''Baltimore Sun'', February 18, 1905.</ref> On February 21, 1905, they gave a judo demonstration at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point. Tomita and Maeda did [[kata]] -- nage-no, koshiki, ju-no, etc. At the request of the crowd, Maeda wrestled a cadet and threw him easily. Because Tomita had been thrower in the kata, the cadets wanted to wrestle him, too. Tomita threw the first (Charles Daly) without any trouble. However, Tomita twice failed to throw another football player named Tipton using tomoe-nage (stomach throw). Tomita was smaller, so the Japanese claimed a moral victory.<ref>''Baltimore Sun'', February 22, 1905.</ref> The Americans just laughed, and instead hired [[Tom_Jenkins_(Wrestler)| Tom Jenkins]], a former world champion professional wrestler, to be the Academy wrestling coach. 

The two Japanese did better at the New York Athletic Club on March 8, 1905. "Their best throw was a sort of flying cartwheel," said an article in the ''New York Times,'' describing Maeda's match with John Naething, a 200-lb. wrestler.  "Because of the difference in methods the two men rolled about the mat like schoolboys in a rough-and-tumble fight." After fifteen minutes of wrestling, Maeda secured the first fall." Ultimately, however, Naething was awarded the match by pin fall.<ref>''New York Times'', March 9, 1905.</ref>

On March 21, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a "jiu-do" demonstation at [[Columbia University]] attended by about 200 people. Following introductions, Tomita demonstrated falls and throws, then Maeda threw the university's wrestling instructor. According to the student newspaper, "Another interesting feature was the exhibition of some of the obsolete jiu jitsu tricks for defense with a fan against an opponent armed with the curved Japanese sword." Translations were provided by chemist [[Takamine Jokichi]].<ref>''Columbia Spectator'', March 22, 1905.</ref>

During April 1905, Tomita and Maeda started a judo club in commercial space at 1947 Broadway in New York. Members of this club included Japanese expatriates,<ref>''New York Times'', April 6, 1905.</ref> plus a European American woman named Wilma Berger.<ref>Gregory, O.H. ''Judo: The Modern School of Jiu-Jitsu''. (Chicago: O.H. Gregory, no date but about 1906).</ref> 

On July 6, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a judo exhibition at the [[YMCA]] in [[Newport%2C_Rhode_Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]].<ref>''Newport Herald'', July 7, 1905.</ref> On September 30, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a demonstration at another YMCA, this time the one in [[Lockport_%28city%29%2C_New_York|Lockport]], New York. In Lockport, the local opponent was Mason Shimer, who wrestled Tomita unsuccessfully.<ref>''Lockport Journal'', October 7, 1905.</ref>

On November 6, 1905, Maeda was reported visiting professional wrestler Akitaro Ono in [[Asheville]], [[North Carolina]];<ref>''Asheville Gazette-News'', November 6, 1905. Ono arrived in [[San Francisco]] on April 20, 1905, aboard the same ship as a Japanese college baseball team. Ono said that his goal was to teach judo at West Point. For this, ''Washington Post'', April 21, 1905. However, as noted, the Military Academy hired Tom Jenkins rather than a judo teacher, so instead Ono took up [[professional wrestling]], and American wrestler Charley Olson's subsequent battering of Ono caused a minor diplomatic incident later that year. For more on this, see ''Catch Wrestling: A Wild and Wooly Look at the Early Days of Pro Wrestling in America''. Boulder, Colorado: Paladin Press, 2005, pp. 79-88.</ref> after this, Maeda was no longer routinely associated in the US newspapers with Tomita. 

On December 18, 1905, Maeda was in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], for a professional wrestling match with Sam Marburger. The contest was best of three, two falls with jackets and one without, and Maeda won the two with jackets and lost the one without. According to the Atlanta papers, Maeda listed his residence as the YMCA in [[Selma]], [[Alabama]].<ref>''Atlanta Journal'', December 18, 1905 and December 20, 1905.</ref>

==== Europe ====

Before traveling to Europe, Maeda and Satake went to Cuba along with Akitaro Ono and Tokugoro Ito. All of them engaged in combats. It was during this time that Maeda defeated Adobamond, the "number one" fighter in Cuba.<ref name="stanlei7">{{cite book

On February 8, 1907, Maeda and Satake arrived in [[Liverpool, England]]. Apparently this was to join up with Akitaro Ono, who had gone to [[London, England| London]] to wrestle for promoter William Bankier in London music halls.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R. "The Circle and the Octagon: Maeda's Judo and Gracie's Jiu-jitsu." In Thomas A. Green and Joseph R. Svinth, eds. ''Martial Arts in the Modern World.'' Westport, Connecticut, 2003, pp. 61-70.</ref> In London, Maeda paid the rent mostly by wrestling professionally. On January 1908, he participated in a tournament at the Alhambra. Maeda was runner-up in the heavyweight division, losing to Austria's Henry Irslinger.[http://www.geocities.com/henryirslinger]In February 1908, Maeda participated in another  wrestling tournament. Again, he ended up runner-up, this time losing to Jimmy Esson.<ref>''Health and Strength,'' February 15, 1908, p. 152.</ref><ref>"Commonwealth Wrestling" [http://groups.msn.com/CommonwealthWrestling/historyofwrestlingfreestylepage2.msnw]</ref> However, in March 1908, Maeda beat Henry Irslinger in a match that ''Health & Strength'' magazine described as "one of the squarest, straightest which have been held in England in many years."<ref>''Health and Strength,'' March 14, 1908, p. 257.</ref>  Maeda also appears to have done some wrestling in [[Scotland]] during September 1908, as several Japanese were reported giving demonstrations of judo and sumo at the Northern Games in [[Inverness]].<ref>''Inverness Courier,'' September 18 and September 22, 1908.</ref> In between, Maeda gave judo lessons. His students included a man named W.E. Steers. Steers was very enthusiastic about his lessons, even going to Japan to earn first-dan grading in 1912. In 1918, Steers was among the first non-Japanese to join the London jujutsu club known as the [[Budokwai]], which in 1920 would join the Kodokan to become a Judo club.<ref>Bowen, Richard. "History, Vol. I"[http://www.budokwai.org/history_vol_i.htm]</ref>

After the match with Henry Inslinger in March 1908, Maeda went to [[Belgium]]. He didn't like Belgium, so he soon returned to London, and in May 1908, he participated in a professional wrestling tournament at Hengler's Circus. Maeda and another Japanese, Tano Matsuda, entered as middleweights, and neither man reached the finals.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R. "The Circle and the Octagon: Maeda's Judo and Gracie's Jiu-jitsu." In Thomas A. Green and Joseph R. Svinth, eds. ''Martial Arts in the Modern World.'' Westport, Connecticut, 2003, pp. 61-70.</ref> During January 1909, Matsuda became notorious for losing a mixed match to the African American boxer Sam McVey.<ref>Lima, Ohio ''Daily News,'' January 11, 1909</ref>

Maeda went to Spain in June 1908. He was accompanied by Fujisake, Ono, and Hirano. While in [[Barcelona]], Maeda had matches with Sadakazu Uyenishi and Taro Miyake.<ref>Gutiérrez, C. and Espartero, J. "Jujutsu's image in Spain's wrestling shows: A historic review". ''Journal of Asian Martial Arts,'' 2, 2003, pp. 8-31.</ref> Phoebe Roberts, a Welsh woman who was advertised as the female judo champion of the world, was part of the entourage. Roberts subsequently married Hirano, and stayed in Portugal for the rest of her life.<ref>Svinth, Joseph R. "The Evolution of Women's Judo, 1900-1945"[http://ejmas.com/jalt/jaltart_svinth_0201.htm]</ref> 

===== Conde Koma origin =====
It was during the Iberian trip that Maeda adopted the stage name ''Conde Koma''. There are many theories explaining its origin. It can be an allusion to Komaru, which in Japanese means "troubled," and provided an ironic reference to his always being broke.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R. "The Circle and the Octagon: Maeda's Judo and Gracie's Jiu-jitsu." In Thomas A. Green and Joseph R. Svinth, eds. ''Martial Arts in the Modern World.'' Westport, Connecticut, 2003, pp. 61-70.</ref> 

Maeda stated in a European magazine:
{{cquote|An influential Spanish citizen, impressed with my victories, posture and demeanor, [...] gave me this title which soon spread everywhere in detriment of my real name.<ref name="stanlei9">{{cite book

Maeda was fond of the name and started using it to promote his art thereafter.<ref name = "stanlei9" />

==== Cuba, Mexico, and Central America ====

During November 1908, Maeda went to [[Paris, France]], apparently to see his friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to [[Havana]], arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R. "The Circle and the Octagon: Maeda's Judo and Gracie's Jiu-jitsu." In Thomas A. Green and Joseph R. Svinth, eds. ''Martial Arts in the Modern World.'' Westport, Connecticut, 2003, pp. 61-70.</ref>

On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for [[Mexico City]]. His debut in Mexico City took place at the Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. His standing offer was 100 [[Mexican_peso|pesos]] (US $50) to anyone he could not throw, and 500 pesos (US $250) to anyone who could throw him.<ref>''Mexican Herald'', July 14, 1909.</ref> The ''Mexican Herald'' did not record anyone taking his money.

During September 1909, a Japanese calling himself Nobu Taka arrived in Mexico City for the purpose of challenging Maeda for what the ''Mexican Herald'' said would be the  world jujutsu championship.<ref>''Mexican Herald'', September 3, 1909.</ref> After several months of public wrangling, Taka and Maeda met at the Colon Theater on November 16, 1909; Taka won.<ref>''Mexican Herald'', November 16, 1909</ref> There was an immediate rematch, and four days later, Maeda was pronounced the champion.<ref>''Mexican Herald'', November 20, 1909.</ref> It was later revealed that Taka was none other than Maeda's old friend, Soishiro Satake.

In January 1910, Maeda took part in a wrestling tournament in Mexico City. During the semifinals, Maeda drew with Hjalmar Lundin.<ref>''Mexican Herald'', January 23, 1910.</ref> This is a different result than Lundin recalled in his 1937 memoirs.<ref>Lundin, Hjalmar. ''On the Mat -- and Off: Memoirs of a Wrestler''. New York: Albert Bonnier, 1937, p. 94.</ref> 

In July 1910, Maeda returned to Cuba, where he tried to arrange matches with [[Frank Gotch]] and [[Jack Johnson]]. Of course, the Americans ignored him -- there was no money to be made wrestling him, and much money to be lost if they lost to him.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R. "The Circle and the Octagon: Maeda's Judo and Gracie's Jiu-jitsu." In Thomas A. Green and Joseph R. Svinth, eds. ''Martial Arts in the Modern World.'' Westport, Connecticut, 2003, pp. 61-70.</ref> On August 23, 1910, Maeda wrestled Jack Connell in Havana; the result was a draw.<ref>''Mexican Herald'', August 23, 1910</ref>

During 1911, Maeda and Satake were joined in Cuba by Akitaro Ono and Tokugoro Ito. The four men were known as the Four Kings of Cuba.<ref name="stanlei7"/> 

The Four Kings were very popular in Cuba, and the Japanese were proud of the reputation they were bringing to judo and Japan.<ref>''Japan Times'', November 1, 1912 .</ref> Consequently, on January 8, 1912, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to fifth degree black belt. There was some resistance to this decision because not everyone in Japan approved of professional wrestling.<ref>"On the Defeat of Tokugoro in America," ''Judo,'' 5, 1916, pp. 85-86.[http://ejmas.com/jalt/2006jalt/jcsart_Svinth_0906.html]</ref>

In 1913, Ito Tokugoro stayed in Cuba while Maeda and Satake went to [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Honduras]], [[Panama]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while Maeda was there, and in Panama, the Americans tried to pay him to lose. So, they kept moving south. In Peru they met Laku, a Japanese jujutsuka that taught the military and invited him to join them. They were joined by Okura in [[Chile]], and by Shimitsu in [[Argentina]]. The troupe arrived in Brazil in November 14, 1914.<ref name="stanlei8">{{cite book

[[Image:Mitsuyo Maeda.gif|right|thumb|Mitsuyo Maeda]]
According to a Maeda passport copy provided by Gotta Tsutsumi, head of [[Belém]]'s ''Associação Paramazônica Nipako'', Maeda arrived in [[Porto Alegre]] on November 14, 1914,<ref name="eros">

Ito Tokugoro arrived sometime later. 

On December 20, 1915 took place the first demonstration in [[Belém]] at the Theatro Politheama. The ''O Tempo'' newspaper announced the event stating that Conde Koma would show the main ''jiu-jitsu'' techniques, discriminating the prohibited ones and would also demonstrate self-defense techniques; the troupe would be accepting challenges from the crowd, and there would happen the first ''sensational'' match of ''jiu-jitsu'' between Shimitsu (champion of Argentina) and Laku, Peruvian military professor.<ref name="stanlei10">{{cite book

On December 22, 1915 according to ''O Tempo'', ''jiu-jitsu'' world champion Maeda, head of the Japanese troupe and Satake, New York champion, performed an enthusiastic and sensational ''jiu-jitsu'' match. In the same day, Nagib Assef, an Australian Greco-Roman champion of Turkish origin, challenged Maeda. On December 24, 1915 Maeda defeated in seconds boxer Barbadiano Adolpho Corbiniano who became one of his disciples. On January 03, 1916 at Theatro Politheama, Maeda finally fought Nagib Assef who was thrown out of the stage and pinned into submission by arm-lock.<ref name="stanlei10" />

On January 08, 1916 Maeda, Okura and Shimitsu boarded the Antony and left to [[Liverpool]]. Ito Tokugoro went to Los Angeles.<ref>Svinth, Joseph R.

Of this last trip very little is known. Maeda went from England to Portugal, Spain and France coming back to Brazil in 1917 alone. Settling in [[Belém do Pará]] Maeda married D. May Iris.<ref name="stanlei10" />

Maeda was still cherished by the local population and recognized as a great fighter. Maeda slowed down and only fought sporadically. Around 1918-1919 Maeda accepted the challenge from famous [[Capoeira|Capoeirista]] (Capoeira fighter) ''Pé de Bola''. Maeda allowed ''Pé de Bola'' to use a knife in the fight. The ''Capoeirista'' was 1m 90cm tall and weighted 100kg. Maeda quickly finished the match.<ref name="stanlei11">{{cite book

In 1921 Maeda founded his first Judo academy at ''Clube Remo'' in a 4m x 4m shed. Later it was moved to the Fire Brigade headquarters and then to the church of ''N. S. de Aparecida''.

In 1925, Maeda became involved with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in [[Pará]], Brazil. This was part of a large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R.

Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to sixth dan, and on November 27, 1941, to seventh dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. Cause of death was kidney disease.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R. "The Circle and the Octagon: Maeda's Judo and Gracie's Jiu-jitsu." In Thomas A. Green and Joseph R.

In May 1956, a memorial to Maeda was erected in Hirosaki City, Japan. The dedication ceremony was attended by Risei Kano and Kaichiro Samura.<ref name="green">Green, Thomas A. and Svinth, Joseph R.

==His Influence on the Creation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu==
Since its inception, Judo was separated from Jiu-Jitsu in its goals, philosophy, and training regime. Although there was great rivalry among jujutsu teachers, this was more than just [[Jigoro Kano]]'s ambition to clearly individualize his art. Instead, to Kano, judo wasn't solely a martial art. Instead, it was also a sport, a method for promoting physical fitness and building character in young people, and, ultimately, a way ([[Tao]]) of life.<ref name="stanlei13">{{cite book

Outside Japan, however, this distinction wasn't even hinted. Both arts, jujutsu and judo, were practically unknown. Neither of them were recognized individually. Instead, they were considered the same thing. Even teachers of both arts didn't try too hard to make the distinction clear. For example, Tomita himself appeared in a book called ''Judo: The Modern School of Jiu-Jitsu''. In 1920, when Kano and Hikoishi Aida visited [[London]], they had little trouble convicing two British jujutsu teachers [[Yukio Tani]] and [[Gunji Koizumi]], to begin teaching Kodokan judo at their club, the [[Budokwai]].<ref>Bowen, Richard. "The Budokwai: Its Roots and Early History and Some Other Early Matters." The Budokwai. [http://www.budokwai.org/history_vol_i.htm]</ref> Other examples can be found. Thus, when Maeda and Satake arrived in Brazil, every newspaper announced ''jiu-jitsu'' despite both men being Kodokan Judoka. <ref name="stanlei13"/>

Gastão Gracie had established business in [[Pará]] eventually getting married in [[Belém]]. In 1917, his son [[Carlos Gracie]], still a 14 years old boy, watched a demonstration by Maeda at the ''Teatro da Paz'' and decided to learn jiu-jitsu. Maeda accepted to teach Carlos who would become a great exponent of the art and ultimately, with his younger brother [[Hélio  Gracie]] would be the founder of Gracie Jiu Jitsu, modern [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu]].<ref name="stanlei12">{{cite book

In 1921, Gastão Gracie and his family moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Carlos, then 17 years old, passed Maeda's teachings on to his brothers Osvaldo, Gastão and Jorge. Hélio was too young and sick at that time to learn the art, and due to medical imposition was prohibited to take part in the training sessions. Despite that, Hélio learned jiu-jitsu by watching his brothers and eventually overcome his health problems and is now considered the founder of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.<ref name="stanlei12" />

It is not known why Maeda chose to call his style of judo "jujutsu". One explanation is that Kodokan judo wasn't as famous in the 1920s as it is today, and that the traditional term for similar Japanese arts was jujutsu. (In Brazil, the transliteration was more often Jiu-Jitsu.) This explanation seems plausible, inasmuch as the Japanese government itself did not officially decide that the correct name for the martial art taught in the Japanese public schools should be "judo" rather than "jujutsu" until 1925.<ref>Motomura, Kiyoto.

==Legacy==

By sowing the seeds for Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Maeda is arguably one of the most influential judoka of modern times. His accomplishments across the globe as a judoka, catch wrestler, and prizefighter mark him as one of the early 20th century's most successful mixed martial artists. Furthermore, as a finalist in the world catch-wrestling champions who was reportedly unbeaten in judo bouts, he achieved what must be regarded as a phenomenal balance of success in those two sports. Whether or not another athlete has attained equal or greater accolades in both judo and wrestling is up for debate. Certainly, if such athletes exist, they are few in number.
