'''Saint Kitts and Nevis''', officially the '''Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis''' (or the '''Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis'''), located in the [[Leeward Islands]], is a unitary island nation in the [[Caribbean]] and the smallest nation in the Americas in both [[List of countries by area|area]] and [[List of countries by population|population]].  The capital city and government for the federated state is mainly on the larger island of [[Saint Kitts]] (''formerly named [[Saint Christopher]]''). The smaller state of [[Nevis]] (''formerly named: Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'') lies about 3 km southeast of Saint Kitts.  Historically the [[United Kingdom|British]] dependency of [[Anguilla]] was also a part of this union, which was then known collectively as [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]].

Although Saint Kitts and Nevis are geographically within the Leeward Islands, they are relatively close to a cluster of several other islands. To the north-northwest lie the islands of [[Saint Eustatius]], [[Saba]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], and [[Saint Martin]]. To the northeast are [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and to the south-east is [[Montserrat]].

Both the names Saint Christopher and Saint Kitts are given in the [http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Kitts/kitts83.html Constitution of Saint Christopher and Nevis].

==History==
{{main|History of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

Saint Kitts and Nevis has the distinction of being two of the Caribbean's oldest colonized territories. Saint Kitts specifically became the first ever British colony in the West Indies in 1624, and then became the first ever French colony in the Caribbean in 1625, when both nations decided to partition the island. Prior to European arrival, the island was settled by Neo-Indian peoples for over 5,000 years, with the latest arrivals, the [[Kalinago]] peoples, arriving approximately 3 centuries before the Europeans. It was the kindness of the Kalinago that allowed the Europeans to colonize Saint Kitts in the first place, as all earlier attempts to settle other islands was met with immediate destruction of the colonies by the Indians. The Kalinago were eventually completely wiped out on Saint Kitts in the great [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626]]. The island of Nevis was colonized in 1628 by British settlers from Saint Kitts. From there, Saint Kitts became the premier base for British and French expansion, as the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]] for the British, and [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[St. Barths]] for the French were colonized from it.

Although being tiny in size, and separated by only 2 miles of water (in the case of Saint Kitts and Nevis), the two islands were always viewed and governed as completely different states until the late 19th century, when they were forcefully unified along with the island of Anguilla by the British. An uneasy relationship followed to this day, with Nevis accusing Saint Kitts of neglecting its needs.

Saint Kitts and Nevis along with [[Anguilla]], became an associated state with full internal autonomy in 1967. Angullians rebelled, and their island was allowed to separate from the others in 1971. St. Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983. It is the newest sovereign nation of the Americas. In August 1998, a vote in Nevis on a referendum to separate from St. Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed. In late September 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] caused approximately $445 million in damages and limited [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth for the year.

[[Alexander Hamilton]], the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, was born on Nevis and spent his childhood there and on the island of [[St. Croix]].

==Politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Politics of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

The country is an independent [[Commonwealth Realm]] with Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]], represented in St. Kitts and Nevis by a [[List of Governors-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]], who acts on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Prime Minister]] and the Cabinet. The prime minister is the leader of the majority party of the House, and the cabinet conducts affairs of state.

St. Kitts and Nevis has a [[unicameral]] legislature, known as the [[National Assembly of Saint Kitts and Nevis|National Assembly]]. It is comprised of 14 members - 11 elected Representatives, three of whom are from the island of [[Nevis]] - and three Senators who are appointed by the [[Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]]. Two of the senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, and one on the advice of the leader of the opposition. Unlike in other countries, Senators do not constitute a separate [[Senate]] or [[upper house]] of parliament, but sit in the National Assembly, alongside Representatives. All members serve five-year terms. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament.

Saint Kitts and Nevis is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

==Geography==
[[Image:Sc-map.png|thumb|Map of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]
{{main|Geography of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

The country has two main islands, [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]]. The highest peak is [[Mount Liamuiga]], which tops at 1 156 m.

The islands are of [[volcanic]] origin, with large central peaks covered in jungle; the steep slopes leading to these peaks are mostly uninhabited.  The vast majority of the population on both islands live close to the sea where the terrain flattens out.  There are numerous [[rivers]] descending from the mountains of both islands, which provide fresh water to the local population.  St. Kitts also has one very small [[lake]].

[[image:800px-Stkitts-view-lookingatsea.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[help:contents|Salt Ponds Overlooking Nevis]]]]

Saint Kitts and Nevis was the last sugar [[monoculture]] in the [[Eastern Caribbean]]. Faced with a sugar industry that was finding it increasingly difficult to earn a profit, the government embarked on a program to diversify the [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector and stimulate the development of other sectors of the economy.

In mid-2005, the sugar economy in St. Kitts was finally shut down by the government, after running continuous losses for many years.  The primary industry remains tourism.
