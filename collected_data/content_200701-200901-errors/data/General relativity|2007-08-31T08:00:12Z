'''General relativity''' (GR) (aka '''general theory of relativity''' (GTR)) is the [[Geometry|geometrical]] [[theory]] of [[gravitation]] published by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915/16.<ref name=Ein1915>{{cite journal|last=Einstein| first=Albert| authorlink = Albert Einstein| date=[[November 25]], [[1915]]| title=Die Feldgleichungun der Gravitation| journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin| pages=844-847 | url=http://nausikaa2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.x.cgi?dir=6E3MAXK4&step=thumb | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref><ref name = Ein1916> {{cite journal| last = Einstein| first = Albert| title = The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity| journal = Annalen der Physik| volume = | issue = | pages = | date = 1916| publisher = | url = http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html| format = [[PDF]]| id =  | accessdate = 2006-09-03 }} </ref> It unifies [[special relativity]], [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], and the insight that gravitational [[acceleration]] can be described by the [[curvature]] of [[space]] and [[time]]. General relativity further calls for the curvature of [[space-time]] to be produced by the [[mass]]-[[energy]] and [[momentum]] content of the matter in space-time. General relativity is distinguished from other metric [[:Category:Theories of gravitation|theories of gravitation]] by its use of the [[Einstein field equations]] to relate space-time content and space-time curvature.

General relativity is currently the most successful gravitational theory, being almost universally accepted and well-supported by observations. The first success of general relativity was in explaining the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous perihelion precession]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Then in 1919, [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Sir Arthur Eddington]] announced that observations of [[star]]s near the [[eclipse]]d [[Sun]] confirmed general relativity's prediction that massive objects bend [[light]]. Since then, many other [[tests of general relativity|observations and experiments]] have confirmed many of the [[#Predictions|predictions of general relativity]], including [[gravitational time dilation]], the [[gravitational redshift]] of light, [[Shapiro delay|signal delay]], and [[gravitational radiation]]. In addition, numerous observations are interpreted as confirming one of general relativity's most mysterious and exotic predictions, the existence of [[black hole]]s.

In the [[mathematics of general relativity|mathematical formalism of general relativity]], the Einstein field equations are a system of [[partial differential equations]] whose solution represents the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] (or the metric) of space-time, describing its "shape". Some important [[solutions of the Einstein field equations]] are the [[Schwarzschild solution]] (for the space-time surrounding a spherically symmetric uncharged and non-rotating massive object), the [[Reissner-Nordström black hole|Reissner-Nordström solution]] (for a charged spherically symmetric massive object), and the [[Kerr metric]] (for a rotating massive object).  An object moving [[inertia]]lly in a gravitational field follows a [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic path]] that may be found using the [[Christoffel symbol]] of the metric.

In spite of its overwhelming success, there is discomfort with general relativity in the scientific community due to its being incompatible with [[quantum mechanics]] and the reachable [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] of black holes (at which the mathematics of general relativity breaks down). Because of this, numerous other theories have been proposed as [[alternatives to general relativity]]. An early and still-popular class of modifications is [[Brans-Dicke theory]], which, although not solving the problems of singularities and quantum gravity, appeared to have observational support in the 1960s. However, those observations have since been refuted and modern measurements indicate that any Brans-Dicke type of deviation from general relativity must be very small if it exists at all.

==Justification==
{{main|Equivalence principle}}
[[Image:Elevator gravity2.png|thumb|left|250px|Ball falling to the floor in an accelerated rocket (left) and on [[Earth]] (right)]]
The justification for creating general relativity came from the [[equivalence principle]], which dictates that [[free-fall]]ing observers are the ones in [[inertia]]l motion. Roughly speaking, the principle states that the most obvious effect of gravity – things falling down – can be eliminated by making the transition to a reference frame that is in free fall, and that in such a reference frame, the laws of physics will be approximately the same as in special relativity.<ref>While the equivalence principle is still part of modern expositions of general relativity, there are some differences between the modern version and Einstein's original concept, cf. Norton 1985.</ref> A consequence of this insight is that inertial observers can accelerate with respect to each other. For example, a person in [[free fall]] in an elevator whose cable has been cut will experience weightlessness: objects will either float alongside him or her, or drift at constant speed. In this way, the experiences of an observer in free fall will be very similar to those of an observer in deep space, far away from any source of gravity, and in fact to those of the privileged ("inertial") observers in Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]].<ref>This is described in detail in chapter 2 of Wheeler 1990.</ref>  Einstein realized that the close connection between weightlessness and special relativity represented a fundamental property of gravity. 

Einstein's key insight was that there is no fundamental difference between the constant pull of gravity we know from everyday experience and the [[fictitious forces]] felt by an accelerating observer (in the language of physics: an observer in a [[non-inertial reference frame]]).<ref name="Einstein:1907">{{cite journal|last=Einstein| first=Albert| date=1907| title=Über das Relativitätsprinzip und die aus demselben gezogene Folgerungen| journal=Jahrbuch der Radioaktivitaet und Elektronik | volume = 4}}</ref><ref>E. g. Janssen (2005), p. 64f. Einstein himself also explains this in section XX of his non-technical book Einstein 1961. Following earlier ideas by [[Ernst Mach]], Einstein also explored [[centrifugal force]]s and their gravitational analogue, cf. Stachel 1989.</ref> So what people standing on the surface of the Earth perceive as the 'force of gravity' is a result of their undergoing a continuous physical acceleration which could just as easily be imitated by placing an observer within a rocket accelerating at the same rate as gravity (9.81 [[metre per second squared|m/s²]]).

This redefinition is incompatible with [[Newton's first law of motion]], and cannot be accounted for in the [[Euclidean geometry]] of [[special relativity]]. To quote Einstein himself:
{{cquote|If all accelerated systems are equivalent, then Euclidean geometry cannot hold in all of them."'' <ref> See [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/General_relativity.html http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/General_relativity.html]</ref>}}
Thus the equivalence principle led Einstein to develop a gravitational theory which involves curved space-times. Paraphrasing [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], Einstein's geometric theory of gravity can be summarized thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.<ref>E.g. p. xi in Wheeler 1990.</ref>

Another motivating factor was the realization that relativity calls for the gravitational potential to be expressed as a symmetric rank-two [[tensor]], and not just a [[scalar field|scalar]] as was the case in Newtonian physics (An analogy is the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] of special relativity). Thus, Einstein sought a rank-two tensor means of describing curved space-times surrounding massive objects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Einstein| first=Albert| coauthors = Grossmann, Marcel| date= 1913| title=Entwurf einer verallgemeinerten Relativitaetstheorie und einer Theorie der Gravitation| journal=Zeitschrift fuer Mathematik und Physik| pages=225-261| url=http://www.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~suchii/gen.GR3.html | accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> This effort came to fruition with the discovery of the Einstein field equations in 1915.<ref name=Ein1915/>

==Fundamental principles==
[[Image:spacetime curvature.png|thumb|right|300px|Two-dimensional analogy of space-time distortion. The presence of matter changes the geometry of [[spacetime]], this (curved) geometry being interpreted as [[gravity]]. Note that the white lines do not represent the curvature of space, but instead represent the [[coordinate system]] imposed on the curved spacetime which would be [[rectilinear]] in a flat spacetime]]
One of the defining features of general relativity is the idea that gravitational 'force' is replaced by geometry. Phenomena that in [[classical mechanics]] are ascribed to the action of the force of [[gravity]] (such as [[free-fall]], [[orbit]]al motion, and [[spacecraft]] [[trajectories]]) are taken in general relativity to represent inertial motion within a curved geometry of [[spacetime]].

In this theory, [[spacetime]] is treated as a 4-dimensional [[Lorentzian manifold]] which is curved by the presence of [[mass]], [[energy]] and [[momentum]] (or [[stress-energy tensor|stress-energy]]) within it. The relationship between stress-energy and the curvature of spacetime is described by the [[Einstein field equations]]. The motion of objects being influenced solely by the geometry of spacetime ([[Inertia|inertial motion]]) occurs along special paths called [[timelike]] and [[null]] [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesics]] of spacetime.<ref name = Ein1916/><ref>{{cite book | last = Einstein | first = A. | title = Relativity: The Special and General Theory | location = New York | publisher = Crown | year = 1961 | id = ISBN 0-517-02961-8 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5001 }}</ref> 

General relativity is predicated upon several underlying assumptions. The [[general principle of relativity]] states that the laws of physics must be the same for all observers (accelerated or not). The [[principle of general covariance]] states the laws of physics must take the same form in all coordinate systems. General relativity also requires equivalence between [[inertia]]l and [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic motion]] because the world lines of particles unaffected by physical forces are timelike or null geodesics of spacetime.  The [[local Lorentz invariance]] requires that the laws of [[special relativity]] apply locally for all inertial observers. The curvature of spacetime is created by stress-energy within the spacetime as described by the Einstein field equations. Moreover, this curvature permits gravitational effects to be described as a form of inertial motion. The equivalence principle, which was the starting point for the [[history of general relativity|development of general relativity]], ended up being a consequence of the general principle of relativity and the principle that inertial motion is geodesic motion.

==Mathematical framework==
{{main|Mathematics of general relativity}}
{{see also|Physical theories modified by general relativity}}

The requirements of the mathematics of general relativity are further modified by the other principles. Local Lorentz Invariance requires that the manifolds described in GR be 4-dimensional and Lorentzian instead of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]. In addition, the principle of [[general covariance]] forces that mathematics to be expressed using [[tensor calculus]]. Tensor calculus permits a manifold as [[map]]ped with a [[coordinate system]] to be equipped with a [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor of spacetime]] which describes the incremental (spacetime) intervals between coordinates from which both the [[geodesic equation]]s of motion and the [[curvature tensor]] of the spacetime can be ascertained.

===Geometry===
[[Image:Earth geo.gif|thumb|right|250px|Converging geodesics: two lines of longitude (green) that start out in parallel at the equator (red) but converge to meet at the pole]]
Due to the expectation that spacetime is curved, non-Euclidean geometry must be used.  (In particular, the geometry is described by a [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] metric, or more specifically still, a Lorentzian metric.)  In essence, spacetime does not adhere to the "common sense" rules of Euclidean geometry, but instead objects that were initially traveling in parallel paths through spacetime (meaning that their velocities do not differ to first order in their separation) come to travel in a non-parallel fashion. This effect is called [[geodesic deviation]], and it is used in general relativity as an alternative to gravity. For example, two people on the Earth heading due north from different positions on the [[equator]] are initially traveling on parallel paths, yet at the [[north pole]] those paths will cross. Similarly, two balls initially at rest with respect to and above the surface of the Earth (which are parallel paths by virtue of being at rest with respect to each other) come to have a converging component of relative velocity as both accelerate towards the center of the Earth due to their subsequent free-fall.

[[Image:Tide fall.png|thumb|right|150px|Two bodies falling towards the center of the Earth accelerate towards each other as they fall.]]
The curvature of spacetime (caused by the presence of stress-energy) can be viewed intuitively in the following way. Placing a heavy object such as a bowling ball on a trampoline will produce a 'dent' in the trampoline. This is analogous to a large mass such as the Earth causing the local spacetime geometry to curve. This is represented by the image at the top of this article. The larger the mass, the bigger the amount of curvature. A relatively light object placed in the vicinity of the 'dent', such as a ping-pong ball, will accelerate towards the bowling ball in a manner governed by the 'dent'. Firing the ping-pong ball at some suitable combination of direction and speed towards the 'dent' will result in the ping-pong ball 'orbiting' the bowling ball. This is analogous to the Moon orbiting the Earth, for example.

Similarly, in general relativity massive objects do not directly impart a force on other massive objects as hypothesized in Newton's [[action at a distance]] idea. Instead (in a manner analogous to the ping-pong ball's response to the bowling ball's ''dent'' rather than the bowling ball itself), other massive objects respond to how the first massive object curves spacetime. Notice that the most important part of the curvature near a massive object is in the plane defined by the ''time'' and ''radial'' directions, although there is also some purely spatial curvature.

===Coordinate vs. physical acceleration===
One of the greatest sources of confusion about general relativity comes from the need to distinguish between coordinate and physical accelerations.

In [[classical mechanics]], space is preferentially mapped with a [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. Inertial motion then occurs as one moves through this space at a constant coordinate rate with respect to time. Any change in this rate of progression must be due to a force, and therefore a physical and coordinate acceleration were in classical mechanics one and the same. It is important to note that in [[special relativity]] that same kind of Cartesian coordinate system was used, with time being added as a fourth dimension and defined for an observer using the [[Einstein synchronisation|Einstein synchronization procedure]]. As a result, physical and coordinate acceleration correspond in special relativity too, although their magnitudes may vary.

In general relativity, the elegance of a flat spacetime and the ability to use a preferred coordinate system are lost (due to stress-energy curving spacetime and the principle of [[general covariance]]). Consequently, coordinate and physical accelerations become sundered. In the case of someone standing on the Earth, where they are at rest with respect to the surface coordinates for the Earth (latitude, longitude, and elevation) but are undergoing a continuous physical acceleration because the mechanical resistance of the Earth's surface keeps them from free-falling. <!--Better example needed. For example: Try using a [[polar coordinate system]] in classical mechanics.  In this case, an inertially moving object which passes by (instead of through) the origin point is found to first be moving mostly inwards, then to be moving tangentially with respect to the origin, and finally to be moving outwards, and yet it is moving in a straight line. This is an example of an inertially moving object undergoing a coordinate acceleration, and the way this coordinate acceleration changes as the object travels is given by the [[geodesic]] equations for the manifold and coordinate system in use.-->

===Einstein field equations===
{{main|Einstein field equations}}

The Einstein field equations (EFE) describe how stress-energy causes curvature of spacetime and are usually written in [[tensor]] form (using [[abstract index notation]]) as

:<math> G_{ab} = \kappa\, T_{ab} </math>

where ''G<sub>ab</sub>'' is the [[Einstein tensor]], ''T<sub>ab</sub>'' is the [[stress-energy tensor]] and <math>\kappa </math> is a constant. The Einstein tensor is related to the curvature of space-time and is a function only of the metric tensor and its first and second derivatives. The stress energy tensor, which is the source of the gravitational field, includes stress (pressure and shear), the density of momentum, and the density of energy including the energy of mass (the source for Newtonian gravity). The tensors ''G<sub>ab</sub>'' and ''T<sub>ab</sub>'' are both rank-2 symmetric tensors, that is, they can each be thought of as 4×4 matrices, each of which contains 10 independent terms.

The EFE reduce to [[Newton's law of gravity]] in the [[Correspondence principle#Other uses of the term|limiting cases]] of a [[weak-field approximation|weak gravitational field]] and [[slow-motion approximation|slow speed]] relative to the speed of light. In fact, the value of <math>\kappa</math> in the EFE is determined to be <math>\kappa = 8 \pi G / c^4 \ </math> by making these two approximations.<ref name = Ein1916/>

The [[solutions of the Einstein field equations|solutions of the EFE]] are [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metrics of spacetime]]. These metrics describe the structure of spacetime given the stress-energy and coordinate mapping used to obtain that solution. Being non-linear differential equations, the EFE often defy attempts to obtain an [[exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]]; however, many such solutions are known.

The EFE are the identifying feature of general relativity. Other theories built out of the same premises include additional rules and/or constraints. The result almost invariably is a theory with different [[field equation]]s (such as [[Brans-Dicke theory]], [[teleparallelism]], [[Rosen's bimetric theory]], and [[Einstein-Cartan theory]]).

===Gravitational effects===
====Gravitational redshifting====
[[Image:Gravitational red-shifting2.png|thumb|left|200px|The gravitational redshift of a light wave escaping from the surface of a massive body]]
The first of these effects is the [[gravitational redshift]]ing of [[light]]. Under this effect, the frequency of light will decrease (shifting visible light towards the red end of the spectrum) as it moves to higher gravitational potentials (out of a gravity well). 

Assume that there are two observers, both of them at rest relative to a massive body. When the observer closer to the massive object sends some light to a second observer that is at rest higher up, the light will be [[red-shift]]ed; the second observer will measure a lower [[frequency]] for the light than the first. Conversely, light sent from the second observer to the first will be [[blue-shift]]ed (shifted towards higher frequencies).<ref>This effect can be derived directly within special relativity, either by looking at the equivalent situation of two observers in an accelerated rocket-ship or by looking at a falling elevator; in both situations, the frequency shift has an equivalent description as a [[Doppler shift]] between certain inertial frames.
For simple derivations of this, see Harrison 2002.</ref> This is caused by an observer at a higher gravitational potential being accelerated (with respect to the local inertial frames of reference) away from the source of a beam of light as that light is moving towards that observer. Gravitational redshifting has been confirmed by the [[Pound-Rebka experiment]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pound| first=R. V.| coauthors = G. A.

====Gravitational time dilation====
A related effect is [[gravitational time dilation]], under which clocks will run slower at lower gravitational potentials (deeper within a gravity well). For the same light wave, the second observer measures a lower frequency than the first; evidently, the second observer's clocks are running faster than those of the first observer. The same effect can also be derived in other ways (notably by transporting clocks back and forth and reconstructing the effect of location on their tick rate). Generally, clocks that are further down in a gravitational field tick more slowly than those that are higher up.<ref>See chapter 12 of Mermin 2005.</ref> This effect has been directly confirmed by the [[Hafele-Keating experiment]]<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hafele | first= J. | coauthors = Keating, R. | authorlink = | date= [[July 14]] [[1972]]| title=Around the world atomic clocks:predicted relativistic time gains | journal=Science| volume = 177 | issue = 4044| pages=166-168| url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/177/4044/166| doi = 10.1126/science.177.4044.166| accessdate= 2006-09-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Hafele | first= J. | coauthors = Keating, R. | authorlink = | date= July 14 1972| title=Around the world atomic clocks:observed relativistic time gains | journal=Science| volume = 177 | issue = 4044| pages=168-170| url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/177/4044/168 | doi = 10.1126/science.177.4044.168| accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]].

Gravitational time dilation has as a consequence another effect called the [[Shapiro effect]] (also known as gravitational time delay). Shapiro delay occurs when signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of the gravitational field. This effect was discovered through the observations of signals from spacecraft and pulsars passing behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Shapiro | first= I.

====Gravitational lensing====
{{main|Gravitational lensing}}
[[Image:Einstein ring.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Einstein cross]]: four images of the same astronomical object, produced by a [[gravitational lens]]]]
Gravitational lensing occurs when one distant object is in front of or close to being in front of another much more distant object.  In that case, the bending of light by the nearer object can change how the more distant object is seen. The first example of gravitational lensing was the discovery of a case of two nearby images of the same pulsar.  Since then many other examples of distant galaxies and quasars being affected by gravitational lensing have been found.

In a similar way, Einstein also derived another effect, the gravitational deflection of light where light rays are bent downward in a gravitational field. An important example of this is starlight being deflected as it passes the [[Sun]]; in consequence, the positions of stars observed in the Sun's vicinity during a [[solar eclipse]] appear shifted by up to 1.75 [[arc second]]s. This effect was first measured by a British expedition directed by [[Arthur Eddington]]. Subsequent observations of the deflection of the light of distant [[quasar]]s by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of [[radio astronomy]], have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly higher accuracy.<ref>See Kennefick 2005 and, for the most precise measurements to date, Bertotti 2005.</ref><ref>In contrast to the derivation of frequency shift and time dilation, this calculation leads to a slightly different result when repeated in the full theory of general relativity, cf. Ehlers & Rindler 1997; for a non-technical presentation, see Pössel 2007.</ref> 

A special type of gravitational lensing occurs in [[Einstein ring]]s and arcs. The Einstein ring is created when an object is directly behind another object with a uniform gravitational field. In that case, the light from the more distant object becomes a ring around the closer object.  If the more distant object is slightly offset to one side and/or the gravitational field is not uniform, partial rings (called arcs) will appear instead.

Finally, in our own galaxy a star can appear to be brightened when compact massive foreground object is sufficiently aligned with it. In that case, the magnified and distorted images of the background star due to the gravitational bending of light cannot be resolved. This effect is called [[microlensing]], and such events are now regularly observed.

Gravitational lensing has developed into a tool of [[observational astronomy]], where it is used (among other things) to determine the [[mass]]es of certain objects, detect the presence of [[dark matter]], and provide an independent estimate of the [[Hubble constant]].<ref>Introductions to gravitational lensing can be found on the webpages Newbury 1997 and Lochner 2007.</ref>

====Orbital effects====
[[Image:Relativistic precession.svg|thumb|left|200px|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star]]
{{Main|Kepler problem in general relativity}}
General relativity differs from classical mechanics in its predictions for orbiting bodies. The first difference is in the prediction that [[Apsis|apsides]] of [[orbit]]s will [[precess]] on their own. This is not called for by Newton's theory of gravity. Because of this, an early successful test of general relativity was its correctly predicting the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous perihelion precession]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. More recently, perihelion precession has been confirmed in the large precessions observed in [[binary pulsar]] systems.

A related effect is [[geodetic effect|geodetic precession]]. This is a precession of the poles of a spinning object due to the effects of [[parallel transport]] in a curved space-time. This effect is not expected in Newtonian gravity. The prediction of geodetic precession was tested and verified by the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment to a precision of better than 1 percent<ref>http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/press_releases/SU/pr-aps-041807.pdf</ref>.

Another effect is that of orbital decay due to the emission of [[gravitational radiation]] by a co-rotating system. It is observable in closely orbiting stars as an ongoing decrease in their orbital period. This effect has been observed in binary pulsar systems.

====Frame dragging====
{{main|Frame dragging}}
Frame dragging is where a rotating massive object "drags" space-time along with its rotation. In essence, an observer who is distant from a rotating massive object and at rest with respect to its center of mass will find that the fastest clocks at a given distance from the object are not those which are at rest (as is the case for a non-rotating massive object). Instead, the fastest clocks will be found to have component of motion around the rotating object in the direction of the rotation. Similarly, it will be found by the distant observer that light moves faster in the direction of the rotation of the object than against it. Frame dragging will also cause the orientation of a gyroscope to change over time. For a spacecraft in a polar orbit, the direction of this effect is perpendicular to the geodetic precession mentioned [[#geodetic precess|above]]. [[Gravity Probe B]] is using this feature to test both frame dragging and the geodetic precession predictions.

====Black holes====
{{main|Black hole}}
[[Image:Rotating Black Hole.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An illustration of a rotating black hole at the center of a galaxy]]
When mass is concentrated into a sufficiently compact region of space, general relativity predicts the formation of a [[black hole]] – a region of space with a gravitational attraction so strong that not even light can escape. 

The disappearance of light and matter within a black hole may be thought of as their entering a region where all possible world lines point inwards. [[Stephen Hawking]] has predicted that black holes can "leak" mass,<ref> {{cite journal | last = Hawking | first = Stephen | authorlink = Stephen Hawking | title = Particle creation by black holes| journal = Communications in Mathematical Physics | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 199-220 | date = 1975 | publisher = | url = http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.cmp/1103899181| id = | accessdate = 2006-09-17 }} </ref> a phenomenon called [[Hawking radiation]], a quantum effect not in violation of general relativity. Certain types of black holes are thought to be the final state in the [[stellar evolution|evolution]] of massive [[stars]]. [[Supermassive black hole]]s are thought to be present in the cores of most [[galaxy|galaxies]], and are thought to play a key role in galactic evolution. Numerous black hole candidates are known. These include the supermassive object associated with [[Sagittarius A*]] at the [[Galactic center|center of our galaxy]]<ref>See [http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php the Max Plank Institute page on stars orbiting the galaxy's central object].</ref>

Matter falling onto a compact object is one of the most efficient mechanisms for releasing [[energy]] in the form of [[radiation]], and matter falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable, such as [[quasars]] and other types of [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]].<ref>For an overview of the history of black hole physics from its beginnings in the early twentieth century to modern times, see the very readable account by Thorne 1994.</ref>

===Cosmology===
{{main|Physical cosmology}}
Although it was created as a theory of gravitation, it was soon realized that general relativity could be used to model the [[universe]], and so gave birth to the field of [[physical cosmology]]. The central equations for physical cosmology are the [[Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric]], which are the cosmological solution of the Einstein field equations. This metric predicts that the universe must be dynamic: It must either be expanding, contracting, or switching between those states.

At the time of the discovery of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, Einstein was under the mistaken impression that a static universe was required by astronomical observations. In an attempt to make general relativity accommodate a static universe, Einstein introduced an alternative form of the field equations to accommodate a [[Einstein static universe|static universe solution]] in his theory:{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

:<math> G_{ab} + \Lambda\ g_{ab} = \kappa\, T_{ab} </math>

where <math>\Lambda </math> is the [[cosmological constant]] and ''g<sub>ab</sub>''  is the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|spacetime metric]].

However, the resultant static universe was unstable. Then in 1929 [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that the [[redshift]]ing of light from distant galaxies indicates that they are receding from our own at a rate which is proportional to their distance from us.<ref> {{cite journal| last = Hubble| first = Edwin| authorlink = Edwin Hubble| coauthors = | title = A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA| volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 168-173| date = [[1929-01-17]]| publisher = | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/168| format = [[PDF]]| id = | accessdate = 2006-09-06 }} </ref> <ref>{{cite web| last = Hubble| first = Edwin| authorlink = Edwin Hubble| title = A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae | work = | publisher = | date = [[1929-01-17]]| url = http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/1996/hub_1929.html| format =| doi = | accessdate = 2006-11-03 }}</ref>. This demonstrated that the universe is indeed expanding. Hubble's discovery ended Einstein's objections and his use of the cosmological constant.

The equations for an expanding universe become [[singularity|singular]] when one goes far enough back in time, and this primordial singularity marks the formation of the universe. That event has come to be called the [[Big Bang]]. In 1948, [[Ralph Asher Alpher]] and [[George Gamov]] published an article describing this event and predicting the existence of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] left over from the Big Bang. In 1965, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] first observed the background radiation.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Penzias| first = Arno| authorlink = | coauthors = Wilson, R.

{{unsolved|physics|What is dark matter? Do the phenomena attributed to dark matter point not to some form of matter but actually to an extension of gravity?}}
Recently, observations of distant [[supernova]]e have indicated that the expansion of the universe is currently [[deceleration parameter|accelerating]]. This was unexpected since Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric calls for a universe that only contains visible matter to have a decelerating expansion. In the modern cosmological models, most energy in the universe is in forms that have never been detected directly, namely [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]]. However, for a universe that is 4% [[baryon]]ic matter, 26% [[dark matter]], and 70% [[dark energy]], the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric takes on a form that is consistent with observation. There is also an irony in that the dark energy can be modeled using Einstein's cosmological constant, but with a value that enhances the dynamic nature of the universe instead of muting it.{{Facts|date=February 2007}} There have been several (controversial) proposals to obviate the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy by modifying the laws governing gravitation and the dynamics of [[cosmic expansion]] (for example, [[modified Newtonian dynamics]]).<ref>For dark matter, see Milgrom 2002; for dark energy, Caldwell 2004.</ref>

===Other predictions===
[[Image:Star collapse to black hole.png|thumb|250px|left|Simulation based on the equations of general relativity: a star collapsing to form a black hole while emitting gravitational waves]]
General relativity predicts the equivalence of inertial mass and gravitational mass. A number of other tests have probed the validity of various versions of the [[equivalence principle]] (strictly speaking, all measurements of gravitational time dilation are tests of the [[weak equivalence principle|weak]] version of that principle, not of general relativity itself). As embodied by the [[strong equivalence principle]], even a self-gravitating object will respond to an external gravitational field in the same manner as a test particle would. (This is often violated by [[#Alternative theories|alternative theories]].)

General relativity also predicts that [[quadrupole]] and higher order [[multipole]] oscillations of the stress-energy tensor will produce [[gravitational radiation]]. As gravitation is substantially weaker than the other [[fundamental interaction]]s, currently only extremely violent events (like merging neutron stars and/or black holes) are expected to emit a detectable amount of radiation. A number of land-based [[gravitational wave detector]]s are in operation, with the aim of detecting gravitational waves directly. None have yet been detected, but some binary stars appear to be suffering orbital decay as a result of gravitational radiation carrying away energy. Although general relativity, not being a quantized theory, does not predict [[gravitons]] (quanta of gravitational radiation) as such, it is generally believed that if gravitational radiation exists, then it must consist of gravitons.

==Relationship with quantum mechanics==
[[Quantum mechanics]] is viewed as a fundamental theory of physics along with general relativity, but combining the two theories has presented many difficulties.

===Quantum field theory in curved spacetime===
:{{main|Quantum field theory in curved spacetime}}
Normally, [[quantum field theory]] models are considered in flat [[Minkowski space]] (or [[Euclidean space]]), which is an excellent approximation for weak gravitational fields like those on Earth. In the presence of strong gravitational fields, the principles of quantum field theory have to be modified. The [[spacetime]] is static so the theory is not fully relativistic in the sense of general relativity; it is neither [[background independent]] nor [[general covariance|generally covariant]] under the diffeomorphism group. The interpretation of excitations of quantum fields as particles becomes frame dependent. [[Hawking radiation]] is a prediction of this semiclassical approximation.

===Einstein gravity is nonrenormalizable===
{{unsolved|physics|How can the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] be merged with the theory of general relativity to produce a so-called "[[theory of everything]]"?}}

It is often said that general relativity is incompatible with [[quantum mechanics]]. This means that if one attempts to treat the gravitational field using the ordinary rules of [[quantum field theory]], one finds that physical quantities are divergent. Such [[Ultraviolet divergence|divergences]] are common in quantum field theories, and can be cured by adding parameters to the theory known as [[counterterms]]. These counterterms are infinities which are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the divergent terms. When they are added, the infinities cancel, leaving only finite terms, but modifying the meaning of terms in the equation such as "mass" and "charge" {{Facts|date=February 2007}}.

Many of the best understood [[quantum]] field theories, such as [[quantum electrodynamics]], contain divergences which are canceled by counterterms that have been effectively measured. One needs to say ''effectively'' because the counterterms are formally infinite, however it suffices to measure observable quantities, such as physical particle masses and coupling constants, which depend on the counterterms in such a way that the various infinities cancel.

A problem arises, however, when the cancellation of all infinities requires the inclusion of an infinite number of counterterms. In this case the theory is said to be [[nonrenormalizable]]. While nonrenormalizable theories are sometimes seen as problematic, the framework of [[effective field theory|effective field theories ]] presents a way to get low-energy predictions out of non-renormalizable theories. The result is a theory that works correctly at low energies, though such a theory cannot be considered to be a [[theory of everything]] because it cannot be self-consistently extended to the high-energy realm.

===Proposed quantum gravity theories===
General relativity fits nicely into the effective field theory formalism and makes sensible predictions at low energies.<ref>{{cite web | author = Donoghue, John F.| title=Introduction to the Effective Field Theory Description of Gravity | date= 1995 | url=http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9512024 | accessdate=2006-08-26}} Lectures presented at the Advanced School on Effective Field Theories (Almunecar, Spain, June 1995), to be published in the proceedings.</ref> However, high enough energies will "break" the theory.

It is generally held that one of the most important unsolved problems in modern physics is the problem of obtaining the [[theory of everything|true quantum theory of gravitation]], that is, the theory chosen by nature, one that will work at all energies. Discarded attempts at obtaining such theories include [[supergravity]], a [[field theory]] which unifies general relativity with [[supersymmetry]]. In the [[second superstring revolution]], supergravity has come back into fashion, with its quantum completion rebranded with a new name: [[M-theory]].

A very different approach to that described above is employed by [[loop quantum gravity]]. In this approach, one does not try to quantize the gravitational field as one quantizes other fields in quantum field theories. Thus the theory is not plagued with divergences and one does not need counterterms. However it has not been demonstrated that the classical limit of loop quantum gravity does in fact contain flat space Einsteinian gravity. This being said, the universe has only one spacetime and it is not flat.

Of these two proposals, M-theory is significantly more ambitious in that it also attempts to incorporate the other known [[fundamental force]]s of Nature, whereas loop quantum gravity "merely" attempts to provide a viable quantum theory of gravitation with a well-defined [[classical limit]] which agrees with general relativity.

==Alternative theories==
{{Main|Alternatives to general relativity}}
Well known [[classical theories of gravitation]] other than general relativity include:
*[[Nordström's theory of gravitation]] (1913) was one of the earliest ''metric theories'' (an aspect brought out by Einstein and Fokker in 1914). Nordström soon abandoned his theory in favor of general relativity on theoretical grounds, but this theory, which is a ''scalar theory'', and which features a notion of ''prior geometry'', does not predict any ''light bending'', so it is solidly incompatible with observation.
*[[Alfred North Whitehead]] formulated an alternative theory of gravity that was regarded as a viable contender for several decades, until [[Clifford Martin Will|Clifford Will]] noticed in 1971 that it predicts grossly incorrect behavior for the ocean tides.
*[[George David Birkhoff]]'s (1943) yields the same predictions for the classical four solar system tests as general relativity, but unfortunately requires sound waves to travel at the speed of light. Thus, like Whitehead's theory, it was never a viable theory after all, despite making an initially good impression on many experts.
*Like Nordström's theory, the gravitation theory of [[Wei-Tou Ni]] (1971) features a notion of prior geometry, but Will soon showed that it is not fully compatible with observation and experiment.
*The [[Brans-Dicke theory]] and the [[bimetric theory|Rosen bimetric theory]] are two alternatives to general relativity which have been around for a very long time and which have also withstood many tests. However, they are less elegant and more complicated than general relativity, in several senses.
*There have been many attempts to formulate consistent theories which combine gravity and electromagnetism. The first of these, [[Weyl's gauge theory of gravitation]], was immediately shot down (on a postcard) by Einstein himself,{{Fact|date=February 2007}} who pointed out to [[Hermann Weyl]] that in his theory, hydrogen atoms would have variable size, which they do not. Another early attempt, the original [[Kaluza-Klein theory]], at first seemed to unify general relativity with classical electromagnetism, but is no longer regarded as successful for that purpose. Both these theories have turned out to be historically important for other reasons: Weyl's idea of [[gauge invariance]] survived and in fact is omnipresent in modern physics, while Kaluza's idea of compact extra dimensions has been resurrected in the modern notion of a [[Brane cosmology|braneworld]].
*The [[Fierz-Pauli spin-two theory]] was an optimistic attempt to quantize general relativity, but it turns out to be internally inconsistent. [[Pascual Jordan]]'s work toward fixing these problems eventually motivated the Brans-Dicke theory, and also influenced [[Richard Feynman]]'s unsuccessful attempts to quantize gravity.
*[[Einstein-Cartan theory]] includes [[torsion]] terms, so it is not a metric theory in the strict sense.
*[[Teleparallel gravity]] goes further and replaces connections with nonzero curvature (but vanishing torsion) by ones with nonzero torsion (but vanishing curvature).
*The [[Nonsymmetric Gravitational Theory]] (NGT) of [[John Moffat|John W. Moffat]] is a dark horse in the race.

Even for "weak field" observations confined to our Solar system, various alternative theories of gravity predict quantitatively distinct deviations from Newtonian gravity. In the weak-field, slow-motion limit, it is possible to define 10 experimentally measurable parameters which completely characterize predictions of any such theory. This system of these parameters, which can be roughly thought of as describing a kind of ten dimensional "superspace" made from a certain class of classical gravitation theories, is known as [[PPN formalism]] (Parametric Post-Newtonian formalism). [http://relativity.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrr-2001-4&page=node8.html] Current bounds on the PPN parameters [http://wugrav.wustl.edu/people/CMW/expgravpage/ppnbounds.html] are compatible with GR.

==History==
[[Image:1919 eclipse negative.jpg|250px|thumb|right|One of Eddington's photographs of the 1919 eclipse, presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success.]]
{{main|History of general relativity|Classical theories of gravitation}}

General relativity was developed by Einstein in a process that began in 1907 with the publication of an article on the influence of gravity and acceleration on the behavior of light in [[special relativity]]. Soon after, he began to think about how to incorporate [[gravity]] into his new relativistic framework. His considerations led him from a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall to a fully geometric theory of gravity.<ref>This development is traced e.g. in Renn 2005, p. 110ff.,
in chapters 9 through 15 of Pais 1982, and in Janssen 2005.</ref> Most of this work was done in the years 1911&ndash;1915, beginning with the publication of a second article on the effect of gravitation on light. By 1912, Einstein was actively seeking a theory in which gravitation was explained as a geometric phenomenon. In December of 1915, these efforts culminated in Einstein's submission of a paper presenting the [[Einstein field equations]], which are a set of differential equations.<ref name = Ein1916/> Since 1915, the development of general relativity has focused on solving the field equations for various cases. The interpretation of the solutions and their possible experimental and observational testing also constitutes a large part of research in GR.

Starting in 1922, researchers found that cosmological solutions of the Einstein field equations call for an expanding universe. Einstein did not believe in an expanding universe, and so he added a [[cosmological constant]] to the field equations to permit the creation of static universe solutions. In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] found evidence that the universe is expanding. This resulted in Einstein dropping the cosmological constant, referring to it as "the biggest blunder in my career." Progress in solving the field equations and understanding the solutions has been ongoing. Notable solutions have included the [[Schwarzschild solution]] (1916), the [[Reissner-Nordström]] solution, the [[Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric|Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solution]] and the [[Kerr solution]].

Observationally, general relativity has accounted for the discrepancy between the Newtonian prediction and observed perihelion precession of Mercury. In 1919, Eddington's announcement that his observations of stars near the eclipsed Sun confirmed Einstein's prediction for the deflection of light by the Sun helped to cement the status of general relativity as a likely true theory. Since then, many observations have confirmed the predictions of general relativity. These include observations of [[gravitational red shift]], studies of [[binary pulsar]]s, observations of [[radio]] signals passing the limb of the [[Sun]], and the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] system.

The [[Golden age of general relativity]] was a period between approximately 1960 and 1975 when study of general relativity, which had previously been regarded as something of a curiosity, entered the mainstream of [[theoretical physics]] with concepts such as the [[big bang]], [[black holes]], [[quasars]], and [[pulsars]]. While there were many [[contributors to general relativity]], the "golden age" is generally regarded as having ended in 1980 when [[Stephen Hawking]] proposed that [[Hawking radiation|black holes could radiate energy]].

==Status==
The status of general relativity is decidedly mixed{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.

On the one hand, general relativity is a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology. It has passed every unambiguous test to which it has been subjected so far, both observationally and experimentally. It is therefore almost universally accepted by the [[scientific community]].

On the other hand, general relativity is inconsistent with [[quantum mechanics]], and the [[gravitational singularity|singularities]] of [[black hole]]s also raise some disconcerting issues{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. So while it is accepted, there is also a sense{{Fact|date=June 2007}} that something beyond general relativity may yet be found.

Currently, better tests of general relativity are needed. Even the most recent [[binary pulsar]] discoveries only test general relativity to the first order of deviation from Newtonian projections in the [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism|post-Newtonian parameterizations]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. Some way of testing second and higher order terms is needed, and may shed light on how reality differs from general relativity (if it does).

Any [[Lorentzian manifold]] is a solution of the [[Einstein field equation]] for ''some'' conceivable [[stress-energy tensor]]. Thus one must add auxiliary assumptions about the kinds of energy, momentum, and stress in the universe to make any inferences from GTR, e.g. about cosmology.
