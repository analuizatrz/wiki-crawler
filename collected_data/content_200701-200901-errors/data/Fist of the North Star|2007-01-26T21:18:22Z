{{Nihongo|'''''Fist of the North Star'''''|北斗の拳|Hokuto no Ken|literally ''Fist of the [[Big Dipper]]''}} is a [[manga]] series that was originally serialized from [[1983]] to [[1988]] in the [[Japan]]ese ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'', created by [[Tetsuo Hara]] and [[Buronson]]. It was originally collected in 27 individual volumes ([[tankōbon]]) and later rerelased in 15 deluxe ''kazenban''.

Set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post apocalyptic]] world where the Earth is barren and the strong survive by preying on the weak, the series follows the journey of [[Kenshiro]], the successor of [[Hokuto Shinken]] (北斗神拳, "Divine Fist of the Big Dipper"), a secret martial arts style that allows its practioner to destroy an opponent's body from within by striking into vital [[pressure point]]s, often resulting in a violent and gruesome death (as the series was notorious for). Kenshiro uses his skills to protect the weak and innocent against the numerous villains that threaten their survival.

''Fist of the North Star'' is often considered by many to be a precursor to various violent [[martial arts]]-themed manga series. Like many popular titles, it has inspired various animated adaptations, as well merchandises such as action figures and video games.

{{spoiler}}

==Publication history==
===Pilot version===
The original pilot version of ''Hokuto no Ken'', published in the April [[1983]] edition of ''Fresh Jump'', was set in a contemporary setting and told the story of a teenager by the name of {{nihongo|Kasumi Kenshirō|霞 拳四郎}}, the successor of the "Hokuto Shinken", a deadly [[martial arts]] style which kills or cripples opponents internally by striking [[pressure point]]s. Kenshiro's main adversaries in this incanation of the story were a rival martial arts school known as the {{nihongo|Taizanji Kenpo|泰山寺拳法|Mt. Tai Temple Martial Arts}}, which secretly controlled the Japanese government and were responsible for the death of Kenshiro's girlfriend, Yuki. 

''Hokuto no Ken'' was the most popular title in that issue according to the reader [[survey]] and Tetsuo Hara was commissioned to do a sequel. The second pilot, simply titled ''Hokuto no Ken II'',  was published in the June 1983 edition of ''Fresh Jump''. Both pilots were reprinted in the second [[tankobon]] of Tetsuo Hara's short lived [[motorcross]] manga series, ''Tetsuo no Don Quixote''

===Serialization===
[[Image:Shonen Jump 092683.jpg|thumb|left|''Weekly Shonen Jump'', Issue #41 from 1983.]]
When ''Hokuto no Ken'' was picked up to become a weekly series, manga writer {{nihongo|Yoshiyuki Okamura|岡村善行|Okamura Yoshiyuki}} (under the pen name of {{nihongo|[[Buronson]]|武論尊}}) was assigned by the editors of ''Shonen Jump'' to work with Hara as a writer for the series. The storyline was completely revamped, with contemporary setting being discarded in favor of a ''[[Mad Max]]''-like post apocalypse world. Taizanji Kenpo are no longer the main antagonists and Kenshiro, originally a young teenager, was now an adult with seven scars on his chest.

The first story arc of the series focused on Kenshiro's search for his missing [[fiancee]], Yuria, who has been kidnapped by his former friend, Shin, a master of Nanto Seiken (南斗聖拳, ''Holy Fist of the South Dipper'') and the man responsible for the seven scars of Kenshiro's chest. In the introductory chapter, he meets Bat, a young thief who becomes his travelling companion, and Lin, an orphaned girl who regains her ability to speak thanks to Kenshiro's healing skills. As Kenshiro continues his journey, he learns that Shin has formed a ruthless organization under the name of King. Kenshiro infiltrates Shin's city of Southern Cross as he defeats each of Shin's men before confronting Shin. He defeats Shin at the end, only to learn that Yuria is gone, apparently having committed suicide during her captivity.

Kenshiro continues to wander the wasteland with Bat and eventually is reunited with Lin, the girl he saves at the beginning. He continues his fight against injustice, as less prominent villains such as the Golan Army, Jackal and his gang, and the Fang Tribe are introduced. Eventually, we are introduced to the existence of Kenshiro's other brothers, Jagi, Toki and Raoh, all aspiring Hokuto Shinken successors, and the Nanto Rokuseiken (南斗六聖拳, Six Holy Fists of the South Dipper), the six strongest Nanto Seiken, whom the already deceased Shin was part of. Raoh, the oldest of Kenshiro's brothers, has become a conqueror under the name of Ken'O (拳王, lit. "King of Fists") and serves as the main antagonist for most of the series, eventually challenging Kenshiro to a one-on-one duel.

The second half of the story begins several years after the defeat of Raoh with Bat and Lin, now young adults, forming the Hokuto Army in Kenshiro's absence against the oppressive regime Gento Kou Ken (元斗皇拳, Imperial Fist of the Original Dipper). Kenshiro comes back to aid his former sidekicks in their battle against the Gento fighters. Lin learns of her true heritage as the twin sister of the Gento Empress, only to be taken captive to the land of Shura. Kenshiro travels to Shura, learns of the origins of Hokuto Shinken, as well as the existence of another Hokuto fighting style known as Hokuto Ryuken (北斗琉拳, "Lapis Lazuli Fist of the Big Dipper"). Kenshiro eventually faces off against Hokuto Ryuken masters Hyou (Kenshiro's own natural brother) and Kaioh (Raoh's long-lost brother) to save Lin.

In the manga's final chapters, Kenshiro meets Raoh's young son, Ryu, and trains him to become the next Hokuto Shinken successor. The final story arc of the series was essentially a love triangle between Kenshiro, Lin and Bat. Kenshiro loses his memory during a thunderstorm, as well as his knowledge of Hokuto Shinken (however Ken still retain his natural fighting instinct), a blind villain named Bolge comes looking for Kenshiro and Bat takes his place. Kenshiro regains his memory and goes off to rescue Bat from Bolge.

===Later works===
After the manga ended its run, Tetsuo Hara and Buronson wrote a novel based on the manga titled {{nihongo|''Cursed City''|呪縛の街|Jubaku no Machi}}, published by Jump Books in Japan in [[1996]]. It was adapted into a three-part [[OVA]] series titled {{nihongo|''New Fist of the North Star''|新・北斗の拳|Shin Hokuto no Ken}} in [[2003]]. The story is set a few years after the conclusion of the manga, but only features Kenshiro as a returning character (however Ryu and Toki make a short cameo appearance ).

In [[2001]], Tetsuo Hara and Buronson began working on a ''Fist of the North Star'' prequel titled {{nihongo|''[[Fist of the Blue Sky]]''|蒼天の拳|Souten no Ken}}, which is currently being serialized in  ''Weekly Comics Bunch''. Set during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in [[1935]], the story stars Hokuto Shinken predecessor and Kenshiro's namesake, Kenshiro Kasumi.

[[2006]] saw the publication of a trio of manga side-stories based on ''Fist of the North Star'', which were released in conjunction with the theatrical release of the movie {{nihongo|''Legend of Raoh: Chapter of Martyred Love''|ラオウ伝 殉愛の書|Rao Den Jun'ai no Sho}}. Each focused on a major character from the series.  These are as followed.

* {{nihongo|''Raoh's Side-Story: The Tyrant of the Heavens''|ラオウ外伝 天の覇王 |Raō Gaiden - Ten no Haō}} by [[Youkow Osada]]. An ongoing series currently serialized in ''Weekly Comics Bunch'' featuring characters from the ''Raoh Den'' film. Three tankobon have been collected as of December 2006.

* {{nihongo|''Yuria's Side Story: The Merciful Mother Star''|ユリア外伝 慈母の星|Yuria Gaiden - Jibo no Sei}} by [[Ayumi Kasai|Suishō Kasai]]. A three-part series serialized at ''Big Comics Superior'' from [[March 10]] to [[April 14]], [[2006]]. ''Big Comics Superior'' has announced plans to publish new chapters starting next Spring.

* {{nihongo|''Rei's Side-Story: The Magnificent Avenger''|レイ外伝 華麗なる復讐者|Rei Gaiden - Kareinaru Fukushūsha}}, a one-shot story by [[Mie Nekoi|Yasuyuki Nekoi]], published in the [[March 22]], [[2006]] issue of ''Comics Bunch Special''. A sequel is currently scheduled to be published in the [[December 8th]] issue.

* {{nihongo|''Ryūken's Side-Story: Judgement Day''|リュウケン外伝－JUDGEMENT DAY－|Ryūken Gaiden JUDGEMENT DAY}}, a one shot story by [[Shin-ichi Hiromoto|Hiromoto Sin-Ichi]], current scheduled to be published in the [[December 8th]] issue of Comic Bunch.

==English versions==
[[Image:FotNS Master Ed 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Fist of the North Star: Master Edition Vol. 1'', published by Gutsoon.]]
Two separate attempts were made to translate the original ''Fist of the North Star'' manga into the English market, although neither were completed. The first attempt by [[VIZ Media]] (back then known as VIZ Communications) began in [[1989]] using the Western-style left-to-right flopped format and released under the VIZ Select Comics line. The first sixteen chapters were published as an eight-issue [[limited series]] that promoted the North American release of the second ''[[Fist of the North Star (NES)|Hokuto no Ken]]'' video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. VIZ resumed publication of the series from [[1995]] to [[1997]], publishing three subsequent limited series (covering the Jackal, Fang Clan and Jagi arcs). All 28 issues were reprinted in four trade paperbacks (''Fist of the North Star'', ''Night of the Jackal'', ''Southern Cross'' and ''Blood Brothers'').

In [[2003]], Gutsoon Entertainment begin publishing the title as a series of graphic novels under the ''Master Edition'' title. These Master Editions retain the original right-to-left ordering and the Japanese sound effects, but features new [[CGI]] coloring that were not in the original serialized chapters. The Master Editions also featured a more literal translation than the VIZ version. Nine volumes (each corresponding to the original tankobon from Jump Comics) were published from [[2003]] to [[2004]] until Gutsoon folded. The tenth volume was announced, but never released.

==Adaptations==
===First series===
Like many popular manga titles in Japan, ''Fist of the North Star'' was adaptated in an ongoing animated series by [[Toei Animation]]. The original ''Hokuto no Ken'' series aired on [[Fuji Television]] from [[October 4]], [[1984]] to [[March 5]], [[1987]] and was given the foretitle of ''Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu'' (世紀末救世主伝説, ''Legend of the Century's End Savior''). 109 episodes were produced. It was later rerun in Japan on the [[satellite television]] network [[Animax]].

The violence was toned down considerably from the original manga, with many of the bloodshed being whited out, and scenes where children die would be rewritten so that Kenshiro would save the child at the last minute. Like all manga-based anime series, [[Filler (media)|filler]] material were added to prevent the series from getting ahead of the manga. 

The series is divided into four major story arcs or chapters as they were called within the series. In some story arcs, the orders of events were changed for dramatic purposes. This is especially notable in the first story arc, in which the fight with Shin does not occur until after Kenshiro battles the GOLAN army and Jackal's gang (which were surbodinate organizations of Shin in the series).

* Chapter 1: The Bloody Cross (第一部 血の十字架編, ''Chi no Jūjika Hen'') - Episodes 1-22
* Chapter 2: The Dragon & The Tiger, The Winds & The Clouds (第二部 風雲龍虎編, ''Fūun Ryūko Hen'') - Episodes 23-57
* Chapter 3: The Order in a Chaotic Era (第三部 乱世覇道編, ''Ransei Hadō Hen'') - Episodes 58-82
* Final Chapter (最終章, ''Saishūshō'')  - Episodes 83-109

The first 36 episodes were translated into English and released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] by [[Manga Entertainment]], and featured a new opening and ending theme, as well as new background music. The subtitled versions retained the background music, but still had the changed opening and ending themes.

===Second series===
An anime series based the second part of the manga was produced, titled ''Hokuto no Ken 2''.  It aired on the same channel and time slot as the first series, airing from [[March 13]], [[1987]] to [[February 18]], [[1988]].  Only 43 episodes were produced. The series can be divided into two sub-arcs, with the first thirteen episodes covering the "Holy Capital" arc, while the remaining 30 episodes covers the "Shura" arc.

Like in the first, producers took certain creatives with the original manga material, the most notable differences being the removal of Jakou's sons from the story, replaced by two new Gento Ko Ken fighters named Taiga and Boltz. The series ends with the death of Kaio. The subsequent chapters of the manga were not adapted in this series.

===The Animated Movie===
[[Image:FotNS02.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ken, Rei, and Raoh of the ''Fist of the North Star'' movie.]]
The ''Fist of the North Star'' animated film premiered in Japan on [[March 8]], [[1986]], between the airings of episode #66 and #67 of the original series (during its third season), although the manga was already far ahead. The movie was intended to be a big-screen treatment of the manga, and avoid the watering-down of violence that came with the TV series. The English-dubbed version was released in North America by [[Streamline Pictures]] in [[1991]]

In a notable deviation from the series, the film finds time to begin with a detailed peek at the Earth as it was before and during the fabled nuclear devastation. Starting with a calm, surreal look at various points of mother nature, a brief on-screen message then informs the audience of the imminent calamity, followed by unsettling scenes of human life consumed in flame.

The film draws heavily from the first two seasons of the original series, although certain liberties were taken to tell the story in a condensed form. Toki, the second of Kenshiro's older brothers, is never seen or mentioned. Out of the six Nanto Rokuseiken warriors, only  Yuria, Shin and Rei are shown. Yuria's Nanto heritage is mentioned thorough the original Japan version (this was months before the Last Nanto Warrior arc was adapted in the series). Mamiya, Rei 's love interest in the manga, is never seen, partly because Yuria never commits suicide and thus, is the heroine in her place. 

Raoh serves as the main antagonist, with Jagi and Shin as the other two major villains. Many other villains from the manga such as the Colonel and Jackal only make cameo appearances as minor henchmen with some of the notable fight scenes involving Zeed, Heart and Uighur. Only Kiba Daio appears as a rival warlord against Raoh.

There were two endings produced for the film. The original theatrical ending showed Raoh emerging victorious over Kenshiro, but sparing his life, leaving him to protect Lin (hinting her Gento origins). The other ending, which was used on home video versions, ends the fight in a draw. The former ending was used in the English dubbed version by Streamline.

===The live-action movie===
[[Image:Fistmoviejap.jpg|thumb|90px|right|The Live-Action Movie (Toei)]]
Arguably the black sheep of the franchise, this 1995 film created by American director [[Tony Randel]] and starring [[Gary Daniels]] has a mixed reception among fandom. Some are acceptant of it, while detracting voices cite poor production values, too many deviations in this original script co-written by [[Peter Atkins]] & Wynne McLaughlin, and an inherent inability to capture the narrative quality of the anime and manga versions. The Japanese version, renamed ''Hokuto no Ken: Fist of the North Star'' (北斗の拳～フィスト・オブ・ザ・ノーススター～), was released in [[VHS]] the same year by Toei Video. Two editions were available, a subtitled one (字幕) and another one (吹替) dubbed by the '80s TV series' original cast. A ''Behind the Scenes of Hokuto no Ken: Fist of the North Star'' (ビハインド・シーン・オブ北斗の拳～フィスト・オブ・ザ・ノーススター～ ) documentary VHS was released two weeks before the movie itself by Toei Japan. The Japanese DVD edition released in 2004 contains both English and Japanese audio tracks but not the documentary.

===''New Fist of the North Star'' OVAs (新・北斗の拳, ''Shin Hokuto no Ken'')===
From 2003 to 2004, an Original Video Animation series featuring Kenshirō and known as ''New Fist of the North Star'' was released. The OVA contained only three episodes based on the novel ''Jubaku no Machi'' by Buronson and Hara. The new series has received much positive feedback, though some diehard fans of ''Hokuto No Ken'' have been a little disappointed. The scenario has not been well elaborated and the new series relies much more on the animation. 

In the post-apocalyptic world, water has become toxic except for a few safe and preserved reservoirs. A man named Sanga has constructed a fortified zone called The Last Land. While Sanga's men go out and seek water through violent means, they encounter Kenshiro who desires to end their reign of terror. 

Another point of contention was with the recasting of Kenshiro.  [[Akira Kamiya]], who had voiced Kenshiro in all previous anime incarnations, was replaced by [[Takehito Koyasu]] for this new OVA series. Similar to the current trend of American animation, celebrity voices were also employed, including musician [[Gackt]] and wrestler [[Magnum Tokyo]]. 

It was fully licensed by [[ADV Films]], despite the fact that the original series only had 36 episodes released in the US, thus being an incomplete license. This has led to some speculation that [[Saint Seiya]] may get similar treatment in the near future, known as the "Fist of the North Star" theory. (For additional information involving the licensing issues at hand see [[Toei Animation]])

===''Shin Kyūseishu Densetsu'' (真救世主伝説, ''True Saviour Legend'')===
Beginning in 2006, new movies and OVAs are scheduled to be released as a [[pentalogy]] titled ''True Saviour Legend''. Preview trailers can be seen on the [http://www.hokuto-no-ken.jp/ Official Japanese Hokuto no ken Site]. 
The first part of it, "The Legend of Raoh: Martyred Love Arc" (ラオウ伝　殉愛の章, ''Raoh Den Jun-ai no Shō''), debuted [[March 11]]th and also has a new version of ''[[Ai o Torimodose]]'' by Crystal King. It is unknown if they will ever be released in the United States, and there have been no reports of it as of 2007.

'''Remaining Scheduled Works''':
*'''The Legend of Yuria''' (ユリア伝, ''Yuria Den'') scheduled for release on [[February 23]], [[2007]] as an OVA
*'''The Legend of Raoh II:  Fierce Fighting Arc''' (ラオウ伝Ⅱ 激闘の章, ''Raō Den II Gekitō no Shō'') scheduled for release on [[Golden Week (Japan)|Golden Week]], [[2007]] as a theatrical film
*'''The Legend of Toki''' (トキ伝, ''Toki Den'') in 2007 as an OVA
*'''The Legend of Kenshirō''' (ケンシロウ伝, ''Kenshirō Den'') in 2008 as a movie

PachiSlot Hokuto no Ken|Jissen PachiSlot Hisshou Hou!]]"). Sammy had also released ''Hokuto no Ken'' licensed pachinko machines and their video game counterpart ("Jissen Pachinko Hisshou Hou!"). [[Keshi]] series (including [[keshi#Keshi types|SDkeshi]]) were released in Japan by [[Bandai]] during the 1980s.

==Video Games==
{{see|List of Fist of the North Star video games}}
Several [[video game]]s were produced based on the license. Toei Doga published a series of seven [[console game]]s for the [[Famicom]] and then the [[Super Famicom]], evolving from a pair of side-scrolling [[action game]]s (''Hokuto no Ken'' and ''Hokuto no Ken 2'', the latter which was published in North America as ''Fist of the North Star''), to a trilogy of [[Console RPG|RPGs]] (''Hokuto no Ken 3-5'') and then a pair of [[versus fighting game|competitive fighting games]] (''Hokuto no Ken 6-7''). Another fighting game was also produced for the [[Game Boy]] (also released in North America as ''Fist of the North Star''), one of the system's earlier attempts at the genre. At the same time, Sega also published a pair of ''Hokuto no Ken'' action games for the [[Sega Master System|Mark III]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive]], which were both released internationally without the ''Hokuto no Ken'' license as ''[[Black Belt (video game)|Black Belt]]'' and ''[[Last Battle]]'' respectively. A ''Hokuto no Ken'' [[adventure game]] was released in [[1995]] for the [[Sony PlayStation]]. A 3D action game was also released exclusively for the Sony PlayStation in [[2000]] titled ''Hokuto no Ken: Seikimatsu Kyuseishu Densetsu'', which adapts the storyline of the first anime series. [[Sammy Corporation]] also produced video game adaptations popular [[PachiSlot]] games for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. 

[[Arcade games]] based on the series includes the two ''[[Fighting Mania]]'' games released by [[Konami]] and an [[Fist of the North Star (versus fighting game)|arcade fighting game]] designed by [[Arc System Works]] (of ''[[Guilty Gear]]'' fame).
