A '''winter service vehicle''' ('''WSV'''), often known as a '''snow removal unit''' or '''snow removal vehicle''' due to its primary function, is a [[vehicle]] used to perform [[snow removal]], the clearing of [[road]]s or other thoroughfares of [[ice]] or [[snow]], which is difficult to cross and reduces the [[traction (engineering)|traction]] of [[motor vehicle]]s. Winter service vehicles are usually based on [[dump truck]]s, with adaptations allowing them to carry specially designed snow removal equipment, although many authorities also keep a number of smaller vehicles for use on [[Sidewalk|pavements]], [[footpath]]s and [[cycleway]]s. Many road maintenance agencies and contractors own multiple WSVs in order to keep the road network clear and safe for driving.<ref name="highways">[http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/2244.aspx Winter Driving], ''[[Highways Agency]]'', URL accessed [[2007-02-08]].</ref>

Winter service vehicles are also employed by [[airport]]s, in order to keep [[runway]]s and taxiways free of snow and ice, which if left untreated could cause accidents.<ref name="dresden">[http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/struktur/presse/pressemitteilungen/pmDetail.html?id=567 Once around the world: Dresden Airport's Winter Service covered about 40,000 km], ''[[Dresden Airport]]'', [[19 April]] [[2006]], URL accessed [[2007-02-09]].</ref> In most countries, winter service vehicles usually have [[amber (color)|amber]] [[light bar]]s, which are activated to indicate that the vehicle is working or moving at below the local [[speed limit]].<ref name="highways"/> However, in some parts of Canada, blue flashing lights are used instead.<ref name="HTAO">[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Statutes/English/90h08_e.htm#62.(31) Ontario Highway Traffic Act R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER H.8 section 62-31], [[Politics of Ontario|Government of Ontario]] e-Laws website, URL accessed [[2007-02-13]].</ref>

==Types of WSVs==
===Gritter===
[[Image:Schneepflug Strasse hinten.jpg|thumb|right|The hopper and [[impeller]] of a gritter]]
A gritter, also known as a [[Sodium chloride#Road salt|salt]] spreader or salt truck,<ref name="highways">[http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/2244.aspx Winter Driving], ''[[Highways Agency]]'', URL accessed [[2007-02-08]].</ref> is the most common type of winter service vehicle. Gritters are used to spread grit, a mixture of [[sand]] and [[halite|rock salt]], onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, and spread across the roadway by an [[impeller]]. Salt reduces the melting point of ice by a process called [[freezing-point depression]], causing it to melt at lower temperatures and run off harmlessly to the edge of the road, while sand increases traction by increasing [[friction]] between car [[tire]]s and roadways. The amount of salt dropped varies with the condition of the road; to prevent the formation of light ice, approximately 10 [[gram|g]]/[[square metre|m<sup>2</sup>]] is dropped, while thick snow might require 40 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Winter service vehicles can also be used in hot weather, when temperatures are high enough to melt the [[bitumen]] used in [[asphalt]]. Grit is dropped to provide a fine [[insulation|insulating]] layer between the road surface and the tires of passing vehicles, which can damage the road surface.<ref name="summer">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4674893.stm Gritters to combat melting roads], ''[[BBC News]]'', [[July 12]] [[2005]], URL accessed [[2007-02-08]]</ref> The grit is sometimes mixed with [[molasses]] to help adhesion to the road surface. However, the sweet molasses often attracts livestock, who lick the road and can become [[addiction|addicted]] to the sugar.<ref name="sheep">[http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2181287.html New road grit popular - with sheep], ''[[Ananova]]'', URL accessed [[2007-02-09]].</ref> The grit is sometimes heated as it is passed out of the nozzle; this helps melt the ice and improves the [[solubility]] of the salt.

The salt dropped by gritters comes from a [[renewable|non-renewable]] source, and high concentrations of salt in soil kill plants. As a result, road maintenance agencies have advanced networks of ice prediction stations, to prevent unnecessary gritting which can damage the environment and disrupt traffic.<ref name="GNN">[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=138214 New facilities help guard against winter], ''[[Government News Network]]'', [[3 December]] [[2004]], URL accessed [[2007-02-08]]</ref><ref>[http://www.warrington.gov.uk/traffic/gritting.asp Winter Highway Gritting], [[Warrington Borough Council]], URL accessed [[2007-02-08]].</ref> Gritting vehicles are also dangerous to [[overtaking|overtake]]; as grit is scattered across the entire roadway, damage can be incurred by passing cars, and the loose salt does not provide sufficient traction for [[motorbike]]s.<ref name="highways"/> Quieter rural roads may be considered too minor to grit, so [[grit bin]]s are often provided for drivers and pedestrians to shovel onto the road themselves. In some areas of the world, including [[Berlin]], dropping salt is prohibited altogether, except in on the highest risk roads. Instead plain sand, without any melting agents, is spread. Although this protects the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; and as the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for [[bus]]es to pull in at [[bus stop]]s.<ref name="HM">{{cite book|title=Highway Meteorology|others=co-edited by Perry, Allen Howard and Symons, Leslie|publisher=Spon Press|isbn=0419156704|origyear=1991}}</ref> Other areas, including [[Oregon]], use chemicals similar in structure such as [[magnesium chloride]], which are less harmful to the environment and cause less corrosion damage to [[metal]]lic structures.<ref name="Oregon">[http://www.tripcheck.com/Pages/RCMap.asp?mainNav=RoadConditions&staticNav=WinRoadMain Winter Road Maintenance Practices], ''[[Oregon Department of Transportation]]'', URL accessed [[2007-02-13]].</ref>

Gritters are among the winter service vehicles also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the [[airframe]] of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spray less dangerous [[potassium acetate]] solution onto the runways instead.<ref name="Dresden2">[http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/struktur/presse/pressemitteilungen/pmDetail.html?id=385 Winter service team at Dresden Airport ready for the cold season], ''[[Dresden Airport]]'', [[29 October]] [[2004]], URL accessed [[2007-02-09]]</ref>

===Snowplough===
{{main|snowplow}}
{{Seealso|Snowcat}}
[[Image:Schneepflug Strasse vorne.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] snowplow with a hopper for carrying grit]]
Many winter service vehicles can be fitted with [[snowplough]]s, in order to clear roads which are blocked by deep snow. Many winter service vehicles include plough; 75% of the UK's [[Highways Agency]] vehicles can be fitted with a ploughing blade.<ref name="magazine">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6342887.stm How do snowplough drivers get to work?], ''[[BBC News Magazine Monitor]]'', [[8 February]] [[2007]], URL accessed [[2007-02-08]]</ref> In most cases, the ploughare mounted on [[hydraulics|hydraulically]]-actuated arms, allowing them to be raised, lowered, and angled to better move snow. In some areas of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], snowploughing is performed by [[grader]]s. [[Front-end loader]]s can also be used to remove snow: they can use a snowplough attachment which mounts on the loader's arm in place of its bucket, or they can use their bucket or an attachment called a snowbasket to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck which then hauls it away. Snowploughs are however dangerous to [[overtaking|overtake]]; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which is a hazard to vision.<ref name="highways"/>

Most snowploughs run on [[wheel]]s, often with [[snow chain]]s, but some are mounted on [[caterpillar track]]s, with the tracks adapted to throw the snow toward the side of the road.<ref>{{US patent reference|number=4174578|y=1979|m=11|d=20|inventor=Bernardino Grillo|title=Tracked Snowplow}}</ref> [[Off-road]] snowploughs mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as [[snowcat]]s. Snowcats are used by [[ski resort]]s to for [[piste]] and [[snowmobile]] maintenance, and are also often used as a replacement for [[chairlift]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaplan|first=Mitch|title=Snowcat Skiing in Michigan?|publisher=Suite 101|date=[[2006-11-01]]|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Snowcats have also been used by the [[Royal Marines]] for [[NATO]] in [[Norway]] during the [[Cold War]].<ref>[http://www.4x4uk.org/faq/index.php?sid=125100&lang=en&action=artikel&cat=11&id=29&artlang=en Aktiv Snow-Trac Info], ''4x4 UK'', URL accessed [[2007-02-10]].</ref>

===Snow blower===
{{main|snow blower}}
[[Image:Zaugg snowblower 20050315.jpg|thumb|right|A Zaugg snow blower fitted with [[snow chains]]]]

Sometimes known as rotating snowplows or snow cutters,<ref>[http://www.schmidt-automotive.com/holding/english/products/winter/snow/clearing.php Attachable snow clearing], ''Schmidt Automotive'', URL accessed [[2007-02-10]].</ref> snow blowers are used in place of snowploughs. Snow blowers typically clear much faster than ploughs, with some clearing in excess of 5000 [[tonne]]s of snow per hour,<ref name="Blower">[http://www.schmidt-automotive.com/holding/english/products/winter/snow/clearing/automotive/cutter-blower/supra-5001.php  Supra 5001 specification], ''Schmidt Automotive'', URL accessed [[2007-02-10]].</ref> and can remove snow from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the road. <ref>[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-snowblower.htm What is a snowblower?], ''Wisegeek.com'', URL accessed [[2007-02-09]].</ref>

===Surface friction tester===
Generally used at airports or major roadways before ice formation, the surface friction tester usually takes the form of a small car with a fifth wheel attached to the rear axle of the vehicle and canted slightly.<ref>[http://www.asft.se/aviation/MKrear.html MK IV rear axle system], ''Airport Surface Friction Testers'', URL accessed [[2007-02-09]].</ref> Sensors calculate the friction between the wheel and the driving surface, and if friction falls below a safe threshold, alert the control centre to send out other winter surface vehicles to move the snow or ice from the [[runway]], [[taxiway]]s or [[airport ramp|apron]].<ref>[http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/reisende_und_besucher/willkommen/wie_funktioniert/winterdienst/enteiser.html Aircraft De-icing], ''[[Dresden Airport]]'', URL accessed [[2007-02-09]].</ref>

===Snow melting vehicle===
{{seealso|Metromelt}}
[[Image:Snow melter.jpg|thumb|right|Snow melters working at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]]]]
A snow melting vehicle works by scooping snow into a melting pit located in a large tank at the rear of the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a smaller tank full of [[boiling]] water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the [[storm drain]]s.<ref>[http://www.snowmelter.com/principle.html Principle of Operation], ''Trecan Combustion'', URL accessed [[2007-02-09]].</ref>

As they have to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner. snow melting machines tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around {{m to ft|18|wiki=yes}}, with the largest being hauled by [[semi-trailer truck|semi-trailer]] [[tractor unit]]s.<ref>[http://www.snowmelter.com/500pd.html 500-PD specifications], ''Trecan Combustion'', URL accessed [[2007-02-09]].</ref> In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plough or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 tonnes of snow per hour, compared to the 5000 tonnes per hour capacity of the largest snow blower.<ref name="Blower"/> However, snow melters are far more environmentally friendly than gritters, as they do not spray hazardous materials, and pollutants from the road surface can be separated from the meltwater and disposed of safely. In addition, as the snow is melted on board, the costs of removing the collected snow from the site is removed.<ref>[http://www.snowmelter.com/economics.html Economics of Snow Melting], ''Trecan Combustion'', URL accessed [[2007-02-09]].</ref>

===De-icer===
{{seealso|De-icing}}
[[Image:Aircraft Deicing Syracuse.jpg|thumb|right|A de-icing vehicle treating an [[American Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80/MD-90|MD-80]] at [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]]]]
Common at airports, de-icers spray heated [[de-icing fluid]], often [[propylene glycol]] or [[ethylene glycol]], onto icy surfaces such as the bodies of aircraft.<ref name="Dresden2"/> These prevent ice from forming on the body of the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide. Ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect the balance.

De-icing vehicles usually consist of a large [[tanker truck]], containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a [[cherry picker]] crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire [[Boeing 737]] can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.<ref name="Dresden2"/>

Some road contractors also chose to use de-icers as an alternative to gritters; the vehicle carries a tank of [[brine]], which is sprayed on the road surface. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gritty Gritty Bang Bang!|last=Kengt|first=Ann-Marie|publisher=Local Authority Plants and Vehicles Magazine|date=October 2005}}</ref> At some airports, runways are de-iced by sprayers mounted with long spraying arms. These arms can cross the entire runways, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to take place in a single pass.<ref>[http://www.schmidt-automotive.com/holding/english/products/airport/airside/ice/sprayers/sprayers-nozzle.php Airside nozzle sprayers], ''Schmidt Automotive'', URL accessed [[2007-02-10]].</ref>
