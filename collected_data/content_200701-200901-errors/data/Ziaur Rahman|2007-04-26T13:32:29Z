'''Ziaur Rahman''' ({{lang-bn|জিয়াউর রহমান}} ''Ziaur Rôhman'') ([[January 19]] [[1936]] &ndash; [[May 30]] [[1981]]) was the [[President of Bangladesh]] and the founder of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]]. Popularly called '''Zia''', he is also sometimes referred to as a '''Shaheed''' (''Martyr''). His widow [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]] has served as [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]] three times.

An officer in the [[Pakistan Army]], Zia's unit captured the [[Kalurghat]] radio station at the onset of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and declared the independence of Bangladesh on behalf of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]. Recognised as a war hero, he was honoured with the [[Bir Uttom]] in 1972. A high-ranking officer in the [[Bangladesh Army]], Zia was appointed [[Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army|chief of army staff]] following the [[assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] in 1975. Although briefly overthrown in a [[coup d'etat|counter-coup]], Zia returned to power in a military coup organised by Colonel [[Abu Taher]].

Declaring himself president in 1977, Zia won a referendum held in 1978. Founding the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Zia won widespread popular support for stabilising the nation and leading it in a new direction. A [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] politician, Zia established [[free market|free-market policies]] in a 19-point programme of industrialisation and development. He adopted policies bringing the government increasingly under [[Islam]], which he included in the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|national constitution]]. Zia controversially pardoned the assassins of Sheikh Mujib by signing the ''[[Indemnity Act]]'' and rehabilitated individuals who had supported the Pakistan Army. A popular yet controversial leader, Zia was [[Assassination of Ziaur Rahman|assassinated]] in 1981 in an abortive military coup.

==Early life==
'''Ziaur Rahman''' was born in the village of Bagbari in the [[Bogra District]] of the province of [[Bengal]] (now in northwest Bangladesh), although by some other accounts he was born in the city of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].<ref name="EWB">{{cite web

Following the failure of last-ditch talks, Yahya Khan declared [[martial law]] and ordered the army to crack down on Bengali political activities. Before his arrest, Sheikh Mujib declared the independence of Bangladesh on [[March 26]] [[1971]] and exhorted the people of East Pakistan to resist the army.

Zia was appointed commander of [[Mukti Bahini]] (''Liberation Army'') forces in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], working under General [[M. A. G. Osmani]], the supreme commander.<ref name="BPEDIA" /> He worked to provide support and resources to the Mukti Bahini guerilla force and coordinate attacks against the East Pakistani army. At a later phase of the war, Zia travelled across the border into India to receive military resources and training for his troops. Zia also helped coordinate the work of Bangladesh's government-in-exile of [[Mujibnagar]]. On [[June 1]] [[1971]] Zia became the commander of the first conventional [[brigade]] of the Mukti Bahini, which was named "Z Force," after the first initial of his name. This brigade consisted of 1st, 3rd and 8th East Bengali regiments, enabling Zia to launch major attacks on Pakistani forces. During the war his family was placed under house arrest. The guerrilla war continued until the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|direct intervention]] of the [[Indian Army]], which captured [[Dhaka]] and forced the surrender of Pakistani forces on [[December 16]] [[1971]].

Upon his release, Sheikh Mujib assumed charge of the new state's government, and the Indian Army transferred control to the newly-formed [[Bangladesh Army]] on [[March 17]] [[1972]]. Having earned a reputation for courageous leadership during the war, Zia was awarded the [[Bir Uttom]], the second-highest military honour. He was given command of a brigade stationed in [[Comilla]], and in June he was appointed deputy chief of army staff.<ref name="BPEDIA" /> He was later promoted to the rank of [[Major General]] by the end of 1973. As a high-ranking commander, Zia oversaw the training and development of the army.

==Coup of 1975 and its aftermath==
By 1975, Sheikh Mujib's assumption of dictatorial powers had disillusioned and angered many Bangladeshis, including army officers. On [[August 15]] [[1975]] Sheikh Mujib and his family were murdered by a group of military officers. [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]], one of the key plotters of the coup, took over as president, and appointed Major General Ziaur Rahman as chief of army staff.<ref name="BPEDIA" /> It is not known if Zia had himself helped plot the coup against Sheikh Mujib, but he had now become one of the most powerful men in the nation.<ref name="JSTOR3">{{cite web

A third coup was staged under Colonel [[Abu Taher]] and a group of socialist military officers and supporters of the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal]] on [[November 7]], called the ''[[National Revolution and Solidarity Day|Sipoy-Janata Biplob]]'' (''Soldiers and People's Coup'').<ref name="JSTOR3">{{cite web

Zia began reorienting Bangladesh's foreign policy, addressing the concerns of nationalists who believed that Bangladesh was reliant on Indian economic and military aid. Zia withdrew from his predecessors' affinity with the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]], developing closer relations with the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]]. Zia also moved to harmonise ties with [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]], who had opposed Bangladesh's creation and had not recognised it till 1975. Zia also dropped the demands of reparations and an official apology demanded by Sheikh Mujib and moved to normalise relations with Pakistan. While distancing Bangladesh from India, Zia sought to improve ties with other Islamic nations. Zia's move towards Islamic state policies improved the nation's standing in the [[Middle East]].<ref name="Rule">{{cite web

In Article 8(1) and 8(1A) the statement ''"absolute trust and faith in Almighty Allah"'' was added, replacing the commitment to [[secularism]]. [[Socialism]] was redefined as ''"economic and social justice."''

In public speeches and policies that he formulated, Zia began expounding "Bangladeshi nationalism," as opposed to Mujib's assertion of a Bengali national identity. Zia emphasised the national role of Islam (as practised by the majority of Bangladeshis). Claiming to promote an inclusive national identity, Zia reached out to non-Bengali minorities such as the [[Santal]]s, [[Garo (tribe)|Garos]], [[Manipur]]is and [[Chakma]]s, as well as the [[Urdu]]-speaking peoples of [[Bihar|Bihari]] origin. However, many of these groups were predominantly [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhist]] and were alienated by Zia's promotion of political Islam. In an effort to promote cultural assimilation and economic development, Zia appointed a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] Development Commission in 1976, but resisted holding a political dialogue with the representatives of the hill tribes on the issue of autonomy and cultural self-preservation.<ref name="CHTD">{{cite web

===Indemnity===
As Bangladesh's ruler, Zia enacted several controversial measures, ostensibly to win the support of Islamic political parties and opponents of the Awami League. He revoked the ban on the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh|Jamaat-e-Islami]], which was widely believed to have collaborated with the Pakistani army and in committing [[war crime]]s against civilians. [[Golam Azam]], the exiled chief of the Jammat-e-Islami, was allowed to come back in July [[1978]] with a Pakistani passport on a visitor's visa, and he remained in Bangladesh following its expiry. He was not brought to trial over his alleged role in committing wartime atrocities, and Jamaat leaders were appointed in ministerial posts.<ref name="SAAGI">{{cite web

Amidst speculation and fears of unrest, Zia went on tour to Chittagong on [[May 29]] [[1981]] to help resolve an intra-party political dispute in the regional BNP. Zia and his entourage stayed overnight at the Chittagong Circuit House, a rest house. In the early hours of the morning of [[May 30]], he was assassinated by a group of army officers along with six bodyguards and two aides.<ref name="killing">{{cite web

In the trials that followed, a sizable number of officers and enlisted men received death penalty for complicity. Zia was buried at the [[Chandrima Uddan]] in the locality of [[Sher-e-Banglanagar]] in Dhaka.<ref name="BPEDIA" /> Large processions of supporters and BNP activists attended the funeral. Vice President Abdus Sattar immediately succeeded him, and led the BNP to victory in elections held in 1981. However, army chief Gen. Ershad overthrew this government in a coup on [[March 24]] [[1982]].
