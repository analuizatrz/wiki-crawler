'''Timothy "Tim" William Burton''' (born [[August 25]], [[1958]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-nominated and [[Golden Globe]]-winning [[United States|American]]  [[film director]], [[screenwriter]] and [[set designer]], notable for the quirky and often dark, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] atmosphere pervading his high-profile films. The protagonists are usually misfits or outsiders, physically or emotionally different or scarred.

The director of two [[Batman]] films, ''[[Batman (1989 movie)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), he has collaborated with actor [[Johnny Depp]] and actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]] prolifically in films such as ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ]]'' and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' in 2005. His 2007 film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', also starring [[Johnny Depp|Depp]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter|Bonham Carter]] in the leading roles, won the award for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical)]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor (Comedy or Musical)]] at the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]]. It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[80th Academy Awards]]. He has also collaborated extensively with composer [[Danny Elfman]], in all but two of his films.

==Early life==
Burton was born in [[Burbank, Los Angeles County, California|Burbank, California]], the first of two sons to Bill Burton and Jean Erickson. His year of birth is sometimes mistakenly given as 1960, most notably in his own books,  and the picture book of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. Burton described his childhood self as quirky, self-absorbed and highly imaginative. As a teen growing up in [[Burbank, Los Angeles County, California|Burbank]], he staged an axe murder with his brother to scare the neighbors, prompting one to call the police, and this is how he got a nickname, Axe Wound. As he grew older, he found home life and school somewhat difficult, often escaping the reality by watching horror and low budget films, to which he would later pay tribute in [[Ed Wood (film)|his biography]] of [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood]]. Tim grew up on Evergreen Street, very near the Valhalla Cemetery in Burbank. Tim has spoken in interviews about the "weirdness" of growing up near a cemetery. He attended Providencia Elementary School in Burbank, Luther Burbank Jr. High, and later Burbank High School, which his father Bill had also attended. His father Bill worked for many years in the Recreation Department for the City of Burbank. Another film figure of importance in Burton's childhood is [[Vincent Price]], whose films would deeply influence the upcoming director's career. He was inspired early on by [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion films.
After high school, he won a Disney scholarship to attend the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in [[Valencia, California]]. He studied at the ''Character Animation program'' for three years. Burton's first job in animation was working as a cell painter on [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09|publisher=IGN Filmforce}}</ref><ref name="EI8">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1517&sid=601500f503e3dc48d13ca4a47d25be52 |title=Bakshi Board Exclusive Interview #8 |accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> Burton was then hired by the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Walt Disney Studios]] as an animator apprentice. Burton's job was to draw for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]'', but he was dissatisfied with the artistic direction of the movie. He later commented on the refusal of Disney to use his design for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]'' because his designs made the characters, in opposition to Disney's desires, "look like roadkill." Burton was not happy during his Disney period, but it was then that he wrote and drew the poem and illustrations that would be the basis for his celebrated ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''.

==Early career (1980s)==
In 1982, Burton made his first short, ''[[Vincent (film)|Vincent]]'', a six-minute black and white [[stop-motion]] film based around a poem written by Burton, and depicting a young boy who fantasizes that he is his (and Burton's) screen idol [[Vincent Price]], with Price himself providing narration. The film was produced by Burton's girlfriend at the time, who was an executive at Disney.  The two also co-authored a screenplay titled "True Love."  Once the film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released, alongside the teen drama [[Tex (film)|Tex]], for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema, Burton abruptly ended his relationship with his producer-partner-girlfriend. This was followed by Burton's first live-action production ''Hansel and Gretel'', a Japanese themed adaptation of Grimm's tale for [[The Disney Channel]], which climaxes in a kung-fu fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch. Having aired once at 10:30pm on Halloween 1982 and promptly shelved, it is next to impossible to locate, which contributes to the false rumor that this project does not exist. Next was the live-action short ''[[Frankenweenie]]'', starring [[Barret Oliver]], [[Daniel Stern]] and [[Shelley Duvall]] (an early supporter of Burton's work). Shot in black and white and inspired by [[James Whale]]'s film of Mary Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''Frankenweenie'' features a boy who reanimates his dog Sparky who was hit by a car. Although the film won praise at film festivals, Disney was concerned that the film was too scary for children and, not knowing what to do with it, shelved the film. (''Frankenweenie'' later received a video release in 1992).

Although Burton's work had yet to see wide release, he began to attract the attention of the film industry. Actor/producer [[Griffin Dunne]] approached Burton to direct ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), a comedy about a bored word processor who survives a crazy night in [[SoHo]] that had already been passed over by [[Martin Scorsese]]. However, when financing for ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' fell through, Burton bowed out of the project out of respect for Scorsese.

===''Pee-Wee's Big Adventure''===
{{main|Pee-Wee's Big Adventure}}
Not long after, actor [[Paul Reubens]] saw ''Frankenweenie'' and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spinoff of his popular character [[Pee-wee Herman]]. Pee-Wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at the Roxy which was later turned into an [[The Pee-wee Herman Show|HBO special]]. The film, ''[[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), was made on a budget of $7 million and grossed more than $40 million at the box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group [[Oingo Boingo]], asked vocalist/songwriter [[Danny Elfman]] to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has provided the score for all but two Burton films, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', and ''[[Sweeney Todd (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''.

===''Beetlejuice''===
{{main|Beetlejuice}}
After directing episodes for the revitalized TV series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', Burton received his next big project: ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), a supernatural comedy about a young couple forced to cope with life after death, as well as a family of pretentious yuppies invading their treasured New England home. Starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Geena Davis]], and featuring [[Michael Keaton]] as the famously repulsive bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, the film grossed about $80 million on a relatively low budget and won a Best Makeup Design Oscar.  It would later be converted into a [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|cartoon of the same name]], with Burton playing a role as executive producer, that would run for four seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later [[Fox Broadcasting|Fox]].

===''Batman''===
{{main|Batman (1989 film)}}
Burton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives and he received his first big budget film ''Batman'' (1989). The mega-budget production, based in London, was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], but the most notable debacle involved casting. Burton wanted to cast [[Michael Keaton]] from his previous role as [[Beetlejuice]], despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won out in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped. Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a bulked-up he-man as Batman, insisting that the Caped Crusader should be an ordinary (albeit fabulously wealthy) man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton cast [[Jack Nicholson]] as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] ([[Tim Curry]] being his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a superhero film.

When the film opened in June 1989, it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing well over [[United States dollar|$]]400 million worldwide and $250 million in the U.S. alone (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and winning critical acclaim for both Keaton and Nicholson as well as the film's technical aspects. The film proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' for a grimmer, more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth.

Burton claimed that ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' was a major influence on his [[Batman (1989 film)|film adaptation of ''Batman'']]:
<blockquote>"I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and The Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan—and I think it started when I was a child—is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was [[dyslexia]] or whatever, but that's why I loved ''The Killing Joke'', because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable."<ref>Tim Burton, ''Burton on Burton: Revised Edition'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 71.</ref></blockquote>

==1990s==
===''Edward Scissorhands''===
{{main|Edward Scissorhands}}
In 1990, Burton co-wrote (with [[Caroline Thompson]]) and directed ''Edward Scissorhands'', re-uniting with [[Winona Ryder]] from ''Beetlejuice''. His friend, [[Johnny Depp]], a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by [[Vincent Price]], in his last appearance on screen before his death). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (the film was shot in Lakeland, Florida), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his own childhood in the suburb of Burbank. Price at one point is said to have remarked, "Tim is Edward." Johnny Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, ''Burton on Burton'', regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. ''Edward'' is considered Burton's best movie by many fans and critics. Following this collaboration with Burton, Depp went on to star in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''.
In 2004 [[Matthew Bourne]] came to Burton with the idea to turn the story of Edward into a ballet in 2005 the ballet first aired leading a world with the growing phenomenon Edward has now toured every major city in the world.

===''Batman Returns''===
{{main|Batman Returns}}
Although Warner Brothers had declined to make the more personal ''Scissorhands'' even after the success of ''Batman'', Burton finally agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Brothers on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was ''Batman Returns'' which featured [[Michael Keaton]] returning as the Dark Knight, and a new triad of villains: [[Danny DeVito]] (as the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]), [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] (as [[Catwoman]]) and [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Max Shreck]], an evil corporate tycoon. Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children. Audiences were even more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume. One critic remarked, "too many villains spoiled the Batman", highlighting Burton's decision to focus the storyline more on the villains instead of Batman. The film also polarized the fanbase, with some loving the darkness and quirkiness, while others felt it was not true to the core aspects of the source material.  Tim Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would be applied to the Penguin in both comics and television. While in the comics, he was an ordinary man, Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose, and a penguin-like body. ''[[Batman Returns]]'' was made for $80 million, equivalent to over $119.8 million in 2007, and grossed $282.8 million world-wide, equivalent to over $423.6 million in 2007.

Burton then went on to do preliminary work on the [[Batman Forever|third installment in the franchise]]. [[Val Kilmer]] was cast as the title character (after Michael Keaton turned down the offer to reprise his previous role after Burton's departure from the project), [[Chris O'Donnell]] was cast as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Jim Carrey]] was cast as [[the Riddler]] (after [[Robin Williams]] turned down the part), [[Tommy Lee Jones]] was cast as [[Two-Face]], and [[Nicole Kidman]] was cast as love interest Dr. Chase Meridian. Warner Brothers ultimately threw out Burton after they realized the tone of the film was to be similar to ''Batman Returns''. Burton left the Batman franchise (he was credited as a producer in name only for the [[Joel Schumacher]]–directed ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), a movie which he said had a title "like a tattoo you get when you're on drugs").

===''The Nightmare Before Christmas''=== 
{{main|The Nightmare Before Christmas}}
Next, Burton wrote and produced (but did not direct, due to schedule constraints on ''Batman Returns'') ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' (1993), originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme. The film was directed by [[Henry Selick]] and written by [[Michael McDowell (author)|Michael McDowell]] and Caroline Thompson, based on Burton's original story, world and characters.  The film received positive reviews for the film's stop motion animation, musical score and original storyline and was a box office success grossing $50 million. Burton collaborated with Selick again for ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), which Burton co-produced. The movie helped to generate a renewed interest in stop-motion animation. Today it is considered something of a cult classic.

A deleted scene from ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' features a group of vampires playing hockey on the frozen pond with the decapitated head of producer Tim Burton. The head was later replaced with a [[Jack-o'-lantern]].

===''Ed Wood''===
{{main|Ed Wood (film)}}
His next film, ''Ed Wood'' (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood Jr]], a filmmaker sometimes called "the worst director of all time." Starring [[Johnny Depp]] in the title role, the film is a homage to the low-budget sci-fi and horror films of Burton's childhood, and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity. Due to creative squabbles during the making of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', [[Danny Elfman]] declined to score ''Ed Wood'', and the assignment went to [[Howard Shore]]. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Ed Wood'' was well received by critics and has since gathered a considerable fanbase, as well as helped revive the public interest for the films of Ed Wood Jr. [[Martin Landau]] also received an Academy Award, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his portrayal of [[Bela Lugosi]].

===''Mars Attacks!''===
{{main|Mars Attacks!}}
Elfman and Burton reunited for ''Mars Attacks!'' (1996). Based on a popular science fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950s sci-fi flicks and 1970s all-star disaster flicks—an anarchic cacophony of clever satire and goofy mayhem. Coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster, ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'', made around the same time and released five months earlier. Although the film boasted an all-star cast, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Lukas Haas]], [[Glenn Close]],  and [[Rod Steiger]] among others, the film received mixed reviews by American critics and was mostly ignored by American audiences. It was however more successful abroad, and later managed to gather an American fan base from its television airings and DVD release.

===''Sleepy Hollow''===
{{main|Sleepy Hollow (film)}}
''Sleepy Hollow'', released in the autumn of 1999, was a return to vintage Burton, with a supernatural setting, unique sets and another offbeat performance by [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Ichabod Crane]], now a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of [[Washington Irving]]'s original tale. With ''Hollow,'' Burton paid homage to the old horror movies from English company [[Hammer Film Productions]].  Hammer veteran [[Christopher Lee]] is given a cameo role. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles ([[Michael Gough]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], and [[Christopher Walken]], among others) and [[Christina Ricci]] was cast as Katrina van Tassel. Mostly well-received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's Gothic score, the film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as well as two BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, ''Sleepy Hollow'' was also a turning point for Burton. Along with change in his personal life (separation from Lisa Marie), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was "not a remake" of the earlier film.

===''Tim Burton's Lost In Oz''===
{{main|Tim Burton's Lost In Oz}}
Conceived as an original television series based on the immortal works of L. Frank Baum, "Tim Burton's Lost In Oz" was never aired.  Though a pilot script was written by Trey Callaway with direct input from Burton as an executive producer and a number of key scenes were filmed by veteran television producer/director Michael Katleman, budgetary constraints ultimately prevented the project from being fully realized.

===''The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories''===
{{main|The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories}}
His book ''The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories'' was published in 1996. The collection of verse is about misfit children such as ''Oyster Boy'', ''Match Girl'', ''[[Stainboy]]'' (which later became short animations), the Girl Who Turned into a Bed, and other such outcasts. The book was published by the publishing company [[Faber and Faber]], which also published the original artwork of ''Sleepy Hollow'' in 1999.

==The 2000s==
===''Planet of the Apes''===
{{main|Planet of the Apes (2001 film)}}
''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' was a commercial success, grossing $68 million in its opening weekend. It was however panned by critics and widely considered inferior to the first adaptation of [[Planet of the Apes|the book]]. The main criticism was that the movie went for a more watered down "popcorn" feel than the dark, cerebral and nihilistic tone of the 1968 film. The film was a significant departure from Burton's usual style, and there was much subsequent debate about whether the film was really Burton's, or if he was just a "hired gun" who did what he was asked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/tim-burton|title=http://www.answers.com/topic/tim-burton}}</ref> Burton reportedly clashed with the studio during the whole making of the film, once going as far as abruptly leaving the set for the day. There were also many reports about last minute changes in the movie. Despite the commercial success of the movie and an ending that clearly suggested the possibility of a sequel, apparently there are no intentions from the studio or Burton to make another ''Apes'' movie. During the making of the film, Burton also met leading actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who played monkey princess Ari, who he later went on to date and father children with. She was cast in all of Burton's subsequent films.

===''Big Fish''===
In 2003, Burton went on to direct ''[[Big Fish]]'', based loosely on the novel ''[[Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]'' by [[Daniel Wallace]]. The film is about a father telling the story of his life to his son using exaggeration and color. Starring [[Ewan McGregor]] as young Edward Bloom and [[Albert Finney]] as an older Edward Bloom. The film also stars [[Jessica Lange]], [[Danny Devito]], and [[Alison Lohman]]. ''Big Fish'' received four [[Golden Globe]] nominations as well as an [[Academy Award]] nomination for the musical score by [[Danny Elfman]]. ''Big Fish'' was also the second collaboration with Burton and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who played  Jenny and the Witch with the magic eye that shows Edward Bloom his death. Although it was not a box office success, the film was critically acclaimed and widely considered to be a return to form for Burton.

===''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''===
''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005) is an adaptation of the book by [[Roald Dahl]]. Starring [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]] and [[Freddie Highmore]] as [[Charlie Bucket]], the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation, [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]], although some liberties were taken, such as adding Wonka's issue with his father. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was later nominated for the [[Academy Award for Costume Design]]. ''Charlie'' was a huge box office success that made over $207 million domestically. It became one of Burton's most critically-praised movies in years.

===''Corpse Bride''===
''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005) was Burton's second stop-motion film, featuring the voices of [[Johnny Depp]] as Victor and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] (for whom the project was specifically created) as Emily in the lead roles. It was released two weeks prior to that of ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', which also had the voice of Helena Bonham Carter. In this movie, Burton was able to again use his familiar styles and trademarks, such as the complex interaction between light and darkness, and of being caught between two irreconcilable worlds. The film is often compared to Burton's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and ''Bride'' is often considered the [[spiritual successor]] of ''Nightmare''. ''Bride'' received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature Film]]. Along with ''Charlie'', ''Bride'' was one of Burton's most critically-praised movies in years.

===''Believe It or Not''===
In 2006 Burton began early work on the film ''Believe It or Not''. By June, Burton announced that he would be postponing his work on this film to instead concentrate on the [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|film adaptation]] of Stephen Sondheim's ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''. This would become yet another collaboration with [[Johnny Depp]], who signed on to play the murderous barber, and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who portrayed the eccentric [[Mrs. Lovett]]. By [[June 19]], [[2007]] Burton announced that he was withdrawing completely from the ''Believe It or Not'' film.

===''Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street''===
{{main|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)}}
The Dreamworks/Warner Bros. production was released on [[December 21]], [[2007]]. Burton's work on ''Sweeney Todd'' won the National Board of Review Award for Best Director<ref>[http://imdb.com/name/nm0000318/awards Tim Burton (I) - Awards]</ref>, received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director.<ref>[http://imdb.com/features/rto/2008/globes 65th Annual Golden Globe Awards</ref> and won an Oscar for Best Achievement in Art Direction. [[Helena Bonham Carter]] won an Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of [[Mrs. Lovett]], as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.
Actor [[Johnny Depp]] was also nominated for the best actor Oscar, for the role of [[Sweeney Todd]]. Depp also won the award for Best Villain as Todd in the 2008 MTV awards.

==Personal life==
Burton was married to a German-born artist for four years, whom he left for [[Lisa Marie]], a model with whom he lived and was "engaged" from 1992 through 2001.  Lisa Marie had  parts in all of his films while they were a couple, most notably Ed Wood and Mars Attacks! Burton currently lives with [[Helena Bonham Carter]], whom he met while filming Planet of the Apes, in which Lisa Marie had a bit part but [[Helena Bonham Carter|Bonham Carter]] had a starring role; he abruptly left Lisa Marie for [[Helena Bonham Carter|Bonham Carter]] and they now have a son, Billy Ray Burton, born [[October 4]], [[2003]], and a daughter, Nell Burton, born [[December 15]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrity-babies.com/2007/12/tim-burton-and.html|title=Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter (he is also shagging johhny depp) take son Billy Ray for a walk|accessdate=2007-12-27|date=2007-12-27|publisher=Celebrity-babies.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrity-babies.com/2008/01/helena-bonham-3.html|title=Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton out for a walk in Primose Hill with children|accessdate=2007-01-31|date=2007-01-28|publisher=Celebrity-babies.com}}</ref> Burton and [[Helena Bonham Carter|Bonham Carter]] live in [[Belsize Park]], [[London]]. The couple also own the home of former British Prime Minister [[Herbert Henry Asquith]], [[Helena Bonham Carter|Bonham Carter]]'s great-grandfather, in Belsize Park, London, it's an adjoining houses with a connecting hallway, each part decorated and styled to suit their own personalities, because they felt they couldn't live 'together' but didn't want to live apart. They also own a house in Sutton Courtenay, near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. The pair used to own two apartments in the [[Greenwich Village]] of [[USA]] but recently sold them for ''£4.38 million.''

Burton made close friends with [[Johnny Depp]], one of his son's godfathers soon after his birth. In ''Burton On Burton'', Depp wrote the intro, stating, "What more can I say about him? He is a brother, a friend, my godson's father. He is a unique and brave soul, someone that I would go to the ends of the earth for, and I know, full and well, he would do the same for me."

==Recurring cast members==
Burton often casts certain actors more than once in his films. [[Johnny Depp]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Michael Gough]], [[Jeffrey Jones]] and [[Michael Keaton]] are amongst his most frequent of collaborators.
