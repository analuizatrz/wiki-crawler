It was released in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2007. The film is an adaptation of the [[Hairspray (musical)|2002 Broadway musical of the same name]], and a remake of [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 comedy film of the same name]].  Set in 1962 [[Baltimore, Maryland]], the film follows a "pleasantly plump" teenager named Tracy Turnblad as she simultaneously pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV show and rallies against [[racial segregation]].

Adapted from both Waters's 1988 script and [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] and Mark O'Donnell's book for the stage musical by screenwriter [[Leslie Dixon]], the 2007 film version of ''Hairspray'' is directed and choreographed by [[Adam Shankman]]. ''Hairspray'' stars [[John Travolta]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Amanda Bynes]], [[James Marsden]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Brittany Snow]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Elijah Kelley]], [[Allison Janney]] and introduces [[Nikki Blonsky]] as Tracy Turnblad. ''Hairspray'' features songs from the Broadway musical written by [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]], as well as four new Shaiman/Wittman compositions not present in the original Broadway version.

Opening to positive reviews, ''Hairspray'' met with financial success, breaking the record for biggest sales at opening weekend for a movie musical,<ref name="MojoGray"/> which the film held until July 2008 when it was surpassed by ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]''<ref name="MusicalMovies"/>  and later ''[[High School Musical 3]]''.

==Plot==
On May 3, 1962, Tracy Turnblad ([[Nikki Blonsky]]), a cheerful, rotund high school student living in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], endures a day's worth of school so that she and her best friend Penny Pingleton ([[Amanda Bynes]]) can race home to view their favorite [[television show|TV program]], ''The Corny Collins Show''. The program, a teen dance show, is broadcast from Baltimore's station WYZT on weekday afternoons.

The teenagers featured on the show attend Tracy and Penny's school, in particular the arrogant rich girl Amber Von Tussle ([[Brittany Snow]]) and her boyfriend Link Larkin ([[Zac Efron]]), with whom Tracy is madly in love. Amber's mother Velma ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) manages station WYZT, and goes out of her way to make sure that Amber is prominently featured and that ''The Corny Collins Show'' remains a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] program. Corny Collins ([[James Marsden]]) and all of his "Council Members" are white; black kids are only allowed on ''The Corny Collins Show'' on "Negro Day", held the last Tuesday of each month and hosted by local [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] radio [[DJ]] "Motormouth‚Äù Maybelle ([[Queen Latifah]]).

Neither Tracy's reclusive laundress mother Edna ([[John Travolta]]) nor Penny's strict [[Catholic]] mother Prudy ([[Allison Janney]]) approve of their daughters basing their lives around a TV show, particularly one where teens dance to "[[race music]]". Tracy's father, Wilbur ([[Christopher Walken]]), a joke-shop proprietor, is far more lenient. On one day's show, Corny Collins announces that one of his "Council Members" is going on a leave of absence, and that auditions for a replacement will be held the next morning during school hours. When Tracy attends, Velma rejects Tracy at the audition for being overweight and supportive of [[Racial integration|integration]]. Tracy is sent to [[detention]] for skipping school, learning that the African-American students practice their dance in the school's detention hall. Tracy befriends the detention hall's best dancer, Motormouth Maybelle's son, Seaweed ([[Elijah Kelley]]), who teaches Tracy several R&B dance moves. These moves secure Tracy a position in ''The Corny Collins Show''.

Tracy quickly becomes one of Corny's most popular "Council Members" and a threat to Velma's wish to have Amber win the show's yearly "Miss Teenage Hairspray" pageant. Tracy also becomes a threat to Amber's courtship of Link, as the boy becomes increasingly fond of Tracy and less so of Amber. Tracy's popularity earns her a sponsorship offer from clothes salesman Mr. Pinky ([[Jerry Stiller]]), who wants Tracy to be the spokesgirl for his "Hefty Hideaway" [[boutique]]. Tracy convinces Edna to accompany her to the "Hefty Hideaway" and act as her negotiating agent, and in the process brings her mother's days as an [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobe]] to an end.

At school, Tracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, whereupon the two are instantly smitten with each other. One afternoon after Amber deliberately has Tracy sent to detention, Link causes the teacher to send him after her. There, Seaweed invites the girls and Link to follow him and his sister Little Inez ([[Taylor Parks]]) to a [[record hop|platter party]] at Motormouth Maybelle's record shop. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has canceled "Negro Day". Tracy, in reply, suggests that Maybelle and the others stage a [[Demonstration (people)|protest march]], which they plan for the next afternoon, a day before the "Miss Teenage Hairspray" pageant. Link, scheduled to sing at the pageant and fearing for his budding career, does not attend the demonstration, disappointing Tracy. Meanwhile in Tracy's father's joke shop, Velma visits Wilbur and flirts with him, and Edna arrives home and finds Velma, sitting on Wilbur and then pushing him up against the wall. Distraught, Edna kicks Wilbur out and bans Tracy from ever performing on that show, which was Velma's intention. Tracy talks with her father and he and Edna reconcile through song and dance.

[[Image:HairspraySeaweed&Inez.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Seaweed Stubbs ([[Elijah Kelley]], ''left'') introduces his sister Little Inez ([[Taylor Parks]], ''center'') during "Run and Tell That".]]
The next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest march, which comes to a halt at a police roadblock set up by Velma. The entire company of protesters is arrested, although Tracy manages to escape. She flees to the Pingletons' house, where Penny lets her hide in a basement fallout shelter. Prudy discovers Tracy and calls the police while tying Penny to her bed upstairs with a [[jump rope]]. Seaweed and his friends, having been bailed out by Wilbur, arrive and help Tracy and Penny escape. The kids then concoct a plan to crash the "Miss Teenage Hairspray" pageant. Meanwhile, Link visits Tracy's house to look for her, and realizes that he is as much in love with her as she is with him. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape from her house.

With the pageant underway, Velma, leaving nothing to chance, places policemen around and inside station WYZT to prevent Tracy from entering. In addition, Velma switches the tallies from the pageant's phone lines so that Amber is guaranteed to win. Penny arrives at the pageant with an incognito Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and Seaweed's friends help Tracy infiltrate the studio in time to participate in the "Miss Teenage Hairspray" dance contest. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Inez, who has just arrived at WYZT with Maybelle, to the stage to dance in the pageant.

Against all expectations, Inez receives the most votes and wins the pageant, officially [[Racial integration|integrating]] ''The Corny Collins Show''. A perturbed Velma loudly declares her frustration, informing her daughter of the tally-switching scheme. Unbeknownst to Velma, Edna has turned a camera on her, and Velma's outburst is broadcast live on the air, causing her to be fired from the program. Meanwhile, ''The Corny Collins Show'' set explodes into a celebration as Link and Tracy cement their love with a kiss.

==Production==
===Early development===
Following the success of the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', which won eight [[Tony Award]]s in 2003, [[New Line Cinema]], who owned the rights to the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 John Waters film]] upon which the stage musical is based, became interested in adapting the stage show as a musical film. Development work began in late 2004, while a similar film-to-Broadway-to-film project, [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]]'', was in production.<ref name="EarlyDev">{{cite web|last=Mohr|first=Ian|title=Casting looms for New Line's younger-skewing 'Hairspray'.|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]|date=March 2007|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1437/is_200503/ai_n18398452|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref>

[[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron|Neil Meron's]] [[Academy Award]]-winning film adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', were hired as the producers for ''Hairspray'',<ref name="TimeWarner">{{cite news|title=Craig Zadan and Neil Meron Signed to Produce New Line Cinema‚Äôs Musical Film Version of Hairspray|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=2004-11-29|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,832538,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> and began discussing possibly casting [[John Travolta]] and [[Billy Crystal]] (or [[Jim Broadbent]]) as Edna and Wilbur Turnblad, respectively.<ref name="EarlyDev"/> [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] and Mark O'Donnell, authors of the book for the stage musical, wrote the first draft of the film's screenplay, but were replaced by [[Leslie Dixon]], screenwriter for family comedies such as ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' and ''[[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]]''.<ref name="EarlyDev"/> After a year's deliberation on who should direct the film, Zadan and Meron finally decided to hire [[Adam Shankman]] to both direct and choreograph ''Hairspray''.<ref name="Shankman2">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #2|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=19655|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> Upon learning he had been hired, Shankman arranged a meeting with John Waters, who advised him "don't do what I did, don't do what the play did. You've gotta do your own thing."<ref name="Fresh Air">{{cite web|title=NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=[[2007-07-19]]|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&agg=0&prgDate=07-19-2007&view=storyview|accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> Despite this, Shankman still noted "all roads of ''Hairspray'' lead back to John Waters."<ref name="Fresh Air"/>

===(Screen to) stage to screen changes===
Dixon was primarily hired to tone down much of the [[Camp (style)|campiness]] inherent in the stage musical.<ref name="ScriptMag">Verini, Bob ([[July 2007|July]]/August 2007). "Miss Beehive-ing: Leslie Dixon styles ''Hairspray'' for the Big Screen." ''Script''. Pgs. 60-66</ref> The 2007 film's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile, Franklin Von Tussle, Tammy Turner, the [[beatnik]]s, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma in charge of the station where ''The Corny Collins Show'' is filmed.

One notable difference between the stage musical, the original movie, and the 2007 film version of ''Hairspray'' is that Tracy does not go to jail in the 2007 version. In both previous incarnations of ''Hairspray'', Tracy is arrested and taken to jail along with the other protesters. Edna is presented in this version as an insecure introvert, in contrast to the relatively bolder incarnations present in the 1988 film and the stage musical.<ref name="ScriptMag"/> Among many other elements changed or added to this version are the removal of Motormouth Maybelle's habit of constantly speaking in rhyming [[jive talk]], and doubling the number of teens in Corny Collins' Council (from ten on Broadway to twenty in the 2007 film).<ref name="Shankman13">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #13 |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-07-21]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=20111|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref>

Dixon restructured portions of ''Hairspray's'' book to allow several of the songs to blend more naturally into the plot, in particular "(You're) Timeless to Me" and "I Know Where I've Been". "(You're) Timeless to Me" becomes the anchor of a newly invented subplot involving Velma's attempt to break up Tracy's parents' marriage and keep the girl off ''The Corny Collins Show'' as a result. The song now serves as Wilbur's apology to Edna, in addition to its original purpose in the stage musical as a [[tongue-in-cheek]] declaration of Wilbur and Edna's love for each other.<ref name="ScriptMag"/> Meanwhile, "I Know Where I've Been", instead of being sung by Maybelle alone after being let out of jail, now underscores Maybelle's march on WYZT (which takes place in the stage musical only briefly during "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful").<ref name="ScriptMag"/>

The song "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful" was inspired by a line that Tracy delivered in the original film ("Now all of Baltimore will know: I'm big, blonde and beautiful!"), but in the stage version and this film, the song is performed by Motormouth Maybelle. A reprise of the song was added to the 2007 film, which is sung by Edna and Velma.

===Pre-production and casting===
''Hairspray'' was produced on a budget of $75 million.<ref name="budget">{{cite news|last=Marr|first=Merissa|title=At 20, ‚ÄòHairspray‚Äô Gets a Third ‚ÄòDo.|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter|Hollywood Report]]|date=[[2007-05-25]]|url=http://i53.photobucket.com/albums/g52/Hairspray-Movie-Musical/WallStreetJournal-may25.jpg|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

===Shankman's inspirations===
Shankman included "a lot of winks" to films that influenced his work on ''Hairspray'':<ref name="Fresh Air"/>
* The film's opening shot ‚Äî a bird's eye view of Baltimore that eventually descends from the clouds to ground level&nbsp;‚Äî is a combination of the opening shots of ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''.<ref name="Fresh Air"/><ref name="ProducerHomage">{{cite video|people=Zadan, Craig (Producer)|date2=2007-11-20|title=Hairspray: Commentary with Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427327/|medium=DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema|location=New York, NY|accessdate=2008-07-23|time=0:02:00 - 0:02:47|quote=So the opening shot, basically coming down through the clouds and finding Baltimore is our homage to Robert Wise, to the director of ''West Side Story'' and ''The Sound of Music'' because both of those movies begin with shots through the clouds coming down. In ''West Side Story'' it was through the streets of New York to find the Jets on this... schoolyard, and in, of course, the classic ''Sound of Music'' coming down through the clouds and finding Maria spinning on the mountaintop. And the other homage that we have in this song is, uh, our homage to ''Funny Girl''. When Tracy Turnblad eventually gets on top of that garbage truck, that was our homage to Barbra Streisand in a tugboat during "Don't Rain on My Parade" in, in that great sequence in ''Funny Girl''.}}</ref>
*The dress that Penny wears during the "You Can't Stop the Beat" musical number is made from her bedroom curtains, which can be seen during "Without Love". This is an homage to ''The Sound of Music'', where [[Maria von Trapp|Maria]] uses old curtains to make play clothes for the von Trapp children.<ref name="Commentary1">{{cite video|people=Shankman, Adam (Director)|date2=2007-11-20|title=Hairspray: Commentary with Director Adam Shankman and Nikki Blonsky|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427327/|medium=DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema|location=New York, NY|accessdate=2008-07-23|time=1:37:47 - 1:37:59|quote=I think we had to sew Amanda into that dress.... It's her curtains from her bedroom which is an homage to ''Sound of Music''. Another one of my little musical references.}}</ref>
* Several scenes involving Tracy, such as her ride atop the garbage truck during the "Good Morning Baltimore" number and her new hairstyle during "Welcome to the 60's", are directly inspired by the [[Barbra Streisand]] musical film version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' (1968).<ref name="Fresh Air"/><ref name="Shankman15">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #15|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-07-25]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=20195|accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref><ref name="Commentary2">{{cite video|people=Shankman, Adam (Director)|date2=2007-11-20|title=Hairspray: Commentary with Director Adam Shankman and Nikki Blonsky|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427327/|medium=DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema|location=New York, NY|accessdate=2008-07-23|time=0:45:23 - 0:45:42|quote=This was Michelle Pfeiffer's first scene, and [Blonsky's] hairstyle I stole... as a joke off of ''Funny Girl'', which is also what the garbage truck was too, which is like the tugboat in ''Funny Girl'', but Barbra Streisand has, like, a hairdo just exactly like this in, umm, the scene where she goes over to Nicky Arnstein.}}</ref><ref name="ProducerHomage"/>
* During "Without Love", Link sings to a photograph of Tracy, which comes to life and sings harmony with him. This is directly inspired from the [[MGM]] musical ''[[The Broadway Melody of 1938]]'', in which a young [[Judy Garland]] swoons over a photo of actor [[Clark Gable]] as she sings "You Made Me Love You".<ref name="Fresh Air"/>
* During one song, a group of backup singers in ‚ÄúThe New Girl in Town‚Äù can be heard to sing "Look out, look out, look out, look out!" which is a line from ''Little Shop of Horrors,'' another musical set in that era.

===Song score production and changes===
Music producer/composer/co-lyricist [[Marc Shaiman]] and co-lyricist [[Scott Wittman]] were required to alter their Broadway ''Hairspray'' song score in various ways in order to work on film, from changing portions of the lyrics in some songs (e.g., "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs", "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful", and "You Can't Stop the Beat") to more or less completely removing other songs from the film altogether.

"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now", a popular number from the stage musical, features Tracy, Penny, and Amber arguing with their respective mothers. Neither Adam Shankman nor Leslie Dixon could come up with a solution for filming "Mama" that did not require a three-way split screen&nbsp;‚Äî something they wanted to avoid<ref name="ScriptMag"/>&nbsp;‚Äî and both felt the number did not adequately advance the plot.<ref name="ScriptMag"/><ref name="Shankman3">{{cite web |last=Shankman|first=Adam |title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #3 |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |date=[[2007-07-21]] |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=19657 |accessdate=2007-08-20 }}</ref> As a result, "Mama" was reluctantly dropped from the film during pre-production, although it is used by Shaiman as an instrumental number when the ''Corny Collins'' kids dance the "Stricken Chicken". A special version of "Mama" was recorded for the film's end credits in May 2007, during the final score recording process, which featured vocals from each of the three women most famous for portraying Tracy Turnblad: [[Ricki Lake]] from the 1988 film, [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] from the original Broadway cast, and Nikki Blonsky from the 2007 film.<ref name="Orchestra">{{cite news |last=Burlingame|first=Jon |title=You Can't Stop The Beat: Shaiman's unrivaled songwriting talent is outed by ''Hairspray'' colleagues |publisher=[[The Film Music Society]] |date=[[2007-07-11]] |url=http://www.filmmusicsociety.org/news_events/features/2007/071107.html?IsArchive=071107 |accessdate=2007-08-20 }}</ref> [[Harvey Fierstein]], who portrayed Edna as part of the original Broadway cast, has a brief cameo moment in the end credits version of "Mama" as well.<ref name="Orchestra"/>

"It Takes Two", a solo for Link, was moved from its place in the stage musical (on Tracy's first day on ''The Corny Collins Show'') to an earlier ''Corny Collins'' scene, although only the [[coda]] of the song is used in the final release print. "Cooties", a solo for Amber in the stage musical, is present in this film as an instrumental during the Miss Teenage Hairspray dance-off. As with "Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now", a version of "Cooties", performed in a contemporary pop rendition by [[Aimee Allen]], is present during the end credits.

The performance of a vintage dance called [[Madison (dance)|The Madison]], present in both the 1988 film and the stage musical, was replaced for this version by a newly composed song, "Ladies' Choice". Portions of the Madison dance steps were integrated into the choreography for the musical number "You Can't Stop the Beat", and the song the dance is performed to on Broadway can be heard faintly during Motormouth Maybelle's platter party in the film, re-titled "Boink-Boink". "The Big Dollhouse" was the only song from the musical not used in the film in any way.

Shaiman and Wittman composed two new songs for the 2007 film: "Ladies' Choice", a solo for Link, and "Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)", a song performed during the end credits by Queen Latifah, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, and Elijah Kelley. Another "new" song in the 2007 film, "The New Girl in Town", had originally been composed for the Broadway musical, but was deemed unnecessary and discarded from the musical. Director Adam Shankman decided to use the song to both underscore a rise-to-fame montage for Tracy and to showcase Maybelle's "Negro Day", which is never actually seen in either of the earlier incarnations of ''Hairspray''.<ref>Shankman, Adam (2007). ''Hairspray: Soundtrack to the Motion Picture'' [Liner notes]. New York: New Line Records.</ref>

One additional Shaiman/Wittman song, a ballad entitled "I Can Wait", was composed for the film as a solo for Tracy, meant to replace the stage musical's reprise of "Good Morning Baltimore". "I Can Wait" was shot for the film (Tracy performs the number while locked in Prudy's basement), but was eventually deleted from the final release print. The audio recording of "I Can Wait" was made available as a special bonus track for customers who pre-ordered the ''Hairspray'' soundtrack on [[iTunes]], and the scene itself was included as a special feature on the film's DVD release.<ref name="Shankman19">{{cite web |last=Shankman|first=Adam |title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #19 |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |date=[[2007-08-07]] |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=20531 |accessdate=2007-08-20 }}</ref>

Post-production took place in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Composer/co-lyricist Marc Shaiman continued work on the film's music, employing the [[Hollywood Symphony Orchestra]] to record instrumentation for both the songs and the incidental score.<ref name="Orchestra"/>

Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, saying that there was "a lot of craft and slyness lurking beneath the circa-1960s goofiness," also stating that "The point, however, is not the plot but the energy.

''[[The New Yorker]]''‚Äôs [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] felt the new version of ''Hairspray'' was "perfectly pleasant," but compared unfavorably to the Broadway musical, since "[director Adam Shankman and screenwriter Leslie Dixon] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor."<ref name="DavidDenby">{{cite news |last=Denby|first=David |title=Hairspray |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date=[[2007-07-30]] |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/hairspray_shankman |accessdate=2007-08-26 }}</ref>  Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them "unimaginatively shot," and he considered "the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy‚Äôs hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal."<ref name="DavidDenby"/> Stephanie Zacharek of ''[[Salon.com]]'' found ''Hairspray'' "reasonably entertaining. But do we really need to be entertained reasonably? Waters's original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this ''Hairspray'' toils needlessly to make sense of that craziness, and something gets lost in the translation."<ref name="Zacharek">{{cite web |last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie |title="Hairspray" |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |date=[[2007-07-20]] |url= http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2007/07/20/hairspray/index1.html |accessdate=2007-08-26 }}</ref>  Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of "I Know Where I've Been" was incorporated into the movie, saying "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... [but] the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them."<ref name="Zacharek"/>

===''Washington Blade'' boycott controversy===
Although it was generally received well by both critics and the box office, ''Hairspray'' nonetheless garnered some criticism upon its release by individuals in the [[homosexual|gay]] community. Much of this criticism surrounded Travolta's portrayal of Edna Turnblad, a role played in the original film by celebrated drag performer [[Divine (actor)|Divine]], and in the stage adaptation by [[Harvey Fierstein]]. Kevin Naff, a managing editor for [[Washington, DC]]/Baltimore area online gay news site ''[[The Washington Blade]]'' called for a boycott of the new ''Hairspray'' film, alleging that [[Scientology]], in which Travolta believes, was patently [[homophobic]], and allegedly supported [[ex-gay|workshops designed to "cure" homosexuals]].<ref name="Boycott">{{cite news|last=Walls|first=Jeannette |title=Travolta says ''Hairspray'' isn't a gay film |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=[[2007-07-03]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19512551/ |accessdate=2007-08-20 }}</ref> Adam Shankman protested Naff's proposed boycott, stating that Travolta was not homophobic, as he (Shankman), Waters, Shaiman, Wittman, and several other members of the creative staff were gay, and Travolta got along well with the entire crew.<ref name="ShankmanOnBoycott">{{cite web |title=Shankman Blasts Proposed ''Hairspray'' Boycott |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=[[2007-07-16]] |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Shankman_Blasts_Proposed_Hairspray_Boycott/4404792 |accessdate=2007-08-20 }}</ref> "John's personal beliefs did not walk onto my set," said Shankman. "I never heard the word 'Scientology.'"<ref name="ShankmanOnBoycott"/>

===Home video and television===
''Hairspray'' was released in standard DVD and [[high definition video|high-definition]] [[Blu-ray Disc]] formats in [[DVD region code|Region 1]] on November 20, 2007. The [[Blu-ray]] disc is encoded with 7.1 channel [[DTS-HD Master Audio]].<ref name="StageToScreens">{{cite web|last=Buckley|first=Michael|title=Stage To Screens: Menken & Schwartz Are "Enchanted"; Plus Bosco, Chenoweth, "Hairspray"|publisher=[[Playbill]]|date=[[2007-11-18]]|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/112881.html|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> The standard DVD was released in two versions: a one-disc release and a two-disc "Shake and Shimmy" edition.

Bonus features on the two-disc release include two [[audio commentary|audio commentaries]], a feature-length production documentary, featurettes on the earlier versions of ''Hairspray'', dance instruction featurettes, [[deleted scenes]] including Tracy's deleted song "I Can Wait", and behind-the-scenes looks at the production of each of the film's dance numbers. The Blu-ray Disc release, a two-disc release, includes all of the features from the two-disc DVD, and includes a picture-in-picture behind-the-scenes feature, which runs concurrently with the film. An [[HD DVD]] version of the film was originally slated for release in 2008, but has since been cancelled due to [[New Line Cinema]]'s announcement that it would go Blu-ray exclusive with immediate effect, thus dropping HD DVD support.<ref name="HD-DVD1">{{cite web|title=Warner Goes Blu: The Story So Far|publisher=High-Def Digest|date=[[2008-01-06]]|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/featurewarnergoesblu_10608.html|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref><ref name="HD-DVD2">{{cite web|title=New Line Details Transition to Blu-ray|publisher=High-Def Digest|date=[[2008-01-08]]|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/New_Line/Industry_Trends/New_Line_Details_Transition_to_Blu-ray/1351|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref>

[[Sky Movies]] Premiere UK have started showing the film on October 11, 2008.

===Sequel===
Due to ''Hairspray'''s financial success, [[New Line Cinema]] has asked [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] to write a sequel to the film.<ref name="Sequel"/> Waters will reunite with director/choreographer [[Adam Shankman]] for the project, and songwriters [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]] are set to compose the film's musical numbers.<ref name="Sequel"/><ref name="MoreHairspray">{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=New Line asks for more 'Hairspray'|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2008-07-23|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117989390.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> The story will likely pick up where the first film left off, and while no official casting has been announced, New Line has said that they hope to "snag much of the original ''Hairspray'' cast."<ref name="Sequel"/> The sequel is tentatively set for a mid-July 2010 release by [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name="Sequel"/>
