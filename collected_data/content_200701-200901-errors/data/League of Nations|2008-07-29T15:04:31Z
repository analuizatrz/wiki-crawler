The '''League of Nations''' was an [[international organization]] founded as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919–1920. At its greatest extent from [[28 September]] [[1934]] to the [[23 February]] [[1935]], it had 58 members. The League's goals included [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing [[war]] through [[collective security]], settling disputes between [[country|countries]] through [[negotiation]], [[diplomacy]] and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions, keep to economic sanctions which the League ordered, or provide an army, when needed, for the League to use. However, they were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could also hurt the League members imposing the sanctions and given the pacifist attitude following World War I, countries were reluctant to take military action. [[Benito Mussolini]] stated that "The League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|title=The Elusiveness of Trust: the experience of Security Council and Iran |accessdate=2008-06-27 |publisher=Transnational Foundation of Peace and Future Research |last=Jahanpour|first=Farhang |format=PDF}}</ref>
   
After a number of notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the [[Axis Powers]] in the 1930s. The onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]] suggested that the League had failed in its primary purpose, which was to avoid any future world war. The [[United Nations]] replaced it after the end of the war and inherited a number of agencies and organizations founded by the League.

==Origins==
[[Image:Origin of the League of Nations.png|thumb|right|250px|''A commemorative card depicting American President Wilson and the "Origin of the League of Nations"'']]

The concept of a peaceful community of [[nation]]s had been outlined as far back as 1795, when [[Immanuel Kant]]’s ''Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |publisher=Mount Holyoke College| title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref> outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.<ref>Skirbekk and Gilje 2001, p. 288</ref>  International co-operation to promote [[collective security]] originated in the [[Concert of Europe]] that developed after the [[Napoleonic War]] in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between [[Europe]]an states and so avoid war.<ref>Reichard 2006, p. 9</ref><ref>Rapoport 1995, pp. 498-500</ref>  <!--Some expansion here?  Other philosophical forebears?--> This period also saw the development of international law with the first [[Geneva conventions]] establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.<ref>Bouchet-Saulnier, Brav, and Olivier 2007, pp. 14-134</ref><ref>Northedge 1986, p. 10</ref> The forerunner of the League of Nations, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU), was formed by peace activists [[William Randal Cremer]] and [[Frederic Passy]] in 1889.  The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of [[parliament]], in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914.  Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration.    The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.<ref>{{Cite web | title =Before the League of Nations | publisher = The United Nations Office at Geneva | url =http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument | accessdate =2008-06-14}}</ref>

At the start of the twentieth century two power blocks emerged through alliances between the European [[Great Powers]].  It was these alliances that came into effect at the [[Origins of World War I|start of the First World War]] in 1914, drawing all the major European powers into the war.  This was the first major war in Europe between [[industrialized]] countries and the first time in Western Europe the results of [[industrialization]] (for example [[mass production]]) had been dedicated to war.  The result of this [[industrial warfare]] was an unprecedented casualty level with eight and a half million members of [[armed services]] dead, an estimated, 21 million wounded and approximately 10 million [[civilian]] deaths.<ref>Bell 2007, pp. 15-17</ref><ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 1-2</ref> By the time the fighting ended in November 1918, the war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage on the continent.<ref>Bell 2007, p. 16</ref>  Anti-war sentiment rose across the world, the [[First World War]] was described as "the war to end all wars",<ref name=archer14>Archer 2001, p. 14</ref><ref>Northedge 1986, p. 1</ref> and its possible causes were vigorously investigated.  The causes identified included [[arms race]]s, alliances, secret diplomacy and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit.  The perceived remedies to these were seen as the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through [[disarmament]], open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage wars and penalties that made war unattractive to nations.<ref>Bell 2007, p. 8</ref>

While the First World War was still underway, a number of governments and groups had already started developing plans to change the way international relations were carried out in order to prevent a repetition of the war.<ref name=archer14/>  The idea for the League of Nations itself appears<!--weasel word--> to have originated<!--when?--> with the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]].{{Fact|date=June 2008}}  [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] and his advisor [[Colonel]] [[Edward M. House]] enthusiastically adopted the idea as a means of avoiding any repetition of the bloodshed seen in World War I. The creation of the League's was a centerpiece of Wilson's [[Fourteen Points|Fourteen Points for Peace]],<ref>Kawamura 2000, p. 135</ref><!--Is this reference necessary?--> specifically the final point: "A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike."<ref>{{Cite web | author=[[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson, Woodrow]] | date =[[8 January]] [[1918]] | title =President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points | publisher =The Avalon Project | url =http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wilson14.htm | accessdate =2008-04-19}}</ref>

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], that sought a lasting peace after World War I, approved the proposal to create the League of Nations ([[French language|French]]: ''Société des Nations'', [[German language|German]]: ''Völkerbund'') on [[25 January]] [[1919]].<ref>Magliveras 1999, p. 8</ref> The [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On [[28 June]] [[1919]],<ref>Magliveras 1999, pp. 8–12</ref><ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 35–36</ref> the Covenant was signed by 44 states, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] or joined it during the conflict. Despite Wilson's efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1919,<ref>Levinovitz and Ringertz 2001, p. 170</ref> the United States did not join the League. Opposition in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], particularly from [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] politicians [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and [[William Edgar Borah|William E. Borah]], together with Wilson's refusal to compromise, ensured that the United States would not [[ratification|ratify]] the Covenant.

The League held its first council meeting in [[Paris]] on [[16 January]] [[1920]], six days after the Versailles Treaty came into force.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 51</ref> In November, the headquarters of the League moved to [[Geneva]], where the first General Assembly was held on [[15 November]] [[1920]]<ref>Scott 1973, p. 67</ref> with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.

==Languages and symbols==
The official languages of the League of Nations were [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]]<ref>Burkman 1995</ref> and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (from 1920).  The League seriously considered adopting [[Esperanto]] as their working language and actively encouraging its use but neither option was ever adopted.<ref name="Language">Kontra et. al. 1999, p. 32</ref>  In 1921, there was a proposal by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] to introduce Esperanto into state schools of member nations and a report was commissioned to investigate this.<ref>Forster 1982, p. 173</ref>  When the report was presented two years later it recommended  the teaching of Esperanto in schools, a proposal that 11 delegates accepted.<ref name="Language" /> The strongest opposition came from the French delegate, [[Gabriel Hanotaux]], partially in order to protect the French Language which he argued was already the international language.<ref>Forster 1982, pp. 171–76</ref> This opposition meant the report was accepted apart from the section that approved Esperanto in schools.<ref>Forster 1982, p. 175</ref>

The League of Nations had neither an official [[flag]] nor [[logo]]. Proposals for adopting an official symbol were made during the League's beginning in 1920, but the member states never reached agreement. However, League of Nations organizations used varying logos and flags (or none at all) in their own operations. An international contest was held in 1929 to find a design, which again failed to produce a symbol.<ref name="Flag">{{Cite web | date = [[2005-07-09]] | title =League of Nations | publisher = FOTW Flags Of The World website | url =http://www.atlasgeo.net/fotw/flags/league.html | accessdate =2008-05-05}}</ref> One of the reasons for this failure may have been the fear by the member states that the power of the supranational organization might supersede their own.  Finally, in 1939, a semi-official emblem emerged: two five-pointed [[star (symbol)|star]]s within a blue [[pentagon]]. The pentagon and the five-pointed stars were supposed to symbolize the five [[continent]]s and the [[race (historical definitions)|five races]] of mankind. In a bow on top and at the bottom, the flag had the names in [[English language|English]] (''League of Nations'') and [[French language|French]] (''Société des Nations''). This flag was used on the building of the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] in 1939 and 1940.<ref name="Flag"/>

==Principal organs==
[[Image:Palais des nations.jpg|right|thumb|[[Palace of Nations]], Geneva, the League's headquarters]]
{{Further|[[Permanent Court of International Justice]], and [[Leaders of the League of Nations]]}}

The League had four principal organs, a [[Secretary|secretariat]] (headed by the [[Secretary General|General Secretary]] and based in [[Geneva]]), a Council, an Assembly and a [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].<ref>Meyer and Prugl 1999, p. 20</ref>  The League also had numerous agencies and commissions. Authorization for any action required both a unanimous vote by the Council and a majority vote in the Assembly.

===Secretariat and Assembly ===
The staff of the League's secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the [[civil service]] for the League.  The League of Nations' Assembly was a meeting of all the member states, with each state allowed up to three representatives and one vote.<ref name="UNOG">{{Cite web | title =Organization and establishment:The main bodies of the League of Nations | publisher = The United Nations Office at Geneva | url =http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/84C4520213F947DDC1256F32002E23DB?OpenDocument | accessdate =2008-05-18}}</ref>  The Assembly met in Geneva and, after its initial sessions in 1920,<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 72</ref> sessions were held once a year in September.<ref name="UNOG"/>

===Council===
The League Council acted as a type of [[Executive (government)|executive]] body directing the Assembly's business.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 48</ref> The Council began with four permanent members (the [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]]) and four non-permanent members which were elected by the Assembly for a three year period.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 42–48</ref> The first four non-permanent members were [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Greece]] and [[Spain]]. The [[United States]] was meant to be the fifth permanent member, but the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] voted on [[19 March]] [[1920]] against the [[ratification]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], thus preventing American participation in the League. 

The composition of the Council was subsequently changed a number of times. The number of non-permanent members was first increased to six on [[22 September]] [[1922]], and then to nine on [[8 September]] [[1926]]. [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] also joined the League and became a fifth permanent member of the Council on the latter date, giving the Council a total of fifteen members. Later, after Germany and Japan both left the League, the number of non-permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven.

The Council met, on average, five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 public sessions were held between 1920 and 1939.

===Other bodies===
The League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the [[arms control|Disarmament]] Commission, the [[World Health Organization|Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], the [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates]] Commission, the [[International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation]] (precursor to [[UNESCO]]), the Permanent Central [[Opium]] Board, the Commission for [[Refugee]]s, and the [[Slavery]] Commission.  Several of these institutions were transferred to the [[United Nations]] after the [[Second World War]]; the International Labour Organization, the Permanent Court of International Justice (as the [[International Court of Justice]]), and the Health Organization (restructured as the [[World Health Organization]]) all became a UN institutions.

====Health Organization====
The League's health organization had three bodies, a Health Bureau, containing permanent officials of the League, an [[Executive (government)|executive]] section the General Advisory Council or Conference consisting of medical experts, and a Health Committee.  The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League's health work, and get work ready to be presented to the Council.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 182</ref>  This body focused on ending [[leprosy]], [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate [[mosquito]]es. The Health Organization also worked successfully with the government of the [[Soviet Union]] to prevent [[typhus]] epidemics including organising a large education campaign about the disease.<ref>Baumslag 2005, p. 8</ref> 

[[Image:Kamerun children weaving.jpg|thumb|right|Child Labour in [[Kamerun]] during 1919]]

====International Labour Organization====
{{main|International Labour Organization}}
In 1919, the International Labour Organization (ILO) was created as part of the Versailles Treaty and became part of the League's operations.<ref name="Northedge17980">Northedge 1986, pp. 179–80</ref>  Its first director was [[Albert Thomas (minister)|Albert Thomas]].<ref>Scott 1973, p. 53</ref> The ILO successfully restricted the addition of [[lead]] to [[paint#Pigment|paint]],<ref>Frowein and Rüdiger 2000, p. 167</ref> and convinced several countries to adopt an [[eight hour day|eight-hour work day]] and forty-eight hour working week. It also worked to end [[child labour]], increase the [[feminism|rights of women]] in the workplace, and make [[shipping|shipowners]] liable for accidents involving seamen.<ref name="Northedge17980"/>  The organization continued to exist after the end of the League, becoming an agency of the [[United Nations]] in 1946.<ref name="ILO"> {{Cite web | title =Origins and history | publisher =International Labour organization | url =http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Origins_and_history/lang--en/index.htm | accessdate =2008-04-25}}</ref>

====Permanent Central Opium Board====
The League wanted to regulate the [[drug trade]] and established the Permanent Central Opium Board to supervise the statistical control system introduced by the second [[International Opium Convention]] that mediated the production, manufacture, trade and retail of [[opium]] and its by-products. The Board also established a system of import certificates and export authorizations for the legal [[international trade]] in [[narcotic]]s.<ref>McAllister 1999, pp. 76–77</ref>

[[Image:Nansenpassport.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A sample Nansen passport]]

====Slavery Commission====
The Slavery Commission sought to eradicate [[slavery]] and [[slave trade|slave trading]] across the world, and fought forced [[prostitution]].<ref name="Northedge18586">Northedge 1986, pp. 185–86</ref> Its main success was through pressing the governments who administered mandated countries to end slavery in those countries.  The League secured a commitment from [[Ethiopia]] to end slavery as a condition of membership in 1926, and worked with [[Liberia]] to abolish [[forced labour]] and inter-tribal slavery.<ref name="Northedge18586"/>  It succeeded in gaining the emancipation of 200,000 slaves in [[Sierra Leone]] and organized raids against slave traders in its efforts to stop the practice of [[indentured labour|forced labour]] in [[Africa]].{{Fact|date=May 2008}}  It also succeeded in reducing the death rate of workers constructing the [[Usambara Railway|Tanganyika railway]] from 55% to 4%. Records were kept to control slavery, prostitution, and the trafficking of women and children.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 166</ref>  

====Commission for Refugees====
Led by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], the Commission for Refugees looked after the interests of refugees including overseeing their repatriation and, when necessary resettlement.<ref name="Northedge77">Northedge 1986, p. 77</ref>  At the end of the First World War there were two to three million ex-[[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] dispersed throughout Russia,<ref name="Northedge77" /> within two years of the commission's foundation, in 1920, it had helped 425,000 of them return home.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 59</ref> It established camps in [[Turkey]] in 1922 to deal with a refugee crisis in that country and to help prevent disease and hunger. It also established the [[Nansen passport]] as a means of identification for [[Stateless person|stateless]] peoples.<ref>Torpey 2000, p. 129</ref>

====Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women====
The Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women sought to make an inquiry into the status of women all over the world.  It was formed in April 1938, and dissolved in early 1939.  Committee members included Mme. P. Bastid (France), M. de Ruelle (Belgium), Mme. Anka Godjevac (Yugoslavia), Mr. H. C. Gutteridge (Great Britain), Mlle. Kerstin Hesselgren (Sweden),<ref>For a full biography, see [[:sv:Kerstin Hesselgren]] (in Swedish).</ref> Ms. [[Dorothy Kenyon]] (United States), M. Paul Sebastyen (Hungary) and Secretariat Mr. Hugh McKinnon Wood (Great Britain).

==Members==

[[Image:League of Nations Anachronous Map.PNG|thumb|300px|right|An anachronous map of the world in the years 1920–1945, which shows the League of Nations and the world.]]
Of the 42 founder members, 23 (or 24, counting [[Free France]]) remained members until the League of Nations was dissolved in 1946. In the founding year, six other states joined, only two of which remained members throughout its existence. An additional 15 countries joined in later years.

The largest number of member states was 58 between [[28 September]] [[1934]], when [[Ecuador]] joined, and [[23 February]] [[1935]], when [[Paraguay]] withdrew. At this time, only [[Costa Rica]] ([[22 January]] [[1925]]), [[Brazil]] ([[14 June]] [[1926]]), the [[Empire of Japan]] ([[27 March]] [[1933]]) and [[Germany]] ([[19 September]] [[1933]]) had withdrawn and only [[Egypt]] was left to join (on [[26 May]] [[1937]]).

The [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was the only (founding) member to leave the league but return to it later.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

The [[Soviet Union]], only became a member on [[18 September]] [[1934]],<ref name="Scott312">Scott 1973, pp. 312, 398</ref> when it joined to antagonise Germany (which had left the year before),<ref name="Pyhalov" /> and was expelled from the League on [[14 December]] [[1939]],<ref name="Scott312" /> for [[Winter War|aggression against Finland]].<ref name="Pyhalov" /> In expelling the Soviet Union, the League broke its own norms; only 7 of 15 members of the Council voted for the expulsion (Great Britain, France, Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, South African Union and the Dominican Republic), which was not the majority of votes required by the Charter to do so. Three of these members were chosen as members of the Council the day before the voting (South African Union, Bolivia and Egypt).<ref name="Pyhalov">{{ru icon}} [http://militera.lib.ru/research/pyhalov_i/06.html Igor Pychalov.

[[Egypt]] was the last state to join ([[26 May]] [[1937]]). The first member to withdraw or leave from the League after its founding was [[Costa Rica]] on [[22 January]] [[1925]], having joined on [[16 December]] [[1920]], this also makes it the member to have most quickly withdrawn or left after its joining); the last member to leave or withdraw from the League before its dissolution was [[Luxembourg]] on [[30 August]] [[1942]]. [[Brazil]] was the first founding member to leave ([[14 June]] [[1926]]) and [[Haiti]] was the last (April 1942).

[[Iraq]], which joined in 1932, was the first member of the league that had previously been a [[League of Nations Mandate]].<ref>Tripp 2002, p. 75</ref>

==Mandates==
{{main|League of Nations Mandate}}

League of Nations Mandates were established under Article 22 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. These territories were former [[colony|colonies]] of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] that were placed under the supervision of the League following [[World War I]]. The Permanent Mandates Commission supervised League of Nations [[#Mandates|Mandates]], and also organised [[plebiscite]]s in disputed territories so that residents could decide which country they would join.  There were three Mandate classifications. 
The "A" Mandates (mainly applied to parts of the old Ottoman Empire) were  territories that had {{Quotation|...reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.<ref name="Mandate">{{Cite web | last =League of Nations | date=1924 | title =The Covenant of the League of Nations:Article 22 | publisher =The Avalon Project at Yale Law School | url =http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/leagcov.htm | accessdate =2006-04-26}}</ref> |Article 22|The Covenant of the League of Nations}}
The "B" Mandates were applied to the former [[German colonial empire|German Colonies]] that the League took responsibility for after the First World War.  This was a territory that the League said was {{Quotation|...at such a stage that the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory, and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League.<ref name="Mandate" />|Article 22|The Covenant of the League of Nations}}
Areas in [[South-West Africa]] and certain of the [[Oceania|South Pacific Islands]] were administrated by League members under a C Mandate.  These were classified as territory {{Quotation|...which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population."<ref name="Mandate" />|Article 22|The Covenant of the League of Nations}}

The territories were governed by "Mandatory Powers", such as the [[United Kingdom]] in the case of the [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]] and the [[Union of South Africa]] in the case of [[South-West Africa]], until the territories were deemed capable of self-government. There were fourteen mandate territories divided up among the six Mandatory Powers of the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]. In practice, the mandate territories were treated as colonies and were regarded by critics as spoils of war.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} With the exception of [[Iraq]], which joined the League on [[3 October]] [[1932]], these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the [[Second World War]], a process that did not end until 1990. Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories]].

In addition to the Mandates, the League itself governed the [[Saarland]] for 15 years, before it was returned to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] following a plebiscite, and the [[Free City of Danzig|free city of Danzig]] (now [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) from [[15 November]] [[1920]] to [[1 September]] [[1939]].

==Resolving territorial disputes==

The aftermath of [[World War One]] left many issues to be settled between nations, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the first three years of the 1920s, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil that resulted from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 70–72</ref>  

As the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s, it became the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.<ref>Henig 1973, p. 170.</ref>

[[Image:Plebiscyt plakat.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Polish poster from the plebiscite in Upper Silesia in 1921]]

The Allied Powers referred the problem of [[Upper Silesia]] to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute.<ref>Scott 1973, pp. 82–83</ref> After the First World War, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of [[Prussia]]. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a [[plebiscite]] in Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should be part of [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to [[riot]]ing and eventually to the first two [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on [[20 March]] [[1921]] with 59.6% (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the [[Third Silesian Uprising]] in 1921.<ref>Osmanczyk and Mango 2002, p. 2568</ref> On [[12 August]] [[1921]], the League was asked to settle the matter, and the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 88</ref> The committee recommended that Upper Silesia should be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas. For example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependency of the two areas.<ref>Scott 1973, pp. 83</ref> In November 1921 a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's [[mineral]] resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area lasting until the run up to the Second World War.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 88</ref>

===Albania===
The frontiers of [[Albania]] had not been set during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, being left to the League to be decided, but had not yet been determined by September 1921. This created an unstable situation with [[Greece|Greek]] troops repeatedly crossing into Albanian territory on military operations in the south and [[Yugoslavia]]n forces engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, far into the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region and in November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913 with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 103–105</ref>

The borders of Albania again become the cause of international conflict when [[Italy|Italian]] General [[Enrico Tellini]] and four of this assistants were ambushed and killed on [[24 August]] [[1923]] while marking out the new newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was incensed, and demanded that a commission should be set up to investigate the incident and that its enquires should be completed within five days. Whatever the results of the enquiry, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government should pay Italy fifty million [[Italian lira|lira]] reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 86</ref>

Mussolini sent a [[warship]] to shell the Greek island of [[Corfu]] and Italian forces [[Corfu incident|occupied Corfu]] on [[31 August]] [[1923]]. This contravened the League's covenant so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allies, however, agreed (under Musolini's insistence) that the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini.  The League Council examined the dispute but then passed their findings to the Council of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations forcing Greece to pay fifty million [[Italian lira|lira]] to Italy even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 87</ref> Mussolini was able to leave Corfu in triumph.

===Åland Islands===
{{main|Åland crisis}}

[[Åland]] is a collection of around 6,500 islands midway between [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The islands are exclusively [[Swedish language|Swedish]] speaking, but in 1809, Sweden had lost both Finland and the Åland islands to [[Imperial Russia]]. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian [[October Revolution]], Finland declared independence, and most of the Ålanders wished the islands to become part of Sweden again;<ref name="Scott60">Scott 1973, p. 60</ref> The Finnish government, however, felt that the islands were part of their new nation, as the Russians had included Åland in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to a level that meant there was a danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland did not let the League intervene as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if the League should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created.<ref name="Scott60"/> In June 1921, the League announced its decision; the islands should remain a part of Finland but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarization. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 77–78</ref>

===Memel===
{{main|Klaipėda Revolt}}
The port city of [[Klaipėda|Memel]] (now [[Klaipėda]]) and [[Klaipėda Region|the surrounding area]], with a predominantly [[Germany|German]] population, were under Allied control after the end of the World War I. The area had been awarded to [[Lithuania]] by Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles but the French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an international city.  By 1923, control of the area had still not been transferred to Lithuania, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port.  After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations.  In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry to invesitage. The Commission chose to cede the Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights.  This was approved by the League Council on [[14 March]] [[1924]] and then by the Allied Powers and Lithuania.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 107</ref>

===Mosul===
The League resolved a dispute between [[Iraq]] and [[Turkey]] over the control of the former Ottoman province of [[Mosul]] in 1926. According to the British, who were awarded a League of Nations [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|A-mandate over Iraq]] in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic [[heartland]]. A League of Nations' Commission of Inquiry with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members was sent to the region in 1924 to study the case and found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of Turkey or Iraq but if they had to choose would pick Iraq.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 133</ref> In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British would hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to assure the autonomous rights of the [[Kurd]]ish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and it decided on [[16 December]] [[1925]] to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations' arbitration in the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923, it rejected the League's decision questioning the Council's authority.  The matter was referred to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] which ruled that when the Council made a unanimous decision it must be accepted.  Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on [[5 June]] [[1926]], that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq.  It was agreed, however, that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admittance.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 107-108</ref><ref>Scott 1973, p. 131-135</ref>

===Vilna===
{{main|Żeligowski's Mutiny}}
After World War I, Poland and [[Lithuania]] both regained their independence but there was disagreement about the frontiers between the countries.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 78</ref>  During the [[Polish-Soviet War]], Lithuania signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers.  This agreement gave control of the city of [[Vilnius|Vilna]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), the old Lithuanian capital, to Lithuania which became the country's seat of government.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 61</ref>  This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland led to fears that they would go to war, and on [[7 October]] [[1920]] the League negotiated a short-lived armistice<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 78</ref>  The majority of the population of the city of Vilna during the inter-war era were Polish and on [[9 October]] [[1920]] General [[Zeligowski]] with a Polish military force took the city and claimed that the Government of Central Lithuania was now under their protection.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 78</ref>

Lithuania requested the League's assistance and in response, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish Government indicated they would comply with the League, but rather than leaving, it reinforced the city with more Polish troops.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 62</ref> This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilna should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. Several League nations, included France and Britain, started preparing troops to be sent to the area as part of the international force. At the end of 1920, [[Polish-Lithuanian War|hostilities between Poland and Lithuania]] increased again but early in 1921, the Polish government began to seek a peaceful settlement. It agreed to support the League's plan for the area, withdraw Polish troops and co-operate with the plebiscite. The League, however, now faced opposition from Lithuania and the Soviet Union, who opposed of any international force in Lithuania.  In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite and the international force, and returned to attempting to facilitate a negotiated settlement between the two sides.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 63</ref> Vilna and the surrounding area were formally annexed by Poland in March 1922, and on [[14 March]] [[1923]], the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland leaving Vilna within Poland.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 78-79</ref> Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927.<ref>Bell 2007, p. 29</ref>  It was not until the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]] that Lithuania resolved diplomatic relations with Poland, ended the state of war, and thus ''de facto'' accepted the borders of its neighbour.<ref>Crampton 1996, p. 93</ref>

===Colombia and Peru===
[[Image:Guerra peru2 1932 d.jpg|thumb|right|The Colombian Army countering a Peruvian attack]]
{{main|Colombia-Peru War}}

There were several border conflicts between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the [[Salomón-Lozano Treaty]] to try and resolve these conflicts.<ref>Osmanczyk and Mango 2002, p. 1314</ref>  As part of this treaty, the border town [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]] and its surrounding area were ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the [[Amazon River]].<ref>Scott 1973, p. 249</ref>  On [[1 September]] [[1932]], business leaders from the Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land when the area was given to Colombia, organised an armed takeover of Leticia.<ref>Bethell 1991, pp. 414-415</ref>  At first, the Peruvian Government did not recognise the military takeover but Peru's President [[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro|Luis Cerro]] decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The Peruvian Army occupied Leticia, resulting in an armed conflict between the two nations.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 250</ref> After months of diplomatic wrangling, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the League's Council.  A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 251</ref> In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarization of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the [[Amazon River]] and [[Putumayo River]], and a pledge of non-aggression.

===Saar===
[[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was a province, formed from parts of [[Prussia]] and the [[Rhenish Palatinate]], that was established and placed under League control by the [[Treaty of Versailles]].  A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the region should belong to Germany or France.  When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3% of votes supported becoming part of Germany<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 72-73</ref><ref>Churchill 1986, p. 98</ref> On [[17 January]] [[1935]], the territory's re-integration with Germany was approved by the League Council.

==Peace and security==

In addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between (and even within) nations.  Among its successes were its attempts to combat the international trade in [[opium]] and [[sexual slavery]], and its work to alleviate the plight of [[refugee]]s, particularly in Turkey in the period to 1926.  One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the [[Nansen passport]], which was the first internationally recognized identity card for stateless refugees. Many of the League's successes were accomplished by its various agencies and commissions.

===Greece and Bulgaria===
{{main|Incident at Petrich}}
After [[an incident]] between sentries on the border between [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]] in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 112</ref> Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria.  The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to provide only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League to settle the dispute.<ref>Scott 1973, pp. 126-127</ref> The League did indeed condemn the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria. Greece complied, but complained about the disparity between their treatment and that of [[Italy]] after the [[Corfu incident]].

===Liberia===
Following accusations of [[forced labor]] on the massive American-owned [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] rubber plantation and American accusations of [[slave trade|slave trading]], the [[Liberia]]n government asked the League to launch an investigation.<ref name=Miers140-141>Miers 2003, pp. 140-141</ref>   The commission created to investigate was jointly appointed by the League, the [[United States of America]], and Liberia.<ref name=Miers>Miers 2003, p. 188</ref> In 1930, a report by the League confirmed [[slavery]] and forced labor was taking place.  The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labor and recommended that they be replaced by [[Europe]]ans or Americans.  The Liberian government outlawed forced labor and slavery and asked for American help, this created anger within Liberia and led to the resignation of President [[Charles D.B. King]] and his vice-president.<ref name=Miers/> The League then threatened to establish a trusteeship over Liberia unless reforms were carried out, enacting these reforms then became the central focus of President [[Edwin Barclay]].{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

===Mukden Incident===
{{main|Mukden Incident}}
[[Image:IJA troops enter Mukden.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] [[18 September]] [[1931]]]]
The [[Mukden Incident]], also known as the "Manchurian Incident" or the "Far Eastern Crisis", was one of the League's major setbacks and acted as the catalyst for [[Japan]]'s withdrawal from the organization.  Under the terms of an agreed lease, the Japanese government had the right to station its troops in the area around the [[South Manchurian Railway]], a major trade route between the two countries, in the [[China|Chinese]] region of [[Manchuria]].<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 138</ref> In September 1931, a section of the railway lightly damaged by officers and troops of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]],<ref name=Iriye>Iriye 1987, p.8</ref><ref name=scott208>Scott 1973, p. 208</ref> as a pretext for an invasion of Manchuria.<ref name=Iriye/><ref>Nish 1977, p.176-178</ref> The Japanese army, however, claimed that Chinese soldiers had [[sabotage]]d the railway and in apparent retaliation (acting contrary to the civilian government's orders<ref name=scott208/>) occupied the entire region of Manchuria. They   renamed the area [[Manchukuo]], and on [[9 March]] [[1932]], set up a puppet government with [[Pu Yi]], the former emperor of China, as its executive head.<ref>Northedge 1986, p.139</ref> Internationally, this new country was recognised only by the governments of Italy and Germany; the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China. In 1932, Japanese air and sea forces bombarded the Chinese city of [[Shanghai]], sparking the short war of the [[January 28 Incident]].

The League of Nations agreed to a request for help from the Chinese government, but the long voyage by ship delayed League officials from investigating the matter. When they arrived, the officials were confronted with Chinese assertions that the Japanese had invaded unlawfully, while the Japanese claimed they were acting to keep peace in the area. Despite Japan's high standing in the League, the subsequent [[Lytton Report]] declared Japan to be in the wrong and demanded Manchuria be returned to the Chinese. Before the report could be voted upon by the Assembly, Japan announced its intention to push further into China. The report passed 42-1 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voted against), but instead of withdrawing its troops from China, Japan withdrew its membership from the League.

According to the Covenant of the League of Nations, the League should have responded by placing economic sanctions on Japan, or gathered an army and declared war. Neither of these actions was undertaken. The threat of economic sanctions would have been almost useless because the United States was not a League member.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} Any economic sanctions the League placed on its member states would have been ineffective, as a country barred from trading with other member states could simply turn and trade with the United States. The League could have assembled an army but major powers like as Britain and France were too preoccupied with their own affairs, such as keeping control of their extensive colonies, especially after the turmoil of [[World War I]].{{Fact|date=June 2008}} Japan was therefore left in control of Manchuria, until the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] took over the area and returned it to China at the end of [[World War II]].

===Chaco War===
{{main|Chaco War}}
The League failed to prevent the 1932 war between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the arid [[Gran Chaco]] region of [[South America]].  Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the [[Paraguay River]] which would have given one of the two [[landlocked]] countries access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]],<ref>Scott 1973, p. 242-243</ref> and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of [[petroleum]].<ref>Levy 2001, pp. 21-22</ref> Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932, when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio López at [[Lake Pitiantuta]].<ref>Bethell 1991, p.495</ref>  Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the [[Pan-American conference]] offered to mediate instead.  The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 248</ref>  It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on [[12 June]] [[1935]], Paraguay had seized control over most of the region.<ref>Scheina 2003, p. 103</ref> This was recognized in a 1938 truce by which Paraguay was awarded three-quarters of the Chaco Boreal.

===Italian invasion of Abyssinia===
{{main|Abyssinia Crisis|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}
[[Image:Italian troops march past billboard of Mussilini during 1936 invasion.jpg|thumb|right|Italian troops during the invasion of Abyssinia]]

In October 1935, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] sent 400,000 troops to invade [[Abyssinia]] (Ethiopia).<ref name="Northedge22225">Northedge 1986, pp. 222–25</ref>  Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]] led the campaign from November 1935, ordering bombing, the use of [[chemical warfare|chemical weapons]] like [[mustard gas]], and the poisoning of water supplies, against targets which included undefended villages and medical facilities.<ref>Hill and Garvey 1995, p. 629</ref><ref name="Northedge22225"/> The modern [[Italian Army]] defeated the poorly armed Abyssinians, and captured [[Addis Ababa]] in May 1936, forcing Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] to flee.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 221</ref> 

The League of Nations condemned Italy's aggression and imposed economic sanctions in November 1935, but the sanctions were largely ineffective since they did not ban the sale of oil or close the [[Suez Canal]] (controlled by Britain).<ref>Baer 1976, p. 245</ref> As [[Stanley Baldwin]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], later observed, this was ultimately because no one had the military forces on hand to withstand an Italian attack.<ref name = "events">{{cite book|last=Library of Congress|title=Events Leading Up to World War II|publisher=Library of Congress|date=1944|pages=p. 97}}</ref> In October 1935, the [[President of the United States of America|American President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (a non-League member) invoked the American 1935 [[Neutrality Act]] and placed an embargo on arms and ammunition with both sides, but extended a "moral embargo" on the belligerent Italians further, including other trade items. On [[5 October]] and later on [[29 February]] [[1936]] the United States endeavoured, with uncertain success, to limit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels.<ref>Baer 1976, p. 71</ref> The League sanctions were lifted on [[4 July]] [[1936]], but by that point Italy had already gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia.<ref>Baer 1976, p. 298</ref>

In December 1935, the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] was an attempt by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]], [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] and [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Laval]] to end the conflict in Abyssinia by drawing up a plan to partition the country into two parts: an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the Pact; however, news of the Pact was leaked and both the British and French public venomously protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia.  Hoare and Laval were forced to resign their positions, and both the British and French governments disassociated from them.<ref>Baer 1976, pp. 121-55</ref>  In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, the Emperor of Ethiopia [[Haile Selassie I]] spoke to the Assembly to appeal for its help in protecting his country.<ref>{{Cite web | author=[[Haile Selassie I]] | title =Appeal to The League of Nations:June 1936, Geneva, Switzerland| publisher =Black King | url =http://www.black-king.net/haile%20selassie%2001e.htm| accessdate =2008-06-06}}</ref>

As was the case with Japan, the vigour of the major powers in responding to the crisis in Abyssinia was tempered by their perception that the fate of this poor and far-off country, inhabited by non-Europeans, was not a central interest of theirs.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} In addition, it showed how the League could be influenced by the self-interest of its members;<ref>Baer 1976, p. 303</ref> one of the reasons why the sanctions were not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and [[Adolf Hitler]] into an alliance.<ref>Baer 1976, p. 77</ref>

===Spanish Civil War===
{{main|Spanish Civil War}}
On [[17 July]] [[1936]], the [[Spanish Army]] launched a [[coup d'état]] leading to a prolonged armed conflict between Spanish [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] (the leftist government of Spain) and the Nationalists, conservative, anti-communist rebels who included most officers of the Spanish Army.<ref>Lannon 2002, pp. 25-29</ref> [[Alvarez del Vayo]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Spain)|Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs]], appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend its territorial integrity and political independence. The League members, however, would not intervene in the [[Spanish Civil War]] nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. Hitler and Mussolini continued to aid [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]’s Nationalist insurrectionists, and the [[Soviet Union]] aided the Spanish loyalists. In February 1937, the League did launch a ban on the intervention of foreign national [[International Brigades|volunteers]].

==Disarmament and failures en route to World War II==
Article eight of the League's covenant gave the League the task of reducing "armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations"<ref>{{Cite web | last =League of Nations | date=1924 | title =The Covenant of the League of Nations:Article 8 | publisher =The Avalon Project at Yale Law School | url =http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/leagcov.htm | accessdate =2006-05-17}}</ref> A significant amount of the League's time and energy was devoted to disarmament even though many member governments were uncertain that such extensive disarmament could be achieved or was even desirable.<ref name=northridge113>Northedge 1986, pp. 113 and 123</ref>  The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Power]]s were also under obligation from the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to attempt to disarm and the armament restrictions imposed on the defeated countries had been described as the first step toward world wide disarmament.<ref name=northridge113/> The League Covenant assigned the League the task of creating a disarmament plan for each state but the Council devolved this responsibility to a special commission set-up in 1926 to prepare for the 1932-34 [[World Disarmament Conference]].<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 114</ref>  Members of the League held different views towards disarmament.  The [[France|French]] were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked, [[Poland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] felt vulnerable to attack from the east and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed.<ref>Henig 1973, p. 173</ref>  Without this guarantee they would not reducing armaments because they felt the risk of attack from [[Germany]] would be too great.  Fear of attack increased as Germany regained strength after the First World War especially after [[Hitler]] gained power and became [[Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931 - 1933)|German Chancellor in 1933]].  In particular Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 114</ref>  

The World Disarmament Conference was convened by the League of Nations in [[Geneva]] in 1932 with representatives from 60 states.  A one year truce on the expansion of armaments, later extended by a few months, was proposed at the start of the conference.<ref>Goldblat 2002, p. 24</ref>  The Disarmament Commission obtained initial agreement from France, Italy, Japan, and Britain to limit the size of their navies. The [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], facilitated by the commission in 1928, failed in its objective of outlawing war. Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military build-up by Germany, Italy and Japan during the 1930s. The League mostly silent in the face of major events leading to World War II such as Hitler's [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland|re-militarisation of the Rhineland]], occupation of the [[Sudetenland]] and [[Anschluss]] of [[Austria]], which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, League members themselves re-armed. In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement, as did Germany in 1933 (using the failure of the [[World Disarmament Conference]] to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), and Italy in 1937. The League commissioner in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] was unable to deal with German claims on the city, a significant contributing factor in the outbreak of World War II in 1939.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} The final significant act of the League was to expel the [[Soviet Union]] in December 1939 after it [[Winter War|invaded Finland]].

==General weaknesses==

<small>Cartoon from [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] magazine, December 10 1920, satirising the gap left by the U.S.A when they did not join the League of Nations.</small>]]
The onset of the [[Second World War]] suggested that the League had failed in its primary purpose, which was to avoid any future world war. There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. 

===Origins and structure===
The origins of the League as an organisation created by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] as part of the peace settlement at the end of the first world war led to it being viewed as a "League of Victors".<ref>For example [[Georgy Chicherin]] cited in Gorodetsky 1994, p.26</ref><ref>Raffo 1974, p. 1</ref> It also tied the League to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] so that when the Treaty became discredited and unpopular, this reflected on the League of Nations.  

The League's supposed neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. The League required a unanimous vote of its nine, later fifteen, member Council to enact a resolution; conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions as certain decisions required unanimous consent of the entire Assembly.

===Global representation===
Representation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their time as part of the League was short. Most notably missing was the position that the [[United States of America]] was supposed to play in the League, not only in terms of helping to ensure world peace and security but also in financing the League.  The U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took but the [[United States Senate]] voted not to join on [[19 November]] [[1919]].<ref>Knock 1995, p. 263</ref>  [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]] has suggested that, had the United States been a member of the League, it would have also provided backup to [[France]] and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more regarding Germany and so made the rise to power of the [[Nazi]] party less likely.<ref name=Henig175>Henig 1973, p. 175</ref> On the contrary, Henig acknowledges that if America had been a member of the League, its reluctance to engage in war with European states and to enact economic sanctions may have hampered the ability of the League to deal with [[international incidents]].<ref name=Henig175/> The structure of [[Federal government of the United States|government in America]] may also have made its membership problematic as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the [[Executive branch|United States executive branch]] without this having already been approved by the [[United States Congress|legislative branches]].<ref>Henig 1973, p. 176</ref>

In January 1920, when the League began, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as the aggressor in World War I. Soviet Russia was also initially excluded from the League, as communist views were not welcomed by the victors of World War I.  The League was further weakened when critical powers left in the 1930s. [[Japan]] began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its invasion of the Chinese territory of [[Manchuria]].<ref>McDonough 1997, p. 62</ref> Italy also began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937. The League had accepted Germany as a member in 1926, deeming it a "peace-loving country", but [[Adolf Hitler]] pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.<ref>McDonough 1997, p. 69</ref>

===Collective security===
Another important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of [[collective security]], that formed the basis of the League, and [[international relations]] between individual states.<ref name=Northedge253>Northedge 1986, p. 253</ref>  The collective security system the League used meant that nations were required to act against states they considered friends, and in a way that might endanger their [[national interest]]s, to support states that they had no normal affinity with.<ref name=Northedge253/> This weakness was exposed during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] when Britain and France had to balance attempts to maintain the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe "in order to defend against the enemies of internal order",<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 254</ref> in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.<ref>Northedge 1986, pp. 253-254</ref>  

On [[23 June]] [[1936]], in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war of conquest against Abyssinia, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] told the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that [[collective security]] had {{quote|"failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... [T]he real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security."<ref name = "events" />}}

Ultimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of [[collective security]] in favour of [[appeasement]] in the face of growing German militarism under [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>McDonough 1997, p. 74</ref>

===Pacifism and disarmament===
[[Image:League of Nations cartoon from Punch - Project Gutenberg eText 16619.png|thumb|upright|left||'''Moral Suasion.'''<!--Sic - no typo, sorry, this is the original caption --><br />''The Rabbit''. "My offensive equipment being practically nil, it remains for me to fascinate him with the power of my eye."<br />

<small>Cartoon from [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] magazine, July 28 1920, satirising the perceived weakness of the League.</small>]]
The League United Nations, lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the [[power (international)|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions, which they were very reluctant to do.<ref>McDonough 1997, pp. 54-5</ref>  The League's two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after World War I, [[pacifism]] was a strong force both in the populations and the governments of the two countries. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] were especially tepid on the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of the organization.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} 

Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France and its other members while at the same time advocating collective security meant that the League was unwittingly depriving itself of the only forceful means by which its authority would be upheld. If the League was to force countries to abide by international law, it would require the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[French Army]] to do the enforcing. 

When the British Cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War, [[Maurice Hankey]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying: "Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us, because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious".<ref name="Barnett245">Barnett 1972, p. 245.</ref> He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:

{{quote|"It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage".<ref name="Barnett245"/>}}

The Foreign Office minister Sir [[Eyre Crowe]] also wrote a memorandum to the British Cabinet claiming that "a solemn league and covenant" would just be "a treaty, like other treaties": "What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?". Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned "pledge of common action" against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power. He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would ineffectual and that "It is all a question of real military preponderance". Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility, Crowe warned.<ref name="Barnett245"/>

==Demise and legacy==
[[Image:UN building, Genevra.jpg|right|thumb|The League of Nations' Assembly building in Geneva]]
As the situation in Europe deteriorated into war, the Assembly transferred enough power to the Secretary General on [[30 September]] [[1938]] and [[14 December]] [[1939]] to allow the League to continue to legally exist and to carry on reduced operations.<ref name="Magliveras31">Magliveras 1999, p. 31</ref> The headquarters of the League, the [[Palais des Nations|Palace of Peace]], remained unoccupied for nearly six years until the Second World War ended.<ref>Scott 1973, p. 399</ref> 

At the 1943 [[Tehran Conference]], the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to replace the League: the [[United Nations]].  Many League bodies, such as the [[International Labour Organization]], continued to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN.<ref name="ILO"/>  The structure of the United Nations was intended to make it more effective than the League.

The final meeting of the League of Nations was held in April 1946 in Geneva.  Delegates from 43 nations attended the assembly. This session concerned itself with liquidating the League: assets worth approximately $22,000,000 in 1946,<ref name="SyracuseHerald"/> including the Palace of Peace and the League's archives, were given to the UN, reserve funds were returned to the nations that had supplied them, and the debts of the League were settled.<ref name="Scott404">Scott 1973, p. 404</ref>  [[Robert Cecil]]  is said to have summed up the feeling of the gathering during a speech to the final assembly when he said:

{{quote|Let us boldly state that aggression wherever it occurs and however it may be defended, is an international crime, that it is the duty of every peace-loving state to resent it and employ whatever force is necessary to crush it, that the machinery of the Charter, no less than the machinery of the Covenant, is sufficient for this purpose if properly used, and that every well-disposed citizen of every state should be ready to undergo any sacrifice in order to maintain peace ... I venture to impress upon my hearers that the great work of peace is resting not only on the narrow interests of our own nations, but even more on those great principles of right and wrong which nations, like individuals, depend.<br />
The League is dead. Long live the United Nations<ref name="Scott404" />}}

The motion that dissolved the League passed unanimously: "The League of Nations shall cease to exist except for the purpose of the liquidation of its affairs."<ref>Motion of the League of Nations, quoted in Scott 1973, p. 404</ref> The motion also set the date for the end of the League as the day after the session was closed. On [[19 April]] [[1946]], the President of the Assembly, Carl J. Hambro of Norway, declared "the twenty-first and last session of the General Assembly of the League of Nations closed."<ref name="SyracuseHerald"> "League of Nations Ends, Gives Way to New U.N.", ''Syracuse Herald-American'', [[April 20]], [[1946]], p. 12 </ref>  As a result, the League of Nations ceased to exist on [[20 April]] [[1946]].<ref name="UNOGend">{{Cite web | title =The end of the League of Nations | publisher = The United Nations Office at Geneva | url =http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/02076E77C9D0EF73C1256F32002F48B3?OpenDocument | accessdate =2008-05-18}}</ref>  

Professor [[David Kennedy]], has suggested that the League is a unique moment when international affairs were "institutionalized" as opposed to the pre-World War I methods of law and politics.<ref>Kennedy 1987</ref> The principal [[Allies]] in World War II (the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], [[France]], the [[United States|U.S.]], and [[Republic of China|China]]) became permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]]; these new "Great Powers" gained significant international influence, mirroring the League Council. Decisions of the UN Security Council are binding on all members of the UN; however, unanimous decisions are not required, unlike the League Council. Permanent members of the UN Security Council are also given a shield to protect their vital interests, which has prevented the UN acting decisively in many cases. 

Similarly, the UN does not have its own standing armed forces, but the UN has been more successful than the League in calling for its members to contribute to armed interventions, such as during the [[Korean War]] and the [[peacekeeping]] mission in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. The UN has in some cases been forced to rely on economic sanctions. The UN has also been more successful than the League in attracting members from the nations of the world, making it more representative.
