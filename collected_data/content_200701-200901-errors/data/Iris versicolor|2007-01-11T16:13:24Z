'''''Iris versicolor''''', also commonly known as the '''Harlequin Blueflag''' the '''Blue Flag Iris''' and other varitations of those names, is a species of ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' native to North America where it is common in sedge meadows, marshes, and along streambanks and shores.

''I. versicolor'' is a perennial herb, usually 10-80 [[centimeter]]. high. This iris tends to form large clumps from thick, creeping [[rhizome]]s. The unwinged, erect [[plant stem|stem]]s generally have basal [[leaf|leave]]s that are more than 1 cm. wide. Leaves are folded on the midribs so that they form an overlapping flat fan. The well developed blue flower has 6 petals and sepals spread out nearly flat and have two forms. The longer sepals are hairless and have a greenish-yellow blotch at their base. The inferior ovary is bluntly angled. Flowers are usually light to deep blue and in bloom during May to July. Fruit is a 3-celled, bluntly angled capsule. The large seeds can be observed floating in the fall.

The species has been implicated in several poisoning cases of humans and animals who consumed the [[rhizome]]s, which have been found to contain a [[glycoside]], [[iridin]]. The [[Sap (plant)|sap]] can cause [[dermatitis]] in susceptible individuals.

The blue flag is the provincial flower of [[Quebec]], having replaced the [[Madonna lily]] which is not native to the province.
