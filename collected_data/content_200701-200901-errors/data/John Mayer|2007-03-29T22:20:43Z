'''John Clayton Mayer''' (born on [[October 16]], [[1977]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[singer-songwriter]] and [[guitarist]]. Originally from [[Connecticut]], he briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] before moving to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in [[1998]], where he refined his skills and began gaining a following. After originally performing mainly acoustic [[rock music|rock]], in [[2005]] he made a transition towards the [[blues]] genre with the formation of the [[John Mayer Trio]].  The blues influence can also be seen on his latest studio album ''[[Continuum (album)|Continuum]]'', which was released on [[September 12]], [[2006]].  Mayer won two Grammy awards for Pop Vocal Album for ''Continuum'' and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Waiting on the World to Change" at the 49th Grammy Awards in February 2007.

Mayer's other interests include [[stand-up comedy]], design, and writing; he has written pieces for several magazines, most notably for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.
==Early life==
Born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], Mayer grew up in nearby [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], the second of three sons.<ref name=ELLE>Ruth Shaut (''[[ELLE]]'')(2006).[http://jmeyecandy.org/displayimage.php?album=380&pos=1 "Blues Brother"] J-mayer.org (accessed August 3, 2006)</ref> There, he became friends with future tennis star [[James Blake]].<ref>http://www.fhmus.com/articles-2064.asp</ref> Mayer attended [[Fairfield Warde High School|Fairfield High School]] (now Fairfield Warde High School) for most of high school, although he attended [[Brien McMahon High School]] in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] for his [[junior year]], where he was enrolled in the [[Center for Global Studies at Brien McMahon High School]]. Then known as the Center for Japanese Studies Abroad, it is a [[magnet school|magnet program]] for students in Fairfield County wanting to learn Japanese.  

Mayer listened to pop music, but it was not until the age of thirteen that his aspiration for playing the [[guitar]] was realized, and his father rented one for him.<ref>He was inspired by the Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) guitar performance in Back to The Future.[http://www.pbs.org/wttw/soundstage/jmayer/bio.htm]</ref><ref name=AskMen> (2005). [http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_100/140c_john_mayer.html "Men Of The Week: Entertainment - John Mayer"] ''AskMen.com'' (accessed April 12, 2006)</ref>  On [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]], Mayer confessed that he had played the [[clarinet]] for a while in grammar school, with minor success.

Generally, it was believed that Mayer's father, a [[Bridgeport High School]] principal, had given him a confiscated tape player that contained an album by [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]].  However, Mayer, in a 2006 interview on the New Zealand show ''[[Close Up]]'' said the cassette was given to him by a neighbor, sparking Mayer's love of the [[blues]].<ref name=CU>(2006) [http://images.tvnz.co.nz/tvnz_video/windows/tv_one/meyer_061106_56k.asx "Mon Nov 6: Telecom; Spam Attack; John Mayer"] TVNZ online (accessed December 6, 2006)</ref> After two years of practice, he started playing at blues [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s and other venues in the area.<ref name=AskMen /> While in high school, he was in a band called Villanova Junction with Joe Beleznay, Tim Procaccini, and Rich Wolf.<ref name=TW>Wallace, William (2005).

When Mayer was seventeen, he was suddenly stricken with a [[cardiac arrhythmia]] that sent him to the hospital for a weekend.  The trauma of the incident sparked his songwriting, and he penned his first lyrics the night he got home.  Shortly thereafter, he began suffering from crippling [[panic attacks]] and even now he keeps [[Xanax]] (an anti-anxiety drug) with him, just in case.<ref name=RS06>Hiatt, Brian (2006).

==Career==
===Road to mainstream success===

After playing the guitar for several years, Mayer enrolled in the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], at the age of nineteen.<ref name=ELLE/> After two semesters, he chose to cut his studies short in favor of a move to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], with his college friend and bandmate, Clay Cook. They began their career in earnest there, quickly making a name for the two-man band, LoFi Masters.  They frequented the local [[coffeehouse]] and club circuit in venues like [[Eddie's Attic]].<ref name=AskMen/> After the band LoFi Masters split due to creative differences, Mayer began his solo career.  With the help of local producer/engineer Glenn Matullo, Mayer recorded the independent EP ''[[Inside Wants Out]]''.  Cook is also cited as the co-writer of many of the songs from the album, most notably, the ballad "Comfortable."<ref name=MOA>Guthrie, Blake (2003). [http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A14103 "Mayer of Atlanta: John Mayer plays Philips Arena, and all I got was this lousy cover story"] CreativeLoafing.com (accessed February 17, 2007)</ref> 

The EP ultimately contributed to Mayer being signed to [[Aware Records]], and two years later, in early 2001, he released an internet-only version of ''[[Room for Squares]]'' through Aware.  During that time, Aware inked a deal with [[Columbia Records]] which gave Columbia first shot at picking up Aware artists, and thus, in September of the same year, Columbia remixed and re-released ''Room for Squares'' (artwork was also updated/changed, as well as adding 3x5, which didn't appear on the original).  This "debut" included several of the songs that had been previously released on his indie release.  By the end of 2002, ''Room for Squares'' had spawned several radio hits, including "No Such Thing," "[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]," and, ultimately, "[[Why Georgia]]" as a radio-only single.  In 2003, he won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for the 2002 release of "Your Body Is a Wonderland." In his acceptance speech, he remarked, "This is very, very fast, and I promise to catch up."<ref>Bream, Jon (2007). [http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/music/16653977.htm "Win or lose, John Mayer says his work keeps him happy"] MercuryNews.com (accessed February 23, 2007)</ref> 

In 2003, Mayer released the follow-up album, ''[[Heavier Things]]''.  This album also brought critical and commercial success. Although the album did top the charts for a time, it ultimately did not sell as well as ''Room for Squares.''  However, Mayer's most successful single to date, "[[Daughters (John Mayer song)|Daughters]]," yielded Mayer a Grammy for [[Song of the Year]] in 2005.  For this award, he beat contenders [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Kanye West]]. He dedicated the award to his grandmother, Annie Hoffman, who died in May 2004. He also won [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]], beating [[Elvis Costello]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] for the Award.  Mayer also was honored with the Hal David Starlight Award (previously the Starlight Award) at the 37th Annual [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] Induction Ceremony in 2006.<ref>(2006).

===Change in musical direction===
{{Sound sample box align left|Music sample:}}{{listen|filename=Common - Go.ogg|title="Go!" excerpt|description=From the album ''Be''|format=[[Ogg]]}}{{Sample box end}}In 2004, Mayer worked with [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist and producer [[Kanye West]],  appearing both on rapper [[Common (rapper)|Common]]'s song "Go!" and being included initially on West's album ''Late Registration'', though their collaboration "Bittersweet"  remains [[as of 2007|unreleased]]. Due to these collaborations, Mayer has received praise from rap heavyweights like [[Jay-Z]] and [[Nelly]]. When asked about his presence in the hip hop community, he said that, "It's not music out there right now. That's why, to me, hip-hop is where rock used to be."<ref name=trio>Moss, Corey (2005) [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495325/01052005/mayer_john.jhtml "John Mayer Plans To 'Close Up Shop On Acoustic Sensitive'"] ''MTV.com'' (accessed April 12, 2006)</ref>

It was around this time that Mayer began hinting a change in his musical interests, announcing that he was "closing up shop on acoustic sensitivity."<ref name=trio/> In 2005, he began a string of collaborations with various important and provocative blues artists, including [[Buddy Guy]], [[B.B. King]], [[Eric Clapton]], and jazz artist [[John Scofield]]. He also toured with legendary jazz pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], which included a show at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in [[Manchester, Tennessee|Manchester]], [[Tennessee]]. These collaborations led to recordings with several of these artists, namely,  Clapton (''[[Back Home (Eric Clapton album)|Back Home]]'', [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]]), Guy (''[[Bring 'Em In (Buddy Guy album)|Bring 'Em In]])'', Scofield (''[[That's What I Say (John Scofield album)|That's What I Say]]'') and King (''[[80 (album)|80]]'').

Although Mayer has maintained a reputation for being a sensitive, meticulous [[singer-songwriter]], he has also gained distinction as an accomplished [[guitarist]], influenced by the likes of the above artists, as well as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and [[Freddie King]].<ref name=RSGG>[[Fricke, David]] (2007).

===John Mayer Trio===

{{Sound sample box align right|Music sample:}}{{listen|filename=Who Did You Think I Was.ogg|title="Who Did You Think I Was" excerpt|description=From the album ''Try!''|format=[[Ogg]]}}{{Sample box end}} In the spring of 2005, Mayer formed the [[John Mayer Trio]] with [[bassist]] [[Pino Palladino]] and [[drummer]] [[Steve Jordan (drummer)|Steve Jordan]], both of whom he had met through previous studio sessions. The trio played a combination of blues and rock music. In October 2005, the Trio opened for [[The Rolling Stones]] during a sold-out club tour of their own. In November 2005, they released a live album called ''[[Try! (John Mayer Trio album)|Try!]]'' The first single, "Who Did You Think I Was?," lyrically underscores Mayer's decision to move away from acoustic pop music.

The John Mayer Trio took a break in mid-2006.<ref>http://www.relix.com/cgi-bin/content_details.cgi?id=1787</ref> John declared at the end of their performance at the Tempe Music Festival in March of 2006, "This is Steve Jordan, that's Pino Palladino, and I'm John Mayer. And for a few more minutes, we are the John Mayer Trio." On September 12, however, he announced plans for the Trio to begin work on a studio album.<ref name=contsup>Mayer, John (2006).

===''Continuum'' and beyond===
{{main|Continuum (album)|l1=Continuum}}

[[Image:Jm_wotwtc.jpg|thumb|left|135px|Cover art for the single "Waiting on the World to Change," the first from the album ''[[Continuum (album)|Continuum]]''.]]
Mayer's latest album, entitled ''[[Continuum (album)|Continuum]]'', was released on [[September 12]], [[2006]], and was produced by Mayer himself and John Mayer Trio drummer Steve Jordan. Mayer suggested the album was intended to combine his signature pop music with the feel, sound, groove and sensibilities of the blues. In that vein, two of the tracks from his trio release ''Try!'' — the funky "Vultures" and the blues centrepiece "Gravity" — also were included on ''Continuum''. <!-- "Mayer also played a secret one-off show at the Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles on April 10, 2006, with John Mayer Trio bassist Pino Palladino, where they played the majority of the new songs from ''Continuum''." - I've removed this as on this date, I have a video of the trio playing a set at the hotel cafe, but the only song from Continuum is Gravity, but no others. Either the date is wrong or the entire note is false. -->

The first single from ''Continuum'' was "[[Waiting on the World to Change]]," which debuted on ''[[The Ron and Fez Show]]''.  The song was the third most downloaded song of the week on the [[iTunes Music Store]] following its release on [[July 11]], [[2006]], and debuted at #25 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Chart. On [[August 23]], 2006, Mayer debuted the entire album on the [[Los Angeles]] radio station [[KYSR|Star 98.7]], giving commentary on each and every track. A subsequent version was released the next day on the [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel Music]] website as a streaming sneak preview.  On [[September 22]], 2006, Mayer appeared on ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', playing live (albeit abridged) versions of "Waiting on the World to Change" and another track from ''Continuum'', "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room."

On December 7, 2006, the 2007 Grammy nominees were announced. Mayer was nominated for five Grammys including the prestigious Album of the Year. John Mayer Trio also received a nomination for their album ''Try!''.  He won two: Best Pop Song with Vocal for "Waiting on the World to Change" and Best Pop Album for ''Continuum''.

In a December blog entry Mayer announced he had begun writing new material.<ref>Mayer, John (2006). [http://www.johnmayer.com/blog/john/200612#231 "THE NEXT TRANSMISSION"] JohnMayer.com (accessed December 11, 2006)</ref>  He has also indicated that he's in the studio experimenting with music in a sort of a blend of [[jazz]] (mentioning [[Elvin Jones]] as inspiration) and [[Pop (music)|pop]] — aiming to produce what he calls today's "modern music," as jazz was once called.<ref name=BTW>Mayer, John (2007). [http://www.johnmayer.com/blog#247 "BACK TO WORK, THEN!"] JohnMayer.com (accessed January 28, 2007)</ref>

Mayer remixed an acoustic version of his single, "Waiting on the World to Change" with vocal additions from fellow musician [[Ben Harper]]. In preparation for recording ''Continuum'', Mayer booked the [[Village Recorder]] in Los Angeles to record five demo acoustic versions of his songs with veteran musician Robbie McIntosh. This was released on December 12, 2006 as an [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[The Village Sessions]]''. As usual, Mayer oversaw the artwork of the release.

He was named as one of the "New Guitar Gods" and the cover nicknamed him "Slowhand, Jr.," a reference to Eric Clapton.<ref name=RSGG/>

===Other projects===
In 2003, [[Martin Guitars]] gave Mayer his own signature model acoustic guitar called the OM-28 John Mayer.<ref name=OM-28>(2003).

[http://www.martinguitar.com/artists/display_artist.php?d=245 "John Mayer Signature OM"] MartinGuitar.com (accessed January 29, 2007)</ref> This acoustic was followed by the release of a signature Stratocaster electric guitar by [[Fender]] guitars in 2005 — three different models in total. Unlike the Martin, two of Mayer's Signature Fender Stratocasters are not limited edition models, and can be found at many Fender dealers. The third Stratocaster, finished in charcoal frost metallic paint with racing stripe, was limited to only 100 guitars. In August 2006, Fender started manufacturing SERIES II John Mayer strats. The new Olympic white with mint green pickguard and cream plastics replaced the shoreline gold model.<ref>Mayer, John (2006).

Mayer appeared in a one-shot half-hour comedy special on [[VH1]], entitled ''John Mayer Has a TV Show'' (2004).  Mayer wears a bear suit and anonymously chats with concertgoers in the parking lot outside one of his concerts, mispronouncing his last name and poking fun at his own image. He conducts a fake focus group, in which he suggests that [[Richard Marx]] had written many of his songs and that he has sold out. He also spends a fair deal of time with special guest [[Trick Daddy]]. Other parts of the show include shaving the drum tech's head and antics at a CD signing event.

In the [[June 1]], [[2004]], issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Mayer began a column called "Music Lessons with John Mayer." Each article featured a lesson (some more scholarly than others) and his take on various topics, both of personal and popular interest. In the [[August 2005]] issue he invited readers to create music for orphaned lyrics he had written.<ref name=contest>Mayer, John (2005).

Mayer is also heavily interested in design.  His blog features a variety of his designs ranging from T-shirts, guitar totes and, most dear to his heart, sneakers. In August 2006, Mayer started JMltd, a minor clothing line of Mayer-themed merchandise that he has designed.  The products are currently available only at his shows, although he has said they will eventually be available online.<ref name=jmltd>Mayer, John (2006).

Stand-up comedy is a growing hobby of Mayer's.  He makes regular, though random, appearances at the famed [[Comedy Cellar]] when he is in New York.  He says that although it is risky, it helps him write better.<ref name=RS06/>

==Touring==
Mayer allows audio taping at most of his live performances, and he also allows for the non-commercial trading of those recordings.<ref name=policy> Mayer, John (2005).
