'''''Deinonychus''''' ([[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: [[General American|GA]] {{IPA|[daɪ.ˈna.ni.kəs]}}, [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] {{IPA|[daɪˈnɒnɪkəs]}}) ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''δεινος'', 'terrible' and ''ονυξ/ονυχος'', 'claw') was a [[genus]] of [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] [[dinosaur]]. This 3.4&nbsp;[[metre]] (11&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) long dinosaur lived during the early [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] ([[Aptian]] - [[Albian]] [[faunal stage|stages]], 121 to 98.9 [[Mya (unit)|million years ago]]). Fossils of the only named species ''(D. antirrhopus)'' have been recovered from the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Oklahoma]], though teeth that may belong to ''Deinonychus'' have been found much farther east in [[Maryland]].

Its name refers to the unusually large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each hind foot, which was probably held retracted while the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes. It was commonly thought that ''Deinonychus'' would kick with the sickle claw to slash at its prey but recent tests on reconstructions of similar ''[[Velociraptor]]'' talons suggest that the claw was used to stab, not slash. As in other dromaeosaurids, the tail was stiffened by a series of elongated bones and bone processes. This might have given ''Deinonychus'' greater balance and turning ability. In both the Cloverly and Antlers Formation, ''Deinonychus'' remains have been found closely associated with those of the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Teeth discovered associated with ''Tenontosaurus'' specimens imply it was hunted or at least scavenged upon by ''Deinonychus''.

[[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[John Ostrom]]'s study of ''Deinonychus'' in the late 1960s [[Dinosaur renaissance|revolutionized]] the way scientists thought about dinosaurs, igniting the debate on whether or not dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Before this, the popular conception of dinosaurs had been one of plodding, reptilian giants. Ostrom noted lightweight bones and stiffened tendons which revealed an active, agile predator.

==Description==
[[Image: Deinonychus-scale.png|right|thumb|200px|Size comparison of ''Deinonychus'' with a human.]]Based on the largest known specimens, ''Deinonychus''  could reach 3.4&nbsp;meters (11.1&nbsp;ft), with a maximum skull length of 410&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] (16.4&nbsp;[[inch|in]]), a hip height of 0.87&nbsp;meters (2.85&nbsp;ft), a maximum weight of 73&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kilograms]] (161&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]).<ref name=paul1988b>{{cite book|last=Paul |first=G.S. |year=1988 |title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |pages=366-369 }}</ref> Its skull was equipped with powerful jaws lined with around sixty curved, blade-like teeth. Studies of the skull show that the eyes faced mainly to the side. Both the skull and the lower jaw had [[fenestra]]e (skull openings) which reduced the weight of the skull. In ''Deinonychus'', the [[antorbital fenestra]], a skull opening between the eye and nostril, was particularly large.

Like all dromaeosaurs, ''Deinonychus'' possessed large [[Manus (zoology)|manus]] (hands) with three claws on each forelimb. The first digit was shortest and the second one longest. Each hind foot bore a sickle-shaped claw on this second digit, which was probably used during predation; these claws were unusually large for the body size of ''Deinonychus''. ''Deinonychus'' had a tail that was highly stiffened primarily by extensions of the tail [[vertebra]]e and [[chevron]]s; this allowed stability and balance while turning at high speeds.

The first remains were uncovered in 1931 in southern [[Montana]] near the town of [[Bridger, Montana|Bridger]]. The team leader, paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]], was primarily concerned with excavating and preparing the remains of the [[ornithopod]] dinosaur ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'', but in his field report from the dig site to the [[American Museum of Natural History]], he reported the discovery of a small carnivorous dinosaur close to a ''Tenontosaurus'' skeleton, "but encased in lime difficult to prepare."<ref name="grellet-tinner&makovicky2006">{{cite journal|last=Grellet-Tinner|first=G.|coauthors=and Makovicky, P. |year=2006 |title=A possible egg of the dromaeosaur ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'': phylogenetic and biological implications |journal=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=705-719}}</ref> He informally called the animal "Daptosaurus" and made preparations for describing it and having the skeleton put on display, but never finished this work.<ref name=NGD95>{{cite book |last=Norell |first=M.

S.; and Dingus, L. |title=Discovering Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=126-130 |isbn=0-679-43386-4}}</ref>  Brown brought back from the Cloverly Formation the skeleton of a smaller theropod with seemingly oversized teeth that he informally named "Megadontosaurus".  [[John Ostrom]], reviewing this material decades later, realized that the teeth came from ''Deinonychus'', but the skeleton came from a completely different animal.  He named this skeleton ''[[Microvenator]]''.<ref name=NGD95/> 

A little more than thirty years later, in August of 1964, paleontologists John Ostrom and Grant E. Meyer analyzed Brown's "Daptosaurus" in detail and published their findings in 1969, giving the remains the new name of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus''.<ref name="ostrom1969">{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=J. H.|year=1969|title=Osteology of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'', an unusual theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana |journal=Peabody Museum of Natural History Bulletin |volume=30 |pages=1-165}}</ref> "''antirrhopus''" means "counterbalancing" and refers to the animal's stiff tail's likely purpose. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the [[Type (zoology)|type]] specimen of ''Deinonychus'' was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual.<ref name="ostrom1969"/> The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at [[Yale University|Yale]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]]. 

A skeleton of ''Deinonychus'' including bones from the original (and most complete) specimen can be seen on display at the American Museum of Natural History,<ref>{{cite web | author = American Museum of Natural History | title = Deinonychus | work = http://www.amnh.org | publisher = American Museum of Natural History | date = 2007 | url = http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/expeditions/treasure_fossil/Fossils/Specimens/deinonychus.html
 | accessdate = 2007-07-13}}</ref> with another specimen on display at the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] at [[Harvard University]]. The American Museum and Harvard specimens are from a different locality than the Yale specimens.

===Further findings===
Following Ostrom's description of the original specimen uncovered by Brown, several small blocks of lime-encased material remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum. These consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments, including the original matrix, or surrounding rock in which the specimens were initially buried. An examination of these unprepared blocks by Gerald Grellet-Tinner and Peter Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures which helped stiffen the tail of ''Deinonychus'') turned out to actually represent [[Gastralium|gastralia]] (abdominal ribs). More significantly, a large number of previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix which had surrounded the original ''Deinonychus'' specimen.<ref name="makovicky&grellet-tinner2000">{{cite book|last=Makovicky|first=P. J. |coauthors= Grellet-Tinner, G. |year=2000 |chapter=Association between a specimen of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and theropod eggshell |editor= Bravo, A.M. and T. Reyes|title= First international symposium on dinosaur eggs and babies,Isona i Conca Dellà Catalonia, Spain, 23–26 September 1999| pages=123–128}}</ref>

In a subsequent, more detailed report on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky concluded that the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] almost certainly belonged to ''Deinonychus'', representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified.<ref name="grellet-tinner&makovicky2006"/> Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found in close contact with the gastralia suggesting that ''Deinonychus'' might have [[Avian incubation|brooded]] its eggs. This implies that ''Deinonychus'' used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an [[endothermy]] similar to modern birds.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grellet-Tinner|first=Gerard|year=2006|title=Oology And The Evolution Of Thermophysiology In Saurischian Dinosaurs: Homeotherm And Endotherm Deinonychosaurians? |journal=Papeis Avulsos de Zoologia |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1-10| url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0031-10492006000100001&script=sci_arttext| accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued.

===Implications===
[[Image:Archaeo-deinony hands.svg|thumb|right|200px|The similarity of the forelimbs of ''Deinonychus'' (left) and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' (right) led [[John Ostrom]] to revive the link between dinosaurs and birds.]]
The description in 1969 by Ostrom of ''Deinonychus'' has been described as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid 20th century.<ref name = "FasWeis04">{{cite book|author=Fastovsky, D.E., Weishampel, D.B. |title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs|edition= 2nd edition| year=2005 |chapter=Theropoda I: Nature Red in Tooth and Claw |editor=Fastovsky, D.E., Weishampel, D.B. |pages=265&ndash;299|location= Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press|id=ISBN 0-521-81172-4}}</ref>  The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been [[warm-blooded]]. This development has been termed the [[Dinosaur renaissance]]. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of ''Deinonychus'' and that of birds, which observation led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs.<ref name="ostrom1976b">{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=J. H. |year=1976 |title=''Archaeopteryx'' and the origin of birds |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=8 |pages=91-182}}</ref> Thirty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted. 

The discoveries of closely related dinosaurs from China bearing the remains of feather-like structures, ''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'' and ''[[Microraptor]]'', indicate that ''Deinonychus'' may have borne feathers as well.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Xu, X., Wang, X.L., and Wu, X.C. | date = [[16 September]] [[1999]] | title = A dromaeosaurid dinosaur with a filamentous integument from the Yixian Formation of China | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 401 | pages = 262–266| doi=10.1038/45769 }} ([http://www.geocities.com/earthhistory/fd.htm abstract])</ref> The features of these two dinosaurs suggest they were more primitive than ''Deinonychus'' on the Dromaeosaurid evolutionary tree, which, coupled with their greater age (both dinosaurs predate ''Deinonychus'' by around ten million years), strongly suggest that ''Deinonychus'' may also have been feathered.<ref name ="dinosauria04"/> Feathers impression have also been found with theropods even more distantly related to birds than ''Sinornithosaurus'' and ''Microraptor'', including ''[[Caudipteryx]]'', ''[[Shuvuuia]]'', ''[[Beipiaosaurus]]'' and ''[[Dilong]]'', giving further credence according to the [[phylogenetic bracketing]] principle, that all dromaesaurids were indeed feathered.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Prum |first=R. |coauthors=Brush, A.

==Paleoecology==
[[Image:Deinonychus-antirrhopus jconway.jpg|right|thumb|Feathered restoration of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus''.<br> Plumage based on related genera.]]
Geological evidence suggests that ''Deinonychus'' inhabited a [[floodplain]] or [[swamp|swamplike]] habitat.<ref name ="dinosauria04"/> The paleoenvironment of both the Cloverly Formation and the [[Antlers Formation]], in which remains of ''Deinonychus'' have been found, consisted of forests, [[River delta|deltas]] and lagoons, not unlike today's [[Louisiana]].<ref name="wedel2005"/>
Other dinosaurs it shared its world with include herbivorous dinosaurs such as the armoured ''[[Sauropelta]]'' and two ornithopods, ''[[Zephyrosaurus]]'' and the larger ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. In Oklahoma, the ecosystem of ''Deinonychus'' also includes the large theropod ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]'', the huge sauropod ''[[Sauroposeidon]]'', the crocodilian genus ''[[Goniopholis]]'' and the [[gar]] genus ''[[Lepisosteus]]''.<ref name="wedel2005">{{cite journal|last=Wedel|first=M.

==Paleobiology==
===Predatory behavior===
Based on the association of a number of ''Deinonychus'' [[skeleton]]s in a single quarry, and the fact that shed teeth of ''Deinonychus'' have been found alongside skeletons of the [[ornithopod]] dinosaur ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'', ''Deinonychus'' may have fed on that animal, and perhaps hunted it. Ostrom and Maxwell have even used this information to speculate that ''Deinonychus'' might have lived and hunted in packs.<ref name="maxwell&ostrom1995">{{cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=W. D. |coauthors=Ostrom, J.H. |year=1995 |title=Taphonomy and paleobiological implications of ''Tenontosaurus''-''Deinonychus'' associations|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=707-712}} ([http://www.vertpaleo.org/publications/jvp/15-707-712.cfm abstract])</ref> 

However, a recent study by Roach and Brinkman has put into question the cooperative pack hunting behavior of ''Deinonychus'', based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and the [[taphonomy]] of tenontosaur sites. Modern [[archosaur]]s ([[bird]]s and [[crocodile]]s) and [[komodo dragon]]s display little cooperative hunting; instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, or are drawn to previously-killed carcasses, where much conflict occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller komodos that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal is killed, it is [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalized]]. When this information is applied to the tenontosaur sites, it appears that what is found is consistent with ''Deinonychus'' having a komodo- or crocodile-like feeding strategy.  ''Deinonychus'' skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other ''Deinonychus''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roach|first=B.

[[Image:Deinonychus BW.jpg|270px|left|thumb|Illustration of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'',<br> sickle claw at lower right.]]
Despite being the most distinctive feature of ''Deinonychus'', the shape and curvature of the [[sickle]]-claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes.<ref name="ostrom1976">{{cite journal|last=Ostrom |first=J. H. |year=1976 |title=On a new specimen of the Lower Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' |journal=Breviora |volume=439 |pages=1-21}}</ref> Ostrom suggested that this difference in the size and shape of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation.

Ostrom originally speculated that ''Deinonychus'' gripped its prey with its talons while delivering disemboweling slashes with its sickle claws.<ref name ="ostrom1969"/> Later studies, however, have shown that the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Carpenter |first=K. |year=1998| title=Evidence of predatory behavior by carnivorous dinosaurs |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=135–144 |url=https://scientists.dmns.org/sites/kencarpenter/PDFs%20of%20publications/theropod%20predation.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref><ref name="manning2006">{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=P.

Parsons has shown that juvenile and sub-adult specimens of ''Deinonychus'' display some morphological differences with the adults. For instance, the arms of the younger specimens were proportionally longer than those of the adults, a possible indication of difference in behavior between young and adults.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Parsons |first=W. |coauthors=Parsons, K. |year=2006 |title=Morphology And Size Of An Adult Specimen Of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'', (Saurischia, Theropoda) |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=26 |issue=3 sup. |pages=109A}}</ref>

===Speed===
Dromaeosaurids, especially ''Deinonychus'', are often depicted as unusually fast-running animals in the popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that ''Deinonychus'' was fleet-footed in his original description.<ref name="ostrom1969"/> However, when first described, a complete leg of ''Deinonychus'' had not been found, and Ostrom's speculation about the length of the [[femur]] (upper leg bone) later proved to have been an overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the [[ratio]] of the femur to the [[tibia]] (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern, fleet-footed birds like the [[ostrich]], the foot-tibia ratio is .95. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs like ''[[Struthiomimus]]'', the ratio is .68, but in ''Deinonychus'', the ratio is .48. Ostrom stated that the "only reasonable conclusion" is that ''Deinonychus'' was not particularly fast compared to other dinosaurs, and certainly not as fast as modern flightless birds.<ref name="ostrom1976"/>

The low foot to lower leg ratio in ''Deinonychus'' is due partly to an unusually short [[metatarsus]] (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individual than in larger ones. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus may be related to the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features – the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc. – as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the ''Deinonychus'' leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles were used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of ''Deinonychus'' represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.<ref name="ostrom1976"/>

===Eggs===
The identification in 2000 of a probable ''Deinonychus'' egg associated with one of the original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure, nesting, and reproduction. In their 2006 examination of the specimen, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on the egg, or that the egg fragments had been associated with the ''Deinonychus'' skeleton by coincidence. They dismissed the idea that the egg had been a meal for the theropod, noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones, making it impossible that they represented contents of the animals stomach. In addition, the manner in which the egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial, and was broken by the fossilization process. The idea that the egg was randomly associated with the dinosaur were also found to be unlikely; the bones surrounding the egg had not been scattered or disarticulated, but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life, indicating that the area around and including the egg was not disturbed during preservation. The fact that these bones were belly ribs ([[gastralium|gastralia]]), which are very rarely found articulated, supported this interpretation. All the evidence, according to Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky, indicates that the egg was intact beneath the body of the ''Deinonychus'' when it was buried. It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in ''Deinonychus'' similar to that seen in the related [[troodontid]]s and [[oviraptorid]]s, or that the egg was in fact inside the [[oviduct]] when the animal died.<ref name="grellet-tinner&makovicky2006"/>

Examination of the ''Deinonychus'' egg's microstructure confirms that it belonged to a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with [[ornithischia]]n and [[sauropod]] eggs. Compared to other [[maniraptora]]n theropods, the egg of ''Deinonychus'' is more similar to those of [[oviraptorid]]s than to those of [[troodontid]]s, despite studies which show the later are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like ''Deinonychus''. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7&nbsp;cm (2.7&nbsp;in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2&nbsp;cm diameter of the largest ''[[Citipati]]'' (an oviraptorid) eggs; ''Citipati'' and ''Deinonychus'' also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of ''Citipati'' and ''Deinonychus'' eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.<ref name="grellet-tinner&makovicky2006"/>
