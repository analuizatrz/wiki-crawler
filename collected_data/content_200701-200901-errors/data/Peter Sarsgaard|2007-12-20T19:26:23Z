Sarsgaard originally wanted to become a football player, and took up ballet to help improve his coordination. After several concussions, he gave up football and became interested in writing and theatre.<ref name="Empathist3" />  It was at Washington University where he first discovered acting.  His first role was as the servant Lawrence in Molière's ''[[Tartuffe]]''.

===Career===
Sarsgaard's first role was a guest spot on ''[[Law & Order]]'' in 1995. He began his film career later that year with ''[[Dead Man Walking]]'', playing one of [[Sean Penn]]'s murder victims.<ref name="Horowitz">Horowitz, Josh (November 7, 2003), [http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/interviews/28.html BREAKING "GLASS" WITH PETER SARSGAARD], Moveiepoopshoot.com. Retrieved March 17, 2007.</ref> Sarsgaard followed this with parts in low-budget [[Independent film|indie]] films, such as ''[[Another Day in Paradise]]'', ''[[Subway Stories: Tales from the Underground]]'', ''[[Minor Details]]'', ''[[Desert Blue]]'', and ''[[Freak City]]'', as well as the ensemble period thriller ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1998 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]''. 

Sarsgaard first gained critical recognition in 1999, for ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', in which he plays a violent, [[homophobic]] thug who murders [[Hilary Swank]]'s [[transgender]] character, [[Brandon Teena]].<ref name="Rainbow"/>

Attracting further notice in the 2001 [[Wayne Wang]] film ''[[The Center of the World]]'', Sarsgaard has since proven himself a critical favourite in supporting roles. Other notable roles include a Russian sailor in ''[[K-19: The Widowmaker]]'', the meth addict Jimmy the Finn in ''[[The Salton Sea]]'' (2002), a [[bisexual]] university researcher in ''[[Kinsey]]'', a [[bisexual]] screenwriter in ''[[The Dying Gaul (film)|The Dying Gaul]]'', the sarcastic best friend to [[Zach Braff]]'s character in ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'', and an [[Federal Air Marshal Service|air marshal]] in ''[[Flightplan]]'' starring [[Jodie Foster]].

During the production of ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', in which he played a "gung-ho marine scout", Sarsgaard injured his knee and ribs.

Sarsgaard has also acted in the theater.  He is a member of [[Douglas Carter Beane]]'s [[New York City]]-based company, The Drama Department. He has appeared in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of ''Kingdom of Earth'' starring [[Cynthia Nixon]] and directed by [[John Cameron Mitchell]].  With the [[Signature Theatre Company]], he has appeared in a critically acclaimed revival of [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''[[Burn This]]'' opposite [[Elisabeth Shue]] and [[Horton Foote]]'s ''[[Laura Dennis]]''.

Sarsgaard hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on [[January 21]], [[2006]]. In his introductory monologue, he tried to point out that he was a nice guy despite his sometimes macabre roles. Video clips were then played of Sarsgaard scaring the ''SNL'' regulars, including one clip in which [[Kenan Thompson]] walks into a room to find Sarsgaard naked, reading a [[newspaper]] in the dark.  The [[SARS]] global scare was still fresh in many minds, and one of the skits included a promotion for the Peter Sarsgaard "SARS-Guard", a reference to the mania of facemasks worn in public by those fearing infection.

===Personal life===
Sarsgaard has dated burlesque dancer [[Dita Von Teese]] and model/actress [[Shalom Harlow]].<ref>''The Sun'',  [http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,5-2005220696,00.html Dita has explosive sex].

Sarsgaard and Gyllenhaal announced their engagement in April 2006. Their daughter, Ramona Sarsgaard, was born on [[October 3]], [[2006]].<ref>Hamm, Liza (October 4, 2003), [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1541965,00.html Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard Have a Girl], ''The People''.
