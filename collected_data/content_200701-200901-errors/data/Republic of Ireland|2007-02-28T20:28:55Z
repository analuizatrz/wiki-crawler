==Name==
{{main|Names of the Irish state}}
The [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]] provides that "the name of the state is Éire, or, in the [[English language]], Ireland".  However, the [[state]] is sometimes referred to as the "Republic of Ireland," in order to distinguish it from the island of Ireland.  The name ''Republic of Ireland'' came into use after the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] defined it as the description of the state in 1949 (the purpose of the act being to declare that the state was a [[republic]] rather than a form of [[constitutional monarchy]]). However, because this was a statutory provision, the constitutional name of "Ireland" remains the official ''name'' of the state, whilst "Republic of Ireland" is a ''description'' of the state. "Republic of Ireland" is also the accepted legal name of the state in the [[United Kingdom]] as per the [[Ireland Act 1949]].  Therefore it is the name ''Ireland'' that is used for official purposes such as treaties, government and legal documents, and membership of international organisations.  However with [[Irish language|Irish]] being named the [[European Union]]'s 21st official language in 2007; the state will be referred to in both constitutional official languages, the Irish and English languages, similarly to other countries such as Finland and Belgium using more than one language at {{abbr|EU|European Union}} level.  This means the label 'Éire Ireland' will be used on various signage and nameplates referring to the state.<ref>[http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/story.asp?j=187261558&p=y87z6zzEU&n=187262318 {{abbr|EU}} to call country 'Éire Ireland'], [http://www.irishexaminer.com/ Irish Examiner], [[27 June]] [[2006]].</ref>

The state is also known by many other names in English, such as {{lang|ga|''[[Éire]]''}}, ''[[Irish Free State|The Free State]]'' and the ''Twenty-six Counties''.  The use of {{lang|ga|Éire}} when speaking English in Ireland has become increasingly rare, not least due to historical condescending connotations.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Often in the United Kingdom the state is referred to as [[Southern Ireland]], though this term is used informally and was only used officially for a brief period in Irish history.  Irish people sometimes refer to the state as "The South" - it is not uncommon to hear Northern Irish people talking about going "down south". 

The state has had more than one official title.  The revolutionary state, declared in 1919 by the large majority of Irish [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of (the United Kingdom) Parliament]] elected in 1918, was known as the "[[Irish Republic]]"; when the state achieved {{lang|la|''de jure''}} independence in 1922, it became known as the "[[Irish Free State]]" (in the [[Irish language]] {{lang|ga|''Saorstát Éireann''}}), a name that was retained until 1937.

==History==
{{main|History of the Republic of Ireland}}
{{main|History of Ireland}}
The state known today as the Republic of Ireland came into being when 26 of the counties of [[Ireland]] seceded from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] ({{abbr|UK|United Kingdom}}) in [[1922]]. The remaining six counties remained within the {{abbr|UK}} as [[Northern Ireland]]. This action, known as the [[Partition of Ireland]], came about because of complex constitutional developments in the early twentieth century.

From [[1 January]] [[1801]] until [[6 December]] [[1922]], Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom]]. During the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] from 1845 to 1849 the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30 percent. One million Irish died of starvation and another 1.5 million emigrated, (see: {{cite journal|last=Mokyr|first = Joel|authorlink = Joel Mokyr|title = New Developments in Irish Population History 1700-1850|journal = Irish Economic and Social History|volume = xi|pages = 101-121|date = 1984}}) which set the pattern of emigration for the century to come and would result in a constant decline up to the 1960s. From 1874, but particularly from 1880 under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] moved to prominence with its attempts to achieve [[Devolution#Irish home rule|Home Rule]], which would have given all of Ireland some autonomy without requiring it to leave the United Kingdom. It seemed possible in 1911 when the [[House of Lords]] lost their veto, and [[John Redmond]] secured the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]. The [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] movement, however, had been growing since 1886 among Irish [[Protestant]]s, fearing that they would face discrimination and lose economic and social privileges if Irish [[Catholics]] were to achieve real political power. Though Irish unionism existed throughout the whole of Ireland, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of [[Ulster Unionists|Ulster]], where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. (Any tariff barriers would, it was feared, most heavily hit that region.) In addition, the Protestant population was more strongly located in Ulster, with unionist majorities existing in about four counties. Under the leadership of the [[Dublin]]-born [[Edward Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] and the northerner [[James Craig|Sir James Craig]] they became [[Ulster Defence Force|more militant]]. In 1914, to avoid rebellion in Ulster, the British [[Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]], with agreement of the leadership of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party#Home Rule succeeds|Irish Party]] leadership, inserted a clause into the bill providing for home rule for 26 of the 32 counties, with an as of yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area temporarily excluded. Though it received the [[Royal Assent]], the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]'s implementation was suspended until after the [[World War I|Great War]]. (The war at that stage was expected to be ended by 1915, not the four years it did ultimately last.) For the prior reasons of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war  Redmond and his Irish [[National Volunteers]] supported the Allied cause, and tens of thousands joined battalions of the [[10th (Irish) Division|10th]] and [[16th (Irish) Division]]s of the  [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]]. 

{{History of Ireland}}
In January 1919, after the December 1918 [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|general elections]], 73 of Ireland's 106 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] elected were [[Sinn Féin]] members who refused to take their seats in the [[British House of Commons]]. Instead, they set up an extra-legal Irish parliament called [[Dáil Éireann]]. [[First Dáil|This Dáil]] in January 1919 issued a [[Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] and proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]]. The Declaration was mainly a restatement of the 1916 [[Easter Proclamation|Proclamation]] with the additional provision that Ireland was no longer a part of the [[United Kingdom]]. Despite this, the new [[Irish Republic]] remained unrecognised internationally except by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[Russian SFSR|Russian Republic]]. Nevertheless the Republic's [[Aireacht]] (ministry) sent a delegation under [[Ceann Comhairle]] [[Sean T. O'Kelly]] to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], but it was not admitted. After the bitterly fought [[Anglo-Irish War|War of Independence]], representatives of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] and the Irish rebels negotiated the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1921 under which the British agreed to the establishment of an independent Irish State whereby the [[Irish Free State]] (in the [[Irish language]] ''Saorstát Éireann'') with [[Dominion|dominion status]] was created. The [[Dáil Éireann]] narrowly ratified the treaty.

The Treaty was not entirely satisfactory to either side. It gave more concessions to the Irish than the British had intended to give but did not go far enough to satisfy republican aspirations. The new Irish Free State was in theory to cover the entire island, subject to the proviso that six counties in the north-east, termed "Northern Ireland" (which had been created as a separate entity under the ''[[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]'') could opt out and choose to remain part of the United Kingdom, which they duly did. The remaining twenty-six counties became the [[Irish Free State]], a [[constitutional monarchy]] over which the British monarch reigned (from 1927 with the title [[monarchy in the Irish Free State|King of Ireland]]). It had a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], a [[bicameral]] parliament, a cabinet called the "Executive Council" and a prime minister called the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]].

The [[Irish Civil War]] was the direct consequence of the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-Treaty forces, led by [[Éamon de Valera]], objected to the fact that acceptance of the Treaty ''abolished'' the [[Irish Republic]] of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the "people have no right to do wrong". They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and that [[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]] would have to swear an oath of fidelity to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and his successors. Pro-Treaty forces, led by [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], argued that the Treaty gave "not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it".

At the start of the war, the [[Irish Republican Army]] ({{abbr|IRA}}) split into two opposing camps: a pro-treaty {{abbr|IRA|Irish Republican Army}} and an [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|anti-treaty {{abbr|IRA}}]]. The pro-Treaty {{abbr|IRA}} became part of the new [[Irish Army|National Army]]. However, through the lack of an effective command structure in the anti-Treaty {{abbr|IRA}}, and their defensive tactics throughout the war, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Collins]] and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army capable of overwhelming the anti-Treatyists. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed any doubts about the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty Irregulars, and the determination of the government to overcome them, contributed significantly to their defeat.

The National Army suffered 800 fatalities and perhaps as many as 4,000 people were killed altogether. As their forces retreated, the Irregulars showed a major talent for destruction and the economy of the Free State suffered a hard blow in the earliest days of its existence.

[[Image:Irishpopulation.png|400px|left|Irish population during the twentieth century.]]
On [[29 December]] [[1937]], a new constitution, the [[Constitution of Ireland]], came into force. It replaced the Irish Free State by a new state called simply "Ireland". Though this state's ''constitutional'' structures provided for a [[President of Ireland]] instead of a king, it was not technically a republic; the principal key role possessed by a head of state, that of symbolically representing the state internationally remained vested, in ''statute law'', in the King as an ''organ''. On [[21 December]] [[1948]], the Republic of Ireland Act declared a republic, with the functions previously given to the Governor-General acting on the behalf of the King given instead to the President of Ireland.

The Irish state had remained a member of the then-[[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] after independence until the declaration of a republic on 18 April 1949. Under Commonwealth rules declaration of a republic automatically terminated membership of the association; since a reapplication for membership was not made, Ireland consequently ceased to be a member.

The Republic of Ireland joined the [[United Nations]] in 1955 and the [[European Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful reunification of Ireland and have usually cooperated with the [[British government]] in the violent conflict involving many [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and the [[British Army]] in Northern Ireland known as "[[The Troubles]]". A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, the [[Belfast Agreement]], was approved in 1998 in referenda north and south of the border, and is currently being implemented, albeit more slowly than many would like.

==Politics==
[[Image:Mary McAleese.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[President of Ireland]], [[Mary McAleese]].]]
{{morepolitics|country=the Republic of Ireland}}
The state is a [[republic]], with a parliamentary system of government. The [[President of Ireland]], who serves as [[head of state]], is elected for a seven-year term and can be re-elected only once. The president is largely a [[figurehead]] but can still carry out certain [[constitution]]al powers and functions, aided by the [[Council of State]], an advisory body. The {{lang|ga|''[[Taoiseach]]''}} ([[prime minister]]), is appointed by the president on the nomination of parliament. The {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} is normally the leader of the political party which wins the most seats in the national elections. It has become normal in the Republic for [[coalition]]s to form a government, and there has not been a single-party government since the period of 1987&ndash;1989.

The [[bicameral]] [[parliament]], the {{lang|ga|''[[Oireachtas]]''}}, consists of a Senate, {{lang|ga|[[Seanad Éireann]]}}, and a lower house, {{lang|ga|[[Dáil Éireann]]}}. The {{lang|ga|Seanad}} is composed of sixty members; eleven nominated by the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, six elected by two universities, and 43 elected by public representatives from panels of candidates established on a vocational basis. The {{lang|ga|Dáil}} has 166 members, {{lang|ga|''[[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]]''}}, elected to represent multi-seat constituencies under the system of [[proportional representation]] by means of the [[Single Transferable Vote]]. Under the constitution, parliamentary elections must be held at least every seven years, though a lower limit may be set by statute law. The current statutory maximum term is every five years.

[[Image:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Leinster House]], the seat of {{lang|ga|''[[Oireachtas Éireann]]''}} (the Irish parliament).]]
The Government is constitutionally limited to fifteen members. No more than two members of the Government can be selected from the Senate, and the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, {{lang|ga|''[[Tánaiste]]''}} (deputy prime minister) and Minister for Finance ''must'' be members of the {{lang|ga|Dáil}}. The current government consists of a coalition of two parties; {{lang|ga|[[Fianna Fáil]]}} under {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} [[Bertie Ahern]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]] under {{lang|ga|Tánaiste}} [[Michael McDowell]].

The main opposition in the current {{lang|ga|Dáil}} consists of [[Fine Gael]] and [[Irish Labour Party|Labour]]. Smaller parties such as the [[Green Party/Comhaontas Glas|Green Party]], [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Socialist Party of Ireland|Socialist Party]] also have representation in the Dáil.

Ireland joined the [[European Union]] in 1973 but has chosen to remain outside the [[Schengen Treaty]]. Citizens of the UK can freely enter Ireland without a passport thanks to the [[Common Travel Area]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Counties of Ireland}}
The Republic of Ireland traditionally had twenty-six [[County|counties]], and these are still used in cultural and sporting contexts. [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] constituencies are required by statute to follow county boundaries, as far as possible. Hence counties with greater populations have multiple constituencies (e.g. Limerick East/West) and some constituencies consist of more than one county (e.g. Sligo-North Leitrim), but by and large, the actual county boundaries are not crossed. 

As local government units, however, some have been restructured, with the now-abolished [[County Dublin]] distributed between three new county councils in the 1990s and County Tipperary having been administratively two separate counties since the 1890s, giving a present-day total of twenty-nine administrative counties and five cities. The five cities &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway , and Waterford &mdash; are administered separately from the remainder of their respective counties. Five boroughs &mdash; Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford &mdash; have a level of autonomy within the county:

These counties are grouped together into [[Regions of the Republic of Ireland|regions]] for statistical purposes.

==Geography== 
{{main|Geography of Ireland}} 
The island of Ireland extends over 84,421&nbsp;[[Square kilometre|km²]] or 32,556&nbsp;[[Square mile|mi²]], of which 83% (approx. five-sixths) belong to the Republic (70,280&nbsp;km²; 27,103&nbsp;mi²) and the remainder constituting Northern Ireland. It is bound to the west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the northeast by the [[North Channel (Great Britain)|North Channel]]. To the east is found the [[Irish Sea]] which reconnects to the ocean via the southwest with [[St George's Channel]] and the [[Celtic Sea]]. The west-coast of Ireland mostly consists of cliffs, hills and low mountains (the highest point being [[Carrauntoohill|Carrauntoohil]] at 1,041&nbsp;[[Metre|m]] or 3,414&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The interior of the country is relatively flat land, traversed by rivers such as the [[River Shannon]] and several large lakes or ''loughs''. The centre of the country is part of the River Shannon watershed, containing large areas of [[bogland]], used for [[peat]] extraction and production.

The local [[temperate climate]] is modified by the [[North Atlantic Current]] and is relatively mild. Summers are rarely very hot (temperatures only exceed 30º[[Celsius|C]] (86ºF) usually once every decade, though commonly reach 29ºC (84º[[Fahrenheit|F]]) most summers, but it freezes only occasionally in winter (temperatures below -5ºC (23ºF) are very rare). [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is very common, with up to 275 days with rain in some parts of the country. Chief cities are the capital [[Dublin]] on the east coast, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the south, [[Limerick City|Limerick]], [[Galway]] on the west coast, and [[Waterford City|Waterford]] on the south east coast (see [[Cities in Ireland]]).

==Education==
{{seealso|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
The education systems are largely under the direction of the government via the [[Minister for Education and Science (Ireland)|Minister for Education and Science]] (currently Mary Hanafin, TD). Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by authorities that have power to set them.

The education systems in Ireland are complex due to a confusion of ownership, control and curricular assessment. This has arisen because the systems developed over long periods of time with variable influence by several key players, including the Irish state. Unlike in countries such as France, Ireland's state education system is largely limited to the content of the curriculum, although this too is mediated by voluntary interests. 

'''Ownership'''
Technically, the majority of Ireland's primary and secondary schools are owned by the Catholic parishes of the country. Parishes establish schools and this has tended to develop where the local Catholic Church provided the land under the ownership of a Board of Management, composed of various community interests, including but not exclusively so, the local Catholic priest. With the decline in numbers of priests, this has proven more and more problematic. The parish's school is then run by the Board of Management on behalf of the local community. With increasing numbers of non-Catholics in Ireland, the question of Catholic school ethos has become contested. The State provides and pays for the teachers, organises the curriculum and agrees to provide examinations and other centralised services for these schools. At second level, the system of ownership is more complex again because schools owned by the Churches, the State and other voluntary interests happily coexist side by side. At this level, the parish's interests are represented by a Board of Management / Trust established by an order of the Catholic Church under the direction of a Bishop. A state owned secondary school - generally called community or comprehensive schools - is wholly controlled by the State through the Department of Education and Science. A small number of other denominational schools exist such as those organised by the Islamic communities. The church ownership model extends to these groups too. 

'''Control'''
Control of schools is technically vested in the Catholic / Church of Ireland / church grouping. As the State decides the content of educational curricula with various interests, including the Churches, control is effectively in the State's purview. Ireland's educational systems can be characterised in a largely voluntary manner. This does not imply that their effects are politically neutral with class and other interests sequentially embedded throughout each system.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the Republic of Ireland}}
The economy of Ireland has transformed in recent years from an agricultural focus to one dependent on trade, industry and investment. Economic growth in Ireland averaged an exceptional 10% from 1995–2000, and 7% from 2001–2004. [[Industry]], which accounts for 46% of [[Gross Domestic Product|{{abbr|GDP|Gross Domestic Product}}]], about 80% of exports, and 29% of the labour force, now takes the place of [[agriculture]] as the country's leading sector. 

Exports play a fundamental role in the state's robust growth, but the economy also benefits from the accompanying  rise in consumer spending, construction, and business investment. On paper, the country is the largest exporter of software-related goods and services in the world. In fact, a lot of foreign software, and sometimes music, is filtered through the country to avail of the state's non-taxing of royalties from copyrighted goods.

One key reason for the country's economic surge might be the government's role in the past ten years. A number of initiatives to address the problems of high [[inflation]] (with poor results in recent years), large tax burdens, government spending, lack-lustre foreign investment and low job skills have been introduced.

A key part of economic policy, since 1987, has been [[Social Partnership]] which is a [[corporatism|neo-corporatist]] set of voluntary 'pay pacts' between the Government, employers and trades unions. These usually set agreed pay rises for three-year periods.

The state joined in launching the [[euro]] currency system in January 1999 (leaving behind the [[Irish pound]]) along with ten other {{abbr|EU}} nations. The 1995 to 2000 period of high economic growth led many to call the country the [[Celtic Tiger]]. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown in 2001, particularly in the high-tech export sector — the growth rate in that area was cut by nearly half. {{abbr|GDP}} growth continued to be relatively robust, with a rate of about 6% in 2001 and 2002. Growth for 2004 was over 4%, and for 2005 was 4.7%.

With high growth came high levels of inflation, particularly in the capital city. Prices in [[Dublin]], where nearly 30% of Ireland's population lives, are considerably higher than elsewhere in the country {{PDFlink|[http://www.finfacts.com/Private/bestprice/irishconsumerprices.pdf]}}, especially in the [[Irish Property Bubble|booming property market]].

Ireland has the fourth-highest {{abbr|GDP}} (based on [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) per capita in the world after [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]] and the [[United States]], and lies fourth in the [[Human Development Index|2006 UN Human Development Index]], which counts {{abbr|GDP}} per capita as a factor. 

[[The Economist]] Intelligence Unit's Quality of Life Index ({{PDFlink|[http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf]}}) placed Ireland first in its "World in Review 2005" survey.

Poverty figures show that 6.8% of Ireland's population suffer "consistent poverty" {{PDFlink|[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/labour_market/current/eusilc.pdf]}} (2004).

==Military==
{{main|Irish Defence Forces}}
The Republic's armed forces are organised under the [[Irish Defence Forces]] ({{lang|ga|''[[Óglaigh na hÉireann]]''}}). The [[Irish Army]] is relatively small compared to other armies in the region but well equipped, with 8,500 full-time military personnel (13,000 in the reserve army).<ref>[http://www.military.ie/army/intro.htm Irish Defence Forces, Army (accessed 15 June 2006)]</ref> This is principally due to Ireland's nominal designation{{Fact|date=February 2007}} as a [[neutral country]]. Due to the "triple-lock" rules governing participation in conflicts, deployments are on [[United Nations|UN]] peace-keeping duties and protection of the Republic's territorial waters (in the case of the [[Irish Naval Service]]). See [[Irish neutrality]].

There is also an [[Irish Air Corps]] and [[Reserve Defence Forces]] ([[Irish Army Reserve]] and [[Naval Service Reserve]]) under the Defence Forces. The [[Irish Army Rangers]] is a special forces branch which operates under the aegis of the army.

Over 40,000 Irish servicemen have served in UN peacekeeping missions around the world.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland}}
The Irish people are mainly of Gaelic ancestry, and although some of the population is also of English, Scottish (also often Gaelic), French, Anglo-Norman, Viking and Welsh ancestry, these groups have been assimilated and do not form distinct [[minority group]]s. [[Celt]]ic culture and language forms an important part of national identity. The [[Irish Traveller]]s are an ethnic [[minority group]] with links with mainland European Roma and Gypsy groups.

=== Languages ===
The official languages are [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. Teaching of the Irish and English languages is compulsory in the primary and secondary level schools that receive money and recognition from the state. Some students may be exempt from the requirement to receive instruction in either language. [[English language|English]] is by far the predominant language spoken throughout the country. People living in predominantly Irish-speaking communities, (the [[Gaeltacht]]), are limited to the low tens of thousands in isolated pockets largely on the western seaboard. Road signs are usually bilingual, except in the [[Gaeltacht]], where they are in Irish only. The legal status of place names has recently been the subject of controversy, with an order made in 2005 under the [[Official Languages Act 2003|Official Languages Act]] changing the official name of certain locations from English back to Irish (e.g. [[Dingle]] is now officially named ''An Daingean''), sometimes despite local opposition, and, in Dingle's case, a plebiscite requesting a name change to a bilingual version. Most public notices are only in [[English language|English]], as are most of the print media. Most Government publications and forms are available in both English and Irish, and citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish if they so wish.  National media in Irish exist on TV ([[TG4]]), radio (e.g., [[Raidió na Gaeltachta]]), and in print, (e.g. [[Foinse]]).

===Recent population growth===
According to "Marketing Ireland" Ireland has experienced a massive influx in the number of people from the 10 new {{abbr|EU}} accession states. Some 210,000 [[Personal Public Service Number|PPS]] numbers have been issued to people from Poland, Lithuania, Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia. 140,000 PPS numbers have been given to [[Poles in Ireland]]. However, not all those who have received PPS numbers will have remained in Ireland. There are also around 10,000 Americans living in Ireland. There is also a significant Asian, largely Chinese, community in Ireland with an estimated 22,000 people and a Nigerian population of around 9,000 in 2002 [http://www.cso.ie/statistics/persclassbynationality2002.htm]. Certain areas, such as the town of Gort in County Galway, have also seen an influx of [[Brazil]]ians.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It is estimated that 10,000 Poles alone arrive in Ireland to work every month. In 2006, over 200,000 immigrants arrived to work in Ireland.&nbsp;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/?jp=CWSNKFOJOJOJ]

The [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|CSO]] published preliminary findings based on the 2006 Census of Population on [[July 19]] [[2006]]. These indicate:
* The total population of Ireland on Census Day, [[April 23]] [[2006]], was 4,234,925, an increase of 317,722, or 8.1% since [[2002]]
*Allowing for the incidence of births (245,000) and deaths (114,000), the derived net immigration of people to Ireland between 2002 and 2006 was 186,000. It is estimated that the cohort of non-nationals resident in Ireland is of the order of 400,000 — a number that will be clarified in [[April]] [[2007]].
*The average annual rate of increase, 2%, is the highest on record – compared to 1.3% between 1996 and 2002 and 1.5% between 1971 and 1979.
*The 2006 population was last exceeded in the 1861 Census when the population then was 4.4 million The lowest population of Ireland was recorded in the 1961 Census – 2.6 million.
*All provinces of Ireland recorded population growth. The population of [[Leinster]] grew by 8.9%; [[Munster]] by 6.5%; and the long-term population decline of the [[Connacht]]-[[Ulster]]<ref>Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan only.  Remaining Ulster counties are in Northern Ireland</ref> Region has stopped.
* The ratio of males to females has declined in each of the four provinces between 1979 and 2006. Leinster is the only province where the number of females exceeds the number of males. Males predominate in rural counties such as [[Cavan]], [[Leitrim]], and [[Roscommon]] while the are more females in cities and urban areas.

Detailed statistics into the population of Ireland since [[1841]] are available at [[Irish Population Analysis]].

==Religion==
[[Image:Bohermeenoldchurch.JPG|thumb|A Roman Catholic Mass in Ireland, [[circa]] 1950. The population of Ireland is still predominantly Roman Catholic.]]
[[Image:Stpatrickcathedral dublin.jpg|thumb|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, the National Cathedral of the [[Church of Ireland]] (part of the [[Anglican Communion]]).]]
The Republic of Ireland is 88% nominally [[Roman Catholic]], and has one of the highest rates of regular and weekly church attendance in the [[Western World]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} However, there has been a major decline in this attendance among [[Irish Catholic]]s since the liturgical, disciplinary and theological reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]] were implemented. Larger structural changes in the Irish economy can also account for this decline. Between 1996 and 2001, regular [[Roman Catholic Mass|Mass]] attendance, declined further from 60% to 48% (it had been above 90% before 1973), and all but two of its sacerdotal seminaries have closed (St Patrick's College Maynooth and St Malachy's College, Belfast). A number of theological colleges continue to educate both ordained and lay people. 

The second largest Christian denomination, the [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), having been declining in number for most of the twentieth century, but has more recently experienced an increase in membership, according to the 2002 census, as have other small Christian denominations, and [[Islam]]. The largest other Protestant denominations are the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], followed by the [[Methodist Church in Ireland]]. The very small [[Judaism|Jewish]] community in the state also recorded a marginal increase (see [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]) in the same period.

===Religion and politics===
The [[1937]] [[Constitution of Ireland]] gave the Roman Catholic Church a "special position" as the church of the majority, but also recognised other Christian denominations and Judaism.  As with other predominantly Roman Catholic European states (e.g., [[Italy]]), the Irish state underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late [[20th century|twentieth century]].  In [[1972]], the articles mentioning specific religious groups, including the Catholic Church were deleted from the Irish constitution by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]].

Article 44 remains in the Constitution. It begins:
:''The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.''
The article also establishes freedom of religion (for belief, practice, and organisation without undue interference from the state), prohibits endowment of any particular religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.

Catholic doctrine prohibits [[abortion]] in all circumstances, putting it in conflict with the [[pro-choice]] movement.  In [[1983]], the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] recognised "the right to life of the unborn", subject to qualifications concerning the "equal right to life" of the mother.  The case of ''[[Attorney General v. X]]'' prompted passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fourteenth]] Amendments, guaranteeing the right to travel abroad to have an abortion performed, and the right of citizens to learn about "services" that are illegal in Ireland but legal outside the country (see [[Abortion in Ireland]]).

Catholic and Protestant attitudes in 1937 also disfavoured [[divorce]], which was prohibited by the original Constitution.  It was not until [[1995]] that the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fifteenth Amendment]] repealed this ban.

The Catholic Church was hit in the 1990s by a series of sexual abuse scandals and cover-up charges against its hierarchy. In 2005, a major inquiry was made into [[child sexual abuse]] allegations. The Ferns report, published on [[25 October]], [[2005]], revealed that more than 100 cases of child sexual abuse, between 1962 and 2002, by 21 priests, had taken place in the Diocese of Ferns alone. The report criticised the [[Garda]] and the health authorities, who failed to protect the children to the best of their abilities; and in the case of the Garda before 1988, no file was ever recorded on sexual abuse complaints (see [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases]]).

Despite most schools in Ireland being run by religious organisations, a general trend of secularism is occurring within the Irish population, particularly in the younger generations. Many efforts have been made by concerned educational groups, to eliminate the rigorous study of prayer in the 1st and 6th classes, to prepare for the sacrements of holy communion and confirmation. However religious studies as a subject was introduced into the state administered "Junior certificate" in 2001.

==Culture==

In [[European classical music|classical music]], the Island of Ireland was also the birthplace of the notable composers [[Turlough O'Carolan]], [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] (inventor of the [[Nocturne]]), [[Gerald Barry]], [[Michael William Balfe]], Sir [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] and [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]].

Successful entertainment exports in the late twentieth century include acts such as [[Horslips]], [[U2]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Boomtown Rats]], [[The Pogues]], [[The Corrs]], [[Clannad]], [[Boyzone]], [[Ronan Keating]], [[The Cranberries]], [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]], [[Westlife]] and [[Enya]], and the internationally acclaimed dance shows ''[[Riverdance]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Dance]]''. In the early twenty-first century, [[Damien Rice]] and [[The Thrills]] rose to international fame, followed swiftly by [[Snow Patrol]]. [[The Frames]] are a popular band in Ireland who are on the rise world-wide, although their status as possibly the most well-liked live band in Ireland is under threat from newer bands like [[Bell X1]]. [[The Blizzards]] are a [[ska]]-[[pop]] band from Mullingar, who gained a sudden surge of popularity following their 2006 album release.

Notable Hollywood actors from the Republic of Ireland include [[Maureen O'Hara]], [[Barry Fitzgerald]], [[Maureen O'Sullivan]], [[Richard Harris]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Daniel Day Lewis]] (by citizenship), [[Colm Meaney]], [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Cillian Murphy]].

Ireland has produced a number of talented sportsmen and women. In soccer, former players include [[Roy Keane]], [[Johnny Giles]], [[Liam Brady]], [[Denis Irwin]], [[Packie Bonner]], [[Niall Quinn]] and [[Paul McGrath]], while footballers whose careers are ongoing include [[Shay Given]] and [[Robbie Keane]]. In rugby Ireland has produced [[Ronan O'Gara]] and [[Brian O'Driscoll]] while in athletics [[Sonia O'Sullivan]] and [[Derval O'Rourke]] have had success in international events. Notable [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] players include the now retired pair of [[DJ Carey]] and [[Peter Canavan]]. A famous bareknuckled boxer although he was not born in Ireland, [[John L. Sullivan]], born 1858 from Irish immigrants was and is historically the first modern world heavyweight champion. [[Barry McGuigan]] was also a world champion boxer, while Bernard Dunne is a current European champion and is expecting a crack at a world title later in 2007.

[[Robert Boyle]] was a 17th century physicist and discovered [[Boyle's Law]]. [[Ernest Walton]] of [[Trinity College Dublin]] shared the [[1951]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for "splitting the atom". [[William Rowan Hamilton]] was a significant mathematician.
