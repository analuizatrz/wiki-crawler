Colonel '''David "Dave" Devall''' is a well-known meteorologist who presents the weather on [[CTV News]] for television station [[CTV]] in [[Toronto, Ontario, Canada]] having been an employee since 1961.

Dave was born, raised, and educated in Toronto, Ontario. While studying Radio and Television Arts at Ryerson, he also served in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) where part of his training centered on meteorology. In 1956, while still a student, he worked at CFPL-TV and then moved to CFRB where he stayed from 1957-1958. After graduating in 1958, he worked at CHEX-TV in Peterborough, Ontario. When CTV Toronto launched in 1961, Devall auditioned with 2,000 other hopefuls; he was one of six people hired as a broadcaster. 

Devall is best known in Canada as [[Jim Perry (television)|Jim Perry]]'s announcer on many of his game shows, including ''[[Definition (TV series)|Definition]]'', ''[[Headline Hunters]]'' and ''[[Eye Bet]]''.

A member of the World Meteorological Organization, Dave hones his forecasting skills by regularly attending weather conferences throughout North America. He is always working to further his understanding and knowledge of meteorology and climatology in areas such as severe storm forecasting, ozone studies, UV interpretation and air, land, and sea pollution.

Despite various new weathercasters, Devall remains the senior and top weatherman at the station, and also appears daily on [[CTV Newsnet]]. His funny antics have made him popular with Toronto viewers. During his early years, he would stand behind a clear [[acrylic glass]] weather map, which necessitated writing backwards with a marker. He continues the tradition today with a single daily weather word (since the weather maps are now generated electronically.)
