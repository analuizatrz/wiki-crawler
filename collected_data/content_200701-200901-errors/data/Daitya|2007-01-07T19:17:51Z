In [[Hinduism]], the '''Daityas''' (दैत्‍य) were the children of [[Diti]] and the sage [[Kashyapa]]. They were a race of [[giant (mythology)|giants]] who fought against the [[god]]s because they were jealous of their [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] half-brothers. Some known Daityas include [[Bali (Daitya)|Bali]], [[Hiranyakashipu]] and [[Hiranyaksha]]. They are also called [[Asuras]], but that name is also used for the [[Danavas]].

According to Helena P. [[Blavatsky]], Daitya is also the name of an island-continent during the Atlantean times which perished 850,000 years ago. It was said to have been inhabited by giant human beings. Reference: [[The Secret Doctrine]]
