The '''monarchy of Canada''', also known as the '''Canadian monarchy'''<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/index_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: The Canadian Monarchy]</ref><ref name="Buck1" /> is a system of government in which a hereditary [[monarch]] is the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] of [[Canada]], holding the position of [[head of state]]; the incumbent is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], officially called [[Style of the Canadian Sovereign|Queen of Canada]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Reine du Canada''), who has [[Queen regnant|reigned]] since [[February 6]], [[1952]]. The [[heir apparent]] is Elizabeth's eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], though the Queen is presently the only member of the [[#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]] with any [[Constitution of Canada|constitutional]] role. She, her husband and [[List of Canadian monarchs#List of Royal Consorts of Canada|consort]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], Prince Charles, and other members of the Royal Family, including the Queen's other children and cousins, undertake various public ceremonial functions across Canada and on behalf of Canada abroad.

Most of the Queen's powers in Canada are exercised by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], presently [[Michaëlle Jean]], though the monarch does hold several powers that are hers alone. The Governor General, who maintains direct contact with the monarch,<ref name="Buck2" /> is sometimes referred to as Canada's [[de facto head of state|''de facto'' head of state]].<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/governor_general/role_e.asp Governor General: Role]</ref>

The Canadian monarch, besides reigning in Canada, separately serves as [[head of state]] for each of fifteen other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.  This developed from the former colonial relationship of these countries to Britain, but they are now independent and the monarchy of each is legally distinct.

The Canadian Crown is sometimes colloquially dubbed "the Maple Crown,"<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/discours-speeches/2007/kenney/2007-04-23_e.cfm The Honourable Jason Kenney; Talking Points for The Honourable Jason Kenney, Secretary of State (Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity); Lieutenant Governors Meeting; Regina, Saskatchewan; April 23, 2007]</ref> a term first coined by Governor General [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] in 1905, when he stated about his inauguration of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in a [[telegram]] to King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] "[each one] a new leaf in Your Majesty's Maple Crown."<ref>Grey Papers; Grey to Edward VII; 4 March and 1 Sept. 1905</ref>

==Origins==
[[Image:Queen of canada wob.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] wearing the [[Monarch|Sovereign]]'s insignia of the [[Order of Canada]] and the [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|Order of Military Merit]].]]
The current Canadian [[monarchy]] can trace its ancestral lineage back to the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period, and ultimately back to the [[List of kings of the Angles|kings of the Angles]] and the early [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish kings]]. Parts of the territories that today comprise Canada were claimed under King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1534, while others were claimed by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1583; both of whom are [[blood relative]]s of the current monarch. Throughout the [[18th century]], via war and treaties, the [[New France|Canadian colonies of France]] were ceded to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].  The [[Canadian Confederation|colonies were confederated]] by Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in 1867 to form [[Canada]] as a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] in its own right,<ref name="Heritage">{{PDFlink|[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf The Crown in Canada]|376&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 385993 bytes -->}}</ref> and the country was proclaimed fully independent, via [[Constitution Act, 1982|constitutional patriation]], by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 1982.

==International and domestic aspects==
Sixteen states within the 53-member [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are in a [[personal union]] relationship and are known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s;<ref>Zines, ''The High Court and the Constitution'', 4th ed. (1997) at 314: "The Queen as monarch of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand is in a position resembling that of the King of Scotland and of England between 1603 and 1707 when two independent countries had a common sovereign"; the relationship between England and Scotland during those years is described as a [[personal union]].</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = The Status of the British Commonwealth in International Law|author = P.

===Development of shared monarchy===
The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] provided the [[Dominion]]s the right to be considered equal to Britain, rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of a shared Crown that operates independently in each realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the [[Dominion]]s were secondary. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called "British" since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, political, and of convenience. The [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]] was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]].

Though constitutional laws governing the line of succession to the Canadian throne lie within the control of the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]],<ref name="Topo">[http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm Toporoski, Richard; ''Monarchy Canada'': The Invisible Crown; Summer, 1998]</ref> via adopting the Statute of Westminster Canada agreed not to change its rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship. This situation applies [[Symmetry|symmetrically]] in all the other realms, including the United Kingdom, a situation that has been likened to a [[treaty]] amongst these countries.<ref>Justice Rouleau in a 2003 [[O'Donohue v. Canada|court ruling]] wrote that "Union under the... Crown together with other Commonwealth countries [is a] constitutional principle." [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O’Donohue v. Canada, 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.)]</ref>  Besides the two countries having symmetrical Acts of Settlement, there is no provision in Canadian law that states the King or Queen of Canada must be the same person as the King or Queen of the United Kingdom; thus, if the United Kingdom were to breach the convention set out in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster and change the line of succession to the British throne without Canada's consent, the alteraton would have no effect on the reigning sovereign of Canada or his or her heirs and successors.<ref name="Topo" />

On all matters of the Canadian state, the monarch is advised solely by Canadian federal and provincial [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]].<ref name="Buck1">[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4918.asp Buckingham Palace: The Queen and Commonwealth: Canada]</ref> Effective with the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], no British or other realm government can advise the monarch on any matters pertinent to Canada.<ref>In 1997, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] intended to offer a [[Life Peer]]age to Canadian businessman [[Conrad Black]]. Citing the 1919 [[Nickle Resolution]], the Canadian government advised the Queen that they have objected to such honours for many years. If Blair had not backed down, the Queen would have been in the situation of having to grant an [[honour]] on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and to object to the same as Queen of Canada on the advice of then Prime Minister of Canada [[Jean Chrétien]]. The problem was resolved when Black renounced his Canadian citizenship. Canada raised no further objections and he was granted his peerage, becoming Lord Black of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Crossharbour]].</ref>
{{See|Queen's Privy Council for Canada}}

===Title===
{{Main|Style of the Canadian Sovereign}}
In Canada, the Queen's official title is:
* In [[English language|English]]: ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]].''
* In [[French language|French]]: ''{{lang|fr|Elizabeth Deux, par la grâce de Dieu, Reine du Royaume-Uni, du Canada et de ses autres royaumes et territoires, Chef du Commonwealth, Défenseur de la Foi}}.''

This style communicates Canada's status as an independent monarchy, highlighting the sovereign's role specifically as Queen of Canada, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the realms, by mentioning Canada separately from the other countries. Typically, the sovereign is styled "Queen of Canada," and is addressed as such when in Canada, or performing duties on behalf of Canada abroad.

Although the Queen's Canadian titles include "[[Defender of the Faith]]/''{{lang|fr|Défenseur de la Foi}}''," neither the Queen nor any of her governors has any religious role in Canada; there have been no [[established church]]es in Canada since before [[Canadian Confederation|confederation]].
{{See|List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II}}

===Finance===
Contrary to common misconception, Canadians do not pay any money to the Queen, either for personal income or to support the royal residences outside of Canada. Only when the Queen is in Canada, or acting abroad as Queen of Canada, does she draw from Canadian coffers for support in the performance of her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the [[Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]].<ref name="CCC">[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: $1.10 per Canadian'']</ref>  Usually the Queen's Canadian governments pay only for the costs associated with the Governor General and Lieutenant Governors in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonial occasions, etc.<ref name="CCC" />

Provincial and federal records of expenditures associated with the Crown are kept, but no official report on the cost of the monarchy to Canadians is compiled. However, every three years the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] issues a survey, based on various federal and provincial government budgets, expenditures and estimates, that outlines a yearly cost for the functioning of the Crown. The 2005 survey found that the institution cost Canadians roughly $49 million in 2004.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/Report.pdf ''$1.53 per Canadian: The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy, 2005'']|906&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 927868 bytes -->}}</ref>

Previous surveys found that the overall cost of the Canadian Crown was $22 million in 1999,<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costs.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: 74 Cents per Canadian'']</ref> and $34 million in 2002.<ref name="CCC" /><ref>[http://members.tripod.com/~constantian/expense2.html The Constantian Society. The [[Constantian Society]]'s detailed comparison of the costs of monarchies versus [[republic]]s.]</ref> (This does not take into account the inflation of the [[Canadian Dollar]] over these years.)

===Succession===
[[Image:Charles, Prince of Wales.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]], is the [[heir apparent]] to the Canadian Throne]]

The [[heir apparent]] is Elizabeth II's eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]].<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/english.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Prince of Wales Royal Visit]</ref>  Upon the [[demise of the Crown]] the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] is expected to proclaim him [[Style of the Canadian Sovereign|King of Canada]] upon his accession to the throne.

Succession to the throne is by [[primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]], and governed by the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement, 1701]], as well as the [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights]]; these documents, though originally passed by the [[Parliament of England]], are now part of Canadian constitutional law, under control of the Canadian parliament only. As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment.  This legislation restricts the succession to the natural (i.e. non-[[adoption|adopted]]), legitimate descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]] (1630–1714), a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James I]], and lays out the rules that the monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]], nor married to one, and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne, a provision that has led to [[O'Donohue v. Canada|a legal challenge]].  As Canada's laws governing succession are currently identical to those of the United Kingdom (by the Statute of Westminster), see [[Succession to the British Throne]] for more information.

Upon a "demise in the Crown" (the death of a sovereign), his or her heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony; hence arises the phrase "[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]" Nevertheless, it is customary for the accession of the sovereign to be publicly proclaimed by the Queen's Privy Council, which meets at [[Rideau Hall]]. After an appropriate period of mourning has passed, the sovereign is also [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], normally by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short reign.

After an individual ascends the throne, he or she continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; the only Canadian monarch to abdicate, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], did so with the authorization of a special [[Act of Parliament|Act of the Canadian Parliament]]: the [[Succession to the Throne Act]].

==Constitutional role==
[[Image:EIIR-Canadian Parliament.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] reads the [[Throne Speech]] in a joint session of the [[Canadian Parliament]], 1977, accompanied by her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].]]

[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Canadian in origin, which gives Canada a similar parliamentary system of government to the other Commonwealth realms.  All powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the monarch,<ref>[http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/docs/InformationResources/Publications/guidemin/accountable-guide2007_e.pdf ''Accountable Government: A Guide for Ministers and Secretaries of State; Library and Archives Cataloguing in Publication; 2007; p. 49]</ref> who is represented at the federal level by the [[Governor General of Canada]] &ndash; appointed by the monarch upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] &ndash; and at the provincial level by [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]]s &ndash; appointed by the Governor General upon the advice of the Prime Minister, usually in consultation with the relevant provincial premier;<ref name="McCullough">[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/lg.htm McCullough, John; ''Interview with Lieutenant Governor Iona Campagnolo''; April 23, 2004]</ref> the monarch is informed of the Prime Minister's decision before the Governor General gives [[Royal Assent]].<ref> [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/index-e.asp Forsey, Eugene; ''How Canadians Govern Themselves''; Parliament of Canada]</ref> Most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by these [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] representatives.

As all executive authority is vested in the sovereign, the institutions of government are said to act under her authority; hence, the government of Canada is formally referred to as "Her Majesty's Government in Canada,"<ref name="US">[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=4363 Documents on Canadian External Relations: Chapter VIII: Relations with the United States; Part III]</ref> however, since the early 1970s, though the constitutional arrangements have not changed, the government is more often addressed simply as "The [[Government of Canada]]."  As such, the constitution instructs that any change to the position of the monarch, or the monarch's representatives in Canada, requires the consent of the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]], the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces.

===Constitutional duties===
The role of the Queen and the Governor General is both legal and practical; the Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the Queen as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct.<ref name="Murdoch" />

The vast powers that belong to the Crown, collectively known as the [[Royal Prerogative]], include many powers, such as the ability to make treaties and send [[ambassador]]s and include certain duties, such as defense the realm and to maintenance of the [[Queen's peace]]. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the consent of the Crown must be obtained before either of the Houses of Parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests.  It is important to note that the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, and not to any of the ministers, though it may sometimes appear that way.<ref name="Murdoch" /> Although the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited. For example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorization of an [[Act of Parliament]].

The Crown appoints a prime minister, who advises the monarch and Governor General on how to execute their executive powers. In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the monarch or Governor General must appoint the individual most likely to maintain the support of the House of Commons: usually, the leader of the party with a majority in that house. In a parliament in which no party or coalition holds a majority, the Crown is required, by convention, to appoint the individual most likely to command the support of the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]], usually, but not necessarily, the leader of the largest party. Thus, for example, [[Paul Martin]] remained Prime Minister for over a year after the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]], even though his party did not command a majority in the commons. Situations can arise in which the Governor General's judgement about the most suitable leader to be Prime Minister has to be brought into play.<ref name="GG">[http://www.gg.ca/media/fs-fd/P1_e.asp Governor General of Canada: The Swearing in of a new Ministry]</ref>  The Queen is informed by the Governor General of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister and members of the ministry.<ref name="GG" />
{{rquote|right|''The Crown is an integral part of a practical form of government, and as such it has a direct and substantive part to play in the lives of all Canadians.''<ref>Smith, David E.; ''The Invisible Crown''; University of Toronto Press; 1995; p. 26</ref>|David E. Smith, ''The Invisible Crown'', 1995}}

It is a duty of the Crown to also appoint and dismiss ministers, members of various executive agencies, and other officials. The appointment of [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governors]], [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Councillors]], [[Canadian Senate|Senators]], the Speaker of the Senate, [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] justices, and [[Superior court|Superior]] and County Court judges in each province, also falls under the Royal Prerogative, though these duties are specifically assigned to the Governor General by the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], save for the appointment of judges to the Courts of Probate in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]. Effectively, however, the appointees are chosen by the Prime Minister, or, for less important offices, by other ministers.  The lieutenant governors are also specifically delegated to appoint under the Great Seal of the Province, the Attorney General, the Secretary and Registrar of the Province, the Treasurer of the Province, the Commissioner of [[Crown land|Crown Lands]], and the Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works, and in the Case of Quebec the Solicitor General.

In addition, it is the Crown's prerogative to declare war, make peace, and direct the actions of the military, although the Prime Minister holds ''de facto'' decision-making power over the armed forces.  The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the sovereign or Governor General may negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements; no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of Canada; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Governor General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Canadian [[High Commissioner]]s and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, all Canadian [[passport]]s are issued in the monarch's name. In Canada, major [[public inquiries]] are called [[Royal Commission]]s, and are created by the [[Cabinet]], on behalf of the monarch, through a [[Royal Warrant]].

[[Image:033278.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], [[Style of the Canadian Sovereign|King of Canada]], and his consort, [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]], occupy the thrones in the Canadian Senate, while the King grants [[Royal Assent]] to laws, [[May 19]], [[1939]].]]
The sovereign is one of the three components of [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]]; the others are the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The [[Constitution Act, 1867]], also outlines that the Governor General alone is responsible for summoning the House of Commons, though it remains the monarch's prerogative to [[prorogation|prorogue]], and [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolve]] parliament. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which either the monarch or the Governor General reads the [[Speech from the Throne]] in the Senate Chamber, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. A general election follows dissolution, the [[Writ of election|writs for which]] are [[Dropping the writ|dropped by the Governor General]] at [[Rideau Hall]].

There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the Queen. These include signing the appointment papers of Governors General, the confirmation of awards of [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Canada|Canadian honours]], and the approval of any change in her Canadian title.<ref>[http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=562&FT=yes Speech by Governor General Roland Michener, Nov. 19, 1970]</ref> On occasion the monarch must personally act directly in [[partisan (political)|partisan]] affairs. For example, this occurred when Queen Elizabeth II expanded the number of Senate seats to assure passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|GST]].

In the last example, the Queen performed this task on the advice of Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]], illustrating that because the Canadian monarchy is a constitutional one, the powers that are constitutionally the monarch's are exercised almost wholly upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] and the [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] in [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], who are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Commons, and through it, to the people. It has been said since the death of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714, the last monarch to head the British cabinet (when almost all of Canada was still French colonial territory), that the monarch "reigns" but does not "rule". In Canada, this has been true since the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ended the reign of Canada's last absolute monarch, King [[Louis XV of France]].  This means that the monarch's role, and thereby the Vice-regent's role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate.  The Queen is fully briefed through regular communications from her Canadian ministers, and holds audience with them where possible.<ref name="Buck2"/>

In exceptional circumstances, however, the monarch or vice-regal representative can act against such advice based upon his or her [[reserve power]]s<ref name="Murdoch">[http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html Cox, Noel; ''Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law'': Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence; Volume 9, Number 3 (September 2002)]</ref> &ndash; as when Governor General [[Baron Byng|Julian Byng]] refused a request by Prime Minister [[W.L. Mackenzie King|William Mackenzie King]] for a dissolution of Parliament and call for new elections, resulting in the [[King-Byng Affair]]. Also, [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta]], [[John C. Bowen]], in 1937 refused to grant Royal Assent to three bills passed by [[William Aberhart]]'s [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] government on the [[William Aberhart#Political career|grounds that they were unconstitutional]],<ref>[http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pub/gdbook/Part1/page2.htm The Citizen's Guide to the Alberta Legislature Part I: The Foundation]</ref> and [[Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan]] [[Frank Lindsay Bastedo]] reserved Royal Assent to a bill in [[1961]], passing it on, instead, to the Governor General for consideration.<ref>[http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/bastedo_frank_lindsay_1886-1973.html "Frank Lindsay Bastedo", ''Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan'']</ref>

===Provinces===
{{Main|Monarchy in the Canadian provinces}}
[[Image:May23 14-QE-Alb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The three main bodies of the [[Government of Alberta|provincial government of Alberta]]: The [[Queen of Canada]] (centre) with her vice-regal representative, the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta]], [[Norman Kwong]] (left), and her [[Premier of Alberta|Albertan premier]], [[Ralph Klein]] (right), at the official celebrations of [[Alberta]]'s centennary, [[May 23]], [[2005]].]]

Across the country the Crown is unitary. Under this system the [[Head of State|headship of state]] is not a part of either the federal or provincial jurisdictions; the Queen reigns impartially over the country as a whole; meaning the [[sovereignty]] of the provinces is passed on not by the Governor General or the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]], but through the Crown itself.  This means that, though unitary, the Crown is "divided" into eleven legal jurisdictions; into eleven "crowns" &ndash; one federal and ten provincial.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/CMN_winter_spring_2003_Update-3.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003]</ref>  The [[:Category:Fathers of Confederation|Fathers of Confederation]] viewed this system of constitutional monarchy as a bulkwark against any potential fracturing of the [[Canadian confederation|Canadian federation]].<ref>Smith; p. 8</ref>

A [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] serves as the Queen's representative in each province, carrying out all the monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties of state on her behalf.  The [[Commissioner]]s of Canada's territories of [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon]], and [[Northwest Territories]] are appointed by the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]], at the recommendation of the federal [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]]. But as the territories are not sovereign entities, the commissioners are ''not'' representatives of the sovereign. They receive instruction from the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

==Legal role==
All laws in Canada are enacted with the sovereign's, or the viceroy's signature, though there is some debate{{Who|date=July 2007}} over whether the monarch is constitutionally allowed to personally grant Royal Assent to provincial bills.  Thus, all federal bills begin with the phrase "Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows."<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=2604319&file=4 Bill C43: ''An Act to provide for consultations with electors on their preferences for appointments to the Senate'']</ref>  The granting of a signature to a bill is known as [[Royal Assent]]; it, and proclamation, are required for all acts of parliament and of the provincial legislatures, usually granted or withheld by the Governor General or Lieutenant Governor, with the [[Great Seal of Canada]], or the appropriate provincial seal. The Governor General may reserve a bill for the monarch's pleasure, that is to say, allow the monarch to make a personal decision on the bill. A Lieutenant Governor of a province may similarly defer to the Governor General (who may in turn defer to the monarch). The monarch has the power to disallow any bill, within a time limit specified by the Constitution. Recently activists opposed to [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Bill C-38]] lobbied Queen Elizabeth II to disallow the legislation after it was passed by parliament. However it received Royal Assent from The Right Honourable [[Beverley McLachlin]], Deputy of the Governor General, on [[July 20]], [[2005]]. Territorial legislatures, unlike their provincial counterparts, are subject to the oversight of the Government of Canada.<ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-27/252179.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Northwest Territories Act''; 1985]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Y-2.01/265655.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Yukon Act''; 2000]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-28.6/index.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Nunavut Act''; 1993]</ref>

[[Image:Canadian Supreme Court justices circa 1950.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is displayed the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]].]]
The sovereign is deemed the "fount of justice," and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects; however, he or she does not personally rule in judicial cases. Instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name.  Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences.  Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognizable. In international cases, as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and under established principles of [[international law]], the Queen of Canada is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent.<ref name="US" /> The sovereign, and by extension the Governor General, also exercises the "prerogative of mercy," and may pardon offences against the Crown. Pardons may be awarded before, during, or after a trial.

In addition, the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of courts of justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada]] is always displayed in Canadian courtrooms; exceptions are the courts of [[British Columbia]], the [[Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador]], and some of the courts of Ontario, where the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the United Kingdom]] are displayed as a symbol of the judiciary.<ref>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Courts of British Columbia]</ref><ref>http://www.court.nl.ca/supreme/default.htm</ref>  [[Itinerant]] judges will display an image of the Queen and the Canadian flag when holding a session away from established courtrooms; such situations occur in parts of Canada where the stakeholders in a given court case are too isolated geographically to be able to travel for regular proceedings.

In Canada the legal personality of the [[state]] is referred to as "Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada" (French: ''Sa Majesté la Reine du chef du Canada''), and likewise for the provinces and territories (i.e., "in Right of Ontario," etc.).<ref>[http://arizonaenergy.org/images/ontario_mou_e.pdf ''Memorandum for Understanding of Cooperation on Addressing Climate Change''; May 21, 2004]</ref> For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the federal government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Likewise, in a case in which a party sues both the province of [[Saskatchewan]] and the federal government, the respondents would formally be called "Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Saskatchewan" and "Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada."<ref>[http://www.usask.ca/nativelaw/factums/claim.html Lac La Ronge Indian Band vs. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN In Right of Canada, and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN in Right of the Province of Saskatchewan; Q.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found in the 1980 case Attorney General of Quebec v. Labrecque that [[Civil service|civil servants]] in Canada are not contracted by an abstraction called "the [[state]]," but rather they are employed by the monarch, who personifies the state (see below) and "enjoys a general capacity to contract in accordance with the rule of ordinary law."<ref>Smith; p. 79</ref>  This situation is similar for the governors, judges, members of the [[Canadian Forces]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentarians]], who all technically work for the monarch.  Hence, these people are required by law to recite the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]], which is to the Canadian sovereign, before taking their posts.  However, the 2003 Public Services Modernization Act ended the requirement of civil servants to swear allegiance to the Queen. Also, by the [[Canadian nationality law|Citizenship Act]], new [[citizenship|citizens]] also must swear allegiance to the monarch in the [[Oath of citizenship (Canada)|Oath of Citizenship]], in [[Reciprocal|reciprocation]] to the sovereign's [[Coronation]] Oath, wherein he or she promises "to govern the Peoples of... Canada... according to their respective laws and customs."<ref>[http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June, 1953]</ref>

===Embodiment of the State===

At one time the monarchy was considered a purely British institution, both culturally and legally, when most Canadians still continued to be, both by law and by personal view, [[British subject]]s. However, paralleling the changes in constitutional law, and the evolution of [[Canadian nationalism]], the cultural role of the monarchy in Canada altered.

Since the late 1980s, the federal and provincial governments have recognized and promoted the Queen's role as monarch of Canada as separate to her position as monarch of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate//Monarchy/SenMonarchy_15-e.htm Canada: a Constitutional Monarchy]</ref><ref>[http://canada.gc.ca/howgoc/queen/quind_e.html Biography: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/protocol/Practice/crown_in_canada.htm Saskatchewan Government Relations: The Crown in Canada]</ref>  Today the sovereign is regarded as the personification of the Canadian [[state]], and is described by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] as the "personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians."<ref name="Heritage" /><ref name="Buck2">[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5179.asp Buckingham Palace: The Queen and Commonwealth: Canada: The Queen's role in Canada]</ref> Elizabeth II stated in 1973:
:"But it is as Queen of Canada that I am here, Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains. I want the Crown to be seen as a symbol of national sovereignty belonging to all. It is not only a link between Commonwealth nations, but between Canadian citizens of every national origin and ancestry."

From time to time the sovereign or another member of the Royal Family will represent Canada abroad.  On these occasions they are acting as monarch of Canada and members of the [[Monarchy in Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]], and will regularly carry out two types of duties: official duties involve the sovereign representing the [[state]] at home or abroad, or other members representing the sovereign in Canada or elsewhere. For example, the Queen, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] have participated in Canadian ceremonies for the anniversary of [[D-Day]] in [[France]].<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/timeline_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: Timeline: The Queen]</ref> Presently, the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] is responsible for organizing events wherein members of the Royal Family represent Canada.<ref>[http://www.canadapost.ca/personal/collecting/default-e.asp?stamp=stpartl&detail=1350 Canada Post; Canada's Stamp Details: ''Queen Elizabeth: 1926-2006''; Vol. XV No 1; January to March 2006]</ref> Unofficial duties are performed by Royal Family members on behalf of Canadian organizations of which they may be [[Patronage|patrons]], through their attendance at charity events, visiting with members of the [[Canadian Forces]] as [[Colonel-in-Chief]], or marking certain key anniversaries. The invitation and expenses associated with these undertakings are usually borne by the associated organization. In 2002 members of the Royal Family were present at a total of 117 Canadian engagements, 57 events in 2003, 19 in 2004, and 76 in 2005.

Apart from Canada, the Queen and other members of the Royal Family regularly perform public duties in the other fifteen nations of the Commonwealth in which the Queen is head of state (see, for example, [[List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II]]). As the Crown within these countries is a legally separate entity from the Canadian Crown, it is funded in these countries individually, through the ordinary legislative budgeting process.

{{Main|Canadian royal symbols}}

Monarchical symbols in Canada were originally identical to those in the United Kingdom, having been imported from there to all parts of the [[British Empire|Empire]].  As the country incrementally gained independence from the UK, more and more distinctly Canadian elements were added to certain symbols associated with the Crown.  Into the 1970s and 1980s, some royally connected icons were removed or replaced as [[National symbols of Canada|national symbols]], such as the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Red Ensign]], which contained the [[Union Flag|Royal Union Flag]] in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|canton]], being replaced with the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf flag]]. The Crown remains a visible part of the everyday lives of Canadians, with symbols specifially of the monarch of Canada, or loyalty thereto.

The monarchy is presently symbolized through images of the sovereign on [[Canadian dollar|currency]] and in portraits in public buildings; in songs, toasts and salutes;<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 404]</ref><ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 449-450]</ref> on [[Canadian honours system|decorations and honours]]; and on provincial and [[Coat of Arms of Canada|national coats of arms]].  Certain key days are also reserved to celebrate the monarchy, notably [[Victoria Day]] &ndash; the holiday for celebrating the reigning sovereign's birthday <ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/jfa-ha/victoria_e.cfm Heritage Canada: Victoria Day]</ref> &ndash; and the day of the [[Royal Christmas Message]], broadcast to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since 1932.

There are also hundreds of places named for Canadian monarchs and members of the Royal Family all across Canada.  No individual has been more honoured than Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in the names of Canada's public buildings, streets, populated places and physical features.<ref>[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008358 ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'':Victoria]</ref>

===Royal presence===
{{Main|Royal tours of Canada}}
Members of the Royal Family have been present in Canada since the late [[1700s]], either on military maneuvers, for official tours, the vice-regal representative of the British, and later Canadian monarch. Though all of the Royal Family currently lives outside of the country, members are still regular visitors, enough so that on occasion [[Royal tours of Canada|royal visits to Canada]] are also referred to by [[Monarchism in Canada|monarchists]] as "Royal Homecomings." These events are often marked with a variety of ceremonies, the granting of honours, and general celebrations, even though these events are not always official holidays.

The Queen regularly undertakes tours of Canada to celebrate [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]], milestone anniversaries, military remembrances, and the like. Other royals will perform the same tasks in the Queen's place, from time to time, usually on a less grand scale or for events of a lesser importance. These tours are at the invitation of, organized, and paid for by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]], provincial government, or a combination of both; hence, they are called "official tours" or "official visits."<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4384.asp#2.5 Buckingham Palace: Guidelines and Procedures for the Acceptance, Classification, Retention and Disposal of Gifts to Members of the Royal Family]</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of monarchy in Canada}}
[[Image:Francis1-1.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Francis I of France]]; established colonies in [[Acadia]] and Canada, 1534]]

The first French and British colonizers of Canada interpreted the hereditary nature of some indigenous [[North America]]n chieftainships as a form of monarchy, often referring to these leaders as kings and their lands as kingdoms.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html The Four Indian Kings]</ref> There is also evidence that the aboriginals had a similar understanding of monarchy, most notably in the legend of the [[Kingdom of Saguenay]], and tales of "wealthy kingdoms in the north" told by [[Iroquois|Iroquoians]] to [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534.<ref>[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History]</ref><ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003]</ref>

Canada has been the territory of a monarchy, or a monarchy in its own right, since the establishment of [[New France]]. Territory of the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]] was merged with the North American colonies under the [[British monarchy|British Crown]] through the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in [[1763]]. In [[1867]], Canada became a self-governing [[Dominion]] under the British Crown (originally intended to be named the [[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Kingdom of Canada]]), and, from that date to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, Canada developed into a kingdom in its own right. Thus, kings and queens reigning over Canada have included the [[List of French monarchs|monarchs of France]] (from [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1534 to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1763), [[List of British monarchs|those of the UK]] (from [[Anne of Great Britain]] in 1713 to [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1952), to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Canada today.

Canada's emergence as a sovereign constitutional monarchy after 1931 was demonstrated in the abdication of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] in 1936; when Canada had to pass its own [[Succession to the Throne Act]], which effected changes to the rules of succession in Canada so that they matched those within the other realms of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]].<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onsc/2003/2003onsc11019.html O'Donohue v. Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada]</ref>  A few years later, Canada's new status was again demonstrated when King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and Queen [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]] travelled from Canada into the United States as King and Queen of Canada.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/05/0532/053201/053201130206_e.html The Royal Tour of 1939]</ref>  The [[Constitution Act of 1982]] was said to have entrenched the monarchy in Canada, due to the stringent requirements, as laid out in the amending formula, that must be met to alter the monarchy in any way.

Continuing the tradition started in the early 1800s, throughout the 20th century members of the Royal Family coninued to tour the country, as the viceroy and/or to mark key events.  A milestone was reached in 1939, when King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] became the first reigning monarch to tour Canada, as well as to visit the [[United States]] as King of Canada.  As ease of travel increased, visits by the sovereign and/or Royal Family members became more and more frequent, seeing the Queen Elizabeth II officiate at such important moments as the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in [[1959 in Canada|1959]]; the [[Canadian Centennial]] in [[1967 in Canada|1967]]; the opening of the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]; the [[patriation]] of the Constitution in [[1982 in Canada|1982]], the 500th anniversary, in [[1997 in Canada|1997]], of [[John Cabot|Cabot's]] landing at [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista]]; and more.  However, through the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of [[Quebec nationalism]] and changes in Canadian identity created an atmosphere where the purpose and role of the monarchy [[Debate on the Canadian monarchy|came into question]]. Some references to the monarch and the monarchy were slowly removed from the public eye, and moves were made by the federal government to constitutionally alter the monarchy's place and role in Canada, though the system has remained essentially the same.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf#search='quebec%20monarchy' Dr. Stephen Phillips; Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark]</ref>

In 1999, it was reported in the media that the federal government was considering the idea of changing Canada to a [[republic]], news that drew some negative reaction, and denial by the then Prime Minister. A survey of the provincial premiers at the time showed only one in favour of such a move.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/loyalty.htm Premiers Nix Monarchy Abolition: "NOT A GOVERNMENT PROJECT AT THIS POINT"]</ref>  Soon after, the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Golden Jubilee]] took place in 2002, celebrating Elizabeth II's fifty years as Queen of Canada; the concurrent country-wide tour by the sovereign and her [[List of Canadian monarchs#List of Royal Consorts of Canada|consort]], and the attendant [[fête]]s, proved popular with Canadians. 

==Canadian Royal Family==
{{dablink|The Canadian Royal Family is shared between the [[Commonwealth realm]]s; this article focuses on the perspective of [[Canada]]. For information on the Royal Family in the other realms, see [[#Other Realms: Royal Family|Other realms: Royal Family]].}}
[[Image:Roy-fam-canada.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Canadian Royal Family gathers in [[Lac-Brome, Quebec]], 1976 (left to right: the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] (now [[Princess Royal]]), [[Mark Phillips]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] (now [[Earl of Wessex]]), the Queen, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] (now [[Duke of York]]) and the [[Prince of Wales]]).]]

The '''Canadian Royal Family''' is a group of people closely related to the monarch of Canada;<ref>[http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ps/nap/comm/deaw_e.html#hon Ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs: Commissionners of the Territories: Honours of Office]</ref> it is a non-resident royal family, as those who comprise the group live in the [[United Kingdom]]. Members of perform ceremonial and social duties but, aside from the monarch, have no role in the affairs of government.  Those who comprise the Royal Family carry the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] [[Majesty|His or Her Majesty]] (HM), [[Royal Highness|His or Her Royal Highness]] (HRH), or sometimes [[The Right Honourable]] (in [[French language|French]]: ''Sa Majesté'' (SM), ''Son Altesse Royale'' (SAR), and ''Le très honorable'').

It has been stated by the [http://www.crht.ca/ Canadian Royal Heritage Trust] that [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], due to his having lived in Canada between 1791 and 1800, and his being father of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], is "the ancestor of the modern Canadian Royal Family."<ref>[http://www.crht.ca/DiscoverMonarchyFiles/ArmedForces.html Toffoli, Gary; ''The Royal Family and the Armed Forces''; Canadian Royal Heritage Trust]</ref>  However, the concept of the Canadian Royal Family did not emerge until after the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. Though the act came into effect during the reign of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], Canadian officials only began to overtly consider putting the principles of Canada's new status as an independent [[Monarchy|kingdom]] into effect during the late [[1930s]].<ref name="Parl">[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Infoparl/english/issue.htm?param=130&art=820 Galbraith, William; ''Canadian Parliamentary Review'': Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit; Vol. 12, No. 3, 1989]</ref> At first, the monarch was the only member of the Royal Family to carry out public ceremonial duties solely on the advice of Canadian ministers; King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] became the first to do so when he dedicated the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial|Vimy Memorial]] in July, [[1936]] &ndash; one of his few obligations performed during his short reign.<ref>[http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/vimy/battle&CFID=14831976&CFTOKEN=67789669 Veterans Affairs Canada: VAC Canada Remembers: The Battle of Vimy Ridge - Fast Facts]</ref> Over the decades, however, the monarch's children, grandchildren, cousins, and their respective [[spouse]]s began to perform functions at the direction of the Canadian government, representing the monarch within Canada or abroad.

Despite the length of service, it was not until October 2002, when the term "Canadian Royal Family" was first used publicly and officially by a member of it: in a speech given to the [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut|Nunavut legislature]] at its opening, Queen Elizabeth II stated: "I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada's newest territory."<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4178.asp Text of The Queen's address to the Legislative Assembly in Nunavut, Canada, 4 October 2002]</ref>  Still, the Canadian media often still refers to the Royal Family as the "British Royal Family."<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/artsentertainment/article/163172Howell, Peter; ''Toronto Star'': Queen rules for city critics; December 20, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/WinnipegSun/News/2005/04/11/991413-sun.html Canadian Press; Winnipeg Sun: Royal wedding details emerge; April 11, 2005]</ref>

[[Image:Roy-fam-2007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Members of the Royal Family gathered for a dinner celebrating the 60th wedding anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh.]]
Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Royal Family; her family is considered Canada's Royal Family.<ref>[http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ps/nap/comm/deaw_e.html#hon Ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs: Commissionners of the Territories: Honours of Office]</ref> Those in the direct line of succession owe their allegiance to Elizabeth II specifically as the Queen of Canada,<ref name="Noonan">Noonan, Peter C.; ''The Crown and Constitutional Law in Canada''; Sripnoon Publications, Calgary; 1998</ref> and, according to the [[Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces|Department of National Defence]], members of the family who bear the style "Royal Highness" are subjects of the Canadian monarch,<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: ''The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces''; pg 281]</ref>  They are entitled to [[Diplomatic missions of Canada|Canadian consular assistance]] and to the protection of the Queen's [[Canadian Forces|armed forces of Canada]] when they are outside of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, and in need of protection or aid.<ref name="Noonan" /> Their position as subjects but not citizens of Canada is reflected in the confusion that arises around the awarding of honours to members of the Royal Family; for example, the [[Order of Canada]] bestowed upon [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|the Queen Mother]] was only honorary, though the [[Canadian Forces Decoration]] awarded to her was not.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/celebrations.htm Queen Mother appointed to Order of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&DocIDCd=2N0018 Commemoration Service for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,C.C.]</ref>

Although there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the Royal Family<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/faqs/britfaq.html#p2-2 Heraldica: FAQ]</ref> &ndash; a royal family is loosely defined as the extended family of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] &ndash; according to former [[Minister of Canadian Heritage and Status of Women|Minister of Canadian Heritage]] [[Sheila Copps]], the Canadian federal government does maintain an official list of Royal Family members for matters of honours and protocol.<ref name="Copps" />  Because of the [[Commonwealth Realm#Nature of the Crown|shared nature of the Crown]], most members of the Canadian Royal Family are also members of the [[British Royal Family]], and are thus also members of the [[House of Windsor]]. There are some exceptions, however; for instance [[Angus Ogilvy]] was included in the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]'s Royal Family list,<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/_00_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: Royal Family]</ref> whereas he was not considered a member of the British Royal Family.

There has been one marriage of a Canadian citizen into the extended royal family, and a second such marriage is expected to take place soon. In 1988, [[Sylvana Jones]] (neé Tomaselli) married [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews]], a great-grandson of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].  On [[July 28]], [[2007]], the engagement was announced of [[Peter Phillips]] to [[Autumn Kelly]], of Montreal;<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/News/article/240930 Associated Press; ''Toronto Star'': Canadian to marry into royalty; July 28, 2007]</ref> Phillips is the son of [[Princess Anne]], and the eldest grandchild of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Divorced spouses of the monarch's descendants are removed from the official government list of Royal Family members, as was the case with [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].<ref name="Copps">[http://www.torontosun.com/News/Columnists/Copps_Sheila/2006/04/26/1550711.html Copps, Sheila; ''Toronto Sun: PM should ignore flag bureaucrats'']; [[April 26]], [[2006]]</ref>

Canadian poet [[George Elliott Clarke]] has publicly opined on a fully [[First Nations]] royal family, asking "why can't a truly Canadian royal family be Aboriginal or [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]? I think the project... would do wonders for national identity and national unity."<ref>[http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/senate/news.cfm?story=36105 Lingley, Scott; University of Alberta Senate: ''Clarke calls on grads to help achieve the ideals of Canada''; June 7, 2005]</ref> However, this would contravene the convention laid out in the preamble to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (a part of the Canadian Constitution).

The existence of a Canadian royal family has been contested by some, mostly in the small [[Debate on the monarchy in Canada|Canadian republican movement]]. However, [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]] [[Iona Campagnolo]] has also stated she feels Canada does not "really have a royal family."<ref name="McCullough" />
:''See also: [[British Royal Family#List of members|List of Members]]''

===Styles===
Unlike in the United Kingdom, in Canada the sovereign is the only member of the Royal Family who has a title established through law. Though it would be possible for other members of the Royal Family to be granted distinctly Canadian titles (as is the case for the [[Duke of Rothesay]] in [[Scotland]]), they have always been, and continue to only be accorded the use of a [[courtesy title]], which is the style they have been granted via [[Letters Patent]] in the United Kingdom.

However, in Canada these styles are also translated to [[French language|French]]. The most senior members of the Royal Family are styled as follows:
* His [[Royal Highness]] [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]]: ''Son Altesse Royale le prince Philip, duc d'Édimbourg''
* His Royal Highness [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]]: ''Son Altesse Royale le prince de Galles''
* His Royal Highness [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]]: ''Son Altesse Royale le duc d'York''
* His Royal Highness [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Earl of Wessex]]: ''Son Altesse Royale le comte de Wessex''
* Her Royal Highness [[Sophie, The Countess of Wessex|The Countess of Wessex]]: ''Son Altesse Royale la comtesse de Wessex''
* Her Royal Highness [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]]: ''Son Altesse Royale la princesse Royale''

===Popularity===
The popularity of the Royal Family with Canadians, as well as individual members of it, has fluctuated over the years. Mirroring the mood in the United Kingdom, the family's lowest approval was during the mid [[1980s]] to [[1990s]] when the children of the monarch were enduring their [[divorce]]s, and were the targets of negative [[tabloid]] reporting. Some recent poll results follow:

* An [[EKOS]] Poll conducted in May 2002, concluded that 35% of Canadians found the Royal Family boring, 52% saw them as interesting, with 12% stating neither. 44% said they were irrelevant, 46% said the opposite, and 8% said neither. 59% saw the Royal Family as tired, 22% deemed them vibrant, and 17% put them at neither.<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf EKOS: ''Trust and the Monarchy: and examination of the shifting public attitudes toward government and institutions''; May 30, 2002]</ref>
* A March 2005, [[Decima Research]] Poll found some interesting support levels for members of the Royal Family. 71% of Canadians had a favourable impression of the Royal Family. Only 20% had an unfavourable impression of the Royal Family. The poll found that 28% of Canadians saw the Queen as their favourite member of the Royal Family, [[Prince William of Wales|Prince William]] was second with 26%, [[Prince Henry of Wales|Prince Harry]] was third with 9%, Prince Charles was fourth with 6% and Prince Philip last with 2% support.

[[Image:Rideau Hall04.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Rideau Hall, the monarch's principal Canadian residence, though foremostly that of the Governor General.]]
The sovereign's primary official residence is [[Rideau Hall]] in the city of [[Ottawa]].<ref name="Parl" /><ref>Lanctot, Gustave; ''Royal Tour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Canada and the United States of America 1939''; E.P. Taylor Foundation; 1964</ref><ref name="Mon">[http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/palace.htm Aimers, John; ''Monarchy Canada'': The Palace on the Rideau; April 1996]</ref>, which is also the official home of the Governor General. Rideau Hall is the site of most state banquets, investitures, swearing-in of ministers, and other ceremonies. Moreover, visiting heads of state usually reside at that palace. Another principal residence is [[La Citadelle]], in [[Quebec City]], and is used principally as retreat for the Governor General.  The provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] also maintain residences, used primarily by the respective Lieutenant Governor, though the monarch or other members of the Royal Family will reside there when in the province.

The aforementioned residences belong to the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers, and cannot be sold by the monarch. However, monarchs have owned certain homes in a private capacity: King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] owned Bedingfield Ranch, near Pekisko, [[High River, Alberta|High River]], [[Alberta]].

==The Crown and the First Nations==
{{Main|The Canadian Crown and First Nations, Inuit and Métis}}

The Crown has a long relationship with the [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples of [[Canada]].  As with the [[Māori]] and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in [[New Zealand]], Canada's [[First Nations]] view their treaties as being agreements directly between them and the Crown, not with the ever-changing [[government of Canada]]. The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] remains an important document, mentioned in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], outlining the Crown's responsibility to protect First Nations' territories.<ref>[http://www.ualberta.ca/~nativest/pim/waitangi.htm A Historical Analysis of Early Nation to Nation Relations in Canada and New Zealand:The Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Treaty of Niagara and The Treaty of Waitangi]</ref><ref>[http://www.treaty6.ca/princ.html Fundamental Treaty Principals]</ref>

Over the centuries there have been literal and symbolic gestures to demonstrate the "nation-to-nation" relationship, from the commemoration by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] of the "[[Four Mohawk Kings]]" in 1710,<ref>[http://www.tyendinaga.net/history/ Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]</ref> to Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] donating a piece of [[Balmoral]] granite engraved with the ciphers of [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and herself to the [[First Nations University of Canada]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050511%2FNATIVES11%2FTPNational%2FCanada&ord=1169237438207&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true Monchuk, Judy; ''The Globe and Mail'': Natives decry 'token' presence for Queen's visit; May 11, 2005]</ref>  The First Nations, in return, honour members of the Royal Family with ceremonies and traditional titles.

==The Crown and the Canadian Forces==
{{Main|The Canadian Crown and the Canadian Forces}}

The Crown holds a prominent place within the [[Canadian Forces]]. The Queen is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the entire Forces, though the Governor General holds this title and exercises the duties on behalf of the sovereign.<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/cc/hist_e.asp Governor General of Canada: Commander in Chief of the Canadian Forces]</ref> The Queen is also the Honorary Commissioner of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].<ref>[http://www.regiments.org/biography/royals/1926eliz.htm Land Forces: H.M. Elizabeth II Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]</ref>

The sovereign's position and role in the military is reflected by [[navy|naval vessels]] bearing the prefix [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship]] (HMCS) &ndash; His Majesty's Canadian Ship during the reign of a king &ndash; and all members of the Armed Forces must swear allegiance to the Queen and her heirs and successors.  Members of the Royal Family are also [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of many Canadian regiments.  As such, members of the Royal Family have presided over many military ceremonies both abroad and at home, including [[Trooping the Colour]]s, inspections of the troops, and anniversaries of key battles; whenever the sovereign or a member of her family is in [[Ottawa]], they lay a wreath at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]].

==Organizations with royal association==
Besides government and military institutions, a number of Canadian civilian organizations have associations with the monarchy, either through their being founded via a Royal Charter, or because at least one member of the Royal Family serves as a patron.

===Organizations under Royal Charter===
{{Main|Royal Charter}}
A [[Royal Charter]] is granted by the monarch on the advice of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]], which creates or gives special status to an incorporated body. This is an exercise of the [[Royal Prerogative]], and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organizations under Royal Charters. Such organizations include charities, businesses, colleges, universities, and cities.  Today, it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters.

Examples of organizations under Royal Charter are: the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], founded by Royal Charter issued by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in [[1670]];<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/royal-quiz-answers.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Test your royal skills]</ref> [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], receiving its charter in 1786 from King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]];<ref>[http://www.canadascities.ca/caoreport_062000_1.htm#3 ''Canada's Cities: Unleash our Potential'']</ref> and [[McGill University]], which received a Royal Charter from King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in [[1821]].

===Canadian Organizations with royal patronage===
[[Image:UCC-duke.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Queen's consort [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] speaks with UCC First Football team members at the [[Upper Canada College]]'s 150th anniversary celebrations, 1979.]]
Until [[Industrial Revolution|modern industrial]] times, all development of the [[science]]s and the [[art]]s were under the direct control of the monarch, exercised by the foundation of [[college]]s that today form the basis of modern [[universities]]. The endowments to provide for these colleges were established by [[the Crown]] to further education in both ecclesiastical and [[secularism|secular]] matters.

As time progressed, the educated members of these organizations formed into groups to lecture, demonstrate and [[debate]] their various subjects. These groups either sought royal patronage, or were created as [[memorial]]s for the predecessors of the reigning monarch. Other colleges and foundations have been endowed by the owners of the great [[Estate (law)|landed estates]] and, in later times, by industrialists and finally modern [[corporation|corporate bodies]].  However, even in present times, relatively new organizations still seek royal patronage, though it is a ceremonial function wherein the royal will either volunteer their time for service or make a charitable donation.  To receive royal patronage, an organization must prove to be long lasting.

==Awards and charities==
A number of awards in Canada are issued in the name of previous or present members of the Royal Family. These include:

* The [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] ''[[Prince of Wales Trophy]]'', donated by and named for [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]]

Charities and volunteer organizations have also been founded as gifts to, or in honour of some of Canada's monarchs, or members of the Royal Family.  These include:
* The [[Victorian Order of Nurses]] was a gift to Queen Victoria for her [[Diamond Jubilee#Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria|Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897
* The Canadian Cancer Fund was set up in honour of King George V's [[Silver Jubilee#Silver Jubilees in the United Kingdom|Silver Jubilee]] in 1935

* The Queen Elizabeth II Trust Fund to assist young Canadians in better understanding each other's language and culture was established during Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee in 1977{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

==Debate==
{{main|Debate on the monarchy in Canada}}

To date, there has been little national debate about ending the monarchy in Canada, in contrast to some other [[Commonwealth realm]]s where the issue has gained a relatively higher profile.  Many Canadians continue to be unaware that the Queen serves as their head of state; a 2002 [[EKOS Research Associates|EKOS]] poll found that only five percent of Canadians could correctly identify Elizabeth II as Canada's head of state (the majority believing it to be the Prime Minister).<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf Eskos poll]</ref>

Where debate does exist, it tends to be a largely academic one, and several books have been written that explore the subject from a [[political science]] perspective. Neither of Canada's two main political parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] or the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], are officially in favour of abolishing the monarchy; though the latter makes support for constitutional monarchy a founding principle in its policy declaration.<ref>[http://www.conservative-own.ca/documents/policy031905.pdf#search='conservative%20party%20of%20canada%20objectives%20monarchy' Conservative Party of Canada: Policy Declaration]</ref> The [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) has no official position on the role of the monarchy. Unlike other Commonwealth realms, Canada has never had a head of government who has been openly republican.  Some politicians, having pledged allegiance to the Queen, have occasionally publicly voiced their opinion on the matter, following former-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Manley (politician)|John Manley]]'s 2002 statement that he was in favour of abolishing the monarchy &ndash; later stating that it was his personal opinion.

The one province that has shown significant republican sentiment is [[Quebec]]; the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' has at times expressed hostility to the institution of the monarchy. However, as the party views [[Quebec sovereignty]] as a more pressing concern, and sees the Crown as a purely federal institution (despite the existence of the [[Monarchy in Quebec|Crown in Right of Quebec]]), it has recently tended to decline comment on the issue. 

Canada has two special-interest groups representing both sides of the debate, who frequently argue the issue in the media: [[Monarchist League of Canada]] and the [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]].
