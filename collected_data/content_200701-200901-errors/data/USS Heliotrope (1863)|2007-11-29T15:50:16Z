'''USS ''Heliotrope'' (1863)''' was a wooden [[Steamboat|steamer]] acquired by the [[Union Navy]] for use during the [[American Civil War]]. In addition to patrol duty, ''Heliotrope'' performed other services, such as towing and dispatch running.

''Heliotrope'', a wooden steamer, was originally named ''Maggie Baker'', and was purchased by the Navy from her owner, Stacey Pitcher, at [[New York City]] on [[16 December]] [[1863]]. Renamed ''Heliotrope'', she commissioned at [[New York Navy Yard]] [[24 April]] [[1864]].

== Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade ==
 
''Heliotrope'' was assigned initially to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]], and sailed soon after her commissioning to [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], where she served as a tug and ordnance boat. She continued this duty with occasional patrols up the [[James River, Virginia|James River]], until her transfer to the [[Potomac Flotilla]] [[23 January]] [[1865]].

== A destructive mission up the Rappahannock ==
 
''Heliotrope'' reported for her new duties early in February, and participated 6-[[8 March]] in a joint expedition up the [[Rappahannock River]] to [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. In cooperation with Army units, ''Heliotrope'' and the other [[gunboats]] succeeded in destroying railroad facilities, a large quantity of track, and a depot of army supplies. Returning to routine patrolling in the [[Potomac River]], she embarked with other gunboats on another expedition [[16 March]], sending her small boats with about 50 men up [[Mattox Creek]]. Three [[schooners]] and various types of supplies were captured or destroyed on this 2-day foray.

== Decommissioning ==
 
The small gunboat continued her vital work of choking off [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supplies in the Potomac River area until mid-April, when she steamed for [[New York City]], arriving [[20 April]]. ''Heliotrope'' decommissioned [[12 January]] [[1865]] and was sold [[17 June]] to the [[Department of the Treasury]] for use with the [[Lighthouse Service]].
