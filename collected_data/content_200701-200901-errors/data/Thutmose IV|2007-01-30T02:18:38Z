'''Thutmose IV''' (sometimes read as ''Thutmosis'' or ''Tuthmosis IV'' and meaning ''[[Thoth]] is Born'') was the 8th [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] of [[History of Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. He ruled from Egypt from either [[1401 BC]] to [[1391 BC]] or [[1397 BC]] to [[1388 BC]]<ref>Jürgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen Ägypten. Philipp von Zabern, Mainz, (1997) p.190</ref> and is ascribed a reign of 9 Years and 8 Months by Manetho. This figure is affirmed by a Year 8 stela from his reign in Nubia. Thutmose IV was once thought to have enjoyed a much longer reign of 34-35 years but this figure is not substantiated by the small number of monuments which he left behind compared to those of his son Amenhotep III, as well as the complete absence of attested dates for him after his 8th Year.     

Thutmose IV was born to [[Amenhotep II]] and Tiaa and but was not actually the crown prince and Amenhotep II's chosen successor to the throne. Some scholars speculate that Thutmose ousted his older brother in order to usurp power and then commissioned the construction of the ''[[Dream Stele]]'' in order to justify his kingship. The restoration of the Sphinx and the text of the ''Dream Stele'' would then be a piece of propoganda on Thutmose's part, meant to bestow legitimacy upon his unexpected kingship. Little is known about his brief ten-year rule. He suppressed an uprising in [[Nubia]] in his 8th Year around [[1393 BC]] and was referred to in a [[stela]] as the ''Conqueror of [[Ancient Syria|Syria]]''<ref>Peter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames & Hudson Ltd, 1994., p.114</ref>, but little else has been pieced together of his military exploits. Thutmose established good relations with [[Mitanni]] and married a Mitannian princess after much negotiations. 

Like most Thutmosids, he built on a large scale. Thutmose IV completed an [[obelisk]] first started by [[Thutmose III of Egypt|Thutmose III]], which, at 32 m (105 feet), was the tallest obelisk ever erected in Egypt, at the Temple of [[Karnak]].<ref>Clayton, op. cit., p.114</ref> It was transported to Rome by a later Roman Emperor and today stands at [[Saint Peter's Square]] in the Vatican. 

Thutmose's most celebrated accomplishment was the restoration of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] at [[Giza]] and subsequent commission of the ''[[Dream Stele]]''. According to Thutmose's account on the ''Dream Stele'', while out on a hunting trip he stopped to rest under the head of the Sphinx, which was buried up to the neck in sand. He soon fell asleep and had a dream in which the Sphinx told him that if he cleared away the sand and restored it he would become the next Pharaoh. After completing the restoration he placed a carved stone tablet, now known as the ''Dream Stele'', between the two paws of the Sphinx.

==Burial==
Thutmose IV was buried in the [[Valley of the Kings]], in tomb [[KV43]], but his body was moved to the mummy cache in [[KV35]], where it was discovered by [[Victor Loret]] in [[1898]]. An examination of his body shows that he was very ill and had been wasting away for the final months of his life prior to his death.
