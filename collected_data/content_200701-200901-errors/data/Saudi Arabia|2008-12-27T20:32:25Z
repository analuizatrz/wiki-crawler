The '''Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''', '''KSA''' ({{lang-ar|'''المملكة العربية السعودية'''}}, ''{{Unicode|al-Mamlaka al-ʻArabiyya as-Suʻūdiyya''}}), is an [[Arab]] country and the largest country of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It is bordered by [[Jordan]] on the northwest, [[Iraq]] on the north and northeast, [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] on the east, [[Oman]] on the southeast, and [[Yemen]] on the south. The [[Persian Gulf]] lies to the northeast and the [[Red Sea]] to its west. It has an estimated population of 27.6 million, and its size is approximately 2,150,000 square km (830,000 square miles).

The Kingdom is sometimes called "The Land of The Two Holy Mosques" in reference to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the two holiest places in [[Islam]]. In English, it is most commonly referred to as '''Saudi Arabia''' ({{pron-en|ˈsɔːdɪ}} or {{IPAlink-en|ˈsaʊdɪ əˈreɪbɪə}}). The current Kingdom was founded by Abdul-Aziz bin Saud, whose efforts began in 1902 when he captured the Al-Saud’s ancestral home of [[Riyadh]], and culminated in 1932 with the proclamation, and recognition of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia though its national origins go back as far as [[1744]] with the establishment of the [[First Saudi State]].

Saudi Arabia is the world's leading [[Petroleum#Export|petroleum exporter]]. [[Petroleum]] exports fuel the [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi economy]].<ref>[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/country/country_energy_data.cfm?fips=SA U.S. Energy Information Administration - Saudi Arabia Country Energy Profile]</ref> Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of exports and nearly 75 percent of government revenues, facilitating the creation of a [[welfare state]],<ref>[http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm Social Services 2]</ref><ref>[http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&InNewsItemID=1746 Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia-London: The Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia - A Welfare State]</ref> which the government has found difficult to fund during periods of low [[price of petroleum|oil price]]s.<ref>[http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=164957&Sn=BUSI&IssueID=29274 Gulf Daily News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of Saudi Arabia}}
[[Image:Azizfdr.jpg|thumb|The founder of modern Saudi Arabia, [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Abdul Aziz]], converses with U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] on board a ship returning from the [[Yalta Conference]] in 1945]]

Although the region in which the country stands today has an [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|ancient history]], the emergence of the Saudi dynasty began in central Arabia in 1744. That year, [[Muhammad ibn Saud]], the ruler of the town of [[Diriyah|Ad-Dir'iyyah]] near [[Riyadh]], joined forces with a cleric, [[Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab]], to create a new political entity. This alliance formed in the 18th century remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today. Over the next 150 years, the fortunes of the Saud family rose and fell several times as Saudi rulers contended with [[Egypt]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and other Arabian families for control on the peninsula (see [[First Saudi State]] and [[Second Saudi State]]). The third and current Saudi state was founded in the early 20th century by King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]] (known internationally as ''Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud'').

In 1902 at the age of only 22, Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud re-captured [[Riyadh]], the Al-Saud dynasty's ancestral capital, from the rival [[Al Rashid]] family. Continuing his conquests, Abdul Aziz subdued [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Al-Hasa]], [[Qatif|Al-Qatif]], the rest of [[Nejd]], and [[Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926. On January 8, 1926 Abdul Aziz bin Saud became the King of Hejaz. On January 29, 1927 he took the title King of Nejd (his previous Nejdi title was Sultan). By the [[Treaty of Jeddah]], signed on May 20, 1927, the United Kingdom recognized the independence of Abdul Aziz's realm, then known as the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]]. In 1932, the principal regions of Al-Hasa, Qatif, Nejd and Hejaz were unified to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Abdul Aziz's military and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of [[Petroleum|oil]] were discovered in March 1938. Development programmes, which were delayed due to the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, began in earnest in 1946 and by 1949 production was in full swing. Oil has provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of leverage in the international community.

Prior to his death in 1953 Abdul Aziz, aware of the difficulties facing other regional absolute rulers reliant on extended family networks, attempted to regulate the succession.

Saud succeeded to the throne on his father's death in 1953. However, by the early 1960s the Kingdom was in jeopardy due to Saud's economic mismanagement and failure to deal effectively with a regional challenge from [[President of Egypt|Egyptian president]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. As a consequence Saud was deposed in favour of Faisal in 1964.

Intra-family rivalry was one of the factors that led to the assassination of Faisal by his nephew, [[Faisal bin Musa'id|Prince Faisal bin Musa'id]], in 1975. He was succeeded by [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|King Khalid]] until 1982 and then by [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]. When Fahd died in 2005, his half-brother [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] ascended to the throne.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Saudi Arabia}}
[[Image:Saudi Arabia map.png|thumb|Map of Saudi Arabia]]
The kingdom occupies about 80 percent of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. In 2000 Saudi Arabia and Yemen signed an agreement to settle their long-running border dispute.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/788153.stm Yemen, Saudi Arabia sign border deal], ''BBC News'', June 12, 2000. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref> A significant length of the country's southern borders with the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Oman]], are not precisely defined or marked, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government's estimate is 2,217,949&nbsp;km² (856,356&nbsp;[[square mile|miles²]]). Other reputable estimates vary between 1,960,582&nbsp;km²<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html CIA World Factbook - Rank Order: Area]</ref> (756,934&nbsp;mi²) and 2,240,000&nbsp;km² (864,869&nbsp;mi²). The kingdom is commonly listed as the world's 14th largest state.

Saudi Arabia's geography is varied. From the western coastal region ([[Tihamah]]), the land rises from sea level to a peninsula-long mountain range (Jabal al-[[Hejaz]]) beyond which lies the plateau of [[Nejd]] in the center. The southwestern [['Asir]] region has mountains as high as 3,000 m (9,840&nbsp;ft) and is known for having the greenest and freshest climate in all of the country, one that attracts many Saudis to resorts such as [[Abha]] in the summer months. The east is primarily rocky or sandy lowland continuing to the shores of the [[Persian Gulf]]. The geographically hostile [[Rub' al Khali]] ("Empty Quarter") desert along the country's imprecisely defined southern borders contains almost no life.
[[Image:Saudi-desert.gif|thumb|left|Desert view in Saudi Arabia. The reddish color of sand and rocky hills in the background indicate this image was taken in the middle/western part of the kingdom]]
Mostly uninhabited, much of the nation's landmass consists of [[desert]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions, with a dwindling traditional [[Bedouin]] population. In these parts of the country, vegetation is limited to weeds, [[xerophyte|xerophytic]] herbs and shrubs. Less than two percent of the kingdom's total area is [[arable land]]. Population centers are mainly located along the eastern and western coasts and densely populated interior oases such as [[Hofuf]] and [[Buraydah]]. In some extended areas, primarily the Rub' al-Khali and the [[Arabian Desert]], there is no population whatsoever, although the petroleum industry is constructing a few planned communities there. Saudi Arabia has no permanent year-round rivers or lakes; however, its coastline extends for 2640 km (1640&nbsp;miles) and, on the [[Red Sea]] side, offers world-class coral reefs, including those in the [[Gulf of Aqaba]].

Native animals include the [[ibex]], [[wildcat]]s, [[baboon]]s, [[gray wolf|wolves]], and [[hyena]]s in the mountainous highlands. Small birds are found in the [[oasis|oases]]. The coastal area on the Red Sea with its [[coral reef]]s has a rich [[marine biology|marine life]].

===Climate ===
Extreme heat and aridity are characteristic of most of Saudi Arabia. It is one of the few places in the world where summer temperatures above 50 °[[Celsius|C]] (122 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) have been recorded,{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 51.7 °C (124 °F) being the highest ever recorded temperature. In winter, frost or snow can occur in the interior and the higher mountains, although this only occurs once or twice in a decade. Lowest ever recorded temperature is -12.0 °C recorded at Turaif. The average winter temperature range is 8° to 20 °C (47° to 68 °F) in January in interior cities such as Riyadh and 19° to 29 °C (66° to 83 °F) in [[Jeddah]] on the Red Sea coast. The average summer range in July is 27° to 43 °C (81° to 109 °F) in Riyadh and 27° to 38 °C (80° to 100 °F) in Jeddah. Nighttime temperatures in the central deserts can be famously chilly even in summer, as the sand gives up daytime heat rapidly once the sun has set. Annual precipitation is usually sparse (up to 100 mm or 4&nbsp;[[inch]]es in most regions), although sudden downpours can lead to violent [[flash flood]]s in [[wadi]]s. Annual rainfall in Riyadh averages 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;inches) and falls almost exclusively between January and May; the average in Jeddah is 54&nbsp;mm (2.1&nbsp;inches) and occurs between November and January.

{{main|Politics of Saudi Arabia}}
[[Image:Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] of Saudi Arabia]]

The central institution of the Saudi Arabian government is the [[House of Saud|Saudi monarchy]]. The ''Basic Law of Government'' adopted in 1992 declared that Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the sons and grandsons of the first king, [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abd Al Aziz Al Saud]]. It also claims that the [[Qur'an]] is the [[constitution]] of the country, which is governed on the basis of the Sharia (Islamic Law). According to [[The Economist]]'s [[Democracy Index]], the Saudi government is the ninth most authoritarian regime in the world.

There are no recognized political parties or national elections, except the local elections which were held in the year 2005 when participation was reserved for male citizens only.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3734420.stm Saudi women barred from voting], ''BBC News'', October 11, 2004. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref> The king's powers are theoretically limited within the bounds of Shari'a and other Saudi traditions. He also must retain a consensus of the Saudi royal family, religious leaders (''[[ulema]]''), and other important elements in Saudi society. The Saudi government spreads [[Islam]] by funding construction of mosques and [[Madrasah|Qur'an schools]] around the world. The leading members of the royal family choose the king from among themselves with the subsequent approval of the ulema.

Saudi kings have gradually developed a central government. Since 1953, the Council of Ministers, appointed by the king, has advised on the formulation of general policy and directed the activities of the growing bureaucracy. This council consists of a prime minister, the first prime minister and twenty ministers.

Legislation is by resolution of the Council of Ministers, ratified by [[Decree|royal decree]], and must be compatible with the Shari'a. A 150-member [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia|Consultative Assembly]], appointed by the King, has limited legislative rights. [[Justice]] is administered according to the Shari'a by a system of religious courts whose judges are appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council, composed of twelve senior jurists. [[Independence]] of the judiciary is protected by law. The king acts as the highest court of appeal and has the power to pardon. Access to high officials (usually at a ''majlis''; a public audience) and the [[right to petition]] them directly are well-established traditions.

The combination of relatively high oil prices and exports led to a revenues windfall for Saudi Arabia during 2004 and early 2005. For 2004 as a whole, Saudi Arabia earned about $116 billion in net oil export revenues, up 35 percent from 2003 revenue levels. Saudi net oil export revenues are forecast to increase in 2005 and 2006, to $150 billion and $154 billion, respectively, mainly due to higher oil prices. Increased oil prices and consequent revenues since the price collapse of 1998 have significantly improved Saudi Arabia's economic situation, with real GDP growth of 5.2 percent in 2004, and forecasts of 5.7% and 4.8% growth for 2005 and 2006, respectively.

For [[fiscal year]] 2004, Saudi Arabia originally had been expecting a [[Deficit|budget deficit]]. However, this was based on an extremely conservative price assumption of $19 per barrel for Saudi oil and an assumed production of {{convert|7.7|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}<!--barrels per day?-->. Both of these estimates turned out to be far below actual levels. As a result, as of mid-December 2004, the Saudi Finance Ministry was expecting a huge budget surplus of $26.1 billion, on budget revenues of $104.8 billion (nearly double the country's original estimate) and expenditures of $78.6 billion (28 percent above the approved budget levels). This surplus is being used for several purposes, including: paying down the Kingdom's public debt (to $164 billion from $176 billion at the start of 2004); extra spending on education and development projects; increased security expenditures (possibly an additional $2.5 billion dollars in 2004; see below) due to threats from terrorists; and higher payments to Saudi citizens through subsidies (for housing, education, health care, etc.). For 2005, Saudi Arabia is assuming a balanced budget, with revenues and expenditures of $74.6 billion each.

In spite of the recent surge in its oil income, Saudi Arabia continues to face serious long-term economic challenges, including high rates of unemployment (12 percent of Saudi nationals),<ref>Ghafour, P.K. Abdul. [http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=95003&d=15&m=4&y=2007 470,000 Saudis Are Jobless, Says Study], ''Arab News'', April 15, 2007. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref> one of the world's fastest population growth rates, and the consequent need for increased government spending. All of these place pressures on Saudi oil revenues. The Kingdom also is facing serious security threats, including a number of terrorist attacks (on foreign workers, primarily) in 2003 and 2004. In response, the Saudis reportedly have ramped up spending in the security area (reportedly by 50 percent in 2004, from $5.5 billion in 2003). Saudi Arabia's per capita oil export revenues remain far below high levels reached during the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2007, Saudi Arabia's citizens earned around $20,700 per person, versus $22,589 in 1980, but it is catching up. This 80 percent decline in real per capita oil export revenues since 1980 is in large part because Saudi Arabia's young population has nearly tripled since 1980, while oil export revenues in real terms have fallen by over 40 percent (despite recent increases). Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has faced nearly two decades of heavy budget and trade deficits, the expensive 1990-1991 war with Iraq, and total public debt of around $175 billion. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia does have extensive foreign assets (around $110 billion) which provide a substantial fiscal "cushion."

[[Saudi Arabian municipal elections, 2005|Saudi municipal elections]] took place in 2005 and some commentators saw this as a first tentative step towards the introduction of [[democracy|democratic]] processes in the Kingdom, including the legalization of political parties. Other analysts of the Saudi political scene were more skeptical.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4252079.stm 'Islamist win' in key Saudi poll], ''BBC News'', February 11, 2005. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref>

==== Law ====

The [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Basic Law]], in 1992, declared that Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the progeny of [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Abd Al Aziz Al Saud]]. It also declared the [[Qur'an]] as the constitution of the country, governed on the basis of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].<ref name = Jurist>[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia]. JURIST</ref>

Criminal cases are tried under Sharia courts in the country. These courts exercise authority over the entire population including foreigners (regardless of religion). Cases involving small penalties are tried in Shari'a summary courts. More serious crimes are adjudicated in Shari'a courts of common pleas. Courts of appeal handle appeals from Shari'a courts.<ref name = Jurist/>

Civil cases may also be tried under Sharia courts with one exception: Shia may try such cases in their own courts. Other civil proceedings, including those involving claims against the Government and enforcement of foreign judgments, are held before specialized administrative tribunals, such as the Commission for the Settlement of Labor Disputes and the Board of Grievances.<ref name = Jurist/>

Main sources of Saudi law are [[Hanbali]] [[fiqh]] as set out in a number of specified scholarly treatises by authoritative jurists, other schools of law, state regulations and royal decrees (where these are relevant), and custom and practice.<ref name =emory>[http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of]</ref>

The Saudi legal system prescribes [[capital punishment]] or [[corporal punishment]], including [[amputation]]s of hands and feet for certain crimes such as [[murder]], [[robbery]], rape, drug smuggling, [[homosexuality|homosexual activity]], and [[adultery]]. The courts may impose less severe punishments, such as [[Flagellation|floggings]], for less serious crimes against [[public morality]] such as [[drunkenness]].<ref>[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/saudi/saudi.pdf Human Rights in Saudi Arabia: A Deafening Silence]</ref>
Murder, accidental death and bodily harm are open to punishment from the victim's family. Retribution may be sought in kind or through [[Blood money (term)#In Islam|blood money]]. The blood money payable for a woman's accidental death is half as much as that for a man.<ref>[http://www.jeansasson.com/law_and_government.htm Saudi Arabian Government and Law]</ref> The main reason for this is that, according to Islamic law, men are expected to be providers for their families and therefore are expected to earn more money in their lifetimes. The blood money from a man would be expected to sustain his family, for at least a short time. Honor killings are also not punished as severely as murder. This generally stems from the fact that honor killings are within a family, and done to compensate for some dishonorable act committed. [[Slavery]] was abolished in 1962.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_8.shtml BBC - Religion & Ethics - Islam and slavery: Abolition]</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24160 Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History]</ref>

=== Human rights ===

{{main|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}
Several international [[human rights]] organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]] and the [[United Nations]] Human Rights Committee have issued reports critical of the Saudi legal system and its human rights record in various political, legal, and social areas, especially its severe limitations on the rights of women. The Saudi government typically dismisses such reports as being outright lies or asserts that its actions are based on its adherence to Islamic law.

In 2002, the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Committee against Torture]] criticized Saudi Arabia over the amputations and floggings it carries out under the Shari'a. The Saudi delegation responded defending its legal traditions held since the inception of Islam in the region 1300 years ago and rejected "interference" in its legal system.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1992027.stm Saudi 'torture' condemned by UN], ''BBC News'', May 16, 2002. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref>

Saudi Arabia is also the only country in the world where women are banned from driving on public roads. Women may drive off-road and in private housing compounds - some of which extend to many square miles.<ref>Hassan, Ibtihal; Hammond, Andrew. [http://www.reuters.com/article/basicindustries-SP-A/idUSL1071429920071210 Car makers target Saudi women despite driving ban], ''Reuters'', December 10, 2007.

The Government views its interpretation of Islamic law as its sole source of guidance on human rights. In 2000, the Government approved the October legislation, which the Government claimed would address some of its obligations under the Convention Against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.<ref name = Jurist/>

[[Image:SaudiArabiaNetExports.PNG|thumb|250px|Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter of [[petroleum]] in the world]]

Saudi Arabia's economy is petroleum-based; roughly 75% of budget revenues and 90% of export earnings come from the oil industry. The oil industry comprises about 45% of Saudi Arabia's [[gross domestic product]], compared with 40% from the private sector (see below). Saudi Arabia officially has about {{convert|260|Goilbbl|m3}} of [[oil reserves]], comprising about 24% of the world's proven total petroleum reserves.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/reserves.html World Proved Reserves of Oil and Natural Gas, Most Recent Estimates]</ref>

The government is attempting to promote growth in the private sector by privatizing industries such as power and telecom. Saudi Arabia announced plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies in 1999, which followed the ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company. Shortages of water and rapid population growth may constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural products.

In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 in 1998.<ref>[http://www.jica.go.jp/english/global/pov/profiles/pdf/sau_eng.pdf Country Profile Study on Poverty: Saudi Arabia]</ref> Recent oil price increases have helped boost per capita GDP to $17,000 in 2007 dollars,<ref>[[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]]</ref> or about $7,400 adjusted for inflation.<ref>[http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl CPI Inflation Calculator]</ref>

Recent oil price increases have triggered a second oil boom, pushing Saudi Arabia's budget surplus to $28 billion (110SR billion) in 2005. [[Tadawul]] (the Saudi stock market index) finished 2004 with a massive 76.23% to close at 4437.58 points. [[Market capitalization]] was up 110.14% from a year earlier to stand at $157.3 billion (589.93SR billion), which makes it the biggest stock market in the [[Middle East]].‏

OPEC limits its members' oil production based on their "proven reserves." The higher their reserves, the more OPEC allows them to produce.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Saudi Arabia's published reserves have shown little change since 1980, with the main exception being an increase of about {{convert|100|Goilbbl|m3}} between 1987 and 1988.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/crudeoilreserves.xls Crude Oil Reserves]</ref>  [[Matthew Simmons]] has suggested that Saudi Arabia is greatly exaggerating its reserves and may soon show production declines (see [[peak oil]]).<ref> {{cite book

To diversify the economy, Saudi Arabia launched a new city on the western coast with investments exceeding $26.6 billion. The city, which is named "[[King Abdullah Economic City]]", will be built near al-Rabegh industrial city north to Jeddah. The new city, where construction work started in December 2005, includes a port which is the largest port of the kingdom. Extending along a coastline of 35&nbsp;km, the city will also include petrochemical, pharmaceutical, tourism, finance and education and research areas. Saudi Arabia officially became a [[World Trade Organization]] member in December 2005.

=== Development ===
Saudi Arabia is one of the few fastest growing [[country|countries]] in the world with a high [[per capita income]] of $20,700 (2007), Saudi Arabia will be launching six [[economic]] [[city|cities]] ([[King Abdullah Economic City]])<ref>[http://www.sagia.gov.sa/en/business-opportunities/economic-cities Six New Economic cities in Saudi Arabia]</ref> which will be completed by the year 2020. These six new industrialized [[city|cities]] will diversify the economy of Saudi Arabia, and will also increase the per capita income to a high level. The King of Saudi Arabia has announced that the [[per capita income]] is forecast, to rise from $15,000 in 2006 to $33,500 in 2020.<ref>[http://professional.tdctrade.com/content.aspx?data=Professional_content_en&contentid=917452&w_sid=194&w_pid=836&w_nid=10993&w_cid=917452&w_idt=1900-01-01&w_oid=181&w_jid= Construction boom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE]</ref> The [[city|cities]] will be spread around Saudi Arabia to promote diversification for each region and their economy, and the cities will contribute $150 billion to the GDP.

However the [[urban area]]s of [[Riyadh]] and [[Jeddah]] will contribute $287 billion dollars by the year 2020.<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2020.html Riyadh's Urban area will contribute $ 167 B and Jeddah's will contribute $ 111 Billion]</ref>

=== Foreign labour ===
Despite the government's efforts to promote [[Saudization]], the country draws a significant portion of its labour force from foreign countries, especially from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] (notably [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]]), [[East Asia]], [[East Africa]] and from other [[Middle East]]ern countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/saudi0704/saudi0704.pdf |title=Bad Dreams: Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia (PDF)|publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=July 2004 |accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> There are also some people from North America, South America, and Europe. Hundreds of thousands of low-[[skilled worker]]s and skilled workers from regions of the [[developing country|developing world]] migrate to Saudi Arabia, sometimes only for a short period of time, to work. Although exact figures are not known, skilled experts in the [[bank]]ing and services professions seek work in the Kingdom.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Saudi Arabia}}
{{see|Bedouin|Tribes of Arabia}}
[[Image:Saudi-Arabia-demography.png|thumb|250px|Demographics of Saudi Arabia, [[FAO]] data, 2005; Number of inhabitants in thousands]]
Saudi Arabia's population as of July 2006 is estimated to be about 27,019,731, including an estimated 5,576,076 resident foreigners.<ref>http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3584.htm</ref> Until the 1960s, a majority of the population was [[nomad]]ic; but presently more than 95% of the population is settled, due to rapid economic and urban growth. As recently as the 1950s, the Saudi Arabia’s slave population was estimated at 450,000 — 2% of the population.<ref>[http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/slavery.htm Slavery in Islam]</ref><ref>[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/apr07/page18.html £400 for a Slave]</ref> [[Slavery]] was officially abolished in 1962.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2 /> The birth rate is 29.56 births per 1,000 people. The death rate is 2.62 deaths per 1,000 people. Some cities and oases have densities of more than 1,000 people per square kilometer (2,600/sq&nbsp;mi).

About 23% of the population is made up of foreign nationals living in Saudi Arabia.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575422_3/saudi_arabia.html Saudi Arabia]</ref> Approximately 12% of the population is [[South Asia]]n or of South Asian ancestry, including Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis. In addition, there are some citizens of [[Asian people|Asian]], [[Horn of Africa|Northeast African]], and [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] ancestry. Many Arabs from nearby countries are employed in the kingdom. There are over eight million migrants from countries all around the world, (including non-Muslims):<ref name = IRFR>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108492.htm Saudi Arabia: International Religious Freedom Report 2008]</ref> [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian]]: 1.4 million, [[Bangladesh]]i: 1 million, [[Filipino people|Filipino]]: 950,000, [[Pakistan]]i: 900,000, [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]: 900,000, [[Yemen]]i: 800,000, [[Indonesia]]n: 500,000, [[Sri Lanka]]n: 350,000, [[Sudan]]ese: 250,000, [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]]: 100,000 and [[Turkish people|Turkish]]: 80,000.<ref>[http://www.un.org/esa/population/meetings/EGM_Ittmig_Arab/P02_Kapiszewski.pdf Arab versus Asian migrant workers in the GCC countries]</ref> There are around 100,000 [[Western world|Westerners]] in Saudi Arabia, most of whom live in [[Compound (enclosure)|compounds]] or [[Gated community|gated communities]].

Saudi Arabia expelled 800,000 Yemenis in 1990 and 1991 to punish [[Yemen]] for its opposition to the [[Gulf War]] against [[Iraq]]. An estimated 240,000 [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] are living in Saudi Arabia. They are not allowed to hold or even apply for Saudi citizenship, because of [[Arab League]] instructions barring the Arab states from granting them citizenship in order "to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right to return to their homeland."<ref>[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=58980&d=14&m=2&y=2005 Expatriates Can Apply for Saudi Citizenship in Two-to-Three Months]</ref>
Palestinians are the sole foreign group that cannot benefit from a 2004 law passed by Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers, which entitles [[expatriate]]s of all nationalities who have resided in the kingdom for ten years to apply for citizenship, provided that they are Muslim, with priority being given to holders of degrees in various scientific fields.

The majority of the population adheres to a theological interpretation within Islam most commonly known as [[Salafism]] or [[Wahhabism]]. Writing in 2006 for the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] Lionel Beehner estimated the [[demographics of Islam|Shia population]] of the country at 15 percent.<ref>Beehner, Lionel. [http://www.cfr.org/publication/10903/shiite_muslims_in_the_middle_east.html Shia Muslims in the Mideast], ''Council on Foreign Relations'', June 16, 2006. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref> Shia in Saudi Arabia reside primarily in the eastern provinces on the Gulf, southwestern provinces bordering [[Yemen]], Mecca and particularly, Medina, as well as other larger cities in the kingdom.{{fact|date=November 2008}}

The Saudi government does not recognize any religions other than Islam, and does not grant non-Muslims the right to practice their faith. Though the government officially claims to guarantee the right of private worship of non-Muslims, this right is not always respected in practice and is not defined in law<ref>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108492.htm</ref>Comprehensive statistics for the denominations of foreigners are not available, but they include Muslims from the various branches and schools of Islam, [[Christian]]s, [[Hindu]]s, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Jew]]s. An estimated 90 percent of the Filipino community is Christian, and private Christian religious gatherings reportedly take place throughout the country<ref>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108492.htm</ref>.

==Education==
{{main|Education in Saudi Arabia}}
When the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932, [[education]] was not accessible to everyone and limited to individualized instruction at religious schools in mosques in urban areas. These schools taught Islamic law and basic literacy skills. By the end of the century, Saudi Arabia had a nationwide educational system providing free training from preschool through university to all citizens.

The primary education system began in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s. By 1945, King Abdulaziz bin Abdelrahman Al-Saud, the country's founder, had initiated an extensive program to establish schools in the Kingdom. Six years later, in 1951, the country had 226 schools with 29,887 students. In 1954, the Ministry of Education was established, headed by then Prince Fahd bin Abdulaziz as the first Minister of Education. The first university, now known as [[King Saud University]], was founded in Riyadh in 1957.

Today, Saudi Arabia's nationwide public educational system comprises twenty universities, more than 24,000 schools, and a large number of colleges and other educational and training institutions. The system provides students with free education, books and health services and is open to every Saudi. Over 25 percent of the annual State budget is for education including vocational training. The Kingdom has also worked on scholarship programs to send students overseas to the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, [[Malaysia]] and other nations. Currently thousands of students are being sent to higher-educations programs every year.

The study of Islam remains at the core of the Saudi educational system. The Islamic aspect of the Saudi national curriculum is examined in a 2006 report by [[Freedom House]].<ref>{{Citation

|publisher=Freedom House
|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> The Saudi religious studies curriculum is taught outside the Kingdom in [[madrasah]] throughout the world.

== Sports ==

Men can often be found playing sports. Women rarely participate in sports, and always away from the presence of men; this often leads to indoor gyms. Even though [[association football|football]] is the most popular sport, Saudi Arabia has recently participated in the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and in international competitions in [[volleyball]] and other sports. The Saudi Arabian national youth baseball team has also participated in the Little League World Series. The [[Saudi Arabia national football team]] is often most known for being in four consecutive times in the [[FIFA World Cup]] and six times in the [[AFC Asian Cup]], which the team won three times and was runner-up three times. Some popular football players include [[Majed Abdullah]], [[Mohamed Al-Deayea]], [[Sami Al-Jaber]], and [[Saeed Al-Owairan]].

== Culture ==
[[Image:Omm Al Qura ST - Mecca.JPG|thumb|Street view of [[Mecca]]]]
[[Image:Montazah alsalam.jpg|thumb|A recreation park in [[Riyadh]]]]
Saudi Arabian culture mainly revolves around the religion of [[Islam]]. Islam's two holiest sites, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], are located in the country. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. The weekend begins on Thursday due to Friday being the holiest day for Muslims. All Muslim countries have a Thursday-Friday or Friday-Saturday weekend.<ref>Sulaiman, Tosin. [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article697051.ece Bahrain changes the weekend in efficiency drive], ''The Times'', August 2, 2006. Accessed June 25, 2008.</ref> The public practice of any religion other than Islam, including Christianity and Judaism, the presence of churches, and possession of non-Islamic religious materials is not allowed except in Aramco compounds in which many expatriates attend church services.{{fact|date=February 2008}} Saudi Arabia's cultural heritage is celebrated at the annual [[Jenadriyah]] cultural festival.

However, secret negotiations are rumored to be taking place between the Vatican and Saudi Arabia regarding authorization to build Catholic Churches in the Kingdom.<ref>Adnkronos International, March 17, 2008, "[http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=1.0.1982104543 Vatican: Secret talks for churches in Saudi Arabia, says report"]</ref>

=== Music and dance ===
One of Saudi Arabia's most compelling folk rituals is the [[Ardha|Al Ardha]], the country's national dance. This [[sword dance]] is based on ancient [[Bedouin]] traditions: drummers beat out a rhythm and a poet chants verses while sword-carrying men dance shoulder to shoulder. [[Al-sihba]] folk music, from the [[Hejaz]], has its origins in [[al-Andalus]]. In [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jeddah]], dance and song incorporate the sound of the [[mizmar]], an [[oboe]]-like [[woodwind instrument]] in the performance of the [[Mizmar (dance)|mizmar dance]]. The [[drum]] is also an important instrument according to traditional and tribal customs. [[Samri]] is a popular traditional form of music and dance in which poetry is sung.

=== Dress ===
Saudi Arabian dress follows strictly the principles of [[hijab]] (the Islamic principle of [[modesty]], especially in dress). The predominantly loose and flowing but covering garments are helpful in Saudi Arabia's [[desert]] climate. Traditionally, men usually wear an ankle-length shirt woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by a cord coil) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by a cord coil) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. Women's clothes are decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques. Women are required to wear an [[abaya]] or modest clothing when in public. 

=== Food ===
[[Islamic dietary laws]] forbid the eating of [[pork]] and the drinking of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and this law is enforced strictly throughout Saudi Arabia. Arabic unleavened bread, or [[Khubz|khobz]], is eaten with almost all meals. Other staples include [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[Chicken (food)|grilled chicken]], [[falafel]] (deep-fried [[chickpea]] balls), [[shawarma]] (spit-cooked sliced lamb), and [[Ful medames]] (a paste of [[Vicia faba|fava beans]], [[garlic]] and [[lemon]]). Traditional [[coffeehouse]]s used to be ubiquitous, but are now being displaced by food-hall style cafes. Arabic [[tea]] is also a famous custom, which is used in both casual and formal meetings between friends, family and even strangers. The tea is black (without milk) and has herbal flavoring that comes in many variations.

=== Film and theatre ===
[[Theater (structure)|Public theatres]] and [[movie theater|cinemas]] are prohibited, as Wahhabi tradition deems those institutions to be incompatible with Islam. However, an [[IMAX]] theatre is available,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070710151013/http://www.scitech.com.sa/IMAX.html IMAX Arabic]</ref> and in private compounds such as [[Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran|Dhahran]] and [[Ras Tanura]] public theaters can be found, but often are more popular for local music, arts, and theatre productions rather than the exhibition of motion pictures. Recently, plans for some cinemas that will be allowed to feature Arabic cartoons for women and children were announced.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} DVDs, including American and British movies, are legal and widely available.

=== Literature ===
Some Saudi [[novel]]ists have had their books published in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], because of [[censorship]] in Saudi Arabia. Despite signs of increasing openness, Saudi novelists and [[artist]]s in [[film]], [[theatre]], and the [[visual arts]] face greater restrictions on their freedom of expression than in the West. Contemporary Saudi novelists include:
* [[Abdul Rahman Munif]] (exiled, now deceased)
* Yousef Al-Mohaimeed
* Abdu Khal
* [[Turki al-Hamad]] (subject of a [[fatwā]] and death threats)
* Ali al-Domaini (in jail)
* Ahmed Abodehman (now writes in French)
* [[Raja'a Alem]]
* [[Abdullah Al-Qasemi]]
* [[Rajaa al-Sanea|Rajaa Al Sanie]], author of best-selling novel ''[[Girls of Riyadh]]''

=== Religion ===
Due to the legal framework of the country, which does not provide legal protection for freedom of religion, the public practice of non-Muslim religions is prohibited. Indeed, the Government enforces a strict and conservative version of Sunni Islam. Muslims who do not follow the official interpretation, can face severe repercussions at the hands of Mutawwa'in (religious police).

For this reason, Saudi culture lacks the diversity of religious expression, buildings, annual festivals and public events that is seen in countries where religious freedom is permitted.<ref name= IRFR/>

== Military ==

Saudi military was founded as the [[Ikhwan]] army, the tribal army of [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Ibn Saud]]. The Ikhwan had helped King Ibn Saud conquer the Arabian peninsula during the First World War. By expanding the military forces years later, Saudi Arabia today has many military branches.

== Foreign relations ==
{{main|Foreign relations of Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia is one of the largest contributors of [[development aid]], both in term of [[Official development assistance|volume of aid]] and in the ratio of aid volume to [[gross domestic product|GDP]].<ref>[http://saudinf.com/MAIN/l102.htm Saudi Aid to the Developing World]</ref><ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197906/arab.aid-an.introduction.htm Arab Aid]</ref>

Much of Saudi Arabia's aid has gone to poorer Islamic countries or Islamic communities in non-Islamic countries. This aid has contributed to the spreading of Islam of the sort found in Saudi Arabia, rather than fostering the traditions of the receiving ethnic groups. The effect has been the erosion of regional Islamic cultures through standardization. Examples of the acculturizing effect of Saudi aid can be seen among the [[Minangkabau]] and the [[Aceh]]nese in [[Indonesia]], as well as among the people of the [[Maldives]].<ref>Ricklefs, M.C.
