"'''Say It Right'''" is a [[pop music|pop]]-[[R&B]] song written by Canadian singer [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]] and [[Nate Hills|Nate "Danjahandz" Hills]] for Furtado's third album ''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'' (2006). It was co-produced by Timbaland and Danja and released as the album's third [[single (music)|single]] in [[North America]], with its U.S. radio release on [[October 31]] [[2006]] (see [[2006 in music]]).<ref>AllAccess.com</ref> It is the fourth UK single from ''Loose'' and will be released there on [[March 5]] [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.hmv.co.uk/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=282;2;-1;-1&sku=611559]</ref>

==Background==
The process of creating the song began in the recording studio one morning at around 4:00am, when Timbaland recommended that Furtado go home because she was tired. Furtado, who had heard that the band [[U2]] wrote many of their songs in the studio control room, said "Really? I'll show you", put on her [[hoodie]] and began to "[[jam session|jam]]".<ref name="RS">Scaggs, Austin. [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10603268/why_is_nelly_furtados_new_album_so_loud "Why Is Nelly Furtado's New Album So Loud?"]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[June 19]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[December 30]] [[2006]].</ref> Nate Hills and Timbaland soon joined her, writing and producing as they went, and according to Furtado this process intensified as she sang. The team used four microphones in the live room and moved them around during recording, about which Furtado said "...when you listen to it &mdash; there's a lot of dimension. It kind of sounds like [Timbaland]'s in another country".<ref name="RS"/> Afterwards they picked the best vocals and "perfected" them, before inserting "reverbs and weird alien sounds" onto them. "[W]e experimented a lot with depth and different sounds", Furtado said of the making of the song. "[It] affected my vocals a whole lot."<ref name="RS"/>

Furtado has cited the "spooky, [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]]-driven pop sound" of the band [[Eurythmics]], particularly their song "[[Here Comes the Rain Again]]" (1983), as an influence on "Say It Right" and other tracks on ''Loose''. "I'm not 100 percent sure what ["Here Comes the Rain Again"]'s about, but it always takes me away to another place, and I love it", she said.<ref name="umusic">[http://umusic.ca/nellyfurtado/ "Nelly Furtado"]. [[Universal Music]] Canada. Retrieved [[December 30]] [[2006]].</ref> She said that she does not really know what "Say It Right" is about, "but it captures the feeling I had when I wrote it, and it taps into this other sphere."<ref name="umusic"/>

== Music video ==

The [[music video]] for "Say It Right" was directed by [[United Kingdom|British]] duo Rankin & Chris and filmed at various locations in [[Los Angeles, California]] in late October 2006,<ref>[[Nelly Furtado|Furtado, Nelly]]. [http://www.nellyfurtado.com/news/default.aspx/nid/9323 "Nelly at MTV Europe Awards"]. Nellyfurtado.com. [[November 11]], [[2006]]. Retrieved [[December 30]], [[2006]].</ref> shot back-to-back with the video for "[[All Good Things (Come to an End)]]" (the album's third single in Europe). The video debuted on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'' in the U.S. on [[November 6]] and on [[Canada]]'s [[MuchMusic]] in the week ending [[November 16]]. It reached number nine on the ''Total Request Live'' top ten video countdown on [[November 8]], its first day on the countdown;<ref>[http://www.popfusion.net/records/recaparchive/2006_11.html "The TRL Archive - November 2006"]. popfusion.net. Retrieved [[January 1]] [[2007]].</ref> it returned to the countdown on [[December 14]]<ref>[http://www.popfusion.net/records/recaparchive/2006_12.html "The TRL Archive - December 2006"]. popfusion.net. Retrieved [[January 26]] [[2007]].</ref> and peaked at number two on [[January 17]]. The video reached number seven on the MuchMusic series ''[[Countdown (MuchMusic TV series)|Countdown]]'' for the week ending [[January 5]].<ref>[http://top40-charts.com/songs/full.php?sid=18602&sort=chartid "Nelly Furtado - Say It Right"]. top40-charts.com.

The clip starts with a helicopter landing on top of a tall city building, and Furtado getting out. She is shown on the roof of the building throughout the video, which features mostly face shots of her and Timbaland intercut with shots of dancers. Furtado described the clip as "a throwback to the '80s" because the shots of her and Timbaland reminded her much of those of [[Annie Lennox]] and [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] in videos for Eurythmics' singles, and "the strange relationship [they] had, where ... you get this intense vibe from it. And Tim and me, we're partners, we vibe on a serious creative level, so the video captures that energy."<ref name="MTV-Nov2006">Vineyard, Jennifer.
