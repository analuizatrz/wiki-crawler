The '''Wisden Cricketers of the Year''' are [[cricket]]ers selected for the honour by the annual publication ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', based primarily on their "influence on the previous English season."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4415439.stm | title = Wisden tribute to England stars | accessdate = 2008-04-07 | date = 2005-04-06| publisher = [[BBC Sport]]}}</ref>  The award began in 1889 with the naming of "Six Great Bowlers of the Year",<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155996.html | title = Wisden - 1889 |  accessdate = 2008-04-07 | publisher = Cricinfo }}</ref> and continued with the naming of "Nine Great Batsmen of the Year" in 1890 and "Five Great Wicket-Keepers" in 1891.<ref name=wfcoty>{{Cite web | url = http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/current/story/209422.html| title = Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year | accessdate = 2008-04-07 | publisher = Cricinfo }}</ref>   

Since 1897, with a few notable exceptions, the annual award has recognised five players of the year.  No players were named in 1916 or 1917, as the [[First World War]] prevented any [[first-class cricket]] being played in England, while in 1918 and 1919 the recipients were five schoolboy cricketers.<ref name=wfcoty/> From 1941 to 1946, the [[Second World War]] caused the same issue and no players were named. Three players have been sole recipients:  [[W. G. Grace]] (1896),  [[Plum Warner]] (1921) and [[Jack Hobbs]] (1926).  The latter two selections are the only exceptions to the rule that a player may receive the award only once.  Hobbs was first recognised in 1909, but was selected a second time in 1926 to honour his breaking W. G. Grace's record of 126 first-class hundreds;<ref name=record>{{Cite web | url = http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153105.html | title = The first century, 1989 - Wisden's cricketers of the year| author = Anthony Bradbury | accessdate = 2008-04-17 | publisher = Cricinfo}}</ref>  Warner was first honoured in 1904, but received a second award in 1921 for his last season in first-class cricket, when he led [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] to a [[County Championship]] win.<ref name=record/>  [[John Wisden]], cricketer and eponymous founder of the almanack, was featured in a special commemorative section in the Jubilee edition of the publication in 1913, 29 years posthumously.<ref name=wisden>{{Cite web | url = http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228419.html | title = Cricketers of the Year | author = A. S. Dixon | publisher = Cricinfo | accessdate=2008-04-07}} "Also I have left out of my reckoning John Wisden, founder of the Almanack, to whose memory the whole feature was devoted in the Jubilee issue of 1913--he died in 1884." As such, he is not a true Cricketer of the Year, but is included here for the sake of comprehensiveness.</ref>

From 2000 to 2003 the award was made based on players' impact on cricket worldwide rather than just the preceding season in England,<ref name=wfcoty/> but the decision was reversed in 2004 with the introduction of a separate [[Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World]] award.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/current/story/243912.html | title = 20 things you never knew about Wisden | accessdate = 2008-04-07 | publisher = Cricinfo }}</ref>

The earliest surviving recipient of the award is [[Alec Bedser]] (1947), which he became in March 2008 with the death of [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] (1939).  The longest that a recipient has lived after receiving the award is 77 years by [[Harry Calder]] (1918), who died in 1995.  Calder, however, uniquely for a recipient, played no first-class cricket.  Among first-class players, the longest lived after receipt of the award is 74 years by [[Wilfred Rhodes]] (1899).
