'''Deborah Ann Harry''' (born [[July 1]], [[1945]], in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]) is an American [[rock and roll]] musician from [[New Jersey]]. She originally gained fame as the frontwoman for the [[New Wave music|new wave]] band [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]. Following this success, she went on to develop careers as a solo musician and an actress.  

== Life and career ==
Harry was [[adopted]] at three months of age by a family from [[Hawthorne, New Jersey]] and attended [[Hawthorne High School (New Jersey)|Hawthorne High School]]. Prior to starting her singing career she moved to New York in the late 60's and worked as a secretary at the BBC Radio New York office for one year. Later, she was a waitress, a dancer in [[Union City, New Jersey|Union City]], and a [[Playboy Bunny]].<ref>{{cite news

She began her musical career with the folk rock group, The Wind In The Willows. Harry then joined a girl-group trio, The Stilettos, in the early 1970s. The Stilettos' backup band included her eventual boyfriend and Blondie guitarist, [[Chris Stein]]. Harry and Stein formed the band Blondie in the mid 1970s, naming it after the [[street harassment|catcall]]s men would give Harry while passing by in their cars. Blondie quickly became regulars at [[Max's Kansas City]] and [[CBGB's]] in [[New York City]]. After a debut album in 1976, commercial success followed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, first in Australia and Europe, then in the United States. 

With her two-tone bottle-blonde hair, Debbie Harry quickly became a recognizable icon of punk style. Her look was further popularized by the band's early presence in the music video revolution of the era. The clip for "[[Rapture (song)|Rapture]]" appeared within the first 24 hours of [[MTV]]'s launch. Harry's strong stage persona of cool sexuality and streetwise style became so closely associated with the group's name that many came to believe the singer's name to be "Blondie", to her lasting chagrin.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} To complicate matters further, Harry has sometimes described "Blondie" as being the character she plays onstage with the band as well as the band's name.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The difference between the individual Harry and the band Blondie was famously highlighted with a "Blondie is a Group" button campaign by the band in 1979<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rip-her-to-shreds.com/archive_press_magazines_rm28april79.php|title=More Males Per Oxide|publisher=[[Record Mirror]] (mirrored at Blondie fansite)|date=[[April 28]] [[1979]]|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>.

Harry began her solo career with the album ''[[Koo Koo]]'' in [[1981]] (see [[1981 in music]]). In April [[1983]], she appeared on Broadway with [[Andy Kaufman]] in the wrestling play ''[[Teaneck Tanzi]]'' (originally called ''Trafford Tanzi''), which opened and closed in one night. She also teamed up with [[Giorgio Moroder]] that year on the song "Rush Rush", which was featured in the film ''[[Scarface]]''. From 1983 through 1986, Harry minimized her public life in order to care for Chris Stein, who had fallen ill with the rare genetic disease [[pemphigus]]. Her single ''[[Feel the Spin]]'', produced by [[John "Jellybean" Benitez]], was released in [[1985]]. Stein fully recovered and continues a musical relationship with Harry, but their romantic relationship ended in 1987. In 1986 Debbie released her second solo album "Rockbird" and the single "French Kissin' in the USA" brought her into the UK top 10 singles chart. Other singles followed but failed to crack the top forty. Her last solo album ''[[Debravation]]'' (1993) flopped and she was dropped by her record label shortly after.

Starting with the solo album ''[[Def, Dumb and Blonde]]'' in [[1989]], Harry started using "Deborah Harry" as her professional name. On [[February 23]] [[1999]], at the age of 53, Harry became the oldest female singer to reach No. 1 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with [[Maria (Blondie song)|Maria]], (Blondie's first single from the album ''[[No Exit (Blondie album)|No Exit]]''), a record she still holds.

Harry currently resides in New York City.  

=== Acting roles ===
Some of Harry's notable film roles are appearances in ''[[Videodrome]]'' ([[1983]]); ''[[Union City]]'' ([[1980]]); ''[[New York Beat]]'' (otherwise known as ''[[Downtown '81]]'', in which she plays the angel of the East Village alongside [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]); ''[[Rock & Rule]]'' ([[1983]]), an animated movie where she did vocals opposite [[Robin Zander]] of [[Cheap Trick]]; [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' ''[[Hairspray]]'' ([[1988]]), in which she played the big-haired and villainous Velma von Tussle, paired with [[Sonny Bono]] as her husband; and ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100740/ Tales from the Darkside: The Movie]'' ([[1990]]). She also had notable roles in such films as ''[[Spun]]'', ''[[Cop Land]]'','' [[Heavy]]'' and ''[[My Life Without Me]]'', and is featured in David Munro's upcoming feature film ''[[Full Grown Men]]''.

Her TV guest appearances include ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',  ''[[Will & Grace]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (as a musical guest and a host) and ''[[Wiseguy]]''.

She had a voice role in the video game, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', as a cab dispatcher, and sang "[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]" over the closing credits of [[Alex Cox]]'s film ''[[Three Businessmen]]''.

She played the role of "Elizabeth" in the [[Full motion video|FMV]]-based game [[Double Switch]], which was released for the [[Sega CD]] ([[1993]]), the [[Sega Saturn]], [[Apple Macintosh]], and [[Windows 95]].

=== Solo career ===
Deborah Harry has released four original solo albums. She has also performed and released albums with the avant-garde jazz group, the [[Jazz Passengers]] and did many one-off projects with such diverse artists as [[Iggy Pop]], [[Blow-Up]], and [[Die Haut]].

In [[1995]], she recorded two songs with [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[ska]] band [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]], most notably the [[Lennon-McCartney]] song "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]."

In May [[2006]], she released a tribute song to rapper [[Lil' Kim]] called "Dirty and Deep," voicing Harry's opinion that the verdict was marred by conspiracy and lying to the grand jury. The song is available for free from the [http://www.deborahharry.com Deborah Harry Home Page].

Harry has also recorded the song "New York, New York" with [[Moby]], a new track to be included on ''[[Go: The Very Best of Moby]]'', which was released as the album's first single on October 30, 2006. [http://www.go-moby.net/]

The video for the track "New York, New York" can be viewed online as [http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/?id=817e1ea4-e9cc-4be5-8f36-68347cf5621b&delivery=stream Windows Media] or [http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/?id=ae754b37-a154-486f-9678-76490a4de974&delivery=stream Real Media] video streams.

It has been reported that [[SuperBuddha]] will produce Harry's new solo album, due for release some time in 2007. This will be her first solo album since ''[[Debravation]]'' in 1993.

==Trivia==
*Harry entered the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Book of Records]] in 1999 as the "Oldest Female Singer to Reach No. 1 in the UK Chart." This happened when she went to number one with "[[Maria (Blondie song)|Maria]]" on February 13, 1999 at the age of 53 years and 227 days.<ref> [[Guinness World Records|2004 Guinness World Book of Records]] (paper) (in English), p. 18. ISBN 0-85112-180-2. "Humans" chapter.</ref>

*As of 2006, she is one of the faces of MAC Cosmetics' Viva Glam VI campaign.  The campaign donates every cent of the selling price of their iconic lipstick shades to the MAC AIDS Fund, which helps people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide.
