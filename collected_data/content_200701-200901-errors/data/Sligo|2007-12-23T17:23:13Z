'''Sligo''' ({{Irish place name|Sligeach|Shelly place}}) ({{pronEng|ˈslaɪɡoʊ}} "sly-go", [[Irish language|Irish]] {{IPA2|ˈɕlʲɪɟəx}}), is the [[county town]] of [[County Sligo]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The town is a [[borough]] and has a [[charter]] and a town [[mayor]]. It is the second largest urban area in [[Connacht]] (after [[Galway]])<ref>Western Development Commission website http://www.wdc.ie/countyprofiles_sligo.html</ref>. Sligo's population dropped at the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|2006 census]]<ref name=cso/> to a little under 18,000 inhabitants. It is home to the [[Sligo Institute of Technology]].

==History==
Sligo's Irish name "Sligeach" - meaning shelly place - originates in the abundance of [[shellfish]] found in the river and its estuary, and from the extensive '[[midden#Shell middens|shell middens]]' or Stone Age food preparation areas in the vicinity.<ref name=FandF>{{cite book |last=Flanagan and Flanagan |first=Deirdre and Laurence |title=Irish Place Names |year=1994 |publisher=Gill & MacMillan |isbn=0-7171-2066-X |quote=Flanagan & Flanagan suggest ''abounding in shells'' as the meaning of Sligeach}}</ref> <ref name=SBC>The [http://www.sligoborough.ie/asp/AboutUs/HistorySligo.asp Sligo Borough Council web site] says ''Shelly place''.</ref> The river (now known as the Garavogue) was originally also called the Sligeach.<ref name=ILNE>

</ref> The [[Ordnance Survey]] letters of [[1836]] state that "cart loads of shells were found underground in many places within the town where houses now stand". At that time shells were constantly being dug up during the construction of foundations for buildings. This whole area, from the river estuary at Sligo, around the coast to the river at [[Ballysadare]] Bay, was rich in marine resources which were utilised as far back as the [[Mesolithic]] period.

Sligo town's first roundabout was constructed around a megalithic tomb (Abbeyquarter North, in Garavogue Villas <ref> Landscape of the monuments. A study of the passage tombs in the Cúil Irra region, Co. Sligo, Ireland: Stefan Bergh, 1995. Stockholm: Riksantikvarieämbetet Arkeologiska Undersökningar</ref>).

In the medieval period Sligo was an important crossroads strategically and commercially.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} [[Sligo Abbey]], the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary, is the only medieval building left standing in the town. It was founded by the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, [[Maurice Fitzgerald]] in 1253 but accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was rebuilt in its present form. When Frederick Hamilton’s soldiers sacked Sligo Town in 1642, the Abbey was burned and everything valuable in it was destroyed. Much of the structure, including the choir, carved altar and cloisters remain.

Between 1847 and 1851 over 30,000 people emigrated through the [[port]] of Sligo.<ref>Lord Palmerston and the Irish Famine Emigration: A Rejoinder,  Desmond Norton, Cambridge University Press, The Historical Journal (2003),  46: 155-165 </ref> On the Quays, overlooking the [[River Garavogue|Garavogue]] River, is a memorial sculpture to those people. This is one of a suite of three sculptures commissioned by the Sligo Famine Commemoration Committee to honour the victims of the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|Great Famine]]. A plaque in the background, headed 'Letter to America, January 2, 1850' tells one family's sad story: "''I am now, I may say, alone in the world. All my brothers and sisters are dead and children but yourself... We are all ejected out of Mr. Enright's ground... The times was so bad and all [[Ireland]] in such a state of poverty that no person could pay rent. My only hope now rests with you, as I am without one shilling and as I said before I must either beg or go to the poorhouse... I remain your affectionate father, Owen Larkin. Be sure answer this by return of post.''"

The poet [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] is associated with Sligo. Much of his writing is descriptive of the area around Sligo town. In particular "[[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]]" is a reference to a small, uninhabited island on [[Lough Gill]], which is a lake adjacent to the town. (The poet was likely thinking of Beezies Island, a bigger island in the lake close to the mouth of the Garavogue and a popular place to row to in the nineteen hundreds.) Yeats, who spent much of his youth in Sligo and its environs, died in 1939 and is buried in the graveyard in [[Drumcliffe]], County Sligo<ref>http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Yeats_Grave_Drumcliffe_Sligo.jpg</ref>.

Sligo town is encircled by two mountain ranges, namely [[Dartry Mountains]] to the north and the [[Ox Mountains]] to the south. The Dartry range includes the famous [[Benbulbin]] which W. B. Yeats often wrote about and is said to be the resting place of [[Diarmuid]] and [[Grainne]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  

Sligo town recently highlighted its connections with famous [[Goon Show]] star and writer [[Spike Milligan]] by unveiling a plaque at the former Milligan family home at Number 5 Holborn Street.<ref>Spike_Milligan.

==Transport==
[[Image:Border diagram 2007.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Sligo Hub & Gateway access]]
The primary arteries of Sligo's road network are the "Inner-Relief Road" dual-carriageway, part of the [[N4 road]] to Dublin (which is motorway on some stretches, dual-carriageway in others). The section of the N4 road between Sligo and Collooney, about 15 kilometers outside Sligo is made up of dual carriageway which was completed in around the Millenium, bypassing The towns Of Collooney and Ballisodare. An extension onto this road was completed in 2005. This is The Sligo Inner Relief Road. It stretches from Carraroe in the south of Sligo to the outside of Sligo town. The Sligo County Council ‘Traffic & Transportation Plan’ identified the pedestrianisation of Sligo’s core streets as a priority following the opening of the Sligo Inner Relief Road, and O'Connell Street, the main street in the town has been pedestrianised as of 15th August 2006.

Sligo acquired rail links to [[Dublin]] in 1862, with the opening of the [[Sligo Mac Diarmada Station|Sligo railway station]] on [[3 December]] of that year<ref>{{cite web | title= Sligo station| work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref>. Connections to [[Enniskillen]] and the north followed in [[1881]] and [[Limerick]] and the south in [[1895]]. The line to Enniskillen closed in [[1957]] and passenger services to Galway/Limerick closed in [[1963]]. For many years [[Córas Iompair Éireann|CIE]] kept the latter line open for freight traffic, and although it is now disused, it forms part of the [[Western Rail Corridor]] redevelopment project. In [[1966]] Sligo railway station was renamed [[Sligo Mac Diarmada Station|Mac Diarmada Station]] after Irish rebel [[Seán Mac Diarmada]] from [[County Leitrim]]<ref name=MacD>

Sligo Town and County Sligo are served by [[Sligo Airport]], 8 kilometres (5 miles) from Sligo town and close to [[Strandhill]] village, served by [[Aer Arann]], which operates flights to Dublin and to Manchester in the [[United Kingdom]].

Sligo port handles relatively small ships up to 2,000 [[deadweight|dwt]].<ref name=SEA>{{cite web | title = A Profile of County Sligo | url = http://www.sligoenterprise.ie/sligo_county_profile.html#sea | publisher = Sligo County Enterprise Board| accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref>

== Development ==
[[Image:Sligo Borough Council.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sligo Borough Council]]

Like many urban areas in western areas of Ireland, Sligo suffered for many years from the lack of development.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} However this has improved in some sectors in the past decade, particularly with the opening of two new shopping centres in 2005 (Quayside) and 2007 (Johnston's Court).

Some new development has occurred along the river Garavogue, most notably the regeneration of J.F.K. (Kennedy) Parade, Kempton Promenade, and Rockwood Parade, consisting of houses, bars and a number of apartments as well two new footbridges over the river itself. The most recent addition to the riverside is the new Glasshouse Hotel, a 7-Story, glass building overlooking the River Garavogue and Rockwood Parade. At the far end of the Glasshouse Hotel, an apartment complex named Swan Point is currently under construction.
