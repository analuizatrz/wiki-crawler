'''''The Chaser's War on Everything''''' is a satirical television comedy series broadcast on [[ABC TV]] in [[Australia]]. The series is produced by the Australian satire group ''[[The Chaser]]'' consisting of [[Chris Taylor (comedian)|Chris Taylor]], [[Julian Morrow]], [[Craig Reucassel]], [[Andrew Hansen]] and [[Chas Licciardello]]. Fellow Chaser members [[Dominic Knight]] and [[Charles Firth]] are not part of the regular on-screen cast. Knight is however a writer for the show, and Firth did roving reports for the show from the [[United States]], until he left the group to start his own satirical newspaper in mid-2007.

The show has run since February [[2006]] and as of [[24 October]] [[2007]], has currently broadcast 47 episodes over two seasons. The program is currently airing the second half of the second season, which premiered on [[September 5]] [[2007]] at the now usual time of {{nowrap|9 pm}}, Wednesday on the main ABC TV channel. For the first season the show was broadcast at an unstable timeslot on Friday nights, for all 26 episodes.

The program and The Chaser group has often attracted controversy because of the stunts displayed on the show. On [[14 July]] [[2006]], Licciardello was charged after a stunt concerning [[rugby league]] team the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]].  Licciardello was again charged, alongside Morrow and nine crew members, on [[6 September]] [[2007]] after breaching security at [[APEC]].

==Origins==
[[Image:TheChaser-FullTeam.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The entire team of The Chaser on ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' on [[July 14]], [[2006]].]]
[[The Chaser]] were originally formed by [[Dominic Knight]], [[Charles Firth]], [[Craig Reucassel]] and [[Julian Morrow]], and in 1999 they ran a fortnightly newspaper entitled [[The Chaser (newspaper)|The Chaser]]. Since then they were joined by [[Chas Licciardello]], [[Andrew Hansen]] and [[Chris Taylor]], who helped them with the satirical newspaper. Through the help of [[Andrew Denton]], an [[ABC TV|ABC]] personality, the Chaser team produced various shows for the ABC: most notably [[CNNNN]]. In 2005, they began filming a pilot for a new television series for the ABC, with the working title ''The Age of Terror Variety Hour''.<ref name="gibberish">{{cite news|publisher=The Age|title=Dinner, Piers pressure and lots of red whine|last=Lawson|first=Annie|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/creative--media/dinner-piers-pressure-and-lots-of-red-whine/2005/07/24/1122143723586.html?from=moreStories|date=[[2005-07-25]]|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> The Chaser team signed with the ABC, 27 half hour episodes for 2006, which would be based on news reviews, studio monologues and confrontations with politicians, celebrities and business leaders.<ref name="rejectnames"/> The show was to be presented by Morrow, Hansen, Reucassel, Taylor and Licciardello.<ref name="gibberish"/> 

The ABC rejected the name ''The Age of Terror Variety Hour'' and other names including ''Thank Allah It's Friday''. While the names ''The Chaser is Right'' and ''Hey Hey, it's the Chaser'' were accepted, the Chaser filmed a pilot of ''The War'' under the ''Hey Hey, it's The Chaser'' title in [[2005]],<ref name="pilot">[http://www.monkeyhouse.tv/bradleyhowardCV.html Bradley J Howard CV] Retrieved on [[October 25]], [[2007]]</ref> but the Chaser team didn't like the name and therefore eventually selected ''The Chaser's War on Everything''. The show was to be performed in front of a live audience, in a more relaxed format compared with CNNNN and other Chaser productions.<ref name="rejectnames">{{cite news| last=Molitorisz| first=Sacha| title=Behind enemy lines| newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]| year=2006| date=[[2006-02-14]]| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/behind-enemy-lines/2006/02/11/1139542439715.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1}}</ref>

==Release and popularity==
===Broadcast===
The first season of ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' premiered on ABC TV in [[Australia]] on [[February 17]], [[2006]] at the time of {{nowrap|11 pm}}. The series aired late on Friday evenings where it developed a cult following, getting between 591,000 and 821,000 viewers each episode.<ref name="primetime">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/pranksters-slated-for-prime-time/2007/01/27/1169788741631.html|title=ABC pranksters slated for prime time|date=[[2007-01-28]]|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> 

Due to its popularity, the ABC moved it to the timeslot of Wednesdays at 9&nbsp;p.m. ([[Australian Eastern Standard Time|AEST]]) for Season Two.<ref name="primetime"/> In the lead up to the second season, The Chaser team produced a live [[webcast]] of people counting down to the first episode of the season. New segments have also been developed and the opening sequence was reworked. The move to a prime time position ultimately resulted in an increase in the show's ratings, despite being in direct competition with high performing shows on commercial networks, with ratings close to 1.5 millions viewers each week.<ref name="ratings1">{{cite web|url =http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=24&ContentID=30210|title = ABC's Specks and Chasers rating well|publisher = West Australian Newspapers Limited|accessdate = 2007-06-04|date = [[May 31]], [[2007]]}}</ref><ref name="ratings2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/commercial-tv-chases-lost-ratings-230507.html|title= Commercial TV chases lost ratings|date=2007-05-23|publisher= eNews}}</ref>

Due to the popularity of ''The Chaser'' rising, largely due to the controversy of the APEC motorcade stunt, many international countries currently broadcast the show. Countries which broadcast the show include [[Finland]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and [[South Korea]]. Twenty other countries are already in negotiations with [[ABC TV]] to air the series including [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]],  [[Poland]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]]. Political content featuring the country of broadcast could be edited out of the broadcasts in their respective countries.<ref name="international">{{cite web|url =http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22664291-29277,00.html|title = The Chaser goes global|publisher = news.com.au ([[News Limited]])|accessdate = 2007-10-30|date = [[October 28]], [[2007]]}}</ref>

==Segments==
===Primary segments===
The primary segments form the backbone of the show. These segments normally focus on key issues in a range of topics. They are normally presented by the cast members, live in front of the audience, and can be accompanied with pre-produced stunts and sketches relating to the topics. 

* '''Introduction''' – Each episode begins with Reucassel and Taylor opening the show. The pair discuss the major events of the past week, present their opinions, and show a pre-produced stunt or sketch. On some occasions, other cast members may join them. Technically, the introduction is not a specific segment, however it features prominently in every episode.

* '''"What Have We Learnt from [[Current affairs (news format)|Current Affairs]] This Week?"''' – Presented by Hansen and Licciardello, the segment pokes fun at competing weeknight current affair programs ''[[Today Tonight]]'' and ''[[A Current Affair (Australia)|A Current Affair]]''. All segments feature a lesson on their reporting techniques, such as how to spot 'dodgy' guys, how to identify the different types of experts, and the art of network cross-promotion. Both shows are regularly criticised for their tendency to come to fast and inaccurate conclusions. The tallyboard, featured in Season One, of the different types of stories presented, such as "Menaces To Society", has been all but abandoned in Season Two.
[[Image:Chaser members doing ad road test.jpg‎|thumb|250px|right|Chaser member Chas Licciardello along with Chris Taylor (right) and ABC crew, doing an Ad Road-Test on Godfrey's vacuum cleaners.]]
* '''"Firth in the USA"''' – Firth, now living in the [[United States]], performs a stunt or conducts an interview, with obvious references to USA culture. Stunt examples include attempting to enter [[Yale University]]'s '[[Skull and Bones]]' [[secret society]] and meeting [[Hillary Clinton]] to offer his services as her presidential [[intern]]; an obvious satire of  the [[Lewinsky scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/articles/2007/04/12/1175971220516.html|title=Chaser stunt turns heads in US|publisher=Brisbane Times|date=[[12 April]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref> This segment has been less prominent in the second season.

* '''"The Ad Road-Test"''' – The team recreate situations shown in [[television advertisements]] to see if they would work in real life. Examples include whether [[vacuum cleaner]]s can really lift up [[bowling balls]] ([[Godfrey's]]), whether dancing can earn a job ([[Carlton Draught]]), and that male cheerleaders can convince a random person to stop smoking ([[Nicorette]]<ref name="ad">{{cite web|url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/stay-in-touch/no-matter-how-well-you-plan-theres-always-a-flea/2006/05/18/1147545454544.html?page=2|title= No matter how well you plan, there's always a flea|date=2006-05-19|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>).

* '''"In Other News ..."''' – A former segment, presented by Morrow and Reucassel, which focused on current news stories and events, and sometimes showed a pre-produced stunt related to the news item. This was the only segment to appear in every episode of Season One.

* '''Conclusion''' – To end each episode the whole team gathers together, with one of the group members saying the closing joke. Similar to the Introduction, this is not a specific segment.

The following segments were introduced in Season Two.

* '''"The Fixers"''' – Seeming to replace "In Other News ..." for the second season, Morrow and Reucassel examine problems in the community, and present their idea for a fix. This is usually accompanied by a pre-produced item.

=== Supporting segments ===
The supporting segments are usually pre-produced stunts and sketches, supplementing the primary segments of the show. They are generally much shorter in length.

* '''"Surprise Spruiker"''' – Hansen plays a shop "[[spruiker]]" attempts to help various institutions having trouble selling a particular item or idea. Examples include [[Giorgio Armani]] suits, [[WorkChoices]] (outside their government offices), and [[Dell]] laptops, satirising the [[Dell#Defective batteries|battery controversy]]. The stunt usually concludes when he is ordered by security guards to switch off his speakers.

* '''"Scenes from the Life of the Crazy Warehouse Guy"''' – Hansen plays a stereotypical announcer from a [[warehouse]] [[television advertisement]] uses his unique speaking style in everyday situations, such as ordering [[McDonald's]], asking for help in a public library or talking on a mobile phone in public transport. Hansen originally performed the character that would become the Crazy Warehouse Guy in parodies of frantic rug warehouse commercials.

* '''"Pursuit Trivia"''' – Morrow tests the general knowledge of a politician or celebrity by asking a [[Trivial Pursuit]] question from a game card in his hand at an [[interview]] or [[press conference]]. Prominent in the first season though not in the second.

* '''"Mr Ten Questions"''' – Hansen poses for a journalist at a press conference and, when prompted, proceeds to ask ten questions (which vary in degrees of relevance) without letting the interviewee speak until he has read out all ten. Questions can relate to the subject or be completely obscure. So far [[Anthony LaPaglia]] and [[Kerri-Anne Kennerley]] are the only people who have serioiusly attempted to answer all the questions.

* '''"A Message From Osama Bin Laden"''' – An existing video of the infamous terrorist [[Osama Bin Laden]] is subbed with incorrect and humorous [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], often declaring a [[Jihad]] on various people for arbitrary irritations.  Videos of [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] and Kevin Rudd ([[APEC Australia 2007|APEC]] [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese]] speech) have also been used in a similar manner.

* '''"Citizens' Infringement Officer"''' – Morrow acts as an officer who hands out fake fines on behalf of general citizens. Reasons for fines are often very unusual, such as fines to parking inspectors, people with "wanker" [[Vehicle registration plate|number plates]], bad [[mobile phone]] [[ringtone]]s, parents with inappropriate babies' names, riding on the wrong side of an escalator or wearing any kind of apparel on a nudist beach.

The following segments were introduced in Season Two.

* '''"If Life Were A Musical"''' – Members of the cast go to the public, targeting a specific person with a problem, and behave as though they are in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-esque musical. The segment is referred to as a "Taylor Hansen Morrow" production, a spoof of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].

* '''"Clive The Slightly-Too-Loud Commuter"''' – Hansen plays Clive who goes onto [[public transport]] and begins to talk loudly on his [[mobile phone]] about very personal or taboo issues, such as [[Illegal drug trade|drugs]] or [[Sex organ|genital]] health.

=== Occasional segments ===
These segments support the show, however do not feature prominently.

* '''"What Have We Learnt From History?"''' – In this segment Hansen, Taylor and Reucassel test whether people today have learnt a lesson from events in the past; for example the invasion of the [[Trojan Horse]] and the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German Invasion of Poland]] in [[World War II]].

* '''"Famous Face Off"''' – A former segment, presented by Hansen, in which two "masters" in a particular field competed to be the best in an endeavour such as tongue-twisting newsreading or "[[goalkeeper|blocking]]" reforms in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]].

* '''"The 2:30 Report"''' – A former segment, presented by Licciardello and Morrow, which reviewed the worst of late-night television, including late night game shows such as [[Quizmania (Australia)|Quizmania]], and [[Christian]] programming.

The following segments were introduced in Season Two.

* '''"The News According To Fox"''' – Licciardello and Hansen criticise the bias of the popular American [[Fox News Channel]].

* '''"What You Missed on Cable"''' – Presented by Licciardello and Morrow, this segment highlights the oddities on [[Pay television|cable TV]] programs, and compare them to the bland programming on the [[ABC TV|ABC]]. On the DVD commentary, Licciardello points out that it is intended to replace the 2:30 Report from Season One.

* '''"Anna Coren's Segue/Meaningless Gibberish of the Week"''' – Integrated into '''"What Have We Learnt from Current Affairs This Week?"''', this segment looks at either [[Anna Coren|Coren]]'s extremely complicated transitions between unrelated stories, or the strange and meaningless introductions she says on ''[[Today Tonight]]''.

* '''"Nut Job of the Week"''' – Licciardello and Taylor take a look at the "special people in our society"; people who have "alternative views". For example, [[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]'s theory on how to acquire your deepest desires by the [[Law of Attraction]] was examined.

* '''"Open Mic"''' – A segment, derived from a stunt from the first half of the second series, where Morrow goes to various businesses and uses their [[Public address|Public Address Systems]] to make humorous community announcements.

* '''"Election Watch"''' – Presented by Licciardello and Taylor, this segment looks at the parties' various approaches to specific issues related to the upcoming [[Australian federal election, 2007|Federal Election]].

== Controversies and well known stunts==
=== Julian Morrow's novelty cheque ===
On [[February 8]] [[2006]], before the first episode of the show had screened, Morrow approached [[Australian Wheat Board]] executive Charles Stott with a fake novelty cheque, made out to [[Saddam Hussein]], and asked Stott to sign it.  Stott's lawyer said his client felt intimidated by the stunt, and the footage of the stunt was not shown in the first episode as scheduled due to "legal reasons". In the first episode to go to air, Morrow responded by raising the point that Charles Stott has done business with Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator, yet he is intimidated by a large novelty cheque. The footage of this stunt does appear as a bonus on the show's first DVD.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1565449.htm|title=AWB inquiry not laughing over 'The Chaser' stunt|date=[[2006-02-08]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>

=== Chris Taylor on Sunrise ===
[[Image:Taylorsunrise.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Chris Taylor on Sunrise]]
On the ninth episode of the show, Taylor announced that he planned to break-up with his partner of seven years, but he didn't want to ask her "the usual boring way", but do "something special, something she'll remember". The segment shows several of Taylor's attempts to "pop the question", including hanging a sign over a freeway, and "proposing" on a big screen at an outdoor festival. For the finale, Taylor introduces the interview of him on the morning television program, ''[[Sunrise (TV program)|Sunrise]]''. In the interview, Taylor asks the host if he can send a quick message to his partner, he then proceeds to tell her to "get the fuck out of my life". This finale from the segment was leaked onto the internet and has been widely distributed by email. Many viewers believed the segment was actually real but Taylor admitted on national radio station [[Triple J]] that it was set up. It was actually filmed after ''Sunrise'' went to air, with Channel Seven editing on screen graphics for realism.  The hosts of Sunrise admitted it was a set up. However, they did not know what Taylor was going to say because he only asked if he could do a bit for the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/chasing-down-the-powerful/2007/03/20/1174153069543.html?page=5|title=Chasing down the powerful|publisher=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2007-10-15|work=Debi Enker|date=[[March 22]] [[2007]]|quote=May: Chris Taylor appears on Seven's Sunrise and plays nice until the end of the segment when he asks to send a special message to his partner of seven years: "Get the f--- out of my life!" he bellows on live television.}}</ref>

=== Chas Licciardello's Bulldogs incident ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Chascage.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Chas Licciardello following the incident.]] -->
On [[July 14]] [[2006]], Licciardello was charged with offensive conduct after attempting to sell fake [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] merchandise outside an [[National Rugby League|NRL]] game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,19796246-26619,00.html|title=ABC to probe Chaser prank|publisher=[[News Limited]]|date=[[2006-07-15]]}}</ref> The merchandise included plastic [[knuckledusters]] and [[balaclava]]s in the Bulldogs' colours, and was supposed to satirise the anti-social and hooligan behaviour of some Bulldogs fans. Several Bulldogs fans took offense and as a result he was charged for offensive behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/chaser-canterbury-joke-gets-no-laughs/2006/07/15/1152637916434.html|title=Chaser Canterbury joke gets no laughs|date=[[2006-07-16]]|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> On the broadcast following his arrest, Licciardello appeared onstage in handcuffs and within an iron cage. On that same episode, he apologised for his actions, claiming to understand why the Bulldogs fans were offended: because Canterbury Bulldogs fans much prefer to use their fists. This statement was accompanied by footage of Bulldog's supporters assaulting opposing team supporters during a match. After appearing in court with Morrow, Licciardello pleaded not guilty and the matter was adjourned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chaser-star-pleads-not-guilty/2006/08/29/1156617314466.html|title=Chaser star pleads not guilty|date=[[2006-07-16]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref> On [[January 23]], [[2007]], Licciardello was found [[not guilty]] of the offensive behaviour charge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1831871.htm|title=Chaser star cleared over Bulldogs stunt|date=[[2007-01-23]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> He was interviewed after the case draped in an [[Australian flag]], and said he would appeal "to the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]], to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], to the [[UN]], to the [[Jedi Council]] and the [[Snickometer]]."

=== Craig Reucassel's axe stunt ===
On [[2 August]] [[2006]], Reucassel responded to a news story about a private school student who had hugged Prime Minister [[John Howard]] while holding a [[screwdriver]] during one of the PM's morning walks.  To test the Prime Minister's security arrangements, he approached John Howard during a morning walk and asked for a hug while holding a large plastic [[battle axe]].  Reucassel did receive the hug, but a later approach while holding a running [[chainsaw]] was not so successful.  There was much debate surrounding whether or not to turn on the chainsaw and whether they would be shot at for doing this.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newstext.com.au/pages/v.asp?doc=TAM%2D20070317%2D1%2D001%2DK306700%40NAT%2DNEWS%2D2008%2D2007&k2docdate=17/03/2007&querytext=%28Chaser%5C%27s+war+on+comedy%29+%3CAND%3E+%28%28SDate%3E%3D02%2F20%2F2007%29%29&Auth=0&site=ALL&Pick=ONE&dtype=4&f=1&WF=%2Fsupport%2Fdb%2Easp%3Fdoc%3DTAM%252D20070317%252D1%252D001%252DK306700%2540NAT%252DNEWS%252D2008%252D2007%26k2docdate%3D17%2F03%2F2007%26querytext%3D%2528Chaser%255C%2527s%2Bwar%2Bon%2Bcomedy%2529%2B%253CAND%253E%2B%2528%2528SDate%253E%253D02%252F20%252F2007%2529%2529%26Auth%3D0%26v%3D1%26site%3DALL%26Pick%3DONE

=== Julian Morrow's ticket prank ===
On [[16 August]] [[2006]], Morrow purchased two airline tickets on the [[Virgin Blue]] airline under the names "[[Al-Qaeda|Al Kyder]]" and "[[Terrorist|Terry Wrist]]", checked in using the automated check-in at [[Sydney Airport]], and then did not show up for boarding, so that the names would be read out in a final boarding call over the public address system. The prank was acknowledged by Virgin Blue who criticised the use of taxpayer dollars in the "childish humour".<ref name="virginblue">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/a-stunt-too-far/2006/08/18/1155407999231.html|title=Al Kyder: Virgin on the ridiculous|date=[[2006-08-18]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref>

On [[March 19]] [[2007]], during a campaign appearance for the [[New South Wales general election, 2007|New South Wales State Election]], the then [[Opposition (Australia)|opposition leader]] [[Peter Debnam]] was confronted by Reucassel wearing nothing but [[Speedos]] and a baseball cap,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Speedowearing-comedian-confronts-Debnam/2007/03/19/1174152947020.html|title=Speedo wearing comedian confronts Debnam|date=[[2007-03-19]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref> making fun of Debnam's campaign appearances in the swimwear.  When TV cameras remained focused on Reucassel rather than Mr Debnam, he said, "Sorry, I'm not Peter Debnam, he's over there. Just because I'm wearing this doesn't mean I'm Peter Debnam".  Reucassel stuck around for the press conference but failed to draw a response from the opposition leader, and was again ignored when he went to shake Mr Debnam's hand.

=== Andrew Hansen's Mr. Ten Questions ===
On [[April 26]] [[2007]], Hansen, posing as his character Mr. Ten Questions, asked screen legend [[Sophia Loren]] 10 questions that seemed to have offended her.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21831963-2,00.html Loren lashes The Chaser] Sydney Morning Herald. Accessed on [[October 12]] [[2007]]</ref> Hansen was then taken from the building and Loren commented on Hansen as "terrible" and "silly". The incident made headlines that night.<ref>{{YouTube|jul-0Gnqahc|Channel 7 News}}</ref>

=== APEC prank and arrest ===
[[Image:Chaser fake apec pass.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Imitation ''insecurity'' passes used by ''The Chaser'' to breach the [[APEC Australia 2007]] restricted zone.]]

During the [[APEC Australia 2007|APEC Leaders Summit]] in [[Sydney]], on [[6 September]] [[2007]], Morrow and Licciardello along with nine other production crew members were arrested after they drove a fake [[Canadian]] [[motorcade]] down [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] and successfully breached the APEC restricted zone.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chaser-duo-held-over-apec-stunt/2007/09/06/1188783379922.html | title = Chaser duo held over APEC stunt | publisher = The Age |date=2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> It was reported that the motorcade finally came to a halt just metres from the hotel of the President of the United States [[George W. Bush]].<ref> {{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/06/2025910.htm | title = Police question Chaser duo over APEC stunt | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> Police only realised that the motorcade was a hoax when Licciardello, dressed as [[Osama bin Laden]], stepped out of the car replete with bonnet-mounted Canadian flag and complained in-character about not being invited.<ref> {{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/nation-of-larrikins-well-yes-and-no-/2007/09/08/1188783558424.html | title = Nation of larrikins?

Licciardello, Morrow and the nine crew members were immediately detained by [[NSW Police]], taken to Surry Hills Police Station, questioned and charged with ''entering a restricted area without special justification'' under the ''APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/06/2026372.htm | title = 11 charged over Chaser APEC stunt | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref>.

The stunt was planned and approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped and discovered at the first security checkpoint.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22388125-29277,00.html | title =  Chasers release new prank video | publisher = News.com.au |date=2007-09-09 | accessdate = 2007-09-09}}</ref> However, they managed to pass through two police security checkpoints, using a fake convoy of hired limousines, despite the fine print on the "APEC 2007 Official Vehicle" vehicle stickers  reading "This vehicle belongs to a member of The Chaser's War on Everything.

Despite condemnations by various public officials, the Sydney correspondent to the [[BBC]] reported that the ''Chaser'' team had become 'folk heroes' following the stunt.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6985775.stm | title =  Apec security leaves bitter taste in Sydney | publisher = bbc.co.uk |date=2007-09-09 | accessdate = 2007-09-10}}</ref> Furthermore, 87% of some 28,451 respondents to a web poll conducted by the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] found the stunt funny.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/polls/national/results.html Rate the Chaser stunt - Sydney Morning Herald Online Poll]</ref> Indeed, [[Alexander Downer]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]], appeared amused when asked to comment.<ref name="AGE-070907" />

Later on [[7 September]] [[2007]], three members of the Chaser and their film crew were questioned and released over a follow-up stunt involving running near the protected APEC zone dressed in cardboard cars topped with Canadian flags. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/07/2027186.htm|title=Police question Chasers over second APEC stunt|work=ABC news|publisher=abc.net.au|date=[[September 10]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref> The following Chaser  episode ended up giving ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' their highest ever ratings for an episode with 2.245 million viewers tuning in across Australia.<ref>

===Tim Freedman parody===
On [[7 October]] [[2007]], [[Tim Freedman]] singer and songwriter for rock band [[The Whitlams]] posted a message on the band's website, citing a parody of him which had gone to air on  [[3 October]].<ref>[http://www.thewhitlams.com/NEWS/default.asp?Mode=SINGLE&NewsID=68 I Love The Chaser], [[The Whitlams]], [[7 October]] [[2007]].</ref> The song, performed by Andrew Hansen, implied that Freedman was obsessed with the Sydney suburb of [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], and continually referred to the area in his songs. Freedman alluded that the lyrics had been written by Chris Taylor, and that the parody had been motivated by Taylor's break-up with a girl who had previously dated Freedman. This has in turn been denied by Taylor, having said the song had nothing to do with his relationship with her.<ref>[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=304362 Tim Freedman hits back at Chaser], [[NineMSN]], [[10 October]] [[2007]].</ref>

===<!--This heading is to remain creditless until further notice-->"The Eulogy Song"===  
On the [[October 17]] [[2007]] episode, Andrew Hansen sang a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU17zYt6nBQ song] that was written by Chris Taylor which satirised the lives of several deceased celebrities, including [[Peter Brock]], [[Princess Diana]], [[Donald Bradman]], [[Steve Irwin]], [[Jeff Buckley]] and [[Kerry Packer]], expressing the view that people with flaws during life are often disproportionately hailed as "top blokes" after death. The song became the target of significant media attention, with several radio and television personalities saying the song was in "bad taste", and both [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] and opposition leader [[Kevin Rudd]] expressing negative views. A few days later, the team approached John Howard on his morning walk, dressed as rabbits, and sparked a reaction from the Prime Minister, with him saying: "You blokes are a lot funnier when you pick on someone who's alive".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,22612694-5005368,00.html|title=PM lashes Chaser crew when ambushed on morning walk|publisher=PerthNow|accessdate=2007-10-21|}}</ref>

A number of news programs reported that the ABC's switchboard was jammed with calls from "disgusted viewers" immediately following the show. It was later revealed that only six calls had been made that night about the shot, three of them in a positive light. Although a number of complaints were received the next day the ABC alleged that a large number were listeners of a [[Neil Mitchell (radio announcer)|Melbourne radio show]], and that when asked many said they hadn't seen the show. In response some shows such as ''Today Tonight'' claimed many more complaints would follow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22607098-2,00.html|title=Howard, Rudd lash out at Chaser song|publisher=News.com.au|work=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>

In response to the attention, Chris Taylor supported the message, stating that it was a legitimate skit and that although the song mentioned recently deceased breast cancer victim [[Belinda Emmett]], the rest of the cast pretending to cut off Hansen before he completed her verse was "making a joke about the inappropriateness of making a joke about Belinda Emmett."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=306835|title=Chaser's war on good taste|publisher=[[MSN|NineMSN]]|work=[[National Nine News]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> He also revealed it was a "watered down" version of the song which was previously performed twice on stage in the musical 'Dead Caesar'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22606121-5007132,00.html|title= Offensive Chaser defends song war on dead celebs|publisher=News.com.au|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2007-10-18|last=McLean|first=Stuart}}</ref>

During the following episode on [[October 24]], [[2007]], an ad parody of the John Howard and Kevin Rudd [[YouTube]] advertisements aired in which Hansen started to play an additional verse to "The Eulogy Song" with reference to [[David Hookes]] before once again being cut off in the same style as the election advertisements (with the camera zooming out of a flat panel display with someone else pausing the video).

== Reception and impact ==
=== Current affairs programs ===
Current affairs programs, notably ''[[Today Tonight]]'' from [[Channel 7]] and ''[[A Current Affair]]'' from [[Channel 9]] have occasionally run pieces on The Chaser team, criticising them for some of their material. ''A Current Affair'' has aired segments which include rumours that the program was defecting to a commercial network,<ref name="aca1">{{cite web|url = http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?t=m164|title = The Chase Is On|date = [[2007-04-19]]|publisher = [[ninemsn]]}}</ref> overstepping the mark and dangerousness of stunts and using Osama bin Laden for jokes.<ref name="aca2">{{cite web|url = http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?t=m164|title = Pushing The Boundaries|date = [[2007-05-09]]|publisher = [[ninemsn]]}}</ref>

''Today Tonight'' has aired segments which show the Chaser's stunts were set-up, and criticising their role in breaking through APEC's security.<ref name="tt3">{{cite news|url = http://au.todaytonight.yahoo.com/|title = Is the Chaser's War just a set-up?|date = [[2007-06-13]]|publisher = [[Yahoo 7]]}}</ref><ref name="crikey">{{Cite web|url = http://www.crikey.com.au/Media-and-Arts/20070907-Media-briefs-and-TV-ratings.html|title = Today Tonight v The Chaser: who's got the credibility?|author = Dyer, Glen|date=2007-09-07|publisher = Crikey!}}</ref> However, when ''Today Tonight'' asked if they could follow The Chaser team on one of their stunts, The Chaser agreed. The Chaser chose a stunt that would embarrass the Channel 7 television program. They did so by having a "Meakin Booze Bus"; in reference to Channel 7 boss [[Peter Meakin]], who was recently convicted of drink driving. In the shoot, The Chaser members kept bringing up the topic of Peter Meakin to reporter James Thomas.<ref>Episode 12, Season 2: The Chaser’s War on Everything ABC</ref> It was revealed later that The Chaser did eventually answer enough of Thomas’ questions so that ''Today Tonight'' received what they wanted, but ''Today Tonight'' did not end up running that footage. They instead showed scenes where the members were seen as arrogant.<ref> Episode 12, Season 2: The Chaser’s War on Everything DVD Audio Commentary</ref>

=== Awards ===
In December 2006 ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' won an [[Australian Film Institute]] Award for 'Best Television Comedy Series' and Hansen won an AFI Award for 'Best Performance in a Television Comedy.'<ref>{{cite website|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791055/awards|title=Awards for "The Chaser's War on Everything"|publisher=IMDB Awards list}}</ref> In May 2007, the program was nominated for the [[TV Week]] [[Logie Award|Logie]] award "Most Outstanding Comedy Program", but lost to Channel Ten's 'Thank God You're Here'<ref name="Logies">{{cite web|url=http://tvweek.ninemsn.com.au/section.aspx?sectionid=1923&sectionname=logies&subsectionid=9488&subsectionname=2007nominees|title=TV Week - Most Outstanding Comedy Program|accessdate=2007-05-07|publisher=ninemsn Pty Ltd.}}</ref>
