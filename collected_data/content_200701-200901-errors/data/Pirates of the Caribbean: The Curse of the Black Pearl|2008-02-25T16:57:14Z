'''''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl''''' is a 2003 [[adventure film]], inspired by [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' ride]] at [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]]. The story follows [[piracy|pirate]] Captain [[Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) and blacksmith [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) as they rescue [[Elizabeth Swann]] ([[Keira Knightley]]) from her kidnapping by the cursed crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', captained by [[Hector Barbossa]] ([[Geoffrey Rush]]).

The film was directed by [[Gore Verbinski]] and produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], and became the first [[Walt Disney Pictures]] release to earn a PG-13 rating by the [[MPAA]] (all previous WDP releases were rated G or PG). The world premiere was held at [[Disneyland Resort]] in [[Anaheim, California]], on [[June 28]], [[2003]]. ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' was an unexpected success, with mostly positive reviews and grossing almost [[United States dollar|$]]654 million worldwide. The film became the first in a [[Pirates of the Caribbean films|series]], with two back-to-back sequels, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', released.

==Plot==
As Governor [[Weatherby Swann]] and his daughter, [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]], sail to [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]], their ship, HMS ''[[Dauntless (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Dauntless]]'' encounters a shipwreck with a sole survivor, the young [[Will Turner]]. Elizabeth finds and takes a gold skull medallion from around the unconscious Will's neck and hides it, fearing he will be accused of piracy. She then sees the ghostly ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Eight years later, [[James Norrington|Captain James Norrington]] of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Royal Navy]] is promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]]. At his ceremony, he proposes to Elizabeth, but before answering, she tumbles into the bay due to an overly tight [[corset]] which constricts her breathing. The skull medallion she is wearing emits a mysterious pulse through the water. Meanwhile, pirate [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] has arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship. Seeing Elizabeth fall, he rescues her, but is promptly arrested for piracy. He escapes and ducks into a blacksmith shop where he encounters Will Turner, now a blacksmith's apprentice and self-taught expert swordsman. Following a swordfight with Turner, Sparrow is knocked unconscious and jailed, to be [[hanged]] the next day. That night, Port Royal is besieged by the ''Black Pearl'', having been called by the mysterious pulse from Elizabeth's medallion. Elizabeth is captured and invokes [[parley]]&mdash; an agreement ensuring one's safety until meeting and negotiating with the opposing side. To protect her identity, Elizabeth tells Captain [[Hector Barbossa]] her last name is "Turner". She negotiates for the pirates to cease the attack on Port Royal in exchange for the medallion. Barbossa agrees, but employing a loophole in their agreement, he keeps Elizabeth prisoner, believing she is the key to breaking an ancient curse they are under.

Unable to persuade [[James Norrington|Commodore Norrington]] to take immediate action, Will, who is in love with Elizabeth, persuades Jack Sparrow to help him rescue Elizabeth in exchange for freeing him from jail. Jack agrees only after learning Will's last name. After commandeering HMS ''[[Interceptor (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Interceptor]]'' Jack and Will recruit a crew in [[Tortuga]] with help from Jack's friend, [[Joshamee Gibbs|Gibbs]]. They set sail for [[Isla de Muerta]], a mysterious island Jack knows the pirates will go to to break the curse. While sailing their route, Will learns the ''Black Pearl'' was formerly commanded by Sparrow. When Jack shared the bearings to a hidden chest of [[Aztec]] [[gold]] coins, First Mate Barbossa instigated a [[mutiny]] and [[marooned]] Jack on an island. Jack escaped three days later. The pirates found and spent the treasure but soon learned it was cursed&mdash;rendering them into immortal skeletal beings whose true forms are only revealed in moonlight. The curse can only be lifted when every coin and each pirate's blood is returned to the chest. [["Bootstrap Bill" Turner]] sent a coin to his son, William, believing the crew should remain cursed for what they did to Jack.  Barbossa then ordered Bootstrap tied to a cannon and thrown overboard only to realize later his blood is also needed to break the curse; a Turner kin must now take his place. Believing Elizabeth is Bootstrap's child, Barbossa poises her over the Aztec chest, anoints the last coin with her [[blood]] and drops it into the chest&mdash;unsurprisingly, the curse remains in effect. 

On the island, Will suspects Sparrow may betray him and knocks him out. He rescues Elizabeth, and they escape to the ''Interceptor''. Jack barters with Barbossa&mdash;in exchange for revealing Bootstrap's real child, he wants to captain the ''Black Pearl''.  Jack's negotiations come to naught, however, when the ''Pearl'' pursues the ''Interceptor'', sinking her and taking the crew captive. Will reveals that he is Bootstrap Bill's true offspring and demands that Elizabeth and the crew be freed. Otherwise, he threatens to shoot himself and fall overboard, lost forever. Barbossa agrees but craftily applies another loophole and strands Elizabeth and Jack on a deserted island (the same island Jack was marooned on ten years before) and throws Jack's crew into the brig. Will is taken back to Isla de Muerta for the ritual. 

Elizabeth burns a cache of abandoned rum to create a signal fire that is spotted by Norrington. She convinces Norrington to rescue Will by accepting his earlier marriage proposal. Arriving at the island, Norrington sets an ambush outside the cave while Jack goes inside and persuades Barbossa to form an alliance. He tells him to delay breaking the curse until after they have taken the ''[[Dauntless (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Dauntless]]'' and killed the crew. Jack then sneaks a coin from the chest, rendering himself immortal. But whatever Jack's actual intent is, his plan goes awry when Barbossa orders his crew to infiltrate the ''Dauntless'' from underwater.  Jack's true allegiance is revealed when he attacks and then shoots Barbossa. Jack tosses his bloodied coin to Will, who returns the last two medallions to the chest, breaking the curse.  No longer immortal, the fatally wounded Barbossa falls dead. Realizing they are no longer cursed, the now-mortal pirates surrender to the navy. Back in Port Royal, Jack is about to be executed. Believing Jack deserves to live, Will rescues him. Both are quickly captured, but Elizabeth lends her support and declares her love for Will. Norrington releases her from their engagement, and Will is pardoned. Meanwhile, Jack escapes by falling into the bay. His crew, who escaped with the ''Black Pearl'', rescue him. Norrington is impressed enough to allow him one day's head start before giving pursuit.

==Cast==
*'''[[Johnny Depp]]''' as '''[[Captain Jack Sparrow]]''': An eccentric pirate noted for a slightly drunken swagger, accompanied by slurred speech and awkwardly flailing hand gestures. His obsession for rum is only matched by his obsession with regaining the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', which he captained ten years before. Jack uses his wits rather than weapons, and has gained a reputation with made up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. The actor found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the ''Black Pearl'' were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place.<ref name="director"/> Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, "a young [[Burt Lancaster]], just the cocky pirate." At the first [[read-through]], Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner.<ref name="cocky">{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = Pirates of the Caribbean 2 | pages = 68| publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2006-07-01]] | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> After researching 18th century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on [[Keith Richards]].<ref name="talk"/> Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional [[Errol Flynn]]-type,<ref name="director"/> Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, "He's ruining the film!"<ref name="cocky"/> Depp answered back, "Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot."<ref name="talk"/>

*'''[[Orlando Bloom]]''' as '''[[Will Turner]]''': A blacksmith's apprentice working in Port Royal, he is in love with Elizabeth Swann. Will struggles with the fact his father, "Bootstrap" Bill, was a pirate, unable to reconcile that he was a good man too. Bloom read the script after Geoffrey Rush, whom he was working with on ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 film)|Ned Kelly]]'', suggested it to him.<ref>{{cite news | author = Caroline Westbrook | title = Pirates films tests its stars | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = [[2003-08-08]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3132669.stm | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> 

*'''[[Keira Knightley]]''' as '''[[Elizabeth Swann]]''': The daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth has been fascinated with pirates since childhood. During the ''Black Pearl&#39;''s attack on Port Royal, she gives her name as Turner and is mistaken for "Bootstrap" Bill's child. She also is in love with Will Turner. Elizabeth abandons the "damsel in distress" image and in time her personality changes to that of a noble pirate. Knightley came as a surprise to Verbinski: he had not seen her performance in ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' and was impressed by her audition.<ref name="director"/>

*'''[[Geoffrey Rush]]''' as '''[[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]]''': The captain of the ''Black Pearl'', he was Captain Jack Sparrow's first mate before he led a mutiny ten years before. He and his crew stole cursed Aztec gold, for which they walk the Earth forever. He has a love of green apples and his monkey Jack, which never leaves his side. [[Robert De Niro]] turned down the role because he felt the film would flop as all pirate films before did. He regretted the decision later, voting for ''Curse of the Black Pearl'' for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[Academy Award]]s ballot, and accepting the role of Captain Shakespeare in ''[[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]]'' out of his regret for turning down ''Pirates of the Caribbean''.<ref>[[Robert De Niro]], [[B105 FM]] interview on [[September 20]] [[2007]]</ref> Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa, as he knew he would not play it with attempts at complexity, but with a simple villainy that would suit the story's tone.<ref name="director">{{cite video | people = [[Gore Verbinski]], [[Johnny Depp]] | title = Audio Commentary | format = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | year = 2003}}</ref>

*'''[[Jack Davenport]]''' as '''[[James Norrington|Commodore Norrington]]''': An officer in the Royal Navy who is in love with Elizabeth, and also has a deep-seated dislike for pirates. He considers Jack Sparrow to be, "the worst pirate I have ever heard of".
*'''[[Jonathan Pryce]]''' as '''[[Weatherby Swann|Governor Weatherby Swann]]''': Governor of Port Royal, Jamaica and father of Elizabeth Swann. [[Tom Wilkinson (actor)|Tom Wilkinson]] was negotiated with to play the part,<ref name="greg"/> but the role went to Pryce, whom Depp idolized.<ref name="director"/>
*'''[[Lee Arenberg]]''' as '''[[Ragetti & Pintel|Pintel]]''': A pirate aboard the ''Black Pearl''. He and Ragetti dress up as women to provide the distraction that allows the cursed pirates to board the Dauntless near the end of the movie.
*'''[[Mackenzie Crook]]''' as '''[[Ragetti & Pintel|Ragetti]]''': A pirate aboard the Black Pearl, Pintel's buddy, with a wooden eye that never seems to stay in place.
*'''[[Kevin McNally]]''' as '''[[Joshamee Gibbs]]''': Jack Sparrow's friend and first mate, he was once a sailor for the Royal Navy. He is usually the one who tells the legends of Jack Sparrow.
*'''[[Zoë Saldaña]]''' as '''[[Anamaria]]''': A female pirate furious with Jack Sparrow for stealing her boat. He promises her the ''Interceptor'' in an attempt to assuage her anger.

==Development==
During the early 1990s,<ref name="perfection">{{cite news | author = Gerard Raiti | title = ILM and Disney Make Pirate Perfection | publisher = VFXWorld | date = [[2003-07-11]] | url = http://vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=1e242f07&atype=articles&id=1798&page=1 | accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> screenwriters [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] conceived of writing a film based on the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' ride. In their original pitch, Will Turner was the lead role, and the villainous pirates were searching for treasure. [[Steven Spielberg]] expressed interest, and wanted to cast [[Bill Murray]], [[Robin Williams]] or [[Steve Martin]] as [[Jack Sparrow]]. Disney was already making ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' at the time and did not give permission for the film to be made because the two had similar storylines.<ref>[[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], [[B105 FM]] on [[July 10]] [[2006]]</ref>

Disney had [[Jay Wolpert]] write a script based on the ride, which producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] rejected, feeling it was, "a straight pirate movie."<ref name="talk">{{cite news | author=Stax | title = Depp & Bruckheimer Talk Pirates | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2003-06-25]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/425/425848p1.html | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> [[Stuart Beattie]] was brought in to rewrite the script in March 2002, due to his knowledge of [[piracy]],<ref name="greg">{{cite web | author = Greg Dean Schmitz | title = Greg's Previews - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) | publisher = [[Yahoo!]] | url = http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&cf=prev&id=1808405416&gpt=ch | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> and later that month Elliott and Rossio were brought in.<ref name="talk"/> Elliott and Rossio were inspired by the opening narration of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' theme park ride, and decided to give the film a supernatural edge.<ref name="writers">{{cite video | people = [[Ted Elliott]], [[Terry Rossio]], [[Stuart Beattie]], [[Jay Wolpert]] | title = Audio Commentary | format = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | year = 2003}}</ref> As the budget rose, [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Bob Iger]] threatened to cancel the film, though Bruckheimer changed their minds when he showed them concept art and animatics.<ref>{{cite news | title = Exclusive Interview: Jerry Bruckheimer | publisher = Moviehole | date = [[2007-05-21]] | url = http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070521_exclusive_interview_jerry_bruc.html | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> In May 2002 [[Gore Verbinski]] signed on to direct ''Pirates of the Caribbean''.<ref name="greg"/> He was attracted to the idea of using modern technology to resurrect a genre that had disappeared after the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]], and recalled his childhood memories of the ride, feeling the film was an opportunity to pay tribute to the "scary and funny" tone of it.<ref name="director"/>

===Design===
Verbinski did not want an entirely romanticized feel to the film: he wanted a sense of [[historical fantasy]]. Most of the actors wore prosthetics and contact lenses. Depp had contacts that acted as [[sunglasses]], while Rush and [[Lee Arenberg]] wore dulled contacts that gave a sinister feel to the characters. [[Mackenzie Crook]] wore two contacts to represent his character's wooden eye: a soft version, and a harder version for when it protrudes. In addition, their rotten teeth and scurvy skin were dyed on,<ref name="epic">{{cite video | title = An Epic At Sea: The Making of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl | format = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | year = 2003}}</ref> although Depp did have gold teeth added, which he forgot to remove after filming.<ref>{{cite news | title = Depp's Golden Teeth | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | date = [[2003-06-23]] | url = http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2003-06-23#celeb5 | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> Depp also used a genuine pistol which was made in 1760 in [[London]], which the crew bought from a dealer in [[Connecticut]].<ref name="epic"/> The crew spent five months creating the cavern in which Barbossa and the ''Black Pearl'' crew attempt to reverse their curse,<ref name="perfection"/> filling it with five feet of water, eight hundred and eighty-two Aztec coins and some gold paint on the styrofoam rocks for more impressions of treasure. The crew also built the fortress at [[Port Royal]] in [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California]], and Governor Swann's palace was built at [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]].<ref name="epic"/> A fire broke in September 2002, causing $525,000 worth of damage, though no one was injured.<ref>{{cite news | title = 'Pirates' Hit By Blaze | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | date = [[2002-09-12]] | url = http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2002-09-12#celeb4 | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref>
[[Image:Dauntlessbarge.jpg|thumb|200px|The barge used for the ''Dauntless'']]
The filmmakers chose [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] as their primary shooting location, as it was the most quiet beach they could find, and built three piers and a backlot for [[Port Royal]] and [[Geography of Pirates of the Caribbean#Tortuga|Tortuga]].<ref name="epic"/> Of most importance to the film were the three ships: the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', the ''[[Dauntless (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Dauntless]]'' and the ''[[Interceptor (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Interceptor]]''. For budget reasons, the ships were built on docks, with only six days spent in the open sea for the battle between the ''Black Pearl'' and the ''Interceptor''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = Thrill Ride | pages = 87 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2003-07-25]] | accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> The ''Dauntless'' and the ''Black Pearl'' were built on barges, with [[computer-generated imagery]] finishing the structures. The ''Black Pearl'' was also built on the [[Spruce Goose#Postwar|Spruce Goose stage]], in order to control fog and lighting.<ref name="epic"/> The ''Interceptor'' was a re-dressed ''[[Lady Washington]]'', a functional sailing ship from Seattle, fully repainted before going on a 40-day voyage beginning [[December 2]] [[2002]], arriving on location on [[January 12]] [[2003]].<ref>{{cite video | title = Diary of a Ship | format = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | year = 2003}}</ref> A miniature was also built for the storm sequence.<ref name="epic"/>

===Production===
Shooting began on [[October 9]] [[2002]] and wrapped by March 2003.<ref name="greg"/> The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the ''Interceptor'', three of the ropes attaching it to the ''Dauntless'' did not break at first, and when they did snap debris hit Depp's knee, though he was not injured, and the way the incident played out on film made it look like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident was when the boat Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank.<ref name="director"/> In October the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at St. Vincent and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite video | title = Fly on the Set | format = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | year = 2003}}</ref> The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs ([[Kevin McNally]]) telling Will how Sparrow escaped from an island, strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair, and Pryce was written into the climactic battle to keep some empathy for the audience.<ref name="director"/>

Due to the quick schedule of the shoot, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal forms of the pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons,<ref name="perfection"/> an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras.<ref name="director"/> The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the [[motion capture]] stage.<ref name="epic"/> With the shoot only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent eighteen-hour days on the edit,<ref name="director"/> while at the same time spending time on six hundred effects shots, two hundred and fifty of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Hewitt | title = Caribbean Queen | pages = 31 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2003-05-30]] | accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> He also had to quickly manage the score with [[Klaus Badelt]] and [[Hans Zimmer]], who headed 15 composers to finish the score quickly.<ref name="director"/>

==Reception==
Before its release, many had expected ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' to be a flop, as the pirate genre had not been successful for years, with ''[[Cutthroat Island]]'' (1995) a notable flop, that the film was based on a theme park ride, and that Johnny Depp rarely made a big film.<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Nashawaty | title = Box Office Buccaneer | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20037288_20037290_465481,00.html | accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Walt Disney Pictures also took a big risk in allowing it to be the first [[PG-13]] rated film by the studio, with one executive noting that she found the film too intense for her five-year old child.<ref name="talk"/> Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' subtitle to the film in case sequels were made.<ref name="greg"/> Their confidence paid off: ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' grossed approximately $47 million in its U.S. opening weekend, before grossing $305 million domestically in a worldwide total of approximately $654 million, becoming the fourth highest grossing film of 2003.<ref>{{cite web | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl | publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]] | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=piratesofthecaribbean.htm | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref>

Critics favourably received the film, as indicated by a 79% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with 153 positive reviews out of 193 listed.<ref>{{cite web | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl | publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl/ | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> Alan Morrison of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' felt it was "the best blockbuster of the summer", acclaiming all the comic performances despite his disappointment with the swashbuckling sequences.<ref>{{cite news | author = Alan Morrison | title = Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=9271 | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] acclaimed Depp and Rush's performances, with "It can be said that [Depp's] performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie... his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal." However, he felt the film went for too long,<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | title = Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = [[2003-07-09]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030709/REVIEWS/307090301/1023 | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> a criticism shared by [[Kenneth Turan|Kenneth Turan's]] highly negative review, feeling it "spends far too much time on its huge supporting cast of pirates (nowhere near as entertaining as everyone assumes) and on bloated adventure set pieces that redound to no one's credit", despite having also enjoyed Depp's performance.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Kenneth Turan]] | title = 'Pirates of the Caribbean' | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | url = http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan9jul09,2,3211342.story | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref>

For his performance as [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]], [[Johnny Depp]] won Best Actor at the [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], the [[MTV Movie Awards]] and the [[Empire Awards]], and was also nominated but didn't win at the [[Golden Globe]]s, the [[BAFTA Awards]] and the [[76th Academy Awards]], in which ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' was also nominated for Makeup, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Visual Effects. Awards won by ''Curse of the Black Pearl'' include Best Make-Up/Hair at the [[BAFTA Awards]], a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Costumes, a [[Golden Reel Award]] for Sound Editing, two [[VES Award]]s for visual effects, and the [[People's Choice Awards]] for Favorite Motion Picture.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/awards | title= Awards for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref>
