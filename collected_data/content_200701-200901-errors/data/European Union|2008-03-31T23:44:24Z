The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a political and economic community of twenty-seven [[European Union member state|member states]], located primarily in [[Europe]]. It was established in 1993 by the [[Maastricht treaty|Treaty of Maastricht]], adding new areas of policy to the existing [[European Community]] founded in 1957. With almost 500&nbsp;million citizens, the EU generates an estimated 30% share of the world's nominal [[gross domestic product|gross domestic product]] (GDP) ([[United States dollar|US$]]16.6 trillion) in 2007.<ref name="GDP IMF"/> 

The EU has developed a [[single market]] through a standardised system of laws which apply in all [[European Union member state|member states]], guaranteeing the [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital]].<ref name="Europa Internal Market">{{cite web |title=The EU Single Market: Fewer barriers, more opportunities |publisher=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]], European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-09-27}} {{cite web|title=Activities of the European Union: Internal Market |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> It maintains a common trade policy, [[Common Agricultural Policy|agricultural]] and [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]] policies, and a [[Regional policy of the European Union|regional development policy]].<ref name="Farah">{{cite web|last=Farah|first=Paolo|title=Five Years of China WTO Membership.

It has developed a role in [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]], representing its members in the [[World Trade Organization]],  at [[G8]] summits and at the [[United Nations]]. Twenty-one EU countries are members of [[NATO]]. It has developed a role in justice and home affairs, including the abolition of passport control between many member states under the [[Schengen Agreement]].<ref name="Internal borders"> {{cite web|title=Abolition of internal borders and creation of a single EU external frontier|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2005|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/freetravel/frontiers/fsj_freetravel_schengen_en.htm|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

EU operation is a hybrid of [[intergovernmentalism]] and [[supranationalism]]. In certain areas it depends on unanimous agreement between all the member states. In others, the EU has established supranational bodies, able to make decisions binding upon all the members. Important institutions and bodies of the EU include the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Council]], the [[European Court of Justice]] and the [[European Central Bank]]. [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] elect the Parliament every five years.

===European Coal and Steel Community===
{{see|Pax Europea|End of World War II in Europe|European Coal and Steel Community}}
[[Image:Schuman Declaration.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Schuman]] [[Schuman Declaration|proposed]] the [[European Coal and Steel Community|Coal and Steel Community]] in  1950.]]

The political climate after the end of [[World War II]] favoured  Western European unity, seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of [[nationalism]] which had devastated the continent.<ref>{{cite web |title=The political consequences |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu/?doc=242&lang=3 |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> One of the first successful proposals for [[European integration|European cooperation]] came in 1951 with the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. This had the aim of bringing together control of the [[coal]] and [[steel]] industries of its member states, principally [[France]] and [[West Germany]]. This was with the aim that war between them would not then be possible, as coal and steel were the principal resources for waging war. The Community's founders declared it "a first step in the [[Federal Europe|federation of Europe]]"", with the hope that this would enable Europe to pursue the development of Africa.<ref>{{cite web |title=Declaration of 9 May 1950 |url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> The other founding members were [[Italy]], and the three [[Benelux]] countries: [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].<ref name="Europa History 45-59">{{cite web |title=A peaceful Europe - the beginnings of cooperation |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]

===European Communities===
{{see|Treaty of Rome|European Community}}
Two additional communities were created in 1957: the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC) establishing a [[customs union]], and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) for cooperation in developing [[nuclear energy]].<ref name="Europa History 45-59"/> In 1967 the [[Merger Treaty]] created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the ''European Communities'', although more commonly just as the ''[[European Community]]'' (EC).<ref name="ENA Merge">{{cite web |title=Merging the executives |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=473 |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

[[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|left|The 1957 [[Treaty of Rome|Rome Treaty]] created the [[European Community|European Economic Community]]]]

In 1973 the European Communities enlarged to include [[Denmark]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="ENA First enlargement">{{cite web |title=The first enlargement |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=555 |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> [[Norway]] had negotiated to join at the same time but a referendum rejected membership and so it remained outside. 

The [[European Parliament election, 1979|first direct, democratic elections]] of members of the European Parliament were held in 1979.<ref name="ENA New Parliament">{{cite web |title=The new European Parliament |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=571 |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> They were the first [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] to be held, allowing citizens to elect 410 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] to the [[European Parliament]], and also the first international election in history.

The [[Maastricht Treaty]] came into force on [[1 November]] [[1993]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Treaty of Maastricht on European Union |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/treaties/maastricht_en.htm |work=Activities of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| accessdate=2007-10-20}}; {{cite book |last=Craig |first=Paul |coauthors=Grainne De Burca , P.

The European Community now formed one of [[Three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] of the new ''European Union'', which included co-operation in matters of [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]] and [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|home affairs]]. The term ''European Union'' generally replaced the term ''European Community'', which will be abolished by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] along with the pillar system.

[[Austria]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] joined in 1995. The [[Amsterdam Treaty]] in 1997 amended the Maastricht treaty in areas such as democracy and foreign policy. Amsterdam was followed by the [[Treaty of Nice]] in 2001, which revised the Rome and Maastricht treaties to allow the EU to cope with further enlargement to the east. 

In 2002, twelve member states adopted the [[euro]] as a single currency. Since then, the [[Eurozone]] has increased to encompassing fifteen countries. In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when ten new countries, most of which former parts of the [[Eastern Bloc]], acceded the Union.<ref name="Europa History 00">{{cite web |title=A decade of further expansion |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> Three years later, two more joined.<ref name="Europa History 00"/>

A treaty establishing a [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|constitution for the EU]] was signed in [[Rome]] in 2004, intended to replace all previous treaties with a single document. However, it never completed ratification after rejection by French and Dutch voters in [[referendum|referenda]]. In 2007, it was agreed to replace that proposal with a new [[Treaty of Lisbon|Reform Treaty]], that would amend rather than replace the [[Treaties of the European Union|existing treaties]]. This treaty was signed on [[13 December]] [[2007]] in [[Lisbon]] and is known as the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon treaty]].<ref name="Europa Lisbon treaty"/> It will come in effect in January 2009 if ratified by that date.

The European Union is composed of 27 [[Independence|independent]] [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[country|countries]] which are known as member states: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web |title=European Countries |url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/index_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> There are three official candidate countries, [[Croatia]], [[FYROM]] and [[Turkey]]; the western Balkan countries of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]] are officially recognised as potential candidates.<ref name="Europa Enlargement">{{cite web |title=European Commission - Enlargement - Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries |publisher= [[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> [[Kosovo]] has been granted similar status.<ref name="EU Council on Kosovo">{{cite web |title=EU/Kosovo Factsheet |publisher= European Union - Delegation of the European Commission to the United States|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/gena/98770.pdf |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

To join the EU, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 [[Copenhagen]] European Council. These require a stable democracy which respects [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning market economy capable of competition within the EU; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the [[European Council]].<ref name="Accession Criteria">{{cite web |title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria) |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> The current framework does not specify how a country could exit the Union (although [[Greenland]] withdrew in 1985), but the proposed [[Treaty of Lisbon]] contains a formal procedure for withdrawing. 

Four Western European countries that have chosen not to join the EU have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]] are a part of the [[single market]] through the [[European Economic Area]], and [[Switzerland]] has similar ties through [[bilateralism|bilateral]] treaties. <ref name="EEA"/><ref name="CH">{{cite web |title=The EU's relations with Switzerland|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/switzerland/intro/index.htm |accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref>  The relationships of [[Microstates and the European Union| european microstates]]  [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Vatican City]] can include use of the [[euro]] and other co-operation.<ref name="euro use world"/>

===Geography===
{{main|Geography of the European Union}}
[[Image:Mont Blanc depuis la gare des glaciers.jpg|thumb|[[Mont Blanc]] in the [[Alps]] is the highest peak in the EU.]]

The territory of the EU consists of the combined territories of its 27 member states with some exceptions outlined below. The territory of the EU is not the same as that of [[Geography of Europe|Europe]], as parts of the continent are outside the EU, such as [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]] and European [[Russia]]. Some parts of member countries are not part of the EU, despite forming part of the European continent (for example the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Faroe Islands]]). Several territories associated with member states that are outside geographic Europe are also not part of the EU (such as [[Greenland]], [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and all the non-European territories associated with the [[United Kingdom]]). Some [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories]] are part of the EU even if they are not geographically part of Europe, such as the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Madeira]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]], [[Saint Barthélemy]] and [[Saint Martin]].<ref name="Amsterdam">{{cite web|title=Treaty of Amsterdam|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[EUR-Lex]]: Official Journal|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref><ref name="Consolidated Treaties">{{cite web|title=Consolidated Treaties on European Union and establishing the European Community|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|author=[[EUR-Lex]]|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2006:321E:0001:0331:EN:pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ECB where euro">{{cite web|title=Where is the euro legal tender?|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|date=2006|url=http://www.ecb.int/bc/faqbc/circulation/html/index.en.html#q2|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The EU is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sources of EU law |url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> The treaties lay down the broad policy goals of the organisation and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals.

The EU is regulated by a number of institutions, primarily the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], and [[European Parliament]]. 

The EU is often described as being divided into three areas of responsibility, called '[[Three pillars of the European Union|pillars]]'. The original European Community policies form the first pillar, while the second consists of [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]]. The third pillar originally consisted of Justice and Home Affairs, however owing to changes introduced by the Amsterdam and Nice treaties, it currently only consists of [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]]. Broadly speaking, the second and third pillars can be described as the intergovernmental pillars because the supranational institutions of the Commission, Parliament and the Court of Justice play less of a role or none at all, while the lead is taken by the intergovernmental Council of Ministers and the European Council. Most activities of the EU come under the first, Community pillar. This is mostly economically oriented and the supranational institutions have more influence.<ref name="Glossary Pillars">{{cite web |title=Pillars of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/eu_pillars_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> 

===Commission===
{{main|European Commission}}
[[Image:European Commission outside.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlaymont building|Berlaymont]] in [[Brussels]] houses the [[European Commission]]]]
The [[European Commission]] acts as the EU's [[Executive (government)|executive arm]] and is responsible for [[Legislative initiative|initiating legislation]] and the day-to-day running of the EU. It is intended to act solely in the interest of the EU as a whole, as opposed to the Council which consists of leaders of member states who reflect national interests. The commission is also seen as the motor of [[European integration]]. It is currently composed of 27 [[European Commissioner|commissioners]] for different areas of policy, one from each member state.

The [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]] and all the other commissioners are nominated by the Council. Appointment of the Commission President, and also the Commission in its entirety, have to be confirmed by Parliament.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission">{{cite web |title=Institutions: The European Commission |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

===Council===
{{main|Council of the European Union|European Council}}
The [[Council of the European Union]] forms one half of the EU's [[legislature]]. It is an organised platform where national ministers responsible for the area of policy being addressed, meet. Although the Council meets in different compositions, it is considered to be one single body.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council">{{cite web |title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises executive functions in relations to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].

The rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the EU Council]] is taken by each member state in turn for a period of six months, during which the relevant member chairs most meetings of the Council.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council"/> The member state holding the presidency typically uses it to drive and focus on a limited number of policy areas; such as various types of reform, enlargement or external relations with a specific part of the world.

Highest-ranking political leadership in the EU is provided by the [[European Council]] (not to be mistaken for the [[Council of Europe]]), which is the EU Council when composed of heads of government of the member states (e.g. the [[prime minister]] or [[President]]) plus the [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]]. The European Council meets on at least four [[List of European Councils|summits]] a year, and is lead by the head of government of the rotating presidency.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council"/>

===Parliament===
{{main|European Parliament}}
[[Image:EP Strasbourg hemicycle l-gal.jpg|thumb|The [[Hemicycle (chamber)|hemicycle]] of the Parliament's [[Seat_of_the_European_Parliament_in_Strasbourg#Louise_Weiss|Louise Weiss building]] in Strasbourg]]
The other half of the EU's [[legislature]] is the [[European Parliament]]. The 785 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are directly elected by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] every five years. Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats. The Parliament and the Council form and pass legislation jointly, using [[codecision procedure|codecision]], in certain areas of policy. This procedure will extend to many new areas under the proposed [[Treaty of Lisbon]], and hence increase the power and relevance of the Parliament. The Parliament also has the power to reject or censure the Commission and the EU budget. The [[President of the European Parliament]] carries out the role of [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] in parliament and represents it externally. The president and vice presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.<ref name="Europa Institutions Parliament">{{cite web |title=Institutions: The European Parliament |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

===Legal System===
{{see|Law of the European Union|Treaties of the European Union}}
Although the Treaties are the ultimate source of EU Law, there are a number of legislative instruments available to the EU institutions. The three main instruments are [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulations]], [[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] and [[European Union decision|Decisions]]. There is no formal hierarchy regarding the three types.

'''Regulations''' are legislative acts which become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures to have been taken by member states.<ref>See: Case 34/73, ''Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze'' [1973] ECR 981</ref> Once in force their contents automatically override conflicting domestic provisions, as a result of having [[direct effect]] in the national law of the member states.<ref name="art249 Rome"/>

'''Directives''' require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result within a certain time period. Directives are generally used where it is thought preferable to leave the precise details of legislative implementation to national governments.<ref>To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 27 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115</ref> Once the stated time period has passed, under certain conditions provisions within a Directive may have [[direct effect]] in national law against Member States.

[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|The [[European Court of Justice|ECJ]] in [[Luxembourg]] can judge member states over EU law]]

'''Decisions''' offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. The Council and the Commission may publish in the official journal a decision, notified to a particular addressee, such as an individual trader or a company. Decisions will be found most commonly in [[European Community competition law|Competition Law]], or on rulings on [[subsidy|State Aid]], and can be challenged by the addressee under certain circumstances before the [[European Court of Justice|EU courts]].

The EU's legal system contains a multiplicity of legislative procedures used to enact the above legislation. The treaties provide the basis for all legislation and lay down the different ways of adopting legislation for different policy areas.<ref>For a good example of this see Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty of Rome, Council Decision (2004/927/EC) of [[22 December]] [[2004]] providing for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty and the Protocol on Article 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Community attached to the Nice Treaty.</ref> A common feature of the EU's legislative procedures is that almost all legislation must be proposed by the Commission, rather than member states or European parliamentarians. The two most common procedures are co-decision, under which the European Parliament can veto proposed legislation, and consultation, under which Parliament is only permitted to give an opinion which can be ignored by European leaders. In most  cases legislation must be agreed by the council.<ref name="decision making">{{cite web| title=Decision-making in the European Union|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm| accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> See: [[European Union legislative procedure]].

===Courts===
{{see|European Court of Justice}}
The judicial branch of the EU consists of the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) and the [[Court of First Instance]] (to be renamed the "General Court" upon the entering into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]). Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU.<ref name="art220 Rome"> {{cite web |title=European Community consolidated treaty, (article 220, The court of Justice) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> The Court of First Instance mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts, and the ECJ primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions and cases referred to the EU's courts by the courts of member states.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Court of Justice of the European Communities |url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/cje.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |accessdate=2007-09-14}};{{cite web |title=The Court of First Instance |url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/tpi.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|accessdate=2007-09-14}}; {{cite web |title=Institutions: Court of Justice |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/justice/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> Decisions from the Court of First Instance can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.<ref name="art225(1) Rome"> {{cite web |title=European Community consolidated treaty, (article 225 (1), The court of First Instance) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>

National courts within the Member States also play a key role in the EU as enforcers of EU law, and a "spirit of cooperation" between EU and national courts is laid down in the Treaties. National courts can apply EU law in domestic cases, and if they require clarification on the interpretation or validity of any EU legislation related to the case it may make a reference for a preliminary ruling to the ECJ. The right to declare EU legislation invalid however is reserved to the EU courts.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}
[[Image:José Manuel Barroso MEDEF 2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[President of the European Commission|Commission President]] [[José Manuel Barroso]]]]

Two major political issues for the EU are [[European integration]] and [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. Enlargement, the accession of new states to the EU, is a highly politicised issue. Supporters argue it aids democracy in new members, as well as supporting the European economy as a whole. Opponents fear the EU is expanding beyond its current political capabilities, and/or cultural boundaries. Public opinion, and hence political party viewpoint, has been more skeptical towards enlargement since the simultaneous accession of 10 members in 2004. This is most acute in relation to the [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|candidacy of Turkey]].<ref name="IHT fatigue">{{cite web|last=Smale|first=Alison|last2=Bilefsky|first2=Dan|title=Fighting EU 'enlargement fatigue'|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2006-06-19]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/19/news/eu.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref><ref name="Enlargement voice">{{cite web|title=EU enlargement - voices from the debate|publisher=British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1139992114487|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref><ref name="BBC Turkey">{{cite web|title=Q&A: Turkey's EU entry talks|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2006-12-11]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4107919.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> 

Integration is another political issue, where the public view is sometimes that national interest conflicts with that of the EU. The aim of increasing harmonisation between states has meant that national powers have been transferred to the European level. This is criticised by [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]] who fear the loss of national [[sovereignty]].<ref name="Anti-EU">{{cite web|title=FAQs on the EU, from the campaign trail|publisher=Sovereignty|date=2001|url=http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/campquest.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> In 2004 the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] was agreed between national leaders and the EU institutions. However it did not come into force after it was rejected in referenda in two countries, with the prospect of further rejections had attempts at ratification continued. In October 2007 European leaders finalised a new [[Treaty of Lisbon]] which contains much of the now defunct constitution, without the latter's constitutional terms and elements.

The treaty is expected to come into force in 2009. If ratified it will introduce more [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|majority voting in the Council]] and increase the powers of the European Parliament. The treaty also proposes to abolish the EU's pillar system. More aspects of foreign policy will now be subject to the supranational, as opposed to intergovernmental, institutions.<ref name="BBC Reform">{{cite web|title=EU leaders agree on reform treaty|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6232540.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref><ref name="Europa Lisbon treaty">{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/glance/index_en.htm|title= Treaty of Lisbon at a glance |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>

==Justice, freedom and security==
{{see|Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom & Security}}
[[Image:SchengenGrenzeBayern-Tirol.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Schengen Agreement]] has ensured open borders between most member states. (Austro-German border)]]

Much of the EU's competence in the justice and home affairs area originates from the signing of the [[Schengen Agreement]] in 1985 on gradual abolition of border controls between six of the then ten European Community member states. In order to implement the Schengen Agreement, the signatory states included measures designed to compensate for the effect of reduced border controls in the areas of [[right of asylum|asylum]], immigration and criminal justice.<ref name="EC Schengen">{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33020.htm |title=The Schengen ''acquis'' and its integration into the Union |accessdate=2007-09-01 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]}}</ref> The Maastricht Treaty transferred the Schengen [[Acquis communautaire|acquis]] to the EU (title IV of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] as originally enacted).<ref name="Maastricht IV"/>

Additional competencies were assigned to the EU by the Maastricht Treaty to facilitate the freedom of movement of people by adopting common rules in civil matters, such as contract and family law. <ref name="Maastricht IV"> {{cite web |title=Maastricht Treaty |url=http://europa.eu/eur-lex/en/treaties/dat/EU_treaty.html |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> The Maastricht Treaty also introduced the concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]], which is complementary to national citizenship.<ref name="art17 Rome"> {{cite web |title=European Community consolidated treaty, (article 17), European Citizenship) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>

Amendments to these treaties by the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] added a new aim of the EU as the creation of an "area of Justice, Freedom and Security".<ref name="art1(3) Amsterdam"> {{cite web |title=Amsterdam treaty article 1 s.3 amending European Union consolidated treaty article 2, creating an area of freedom and justice) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> That treaty also made it easier to pass laws in the justice and home affairs area and more difficult for member states to veto them. It also increased the powers of the European Parliament in relation to Justice and Home affairs' measures, with decisions in certain matters coming to be decided by [[Codecision procedure|codecision]]. Recent legislation includes the [[European Arrest Warrant]]<ref>{{cite web |title=European arrest warrant replaces extradition between EU Member States |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> and directives on family law.<ref>Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of [[27 November]] [[2003]] concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility.</ref> 

The EU has established agencies to co-ordinate its actions in the justice and home affairs area: [[Europol]] for co-operation of police forces,<ref>{{cite web |title=European police office now in full swing |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/police/europol/fsj_police_europol_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> [[Eurojust]] for co-operation between prosecutors,<ref>{{cite web |title=Eurojust coordinating cross-border prosecutions at EU level |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/eurojust/fsj_criminal_eurojust_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> and [[Frontex]] for co-operation between border control authorities.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Frontex? |url=http://www.frontex.europa.eu/ |author=[[Frontex]] |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> The EU also operates the [[Schengen Information System]]<ref name="Internal borders">{{cite web |title=Abolition of internal borders and creation of a single Union external frontier |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |date=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/freetravel/frontiers/fsj_freetravel_schengen_en.htm |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities.

===Fundamental rights===
The EU has developed a role in [[human rights]] protection. Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.<ref name="art39/141 Rome"> {{cite web |title=European Community consolidated treaty, (articles 39 and 141), prohibition of national or sexual discrimination) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> The Amsterdam Treaty supplemented these, by supporting further legislation against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age and sexual orientation.<ref name="art2(7) Amsterdam"> {{cite web |title=Amsterdam treaty article 2 s.7 amending European Community consolidated treaty article 13, combatting discrimination) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Using these powers the EU has enacted legislation on [[Sexism|sexual discrimination]] in the work-place, [[Ageism|age discrimination]] and [[Racism|racial discrimination]].<ref>Council Directive 2000/43/EC of [[29 June]] [[2000]] implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of [[27 November]] [[2000]] establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16–22).</ref> All EU states have abolished [[capital punishment]] for all crimes and the EU has been a prominent campaigner for global abolition.<ref name="DP">{{cite web|title=Launching the European Day against the Death Penalty|date=[[2007-06-19]]|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/850|accessdate = 2007-11-12 }}</ref>

Signing the 1950 [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership, however the institutions of the EU are not covered by this. As the EU was not capable of signing the ECHR without a treaty change, the EU drew up the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]]. The charter consolidated not only the rights of the ECHR but those of other UN and EU agreements, covering economic, political and social rights including "third generation" rights such as good governance and a clean environment. Although it was proclaimed in 2000, it has no legal force at present (2007).<ref name="Justice CFR">{{cite web|title =EU Charter of Fundamental Rights FAQ|publisher= EU charter website (funded by European commission)| author=[[JUSTICE]] |url=http://www.eucharter.org/home.php?page_id=66|accessdate = 2008-02-28 }}</ref> Under the Reform Treaty, the Charter would become legally binding and the EU would accede to the ECHR,<ref name="BBC Lisbon Q&A">{{cite web|title=Q&A: The Lisbon Treaty|date=[[2007-10-19]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6901353.stm|accessdate = 2007-11-12 }}</ref> which would make the [[European Court of Human Rights]], currently totally separate from the EU, the highest court in the EU for Human Rights, above the EU's Court of Justice.

The foreign relations of the EU are primarily dealt with through the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Co-operation in international trade negotiations, under the Common Commercial Policy, dates back to the establishment of the Community in 1957.<ref>{{cite web |title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy |url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-09-03 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] }}</ref> The CFSP itself has its origins in the formation of [[European Political Cooperation|European Political Co-operation]] in 1970.<ref name="EPC">{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |title=European political co-operation (EPC) |accessdate=2007-09-03 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=The European commission |work= Europa Glossary }}</ref> European Political Co-operation was an informal consultation process between member states on foreign policy matters, with the aim of forming common policies.

The Maastricht Treaty gives the Common Foreign and Security Policy the aims of promoting both the EU's own interests and those of the [[international community]] as a whole. This includes promoting international co-operation, respect for [[human rights]], [[democracy]] and the [[rule of law]].<ref name="art11 Union"> {{cite web |title=European Union consolidated treaty, (article 11, common foreign policy) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered a major factor contributing to the reform of former Communist countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name="Enlargement voice"/> This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as "soft power", as opposed to military "hard power".<ref name="Soft Power">{{cite web|last=Bildt|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Bildt|title=Europe must keep its 'soft power'|publisher=[[Financial Times]] on [[Centre for European Reform]]|date=2005|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/bildt_ft_1june05.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> [[Prime Minister of Finland|Finnish Prime Minister]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], cited the common foreign policy as a factor why [[Finland]] is, de facto, no longer a [[neutral country]].

Besides the CFSP, the Commission also has its own representation in international organisations. This is primarily through the [[European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy|European Commissioner for External Relations]], who works alongside the High Representative.

===Humanitarian aid===
{{see|ECHO (European Commission)}}
[[Image:ECHO plane.jpg|thumb|The EU is the largest contributor of aid in the world.]]

The [[ECHO (European Commission)|European Community humanitarian aid office]], or "ECHO", provides [[humanitarian aid]] from the EU to developing countries. In 2006 its budget amounted to 671&nbsp;million euros, 48% of which went to the [[ACP countries]].<ref name="ECHO 2006">{{cite web |title=DG for humanitarian aid - ECHO, financial report 2006 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |date=2006 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/echo/pdf_files/financial_report.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> Counting the EU's own contributions and those of its member states together, the EU is the largest aid donor in the world.<ref name="Aid Consensus">{{cite web |title=Commission calls for a European consensus to boost impact of humanitarian aid |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |date=[[2007-06-13]] |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/814&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

The EU's aid has previously been criticised by the eurosceptic think-tank [[Open Europe]] for being inefficient, mis-targeted and linked to economic objectives.<ref name="BBC Aid Inefficient">{{cite web|last=Mulvey|first=Stephen |title=EU attacked for 'inefficient' aid |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2007-05-30]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6705773.stm |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> 
Furthermore, some charities have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees. Under the de-inflated figures, the EU did not reach its internal aid target in 2006<ref name="Indy Inflated Aid">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Jerome |title=EU accused of artificially inflating its aid figures |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2007-05-11]] |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/eu-accused-of-artificially-inflating-its-aid-figures-448343.html |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> and the EU would not reach the international target of 0.7% of [[Measures of national income and output|GNP]] until 2015.

Member states are responsible for their own territorial defence. Many EU members are also members of [[NATO]]. The [[Western European Union]] (WEU) is a European security organisation related to the EU. In 1992, the WEU's relationship with the EU was defined, when the EU assigned it the "[[Petersberg tasks]]" (humanitarian missions such as peacekeeping and crisis management). These tasks were later transferred from the WEU to the EU by the Amsterdam Treaty; they formed part of the new CFSP and the [[European Security and Defence Policy]]. Elements of the WEU are currently being merged into the EU's CFSP, and the President of the WEU is currently CFSP High Representative.<ref name="Europa ESDP">{{cite web|title=EU Security Police & the role of the European Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/esdp/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref><ref name="Europa Chronology">{{cite web|title=EU Security Police & the role of the European Commission: Chronology|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/esdp/chrono.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO." To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the [[Helsinki Headline Goal]] process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the [[European Union Battlegroups|EU Battlegroups]] initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 men.<ref name="Council Capabilities">{{cite web|title=Military Capabilities|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[Council of the European Union]] |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=1349&lang=EN |accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> EU forces have been deployed on [[peacekeeping]] missions from [[Africa]] to the former [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Middle East]].<ref name="Council Operations">{{cite web|title=EU security and defense Operations |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[Council of the European Union]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=268&lang=EN&mode=g |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the [[European Defence Agency]], [[European Union Satellite Centre|satellite centre]] and the [[European Union Military Staff|military staff]].<ref name="Council Structures">{{cite web|title=ESPD Structures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[Council of the European Union]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=279&lang=EN&mode=g|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

===Single market===
{{see|Four Freedoms (European Union)}}
The Treaty of Rome originally created a European Economic Community. This outlined the staged development of a [[single market]], starting with the introduction of a [[customs union]] between the signatories. This became the European Community, one part of the European Union, which still has a primary task of  creating and maintaining the single market. In particular it seeks to guarantee [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|four freedoms]], which relate to ensuring the free movement of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[Citizenship of the European Union|people]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] within the area.<ref name="Europa Single Market">{{cite web|title=The Single Market|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

The principle of free movement of goods ensures goods can be taken anywhere within the whole market without being subject to barriers or obstacles. This freedom has both an internal and external dimension. Internally, goods must not be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or measures restricting import quantities between member countries. Externally, goods entering the internal market will be granted freedom after paying the Common Customs Tariff.

[[Image:Pasas2008.gif|thumb|130px|left| The EU has introduced a standardised passport design with a varying national emblem at the centre<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/2333/ |title=New-generation passports to appear in Lithuania starting New Years |publisher=|accessdate = 2008-03-17}}</ref>]]

Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.<ref name="Europa Single Market C">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Capital|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Until the drive towards Economic and Monetary Union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgments regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as that it is granted equally to non-member countries.

The free movement of persons means [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens]] can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.  This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.<ref name="Europa Single Market P">{{cite web|title=Living and working in the Single Market| publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm| author=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Traditionally the economically active were granted a much greater level of freedom than others. The extension to the non-economically active was first recognised in 1999 when the concept of Community Citizenship was introduced to the EU. In addition to extending the scope of the free movement of persons, it also grants certain social and political rights to the citizens of the EU.

The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states in order to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. Services account for between sixty and seventy percent of GDP, although legislation is not as developed as in other sectors. This has  been addressed by the recently passed [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which aims to liberalise this area of the market.<ref name="Europa Single Market S">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Services|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm| author=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.

The freedoms are not absolute in nature. Member states may interfere with their exercise on the specific grounds laid down in the Treaty, or can rely on the case law of the European Courts for more general justifications. For example, the Treaty allows member states to restrict movements that would pose a real threat to public policy or public security. In the absence of Community legislation it is for the member states to decide the scope of the exceptions. The European Courts will arbitrate as to whether the actions of the member state are proportionate and in conformity with Community law.  The freedoms are extended to the non-member states of [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]] via the [[European Economic Area]].<ref name="EEA">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/eea/index.htm| title =The European Economic Area (EEA)|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |accessdate = 2007-07-21}}</ref>Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.<ref name="Europa Single Market G">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for goods|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

===Monetary union===
{{see|Euro|Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union}}
[[Image:Eurotower-ffm005.jpg|thumb|The [[European Central Bank]] in [[Frankfurt]] governs [[Eurozone]] monetary policy]] 

A [[monetary union|single currency]] for the EU has been an official objective since 1969 and work began in 1990 on [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]. Nine years later the [[euro]] was [[Introduction of the euro|launched in eleven]] of the then fifteen member states as an accounting currency, meaning that national currencies remained in use but with exchange rates locked to the euro.  On [[1 January]] [[2002]], euro notes and coins were issued and the national currencies were phased out. [[Eurozone]] membership increased to twelve in 2002 and now fifteen countries use the euro as their sole official currency. [[Slovenia]] adopted the Euro on the [[1 January]] [[2007]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]] on the [[1 January]] [[2008]]. All other  EU members except Denmark and the United Kingdom have agreed to join as a condition of being members of the EU and  dates for this will be set when economic conditions have been met. Public opinion in Denmark currently favours joining. Sweden has pointedly failed to take necessary economic steps.  A number of other countries outside the EU, such as [[Montenegro]], also use the euro unofficially.<ref name="euro use world">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/the_euro/euro_in_world9369_en.htm| title=

The euro is designed to help build the single market by, for example: easing travel of citizens and goods, eliminating exchange rate problems, providing price transparency, creating a single financial market, price stability, low interest rates, having a currency used internationally and protected against shocks by the large amount of internal trade within the eurozone. It is also intended as a political symbol of integration and stimulus for more.<ref name="euro website"/> In recent years [[Foreign exchange reserves|holdings]] of the euro have grown, and there is some speculation that if the eurozone continues to enlarge, and/or the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] continues to fall, the euro could become the main world [[reserve currency]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Menzie |first= Chinn |coauthors= Jeffery Frankel |year= 2006 |month= January |title= Will the Euro Eventually Surpass The Dollar As Leading International Reserve Currency? |journal=[[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] |url=http://www.wage.wisc.edu/uploads/Working%20Papers/chinnfrankel_NBER_eurotopcurrency.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 2007-10-11 }}</ref>

===Competition===

The EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.<ref>Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome</ref> The Commission as the [[competition regulator]] for the single market is responsible for [[competition law|antitrust]] issues, approving [[mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], breaking up [[cartel]]s, working for [[economic liberalism|economic liberalisation]] and preventing [[subsidy|state aid]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] author=[[European Commission]] |title=Competition: making markets work better| author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/index_en.html|accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref>

In negotiations on the Treaty of Lisbon, [[President of France|French President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] succeeded in removing the words "free and undistorted competition" from the treaties. However, the requirement is maintained in an annex and it is  unclear whether this will have any practical effect on EU policy.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title =EU competition to remain in place|date=[[2007-06-22]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6231684.stm|accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref>

===Budget===
{{see|Budget of the European Union}}
[[Image:EUexpenditure2004.png|right|300px]]

The EU had an agreed budget of €116&nbsp;billion for the year 2007, and €862&nbsp;billion for the period 2007-2013;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_glance/where_from_en.htm| title=EU budget at a glance|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> this represents around 1% of the EU's combined [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. By comparison, the UK's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759&nbsp;billion, and France was estimated to have spent €801&nbsp;billion. In 1960, the then "EU" ([[EEC]]) budget was 0.03% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euro-know.org/articles/wew.html |title=Will Europe Work? |publisher=Euro-know |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref>

The largest single expenditure item is the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) at around 45% of the total budget. The second largest element is the [[Regional policy of the European Union|regional policy]], at 30%. Foreign policy consumes 8%, administration 6%, research 5%.

==Development policy==
===Agriculture===
{{main|Common Agricultural Policy}}

The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) is one the oldest policies of the European Community and was one of its core aims.<ref name="stead">{{cite web|last=Stead|first=David|coauthors=Robert Whaples (eds)|title=Common Agricultural Policy|publisher=EH.Net Encyclopedia|date=[[2007-06-22]]|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Stead.CAP |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers (article 33 of the Treaty of Rome).<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s the policy accounted for over 60% of the then [[European Community]]'s annual budget, and still accounts for around 35%.<ref name="stead"/>

[[Image:ClosLaPlanaEdit.jpg|thumb|left|EU farms are supported by the [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]], the largest [[Budget of the European Union|budgetary]] expenditure (Vinyard in Spain).]]

The policy's price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction, resulting in so-called ''butter mountains'' and ''wine lakes''. These were [[Intervention storage|intervention stores]] of produce bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. In order to dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their produce outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers in the developing world.<ref name="Guardian CAP">{{cite web|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|title=The EU common agricultural policy|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-06-26]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/26/eu.politics1 |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The overproduction has also been criticised on environmental grounds in that it encourages environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/> Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living, in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life. However, the EU's small farmers only receive 8% of CAP's available subsidies.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/>

Since the beginning of the 1990s the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially these reforms included the introduction of [[Set-aside]] in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). It is intended to move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to have the effect of allowing the market to dictate production levels while maintaining agricultural income levels.<ref name="stead"/> The most recent reform entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime which previously involved the carving up of the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.<ref name="EC CAP">{{cite web |title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |date=[[2007-04-14]] |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>

===Energy===
{{main|Energy policy of the European Union}}
[[Image:RF NG pipestoEU.gif|thumb|upright|Many EU members import oil and gas from Russia.]]

The EU has been a legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence: this has its roots in the original [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.<ref name="Energy Q&A">{{cite web|title=Q&A: EU energy plans |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2007-03-09]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4783996.stm|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

The Commission has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between [[Electricity distribution|electricity grid]]s; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in [[Central Asia]] and [[North Africa]]; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing use of renewable energy; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.<ref name="Energy Q&A"/>

The EU currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], making it the world's leading importer of these fuels.<ref name="low carb prop">{{cite web|title='Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/ |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> There are concerns that the EU is largely dependent on other countries, primarily [[Russia]], for its energy. This concern has grown following a series of [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute|clashes]] between Russia and its neighbours, threatening the flow of gas. As a result the EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply.<ref name="Energy Russia">{{cite web |title=Ukraine-Russia gas dispute &ndash; call for stronger EU energy policy |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060112STO04233&secondRef=0|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
{{see|European Commissioner for Transport|European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry}}<!--Galileo comes under the latter, not Transport-->
[[Image:Oresundsbroen HCS.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Infrastructure, such as the [[Oresund Bridge]] between Denmark and Sweden, is a priority to increase trade and mobility.]]

The EU is working to improve cross-border [[infrastructure]] within the EU, for example through the [[Trans-European Networks]] (TEN). Projects under TEN include the [[Channel Tunnel]], [[LGV Est]], the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]], the [[Oresund Bridge]] and the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]]. In 2001 it was estimated that by 2010 the network would cover: 75,200&nbsp;km of roads; 78,000&nbsp;km of railways; 330 airports; 270 maritime harbours; and 210 internal harbours.<ref>{{cite web|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=[[2003-10-01]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ten/transport/revision/doc/revision_1692_memo_en.pdf| format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-15 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mirea|first=Silvia|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|publisher=The Railway Journal|url=http://www.cfr.ro/jf/engleza/0304/ten-t.htm|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Paper on Transport|publisher=Euractiv |date=[[2004-09-22]]|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/white-paper-transport/article-129628 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> The [[Roads and expressways in Poland|Polish road network]] in particular was in poor condition: at Poland's accession to the EU, 4,600 roads needed to be upgraded to EU standards, demanding approximately 17&nbsp;billion euros.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transport – How Quickly will Polish Roads Improve After Accession|publisher=Urząd Komitetu Integracji Europejskiej|date=[[2003-05-29]]|url=http://www.ukie.gov.pl/WWW/en.nsf/0/574AB36381D2F551C1256E82004F9470?Open|format=|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

Another infrastructure project is the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]]. Galileo is a proposed [[Global Navigation Satellite System]], to be built by the EU and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and is to be operational by 2010. The Galileo project was launched to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated [[Global Positioning System]], which will extend to nations outside the EU.<ref name="Barrot">{{cite web |last=Barrot |first=Jacques |title=Jacques Barrot Home Page, Commission vice president for transport|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/barrot/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> It has been criticised by some due to costs, delays, and the perception of redundancy due to the existing GPS system.<ref>{{cite web|last=McKie| first=Robin| title=Sat-nav rival could crash and burn|publisher=[[The Guardian]]| date=[[2007-07-15]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/jul/15/spaceexploration.europeanunion|accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref>

20% of the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|world's busiest airports]] are located in the EU, including the five terminal [[London Heathrow Airport]] which serves almost 70 million passengers per year, and is the world's busiest for international passengers. Other major airports in the EU include: [[Charles de Gaulle International Airport]], [[Frankfurt Airport]], [[Madrid Barajas International Airport]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], [[London Gatwick Airport]] and [[Munich Airport]].

There are substantial economical disparities across the EU. Even corrected for purchasing power, the difference between the richest and poorest regions (NUT-2 and NUT-3 of the [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]]) is about a factor of ten. On the high end [[Frankfurt]] has €68,751 [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] per capita, [[Paris]] €67,980, and [[Inner London]] €65,138, while [[Nord-Est (development region)|Romania's Nord-Est]] has €5,070 PPP per capita and [[Bulgaria]]'s Severozapaden has €5,502 PPP per capita.<ref name="London_Nord-Est_Severozapaden">{{cite web|title=Regional GDP per inhabitant in the EU 27|author=[[Eurostat]]  |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PGP_PRD_CAT_PREREL/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2007/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2007_MONTH_02/1-19022007-EN-AP.PDF|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> Compared to the EU average, the United States GDP per capita is 35% higher and the Japanese GDP per capita is approximately 15% higher.<ref name="STAT/06/166">{{cite web |title=GDP per capita in the Member States ranged from 48% to 251% of the EU25 average in 2005 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|author=[[Eurostat]] |date=[[2006-12-18]] |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT/06/166&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

There are a number of [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds]] to support development of underdeveloped regions of the EU.

The first environmental policy of the European Community was launched in 1972. Since then it has addressed issues such as [[acid rain]], the thinning of the [[ozone layer]], [[Air Quality Index|air quality]], [[noise pollution]], [[waste]] and [[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union|water pollution]]. The [[Water framework directive]] is an example of a water policy, aiming for rivers, lakes, ground and coastal waters to be of "good quality" by 2015.

{{see|Educational policies and initiatives of the European Union|Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development}}
[[Image:Windkraftanlagen Dänemark gross.jpg|thumb|[[Renewable energy]] is one priority in transnational research activities such as the [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]].]]

Education and science are areas where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In education, the policy was mainly developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[ERASMUS programme]], a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20&nbsp;years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5&nbsp;million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th anniversary |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}; {{cite web|last=Jean-Sébastien|first=Lefebvre |title=Erasmus turns 20 - time to grow up? |date=[[2007-01-22]]|publisher=Café Babel |url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=9702 |accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref> There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.<ref>{{cite web |author=EACEA |title=About the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency  |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm |accessdate=2007-07-21}}; {{cite web |title=Lifelong Learning Programme |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> Through its support of the [[Bologna process]] the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.

Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent [[European Research Council]] allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the ERC? |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| author=[[European Research Council]]  |url=http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&topicID=12 |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The [[Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)]] deals in a number of areas, for example energy where it aims to develop a diverse mix of [[renewable energy]] for the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Energy|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm?pg=energy |accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref>

Since January 2000 the [[European Commission]] has set its sights on a more ambitious objective, known as the [[European Research Area]], and has extensively funded research in a few key areas. This has the support of all member states, and extends the existing financing structure of the frameworks. It aims to focus on co-ordination, sharing knowledge, ensuring mobility of researchers around Europe, improving conditions for researchers and encouraging links with business and industry as well as removing any legal and administrative barriers.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the European Research Area? |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The EU is involved with six other countries to develop [[ITER]], a [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] [[nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] which will be built in the EU at [[Cadarache]].

German is the most widely spoken mother tongue (about 88.7&nbsp;million people [[2006|as of 2006]]), followed by English, French, and Italian. English is by far the most spoken foreign language at over half (51%) of the population, with German and French following. 56% of European citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue.<ref name="Eurobarometer Languages">{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Survey)|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|date=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf| format=PDF |accessdate=2007-02-03}}<br />{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Executive Summary)|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|date=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> Most official languages of the EU belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]], except Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, which belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family, and Maltese, which is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]].

Besides the 23 official languages, there are about 150 [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language]]s, spoken by up to 50&nbsp;million people.<ref name="Many tongues, one family"/> Of these, only the Spanish regional languages ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) can be used in communication with the Council of the European Union, the Commission, the Economic and Social Committee, the European Parliament, the [[European Ombudsman]] and the [[Committee of the Regions]].<ref name="Mercator">{{cite web|title=Mercator Newsletter - n. 29|publisher=Mercator Central|date=2006|url=http://www.mercator-central.org/newsletter/newsletter29.htm#2|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref> Although EU programmes can support regional and minority languages, the protection of [[linguistic rights]] is a matter for the individual member states.

Besides the many regional languages, a broad variety of languages from other parts of the world are spoken by [[immigration|immigrant]] communities in the member states: [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Maghrebi Arabic]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Modern Standard Hindi|Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkan languages]] are spoken in many parts of the EU. Many older immigrant communities are [[Multilingualism|bilingual]], being fluent in both the local (EU) language and in that of their ancestral community. Migrant languages have no formal status or recognition in the EU or in the EU countries, although from 2007 they are eligible for support from the language teaching section of the EU's [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]].<ref name="Many tongues, one family"/>

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in the European Union}}

The EU is a [[secularity|secular]] body, with no formal connections to any [[religion]] and no mention of religion in any current or proposed treaty.<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention [[Christianity]] and/or [[God]] in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.<ref name="EUO Merkel God">{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/eu-celebrates-its-50th-birthday--with-a-row-about-religion-440976.html |title=EU celebrates 50th birthday-with a row about religion | publisher= [[The Independent]] |first=Stephen |last=Castle |date=2007-03-21| accessdate=2008-03-04 }}</ref>
 
[[Image:EU belief in god.png|thumb|left|Percentage of Europeans in each Member State who believe in a god.<!---"a god" lowercase as it is not a specific god (i.e. The Christian God)--->]]

Emphasis on Christianity stems from this being the dominant [[Religion in Europe|religion in Europe]], and thus of the EU. It divides between [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], a wide range of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches (especially in northern Europe) and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] (in south eastern Europe). Other religions such as [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] are also represented in the EU population; in 2002 the EU had an estimated [[Jewish population]] of over a million<ref>Jewish population figures may be unreliable. These estimates are taken from: {{cite web| url = http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/concepts/demography/demjpop.html | title = World Jewish Population (2002)| accessdate = 2007-05-03| author = Sergio DellaPergola| work = American Jewish Year Book| publisher = The Jewish Agency for Israel}}</ref> and a Muslim population in 2006 of 16&nbsp;million people.<ref name="Islam.de SecE">{{cite web|title=In Europa leben gegen­wärtig knapp 53&nbsp;millionen Muslime|publisher=Islam.de|date=[[2006-02-25]]|url=http://islam.de/8368.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

Findings by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency which monitors the religious beliefs of EU citizens as part of its [[Eurobarometer]] opinion polls, show that the majority of EU citizens have some form of belief system but that only 21% see it as important. There is increasing [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]] among the general population in Europe, with falling church attendance and membership in many countries.<ref name="About SecE">{{cite web |publisher=[[USA Today]] |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-02-21-god-europe_x.htm |title=What place for God in Europe |accessdate=2008-03-04 |date=2005-02-22 |first=Peter |last=Ford}}</ref> The 2005 Eurobarometer showed that of the European citizens (of the 25 members at that time), 52% believed in ''a'' god, 27% in ''some sort of spirit or life force'' and 18% had no form of belief.

Across the EU, belief was higher among women, increased with age, those with religious upbringing, those with the lowest levels of formal education, those leaning towards [[right-wing politics]], and those reflecting more upon philosophical and ethical issues.<ref name="Eurostat Religion"/>

==Cultural policy==
{{see|Culture of Europe|Cultural policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:Liverpool 2008 Flag.jpg|thumb|[[Liverpool]] is one of the two [[European Capital of Culture|European Capitals of Culture]] for 2008.]]
EU culture is intertwined with the [[culture of Europe]] and its specific national heritages;  policies affecting cultural matters are mainly set by individual member states. 
Cultural co-operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref name="Bozoki">{{cite web |last=Bozoki |first=Andras |title=Cultural Policy and Politics in the European Union |publisher=IECOB, Institute for Central Eastern and Balkan Europe |url=http://137.204.115.130/activities/download/Bozoki/Cultural%20Policy%20and%20Politics%20in%20the%20European%20Union.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme,<ref name="Bozoki"/> the [[European Cultural Month]] event,<ref name="Culture Month">{{cite web |title=European Culture Month |author=[[European Commission]]|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/ecocs/present_cap/retrospective_en.html |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> the [[Media Plus]] programme,<ref name="Media Plus">{{cite web |title=Media programme |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |date=[[2007-07-05]] |author=[[European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/media/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> orchestras such as the [[European Union Youth Orchestra]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euyo.org.uk/about/history.htm |title=An Overture to the European Union Youth Orchestra |publisher=The European Youth Orchestra |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> and the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme &ndash; where one or more cities in the EU are selected for one year to assist the cultural development of that city.<ref name="Capital Culture">{{cite web| title=European Capitals of Culture |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/ecocs/present_cap/present_cap_en.html |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>
In addition, the EU gives grants to cultural projects (totalling 233 in 2004) and has launched a Web portal dedicated to Europe and culture, responding to the European Council's expressed desire to see the Commission and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means."<ref name="Culture Portal">{{cite web |title=Cultural heritage as a vehicle of cultural identity |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]

Within the EU, supporters of [[European integration]] often appeal to a shared European historical/cultural heritage, typically including [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], the [[feudalism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], 19th century [[Liberalism]] and (sometimes) negative elements such as the [[World war]]s. European values are assumed to be grounded in this shared heritage.<ref>For example: {{cite web | url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20070208IPR02888| title =Priority is dialogue for partnership and tolerance | accessdate = 2008-02-27 | author = Hans-Gert Poettering| authorlink = Hans-Gert Pöttering| date = 2007-02-13 | work = Inaugural speech by the new president of the European Parliament | publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]], [[European parliament]] | quote = }}</ref>

===Sport===
{{see|Sport in Europe|Sport policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:Campnoumatch.jpg|thumb|Spectator sports are popular in many EU member states ([[Camp Nou]], [[Barcelona]])]]

Sport is mainly the responsibility of individual states or other international organisations rather than that of the EU. However, some EU policies have had an impact on sport, such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]], which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.<ref name="BBC Boseman">{{cite web|last=Fordyce|first=Tom|title=10&nbsp;years since Bosman |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Under the proposed [[Treaty of Lisbon]] sports would be given a special status which would exempt this sector from much of the EU's economic rules. This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[FIFA]], due to objections over the applications of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.<ref name="IHT RT">{{cite web| title=IOC, FIFA presidents welcomes new EU treaty, call it breakthrough to give sports more power|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2007-10-19]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/19/sports/EU-SPT-OLY-EU-Treaty.php |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> 

Several European sports associations are consulted in the formulation of the EU's sports policy, including [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]], [[UEFA]], [[European Handball Federation|EHF]], [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]], [[FIRA - Association of European Rugby|FIRA]] and [[Confédération Européenne de Volleyball|CEV]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Statement of European team sports |publisher=UEFA.com|date=[[2007-10-19]]|url=http://www.uefa.com/multimediafiles/download/uefa/keytopics/560675_download.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> All EU member states and their respective national sport associations are participating in European sport organisations such as [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA |publisher=UEFA.com|date=[[2007-10-19]] |url=http://www.uefa.com/ |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref>
