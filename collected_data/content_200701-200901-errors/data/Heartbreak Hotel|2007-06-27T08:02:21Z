"'''Heartbreak Hotel'''" is a [[rock and roll]] song by [[Elvis Presley]], with [[Bill Black]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]), [[Scotty Moore]] ([[guitar]]), [[D.J. Fontana]] ([[drums]]), [[Floyd Cramer]] ([[piano]]) and Elvis on rhythm guitar as the main supporting musicians.   Recorded in January [[1956]] in Nashville, the song introduced Presley to the [[United States|American]] national [[music]] consciousness.  It was released as a [[single (music)|single]] with the b-side song "I Was The One" on [[January 27]] [[1956]]. "Heartbreak Hotel" became the first No.1 pop record by Elvis and went on to be 1956's biggest selling single.<ref name="first">{{cite book

It was written by Thomas Durden, then a steel-guitarist in Smiling Jack Herring and his Swing Billies,[http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,258803,00.html] and Mae Boren Axton, a teacher at Dupont Jr.-Sr. High School in Jacksonville, Florida, and the mother of singer/songwriter/actor [[Hoyt Axton]]. Durden read about a suicide in the Miami Herald in 1955. A well-dressed man had removed all labels from his clothing, destroyed his identity papers and left a note saying: "I walk a lonely street." [http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,258803,00.html]

"Heartbreak Hotel" was produced by [[Steve Sholes]] who used a hallway at the studio to get an unusual echo for the single. "Heartbreak Hotel"'s lyrical matter deals with the singer's [[sadness]], implicitly that following the end of a [[romantic love|romantic]] relationship. It uses the [[metaphor]] of a [[hotel]] to represent this emotional state. 

The song was later ranked #45 on [[Rolling Stone]]'s list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] and is a Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 1956, Presley sang the song live and introduced it at the Tommy Dorsey TV Show, on February 11.  He also sang it on March 1 and March 24 of that year, and on his third and last appearance at the Ed Sullivan Show, also on CBS, on January 6, 1957. Cumulative viewers for these first television performances are estimated at over 60 million. In 1968, he also sang it on his celebrated "Comeback TV Special", in a medley with [[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]] and [[All Shook Up]].  Because the vocals on the original record featured heavy use of [[reverb]], the song was immediately lampooned in radio humorist [[Stan Freberg]]'s parody of the song, where the lead singer repeatedly asks for "more echo on [his] voice." The song is an example of [[simple verse form]] based on the [[eight-bar blues]] progression. 

There is now a real [[hotel]] named after the song, and [http://maps.google.com/local?q=Heartbreak+Hotel+loc%3A+Memphis+TN&f=l&hl=en&latlng=35149444,-90048889,14374206154072421495 located] across from Graceland, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].    

A [[Heartbreak Hotel (film)|movie with the same title]], based on a mythical incident involving the kidnapping of Elvis Presley, was released theatrically in 1988. It starred [[David Keith]] as Elvis Presley, and [[Tuesday Weld]] and was directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]].

There are numerous cover versions of the song, including one by avant garde musician [[John Cale]], although the mood of the song was significantly more unsettling than Elvis's version.  [[Tommy Emmanuel]] has recently included this song into his repertoire and only involves him on lead guitar and vocals. 

[[Dread Zeppelin]], a reggae band fronted by an Elvis impersonator, does a medley of "Heartbreak Hotel" and [[Led Zeppelin| Led Zeppelin's]] [[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)| Heartbreaker]] entitled [[Heartbreaker (At the End of Lonely Street)]]. This tune appears on [[Un-Led-Ed]] and [[Deja Voodoo]].

Three other songs, also entitled "Heartbreak Hotel" were released as singles, one by [[The Jackson Five|The Jacksons]] (later renamed "[[This Place Hotel]]"), a second by [[Whitney Houston]], whose mother, gospel singer [[Cissy Houston]] performed in several Elvis recordings, both in the studio and live, as a member of the [[Sweet Inspirations.]] A third song called "Heartbreak Hotel" was performed by [[Caroline MÃ¼ller|C. C. Catch]]. None of these songs are connected to Elvis's song.

[[U2 (band)|U2]] wrote a song called "A Room At The Heartbreak Hotel." It is a [[A-side and B-side|b-side]] to their "[[Angel of Harlem]]" single, released in 1988. It was also covered by [[Hugh Jackman]] for the 2006 animated film ''[[Happy Feet]]'' where it mixed with [[Nicole Kidman]]'s voice singing [[Kiss (song)|Kiss]].
