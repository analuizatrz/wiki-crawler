'''''Parineeta''''' ([[Hindi]]: परिणीता, [[Urdu]]: پرنیتا, translation: ''The Married Woman'') is a [[Bollywood]] [[Musical film|musical]] adaptation of the [[1914]] [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[novella]], ''[[Parineeta]]'' by [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]. Directed by debutant [[Pradeep Sarkar]], based upon a screenplay by [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]], the movie featured [[Saif Ali Khan]] as Shekhar, [[Sanjay Dutt]] as Girish, [[Vidya Balan]] as Lalita, and [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as the narrator.

This movie was well received all over [[India]] and abroad <ref>http://planetbollywood.com/Film/Parineeta/</ref>.

==Plot==

This film adaptation of [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]'s 1914 novella, ''[[Parineeta]]'', places the story in [[Kolkata]] of 1962. This adaptation (which deviates slightly from the original storyline of the novella <ref>http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2215/stories/20050729001908300.htm</ref>) centers around a young woman, Lalita ([[Vidya Balan]]), who was orphaned as a child.  She lives with the family of her uncle, Gurucharan ([[Achyut Potdar]]). Gurucharan has a daughter, Koel ([[Raima Sen]]), who is very close to Lalita.
When Gurucharan had a heart attack three years prior, he had to borrow a large sum of money from his neighbor, Navin Rai ([[Sabyasachi Chakravarthy]]). Rai demands that Gurucharan return the loan or else he will lose his home to Rai (a situation which creates the central tension of the film).
Rai's son, Shekhar ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) is rebellious and musically inclined, spending his days playing the music of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] or [[Elvis Presley]] and composing his own songs with Lalita, rather than becoming part of his father's world.  Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantia ([[Dia Mirza]]), the beautiful but devious daughter of a wealthy family whom his father would like Shekhar to marry into. Instead, Shekhar is in love with Lalita, and she with him, though neither of them admit it. 

Meanwhile, Lalita meets a relative by marriage, Charu's ([[Smita Malhotra]]) brother, Girish ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), who is visiting from [[London]]. Girish falls in love with Lalita as well. The resulting love triangle, and Navin Rai's deviousness, forms the climax of the film.

==Cultural allusions==
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:ParineetacapSwing.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Vidya Balan]] (Lalita) singing "Phool Phool" on her swing in an [[homage]] to [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[Charulata]]''  {{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 23 July 2007}}]] -->
Cinematic works by [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] (such as ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'') often contain [[allusion]]s to other important films and works of literature.  [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]], the author of ''[[Parineeta]]'', was a contemporary of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]; both authors documented Bengali life and social issues at the turn of the century.  The 2005 cinematic version of ''Parineeta'' pays [[homage]] to this relationship by referencing [[Satyajit Ray]]'s film ''[[Charulata]]'', which itself is based upon Tagore's noted novella, ''[[Nashtanir]]''. ''Parineeta'' 's Lalita is dressed to resemble ''Nashtanir''/''Charulata'' 's Charu ([[Madhabi Mukherjee]]), particularly during the song "[[Soona Man Ka Aangan]]", which incorporates Tagore's song "Fule Fule Dhole Dhole." In both ''Parineeta'' and ''Charulata'', "Fule Fule Dhole Dhole" is sung while Lalita and Charu are each on a swing <ref>http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050611/asp/nation/story_4854277.asp</ref>, <ref>http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mag/2005/08/07/stories/2005080700510500.htm</ref>. The film continues the above connection by placing [[Saif Ali Khan]] on the same train used in the film ''[[Aradhana (1969 Hindi Film)|Aradhana]]'' which featured his mother, [[Sharmila Tagore]] (a relative of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and a favorite actress of [[Satyajit Ray]]) <ref>http://in.rediff.com/movies/2004/dec/23saif.htm</ref>.
