The spider family '''Hexathelidae''', the only family in the super-family '''Hexatheloidea''', is one of two families (along with ''[[Funnel-web tarantula|Dipluridae]]'') of spiders known as '''funnel-web tarantulas'''.  This order is sometimes referred to as the '''venomous funnel-web tarantulas''', due to the inclusion of the [[Australasian funnel-web spider]]s, including the notorious ''[[Atrax robustus]]'', or Sydney funnel-web spider, but most specimens in Hexathelidae are not dangerous to humans. 

== Description ==
[[Image:BlackTunnelweb.JPG|thumb|left|250px|male ''[[Porrhothele antipodiana]]'']]
[[Image:Victorian funnelweb.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Hadronyche modesta]]'', the harmless<ref>[http://museumvictoria.com.au/DiscoveryCentre/Infosheets/Spiders-found-in-Victoria/Victorian-Funnel-web-Spider/ Museum Victoria: Victorian Funnel-web Spider<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Victorian funnelweb spider]]

These spiders are medium-to-large in size, with body lengths ranging from 1 cm to 5 cm (0.4 to 2 inches). The body is typically three times longer than it is wide. They are darkly colored, ranging from black to brown, with a glossy carapace covering the front part of the body. Like the related [[Funnel-web tarantula|diplurid]] spiders, the hexathelids have generally long [[spinneret]]s; this is especially true of ''A. robustus''.  The eyes of these spiders are close together.

Their long posterior [[spinneret]]s and other features make the Hexathelidae appear similar to the [[Dipluridae]], and were considered a subfamily of the latter until 1980<ref>Platnick 2008</ref>.

Like other '''Mygalomorphae''' (also called the ''Orthognatha'', an [[infraorder]] of [[spider]]s which includes the true [[tarantula]]s), these spiders have [[fang]]s which point straight down and do not cross each other (see also [[araneomorph]]).  They have ample [[poison]] glands that lie entirely within their [[chelicerae]]. Their chelicerae and fangs are large and powerful.  Although they are rather small compared to the true [[tarantula]]s, as venomous specimens they should not be handled without taking substantial precautions because their fangs have been known to penetrate fingernails and soft shoes, resulting in dangerous bites{{Fact|date=March 2008}}.

==Range and habitat==
Most hexathelids are found in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Asia]]. One species is known for the [[Mediterranean]] region and two from [[South America]]. Two species occur in [[Central Africa]].

Hexathelids typically live in burrows, which are constructed in the ground or in tree hollows.  An elaborately constructed burrow entrance is common.  These spiders construct a [[funnel]] shaped [[spider web|web]] and lurk for [[prey]] in the small end of the funnel. They frequently search for a place to nest under [[house|human dwellings]], or under nearby [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[log]]s, or other similar objects. They are [[nocturnal|most active at night]]. 

Most species live in [[rain forest]]s, but they also occur in other habitats, from sea level to high up in the mountains<ref>Murphy & Murphy 2000: 68</ref>.

== Medical significance ==
There are three genera known to contain [[Spiders having medically significant venom|medically significant]] spiders —''[[Atrax]]'' and ''[[Hadronyche]]'' of [[Australia]] and the south Pacific, and ''[[Macrothele]]'', which contains some specimens considered dangerous in [[Taiwan]] and parts of eastern [[Asia]].

==Genera==
The categorization into subfamilies follows Joel Hallan.[http://insects.tamu.edu/research/collection/hallan/Acari/Family/Hexathelidae.txt]
