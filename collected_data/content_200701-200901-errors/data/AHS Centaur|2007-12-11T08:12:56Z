'''Australian Hospital Ship (AHS) ''Centaur'''''{{ref|name|[I]}} was a [[hospital ship]] active during [[World War II]], which was attacked and sunk by a Japanese submarine in 1943. Of the 332 medical personnel and crew aboard, 268 died. 

The Scottish-built vessel was launched in 1924 as a combination passenger liner/freighter and operated a trade route between [[Western Australia]] and [[Singapore]] via the island of [[Java]], carrying passengers, cargo, and livestock.<ref name="Smith9"/><ref name="Mill5-6"/> ''Centaur'' served in both civilian and military capabilities and during her career was involved in towing a damaged Japanese [[Whaler|whale-chaser]] and recovering German survivors of the [[Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran|engagement between HMAS ''Sydney'' and HSK ''Kormoran'']].<ref name="Smith13"/><ref name="Smith15"/><ref name="Mill19"/>

Following her early-1943 conversion to a hospital ship, ''Centaur'' served with the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]].<ref name="Smith23"/><ref name="Smith24"/> Before dawn on [[14 May]], [[1943]], while on her second voyage, ''Centaur'' was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by a Japanese submarine off [[North Stradbroke Island]], [[Queensland]].<ref name="Smith23"/><ref name="Stevens358"/> The majority of the 332 aboard died in the attack and the 64 survivors had to wait for 36 hours before they were rescued.<ref name="Gill258"/><ref name="Gill259"/> The attack resulted in public outrage as it was considered to be a [[war crime]].<ref name="Frame187"/> Protests were made by the Australian and British governments to Japan and efforts were made to discover the people responsible so they could be tried at a war crimes tribunal.<ref name="Mill187"/><ref name="Mill196-214"/> Despite this, it was not until 1979 that the attacking submarine, ''I-177'', was identified.<ref name="Frame188"/>

The events surrounding the sinking of ''Centaur'' are controversial because it has been attested that she may have been in breach of the international conventions that should have protected her.<ref name="Mill232"/> Efforts to locate the final resting place of the ship have been made but, in spite of a false identification made in 1995 which stood until 2003, the location of ''Centaur'' is still unknown, as is the reason for the attack.<ref name="DOD29-6-03"/>

==Design and construction==
===Original design===
In early 1923, the Ocean Steamship Company (better known as Alfred Holt's [[Blue Funnel Line]]) decided that a new vessel would be required to replace the aging ''Charon'' on the [[West Australia]] to [[Singapore]] trade route.<ref name="Smith9">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 9</ref> The vessel had to be capable of simultaneously transporting passengers, cargo, and livestock.<ref name="Smith9"/> She also had to be capable of resting on mud flats out of the water as the tidal variance in ports at the northern end of [[Western Australia]] was as great as eight metres.<ref name="Jenkins281">Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', p 281</ref>

[[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] in [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]] was chosen to construct ''Centaur''.<ref name="Smith9"/> The ship's keel was laid on [[16 November]], [[1923]], with the ship ready for collection by [[29 August]], [[1924]].<ref name="Smith9"/> ''Centaur'' was designed to carry 72 passengers and 450 cattle.<ref name="Mill5-6">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', pp 5–6</ref> Cargo was carried in four holds, and while the two decks within the hull were primarily for livestock, they could instead be used as additional cargo space.<ref name="Smith9"/><ref name="Smith22">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 22</ref> The hull of the ship was of the [[turret deck ship|'turret deck']] design; the underwater decks being wider than those above water with the reinforced flat bottom allowing the ship to rest on the bottom without damage.<ref name="Smith9"/> ''Centaur'' was amongst the first civilian vessels to be equipped with a [[diesel engine]].<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 2</ref> One of the most visible characteristics was the 35&nbsp;ft (10.5&nbsp;m) smokestack, the extreme size was more a concession to tradition than of practical advantage on a diesel-powered vessel.<ref name="Smith9"/> ''Centaur'' was constructed at a cost of £146,750 [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]].<ref name="Smith9"/>

In December 1939, ''Centaur'' underwent a minor refit in [[Hong Kong]], receiving a new propeller and having a [[supercharger]] fitted to the engine.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 14</ref> The supercharger broke down in April 1942 and could not be repaired due to wartime shortages and restricted dockyard access for non-military vessels.<ref name="Mill25">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 25</ref>

===Hospital ship refit===
[[Image:Centaur ward (AWM 029717).jpg|thumb|One of ''Centaur'''s wards shortly after her conversion to a hospital ship]]
At the beginning of 1943, ''Centaur'' was placed at the disposal of the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Australian Department of Defence]] for conversion to a [[hospital ship]].<ref name="Smith19">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 19</ref> The conversion was performed by [[United Ship Services]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], and was initially estimated to cost £20,000 [[Australian pound]]s.<ref name="Smith21">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 21</ref>

The cost increased to almost [[Australian pound|A£]]55,000, for a variety of reasons.<ref name="Smith21"/> It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in [[New Guinea]] to [[Townsville]] in [[Queensland]], Australia.<ref name="Smith21"/> Increasing casualty numbers in the [[New Guinea campaign]] meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to [[Sydney]] was required.<ref name="Smith21"/> The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities, hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a [[calorifier]], the rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions.<ref name="Smith21"/> The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved living and dining conditions, including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms.<ref name="Smith21"/>

When AHS ''Centaur'' was relaunched on [[12 March]], [[1943]], she was equipped with an operating theatre, dispensary, two wards (located on the former cattle decks), a dental surgery, along with quarters for seventy five crew and sixty five permanent Army medical staff.<ref name="Mill51">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 51</ref><ref>Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', pp 21–22</ref> To maintain the ship's mean draught of 6.1 metres, 900 kilograms of [[iron stone]] were distributed through the cargo holds as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]].<ref name="Smith21"/> AHS ''Centaur'' was capable of voyages of 18 days before resupply and could carry just over 250 [[wiktionary:bedridden|bedridden]] patients.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 40</ref>

==Operational History==
===1924 to 1938===
When ''Centaur'' entered service at the end of 1924, the [[Fremantle]]-[[Java]]-[[Singapore]] trade route was being serviced by two other [[Blue Funnel Line]] vessels; ''Gorgon'' (which remained in service until 1928) and ''Charon'' (which ''Centaur'' was replacing).<ref name="Smith13">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 13</ref> ''Centaur'''s route ran from Fremantle up the [[Western Australia]]n coast to the [[Bali Strait]], [[Surabaya]], [[Semarang]], [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and Singapore.<ref name="Jenkins281"/> During her service, ''Centaur'' filled the profiles of both a [[tramp steamer]] and a [[freight liner (ship)|freight liner]] as, while she travelled a set route, stops at ports located along that route varied between journeys.<ref name="Smith13"/> From 1928 until an unknown point in the 1930s, ''Centaur'' remained alone on her route.<ref name="Smith13"/> An increase in trade along this route prompted Blue Funnel Line to reassign ''Gorgon'' and assign the new ''Charon'' to work alongside ''Centaur''.<ref name="Smith15">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 15</ref>

A highlight of ''Centaur'''s pre-war career was the rescue of the 385&nbsp;ton [[Japan]]ese [[Whaler|whale-chaser]] ''Kyo Maru II'' in November 1938.<ref name="Mill13">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 13</ref> ''Kyo Maru II'' had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] Archipelago, where she was in danger of being wrecked by the reefs in the area.<ref name="Smith13"/> ''Centaur'' responded to the distress signal and was easily able to tow ''Kyo Maru II'' to [[Geraldton, Western Australia]].<ref name="Smith13"/>

===1939 to 1942===
[[Image:Kormoran survivors (AWM 305987).jpg|thumb|left|Survivors from [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|HSK ''Kormoran'']] under tow in ''Centaur's'' lifeboats]]
As a vessel of the [[British Merchant Navy]], ''Centaur'' was affected by the British Parliament's 1939 outline of how the Merchant Navy would respond to the declaration of war, primarily submission to the [[Admiralty]] in all matters excluding the crewing and management of vessels.<ref name="Smith15"/> Following the outbreak of [[World War II]] on [[3 September]], [[1939]], ''Centaur'' was equipped with a stern mounted 4&nbsp;inch Mark IX naval gun and two .303 [[Vickers machine gun]]s located on the [[bridge wing]]s for protection against Axis warships and aircraft. She was also fitted with port and starboard [[Paravane (weapon)|paravanes]] and [[Degaussing#Degaussing ships|degaussing]] equipment for protection against [[naval mine]]s.<ref name="Smith18">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 18</ref> The weapons were removed during the hospital ship refit although the anti-mine countermeasures remained.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 21, 53</ref> ''Centaur'' initially remained in service on her original trade route.<ref name="Smith15"/>

On [[26 November]], [[1941]], a damaged lifeboat carrying 62 [[Kriegsmarine]] sailors and officers was spotted by a search aircraft looking for [[HMAS Sydney (1934)|HMAS ''Sydney'']]; the aircraft directed ''Centaur'' to the lifeboat.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 18</ref> Upon encountering the lifeboat, food was lowered to its 62 occupants while one person was allowed onboard to explain the situation.<ref name="Mill19">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 19</ref> Initially posing as a Norwegian merchant navy officer, the man quickly revealed that he was the first officer of the [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|German auxiliary cruiser ''Kormoran'']], and that the lifeboat contained crew, officers, and Captain [[Theodor Detmers]], who had survived ''Kormoran''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> sinking after [[Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran|her battle with HMAS ''Sydney'']] seven days earlier.<ref name="Mill19"/>

Unwilling to leave the shipwrecked men at sea, but afraid of having his ship captured by the Germans, ''Centaur'''s [[Master Mariner|Master]] decided to take the lifeboat in tow, after taking on nine wounded men.<ref name="Smith16">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 16</ref> During the tow towards [[Carnarvon, Western Australia]], the lifeboat was swamped and partially sunk by rough seas.<ref name="Smith16"/> Two lifeboats were lowered from ''Centaur'', which the ''Kormoran'' crew transferred into, before the journey resumed.<ref name="Smith16"/> On arrival in Carnarvon, the Germans were detained in the number one cargo hold.<ref name="Smith16"/> An additional 100 ''Kormoran'' survivors had been collected by other ships, there were loaded aboard ''Centaur'' in the company of 40 Army guards.<ref name="Mill19">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 19</ref> They were transferred to Fremantle and placed in a [[prisoner of war]] camp, where they spent the rest of the war.<ref name="Mill19"/>

Following the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the beginning of the [[Battle of Malaya|Malayan Campaign]] on [[7 December]], [[1941]], ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> run was curtailed to [[Broome, Western Australia]].<ref name="Mill25"/> On [[6 October]], [[1942]], ''Centaur'' was ordered to sail to Queensland, where she began runs between the east coast of Australia and New Guinea, carrying war materiel.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 26</ref>

===1943===
Following Japan's entry into [[World War II]], it became clear that the three hospital ships currently serving Australia, [[AHS Manunda|AHS ''Manunda'']], [[AHS Wanganella|AHS ''Wanganella'']], and Dutch vessel ''[[MS Oranje|Oranje]]'' were inappropriate for operating in the shallow confines of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and primarily from small, temporary ports.<ref name="Smith19">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 19</ref> Of the [[Australian Merchant Navy]] vessels able to operate in this region, none were suitable for conversion to a hospital ship.<ref name="Smith19"/> A request was sent to the [[Department for Transport|British Ministry of Shipping]], who responded on [[4 January]], [[1943]] by placing ''Centaur'' at the disposal of the [[Australian Department of Defence]].<ref name="Smith19"/> The [[#Hospital ship refit|conversion work]] began on [[9 January]], and ''Centaur'' was commissioned as an Australian Hospital Ship on [[1 March]].<ref name="Gill258"/> Data on the ship's identifying markings and the layout of features such as funnel and masts was provided to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] during the first week of February 1943, who in turn provided the information to the Japanese on [[5 February]].<ref name="Gill258"/> This information was also circulated and promoted by the press and media.<ref>Goodman, Rupert (1988). ''Our War Nurses'', p 194</ref>

During her conversion, ''Centaur'' was painted with the markings of a hospital ship as detailed in Article 5 of the 10th section of the [[Hague Convention of 1907]]; white hull with a green band interspersed by three red crosses on each flank of the hull, white superstructure, multiple large red crosses positioned so that the ship's identity would be visible from both sea and air, and the identification number 47 on the bows.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', pp 43–44</ref> At night, the markings were illuminated by a combination of internal and external lights.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 44</ref>

''Centaur'' entered operation as a hospital ship on [[12 March]], [[1943]].<ref name="Smith23">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 23</ref> The early stages of ''Centaur's'' first voyage as a hospital ship were test and transport runs; the initial run from [[Melbourne]] to [[Sydney]] had caused the Master, Chief Engineer, and Chief Medical Officer to compose a long list of defects requiring attention.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 52</ref> Following repairs she conducted a test run to transport wounded servicemen from [[Townsville, Australia|Townsville]] to [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]], to ensure that she was capable of fulfilling the role of a medical vessel.<ref name="Smith23"/> Once this had been ascertained, ''Centaur'' was tasked with the delivery of medical personnel to [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea, returning to Brisbane with Australian and American wounded along with a small number of wounded Japanese prisoners of war.<ref name="Smith24">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 24</ref>

Arriving in Sydney on [[8 May]], [[1943]], ''Centaur'' was re-provisioned at [[Darling Harbour]], before departing for Cairns, Queensland on [[12 May]], [[1943]].<ref name="Smith25">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 25</ref> From there, her destination was again New Guinea.<ref name="Smith25"/> On board at the time were 74 crew, 8 army officers, 12 female army nurses, 45 other army personnel, 192 soldiers from the [[2/12th Field Ambulance (Australia)|2/12th Field Ambulance]], and 1 [[Torres Strait]] [[harbour pilot|ship pilot]].<ref name="Jenkins278">Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', p 278</ref><ref name="Smith27">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 27</ref> Most of the female nurses had transferred from [[MS Oranje|hospital ship ''Oranje'']]<ref>Adam-Smith, Patsy (1984), ''Australian Women at War'' p 176</ref> and all of the male Army personnel aboard were medical staff.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 198</ref> During the loading process there was an incident when the ambulance drivers attached to the 2/12th attempted to bring their rifles and personal supplies of ammunition aboard.<ref name="Good195"/> Meeting with disapproval from ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Master and Chief Medical Officer, and raising concerns amongst the crew and wharf labourers that Centaur would be transporting military supplies or commandos to New Guinea, the rifles were not allowed onboard until ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Master received official reassurance that the ambulance drivers were allowed to carry weapons under the [[Hague Convention of 1907]] (specifically Article 8), as they were used "for the maintenance of order and the defence of the wounded."<ref name="Smith25"/><ref name="Mill76-7">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', pp 76–77</ref> The remaining cargo was searched by the crew and labourers for additional weapons and munitions.<ref name="Mill76-7"/>

==Sinking==
===Events===
At approximately 4:10 a.m. on [[14 May]], [[1943]], while on her second run from [[Sydney]] to [[Port Moresby]], ''Centaur'' was torpedoed by an unknown and unsighted submarine.<ref name="Smith 28">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 28</ref> The torpedo struck the portside oil fuel tank approximately two metres below the waterline, creating a hole eight to ten metres across, igniting the fuel, and setting the ship on fire from the bridge aft.<ref name="Jenkins278"/><ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 104</ref> Many of those onboard were immediately killed by concussion or burned to death.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 105</ref> ''Centaur'' quickly took on water through the impact site, rolled to port, then began to sink bow-first in several hundred metres of water,{{ref|depth|[II]}} submerging completely in less than three minutes.<ref name="Jenkins278"/> The rapid sinking prevented the deployment of lifeboats, although two broke off from ''Centaur'' as she sank, along with several damaged liferafts.<ref name="Gill259"/><ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 128</ref>

''Centaur'' is recorded to have sunk at a point {{convert|24|nmi|km|0}} east-northeast of [[Point Lookout, Queensland|Point Lookout]], [[North Stradbroke Island]], [[Queensland]].<ref name="Stevens358">Stevens, David (2005). ''A Critical Vulnerability'', p 358</ref> The estimated position was extrapolated from the [[dead reckoning]] position calculated at 4:00 a.m. by Second Officer Richard G. Rippon at the end of his [[Watchstanding|watch]], and taking into consideration ''Centaur'''s course and estimated speed at the time of the attack.<ref>Smith, Alan (1992).

''Battle Surface'', p 279</ref> Others, unable to find support, drowned.<ref name="Mill122"/>

The survivors spent 36 hours in the water, using barrels, wreckage, and the two damaged lifeboats for support.<ref name="Gill259"/> During this time, they drifted approximately {{convert|19.6|nmi|km|1}} north east of ''Centaur's'' calculated point of sinking and spread out over an area of two nautical miles.<ref name="Gill258">Gill, George Hermon (1968).

===Rescue===
[[Image:Ellen Savage (AWM 061952).jpg|thumb|Sister Ellen Savage was the sole survivor of the 12 female nurses on board ''Centaur'' at the time of the ship's sinking]] 
On the morning of [[15 May]], [[1943]], American destroyer [[USS Mugford (DD-389)|USS ''Mugford'']] departed [[Brisbane]] to escort the 11,063&nbsp;ton New Zealand freighter ''Sussex'' on the first stage of the latter's trans-[[Tasman Sea|Tasman]] voyage.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993).

===Attacker===
At the time of the attack, none of ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> crew witnessed who or what had attacked the ship. However, due to the position of ''Centaur'' at the time of the attack; the distance off the coast and the depth of water, it was undeniable that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast at the time.<ref name="Gill259">Gill, George Hermon (1968). ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', p 259</ref> Several survivors claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift.<ref name="Smith29">Smith, Alan (1992). ''Three Minutes of Time'', p 29</ref> The submarine was visually sighted by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main groups.<ref name="Smith29"/> Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matching the profile of a [[Kaidai class submarine#KD7|KD7 type]] [[Kaidai class submarine|''Kaidai'' class submarine]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].<ref name="Smith29"/> At the time of the attack, three KD7 ''Kaidais'' were [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|operating off Australia's east coast]]; ''[[Japanese submarine I-177|I-177]]'', ''[[Japanese submarine I-178|I-178]]'', and ''[[Japanese submarine I-180|I-180]]''.<ref name="Gill259"/> None of these submarines survived the war; ''I-177'' was sunk by [[USS Samuel S. Miles|USS ''Samuel S. Miles'']] on [[3 October]], [[1944]],<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 247</ref> ''I-178'' by [[USS Patterson (DD-392)|USS ''Patterson'']] on [[25 August]], [[1943]],<ref name="Gill260">Gill, George Hermon (1968).

In December 1943, the Japanese Government issued a statement formally denying responsibility for the sinking of ''Centaur''.<ref name="Frame188">Frame, Tom (1994). ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p 188</ref> Records provided by the Japanese following the war also did not acknowledge responsibility.<ref name="Gill260"/> Historians concluded that ''I-178'' or ''I-180'' was responsible; the former was considered to be more likely as she had served in Australian waters the longest of any Japanese submarine at the time, but had claimed no kills in the three month period surrounding ''Centaur's'' sinking.<ref name="Gill260"/> Identification of the attacking submarine was not made possible until 1979, when Volume 83 of the official Japanese ''War History Series'' stated that ''I-177'', under Lieutenant Commander Hajime Nakagawa, was the responsible vessel.<ref name="Frame188"/> Nakagawa survived the war, having been transferred from ''I-177'' to ''I-37'' in September 1943.<ref name="Jenkins284">Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', p 284</ref>

Although ''Centaur'''s sinking was a [[war crime]], Nakagawa was not tried for sinking a hospital ship as, despite a series of investigations between 1944 and 1948, the Allies were unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt which submarine had been responsible for the attack.<ref name="Mill196-214">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', pp 196–214</ref> Several of the Japanese officers who had commanded submarines in Australian waters were interrogated.<ref name="Mill196-214"/> Nakagawa was interrogated on three separate occasions.<ref name="Mill196-214"/> The ''Centaur'' case file was closed on [[14 December]], [[1948]], with no direct proof as to the identity of the responsible submarine.<ref name="Mill214">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 214</ref> It was not opened again by any of the Allied Governments.<ref name="Mill214"/> Nakagawa was found guilty as a Class B war criminal for ordering the machinegunning of survivors from three British merchant vessels torpedoed by ''I-37'' in 1944; ''British Chivalry'' on [[22 February]], ''Sutlej'' on [[24 February]], and ''Ascott'' on [[29 February]].<ref name="Jenkins284"/> His defence, that he was acting under orders from Vice Admiral [[Shiro Takasu]], failed and he was sentenced to four years imprisonment at [[Sugamo Prison]].<ref name="Jenkins284"/> Nakagawa refused to speak on the subject of the attack on ''Centaur'', even after Japan's ''War History Series'' implicated him in her sinking.<ref>Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', pp 284–285</ref> Nakagawa died in 1991.<ref name="Smith29"/>

==Reaction==
[[Image:Centaur_(ARTV09088).jpg|thumb|left|A propaganda poster calling for Australians to avenge the sinking of ''Centaur'']]
===Public reaction===
The media were notified of ''Centaur'''s sinking on [[17 May]], [[1943]], but were ordered not to release the news until it had been announced in Parliament by Prime Minister [[John Curtin]].<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 169</ref> This announcement was made on the afternoon of [[17 May]].<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 171</ref> News of the attack made front pages throughout the world, including ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]''.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 175</ref> In some newspapers, the news took precedence over the [[Operation Chastise|'dambuster' raids]] performed in Europe by [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]].<ref name="Wil23">Wilson, Neil (2003). ''Sunken Hearts'', p 23</ref>

The initial public reaction to the attack on ''Centaur'' was one of outrage, significantly different to that displayed when [[Royal Australian Naval]] vessels had been lost, or even when merchant ships had been sunk in Australian waters.<ref name="Frame186-7">Frame, Tom (1994). ''No Pleasure Cruise'', pp 186–187</ref> As a hospital ship, the attack was a breach of the tenth section of the [[Hague Convention of 1907]], and as such was a [[war crime]].<ref name="Frame187">Frame, Tom (1994). ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p 187</ref> The sinking of ''Centaur'' drew strong reactions from General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]]. General MacArthur reflected the common Australian view when he stated that the sinking was an example of Japanese "limitless savagery".<ref>McKernan, Michael (1983), '' All In! Australia During the Second World War'', pp 134–135</ref> Curtin stated that the sinking was "an entirely inexcusable act, undertaken in violation of the convention to which Japan is a party and of all the principles of common humanity".<ref>Adam-Smith, Patsy (1984), ''Australian Women at War'' p 174</ref> Politicians urged the public to use their rage to fuel the war effort.<ref name="Mill179">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 179</ref> ''Centaur'' became a symbol of Australia's determination to defeat what appeared to be a brutal and uncompromising enemy.<ref name="DVA">Department of Veteran's Affairs (2003). ''Sinking of the Centaur - Commemmoration''</ref> The Australian Government produced posters depicting the sinking, which called for Australians to "Avenge the Nurses" by working to produce materiel, purchasing [[war bond]]s, or enlisting in the armed forces.<ref name="DVA"/>

People also expressed their sympathy towards the crew, with several efforts to fund a new hospital ship established.<ref name="Mill179"/> The councillors of [[Caulfield, Victoria]] organised a fund to replace the lost medical equipment, opening with a donation of [[Australian pound|A£]]2,000.<ref name="Mill179"/> Those who worked on ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> conversion contributed money towards a replacement, and employees of [[Ansett Australia]] pledged to donate an hour's pay towards the fitting out of such a replacement.<ref name="Mill179"/>

With some people unable to believe that the Japanese would be so ruthless, rumours began to spread almost immediately after news of the attack was made public.<ref name="Frame177"/> The most common rumour was that ''Centaur'' had been carrying munitions or [[commando]]s at the time of her sinking, with the Japanese made aware of this prior to her departure.<ref name="Frame177">Frame, Tom (1994). ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p 177</ref> This stemmed from the incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.<ref name="Good195"/>

===Military reaction===
[[Image:Centaur poster Lae (AWM 017536).jpg|thumb|A war loan poster captioned 'Save for the brave. Let us avenge the Nurses' displayed at an Australian Army workshop in Lae, New Guinea in September 1944.]]
The attack was universally condemned by Australian servicemen.<ref name="Jenkins282">Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', p 282</ref> It was commonly believed that the attack on ''Centaur'' had been carried out deliberately and in full knowledge of her status.<ref name="Jenkins282"/>

Six days after the attack on ''Centaur'', a request was made by the Australian Department of Defence that the identification markings and lights be removed from [[AHS Manunda|Australian hospital ship ''Manunda'']], weapons be installed, and that she begin to sail blacked out and under escort.<ref name="Mill189-92">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', pp 189–192</ref> The conversion was performed, although efforts by the Department of the Navy, the Admiralty, and authorities in [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States of America]] caused the completed conversion to be undone.<ref name="Mill189-92"/> The cost of the roundabout work came to £12,500, and left ''Manunda'' out of service for three months.<ref name="Mill192">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 192</ref> On [[9 June]], [[1943]], communications between the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] on the subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to this incident, with the conclusion that the attack on ''Centaur'' was the work of an irresponsible commander, and that it would be better to wait until further Japanese attacks had been made before considering the removal of hospital ship markings.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 191</ref>

When the consideration was made that the ambulance drivers' weapons incident just prior to Centaur's voyage may have been partially responsible for the attack, it led to the tightening of rules regarding who was allowed to travel on a hospital ship.<ref name="Good195"/> Some quasi-medical staff, including [[repatriation]] teams, were no longer permitted aboard hospital ships.<ref name="Good195"/> Ambulance drivers who were part of the regular Army instead of the [[Australian Army Medical Corps]] had to be transferred before they would be allowed aboard, although they were still permitted to carry their unloaded weapons and ammunition.<ref>Goodman, Rupert (1988). ''Our War Nurses'', p 197</ref>

===Official protests===
After consultation with the Australian armed forces, General [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]], the [[Admiralty]] and the Australian Government, an official protest was sent to the Japanese, which passed its way through diplomatic channels and was received by the Japanese Government on [[29 May]], [[1943]].<ref name="Mill187">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 187</ref> At around the same time, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] sent a protest on behalf of the main [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Red Cross organisations to the Japanese Red Cross.<ref name="Mill187"/>

On [[26 December]], [[1943]], a response to the Australian protest arrived.<ref name="Mill192"/> It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took no responsibility for what happened.<ref name="Mill192"/> The reply then counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia.<ref name="Good195"/><ref name="Mill192"/> Although several later exchanges were made, without any progress, the British informed the Australian Prime Minister on [[14 November]] that no further communications would be made on the loss of ''Centaur''.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 194</ref>

==Reasons for attack==
The attack on ''Centaur'' was not an isolated incident. Between June 1942 and December 1944, a total of 27 Japanese submarines [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|operated in Australian waters]].<ref name="Jenkins286">Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', p 286</ref> These submarines attacked almost 50 merchant vessels, with 20 sinkings confirmed to be the result of a Japanese attack, and an additional 9 unconfirmed.<ref name="Jenkins286"/> This formed part of a concentrated Japanese effort to destroy supply convoys travelling between Australia and New Guinea.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 68</ref>

Several actions on ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> part may have contributed to her demise.
''Centaur'' was under orders to sail well out to sea until reaching the [[Great Barrier Reef]], with positions between 50 and {{convert|150|nmi|km|-1}} from the coast given.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 87</ref> Upon consideration, and with the belief that they had been given a route intended for a merchant vessel, ''Centaur'''s Master ordered the course be changed to one much closer to land, staying on the seaward side of 2,000 metres in depth.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 88</ref> Also, ''Centaur'' was sailing completely illuminated, with the exception of the two bow floodlights.<ref name="Jenkins278"/> They had been switched off as they interfered with visibility from the bridge.<ref name="Jenkins278"/>

There are three main theories as to why ''Centaur'' was attacked:

===''Centaur'' in breach===
This theory stems from the various rumours spreading after ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> sinking. If ''Centaur'' had been in breach of the [[Hague Convention of 1907]], and someone had informed the Japanese of this, ''I-177'' may have been under orders to attack.<ref name="Mill232">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 232</ref> When ''Centaur'' left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could conclude that the outbound hospital ship was carrying soldiers.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 75, 85</ref> Another consideration was that observers of the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard and come to a similar conclusion.<ref name="Mill76-7"/> If a spy or informant had transmitted that information to the Japanese, ''I-177'' could have been lying in wait.<ref name="Mill232"/> The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that ''Centaur'' was taking an alternate route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.<ref name="Mill233">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 233</ref>

Similar but later rumours included that during her first voyage, ''Centaur'' had transported soldiers to New Guinea, or Japanese [[prisoners of war]] back to Australia for interrogation, and as such was marked as a legitimate target by the Japanese.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 227</ref> ''Centaur'' had carried 10 prisoners of war on her return voyage from New Guinea, but they were wounded.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 65</ref>

===Nakagawa unaware===
This theory states that Nakagawa was unaware that the vessel he was attacking was a hospital ship, and that the sinking was an 'unfortunate accident'.<ref name="Jenkins280">Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', p 280</ref> This view was supported by several Japanese officers, both before and after the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible.<ref name="Jenkins280"/> Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander Zenji Orita, who took command of ''I-177'' after Nakagawa.<ref name="Jenkins280"/> Orita did not hear anything from the crew about having sunk a hospital ship, not even rumours, and later claimed that if ''I-177'' had knowingly attacked ''Centaur'', he would have heard something.<ref name="Jenkins280"/>

When compared to the other contemporary [[List of Australian Hospital Ships|Australian hospital ships]], ''Centaur'' was by far the smallest, slightly more than a third of the size of [[AHS Manunda|''Manunda'']] or [[AHS Wanganella|''Wanganella'']].<ref name="Smith19"/> ''Centaur'' was also slightly shorter in length than ''I-177''.<ref name="Jenkins282"/> The observation of ''Centaur'' was made through a [[periscope]], and some submarine officers attest that at 1,500 metres, the optimum range of attack for World War II Japanese submarines, some officers would not be able to identify the target ship's class or [[pennant number]].<ref name="Jenkins283">Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', p 283</ref> With ''Centaur'''s bow floodlights out, and with the observation of the target made through the periscope, there is a possibility Nakagawa would not have seen the hospital ship's markings if he had been in 'the right position'.<ref name="Jenkins283"/>

However, apart from the two bow floodlights, ''Centaur'' was lit up brilliantly.<ref name="Mill233"/> To attack, ''I-177'' would have had to approach from [[wiktionary:abeam|abeam]] of ''Centaur'', with the latter illuminated by both its own lights and a full moon.<ref name="Jenkins283"/>

===Nakagawa aware===
This theory states that Nakagawa was fully aware that his target was a hospital ship and, on either his own initiative or his poor interpretation of his orders, decided to sink her regardless.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 235</ref> Why he may have chosen to do so is a question he refused to respond to on multiple occasions, even to defend himself or deny the accusation.<ref>Jenkins, David (1992). ''Battle Surface'', pp 284–285</ref> Researchers speculate that as Nakagawa was approaching the end of his tour in Australian waters, and had only sunk a single enemy vessel, the 8,742&nbsp;ton freighter ''Limerick'', he did not want to return with the disgrace of a single kill.<ref name="Jenkins278"/> His orders to machinegun the survivors of three destroyed British merchant vessels showed that he was willing to ignore the [[laws of war]].<ref name="Jenkins284"/> Nakagawa may have been acting in vengeance for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] atrocities during the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], or may have expected praise for the sinking of an enemy naval vessel.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 236</ref> Nakagawa's refusal to speak on the subject, coupled with his 1991 death, mean this question can never be answered.

==Shipwreck==
Following [[World War II]], several cursory searches of the waters around [[North Stradbroke Island]] and [[Moreton Island]] failed to reveal ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> location. It was believed that she had sunk off the edge of the [[continental shelf]], to a depth the [[Royal Australian Navy]] did not, and still does not, have the capability to search for a vessel of ''Centaur''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> size.<ref name="DOD29-6-03">Department of Defence (2003). ''Navy findings of search for ex Army Hospital Ship (AHS) Centaur''</ref>
In 1995, it was announced that the shipwreck of ''Centaur'' had been located in waters nine nautical miles (17 km) from the lighthouse on [[Moreton Island]], a significant distance from her believed last position.<ref name="60mins18-5-03">''A Grave Mistake'' (2003) [''60 Minutes'' segment]</ref> The finding was reported on ''[[A Current Affair]]'', during which film of the shipwreck 170 metres underwater was shown.<ref name="60mins18-5-03"/> Discoverer Donald Dennis claimed the identity of the shipwreck had been confirmed by the Navy, the [[Queensland Maritime Museum]], and the [[Australian War Memorial]].<ref name="60mins18-5-03"/> A cursory search by the Navy confirmed that there was a ship at the given location, which was [[gazetted]] as a [[war grave]] and added to navigation charts by the [[Australian Hydrographic Office]].<ref name="DOD29-6-03"/><ref name="60mins18-5-03"/>

Over the next eight years, there was growing doubt about the position of Dennis' wreck, due to the distance from Second Officer Rippon's calculation of the point of sinking, and where USS ''Mugford'' picked up the survivors.<ref name="Wil24">Wilson, Neil (2003). ''Sunken Hearts'', p 24</ref> Dennis had been convicted on two counts of deception and one of theft through scams.<ref name="Wil24"/> Two [[wreck diver]]s used the location for an eight hour world record dive, during which examined the wreck and took photographs, claiming it to be too small to be ''Centaur''.<ref name="60mins18-5-03"/><ref name="Wil24"/>

On the 60th anniversary of the sinking, in 2003, the [[newsmagazine]] show ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' ran a story demonstrating that the wreck was not ''Centaur''<ref name="60mins18-5-03"/> It was revealed that nobody at the Queensland Maritime Museum had yet seen the footage, and when it was shown to Museum president Rod McLeod and maritime historian John Foley, they stated that the shipwreck could not be ''Centaur'', as the rudder was incorrectly shaped.<ref name="60mins18-5-03"/> Following this story, and others published around the same time in newspapers, the Navy sent three ships to inspect the site over a two month period; HMA Ships [[HMAS Hawkesbury (M 83)|''Hawkesbury'']], [[HMAS Melville (A 246)|''Melville'']], and [[HMAS Yarra (M 87)|''Yarra'']], before concluding that the shipwreck was incorrectly identified as ''Centaur''.<ref name="DOD29-6-03"/> An amendment was made to the gazettal, and the Hydrographic Office began to remove the mark from charts.<ref name="DOD29-6-03"/>

It was speculated by ''60 Minutes'' that the wreck was the 55 metre long ''Kyogle'', a [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] freighter purchased by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1951 and used for bombing practice on [[12 May]], [[1951]].<ref name="60mins18-5-03"/>

==Memorials==
[[Image:AU AHS Centaur mem.jpg|thumb|right|''Centaur'' memorial, Point Danger, [[Coolangatta, Queensland]]]]
A memorial to ''Centaur'' was unveiled on the 50th anniversary of the sinking, [[14 May]] [[1993]], at Point Danger, [[Coolangatta, Queensland]].<ref name="Larsen art">Larsen, C. (1994), ''Centaur memorial unveiled'', p 2</ref> It consists of a monumental stone topped with a cairn, surrounded by a tiled moat with memorial plaques explaining the commemoration. The memorial is surrounded by a park with a boardwalk, overlooking the sea, with plaques for other Merchant Navy and [[Royal Australian Navy]] vessels lost during World War II. The unveiling of the memorial was performed by Minister for Veteran's Affairs, [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[John Faulkner]].<ref name="Larsen art"/> In addition to Australian survivors and local dignitaries, a contingent from USS ''Mugford'' travelled from the [[United States]] for the event.

Although the memorial at Point Danger is considered to be the primary commemoration of the incident, numerous other tributes were made prior to 1993, many of which still exist. 

In 1948, Queensland nurses established the "Centaur Memorial Fund for Nurses" which used the money raised to purchase an establishment and name it "Centaur House"; a facility supporting nurses by holding convivial meetings and providing inexpensive accommodation for out-of-town nurses.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 251</ref> The original Centaur House was sold in 1971, with a new building purchased and renamed.<ref name="Mill252">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 252</ref> The second Centaur House was sold in 1979 and although the fund still exists, it no longer owns a physical facility.<ref name="Mill252"/> On [[15 September]], [[1968]], a [[cairn]] was unveiled at [[Caloundra, Queensland]], erected by the local [[Rotary International|Rotary International Club]].<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', pp 256–257</ref> In 1990, a [[stained glass]] memorial window depicting ''Centaur'', along with a plaque listing the names of those lost in the attack was installed at [[Concord Repatriation General Hospital]], at a cost of $16,000.<ref>Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 257</ref> A display about ''Centaur'' was placed at the [[Australian War Memorial]].<ref name="Mil255"/> The centrepiece of the display was a scale model of ''Centaur'' presented by [[Blue Funnel Line]], and the display included items that were donated by the survivors, such as a lifejacket, a signal flare, and a medical kit.<ref name="Mil255">Milligan, Christopher & Foley, John (1993). ''Australian Hospital Ship Centaur - the myth of immunity'', p 255</ref> It was removed in 1992 to make way for a display related to the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="Mil255"/>
