'''Pamela Susan Courson''' ([[December 22]], [[1946]]-[[April 25]], [[1974]]) was best known as the long-term companion of late [[The Doors|Doors]]' vocalist [[Jim Morrison]].  After the deaths of Morrison and Courson, her parents petitioned an out-of-state court to declare that the couple had a [[Common-law marriage|common law marriage]], despite the fact that theirs was an open relationship, and that Morrison's will described him as "an unmarried person."

==Biography==

===Early life and involvement with Morrison===
Courson was born in Weed, California. Though it is not clear when she first met Morrison, one biography states that they met at Gazzari's nightclub on the [[Sunset Strip]] in 1965, while Courson was an art student at [[Los Angeles City College]]. [http://www.swinginchicks.com/pamela_morrison.htm]  In his 1998 [[memoir]] ''Light My Fire: My Life with the Doors'', former keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] stated that Courson and a friend saw the band during their stint at the London Fog, a lesser-known nightclub, and that she was initially courted by drummer [[John Densmore]].

In any event, Morrison called Courson his "cosmic mate" and dedicated his self-published books of poetry to her, as well as songs such as "Love Street".[http://www.swinginchicks.com/pamela_morrison.htm] Their relationship was tumultuous, with repeated infidelity by both partners.  Morrison even married another girlfriend, [[Patricia Kennealy]], at an unofficial Wiccan wedding in 1970. In an interview for the book ''Rock Wives'', Kennealy said of Courson: "I really did like her. She was nice. She wasn't an incredibly towering intellect, but she seemed very sweet and very pretty, very California." [http://www.swinginchicks.com/pamela_morrison.htm]

Courson had no job or career of her own while she was with Morrison, other than a brief attempt at running Themis, a fashion boutique that Morrison bought for her.  Her death certificate lists her occupation as “women’s apparel.”

===Deaths of Morrison and Courson===
On [[July 3]], [[1971]] James Douglas Morrison was found dead by Courson, in the bathtub of an apartment they were sharing in Paris. He was twenty-seven years of age. The official coroner's report listed his cause of death as heart failure. However, despite Morrison being young and of apparent good health, and the presence of blood in the water, no autopsy was performed, and questions persist over the actual cause of death. Per the stipulation in his will, which stated that he was "an unmarried person", Courson inherited his entire fortune, yet lawsuits against the estate would tie up her quest for inheritance for the next two years. After Pamela received her share of Morrison's royalties, she never renewed contact with the remaining Doors members. She did not have long to enjoy the inheritance.

After Morrison's death, Courson became a recluse, using heroin and showing signs of mental instability.  She told friends that she had killed Morrison, or, alternatively, that Morrison was still alive.[http://www.swinginchicks.com/pamela_morrison.htm]

On [[April 25]], [[1974]], Courson died of a [[heroin]] [[overdose]] at the Los Angeles apartment she shared with two male friends. She was twenty-seven, the same age at which Jim Morrison died. Her parents intended that she be buried next to Morrison at Pere-Lachaise cemetery in Paris, and listed this location as the place of burial on her death certificate, but due to legal complications with transporting the body to France, her parents had her [[cremains]] buried at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, California, under the name "Pamela Susan Morrison". After her death, her parents Columbus and Penny inherited Morrison's entire fortune, but their executorship of the estate was later contested by Morrison's parents, George and Clara Morrison.

Courson was portrayed by [[Meg Ryan]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film, ''The Doors''.
