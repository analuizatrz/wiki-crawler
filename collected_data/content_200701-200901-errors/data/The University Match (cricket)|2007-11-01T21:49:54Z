'''The University Match''' in a [[cricket|cricketing]] context is generally understood to refer to the annual fixture between [[Oxford University Cricket Club]] and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club]]. Since 2001, in most of their fixtures Oxford have appeared as the Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Oxford UCCE, incorporating [[Oxford Brookes University]]), and Cambridge have appeared as the Cambridge University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Cambridge UCCE, incorporating [[Anglia Ruskin University]]), but this does not apply to the University Match.

==History==

The match was traditionally an annual three day [[first-class cricket|first-class]] fixture, normally held at [[Lord's]]. (Until 1854, with the exceptions of 1841 and 1850, it was played over two days instead of three.) However from 2001 the match has been replaced by two fixtures each year: a one-day match played at Lord's and a four day first-class fixture played in alternate years at [[Fenner's]] in Cambridge and [[The Parks]] in Oxford. [[University Sporting Blue|Blues]] are awarded to those appearing in either match. Unless otherwise stated, statistics quoted in this article are for the first-class fixtures only.

In terms of the ''clubs'' concerned, the University Match dating from [[1827 English cricket season|1827]] is the oldest first-class fixture still being played.  However, it should be noted that fixtures involving certain county teams prior to formation of the current county clubs do have a much longer history. The oldest known county fixture is [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] v [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]], which dates back to 1709 at least.  The oldest county club is [[Sussex CCC]], founded in 1839.

The next two University matches were in 1829 and 1836. From 1838 it has been played annually, except for the war years of 1915-1918 and 1940-45. It was still a major social, as well as sporting, event as recently as just after World War Two. The first match was played at Lord's, but it was only in 1851 that Lord's became the permanent venue, five of the early matches having been played in the vicinity of Oxford.

Two of the most famous matches occurred in consecutive years in the 1870s. The first was 'Cobden's Match' in 1870. [[F.C. Cobden]] took the last three Oxford wickets in consecutive balls to give Cambridge victory by 2 runs. The following year [[S.E. Butler]] took 10-38 in the Cambridge first innings (the only instance of a bowler taking all ten), followed by 5 more wickets in the second innings. Another notable match was in 1923, which became known as the "Thunderstorm match". Oxford had run up a good score, and a torrential storm for much of the night rendered the pitch almost unplayable, so that Cambridge were quickly dismissed in two innings.

[[William Yardley (cricketer)|William Yardley]] of Cambridge has the distinction of scoring the first two hundreds made in the series: 100 in 1870 in Cobden's Match and 130 in 1872.

[[Robin Marlar]]'s bowling figures for Cambridge are worth noting:
* 1951: 5-41 and 1-64
* 1952: 7-104 and 2-25
* 1953: 5-94 and 7-49

Players who became (or in a few instances were already) famous to have appeared in the match include: [[Stanley Jackson]] (1890-3), [[CB Fry]] (1892-5), [[K S Ranjitsinhji]] (1893), [[Gilbert Jessop]] (1896-9), [[Tip Foster|RE Foster]] (1897-1900), [[Douglas Jardine]] (1920-1, 1923), [[KS Duleepsinhji]] (1925-8), [[Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi snr]] (1929-31), [[Martin Donnelly]] (1946-7), [[Peter May]] (1950-2), [[Colin Cowdrey]] (1952-4), [[M. J. K. Smith]] (1954-6), [[Ted Dexter]] (1956-8), [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi jnr]] (1960-1, 1963), [[Mike Brearley]] (1961-4), [[Imran Khan]] (1973-5) and [[Mike Atherton]] (1987, 1989). It can be seen that the majority were batsmen rather than bowlers and that the 1890s and 1950s to early 1960s were particularly fertile periods.
