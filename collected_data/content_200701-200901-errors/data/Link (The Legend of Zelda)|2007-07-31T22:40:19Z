{{nihongo|'''Link'''|リンク|Rinku}} is the fictional [[protagonist]] of [[Nintendo]]'s [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''The Legend of Zelda'' video game series]] created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. ''The Legend of Zelda'' is one of [[Nintendo]]'s flagship game franchises, which sold over 47 million copies worldwide as of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|author=David|publisher=Australia's PAL Gaming Network|year=2005|url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=3605&sid=4cea9e5e814470cb7ea6fd462d04a13e|title=Nintendo reveal sales figures|accessdate=February 12|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Their enduring popularity has led to many incarnations of the ''Legend of Zelda'' story and of its Link character. The character's first appearance took place in the 1986 video game ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', where he was portrayed by a [[Sprite (computer graphics)|two-dimensional sprite]]; in later releases Link's appearance has been conveyed by a [[3D computer graphics|computer-generated image]]. The character Link has been featured in other video games from Nintendo,  on Nintendo's merchandising, on comic books, and even on a [[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|television show]] about ''The Legend of Zelda'' series. Link was also honored with a star on the [[Walk of Game]] in [[2005]] alongside [[Mario]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]].

Link is described as a young [[Races of The Legend of Zelda series#Hylians|Hylian]] boy from the fictional land of [[Hyrule]]. His age varies depending on the game, incarnations usually vary from preteen to the late teens. He is also one of the few [[left-handed]] protagonists in video games, although in the [[Wii]] version of [[Twilight Princess]], Link is right-handed.<ref name="Nintonline">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/08982.shtml | title=Miyamoto Interview| date=[[1998-08-01]] | publisher=Nintendo Online Magazine | author=Kushida| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> Link often journeys through the realm of [[Hyrule]], defeating evil forces and Hyrule's nemesis [[Ganon]], also known as Ganondorf. To defeat Ganon, Link usually needs the mystical [[Master Sword]] (the only exception is that in the original ''Legend of Zelda'', the sword of evil's bane was called the Magic Sword), which is often obtained after many trials and battles using other swords and shields, as well as auxiliary weaponry such as boomerangs, bombs, and a bow and arrows. Although young, Link is portrayed as a great courageous warrior who has (or develops, depending on the game) a close relationship with [[Princess Zelda]], whom he has repeatedly rescued. In several games in the series, Link must learn how to play a musical instrument that usually features in the game's plot and can magically unlock several spells.

==Conception and creation==
The character has been portrayed with almost no spoken dialogue in the game series. Facial expressions have only been used since the series went to the [[Nintendo 64]]. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] has said in interviews that his conceptualization of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' series and of Link was based on his childhood memories of books, movies and stories. In one of the interviews, he tells us he tried to make people identify with Link and have the opportunity to be heroes like the character. The games conform to his view, and although at the end of some games Link becomes vastly talented in physical and magical arts, he always starts as a regular boy when the game begins. An example of this is shown in ''Ocarina of Time'' where he starts as an orphaned Hylian boy and ends as the legendary Hero of Time.<ref name="origin">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/230403.shtml | title=Shigeru Miyamoto Interview| date=[[2003-04-23]] | publisher=Superplay Magazine | author=Superplay Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref>  The idea of Link always starting out as "ordinary" may be attributed to the fact that, in almost every game in the [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|Zelda]] series, Link and [[Princess Zelda|Zelda]] are reincarnations or descendants of the same two people. [[Ganondorf]], however, is always the same person.

===Character creation===



There have been several different "Links" in the history of Hyrule, the land where the Zelda series takes place. The existence of multiple Links is made obvious on many occasions in the games; for example, the introduction sequences of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap|The Minish Cap]]'' refer to an ancient, legendary champion who is identical in appearance to Link, and ''The Wind Waker'' directly mentions the "Hero of Time" (a title given to Link in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'') as a historical entity. Shigeru Miyamoto has stated, "For every Zelda game we tell a new story, but we actually have an enormous document that explains how the game relates to the others, and bind them together. But to be honest, they are not that important to us. We care more about developing the game system... give the player new challenges for every chapter that is born."<ref name="origin">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/230403.shtml | title=Shigeru Miyamoto Interview| date=[[2003-04-23]] | publisher=Superplay Magazine | author=Superplay Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.digitaltrends.com/featured_article58.html | title=Gaming Legend Shigeru Miyamoto Speaks| date=[[2006-06-19]] | publisher=Digital Trends | author=Chris Zimmerman| accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>  Miyamoto has also confirmed that there have been multiple Links in different times in Hyrule. However, the exact [[chronology]] of the ''Zelda'' series and the lineage of the various Links, though written down by Miyamoto and his team, has never been released in detail.<ref name="creation">{{cite web|author=Chris Leyton|publisher=Total Video Games.com|year=February 26, 2003|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/news/The_Miyamoto_Interview_3946_0_1.htm|title=The Miyamoto Interview [ News ]|accessdate=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Some major fan sites have attempted to construct a coherent ''Zelda'' timeline based on available information, but with little success.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cory Faller|publisher= N-Sider|date=January 1, 2005|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=248&page=1|title=The Legends of Zelda|accessdate=September 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Miyamoto has stated that ''Ocarina of Time'' is the first story, then the original ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', then ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', and finally ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'', with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]]'' falling sometime after ''Ocarina of Time''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher= Nintendo Power|date=November 19, 1998|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/111998.shtml|title=Miyamoto Interview|accessdate=October 7|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On the design of Link in ''The Wind Waker'', Miyamoto explained, "Link was a young boy and trying to create a very active and very energetic young boy and trying to choose the right style for portraying the young boy in a game like that we tried many different experiments. The ultimate decision we came to was that the cel-shading in ''The Wind Waker'' was the best option for expressing that."<ref name="Eree">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|publisher= IGN|date=May 12 2004|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/514/514589p1.html|title=E3 2004: Miyamoto and Aonuma on Zelda|accessdate=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The Wind Waker takes place with a new Link centuries after the victory of Link in ''Ocarina of Time''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher= Nintendo of Japan|date=May 12 2004|url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/interview-legend_of_zelda_wind_waker_miyamoto.htm|title=windwaker interview|accessdate=September 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

There is speculation that the movie ''[[Ladyhawke]]'' inspired ''[[Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]''.  Miyamoto denied that there was any relation, commenting that "We thought that by adding these animals it would help us create a larger and more realistic world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/617/617000p1.html | title=Gaming Legend Shigeru Miyamoto Speaks| date=[[2005-05-19]] | publisher=IGN.com | author=Matt Casamassina| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> ''Twilight Princess'' also incorporated a switch of focus from young Link growing up to a teenage Link, which lead to various designs and features around this idea.<ref name="Eree">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|publisher= IGN|year=May 12th, 2004|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/514/514589p1.html|title=E3 2004: Miyamoto and Aonuma on Zelda|accessdate=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Actor portrayal===
In the 3D games, beginning with ''Ocarina of Time'', Link has been voiced by four actors; [[Nobuyuki Hiyama]] for adult Link, [[Fujiko Takimoto]] for young Link, [[Sachi Matsumoto]] as Link in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' and [[Akira Sasanuma]] in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]'', but because no ''Zelda'' game to date contains substantial spoken dialogue, the part consists only of short phrases, grunts, battle cries, and other sounds.<ref name="staff">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0898.shtml | title=Miyamoto Interview| date=[[1998-08-01]] | publisher=Nintendo Power | author=Nintendo Power Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> In ''The Wind Waker'', however, Link has been heard saying the phrase, "Come on!" when the player calls upon a special statue native to the Tower of the Gods dungeon or Medli or Makar in their respective dungeons. Voice acting in the series has been limited since the game makers feel that players have their own ideas about how Link is supposed to sound and they wish to avoid a backlash.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0898.shtml | title=Miyamoto and Aonuma Interview| date=[[2002-12-04]] | publisher=IGN | author=IGN Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> A professional samurai sword stunt man performed motion capture for ''Ocarina of Time''.<ref name="staff">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0898.shtml | title=Miyamoto Interview| date=[[1998-08-01]] | publisher=Nintendo Power | author=Nintendo Power Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
According to the official Zelda.com Encyclopedia, Link is "humble", but also possesses legendary bravery, an attribute consistent with his role as the rightful bearer of the Triforce of Courage. The character is known in later Zelda games as '''The Hero of Time''' in his ''Ocarina of Time''/''Majora's Mask'' incarnation and as '''The Hero of Winds''' in ''The Wind Waker''/''Phantom Hourglass'', as his heroism has saved countless lives from evil.<ref name="pedia">{{cite web | url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/l.jsp |author= Nintendo| title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Link | publisher=Zelda Universe |year=January 1, 2006| accessdate=2005-09-20}}</ref> In the video games he is presented as being a stoic and polite young man, and in the television series as a whiny and lovesick teenager. In ''Twilight Princess'', his social status is explored early in the game. Rather than being the most popular kid in his hometown, Link is instead portrayed as a regular kid.

He is the rightful bearer of the [[Master Sword]], a powerful and magical sword he wields to defeat the forces of evil. Link does show rare moments of overzealous boldness, such as when he twice attempts to confront [[Ganon]] in ''The Wind Waker'' ill equipped to defeat him. Also, he inadvertently helped Ganon find the [[Triforce]] in Ocarina of Time, forcing Link to undo the damage he had caused.<ref name="pedia">{{cite web | url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/l.jsp |author= Nintendo| title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Link | publisher=Zelda Universe |year=January 1, 2006| accessdate=2005-09-20}}</ref> Although Zelda games feature more interaction with friendly or neutral non-player characters (NPCs) than some adventure games, such as the [[Metroid series|''Metroid'' series]], these characters rarely take an active part in Link’s quest which he completes alone. Link is shown to have several family members, such as an uncle in ''A Link to the Past'', an unseen mother in ''Ocarina of Time'' who died fleeing the ravages of war, a grandmother in ''The Wind Waker'' who raises him in his parents unexplained absence, a grandfather from ''Minish Cap'', and the most developed of Link's relatives, his sister Aryll who plays a critical role in the plot of ''The Wind Waker''. He also has several friends, such as the pirate captain Tetra from ''The Wind Waker'', Kafei from ''Majora's Mask'', and the fairy [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time#Navi|Navi]] from ''Ocarina of Time''. He also has a [[utilitarian]] relationship with [[Midna]] from ''Twilight Princess'', though the two grow to become friends as time goes on.<ref name="gamein">{{cite web | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200505/N05.0525.1742.45225.htm | last=Berghammer | first=Billy | title=Zelda's Twilight Prince: The Eji Aonuma Interview | publisher=Game Informer | date=[[2005-05-25]] | accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> His mother and father also appear as spirits in the ''Link to the Past'' manga.<ref name="manga">{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda Shrine|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://zs.ffshrine.org/link-to-the-past/manga.php|title=Zelda a Link to the Past - Manga / Comics|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Link appears as a young Hylian boy, the equivalent to human in ''The Legend of Zelda'' mythos. He is renowned for his formidable swordmanship and fighting skill , such as his incredible boomerang accuracy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp |author=Nintendo|year=January 1, 2006| title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Boomerang | publisher=Zelda Universe | accessdate=2005-09-11}}</ref> It is unlikely that his age ever exceeds 19 years at any point in the series, though apparently, in most games he is closer to the age of 7 to 12.<ref name="Nintonline">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/08982.shtml | title=Miyamoto Interview| date=[[1998-08-01]] | publisher=Nintendo Online Magazine | author=Kushida| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> Every Link wears a green tunic, an undershirt (usually white, brown, or green), and a long, floppy green cap, at least for part of each adventure (usually for the vast majority), although the shades of green vary. It is also a common sight to see him wearing light-colored tights (usually white or tan), although he has appeared barelegged in other games. Link’s hair color is usually a dark blond but was originally a brown colour. Link has long pointed ears resembling some conceptions of [[Elf|elves]]. These are apparently a distinctive trait of the Hylian race (and their descendants), which supposedly allows them to hear messages from the gods. Older Links usually wear small blue hoop earrings, as is the Hylian fashion. However, in episode 4 of the Adult Saga in the official ''[[Ocarina of Time]]'' manga series, "Link Vs. Link", Impa is seen giving a Link his earrings, describing it as a "rite of passage for young [[Sheikah]] men".<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=zeldalegacy.net|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://zeldalegacy.net/cpg/thumbnails.php?album=71|title=Chapter 10 - Link vs. Link|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> He  bears a Triforce mark on his left hand, marking him as the one who will find the Triforce of Courage.<ref name="iiinstructions">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Nintendo | title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link instruction manual | pages= | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref> He is  well known for making use of a variety of weapons and items, such as [[bomb]]s, hookshot, [[boomerang]], bow and arrow and Pegasus boots that make him run extremely fast. He is also (in some incarnations) physically powerful, able to overpower Ganondorf in blade to blade combat or blade locks despite Ganondorf's far greater size (in this particular incarnation Link from early in the game appears to be more powerful than other Links). He is extremely nimble, being able to perform quick jumps and flips, and very skilled, knowing how to perform magic and play an [[ocarina]]. When he transforms into an animal in the twilight realm in ''Twilight Princess'', he becomes a wolf, reflecting the mystical aspects of the transformation and his heroism.<ref name="gamein" />

Canonically, Link is [[left-handed]], although this detail has changed over time, with his sword hand being different between games. The ''Adventure of Link'' instruction booklet describes Link setting off “with a magical sword in his left hand and a magical shield in his right”.<ref name="iiinstructions">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Nintendo | title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link instruction manual | pages= | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref> In the Super Nintendo release, he alternates hands, but this is due to sprite mirroring. Starting with ''The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening'', Link holds his sword in his left hand and his shield in his right, no matter what direction he is facing. This occurs in the left and right-looking sprites. In ''The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap'', however, Link returns to alternately holding his weapon in the right or the left hand, depending on his orientation. At the beginning of the ''Four Swords Plus'' (''Four Swords Adventures'') [[manga]], Link is referred to as the “left-handed hero” after defeating pirates that were raiding a Hylian town. In addition, Link's figurine description in ''Wind Waker'' lists his "manual preference" as left. However, in the animated TV series, Link is [[right-handed]]. In the Wii version of ''Twilight Princess'', Link is right-handed, but this was done to better fit the game's control scheme. Because of this, the maps in the Wii version have also been mirrored. However, in the game's official artwork he is shown holding his sword in his left hand. In the [[GameCube]] version Link remains left-handed, since the game keeps a traditional control scheme.<ref name="miyamoto right link">{{cite web | last=Casamassina | first=Matt | authorlink=Matt Casamassina | date=[[2006-09-20]] | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733762p1.html | title=Miyamoto Talks Righty Link | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

[[Image:Link LOZ with items.png|130px|thumb|left|Link, as he first appeared in [[The Legend of Zelda]].]]
Link debuted with the [[February 21]], [[1986]] release of the video game ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' in [[Japan]]. Described as a "young lad" who saved [[Princess Zelda]]’s elderly nursemaid [[Impa]] from [[Ganon]]'s henchmen,<ref>Nintendo (1997). ''The Legend of Zelda'' instruction manual. (in English). http://zeldaclassic.armageddongames.net/walkthroughs/zeldamanual.txt</ref> Link assumes the role of the generic hero attempting to rescue the princess Zelda (and the kingdom of [[Hyrule]]) from the evil wizard Ganon, who has stolen the [[Triforce]] of Power.

In ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', Link approaches his 16th birthday.  Impa takes him to North Castle in [[Hyrule]], alarmed by the sudden appearance of a Triforce crest on the boy’s left hand. She shows him the true heiress of Hyrule, an older incarnation of Princess Zelda, trapped in an [[eternal sleep]], lying on an altar in the castle. The old woman also tells Link the Legend of Zelda, an ancient tale about the division of the Triforce and the curse that was put upon the older princess. Impa then gives Link six crystals, and a [[scroll]] written in an ancient Hylian tongue, which Link understands despite having never learned it. He reads that the mark on his hand is the sign that he was chosen to seek the third Triforce, [[Courage]], in the Great Palace in the Valley of Death. Link then begins a quest to place a crystal in each of six [[palace]]s in Hyrule, so that he can later penetrate unhindered into the magically protected Great Palace, claim the Triforce of Courage, reunite the three pieces of the Triforce, and awaken Zelda.<ref>{{cite book | year=1989 | editor=Nintendo | title=''The Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link'' | pages=3-12 | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref>

''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' tells the story of how, centuries before the events of ''The Legend of Zelda'', Ganon and his army of evil were banished into the Golden Land, the realm of the Triforce, by the Hylians, at the price of countless lives. The [[portal (fiction)|portal]] to this world was magically blocked by seven sages, and the lands behind that seal, which Hylians hoped would never be broken again, became known as the Dark World, as they were corrupted by Ganon’s malice. The struggle to seal Ganon in the Golden Land became known as the Imprisoning War. Many believe that the Imprisoning war refers to the events in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]. One day, when the Imprisoning War had been all but forgotten, the land is plagued by sudden disaster, until the wizard [[Agahnim]] appears at the court of the king of Hyrule and quells the upheaval. Named chief advisor to the throne, he soon seizes power from the king and kidnaps six maidens, descendants of the wise men who had sealed the entrance of the Dark World. The maidens are taken to the castle tower, and never seen again. Agahnim then begins a dark ritual to break the seal on the Dark World and unleash Ganon’s fury upon Hyrule. Princess Zelda herself descends from the seventh sage, and manages to send out a [[telepathy|telepathic]] call for help before being taken away. Link’s uncle heads for the royal castle first, but he is quickly dispatched. He leaves Link his sword and with his last breath imparts the sword-spin technique. The young hero then begins a journey to collect three magical [[Pendant]]s of Virtue, and claim the Master Sword as his before facing Agahnim. 

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening]]'', which takes place after ''A Link to the Past''<ref>{{cite book | year=1993 | editor=Nintendo | title=The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening instruction manual | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref>

He washes up on the shore of a mysterious island called Koholint. Link is taken to the house of a kind man named [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening#Tarin|Tarin]] and his daughter [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening#Marin|Marin]]. A strange talking [[owl]] tells him that the only way he can escape Koholint Island is by awakening the “Wind Fish”, a giant creature slumbering in a colossal [[Egg (biology)|egg]] in the center of the island.<ref>{{cite book | year=1993 | editor=Nintendo | title=The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening instruction manual | pages=41-42 | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref>

====1997–2001==== 
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', a young Link has been raised as one of the [[Kokiri]], the “children of the forest”. Unlike the other Kokiri, Link does not have a [[fairy]] companion, and is thus shunned by their leader, Mido.<ref>'''Mido:''' Hey you! "Mr. No Fairy!" What's your business with the Great Deku Tree?

even a real man! {{cite video game | title =The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time | developer =Nintendo ED | publisher =Nintendo | date=1998-11-23 | platform =Nintendo 64 | language=English }}</ref> Link's life changes one day when the [[Great Deku Tree]], the forest's guardian, sends [[Navi]] the fairy to Link with instructions to bring him immediately. A curse has been cast on the Deku Tree, and he asks Link to break it. While Link is successful in defeating the monsters inside the Tree, the Tree was doomed before Link started. Dying, the Deku Tree tells Link of the [[Triforce]] and directs Link to [[Hyrule Castle]], where he encounters [[Princess Zelda]]. She sends him on a mission to collect three Spiritual Stones and save Hyrule. Once Link obtains the Stones, he travels to the Temple of Time and opens the Door of Time with the Stones and the Ocarina of Time. He then draws the [[Master Sword]] from the Pedestal of Time. This action imprisons Link in the Temple of Light in the Sacred Realm for seven years, while [[Ganondorf]] takes control of Hyrule and seizes the [[Triforce]] of Power. Seven years after drawing the sword from the pedestal, Link is awakened as the Hero of Time by Rauru, Sage of Light. Link finds that much time has passed, and he has grown up. He sets off on a quest to cleanse the land of Ganondorf’s evil by awakening the Sages, who can seal Ganondorf in what used to be the Sacred Realm. Returning to the Kokiri Forest, he finds that none of his friends have grown up, and most now no longer recognize him. After the player completes the first dungeon in this phase of the game, the Deku Tree's successor, the Deku Sprout, reveals the hidden story of Link's past to him. The Kokiri never grow up; the reason Link has grown, while his Kokiri friends have not, is that he is actually a [[Hylian]], orphaned in the wars that raged before Hyrule was united.<ref>'''Deku Tree Sprout:''' Well, as you might have already guessed, you are not a Kokiri!

[[Image:Linkmask3.jpg|right|140px|thumb|Link with the Goron Mask in ''Majora's Mask'']]
''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' occurs after Link defeats [[Ganon]] and is sent back in time to his childhood. Link leaves Hyrule to search for a lost friend (declared by the official [[manga]] to be his old fairy companion, [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time#Navi|Navi]], which is a reasonable assumption in the game as well). While riding deep in the Lost Woods, he is ambushed by a [[Skull Kid]] who is possessed by an evil artifact, Majora’s Mask, and his horse, [[Epona]], is stolen. Chasing the Skull Kid, Link falls into a crevasse and arrives in a country called [[Termina]]. He must save this land from the evil of Majora’s Mask, which has drawn the moon into a decaying orbit, causing it to crash into Termina’s capital city in just three days. Link uses the Ocarina of Time and the Song of Time, which sends him back in time and saves the game when he plays it, to relive these three days again and again in order to prevent the disaster. Along the way Link finds many magical masks of his own, a handful of which allow him to transform. Those masks can turn him into a rock-like [[The Legend of Zelda series races#Gorons|Goron]]; a petite, plant-like [[The Legend of Zelda series races#Deku|Deku Scrub]]; a graceful aquatic [[The Legend of Zelda series races#Zoras|Zora]]; or the Fierce Deity. In this game, Link never grows up in the traditional sense, but the dark power of the Fierce Deity’s Mask allows Link to assume a powerful adult form, “Fierce Deity Link”, also known to some fans by the incorrect name “[[Oni (Japanese folklore)|Oni]]-Link” due to poor translation of the mask's Japanese name. This form is easily his largest, standing at least twice as tall as adult Link in ''Ocarina of Time''. Miyamoto mentioned that "we wanted Link to get inside of a wonderland, to experience the adventures and think hard about what he should do."<ref>{{cite web|author=Kris|publisher=GG8|year=November 12, 2000|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/111200.shtml|title=Miyamoto Interview|accessdate=September 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons]]'', the [[Triforce]] sends Link on a mission to another land, Holodrum, to stop the disruption of the seasons by the General of Darkness, [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons#Onox|Onox]]. While there, it is his duty to protect the Oracle of Seasons (in disguise as a dancer), named Din. After Onox takes her by force and the seasons are thrown into chaos, Link sets out to rescue her with the aid of the [[The Legend of Zelda series weapons and items#Rod of Seasons|Rod of Seasons]], a magical staff which allows Link to control the four seasons.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages]]'', Link awakens one day in another land, Labrynna, where he has been sent by the magic of the Triforce. Upon his arrival he is tricked by [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons#Veran|Veran]], the Sorceress of Shadows, into opening the seal protecting the Oracle of Ages, a singer named Nayru. Veran, possessing Nayru’s body and time-traveling powers, goes back in time to change the past and command the present. Link rushes to follow them to the past and save Nayru using the power of the [[The Legend of Zelda series weapons and items#Harp of Ages|Harp of Ages]], which, when played correctly, grants its user the ability to move back and forth through time. After exorcising Veran’s spirit from Nayru’s body, Link ascends her citadel to defeat Veran.

====2002–present====
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Four Swords]]'', a Zelda goes to the Sanctuary of the Four Sword with her friend Link to check on the seal containing the Wind Mage, [[Vaati]]. The seal has weakened, however, and Vaati emerges, kidnaps Zelda, and knocks out Link. Link awakens to find 3 Fairies, who instruct him to draw the four sword.  The magical Four Sword divideds him into 2-4 identical Links (depending on the number of players). The first Link wears his traditional green outfit; the second, a red version; the third, blue; and the fourth purple. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap]]'', released later, it is revealed that these colors reflect the four [[classical element|elements]] with which the sword is imbued: wind, fire, water, and earth, respectively. The Links must cooperate to overcome obstacles, collect keys, and storm Vaati’s Palace so they can rescue Zelda and seal the mage away again.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda.com|year=January 1, 2002|url=http://www.zelda.com/gba/swords_legend.html|title=The Legend|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:Linkfromtlozww.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Link as he appears in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]''.]] 
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'', set hundreds of years after ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'', the gods have flooded Hyrule. A new country has been formed, encompassing the islands of the Great Sea, which were once the highest mountaintops of Hyrule. The kingdom of old, lying dormant under the sea, is now a half-forgotten dream, barely surviving in ancient scrolls and dusty memories. In the beginning of the game, Link’s younger sister [[Aryll]] is captured by the [[Helmaroc King]] (a giant masked bird), who mistook her for someone else with golden hair and pointy ears. Link travels to all corners of the Great Sea to rescue his sister and defeat the shadowy power in control of the bird. He finds his quest intertwines with another, and Link becomes, after many trials, the “Hero of Winds”. Using the Wind Waker, a magical conductor’s [[baton]], he borrows the power of the gods to aid him in his quest. The wand’s user interface is similar to that used for the Ocarina of Time, but adds [[tempo]] as well as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] to form tunes.  He goes through many areas with difficult challenges to complete to not only save Aryll, but the world from the rising evil.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]]'', Zelda, who is again worried about the seal on Vaati, goes with six other mystical maidens to check on the Sanctuary of the Four Sword, and Link accompanies her. But something goes horribly wrong, and a dark shadowy copy of Link attacks. Link is forced to draw the Four Sword to fight this [[Dark Link|Shadow Link]], but when he does, he once again splits into copies of himself, and Vaati escapes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nintendo Power|publisher=Nintendo.com|year=June 7, 2004|url=http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1849&rp=1|title=The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap]]'', set before ''Four Swords'' and ''Four Swords Adventures'', Link is a young boy living with his grandfather, the Master Smith of Hyrule. Link is a childhood friend of [[Princess Zelda]], and on the day of Hyrule’s yearly fair to celebrate the coming of the [[Picori]], they go to join in the festivities. A mysterious stranger, [[Vaati]], shows up and wins the sword-fighting competition; each year the victor of this tournament has the honor of touching the sacred Picori Blade. This sword was a gift to the Hylians from the tiny Picori and was used long ago by a legendary hero (suggested to be a Link in the game's opening sequence, however his name was not "Link" his name was "Gustav", and some believe him to be the first Link) to defeat the forces of darkness and seal them away in the Bound Chest. Vaati destroys the blade and curses Zelda, and it is up to Link to repair the sword, defeat Vaati and save the princess.<ref>{{cite book | year=2004 | editor=Nintendo | title=The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap | pages=3-4 | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref> By the end of the game, the Picori Blade becomes the Four Sword, which Link seals Vaati in, setting the scene for the previously released ''Four Swords'' games.

[[Image:NewLink.png|right|thumb|150px|Link as he appears in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]''.]]
''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', released in November 2006 for the [[Wii]] and a month later for the [[GameCube]], is set "centuries"<ref>{{cite web|title=Mr. Miyamoto and Mr. Aonuma Reveal the Identity of the Mystery Woman|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=May 18, 2005 |url=http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=7164eddd-2039-4944-920b-d0731be99e05}}</ref> after the events of ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'' and ''Majora's Mask'', in an [[alternate timeline]] to ''The Wind Waker''.<ref name="nintendori154zelda">[http://www.nindori.com/interview/154zelda/154int_02.html "Interview with Eiji Aonuma"] (Japanese) [Partial translation: "ND – About when is the Twilight Princess timeline set?

Link’s rescue mission leads him into the Twilight Realm, a dark place that changes him into a wolf. While in this form, he is aided by [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess#Midna|Midna]], an imp-like creature, and learns why the Twilight invaded this world from Princess Zelda. Yet, in his attempt to save his friends, Link discovers an even greater evil that only he can stop. During the game, Link travels in the normal world in his human form and in the Twilight Realm in his wolf form.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass]]'', the latest title in the series, was released June 23, 2007 in [[Japan]]. It revives the idea of a fairy companion as in ''Ocarina of Time'' and ''Majora's Mask''. A direct sequel to ''The Wind Waker'', it involves the same Link and his quest to reunite with Tetra after both are lost at sea in a mysterious fog.

===Non-''Zelda'' appearances===
Link is present in a number of games outside of the ''Legend of Zelda'' series.
While varying in their regard within the gaming community, none of these games contribute anything to the series which would be considered ''The Legend of Zelda'' [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

''[[Link: The Faces of Evil]]'', released in 1993 for [[Philips]]’ [[CD-i]] system, is the only one of the three Zelda games for the CD-i system in which Link is the protagonist. At the beginning of the game, Link is visited by a wizard who tells him that Ganon and his servants have seized the peaceful island of Koridai and captured Zelda. After being informed that only he can defeat Ganon, Link travels to Koridai to find the magical artifact known as the ''Book of Koridai''. Using the Book, he defeats Ganon and frees Zelda. Although it features ''Zelda'' characters, this game was not produced, nor supervised by Nintendo, which also does not officially recognize the game as part of the ''Zelda'' series.

There were two other ''Legend of Zelda'' games released for the CD-i; ''[[Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon]]'' and ''[[Zelda’s Adventure]]''. However, in both games Princess Zelda was the protagonist, as in both games the plot involves Link’s kidnapping.

Link is one of eight characters available at the beginning of Nintendo’s 1999 fighting game, ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' Link sports his traditional green Kokiri tunic (the player can also choose from several alternate tunic colors inspired by Link's ''Ocarina of Time'' tunics: the red [[Races of The Legend of Zelda series#Goron|Goron]] Tunic and blue [[Races of The Legend of Zelda series#Zora|Zora]] Tunic along with a purplish-white and a black tunic). He also has some of his usual arsenal from ''The Legend of Zelda'' series at his disposal, including bombs, his boomerang and a hookshot.

Link is also one of the 14 playable characters available from the start in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', the 2001 sequel to ''Super Smash Bros.'' In ''Melee'', he has his bow in addition to the equipment he brought with him to the original ''Super Smash Bros''. Also playable in the game, as a secret unlockable character, is '''Young Link''', the youthful Link from most of the games in the series. Modeled after the ''Ocarina of Time''/''Majora’s Mask'' version of the hero, Young Link is more agile but weaker than the older Link. 

On May 10, 2006, at an after-hours press conference during [[E³]], Link became one of the first confirmed fighters in the [[Wii]] installment of the franchise, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. His appearance was influenced by his character model from ''Twilight Princess''. It is still unknown if an alternate version of Link, similar to Young Link in ''Melee'', will appear in ''Super Smash Bros Brawl''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peer Schneider & Matt Casamassina|publisher=IGN|year=May 10, 2006|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/707/707504p1.html|title=E3 2006: Super Smash Bros. Brawl|accessdate=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In the GameCube version of [[Namco]]’s ''[[Soul Calibur II]]'', the adult-style Link is a playable fighter. Not much is revealed about the incarnation of Link in this game, but it is known that, after saving Hyrule from an evil wizard who was being controlled by a fragment of [[Soul Edge]], he went on a quest to destroy the evil sword. Quickly pulling the Master Sword out of its pedestal, he set out to travel to this world to destroy Soul Edge, on a secret mission arranged by Princess Zelda. Miyamoto did not see a problem with Link appearing in what some had thought to be a "violent fighting game", since he had already been established as a fighter in the Super Smash Brothers games.<ref name="creation">{{cite web|author=Chris Leyton|publisher=Total Video Games.com|year=February 26, 2003|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/news/The_Miyamoto_Interview_3946_0_1.htm|title=The Miyamoto Interview [ News ]|accessdate=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref> And the more realistic Link in this game was used to help develop ''Twilight Princess's'' Link.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=Computer and Video Games|year=May 16, 2003|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/140503.shtml|title=The Miyamoto Interview |accessdate=September 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref>
In Soul Calibur II, Link is the only character to use ranged weapons and the only guest character to have his own theme and more than two costumes (he starts with his traditional green Kokiri tunic and the red [[Races of The Legend of Zelda series#Goron|Goron]] Tunic; the blue [[Zora]] Tunic and purplish-white tunic are unlockable) He uses a number of weapons from the Zelda games.

===Cameo appearances===
{{main|The Legend of Zelda series#References in other games}}
Among [[SNES]] games, Link made a notable appearance in [[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]], where he is sleeping in a bed at one of the Inns. There is also a reference to Link in the SNES [[Final Fantasy: Dawn of Souls]]; in Elftown there is a grave marked "Here Lies Link".  He also appears in  [[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' and [[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble!]]'', with a reference to Link's collection of seashells in [[Link's Awakening]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Fryguy64|publisher=Nintendo Database|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/sns/a3c_cam.shtml|title=Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Also, some of Link's weapons and items have shown up in different games, such as the [[Master Sword]] appearing in [[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Paden Brown|publisher=gamewinners.com|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://www.gamewinners.com/game_boy_advance/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance.htm|title=Hint: Legend Of Zelda reference: |accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> [[The Legend of Zelda]] has been parodied in the [[WarioWare]] series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chaim Gingold|publisher=the international journal of computer game research|year=October 1, 2005|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/0501/gingold/|title=What WarioWare can teach us about Game Design |accessdate=September 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Other media===
{{seealso|The Legend of Zelda series manga}}
[[Image:Zeed2.jpg|thumb|left|Link, as he appeared in the cartoon]]
[[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)]] Link, as voiced by [[Jonathan Potts]], was featured in a set of cartoons which aired from 1989-1990 as a part of [[DiC]]’s [[Super Mario Bros. television series|''The Super Mario Bros. Super Show'']]. Based loosely on the first game, the series presented Link as a rude, lovesick teenager, an image many find at odds with his silent persona from the video games. Constantly pursuing Zelda and pursued by the fairy princess Spryte, this Link was known to beg kisses from Zelda, and, famously, to burst out “Well excuuuuuse me, Princess!” when fed up with Zelda’s attitude, very different from his polite and respectful attitude in the original games. Thirteen episodes were produced before the cancellation of ''The Super Mario Bros. Super Show''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=zeldalegacy.net|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://www.zeldalegacy.net/zelda-multimedia/zelda-videos/legend-of-zelda-cartoon-series--downloads.html|title= Legend of Zelda Cartoon Series & Downloads|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The complete series was released [[October 18]], [[2005]] to very poor reviews.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt|publisher=X-Entertainment|year=May 26, 2001|url=http://www.x-entertainment.com/messages/562.html|title=Captain N, The Game Master: Joins Link & Zelda For A Little Moblin Action in Hyrule!|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> A slightly altered version of this Link (and Zelda) appeared during the second season of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael S.

A serial comic was created for ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine by acclaimed [[manga]] author [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], and later collected in graphic novel form. This told an alternate version of the events from ''A Link to the Past''. Though Link starts out a hapless, bumbling kid, caught up in something bigger than he ever imagined, he displays great courage and ultimately proves himself a determined and competent adventurer. Interestingly, he also has a fairy guide and companion, Epheremelda, long before this concept was introduced to the series. This telling portrays Link’s parents as Knights of Hyrule, lost to the Dark World. It also includes an original character, Roam, a descendant of the Knights of Hyrule who fought in the Imprisoning War. (Roam bears a striking resemblance to 002, a character from Ishinomori’s first successful creation, [[Cyborg 009]], whose real name, coincidentally, was Jet Link.) At the end of the story, Zelda has become Queen, and Link is head of the Royal Guard and the Knights of Hyrule. This success is bittersweet, as their duties keep them apart, even though they were once so close, sharing an adventure and even coming together in dreams.<ref name="manga">{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda Shrine|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://zs.ffshrine.org/link-to-the-past/manga.php|title=Zelda a Link to the Past - Manga / Comics|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> There have also been manga based on the original ''The Legend of Zelda'', ''Ocarina of Time'', ''Majora's Mask'', ''Oracle of Ages'', ''Oracle of Seasons'', ''Four Swords Adventures'' and ''The Minish Cap''<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda Shrine|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://www.zeldalegacy.net/zelda-literature--material/zelda-comics--manga/zelda-comics-and-manga.html|title=Zelda Comics and Manga|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

In the manga Link is portrayed as a heroic and selfless character throughout all of the versions. The different versions of him all had some unique personality traits, however. The version from ''Ocarina of Time'' and ''Majora's Mask'' had a desire to see the world outside of Kokiri Village. Also, in ''Majora's Mask'' Link was portrayed as a forgiving character. But, he was angry with the skull kid for all of the trouble he caused while wearing [[Majora's Mask]]. Knowing that the mask was the real cause of the problems, however, he  saved the Skull Kid when the mask tried to kill him. In the ''Oracle of Seasons'' manga there was a conflict over what Link wanted to do with his life. That Link's grandfather wanted Link to become a knight, while Link wanted to live his own life. Link would conflict with his grandfather over this. Link had overcome this problem by the beginning of the ''Oracle of Ages'' manga. In ''Four Swords Adventures'', the four Links had a lot of trouble working together because of their different personalities, but they eventually were able to overcome this problem.
