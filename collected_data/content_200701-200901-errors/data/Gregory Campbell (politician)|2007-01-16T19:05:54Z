'''Gregory Lloyd Campbell''' (born [[February 15]], [[1953]]) is a [[Northern Ireland]] [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] politician, and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] [[member of Parliament|member]] of the [[British parliament]] for [[East Londonderry (constituency)|East Londonderry]]. 

Campbell was raised in [[Derry]]'s Waterside area and was educated at Derry Technical College and the [[Magee College|University of Ulster (Magee College site)]]. He joined the DUP in the [[1970s]] and was first elected to [[Derry City Council|Londonderry County Borough Council]] in [[1977]]. Campbell briefly stepped down in [[1984]] when the council changed its name to Derry City Council, although before he returned to his seat not long after and still holds it.

He soon built a reputation as the DUP's leading figure in the North-West of the province and was chosen to contest the [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle constituency]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|general election of 1983]]. He contested the same seat again in the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]], although each time he finished second behind [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] leader [[John Hume]]. 

Given that Foyle had a predominantly [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] population, the increasingly high profile Campbell was transferred to the more winnable East Londonderry seat, where he ran unsuccessfully in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]]. Campbell won the seat at his second attempt in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], gaining a majority of 1,901 over sitting MP [[William Ross (Northern Ireland politician)|William Ross]] of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. He was re-elected in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], this time securing an increased majority of 7,498 over the new UUP candidate David McClarty. He is also a member of the currently-suspended [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], topping the Londonderry East poll (from which 6 members are elected) in both the [[Northern Ireland Assembly Election, 1998|1998 election]] and in [[Northern Ireland Assembly Election, 2003|that of 2003]]. He was appointed Minister of Regional Development in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] in July [[2000]].
