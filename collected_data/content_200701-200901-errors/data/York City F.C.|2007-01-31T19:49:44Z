'''York City Football Club''' are an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club founded in [[1922]] and are based in [[York]], [[North Yorkshire]]. The club has spent much of its history in [[The Football League]], rising on occasion as far as the old [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. However, since [[2004]] they have been playing in the [[Conference National]].

They have enjoyed more success in cup competitions, with highlights including an 
[[FA Cup]] semi-final appearance in 1955. Without doubt, City's most unlikely and most celebrated result came in the second round of the [[1995-96 in English football|1995/96]] [[Football League Cup|Coca-Cola Cup]], with a 3-0 away drubbing of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], who went on to win the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] double that season.

==History==
Some sources state the roots of York City Football Club can be traced back as far back as [[1897]] when the [[York Football League|York and District League]] was formed as [[football (soccer)|association football]] was beginning to gather popularity.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/content/articles/2005/09/15/york_city_history_sport_feature.shtml BBC.co.uk]</ref>

In the [[York|City of York]], there was a team named York City Football Club who were founded in [[1903]].<ref>[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/York_City/York_City.htm HistoricKits.co.uk]</ref> They first joined the [[Northern League (football)|Northern League]] in [[1908]] and played there for two seasons, before leaving to form the Yorkshire Combination (a proto-[[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]]). The club turned professional in [[1912]] and joined the [[Midland Football League|Midland League]]. The team played in the Midland League for three seasons, rising as high as tenth position. They played their final season in 1914-15 as [[World War I]] was upon the nation, the club was folded in [[1917]] during the war.<ref>[http://www.fchd.info/YORKC-1.HTM Football Club History Database]</ref>.

For reasons unknown, this part of York City's history is rarely acknowledged, the club themselves state the founding date as [[1922]], even though the men who re-founded the club in [[1922]] were involved with the original York City.

===Refounding: FA Cup semi-finalists===
The club was re-founded in [[1922]] by members of the former club who founded a [[limited company]] and gained admission to the [[Midland Football League|Midland League]]. They played in the Midland League for seven seasons, finishing as high as sixth, during both 1924-25 and 1926-27.<ref>[http://www.fchd.info/YORKC.HTM Football Club History Database]</ref>

[[Image:YCFC1922.jpg|right|thumb|250px|York City squad of [[1922]].]]
The club was elected to the national [[The Football League|Football League]] in 1929. They played originally at [[Fulford]]gate, before moving to their present home of [[KitKat Crescent|Bootham Crescent]], in 1932. This ground would be later re-branded "''[[Kit Kat|KitKat]] Crescent''", in late [[2004]].

City spent 29 years of their history in [[Football League Third Division North|Division Three North]], from 1929-30 to 1957-58 including the years in which [[World War II]] took place where the league was postponed. The club didn't begin to end their seasons very high up the table until the [[1950s]], they reached fourth in both 1952-53 and 1954-55 seasons. 

In the cup competitions the club fared better, and built a reputation for "''giant killing''". This can be traced back to the [[1937-38 in English football|1937/38]] season [[FA Cup]] tournament, the club were playing in the [[Football League Third Division]] at the time, but managed to knock out first division [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], before meeting [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in the quarter-final, City drew the quarter-final 0-0 but went out after losing the replay 2-1 at [[Leeds Road]].<ref>[http://www.yorkcityfc.com/history/brief_history.php Red and blue net] {{en icon}}</ref>

Perhaps the club's biggest achievement came when they reached the [[FA Cup]] semi-final in the [[1954-55 in English football|1954/55]] season. A campaign in which [[Arthur Bottom]] scored 8 goals for the club, and the team disposed of a [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] side which featured [[Stanley Matthews]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/content/articles/2005/09/15/york_city_history_sport_feature.shtml BBC] {{en icon}}</ref> After drawing 1-1 against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the semi-final, York took Newcastle to a replay; a match in which City were eventually defeated 2-0.

York City became founding members of [[Football League Fourth Division]] as [[Football League Third Division North|Division Three North]] and [[Football League Third Division South|South]] were merged. During the leagues formative season City missed out on the runner-up due to [[goal difference|goal average]], they were however promoted to [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]].

After their first season in [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] they were relegated straight back down. They spent the next four seasons in [[Football League Fourth Division|Division Four]], before being promoted in the mid-[[1960s]] but they were relegated straight back down again after only one season.

This time they stayed in Division Four for five seasons before being promoted in the early-[[1970s]]. This time City stayed up, and were promoted in the 1973-74 season to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. This was the highest the club had ever been, they spent two seasons in that league and were matched up against some of the country's most famous clubs, including [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

Unfortunately for City and their fans, this was followed up with three of their worst consecutive league finishes in their entire history under ex-Manchester United manager Wilf McGuinness, who fulfilled his promise to take City out of the second division. The following season they finished bottom of [[Division Three]] and narrowly avoided relegation from [[Football League Fourth Division|Division Four]] after ending the season 22nd.

===Return of the Giant Killers: Arsenal fall===
They managed to stabilize themselves slightly, spending nearly a decade in Division Four. The early to mid [[1980s]] were a positive time for York. They were crowned fourth division champions in 1983-84, becoming the first ever team to score 100 points in the English football league in the process, and followed it up with two top half finishes in Division Three.

But their biggest success came, when their giant killing reputation that they earned in the [[1930s]] returned. In January 1985, York City recorded a shock result in the Fourth Round of the FA Cup by beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1-0 at Bootham Crescent thanks to a penalty by [[Keith Houchen]] - who in May 1987 scored one of [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]'s goals against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the FA Cup final.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030301/ai_n12673063/pg_2 Find Articles] {{en icon}}</ref>

===City rising up the League: Manchester United beaten===
[[Image:Yorkcityoldlogo.jpg |right|thumb|150px|York City Football Club crest: 1978-2002.]]
During the 1992-93 season the [[English football league system]] was reorganised as the [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] was introduced. City had spent 5 years at the same league level, but pulled themselves up to the [[Football League Second Division]] after winning the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] playoffs in 1993, beating Crewe Alexandra in the final. Here they would stay for six seasons, during their first of which they were very nearly promoted to [[Football League First Division|Division One]] but they lost to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the playoff semi finals.

However, they did record one of the great shock victories of the [[1990s]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] Second Round. York City beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 3-0 at [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]] during the [[1995-96 in English football|1995/96]] season. The United team included the likes of [[David Beckham]], [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Philip Neville|Phil Neville]] and others, this was the Manchester United team which went on to win the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] and [[FA Cup]] double the same season.<ref>[http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/archive/library2005/ycfcoldtrafford/display.var.936400.0.when_city_rocked_the_world.php When City Rocked The World]</ref>

York City followed it up the following season, with another shock result. This time [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] were the victims in the Second Round. They drew the first leg 1-1 at [[Goodison Park]]; Neil Tolson took the lead for City but [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] pulled one back.<ref>[http://www.toffeeweb.com/SEASON/96-97/reports/yorkct_h.htm ToffeeWeb.com - 1st Leg]</ref> The second leg was a more intense affair at [[KitKat Crescent|Bootham Crescent]]. Everton fielded a strong team, including the aforementioned Kanchelskis as well as [[Gary Speed]] and [[David Unsworth]]; City won the game 3-2 with [[Graeme Murty]] scoring the goal which separated the two sides.<ref>[http://www.toffeeweb.com/SEASON/96-97/reports/yorkct_a.htm - 2nd Leg]</ref>

===Relegations and Financial difficulties===
During the early [[2000]]s York City struggled both on and off the pitch. By 2001, they had dropped to [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and financial difficulties had placed the club under threat of liquidation. Long-time chairman [[Douglas Craig]] announced in December of that year, that unless a new owner was found before [[April 1]] [[2002]], City would be resign from the football league.

A huge campaign was launched to save the club, which found support not only from City fans and York residents, but also from football fans across the country. Honda Integrity Racing Team owner, [[John Batchelor (racing)|John Batchelor]] took over from Craig as the new chairman. Batchelor promised the club much, but after more financial controversy regarding funds promised to City which went undelivered, a loyal group of  York City supporters formed the “''Supporters’ Trust''” stepped in to save the club and took over in [[2003]]. 

Although the club's finances now seem more secure, they were relegated to the [[Football Conference]] at the end of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003/04]] season. At the time they were also facing eviction from Bootham Crescent, to make way for a housing development. This situation has now been averted due to the Supporters’ Trust taking ownership of the club, and the club re-gaining ownership of the ground.[[Image:Ycfc.jpg|thumb|right|York City Football Club]]

==Recent times==
York City's six-year stay in Division Two ended when they were relegated in 1999, and manager Alan Little was sacked after nearly seven years in charge. His successor [[Neil Thompson]] lasted just one season, in which York struggled near the foot of Division Three, and Thompson's successor [[Terry Dolan]] had little success in his three-year reign.

[[Chris Brass]], a 27-year-old defender, became the youngest-ever manager in league football when he became player-manager of York City in [[May 2003]]. An impressive start to the [[2003-04 in English football|2003/04]] Division Three campaign gave fans hope for a promotion challenge, and come Christmas a playoff place still looked a real possibility. But York failed to win any of their final 20 league fixtures and were relegated to the [[Football Conference|Conference]] after 75 years of [[The Football League|league]] membership. 

Things got worse the next season, as the side got through three managers (Brass was sacked in November, despite being still at the bottom of his learning curve, [[Viv Busby]] spent four months in charge and was then replaced by [[Billy McEwan]]) and underwent the worst season of any team immediately after relegation from the Football League (excluding [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], who went out of business in 1989 before they could complete their first Conference season). The team eventually finished in the lowly position of 17th.

The [[2005-06 in English football|2005/06]] season looked more promising for York, as Scottish manager Billy McEwan started to see the rewards of an intelligent transfer policy and adventurous tactics. Eventually, York City finished in 8th place in the Conference in the 2005/06 season, narrowly missing out on the playoffs. In October 2005 Nick Bassett became Club Secretary.

===Current season===
Several of the first team squad members were released at the end of the 2005/06 season. Top goalscorer [[Andy Bishop]] left the club in May [[2006]] to join [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] on a free transfer. Since the end of the season McEwan has rebuilt, signing new players [[Darren Craddock]], [[Steve Bowey]], [[Craig Farrell]], [[David McGurk]] (a defender who had been on loan at York three times in the last two years), [[Anthony Lloyd]] and [[Ross Greenwood (footballer)|Ross Greenwood]].

City had mixed fortunes in their pre-season friendlies, losing their first few matches, until they beat Yorkshire rivals [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] 2-0.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/y/york_city/results/default.stm BBC Sport] {{en icon}}</ref> York had an impressive start to the 2006/07 season remaining unbeaten for 5 games, before losing away to [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]] 3-0 on [[September 9]] [[2006]], after goalkeeper Evans was dismissed early on. City continue to be one of the best supported sides in the Conference National, averaging around 2,800 fans at home and 4-500 loyal away fans.
