'''Bengali''' or '''Bangla''' ([[Help:IPA|IPA]]: {{Audio-IPA|hi-Bangla.ogg|[ˈbaŋla]}}) is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[language]] of the eastern [[Indian subcontinent]], evolved from the [[Magadhi Prakrit]], [[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages.

Bengali is native to the region of eastern [[South Asia]] known as [[Bengal]], which comprises present day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]]. With nearly 230 million total speakers, Bengali is one of the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]] (ranking 5th<ref name="eth"/> or 6th<ref name="encarta"/> in the world).

}}</ref> Along with [[Assamese language|Assamese]], it is geographically the most eastern of the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].

The Bengali language, with its long and rich literary tradition, serves to bind together a culturally diverse region.  In 1952, when Bangladesh used to be [[East Pakistan]], this strong sense of identity led to the [[Bengali Language Movement]], in which several people braved bullets and died on [[February 21]].  This day has now been declared as the [[International Mother Language Day]]. 

==History==

Like other [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan languages]], Bengali arose from the eastern [[Middle Indic languages]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. [[Magadhi Prakrit]], the earliest recorded [[spoken language]] in the region and the language of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], had evolved into [[Ardhamagadhi]] ("Half Magadhi") in the early part of the first millennium CE. Ardhamagadhi, as with all of the Prakrits of North India, began to give way to what are called [[Apabhramsa]] languages just before the turn of the first millennium.<ref name="tb">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000}}</ref> The local Apabhramsa language of the eastern subcontinent, Purvi Apabhramsa or [[Abahatta|Apabhramsa Abahatta]], eventually evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups: the [[Bihari languages]], the [[Oriya language|Oriya languages]], and the Bengali-Assamese languages. Some argue for much earlier points of divergence—going back to even 500 CE<ref>{{Harv|Sen|1996}}</ref> but the language was not static; different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects. For example, Magadhi Prakrit is believed to have evolved into Apabhramsa Abahatta around the 6th century which competed with Bengali for a period of time.<ref name="abahatta">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/A_0001.htm Abahattha] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref>

Usually three periods are identified in the history of Bengali:<ref name="tb">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000}}</ref> 
# Old Bengali (900/1000 CE–1400 CE)—texts include ''[[Charyapada]]'', devotional songs; emergence of pronouns ''Ami'', ''tumi'', etc; verb [[inflection]]s -''ila'', -''iba'', etc. [[Oriya language|Oriya]] and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] branch out in this period.
# Middle Bengali (1400–1800 CE)—major texts of the period include [[Chandidas]]'s ''[[Srikrishnakirtan]]''; [[elision]] of word-final ''ô'' sound; spread of compound verbs; Persian influence. Some scholars further divide this period into early and late middle periods.
# New Bengali (since 1800 CE)—shortening of verbs and pronouns, among other changes (e.g. ''tahar'' → ''tar'' "his"/"her"; ''koriyachhilô'' → ''korechhilo'' [[Grammatical person|he/she]] [[grammatical tense|had]] [[grammatical aspect|done]]).

Historically closer to [[Pāli|Pali]], Bengali saw an increase in [[Sanskrit]] influence during the Middle Bengali ([[Chaitanya]] era), and also during the [[Bengal Renaissance]]. Of the modern [[Indo-European languages]] in South Asia, Bengali and [[Marathi]] maintain a largely Sanskrit vocabulary base while [[Hindi]] and others such as [[Punjabi]] are more influenced by [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].

Until the 18th century, there was no attempt to document the grammar for Bengali. The first written Bengali dictionary/grammar, ''Vocabolario em idioma Bengalla, e Portuguez dividido em duas partes'', was written by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[missionary]] [[Manoel da Assumpcam]] between 1734 and 1742 while he was serving in [[Bhawal]].<ref name="firstgram">{{cite web

Bengali was the focus, in 1951–52, of the [[Bengali Language Movement]] (''Bhasha Andolon'') in what was then [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]).<ref>{{Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=62–63}}</ref> Although Bengali speakers were more numerous in the population of [[Pakistan]], [[Urdu]] was legislated as the sole national language.

===Dialects===
{{main|Bengali dialects}}

Regional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a [[dialect continuum]]. Linguist [[Suniti Kumar Chatterjee]] grouped these dialects into four large clusters &mdash; Radh, Banga, Kamarupa and Varendra;<ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> but many alternative grouping schemes have also been proposed.<ref name="morshed">{{cite web

}}</ref> The south-western dialects (Radh) form the basis of standard colloquial Bengali, while Bangali is the dominant dialect group in Bangladesh. In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern and south-eastern Bengal ([[Barisal]], [[Chittagong]], [[Dhaka]] and [[Sylhet]] divisions of Bangladesh), many of the stops and affricates heard in West Bengal are pronounced as [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]. Western [[postalveolar consonant|palato-alveolar]] affricates চ [{{IPA| tʃ}}], ছ [{{IPA| tʃʰ}}], জ [[{{IPA|dʒ}}]] correspond to eastern {{Unicode| চʻ}} [{{IPA|ts}}], ছ় [{{IPA|s}}], {{Unicode|জʻ}} [{{IPA|dz}}]~[[{{IPA|z}}]]. The influence of [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] on the phonology of Eastern Bengali is seen through the lack of nasalized vowels. Some variants of Bengali, particularly [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]] and [[Chakma language|Chakma Bengali]], have contrastive [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words.

[[Rajbangsi language|Rajbangsi]], Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, [[Hajong language|Hajong]] is considered a separate language, although it shares similarities to Northern Bengali dialects.<ref name="hajong">{{cite web

During the standardization of Bengali in the late 19th and early 20th century, the cultural center of Bengal was its capital [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta). What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the West-Central dialect of [[Nadia District|Nadia]], a district located near Kolkata.<ref name="daniul">{{cite web

# ''Shadhubhasha'' (সাধু ''shadhu'' = 'chaste' or 'sage'; ভাষা ''bhasha'' = 'language') was the written language with longer verb inflections and more of a [[Sanskrit]]-derived (তৎসম ''tôtshôm'') vocabulary. Songs such as India's national anthem ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' (by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) and national song ''[[Vande Mātaram]]'' (by [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]]) were composed in Shadhubhasha. However, use of ''Shadhubhasha'' in modern writing is negligible, except when it is used deliberately to achieve some effect. 
# ''Choltibhasha'' (চলতিভাষা ) or ''Cholitobhasha'' (চলিত ''cholito'' = 'current' or 'running') , known by linguists as ''Manno Cholit Bangla'' (Standard Current Bangla), is a written Bengali style exhibiting a preponderance colloquial idiom and shortened verb forms, and is the standard for written Bengali now. This form came into vogue towards the turn of the 19th century, promoted by the writings of [[Peary Chand Mitra]] (''[[Alaler Gharer Dulal]]'', 1857),<ref name="alal">{{cite web

Linguistically, cholit bangla is derived from sadhu bangla through two successive standard linguistic transformations.

While most writings are carried out in cholit bangla, spoken dialects exhibit a far greater variety. South-eastern West Bengal, including Kolkata, speak in manno cholit bangla. Other parts of West Bengal and west Bangladesh speak in dialects that are minor variations, such as the Medinipur dialect characterised by some unique words and constructions. However, areas of Bangladesh, particularly the [[Chittagong]] region, speak in a dialect that bears very little superficial resemblance to manno cholit bangla, including an entirely different vocabulary. The difference is so much that a person from West Bengal will be very hard pressed to understand even a single sentence in a passage of this dialect. This is known as the [[Bongali]] sublanguage, or more informally as Chattagram bangla. Writers (such as [[Manik Bandopadhyay]] in [[Padmanodir Majhi]]) have used the Bongali dialect in writing conversations. Though formal spoken Bengali is modeled on manno cholit bangla, the majority of Bengalis are able to communicate in more than one [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] &mdash; often, speakers are fluent in choltibhasha and one or more Regional dialects.<ref name="SKumar"/>

Even in Standard Bengali, vocabulary items often divide along the split between the [[Muslim]] populace and the [[Hindu]] populace. Due to cultural and religious traditions, Hindus and Muslims might use, respectively, Sanskrit-derived and Perso-Arabic words. Some examples of lexical alternation between these two forms are:<ref name=Banglabetelco>{{cite web

==Writing system==
{{main|Bengali script}}
[[Image:Anandabazarsnap1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''[[Anandabazar Patrika]]'', a news daily published from Kolkata in Bengali.]]

The Bengali writing system is not purely [[alphabet]]-based such as the [[Latin script]]. Rather, it is written in the Bengali [[abugida]], a variant of the [[Eastern Nagari script]] used throughout Bangladesh and eastern India. It is believed to have evolved from a modified [[Brahmic family|Brahmic]] script around 1000 CE,<ref name="akhor">[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0140.htm Bangla Script] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> and is similar to the [[Devanagari]] abugida used for [[Sanskrit]] and many modern [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] languages such as [[Hindi]]. It has particularly close historical relationships with the [[Assamese script]] and the [[Oriya script]] (although the latter is not evident in appearance). The Bengali abugida is a [[cursive]] script with eleven [[grapheme]]s or signs denoting the independent form of nine [[vowel]]s and two [[diphthong]]s, and thirty-nine signs denoting the [[consonant]]s with the so called "inherent" vowels.<ref name="akhor">[http://banglapedia.org.bd/HT/B_0140.htm Bangla Script] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> The concept of capitalization is absent in Bengali writing system. There is no variation in initial, medial and final forms as in the Arabic script. The letters run from left to right on a horizontal line, and spaces are used to separate orthographic words.

Although the consonant signs are presented as segments in the basic inventory of the Bengali script,  they are actually orthographically syllabic in nature. Every consonant sign has the vowel অ {{IPA|['''ɔ''']}} (or sometimes the vowel ও {{IPA|['''o''']}}) "embedded" or "inherent" in it.<ref name=it46>{{cite web

}}</ref> For example, the basic consonant sign ম is pronounced {{IPA|['''mɔ''']}} in isolation. The same ম can represent the sounds {{IPA|['''mɔ''']}} or {{IPA|['''mo''']}} when used in a word, as in মত {{IPA|['''mɔ'''t̪]}} "opinion" and মন {{IPA|['''mo'''n]}} "mind", respectively, with no added symbol for the vowels {{IPA|['''ɔ''']}} and {{IPA|['''o''']}}. 

A consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than {{IPA|['''ɔ''']}} is orthographically realized by using a variety of vowel [[allograph]]s above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[Typographical ligature|ligature]]. These allographs, called ''kar''s (cf. Hindi ''matra''s) are dependent vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph মি {{IPA|['''mi''']}} represents the consonant {{IPA|['''m''']}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|['''i''']}}, where {{IPA|['''i''']}} is represented as the allograph ি and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs মা {{IPA|['''ma''']}}, মী {{IPA|['''mi''']}}, মু {{IPA|['''mu''']}}, মূ {{IPA|['''mu''']}}, মৃ {{IPA|['''mri''']}}, মে {{IPA|['''me''']}}/{{IPA|['''mæ''']}}, মৈ {{IPA|['''moj''']}}, মো {{IPA|['''mo''']}} and মৌ {{IPA|['''mow''']}} represent the same consonant ম combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. It should be noted that in these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called "inherent" vowel is expunged from the consonant, but the basic consonant sign ম does not indicate this change.

To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''hôshonto'' (্‌), may be added below the basic consonant sign (as in ম্‌ {{IPA|['''m''']}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. 

Three other commonly used diacritics in the Bengali are the superposed ''chôndrobindu'' (ঁ), denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalization]] of vowels (as in চাঁদ {{IPA|['''tʃãd''']}} "moon"), the postposed ''onushshôr'' (ং)  indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|['''ŋ''']}} (as in বাংলা {{IPA|['''baŋla''']}} "Bengali") and the postposed ''bishôrgo'' (ঃ) indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|['''h''']}} (as in উঃ! {{IPA|['''uh''']}} "ouch!"). 

The vowel signs in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant,  the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in মই {{IPA|['''moj''']}} "ladder" and in ইলিশ {{IPA|['''iliʃ''']}} "Hilsa fish", the independent form of the vowel ই is used (cf. the dependent form ি). A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realized using its independent form.

The [[Bengali consonant clusters]] (যুক্তাক্ষর ''juktakkhor'' in Bengali) are usually realized as [[Typographical ligature|ligatures]], where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. There are more than 400 such consonant clusters and corresponding ligatures in Bengali. Many of their shapes have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more "transparent" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognize both the new "transparent" and the old "opaque" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.

Bengali punctuation marks, apart from the ''daŗi'' (|), the Bengali equivalent of a full stop, have been adopted from Western scripts and their usage is similar. <ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref>

Whereas in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms hang from a visible horizontal headstroke called the ''matra'' (not to be confused with its Hindi cognate ''matra'', which denotes the dependent forms of Hindi vowels). The presence and absence of this ''matra'' can be important. For example, the letter ত {{IPA|['''tɔ''']}} and the numeral ৩ "3" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster ত্র {{IPA|['''trɔ''']}} and the independent vowel এ {{IPA|['''e''']}}. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible ''matra'' and an invisible baseline).

[[Image:Tagoresignature.png|thumb|right|250px|Signature of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] &mdash; an example of [[penmanship]] in Bengali.]] 

===Spelling-to-pronunciation inconsistencies===
In spite of some modifications in the nineteenth century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters (শ, ষ, and স) for the [[voiceless palato-alveolar fricative]] {{IPA|['''ʃ''']}}, although the letter স does retain the [[voiceless alveolar fricative]] {{IPA|['''s''']}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in স্খলন {{IPA|['''skʰɔlon''']}} "fall", স্পন্দন {{IPA|['''spɔndon''']}} "beat", etc. There are two letters (জ and য) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|['''dʒ''']}} as well. What was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal ণ {{IPA|['''ɳ''']}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|['''n''']}} (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as ট, ঠ, ড and ঢ), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|['''æ''']}} is orthographically realized by  multiple means, as seen in the following examples: এত {{IPA|['''æt̪o''']}} "so much", এ্যাকাডেমী {{IPA|['''ækademi''']}} "academy", অ্যামিবা {{IPA|['''æmiba''']}} "amoeba", দেখা {{IPA|['''d̪ækha''']}} "to see", ব্যস্ত {{IPA|['''bæst̪o''']}} "busy", ব্যাকরণ {{IPA|[bækɔron]}} "grammar". 

The realization of the inherent vowel can be another source of confusion. The vowel can be phonetically realized as {{IPA|['''ɔ''']}} or {{IPA|['''o''']}} depending on the word, and its omission is seldom indicated, as in the final consonant in কম {{IPA|['''kɔm''']}} "less".

Many consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants ক্‌ {{IPA|['''k''']}} and ষ {{IPA|['''ʃɔ''']}} is graphically realized as ক্ষ and is pronounced {{IPA|['''kʰːo''']}} (as in রুক্ষ {{IPA|['''rukʰːo''']}} "rugged") or {{IPA|['''kʰo''']}} (as in ক্ষতি {{IPA|['''kʰot̪i''']}} "loss") or even {{IPA|['''kʰɔ''']}} (as in ক্ষমতা {{IPA|['''kʰɔmot̪a''']}} "power"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.

For a detailed list of these inconsistencies, consult [[Bengali script]].

===Uses in other languages===
The Bengali script, with a few small modifications, is also used for writing [[Assamese language|Assamese]]. Other related languages in the region also make use of the Bengali alphabet. [[Meitei language|Meitei]], a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language used in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], has been written in the Bengali abugida for centuries, though [[Meitei Mayek script|Meitei Mayek]] (the Meitei abugida) has been promoted in recent times. The script has been adopted for writing the [[Sylheti]] language as well, replacing the use of the old Sylheti Nagori script.<ref name="sylnagri">{{cite web

In the context of Bangla [[Romanization]], it is important to distinguish between 
[[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]].  Transliteration is orthographically accurate
(i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas 
transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation
can be reproduced).  
Since English does not have the sounds of Bangla, and since pronunciation does not completely reflect the spellings, being faithful to both is not possible. 

Although it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bangla orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bangla words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia mixed a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the pronunciation is represented with no reference to how it is written. The Wikipedia Romanization is given in the table below, with the [[help:IPA|IPA]] transcriptions as used above.

===Diphthongs===
Magadhan languages such as Bengali are known for their wide variety of [[diphthongs]], or combinations of [[vowel]]s occurring within the same [[syllable]].<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=116}}</ref> Several vowel combinations can be considered true monosyllabic diphthongs, made up of the main vowel (the '''nucleus''') and the trailing vowel (the '''off-glide'''). Almost all other vowel combinations are possible, but only across two adjacent syllables, such as the disyllabic vowel combination {{IPA|[u.a]}} in কুয়া ''kua'' "well". As many as 25 vowel combinations can be found, but some of the more recent combinations have not passed through the stage between two syllables and a diphthongal monosyllable.<ref>{{Harv|Chatterji|1926|pp=415–416}}</ref>

===Stress===
In standard Bengali, [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as '''''shô'''-ho-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' "cooperation", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress. The first syllable carries the greatest stress, with the third carrying a somewhat weaker stress, and all following odd-numbered syllables carrying very weak stress. However in words borrowed from Sanskrit, the root syllable is stressed, causing them to be out of harmony with native Bengali words.<ref name="suniti_stress">{{Harv|Chatterji|1921|pp=19–20}}</ref>

Adding [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es to a word typically shifts the stress to the left. For example, while the word '''''shob'''-bho'' "civilized" carries the primary stress on the first syllable ['''shob'''], adding the [[negation|negative]] prefix [ô-] creates '''''ô'''-shob-bho'' "uncivilized", where the primary stress is now on the newly-added first syllable অ '''''ô'''''. In any case, word-stress does not alter the meaning of a word and is always subsidiary to sentence-stress.<ref name="suniti_stress">{{Harv|Chatterji|1921|pp=19–20}}</ref>

===Intonation===
For Bengali words, intonation or pitch of voice has minor significance, apart from a few isolated cases. However in sentences intonation does play a significant role.<ref>{{Harv|Chatterji|1921|pp=20}}</ref> In a simple [[declarative sentence]], most words and/or phrases in Bengali carry a rising [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]],<ref name="inton0">{{Harvnb|Hayes|Lahiri|1991|pp=56}}</ref> with the exception of the last word in the sentence, which only carries a low tone. This [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]al pattern creates a musical tone to the typical Bengali sentence, with low and high tones alternating until the final drop in pitch to mark the end of the sentence.

In sentences involving [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]ed words and/or phrases, the rising tones only last until the focused word; all following words carry a low tone.<ref name="inton0">{{Harvnb|Hayes|Lahiri|1991|pp=56}}</ref> This intonation pattern extends to [[wh-questions]], as wh-words are normally considered to be focused. In yes-no questions, the rising tones may be more exaggerated, and most importantly, the final syllable of the final word in the sentence takes a high falling tone instead of a flat low tone.<ref name="inton1">{{Harvnb|Hayes|Lahiri|1991|pp=57–58}}</ref>

===Vowel length===
[[Vowel length]] is not contrastive in Bengali; all else equal, there is no meaningful distinction between a "[[short vowel]]" and a "[[long vowel]]",<ref name>{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=6}}</ref> unlike the situation in many other Indic languages. However, when [[morpheme]] boundaries come into play, vowel length can sometimes distinguish otherwise homophonous words. This is due to the fact that [[open syllable|open]] [[syllable|monosyllables]] (i.e. words that are made up of only one syllable, with that syllable ending in the main vowel and not a consonant) have somewhat longer vowels than other syllable types.<ref name="munier">{{Harv|Ferguson|Chowdhury|1960|pp=16–18}}</ref> For example, the vowel in ''cha:'' "tea" is somewhat longer than the first vowel in ''chaţa'' "licking", as ''cha:'' is a word with only one syllable, and no final consonant. (The long vowel is marked with a colon : in these examples.) The [[Affix|suffix]] ''ţa'' "the" can be added to ''cha:'' to form ''cha:ţa'' "the tea". Even when another morpheme is attached to ''cha:'', the long vowel is preserved. Knowing this fact, some interesting cases of apparent vowel length distinction can be found. In general Bengali vowels tend to stay away from extreme vowel articulation.<ref name="munier">{{Harv|Ferguson|Chowdhury|1960|pp=16–18}}</ref>

Furthermore, using a form of [[reduplication]] called "echo reduplication", the long vowel in ''cha:'' can be copied into the reduplicant ''ţa:'', giving ''cha:ţa:'' "tea and all that comes with it". Thus, in addition to ''cha:ţa'' "the tea" (long first vowel) and ''chaţa'' "licking" (no long vowels), we have ''cha:ţa:'' "tea and all that comes with it" (both long vowels).

===Consonant clusters===
{{main|Bengali consonant clusters}}

Native Bengali (''tôdbhôb'') words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as গেরাম ''geram'' (CV.CVC) for গ্রাম ''gram'' (CCVC) "village" or ইস্কুল ''iskul'' (VC.CVC) for স্কুল ''skul'' (CCVC) "school".

Sanskrit (তৎসম ''tôtshôm'') words borrowed into Bengali, however, possess a wide range of clusters, expanding the maximum syllable structure to CCCVC. Some of these clusters, such as the ''mr'' in মৃত্যু ''mrittu'' "death" or the ''sp'' in স্পষ্ট ''spôshţo'' "clear", have become extremely common, and can be considered legal consonant clusters in Bengali. English and other foreign (বিদেশী ''bideshi'') borrowings add even more cluster types into the Bengali inventory, further increasing the syllable capacity to CCCVCCCC, as commonly-used loanwords such as ট্রেন ''ţren'' "train" and গ্লাস ''glash'' "glass" are now even included in leading Bengali dictionaries.

Final consonant clusters are rare in Bengali.<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=126}}</ref> Most final consonant clusters were borrowed into Bengali from English, as in লিফ্‌ট ''lifţ'' "lift, elevator" and ব্যাংক ''bêņk'' "bank". However, final clusters do exist in some native Bengali words, although rarely in standard pronunciation. One example of a final cluster in a standard Bengali word would be গঞ্জ ''gônj'', which is found in names of hundreds of cities and towns across Bengal, including নবাবগঞ্জ ''Nôbabgônj'' and মানিকগঞ্জ ''Manikgônj''. Some nonstandard varieties of Bengali make use of final clusters quite often. For example, in some Purbo (eastern) dialects, final consonant clusters consisting of a nasal and its corresponding oral stop are common, as in চান্দ ''chand'' "moon". The Standard Bengali equivalent of ''chand'' would be চাঁদ ''chãd'', with a nasalized vowel instead of the final cluster.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Bengali grammar}}

Bengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are highly [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]].

As a consequence, unlike Hindi, Bengali verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.

===Word order===
As a [[Head directionality parameter|Head-Final]] language, Bengali follows [[Subject Object Verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name="tb16">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[postposition]]s, as opposed to the [[preposition]]s used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner (function)|Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=UCLA1>{{cite web

| title = Bengali
| accessdate = 2006-11-20

| publisher = University of California, Los Angeles
}}</ref>

Yes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Additionally optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. কি ''-ki'', না ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticized]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.

Wh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.

===Nouns===
Nouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name="tb">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000}}</ref> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as -টা ''-ţa'' (singular) or -গুলা ''-gula'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].

When counted, nouns take one of a small set of [[measure word]]s. As in many [[East Asian languages]] (e.g. [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], etc.), nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. The noun's measure word ('''MW''') must be used between the numeral and the noun. Most nouns take the generic measure word -টা ''-ţa'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. -জন ''-jon'' for humans).

|}

Measuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. আট বিড়াল ''aţ biŗal'' instead of আট'''টা''' বিড়াল ''aţ-'''ţa''' biŗal'' "eight cats") would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. শুধু এক'''জন''' থাকবে। ''Shudhu êk-'''jon''' thakbe.'' (lit. "Only one-'''MW''' will remain.") would be understood to mean "Only one '''person''' will remain.", given the semantic class implicit in -জন ''-jon''.

In this sense, all nouns in Bengali, unlike most other Indo-European languages, are similar to [[mass noun]]s.

===Verbs===
Verbs divide into two classes: [[finite verb|finite]] and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honor]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200. 

[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]]. 

Bengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus "he is a teacher" is ''she shikkhôk'', (literally "he teacher").<ref name="hacche-bangali">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkhôk hochchhe''. This is viewed as ungrammatical by other speakers, and speakers of this variety are sometimes (humorously) referred as "hochchhe-Bangali".</ref> 
In this respect, Bengali is similar to [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

==Vocabulary==
[[Image:Bengali Vocabulary2.gif|thumb|Sources of Bengali words{{legend|#FFCC99|Tôtshômo (Sanskrit Reborrowings)}}{{legend|#993300|Tôdbhôbo (Native)}}{{legend|#FF6666|Bideshi (Foreign Borrowings)}}|180px|right]]
{{main|Bengali vocabulary}}

Bengali has as many as 100,000 separate words, of which 50,000 (67%) are considered ''tôtshômo'' (direct reborrowings from Sanskrit), 21,100 (28%) are ''tôdbhôbo'' (derived from Sanskrit words), and the rest being ''bideshi'' (foreign) and ''deshi'' words.

However, these figures do not take into account the fact that a large proportion of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimizing their actual usage. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of ''tôdbhôbo'' words, while ''tôtshômo'' only make up 25% of the total.<ref name="bhoumick">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/T_0087.htm Tatsama] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref><ref name="bhoumick1">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/T_0010.htm Tatbhava] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> ''Deshi'' and ''Bideshi'' words together make up the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern Bengali literature.

Due to centuries of contact with [[European ethnic groups|European]]s, [[Mughals]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Persians]], [[ethnic Pashtuns|Afghans]], and [[East Asians]], Bengali has [[Loanword|borrowed]] many words from foreign languages. The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. Close contact with neighboring peoples facilitated the borrowing of words from [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and several indigenous [[Austroasiatic languages]] (like [[Santali language|Santali]]).<ref>[[Byomkes Chakrabarti]] ''A Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali'', K.P. Bagchi & Co., Kolkata, 1994, ISBN 8170741289 </ref> of Bengal. After centuries of invasions from [[Persia]] and the [[Middle East]], numerous [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Pashtun language|Pashtun]] words were absorbed into Bengali. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]] words were later additions during the [[British Raj|colonial period]].
