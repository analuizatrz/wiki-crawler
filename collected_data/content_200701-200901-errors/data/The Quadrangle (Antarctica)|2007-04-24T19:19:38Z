'''The Quadrangle''' ({{coor dm|71|35|S|68|36|W|}}) is an ice-covered area (essentially a glacial cirque) enclosed on three sides by rock ridges, but open to the south, lying between [[Mount Umbriel]] and [[Venus Glacier]] in eastern [[Alexander Island]]. Mapped by Directorate of [[Overseas Surveys]] from satellite imagery supplied by [[U.S. National Aeronautics]] and [[Space Administration]] in cooperation with [[U.S. Geological Survey]]. The feature was so named by [[United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] (UK-APC) in description of its shape.
