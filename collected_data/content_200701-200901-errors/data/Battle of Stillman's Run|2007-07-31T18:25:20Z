The '''Battle of Stillman's Run''', also known as the '''Battle of Sycamore Creek''' or the '''Battle of Old Man Creek''', was the first armed confrontation between the forces of the [[Illinois]] [[Militia]], and [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]]'s Sauk Indian Band. The battle would end in an unexpected victory for Black Hawk, but it would seal the fate of his followers.

==Background==

Black Hawk, and his followers, referred to as the "British Band", because of its earlier support to the [[United Kingdom|British]] during the [[War of 1812]] and continuing reliance on British trading, had been pushed out, by treaties and military force, from their lands in and around [[Saukenuk]] (now [[Rock Island, Illinois]]. Attempting to reclaim their land, Black Hawk recrossed the [[Mississippi River]] eastward on [[April 5]], [[1832]]. Along with him were 1,000 followers. Half of these were combatants. The rest were a combination of women, children, and elderly. The Band consisted of [[Sauk]], [[Fox]], with some [[Potawatomi]] and [[Kickapoo]]. The reasons for crossing into [[Illinois]] varied, but overall, the band wanted to reclaim lands, and perhaps, to create a confederacy of Indians for mutual support. Alleged promises of aid from other Illinois Indian tribes were made to the British Band. Black Hawk also believed that promises were made by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Canada]], helping the Band gain confidence for their course of action. 

Soon they marched along the [[Rock River]] into Illinois territory. Illinois Governor [[John Reynolds (U.S. politician)|John Reynolds]] viewed the return of Black Hawk as an invasion, and immediately called up the [[Militia]], and requested Federal support. The expedition was turned over to U.S. General [[Henry Atkinson]], who Black Hawk would address as "White Beaver." Atkinson did not attempt to attack the band, noting that Black Hawk's band had not committed any act of violence. But when diplomacy failed to bring Black Hawk back's Band west, a detachment of Illinois Militia directly controlled by the governor, was marched up the Rock River. 

By now, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and an Indian confederacy had collapsed. There would be no one to aid him or his followers. The British Band had begun to weaken with hunger.  The Sauk Chief soon realized that the only option left was to go back. He discovered an American milita camp eight miles away from this. Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to surrender his band. They were told to wave a white flag at the Americans.

==Battle==
On [[May 14]], [[1832]], Isaiah Stillman's detachment of 275 militia were resting after a long march in the summer heat. They had been detached from the main force commanded by General Samuel Whiteside camped near present day [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]] [[Dixons Ferry]] to scout farther up the Rock River.  During the march, the militia had dumped supplies along the way. They were a disorganized rabble. When the detachment made camp, they proceeded to get drunk. Their camp was located about three miles east of the Rock River in present day [[Stillman Valley, IL]], in northeastern Ogle County.  

Black Hawk sent five emissaries to approach the camp under a flag of true in order to negotiate a peace with the soldiers.  The soldiers killed two of the Indians as they approached the camp and captured the remaining three.  Upon arriving at Major Stillman's camp, the three captured Indians make an escape attempt.  Soldiers shot at the three escapees, killing one.  The other two fled back toward their camp located near the confluence of the [[Rock River (Illinois)|Rock]] and [[Kishwaukee River|Kishwaukee]] Rivers. 

The soldiers were so intent on pursuing the escaping prisoners that they chased them back toward the main force of Black Hawk's warriors.  Black Hawk and his force concealed themselves and ambushed the pursuers from Stillman's force.  The soldiers, believing that thousands of Indians were chasing them, panicked and fled all of the way back to the main force camped at Dixon's Ferry.  The actual number of Indians is estimated to have been about 40.  (Eleven soldiers are reported to have been killed, although only six graves are to be found at the gravesite.) 

The remains of the slain soldiers were later located and buried near the site of the battlefield on a small bluff overlooking what would later be named Stillman Creek.  A memorial, erected in 1901, stands near their graves today.

==Aftermath==

Armed hostilities began at Stillman's Run. Black Hawk realized that the whites would seek revenge, and only a total Indian defeat would appease the Americans. Leading his starving band, Black Hawk would have to flee from the pursuing army of Atkinson. The chase would take them as far as present day [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and end at the [[Battle of Bad Axe]], where a combined force of whites would massacre a weakened foe, by then, made up of mostly women and children.
