The GM [[EV1]] was an electric vehicle that was offered for lease only in the 1990's, before being unceremoniously scrapped. The [[Holden Statesman]] (1971 - 1985) was originally marketed as the General Motors statesman.

== History ==
{{main|History of General Motors}}

General Motors (GM) was founded on [[September 16]], [[1908]] in [[Flint, Michigan]], as a [[holding company]] for [[Buick]], then controlled by [[William C. Durant]], and acquired [[Oldsmobile]] later that year. The next year, Durant brought in [[Cadillac]], [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore]], [[Oakland automobile|Oakland]] (later known as Pontiac) and several others. In 1909, General Motors acquired the Reliance Motor Truck Company of [[Owosso, Michigan]], and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of [[Pontiac, Michigan]], the predecessors of [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck]]. Durant lost control of GM in 1910 to a bankers' trust, because of the large amount of debt taken on in its acquisitions coupled with a collapse in new vehicle sales. A few years later, Durant would start the [[Chevrolet]] Motor car company and through this he secretly purchased a controlling interest in GM. Durant took back control of the company after one of the most dramatic [[proxy wars]] in American business history. Shortly after, he again lost control for good after the new vehicle market collapsed. [[Alfred Sloan]] was picked to take charge of the corporation and led it to its post war global dominance. This unprecedented growth of GM would last through the late 70's and into the early 80's.

The General Motors Aftermarket Business in the US manages four brands; Goodwrench, ACDelco, GM Performance Parts and GM Accessories. GM Aftersales operates globally.

== Marketing in the United States ==
At one time, each of GM's automotive divisions in the United States were targeted to specific market segments and despite some shared components, each distinguished itself from its stablemates with unique styling and technology. The shared components and common corporate management created substantial [[economy of scale|economies of scale]], while the distinctions between the divisions created an orderly upgrade path, with an entry-level buyer starting out with a practical and economical [[Chevrolet]] and moving through offerings of the different divisions until the purchase of a [[Buick]] or [[Cadillac]].

The postwar automobile industry became enamoured with the concept of "[[planned obsolescence]]", implemented by both technical and styling innovations with a typical 3-year product cycle. In this cycle, a new basic body shell is introduced and then modified for the next two years with minor styling changes. GM, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] competed vigorously in this new restyling environment.

=== Distinguishing the brands ===
By 1958, the divisional distinctions within GM began to blur with the availability of high-performance engines in [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Pontiac]]s. The introduction of higher trim models such as the [[Chevrolet Impala]] and [[Pontiac Bonneville]] priced in line with some [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Buick]] offerings was also confusing to consumers. By the time [[Pontiac]], [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Buick]] introduced similarly styled and priced compact models in 1961, the old "step-up" structure between the divisions was nearly over.

=== Compacts arrive ===
The decade of the 1960s saw the creation of compact and intermediate classes. The [[Chevrolet Corvair]] was a 6-cylinder answer to the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], the Chevy II was created to match Ford's conventional [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]] and the [[Chevrolet Camaro]]/[[Pontiac Firebird]] was GMs counter measure to the [[Ford Mustang]]. Among intermediates, the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] nameplate became so popular during the 1970s that [[Oldsmobile]] applied the Cutlass name to most of its products in the 1980s. By the mid 1960s, most of GM's vehicles were built on a few common ''platforms'' and in the 1970s GM began to use nearly identical body panel stampings, differing only in internal and external trim items. 

The 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega]] was GM's launch into the new subcompact class. Problems associated with its innovative [[aluminum]] engines would damage GMs reputation more than perhaps any other vehicle in its history. During the late 1970s, GM would initiate a wave of [[downsizing]] starting with the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] which was reborn into what was the size of the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], the Malibu would be the size of the Nova, and the Nova was replaced by the troubled front-wheel drive [[Chevrolet Citation]].

=== Rebadging era ===
By the 1980s, GM frequently "rebadged" one division's successful vehicle into several models across the divisions, all positioned close to one another in the market place. Thus a new GM model's main competition might be another model spawned off the same platform. This led to market "[[Cannibal#Other uses of the word|cannibalization]]" with the divisions spending time stealing sales from one another. Even today, the company's GMT360 mid-sized light truck platform has spawned the basic [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]], [[Oldsmobile Bravada]], [[GMC Envoy]], [[Isuzu Ascender]], [[Buick Rainier]] and [[Saab 9-7X]]. Though each model had a more or less distinct mission, the trucks can hardly be discerned from one another. 

=== GM in the new century ===
In the late 1990s, the U.S. economy was on the rise and GM and [[Ford]] gained market share producing enormous profits primarily from the sale of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles. From 2000 to 2001, the [[Federal Reserve]] in a move to quell the stock market, made twelve successive interest rate increases. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], a severe stock market decline caused a pension and benefit fund underfunding crisis.   GM began its ''Keep America Rolling'' campaign, which boosted sales, and other auto makers were forced to follow suit. The U.S. automakers saw sales increase to leverage costs as gross margins deteriorated. Although retiree health care costs remain a significant issue, General Motors' investment strategy has generated a $17.1 billion surplus in 2007 in its $101 billion U.S. pension fund portfolio, a $35 billion reversal from its $17.8 billion of underfunding.<ref>Sloan, Allan (April 10, 2007).[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/09/AR2007040901262.html GM's High-Performance Pension Machine] ''Washington Post'', D02.</ref>

In 2004, GM redirected resources from the development of new sedans to an accelerated refurbishment of their light trucks and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s for introduction as 2007 models in early 2006. Shortly after this decision, fuel prices increased by over 50% and this in turn affected both the trade-in value of used vehicles and the perceived desirability of new offerings in these market segments. The current marketing plan is to extensively tout these revised vehicles as offering the best fuel economy ''in their class'' (of vehicle). GM claims its hybrid trucks will have gas-mileage improvements of 25%. 

In the summer of 2005, GM announced that its corporate chrome emblem "[[Mark of Excellence]]" will begin appearing on all recently introduced and all-new 2006 model vehicles produced and sold in North America. The move is seen as an attempt by GM to link its name and vehicle brands more closely. 

In 2005, GM promoted sales through an employee discount to all buyers. Marketed as the lowest possible price, GM cleared an inventory buildup of 2005 models to make way for its 2006 lineup. While the promotion was a temporary shot in the arm for sales, it did not help the company's bottom line. GM has since changed its marketing strategy to a no haggle sticker policy in which all vehicle prices are lowered, but incentives are reduced, if not eliminated.

=== GM in China ===
General Motors is the best selling auto maker in [[China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060105/AUTO01/601050436/1148|title=GM becomes top-selling foreign automaker in China|work=[[Detroit News]]|accessmonthday=April 10 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> The [[Buick]] brand is especially strong, led by the [[Buick Excelle]] subcompact. [[Cadillac]] initiated sales in [[China]] in 2004, starting with imports from the [[United States]]. GM pushed the marketing of the [[Chevrolet]] brand in [[China]] in 2005 as well, moving the former [[Buick Sail]] to that marque. The company manufactures most of its China-market vehicles locally, through its [[Shanghai GM]] joint venture. Shanghai GM, a joint venture between the Chinese company SAIC and General Motors, was created on March 25, 1997. The Shanghai GM plant was opened December 15, 1998 when the first Chinese-built Buick came off the assembly line. The [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile]] joint-venture is also successful selling trucks and vans under the [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile|Wuling]] marque.GM plans to create a research facility in Shanghai for $250m to develop hybrid cars and alternative energy vehicles.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/29/business/gm.php "GM plans a research center in Shanghai for hybrid technology"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', October 29, 2007</ref>

== Subsidies ==
In March 2005, the [[Government of Canada]] provided [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 million in incentives to General Motors for its Ontario plants to expand production and provide jobs, according to [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]]. Similar incentives were promised to non-North American auto companies like Toyota, Premier Dalton McGuinty said the money the province and Ottawa are pledging for the project is well-spent.

== Labor relations ==
{{main|2007 General Motors strike}}   
On [[September 24]], [[2007]] General Motors workers represented by the [[United Auto Workers]] union went on the first nationwide strike against GM since 1970. The ripple effect of the strike reached into Canada the following day as two car assembly plants and a transmission facility were forced to close. However, overnight a tentative agreement was reached and UAW officials declared the end of the strike in a news conference at 4 a.m. on [[September 26]]. By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.

=== Outcome of strike ===
A new labor contract was ratified by UAW members exactly one week after the tentative agreement was reached, passing by a majority 62% vote. In the contract are several product and employment guarantees stretching well into the next decade. One of GM's key future products, the Chevy Volt, was promised to the GM Poletown/Detroit-Hamtramack plant in 2010. Also included is a VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association) which will transfer retiree health care obligations to the UAW by 2010. This eliminates more than 50 billion dollars from GM's healthcare tab. It will be funded by 30 billion in cash and 1.4 billion in GM stock paid to the UAW over the next 4 years of the contract. It also eliminates 70% of the labor cost gap with GM's Japanese rivals.

== Auto racing ==
General Motors has an extensive history in numerous forms of racing. Vehicles of most, if not all, of GM's brands have been represented in competition, with perhaps [[Chevrolet]] being the most prominent. In particular, the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] has long been popular and successful in international road racing. GM also is a supplier of racing components, such as engines, transmissions, and electronics.

GM's [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] engine platform was successful in open-wheel Indy-style racing throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small [[V8 engine|V-8]] class. An unmodified Aurora V-8 in the Aerotech, captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the [[Cadillac V-Series]] has entered motorsports racing. GM has also used many cars in the American racing series [[NASCAR]]. Currently the [[Chevrolet Impala]] is the only entry in the series but in the past the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Buick Regal]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Chevrolet Lumina]],  [[Chevrolet Malibu]], and the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] were also used.

In touring cars (mainly in Europe) [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] is a key player and former champion in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC) series and competes with a [[Vauxhall Vectra]] in Super 2000 spec. [[Opel]] used to participate in the [[DTM]] series. [[Chevrolet]] competes with a [[Daewoo Lacetti|Lacetti]] in the [[FIA]] [[World Touring Car Championship]] (WTCC).

In [[Australia]], there is the prestigious [[V8 Supercar]] Championship which is battled out by the two main rivals of [[Holden]]& [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The current [[Holden]] Racing Team cars are based on the [[Holden Commodore]] and run a 5.0-litre V8-cylinder engine producing 650+BHP (approx 480 kW Power) @ 7500 rpm). These cars have a top speed of 300+km/h (185 mph) and run 0-100 km/h in less than 4 seconds. The [[Holden Racing Team]] is Australia's most successful team in Australian Touring Car History. In 2007 the Drivers championship was won by the very closely linked [[HSV Dealer Team]]

===Development of Electronics for GM Auto Racing===
In 1986, the GM Motorsports group asked [[Delco Electronics]] Corporation, a subsidiary of GM [[Hughes]] Electronics (headquarters - [[Kokomo, IN]]) if an electronic engine management system could be developed for the Chevy Indy V8 engines used in the [[CART]] open wheel racers. Delco Electronics had been supplying all GM automobiles sold in the USA with Engine Control Modules (ECMs) since 1981 when the USA [[Clean Air Act]] required 3-way [[catalytic converters]] and controlled [[air-fuel ratio]]s. The production ECMs were becoming more complex, and were becoming powertrain controllers controlling the transmission, spark timing, Idle speed, as well as air-fuel intake mixtures.

Delco Electronics used a small group of electronic designers and technicians at their facility in [[Goleta, CA]] (near [[Santa Barbara, CA]]) to do special assignable projects that were advanced or more state of the art. This facility was called Delco Systems Operations (formerly known as GM Defense Research Labs), a part of Delco Electronics Corporation at the time. Delco Systems Operations is the place where the [[Apollo Program]]'s Lunar Rover Mobility Sub-system<ref>Anthony Young, [http://lunarandplanetaryrovers.com/roverbook.htm Lunar and Planetary Rovers: The Wheels of Apollo and the Quest for Mars].
ISBN 0387307745</ref> was developed and built, also the Apollo Program's guidance computers ([[Apollo PGNCS]]) and the [[Boeing 747]] guidance computers ([[Delco Carousel]] IV) were developed and manufactured there. All Delco Electronics Motorsports products developed before 1994 were designed by this group. From 1994 to present, this activity is at Delco Electronics/[[Delphi]] in Kokomo, IN.

The first generation of engine management controller for [[CART]] racing used a modified production ECM, but performed poorly in the race car due to the harsh EMI ([[Electromagnetic Interference]]) environment. This version was never used in racing, but the experience gained enabled the engineers to design a more successful Generation 2 controller for use in the 1988 CART series.

[[Image:Mario Illien introduces the Gen II to Mario Andretti.jpg|thumb|Practice at Phoenix 1988. Mario Illien introduces the Gen II to Mario Andretti]]

Generation 2 controllers were used experimentally by the [[Newman-Haas Racing]] team in 1988 and the first win was in the Cleveland CART race with [[Mario Andretti]] driving.

In 1989 Newman-Haas Racing, [[Penske Racing]], and [[Patrick Racing]] teams used Delco Electronics Gen-2 controllers with the [[Ilmor]] Chevy Indy V8 engine. "By the start of the 1989 season, racing pundits recognized that Chevrolet, with its Ilmor Engineering engines  and Delco Electronics equipment, had assembled perhaps the most potent racing power in the history of the sport. As the season got under way in April, the pattern of winning began. Racing's elite drivers -- [[Unser]] junior and senior, Fittipaldi, [[Rick Mears]], and Mario Andretti -- were driving the best equipment in the world. 

The results began to show early on. By October, Chevy engines with DE equipment had won 13 of the 15 (CART) races.

[[Image:Watching the 1989 Indy 500 at Butler's Pizza in Goleta, CA.jpg|thumb|DSO Motorsports Management Group & Friends Watching the 1989 Indy 500 at Butler's Pizza in Goleta, CA]]

When [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] crossed the finish line to win the [[1989 Indianapolis 500]], racing fans witnessed history being made. Fans thrilled to the neck-and-neck finish between Fittipaldi and [[Al Unser Jr.]] who went spinning on lap 198 after brushing tires with Emmo, and the 43-year-old Barazilian had his first Indianapolis 500 win. Fittipaldi's victory -- in a Chevrolet Indy V8 engine controlled by a Delco Electronics electronic engine control module (ECM) -- was the first time in the 500's storied history that the engine of the winning vehicle was controlled by an electronic engine management system"<ref>Delco Electronics Electron Magazine, June 1994, pages 1-5</ref> 

[[Image:Gen-2 Conroller that was in the 1989 Indy 500 Winning Car.jpg|thumb|Gen-2 Conroller that was in the 1989 Indy 500 Winning Car]]

For the 1990 season, all teams using the Ilmor Chey Indy V8 were provided a redesigned Gen-3 system and it won 15 poles, 16 wins including the [[1990 Indianapolis 500]], with 17 races in the CART series. To prove the system, the components were used with [[GM engines]] in the [[Trans-Am]] Racing series during 1989.

In the 1991 CART season, Gen-3 had a perfect score: 17 poles, 17 wins, 17 races including the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]]. At the 1991 Indianapolis 500, Delco Electronics introduced [[telemetry]] to the electronic system using the advanced [[spread spectrum]] radio technology<ref>James Bogner, [http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/962327 SAE paper 962327 : Spread Spectrum Telemetry Data System for Indy Car Racing], October 1996.</ref> . It was so popular that all CART teams eventually used it, and many still use it. [[ABC TV]] used the data from the systems to display real time data with ABC's in-car video cameras.

In 1990 and 1991, the Chevy engine with the Delco Electronics Gen-3 controller won 33 straight CART events. Chevy's dominance proved electronics had found their place in CART racing.

In the 1992 CART season, race cars with Gen-3 captured 7 poles, 11 wins  including the [[1992 Indianapolis 500]], in 16 races.

For the 1993 CART season, Delco Electronics had been developing a smaller more powerful controller using 32-bit computers and a high-level software language called [[Modula]]-GM. This system was called Gen-4 and won much praise for its improved functions and features.  The telemetry system developed for the 1992 season was used, and a new Distributorless Ignition module component was added to the overall engine management system. 10 wins including the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]] in 16 CART races.

[[Image:Gen-1,Gen-2, Gen-3, Gen-4 Controller Modules Compared.jpg|thumb|Left to Right Gen-4, Gen-3, Gen-2, & Gen-1 Delco Electronics Motorsport Engine Control Modules]]
In 1994, a totally new Ilmor engine was introduced to CART teams and the engine controller was Delco Electronics Gen-4: 12 wins including the [[1994 Indianapolis 500]], 16 races.

In 1995, Gen-4 won 6 races out of 17. 

In 1996, the [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) split from CART and used the naturally aspirated [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] engine which used the Delco Electronics Gen-4 system until the engine was retired from IRL service a few years ago. 1997 was the last year the Gen-4 ran in the CART season.

Per a February 27, 2003 Delphi Press Release<ref>Delphi's Innovative Earpiece Sensor System Becomes Safety Requirement for Indy Racing League Drivers[http://delphi.wieck.com/pressSingle/value=DEL2005011379901]</ref>, Delphi's current involvement in open wheel racing is as follows:

"Delphi is the official electronics provider to the IRL and has been involved in open-wheel racing since 1988. Today, a majority of the vehicles in the IRL are equipped with several of Delphi's racing products including:

*Delphi Earpiece Sensor System - measures dynamic forces to a driver's head during an accident. It uses small sensors integrated into the left and right radio earpieces worn by the driver. The six accelerometers -- one for each of the three axes on each side -- measure acceleration in the X, Y and Z axes during an accident. The combined data from the earpiece sensor system and onboard accident data recorder provide accident researchers valuable data for a clearer picture of what happens during a crash.

*Accident Data Recorder (ADR2) - senses and records key vehicle parameters at 1,000 samples per second just prior to, during, and after an accident-triggering event.

*Track Condition Radio - helps alert drivers with critical information by transmitting messages from race control to the racecar. A dash-mounted display communicates messages including safety warnings, track condition and pits opened/closed.

*Radio Telemetry Module - transmits engine and chassis data from a speeding racecar to race team engineers located in the pits. The telemetry module helps enhance driver safety and race team strategy by making real-time data available.

*Multec(R) Bottom Feed Methanol Electronic Fuel Injector - provides a high flow rate and a low profile package that are ideal for port fuel racing applications. The injector is able to operate at high temperatures and provide a high level of spray atomization.

*Connectors, Cables and Terminals - connectors are coupling devices that provide an electrical and mechanical connection/disconnection in a system. Cables are insulated electrical conductors. Terminals are devices attached to the end of a wire to facilitate electrical connections. All of these Delphi components enable a vehicle's electrical/electronic system to function under the tough conditions in racing.

Delphi also has begun offering services to the racing industry, including Hydraulic Sled Testing from its state-of-the-art testing laboratory in Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi provides comprehensive safety testing using a hydraulic test sled to simulate a crash.

==Alternative fuels and hybrids==
General Motors is both active in environmental causes and, as a major industrial force, implicated in ecologically harmful activity. The company has long worked on alternative-technology vehicles, and has recently led the industry with clean burning Flexfuel vehicles that can run on either E-85 (ethanol) or [[gasoline]]. The company was the first to use [[turbocharger]]s and was an early proponent of [[V6]] engines in the 1960s, but quickly lost interest as the [[muscle car]] race took hold. They demonstrated <ref>[http://www.conklinsystems.com/firebird/mlife.php America's First Turbine Car]</ref> [[gas turbine]] vehicles powered by [[kerosene]], an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, GM pushed the benefits of [[diesel]] engines and [[cylinder deactivation]] technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the [[Oldsmobile]] diesels and drivability issues in the [[Cadillac]] 4-6-8 variable cylinder engines. In 1987 GM, in conjunction with [[Aerovironment]] built the [[Sunraycer]] which won the inaugural [[World Solar Challenge]] and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from [[Sunraycer]] found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by [[Aerovironment]] and was the predecessor to the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]].

GM supported a compromise version of the [[CAFE]] standard increase from 27 mpg to 35 mpg, the first such increase in over 20 years.<ref>[http://www.kpcnews.com/articles/2007/07/27/greater_fort_wayne/news/doc46a9e1f76229a445366384.txt GM workers lobbying for less-stringent CAFE rule<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
====Hybrid initiative====
{{Main|Plug-in hybrid|Chevrolet Volt}}

In May 2004, GM delivered the world's first full sized hybrid pickups, and introduced a hybrid passenger car. In 2005, the [[Opel Astra]] [[diesel]] [[hybrid vehicle|Hybrid]] [[concept vehicle]] was introduced. The 2006 [[Saturn VUE#Green Line|Saturn VUE Green Line]] was the first hybrid passenger vehicle from GM and is also a mild design. GM has hinted at new hybrid technologies to be employed that will be optimized for higher speeds in [[freeway]] driving. Future hybrid vehicles should include the 2007 [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]], the [[Saturn Aura#Aura Green Line|Saturn Aura]], and an updated [[Saturn VUE#Second Generation|Saturn VUE]] based an [[Opel]] design like the Saturn Aura. 

GM has recently introduced the concept cars  [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Opel Flextreme]], which are electric vehicles with back-up generators, powered by gasoline, E85, or fuel cells. According to GM, a production Chevrolet Volt will be available by late 2010 as a 2011 model.

GM currently offers two types of hybrid systems. The first type, used in the Silverado Hybrid, Saturn VUE, Saturn Aura, and Chevrolet Malibu, is what GM calls a "Mild Hybrid" or "BAS" system. The second hybrid drive system,co-developed with [[DaimlerChrysler]] and [[BMW]], is called a "[[Two-Mode Hybrid]]."  The two-mode is used by the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon and will later be used on the Saturn VUE, and possibly other vehicles.

GM’s current hybrid models: 
*2008 [[Saturn VUE|Saturn VUE Green Line Hybrid]]
*2008 [[Saturn Aura|Saturn Aura Green Line Hybrid]]
*2008 [[GMC Yukon|GMC Yukon Hybrid]]
*2008 [[Chevrolet Malibu|Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid]]

The GM Magic Bus is a hybrid powered bus.<ref>{{cite web |title= GM's Hybrid Propulsion System for Transit Buses |url= http://www.gm.com/company/gmability/adv_tech/300_hybrids/index_bus.html |accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref>

GM sold 843 hybrids of all types during the first quarter of 2008, according to the industry newspaper [[Automotive News]].  Compared that with Ford, which sold 5,225 hybrids during that time. The hands-down hybrid leader, Toyota, sold 278,000 in the U.S. alone last year and 430,000 worldwide. CSM Worldwide, expects GM to seriously increase its hybrid output, turning the automaker into a serious contender within the next few years. He expects it to produce 40,000 to 50,000 hybrids this year, more than doubling last year's production. <ref>http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId=101846&topicId=104970025&docId=l:780869115</ref>

====Hydrogen initiative====
GM has prided its research and prototype development of [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen powered vehicles]], to be produced in early 2010, using a support infrastructure still in a prototype state. The economic feasibility of the technically challenging hydrogen car, and the low-cost production of hydrogen to fuel it, has also been discussed by other automobile manufacturers such as [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]]. In June 2007, Larry Burns, vice president of research and development, said he's not yet willing to say exactly when hydrogen vehicles will be mass produced, but he said it should happen before 2020, the year many experts have predicted. He said "I sure would be disappointed if we weren't there" before 2020.<ref>Tom Krisher, [http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8PP9U4G0.htm "GM steps up work on hydrogen cars"], ''[[Business Week]]''. June 15, 2007</ref>

====Flexfuel and biofuels====  
GM produces many Flexfuel vehicles that can operate on ethanol gasoline, or E85. GM has over 2 million FlexFuel vehicles on the road today in all 50 states. E85 is a mostly renewable fuel made from corn and grain products.

====Electric vehicles====
The process of obtaining the EV1, GM's first electric vehicle, was difficult. The vehicle could not be purchased outright. Instead, General Motors offered a closed-end lease for three years, with no renewal or residual purchase options.   The EV1 was only available from specialist Saturn dealerships, and only in California and Arizona.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/general-motors-ev1 General Motors EV1: Information and Much More from Answers.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Before reviewing leasing options, a potential lessee would be taken through a 'pre-qualification' process in order to learn how the EV1 was different from other vehicles. Next came a waiting list with no scheduled delivery date.<ref>[http://pages.prodigy.net/noela/myev.htm My EV experiences<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Several weeks before the debut of the movie, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] announced that its EV1 display was being permanently removed and the EV1 car put into storage. GM is a major financial contributor to the museum, but both parties denied that this fact contributed to the removal of the display.<ref>[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060711/AUTO01/607110368/1148 Detnews.com | This article is no longer available online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

General Motors has responded to complaints about the scrapping of the EV1 program and they dispute the existence of any conspiracy surrounding its demise. An entry was posted on the GM blog FastLane<ref>http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/ GM FastLane Blog</ref> in 2006 in which GM defended its decision by saying that it was unable to guarantee the vehicles could continue to be maintained in a safe operating state.<ref>[http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html GM FYI Blog: Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  

GM alleges that during the four years available to the public, only 800 EV1's were released. Over $1 billion was spent on the EV1 program, with a great portion used for consumer incentives and marketing. With a waiting list of 5,000 applicants, only 50 individuals actually were willing to accept a lease on the EV1. Suppliers ceased production of replacement parts due to the low demand for the EV1. This made repairs and continued safety of the vehicles difficult. The EV1 was designed as a developmental vehicle and was never intended for serial production. 

The limitations of storage technology and the expense of production would have made the cars impractical for the vast majority of consumers; a production EV1 would have met limited demand and would have been priced out of reach of most. Had sufficient demand existed to justify mass production and had costs and technologies been able to support mass production, GM would have been more receptive to the idea. 

GM responded to allegations made in the film through a blog post by Dave Barthmuss, who said "Sadly, despite the substantial investment of money and the enthusiastic fervor of a relatively small number of EV1 drivers — including the filmmaker — the EV1 proved far from a viable commercial success."<ref>[http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html ''Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?'']</ref> Barthmuss notes investments in electric vehicle technology since the EV1: [[Two-Mode Hybrid]], plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicle programs. The filmmakers suggested that GM did not immediately channel its technological progress with the EV1 into these projects, and instead let the technology languish while focusing on more immediately profitable enterprises such as SUVs. Contrary to this suggestion, as Barthmuss points out, GM is bullish on hydrogen:

According to GM, not all of the EV1's were destroyed. Many were donated to research institutions and facilities, along with museums. Some are still owned by General Motors themselves, and are kept at their technical design center in [[Warren, Michigan]], and can occasionally be seen on the road within a close area of the tech center.<ref>[http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html GM FYI Blog: Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After Toyota ceased production of the RAV-4EV in 2001, no other major automaker on the road offered a fully electric vehicle designed for everyday use on public transportation routes for some time;{{Fact|date=January 2008}}<ref>[http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html GM FYI Blog: Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> however [[Think Nordic]], at one time under the ownership of Ford, have produced a range of electric vehicles in limited numbers.  In 2007, Tesla Motors began taking orders for the fully electric Tesla Roadster, which was designed for less than 1/10th of the cost of the EV1.  Production on the Roadster began in March, 2008, and GM executives have expicitly stated that the emergence of the Tesla Roadster was a primary reason why GM accelerated the Chevy Volt project; the spiritual successor to the EV1.

==Political and charitable contributions==
In the 2006 election cycle General Motors contributed $788,600, with 34% of that amount going to the Democrats and 66% to the Republicans.<ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/contrib.asp?Ind=M02 Top Contributors to Federal Candidates and Parties: Automotive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since 1996, General Motors has been the exclusive source of funding for [[Safe Kids USA]]'s "Safe Kids Buckle Up" program, a national initiative to ensure child automobile safety through education and inspection.<ref>Safe Kids USA. [http://www.usa.safekids.org/tier2_rl.cfm?folder_id=3120 SK Buckle Up] usa.safekids.org. Retrieved 24/02/08.</ref>

== Corporate restructuring ==
After gaining market share in the late 1990s and making enormous profits General Motors stock soared to over $80 a share. However, in 2000, twelve successive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve led to a severe stock market decline following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], caused a pension and benefit funds crisis at General Motors and many other American companies. General Motor's rising retiree health care costs and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) fund deficit prompted the company to enact a broad restructuring plan. Although GM had already taken action to fully fund its pension plan, its OPEB fund became an issue for its corporate bond ratings. GM had expressed its disagreement with the bond ratings; moveover, GM's benefit funds were performing at higher than expected rates of return. Then, following a $10.6 billion loss in 2005, GM acted quickly to implement its restructuring plan. For the first quarter of 2006 GM earned $400 million, signaling a turnaround had already begun even though many aspects of the restructuring plan had not yet taken effect. Although retiree health care costs remain a significant issue, General Motors' investment strategy has generated a $17.1 billion surplus in 2007 in its $101 billion U.S. pension fund portfolio, a $35 billion reversal from its $17.8 billion of underfunding.<ref>Sloan, Allan (April 10, 2007).[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/09/AR2007040901262.html GM's High-Performance Pension Machine] ''Washington Post'', D02.</ref>

In February 2005, GM successfully bought itself out of a put option with [[Fiat]] for $2 billion USD (€1.55 billion). In 2000, GM had sold a 6% stake to [[Fiat]] in return for a 20% share in the Italian automaker. As part of the deal, GM granted [[Fiat]] a [[put option]] which, if exercised between January 2004 and July 2009, could have forced GM to buy [[Fiat]]. GM had agreed to the put option at the time, perhaps to keep it from being acquired by another automaker such as [[Daimler AG]] competing with GM's [[Opel]] and [[Vauxhall]] marques. The relationship suffered, and [[Fiat]] had failed to improve. In 2003, [[Fiat]] recapitalized, reducing GM's stake to 10%. 

In February 2006, GM slashed its annual dividend from 2.00 to $1.00 per share. The reduction saved $565 million a year. 

In March 2006, GM divested 92.36 million shares (reducing their stake from 20% to 3%) of Japanese manufacturer [[Suzuki]], in order to raise $2.3 billion. GM originally invested in [[Suzuki]] in the early 1980s. 

On [[March 23]], [[2006]], a private equity consortium including [[KKR]], [[Goldman Sachs]] Capital, and [[Five Mile Capital]] purchased $8.8 billion, or 78% of [[GMAC]], GM's commercial mortgage arm. 
The new entity, in which GMAC will own a 21% stake, will be known as Capmark Financial Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060323/NEWS11/60323002|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|title=article|accessmonthday=March 23 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On [[April 3]], [[2006]], GM announced that it would sell 51% of [[GMAC]] as a whole to a consortium led by [[Cerberus Capital Management]], raising $14 billion over 3 years. Investors also include [[Citigroup]]'s private equity arm and [[Aozora Bank]] of [[Japan]]. The group will pay GM $7.4 billion in cash at closing. GM will retain approximately $20 billion in automobile financing worth an estimated $4 billion over three years.

GM sold its 8% stake in [[Isuzu]] on [[April 11]], [[2006]], to raise an additional $300 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060411/UPDATE/604110423/1148/AUTO01 |title=GM sells Isuzu shares for $300 million|work=[[Detroit News]] |accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref>12,600 workers from [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]], a key supplier to GM, agreed to buyouts and an early retirement plan offered by GM in order to avoid a strike, after a judge agreed to cancel Delphi's union contracts. 5,000 Delphi workers were allowed to flow to GM.

On [[June 28]], [[2007]], GM agreed to sell its [[Allison Transmission]] division to [[private-equity]] firms [[Carlyle Group]] and [[Onex Corporation|Onex]] for $5.1 billion. The deal will increase GM's [[liquidity]] and echoes previous moves to shift its focus towards its core automotive business. The two firms will control seven factories around Indianapolis but GM will retain management of a factory in [[Baltimore]]. Former [[Allison Transmission]] president [[Lawrence E. Dewey]] will be the new CEO of the standalone company.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118303669648651430-search.html?KEYWORDS=gm+allison&COLLECTION=wsjie/6month GM Agrees to Sell Allison Transmission Unit], [[The Wall Street Journal]], 29 June 2007</ref>

On [[February 12]], [[2008]] GM announced its loss of $39 Billion. The biggest loss of any U.S. Automaker. GM has offered buyouts to all its UAW members.

==Criticism==
In 1980, J. Patrick Wright wrote a book named ''On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors.'' This book, which critics acclaimed "blows the lid off the king of carmakers" was about the allegations of corruption, "mismanagement and total irresponsibility" at the top level of the company, as seen by [[John DeLorean|John Z. DeLorean]], the Vice-President, who in 1973 resigned from his position in spite of a brilliant and meteoric rise (he was earning $ 650,000 per year and was expected to be the next President of GM).
