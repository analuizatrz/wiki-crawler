[[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard Entertainment's]] 1998 bestselling [[real-time strategy game]] '''''[[StarCraft]]''''' revolves around interstellar affairs in a distant sector of the galaxy, with three species and multiple factions all vying for supremecy in the sector. The original game has sold over 9.5 million copies<ref name="vivendi">{{cite web | url=http://www.vivendi.com/ir/download/pdf/VIVGames_EuropeRoadshow_June2006.pdf | title=Introduction to Vivendi games | date=June 2006 | publisher=[[Vivendi]] | accessdate=2006-11-26 | format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> internationally, making it one of the top selling games in the PC market. One of the reasons for ''StarCraft'''s success is its intricate story, carried by [[#Reception|generally positively recieved characters]] from the industry's reviewers and journalists. The ''StarCraft'' universe, comprising of a number of games, authorised add-ons and novels, has an extensive list of characters, but only a small number of these characters have a major influence of the overall story arc.

===Samir Duran===
[[Image:Samir Duran (StarCraft).gif|right]]

'''Samir Duran''' is one of the most mysterious beings in the ''StarCraft'' universe. Duran first appears as a leader of an anti-[[Terran Dominion|Dominion]] resistance force early in ''Brood War'' Episode V<ref name="ep5m1">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_1| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode V, mission 1 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>, and allies with the [[United Earth Directorate]]. Although Duran provides invaluable data on the Dominion to the UED, he also allows Zerg to overwhelm their strike forces on [[Aiur]], sabotaging the objectives of that mission<ref name="ep5m6">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_6| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode V, mission 6 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>. As a result, [[Alexei Stukov]] suspects him of being a traitor late in Episode V, at which point Duran kills him<ref name="ep5m7">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_7| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode V, mission 7 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> and shows that he is working with [[Sarah Kerrigan]]<ref name="ep5m8">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_8| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode V, mission 8 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>, revealing himself as an infested Terran.

With Duran as her advisor, Kerrigan successfully establishes herself as the dominant power in the sector, taking command of the majority of the Zerg Swarm in Episode VI. However, despite his valued assistance, Duran vanishes shortly before Kerrigan is attacked in ''Brood War'''s final mission. He is discovered by [[Zeratul]] in a secret mission on an unknown moon, engineering a Protoss/Zerg hybrid<ref name="ep6bonus"/>. At this point it is made clear that Duran is not working for Kerrigan, but for a much greater but unknown power.

Due to a lack of appearances in any other media, Duran's true nature is a mystery, and Blizzard Entertainment has not elaborated on his character. What is for certain is that Duran is highly intelligent and manipulative, demonstrating a degree of knowledge of Protoss technology<ref name="ep6bonus">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_bonus| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode VI, secret mission at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> and Zerg control hierarchy<ref name="ep5m3">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_3| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode V, mission 3 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>. He is able to fool the UED into thinking he is a thirty-three year old<ref name="BWmanual"/> human and Kerrigan into thinking he is infested when he is neither, although the means by which he accomplishes this are not known. Duran also claims to have "had many names throughout the millennia", displaying that he is far older than any other character in ''StarCraft''; even the extremely long lived Protoss rarely live over a single millennium. Fan speculations link Duran to nearly every faction and character in the game, but the most common theory is that he is a [[Xel'Naga]]. Duran's voice is provided by Paul Ainsley<ref name="BWcasting"/>.

===Aldaris===
[[Image:Aldaris (StarCraft).gif|right]]

'''Aldaris''' is a seven hundred and fourty year old<ref name="manual">{{cite book| last= Underwood| first=Peter| coauthors=Bill Roper, Chris Metzen and Jeffrey Vaughn| title=StarCraft (Manual)| location=Irvine, Calif. | publisher=Blizzard Entertainment| year=1998}}</ref> Judicator who provides instructions and advice to the player in the early missions of Episode III. He later returns to this role in the early missions of Episode IV. [[Paul Eiding]] provides the voice for the character of Aldaris in both ''StarCraft''<ref name="casting">{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217061/fullcredits#cast| title=Casting of ''StarCraft'' at the Internet Movie Database| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> and ''Brood War''<ref name="BWcasting"/>.

A fanatical believer in the Khala<ref name="manual"/>, Aldaris is outraged when [[Tassadar]] turns his back on the faith. After a failed attempt to capture the wayward Templar during the middle of Episode III, Aldaris leads the Conclave forces in an attack on Tassadar's allies, taking him prisoner and putting him on trial for crimes of [[blasphemy]] and [[treason]]. [[Zeratul]] interrupts the trial and rescues Tassadar, but allows a bitter Aldaris to escape. In the closing missions of the original game, Aldaris witnesses the rebels successfully assault  the [[Zerg|Zerg's]] core defences, and wishes them luck in their final battle<ref name="ep3m10">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_10| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode III, mission 10 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>.

In ''Brood War'', Aldaris reluctantly allies with Zeratul and Raszagal<ref name = "BWmanual"/> when the Protoss flee [[Aiur]] and travel to [[Shakuras]]. However, when [[Sarah Kerrigan]] is accepted as an ally during Episode IV, Aldaris is furious and does not accompany the expeditionary fleet<ref name="ep4m4">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e4_4| title=Transcipt of dialogue for Episode IV, mission 4 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>. In the fleet's absence he discovers Raszagal is being mentally controlled by Kerrigan and takes a legion of Khalai refugees and attacks her citadel. The player's character repels the attack, and Aldaris is eventually slain by Kerrigan<ref name="ep4m7">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e4_7| title=Transcipt of dialogue for Episode IV, mission 7 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> in Episode IV's penultimate mission before he can warn his comrades of her schemes.

===Gerard DuGalle===
[[Image:Gerard DuGalle (StarCraft).gif|right]]

'''Gerard DuGalle''' is a top-ranked [[United Earth Directorate]] [[admiral]] and an experienced battlefield commander. Aged sixty-four<ref name="BWmanual"/>, he is the head of the expeditionary force sent to take control of the Koprulu Sector in ''StarCraft: Brood War''<ref name="BWmanual">{{cite book| last= Underwood| first=Peter| coauthors=Chris Metzen and Bill Roper| title=StarCraft: Brood War (Manual)| location=Irvine, Calif. | publisher=Blizzard Entertainment| year=1998}}</ref>. DuGalle is voiced by [[James Harper (actor)|James Harper]]<ref name="BWcasting">{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296870/fullcredits#cast| title=Casting of ''StarCraft: Brood War'' at the Internet Movie Database| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>.

DuGalle is a staunch believer in the UED's mission and carries out his orders with precision. Despite a twelve-year age gap, he is also a childhood friend of his [[vice-admiral]], [[Alexei Stukov]]<ref name="BWmanual"/>. Despite his experience, DuGalle is prone to believe faulty intelligence from [[Samir Duran]] throughout Episode V and thus causes Stukov to abandon the fleet<ref name="ep5m6"/>. DuGalle accepts Duran's theory that Stukov is a traitor and allows Duran to kill his friend<ref name="ep5m7"/>, only realizing his horrible mistake too late. The true traitor Duran vanishes after Stukov's death, but DuGalle is still successful in capturing the Overmind and occupying the majority of the sector by the end of Episode V<ref name="ep5m8"/>. However, as a result of demoralization, limited manpower, and an alliance of enemies led by [[Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]], the fleet is slowly but surely pushed back throughout Episode VI, and when a last-ditch attempt to recapture [[Char (StarCraft)|Char]] fails, DuGalle and the fleet retreat. In ''Brood War'''s final cinematic, DuGalle composes a letter to his wife, informing her of the fleet's failure and taking full responsibility for Stukov's death<ref name="DuGalleletter">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_movie1 | title=Transcript of DuGalle's suicide letter at ''StarCraft'' Legacy| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>. DuGalle then commits suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, after which the UED fleet is ovetaken by Zerg and destroyed.

DuGalle's character appearance is supposedly based on that of a character named Lester in an original ''StarCraft'' cinematic. In third party map editors, he is known as "recruit" in reference to Lester, although the official editor does not have a unit for DuGalle.

===Edmund Duke===
[[Image:Edmund Duke (StarCraft).gif|right]]

'''Edmund Duke''' was originally a [[general]] in the [[Terran Confederacy|Confederate]] Security Forces, but during the course of ''StarCraft'' Episode I Duke defects with his forces, Alpha Squadron, to the Sons of Korhal. The fifty-three year old<ref name="manual"/> Terran is voiced by Chris Metzen in both ''StarCraft''<ref name="casting"/> and ''Brood War''<ref name="BWcasting"/>. A member of one of the influential Confederate Old Families, he is portrayed in the games and the novels as a "by the book" leader<ref name="manual"/> but also as a humourless and xenophobic man. Despite this, he is considered by other characters as a competent military commander. Comparisons have been drawn between Duke and the U.S. Army General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]<ref name="DukeTrivia">{{cite web| url=http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Edmund_Duke#Trivia| title=Trivia on Edmund Duke at the ''StarCraft'' Wiki| accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>. Duke's character first appears in the ''StarCraft'' prequel campaign ''Loomings''<ref name="ep0m4">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e0_4| title=Transcript of dialogue for ''Loomings'', mission 4 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy| accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>, defending the colony of Chau Sara, where he appears as a siege tank commander. In ''StarCraft'' and ''Brood War'', Duke is always in command of a [[Space battleships and battlecruisers|battlecruiser]].

Through the early parts of ''StarCraft'' Episode I, Duke's character represents the Confederacy, passing down orders to the player on Mar Sara and later arresting [[#Jim Raynor|Raynor]]<ref name="ep1m2">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e1_2| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode I, mission 2 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy| accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>. Mid-way through Episode I, his forces are deployed to [[Antiga Prime]] to prevent any uprisings from the populace but his forces are defeated by the [[Sons of Korhal]] and Duke's flagship, ''Norad II'', crash-lands in Zerg territory<ref name="ep1m6">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e1_6| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode I, mission 6 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy| accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>. However, Duke is rescued on the orders of [[#Arcturus Mengsk|Arcturus Mengsk]]. Mengsk convinces Duke to defect, and the general's knowledge becomes vital to the assault on [[Tarsonis]] towards the end of Episode I. After Episode I Duke only makes sporadic appearances, heading up a [[Terran Dominion]] task force to Char in Episode II<ref name="ep2m3">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e2_3| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode II, mission 3 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy| accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>, an expedition that fails its objectives and drags on into Episode III<ref name="ep3m5">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_5| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode III, mission 5 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy| accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>. In ''Brood War'' Duke's role is reduced even further, appearing to defend the Dylarian shipyards from the UED<ref name="ep5m2">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_2| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode V, mission 2 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy| accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> early in Episode V and later in Kerrigan's alliance in Episode VI. Duke is ultimately killed when Kerrigan's forces destroy his new flagship<ref name="ep6m5">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_5| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode VI, mission 5 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy| accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>, the ''Norad III'', halfway through Episode VI in order to weaken the Dominion.

General Duke is also featured in three ''StarCraft'' novels; ''[[StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade]]'' shows his movements through ''StarCraft'' Episode I<ref name="LibertyNovel">{{cite book| last= Grubb| first=Jeff|  title=StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2001}}</ref>, and he makes a brief appearance in orbit of Char in ''[[StarCraft: Queen of Blades]]''. ''Queen of Blades'' also reveals that Duke was responsible for losing Mengsk's flagship, the ''Hyperion'', to Raynor at the Dylarian shipyards<ref name="QueenNovel">{{cite book| last= Rosenburg| first= Aaron|  title=StarCraft: Queen of Blades| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2006}}</ref> just after the end of Episode I. Duke is also a main character in ''[[StarCraft: Shadow of the Xel'Naga]]'', in which Alpha Squadron is decimated by a Xel'Naga ''energy creature''<ref name="ShadowNovel">{{cite book| last= Mesta| first=Gabriel|  title=StarCraft: Shadow of the Xel'Naga| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2001}}</ref> and as a result he and his surviving forces are merged into Mengsk's Elite Guard for ''Brood War''.

===Tychus Findlay===
[[Image:Tychus Findlay (StarCraft).gif|right]]
'''Tychus J. Findlay''' is a [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terran]] [[space marine|marine]] who first appears in the ''StarCraft II'' cinematic trailer<ref name="sc2trailers">{{cite web| url=http://eu.starcraft2.com/movies.xml| title=''StarCraft II'' trailers.| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>, in which he is shown being encased into marine armour. He is also the subject of a promotional statue for ''StarCraft II''<ref name="sc2statue"/>. According to an interview with Blizzard's Nick Carpenter, Findlay is to be a prominent character in ''StarCraft II''<ref name="sc2trailerinterview">{{cite web| url=http://eu.starcraft2.com/features/interviews/cinematicteaser.xml| title=The making of the ''StarCraft II'' cinematic trailer, an interview with Nick Carpenter.| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>.

According to his criminal record within the trailer, Findlay is a convicted criminal from [[Mar Sara]], sentenced for [[murder]], [[piracy]], [[theft]], [[larceny]] and [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics]] offences, and is also suspected of several other crimes<ref name="sc2statue"/>. It is also revealed in the trailer that his death sentence was commuted for service in the Marine Corps. However, little other information about the character has been released.

===Raszagal===
[[Image:Raszagal (StarCraft).gif|right]]

'''Raszagal''' is a central Protoss character in ''StarCraft: Brood War'', taking on the role of the matriarch of the Dark Templar<ref name="BWmanual"/>. At one thousand and fourty-five years old<ref name="BWmanual"/> the female Protoss is one of the oldest Protoss observed in the ''StarCraft'' universe. During the ''Brood War'' Protoss campaign, Raszagal gives the player missions and orders whilst the focus of the storyline is on Shakuras. Debra Deliso voices the character of Raszagal in ''Brood War''<ref name="BWcasting"/>.

Raszagal first appears in the early missions of ''Brood War'', directing the player to objectives that eventually leads to the activation of the [[Xel'Naga]] temple on Shakuras. However, whilst the player's character, along with Zeratul and [[#Artanis|Artanis]] are recovering the crystals necessary to activate the temple during the course of Episode IV, the judicator [[#Aldaris|Aldaris]] learns that Kerrigan is holding mental sway over the matriarch and starts an open revolt against the Dark Templar on Shakuras. Upon Artanis' and Zeratul's return to the planet late in Episode IV, Raszagal orders the termination of Aldaris<ref name="ep4m7"/>. Aldaris is eventually killed, and despite Zeratul's growing suspicions of Raszagal<ref name="ep4m7"/>, the temple is activated in the final mission of Episode IV, annilating the Zerg on the surface<ref name="ep4m8">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e4_8| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode IV, mission 8 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>.

The matriarch does not feature in the game again until the late stages of Episode VI, when Kerrigan and [[#Samir Duran|Duran]] abduct her from a fortified outpost on Shakuras<ref name="ep6m7">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_7| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode VI, mission 7 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>. Kerrigan then uses Raszagal to persuade Zeratul to assassinate the second Zerg Overmind<ref name="ep6m8">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_8| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode VI, mission 8 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>, after which it is revealed that Raszagal had been controlled by Kerrigan since before the events of Episode IV<ref name="ep6m8"/> and that Raszagal was following Kerrigan's objectives for dominance. However, Zeratul's forces recapture Raszagal, but are unable to hold off the Zerg forces long enough to escape. Realising that Raszagal is beyond redemption from Kerrigan's influence, Zeratul kills Raszagal<ref name="ep6m9">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_9| title=Transcript of dialogue for Episode VI, mission 9 at ''StarCraft'' Legacy.| accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>.

===Nova Terra===
[[Image:Nova Terra (StarCraft).gif|right]]
'''November Annabella Terra'''<ref name="NovaNovel">{{cite book| last= DeCandido| first=Keith R. A.|  title=StarCraft Ghost: Nova| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2006}}</ref>, normally known by her nickname '''Nova''', is a ghost agent for the [[Terran Dominion]], and the protagonist of the ''[[StarCraft: Ghost]]'' sub-series. Despite the postponement of the ''Ghost'' game, her character still continues through ''[[StarCraft Ghost: Nova]]'', a novel covering Nova's early life that was meant to accompany the game's release<ref name="NovaNovelFore">{{cite book| last= DeCandido| first=Keith R. A.| chapter=Foreword | title=StarCraft Ghost: Nova| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2006}}</ref>. 

According to ''StarCraft Ghost: Nova'', Nova was the daughter of one of the highly influencial [[Terran Confederacy|Confederate]] Old Families<ref name="NovaNovel"/>, and despite having unusually high psionic potential her father was able to prevent her from being taken into the Confederate Ghost Program<ref name="NovaNovel"/>. However, after her family was murdered by an anti-Confederate resistance movement, Nova fled to the undercity of [[Tarsonis]] and was forced to work for an organised crime boss who wanted to utilise her psionic powers for his ends. During the Zerg assault on Tarsonis at the end of ''StarCraft'''s Episode I, a Confederate wrangler eventually tracked her down and was able to get her off the planet, inadvertantly ending up in the Sons of Korhal fleet<ref name="NovaNovel"/>. As a result, Nova voluntarily trained as a Dominion ghost agent and had her memory wiped to remove the reminders of her family's murder and her involvement with the Tarsonis underworld<ref name="NovaNovel"/>.

Due to the postponement of the ''StarCraft: Ghost'' game, Nova has not been featured in any mediums since. However, it has  been speculated that Nova may have a role in ''[[StarCraft II]]'' as her familiar armour discretely appears in concept art<ref name="sc2mengskart">{{cite web| url=http://eu.starcraft2.com/images/artwork/ss13-hires.jpg| title=Concept art of Arcturus Mengsk for ''StarCraft II''.| accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> depicting an elderly male Terran, presumed to be Arcturus Mengsk.

==Minor characters==
{{main|User:S@bre/Minor characters in StarCraft}}
In addition to the main characters, the ''StarCraft'' series also has a significant roster of supporting characters. These characters are usually main characters in their prospective source, for example [[Minor characters in StarCraft#Michael Daniel Liberty|Michael Liberty]] is the central character to ''[[StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade]]'' and [[Minor characters in StarCraft#Jack Frost|Jack Frost]] is a key character in ''[[StarCraft: Insurrection]]'' but neither have any major influence on the overall storyline outside these mediums. Whilst their contributions are noteworthy in expanding the universe, they can be regarded as minor characters within the entirety of the ''StarCraft'' series.

[[Image:Collectors figures (StarCraft).jpg|right|270px|thumb|The first series of the collectable statues.]]
