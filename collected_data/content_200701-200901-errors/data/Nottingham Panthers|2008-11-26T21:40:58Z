The '''Nottingham Panthers''' (officially known as the '''GMB Nottingham Panthers''' due to sponsorship by the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB union]]) are an [[ice hockey]] club based in [[Nottingham]], England. They are currently members of the [[Elite Ice Hockey League]]. The modern-day Nottingham Panthers were formed in 1980, and were named after a club of the same name that existed between 1946 and 1960. During the 2006–07 season the Panthers celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of ice hockey's arrival in the city. They play their home games at the [[National Ice Centre]] just east of [[Nottingham City Centre|Nottingham city centre]]. Until 2000 the team played at the [[Nottingham Ice Stadium|Ice Stadium]] which stood on the same site as their current home.

The Panthers are one of the most financially stable and best supported ice hockey clubs in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |title= Ice Hockey Annual 2006–07 |author= Roberts, Stewart (ed.) |publisher=  |year= 2006 |month= October |isbn= 0953641074 }}</ref> They have played at the highest level of British ice hockey throughout their history and are the only team who were founder members of the [[British Hockey League]]'s Premier Division in 1983 who continue to hold membership of the top flight league. During their history the Panthers have won three [[British ice hockey league champions|league titles]], two [[British Championship|Championships]], six [[Autumn Cup]]s and two [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]]s. The Panthers are the holders of the Challenge Cup having beaten their arch rivals [[Sheffield Steelers]] 9–7 on aggregate in the 2008 final.

==History==
===1946–60: Original era===
{{details|History of the Nottingham Panthers (1939-1960)}}

An initial attempt to bring a professional [[ice hockey]] team to [[Nottingham]] was made in 1939 following the completion of the [[Nottingham Ice Stadium|Ice Stadium]]. A team was assembled and brought to the United Kingdom from Canada to compete in the 1939–40 [[English National League]] season but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref name="footballpost">{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title =  | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] Football Post | issue = 18 | volume = LXXXVI | date = [[2006-11-18]] }}</ref> Seven years later, after the war had ended, a second effort to bring ice hockey to the city was begun. With a team of Canadians largely from [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], the Nottingham Panthers played their first competitive game on 22 November 1946 with a 3–2 home victory over the [[Wembley Monarchs]].<ref name="scrapbook">{{cite book |author = Chambers, Michael A.

[[Image:Panthers46.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The first Nottingham Panthers team]]

The Panthers struggled during their early years and only once during their first four seasons did they finish in the upper half of the league table.<ref name="chambers">{{cite book |title= Nottingham Panthers Statistical Guidebook 1946–2000 |author= Chambers, Michael A. (ed.) |publisher=  |year= 2000 |month= November |isbn= 0953939804 }}</ref> The club's first coach, [[Alex Archer]], left Nottingham after two seasons and was replaced by [[Archibald Stinchcombe|Archie Stinchcombe]] who would coach the team until 1955. Despite a lack of success in their formative years the team had a number of players who would become local heroes including [[forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] [[Les Strongman]] and [[Chick Zamick]]. Zamick became one of the most prolific scorers in the league and won the ''Nottingham Sportsman of the Year'' award on two occasions, defeating sportsmen such as the [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[England national football team|England]] international [[football (soccer)|footballer]] [[Tommy Lawton]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Players/zamick.htm | title=Victor "Chick" Zamick | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2006-11-30 }}</ref>

The club's first major title came in the 1950–51 season. After finishing fourth in the Autumn Cup the Panthers won 18 of their 30 league games and clinched the league championship. The team also ended the campaign having scored the most goals and conceded the least.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/50-51.htm | title=1950/51 | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2006-11-30 }}</ref> The following season Nottingham lost Chick Zamick to injury and fell to the bottom of the rankings. Success returned in 1953–54 when, after a last place finish in the Autumn Cup, the Panthers secured their second English League title by one point over [[Streatham Redskins|Streatham]].<ref name="chambers"/>

In the close season of 1954 the English League and the [[Scottish National League (1932 - 1954)|Scottish League]] were merged to form a [[British National League (1954 - 1960)|British League]]. The Panthers finished second to the [[Harringay Racers]] in the eleven team competition. After one season all the Scottish teams, with the exception of the [[Paisley Pirates]], withdrew from the British League and left it with only five members.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ihjuk.co.uk/history.htm | title=Ice Hockey History | work=Ice Hockey Journalists UK | accessdate=2008-01-11 }}</ref> The close season of 1955 also saw the departure of Stinchcombe who was replaced as coach by Zamick. The 1955–56 season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Nottingham won the Autumn Cup at the beginning of the season before clinching their third league title on [[goal average]] ahead of the [[Wembley Lions]].<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | title = Panthers Gain League Title By 7–6 Win Over Racers | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1956-05-07]] }}</ref> They also traveled to [[Sweden]] where they won the [[Ahearne Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.azhockey.com/Ah.htm#Ahearne%20Cup | title=Ah – Ahearne Cup | work=A to Z Encyclopedia of Ice Hockey | accessdate=2008-01-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.azhockey.com/champs/champsOthers.html#Ahearne%20Cup | title=Championship & League Winners – Other Competitions – Ahearne Cup | work=A to Z Encyclopedia of Ice Hockey | accessdate=2008-01-05 }}</ref> This was the last occasion that the original club would win silverware and is, to date, the last season in which a Nottingham Panthers team were [[British ice hockey league champions|league champions]].

Over the next four years Nottingham alternated between bottom and second place in the league standings.<ref name="chambers"/> After finishing runner-up in 1959–60, the Panthers took part in the first [[British Championship]] final in thirty years where they faced the [[Brighton Tigers]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.azhockey.com/champs/champsGB.html#British%20Championship | title=League & Championship Winners – Great Britain – British Championship | work=A to Z Encyclopedia of Ice Hockey | accessdate=2006-11-30 }}</ref> Nottingham were defeated 3–2 in the first leg but won the second in regulation time by the same scoreline forcing [[overtime (sports)|overtime]]. The Tigers clinched the tie 6–5 after six minutes and 32 seconds of the extra session.<ref>{{Citation | last = Simpkin | first = Lawrie | title = Brighton draw in extra time to gain title | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1960-05-07]] }}</ref> During the close season of 1960 the British National League collapsed and the Nottingham Panthers were disbanded. Ice hockey would not return to Nottingham for the next two decades.

===1980–Present: Modern era===
====Ice Stadium years====

The Nottingham Panthers were revived largely thanks to the efforts of Gary Keward.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Players/kewardg.htm | title=Gary Keward | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2007-02-06 }}</ref> In 1980 the Ice Stadium directors, led by Charles Walker, agreed to a request by Keward to give ice hockey another chance. The [[Sheffield Lancers]], a team Keward helped to run, were relocated to Nottingham taking the name of the team that had occupied the same building 20 years earlier. On 20 September 1980 the modern Panthers took to the ice for the first time defeating the [[Solihull Barons]] 7–4 at the Ice Stadium.<ref name="scrapbook"/>

[[Image:Kewardg.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gary Keward, the man who brought the Panthers back to Nottingham]]

During their first three seasons the Panthers played in regional leagues, first in the [[English League South]] and then in Section B of the [[British Hockey League]]. In 1983 the British Hockey League reconstituted itself into the first truly national ice hockey league for 23 years and Nottingham became one of nine founder members of the league's Premier Division. The Panthers were one of the best supported teams in the league with games regularly selling out<ref name="footballpost"/> but success on the ice eluded them as the team struggled against more established opponents such as the [[Durham Wasps]] and the [[Murrayfield Racers]]. It was not until the appointment of [[Alex Dampier]] as coach in 1985 that the team's fortunes began to change. In his first season Dampier led Nottingham to the playoffs for the first time since reforming. The Panthers lost all four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the finals at [[Wembley Arena]].<ref name="chambers"/>

In 1986 Nottingham secured their first trophy since reforming and their first overall in thirty years when they defeated the [[Fife Flyers]] 5–4 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] to win the [[Autumn Cup|Norwich Union Trophy]] at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC]] in [[Birmingham]] in front of a crowd of {{formatnum:5600}}.<ref name="chambers"/> Layton Eratt scored the winning goal after one minute and 53 seconds of the extra session in a game that had seen both the Panthers and the Flyers lead twice.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = Now for the top four | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1986-11-17]] }}</ref> In the league Nottingham again succeeded in qualifying for the playoffs but again failed to register a point. The team repeated this in the [[British Championship|Championships]] the following season bringing the number of consecutive playoff defeats to twelve.

In 1988–89 the Panthers enjoyed one of their most successful seasons. They finished third in the league and were not only able to register their first win in the playoffs but also advance to the finals at Wembley for the first time. Nottingham met [[Whitley Warriors]] in the semi final, winning the match 8–6. In the final the following day the Panthers defeated the [[Ayr Bruins]] 6–3, clinching their first [[British Championship|Championship]] title.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = Champagne Panthers | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1989-04-24]] }}</ref> Another Autumn Cup followed in 1991 but Dampier left the club during the 1992–93 season to join the newly formed [[Sheffield Steelers]]. He was replaced by Kevin Murphy who coached the team for the remainder of the campaign. Murphy was in turn replaced by [[Mike Blaisdell]] during the close season of 1993. 

Blaisdell assembled a strong team for the 1994–95 season and led the Panthers to the [[Autumn Cup|Benson & Hedges Cup]] with a 7–2 victory over the [[Cardiff Devils]] in the final. Nottingham opened their league campaign with a 21 game unbeaten run<ref name="scrapbook"/> but four defeats over the final two weekends of the regular season, including an 8–6 home defeat to nearest rivals and eventual champions Sheffield, denied the club their first league championship in 39 years.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = Nightmare end to season of promise | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1995-03-26]] }}</ref> During the 1995–96 season the Panthers made it to both the Benson & Hedges Cup and playoff finals, but they were defeated on each occasion by the Steelers.

In 1996 the Panthers became a founder member of the new [[Ice Hockey Superleague]]. The new league abolished the [[Salary cap|wage cap]] and restrictions on the number of non-British trained players a club was allowed. Many of Nottingham's British players, who had risen through the ranks of the club's youth development system, were dropped in favour of North American imports. Of Nottingham's locally trained contingent only [[Randall Weber]], Ashley Tait and Simon Hunt were retained.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/96-97.htm#Player%20Stats | title=1996/97 – Player Stats | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2006-12-04 }}</ref> The club acquired Trevor Robins, the club's first import [[goaltender]] since reforming, and [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] Marty Dallman, Greg Hadden, [[Derek Laxdal]] and Darryl Olsen. The Panthers began the season by qualifying for the Benson & Hedges Cup final for a third straight year following a 6–3 aggregate victory over arch rivals Sheffield at the semi final stage.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = Panthers storm to the final | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1996-11-01]] }}</ref> In the final they defeated the [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] 5–3, taking the lead 29 seconds into the game and never relinquishing it.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = That'll do ice-ly | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1996-12-09]] }}</ref> The Panthers finished fourth in the league and qualified for the last four in the playoffs after finishing top of their group with five wins and one overtime loss from six games.<ref name="chambers"/> Their semi final against the Ayr Scottish Eagles became the longest game in British ice hockey history.<ref name="chambers"/> The scores were level at 5–5 after regulation time and each of the following five periods of ten minute overtime ended goalless. Only in the sixth period of overtime, with the two hour mark of the match nearing, did Jeff Hoad finally score a shorthanded winner for Nottingham ending the game after 115 minutes and 49 seconds.<ref>{{Citation | last = Lowe | first = Andy | title = Panthers win the late, late show! | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1997-03-24]] }}</ref> In the final the Panthers met Sheffield where they were defeated 3–1 after taking an early lead.

In 1997 the Panthers [[sports franchising|franchise]] was sold after directors revealed the club was in considerable debt. A buyer was found in [[London]] based businessman Neil Black and his sports management company.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/97-98.htm | title=1997/98 | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> The 1998–99 season saw the Panthers sign one of their strongest ever line-ups. After finishing third in their Benson & Hedges Cup group, the Panthers eliminated the [[Slough Jets]] and [[Newcastle Jesters|Newcastle Riverkings]] before defeating the [[Manchester Storm]] in the semi final despite being depleted by injuries and facing a full strength Storm side.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = Now bring on the Ayr in final | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1998-11-13]] }}</ref> The final saw the Panthers taking on the [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] in a repeat of the 1996 final.

Nottingham also qualified for the finals of the [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]] and the playoffs but the team were defeated in each. In the first, they lost 4–0 to Sheffield in the Challenge Cup despite [[Shot on goal|outshooting]] their opponents 39–24. Teeder Wynne and John Wynne put Sheffield 2-0 up inside 4 minutes, Ed Courtenay scored the 3rd and an empty net goal by Ken Priestlay late on completed the scoring. Two weeks later, they lost 2–1 to Cardiff in the Championship final despite outshooting the Devils 36–24.<ref name="chambers"/> During the course of the season [[Paul Adey]] and Greg Hadden scored 141 [[Point (ice hockey)|points]] between them, four players scored more than 20 [[Goal (ice hockey)|goals]], six players earned more than 30 [[Assist (ice hockey)|assists]] and seven players achieved 30 or more points.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/98-99.htm#PLAYER%A0STATS | title=1998/99 – Player Stats | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2008-01-03 }}</ref>

[[Image:98b&hcup.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Panthers celebrate their 1998 Benson & Hedges Cup victory]]
The 1999–00 season was the club's final year at the Ice Stadium before moving to the [[National Ice Centre]]. The budget for players was limited by the club chairman so that the Panthers would be able to break even the following season.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = The Puck Stops Here | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1999-06-28]] }}</ref> Players were asked to take a wage cut, leading to the departure of Trevor Robins, Mike Bishop, [[Mark Kolesar]], Eric Dubios and record goalscorer [[Paul Adey]].<ref name="blaisdell">{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = No pain, no gain | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1999-06-28]] }}</ref> This frustrated Mike Blaisdell<ref name="blaisdell"/> who left the club in November to become head coach of the Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by former coach [[Alex Dampier]]. Lacking the spending power of many of their rivals, Nottingham finished sixth in the eight team league. The club fared better in the Challenge Cup where it made the final for the second successive year but the team was defeated 2–1 at [[London Arena]] by Mike Blaisdell's Steelers. This game ended in controversy. With 3 seconds remaining the celebratory fireworks went off and ticker tape covered the ice. The play had been whistled dead because of an icing call that had gone un-noticed by the majority of the crowd. The officials decided against clearing the ice with the zamboni and ended the game prematurely. On 22 March 2000 the Panthers hosted Newcastle in their final game at the Ice Stadium. [[Jamie Leach]] scored Nottingham's last goal at their home of 54 years but the club was defeated 2–1 in overtime.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = And that's all folks... | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[2000-03-23]] }}</ref>

====Move to the National Ice Centre====

The Panthers moved to the new [[National Ice Centre]] in September 2000. The new building held more than double the capacity of their old rink and [[sports attendance|attendance]] levels increased by 72 percent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2000-01.htm#summary | title=2000/01 – Summary | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2007-02-10 }}</ref> The team endured a terrible first season in their new home. They were [[single-elimination tournament|knocked out]] at the semi final stage of the [[Autumn Cup|Benson & Hedges Cup]] by the [[Sheffield Steelers|Steelers]] and suffered a dire first half to the regular season. By [[Christmas]] the team faced the prospect of not qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 1985. Form improved during the second half of the season with the team winning five of their first seven home games during 2001, including a 6–4 victory over the Sheffield Steelers marred by a violent bench clearing brawl.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | title=Brawl taints Panthers' victory | work=BBC Sport | date=2001-02-10 | accessdate=2006-12-29 }}</ref> The Panthers still lay in ninth and last place going into their final game of the regular season, three points behind their opponents [[Newcastle Jesters]]. Nottingham required a regulation time win to claim the eighth and final playoff berth, something they had not done away from their home ice all season. The Jesters needed only to tie.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1200926.stm | title=Jesters set up decider | work=BBC Sport | date=2001-03-04 | accessdate=2008-01-10 }}</ref> With 10.1 seconds to go, the game was locked at 2–2, but with an [[extra attacker]] the Panthers won a [[faceoff]] next to the Newcastle goal and [[Robert Nordmark]] scored with 4.4 seconds remaining to take them into the playoffs and eliminate the Jesters.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1202464.stm | title=Panthers progress in dramatic finale | work=BBC Sport | date=2001-03-05 | accessdate=2006-12-29 }}</ref> In the playoffs a 5–0 win over a financially troubled Sheffield Steelers<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/1219296.stm | title=Steelers mauled by Panthers | work=BBC Sport | date=2001-03-14 | accessdate=2007-02-06 }}</ref> was their only victory of the post season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2000-01.htm#PLAY%20OFFS | title=2000/01 – Play offs | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2007-02-06 }}</ref>

[[Image:National Ice Centre - Trent FM Arena.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National Ice Centre]] 

The following season numerous changes were made to the playing staff and record goalscorer Paul Adey returned to the club as coach. Nottingham would eventually finish in fourth place in a league now reduced to seven members, two points off the second place [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] but 23 points behind champions [[Belfast Giants]]. The Panthers qualified for the semi finals of the Challenge Cup but were eliminated 7–4 on aggregate by Ayr. In the playoffs they won one game in the preliminary stages and finished sixth overall, failing to qualify for the last four for a second successive year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2001-02.htm | title=2001/02 | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2008-01-06 }}</ref>

In 2003 the [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] collapsed after financial problems; it was left with only five members<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2477323.stm | title=Eagles forced out | work=BBC Sport | date=2002-11-14 | accessdate=2007-07-02 }}</ref> and faced the prospect of having only three.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2535681.stm | title=Bees to quit Superleague | work=BBC Sport | date=2002-12-02 | accessdate=2006-12-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.londonknights.co.uk/archives/news_archive_knights_future.htm | title=The Knights' Future | work=London Knights | date=2003-04-29 | accessdate=2006-12-31 }}</ref> The Panthers finished the league season in third place; lost 3–2 in the [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]] final to the Steelers and were eliminated 4–3 in the semi finals of the playoffs by the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]], who scored the game winning goal with just 0.2 seconds remaining.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2920999.stm | title=Giants to face Knights | work=BBC Sport | date=2003-04-05 | accessdate=2007-07-02 }}</ref>

After a close season which saw uncertainty over which league the Panthers would be taking part in<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sportfocus.com/newspub/story.cfm?id=2530 | title=Governing Body Decline to Affiliate Elite League | work=Sport Focus | date=2003-05-30 | accessdate=2006-06-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2952464.stm | title=Elite League "will go ahead" | work=BBC Sport | date=2003-05-31 | accessdate=2006-07-02 }}</ref> and even uncertainty over the future of the club itself,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2003-04.htm | title=2003/04 | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2006-12-29 }}</ref> Nottingham became a founding member of the new [[Elite Ice Hockey League]]. Changes to regulations regarding the number of non-[[United Kingdom|British]] trained players and a lower [[Salary cap|wage cap]] necessitated numerous changes to the squad and in came a number of British players including [[forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] [[David Clarke (ice hockey)|David Clarke]] and Marc Levers and several new imports, including [[Finland|Finns]] Kim Ahlroos and Mikko Koivunoro and Canadian [[John Craighead]].  The new team started strongly and by the end of the year Nottingham were at the top of the table.  However they struggled against their archrivals Sheffield Steelers who were able to overtake the team after a string of wins over the Panthers, before establishing a commanding lead at the top of the table.  Eventually Nottingham finished in second place, their highest league finish in twelve years.  The team also qualified for the Challenge Cup final after an 11–5 aggregate victory over the [[Belfast Giants|Giants]] in the semi final.  Their opponent in the two-legged final was again the Steelers, a team that Nottingham had failed to beat in each of the six finals the two club's had contested.  The first leg ended in a 1–1 tie in [[Nottingham]], with David Clarke scoring for the home side.  In the second leg at [[Sheffield Arena]] the Panthers raced to an early 3–1 aggregate lead however Sheffield pulled a goal back late in the second period and equalised with ten minutes remaining, forcing overtime.  After 53 seconds of the extra session Kim Ahlroos scored the winning goal, ending an eight year wait for the Panthers to beat the Steelers in a showpiece final and securing the club's first silverware since 1998.<ref>{{Citation | last = Holland | first = Mick | title = Panthers bring an end to final hurt | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[2004-03-18]] }}</ref> The Panthers followed up their trophy win with a strong playoff campaign, but after a 6–1 win over the [[Manchester Phoenix]] in the semi final, the Steelers avenged their Challenge Cup defeat with a narrow 2–1 win in the final.

[[Image:Final07.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Nottingham and Cardiff line up prior to the 2007 playoff final]]

The 2004–05 season saw the club take part in the [[Continental Cup]]. The Panthers were placed into a group with host team Gothiques d'Amiens, Italian side [[HC Milano Vipers|Milano Vipers]] and [[Slovenia]]n side [[Olimpija Ljubljana]]. Nottingham tied their first game against Milan before recording 1–0 and 3–1 victories over the Slovenians and French, narrowly missing out on a place in the second round of the competition due to Milan's better goal difference.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2004-05.htm#CONTINENTAL | title=2004/05 – Continental Cup | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2006-12-31 }}</ref> Domestically the team struggled for much of season and only during the end of season playoffs did the Panthers replicate the form they showed in Europe where, despite being depleted by injuries, they qualified for the a second successive playoff final, losing 2–1 in overtime to eventual [[Wiktionary:grand slam|Grand Slam]] winners [[Coventry Blaze]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2004-05.htm#PLAY%20OFFS | title=2004/05 – Play Offs | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2006-12-31 }}</ref>

In the summer of 2005, Paul Adey left his position as coach and was replaced by former coach [[Mike Blaisdell]].

Another coaching change came during the summer of 2006 when Mike Ellis joined the club having guided the [[Bracknell Bees]] to a number of titles in the [[British National League]] and [[English Premier Ice Hockey League|English Premier League]]. Ellis made numerous changes to the playing staff and led the Panthers to a fifth place league finish.

==Name origins, logos and colours==

[[Image:Panthers94.gif|right|thumb|200px|The second Panthers logo 1994–98]]

The origin of the name Panthers is uncertain. One of the most widely known theories is that the club were named for a squadron of Canadian airmen based near [[Nottingham]] during [[World War II]]. However, there is no evidence to suggest that such a squadron existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.panthers.co.uk/SEFS/ID.29/SEFE/ViewItem.asp | title=The History of the Nottingham Panthers - Part 2 | work=panthers.co.uk | accessdate=2007-11-30 }}</ref> A souvenir brochure produced to mark of the opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue's new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers.<ref name=footballpost/> It does not, however, explain the rationale behind the name.<ref>Nottingham Ice Rink Grand Opening Souvenir Brochure, 10 April 1939</ref> Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939–40 before the name was revived in 1946.

During the original era the Panthers did not have a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed.<ref name="scrapbook"/> The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the silhouette of a Panthers' head in a red circle.<ref name="82season">{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/82.htm | title=1982/83 Nottingham Panthers| work=Panthers History | accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref> The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the [[National Ice Centre]] and was similar to the logo of German side [[Augsburger Panther]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hockeyarenas.net/index.php3?page=4000&lcID=de&tmID=66 | title=Augsburger Panther | work=hockeyarenas.net | accessdate=2007-12-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2000-01.htm | title=2000/01 | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2007-12-07 }}</ref> The stylised lettering used during the original era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.

The colours used by the original Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black with a black and white striped lining on the shoulders.<ref name="scrapbook"/> When the club reformed in 1980, the black and white colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys.<ref name="82season"/> In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of the shirts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/96.htm | title=1996/97 Nottingham Panthers | work=Panthers History | accessdate=2007-12-07 }}</ref> In 2001–02 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold with a black lining with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007–08, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]].

==Stadiums==
{{details3|[[Nottingham Ice Stadium]] and [[National Ice Centre]]}}

The original home of the Panthers was the [[Nottingham Ice Stadium|Ice Stadium]]. Built by Sims, Sons and Cooke Ltd,<ref name="homes">{{cite book |author = Harris, Martin C. |title= Homes of British Ice Hockey |publisher= NPI Media Group  |date= [[2005-10-01]] |isbn= 0752425811}}</ref> the Ice Stadium was based on the [[Harringay Arena]]<ref name="chambers"/> and officially opened on 10 April 1939. The building hosted its first game two days later with the [[Harringay Greyhounds]] defeating the [[Harringay Racers]] 10–6 in a challenge game in front of a crowd of {{formatnum:5000}} spectators.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | title = Ice Hockey Thrills Crowd of 5,000 at Nottingham Match – Harringay Teams in Oppostition | newspaper = [[Nottingham Evening Post]] | date = [[1939-04-13]] }}</ref> Though a team playing under the name Nottingham Panthers would play three games during the winter of 1939–40, it would be 1946 before the venue would host a competitive match. During [[World War II]] the Ice Stadium served as a makeshift munitions store and morgue.<ref name="footballpost"/> The building reopened on 31 August 1946 and hosted another game between the Greyhounds and Racers before the Panthers made their competitive debut on 22 November, defeating the [[Wembley Monarchs]] 3–2. The venue became the home of the team between 1946 and 1960 and again from the club's reformation in 1980 to 2000.

The Ice Stadium held a capacity of {{formatnum:2950}} spectators and had an ice pad measuring {{convert|185|ft|m}} by {{convert|85|ft|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.azhockey.com/No.htm#Nottingham%20Ice%20Stadium | title=No – Nottingham Ice Stadium | work=A to Z Encyclopedia of Ice Hockey | accessdate=2007-06-15 }}</ref> After the club's reformation a second ice pad was installed in 1983.<ref name="homes"/> In October 1996 plans were announced by Nottingham City Council to replace the ageing building with a twin-rinked [[National Ice Centre]].<ref name="ncc">{{cite web | url=http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/sitemap/cd_reg_int-ice_centre-2 | title=National Ice Centre | work=Nottingham City Council | accessdate=2007-06-15 }}</ref> Work began on the {{formatnum:6500}} capacity arena section of the facility in the summer of 1998 and was completed in the spring of 2000. The Panthers played their final game at the Ice Stadium on 22 March 2000. After the game supporters were allowed to dismantle anything easily removable from the interior of the building to take home as souvenirs.<ref name="homes"/> The Ice Stadium was demolished soon afterwards to allow for the completion of the new Ice Centre.<ref name="ncc"/>

The new National Ice Centre was designed by Nottingham City Council officials and was built by [[John Laing|John Laing plc]]. The building cost £40 million to construct, of which £22.5 million was awarded by the [[National Lottery]].<ref name="ncc"/> The arena half of the facility was opened on 1 April 2000, with the second public skating pad opening a year later. Both rinks are [[Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics|Olympic sized]] ice pads measuring {{convert|196|ft|m}} by {{convert|97|ft|m}}.<ref name="homes"/> The Panthers played their first game at their new home on 2 September 2000 when the team hosted the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]] in the [[Autumn Cup|Benson & Hedges Cup]]. [[Barry Nieckar]] scored the club's first goal in a 2–1 Panthers victory played to a crowd of {{formatnum:4800}}.<ref name="homes"/>
