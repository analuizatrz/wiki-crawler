The '''Republic of South Africa''' (also known by [[Official names of South Africa|other official names]]) is a country located at the southern tip of Africa.

Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klasies_River_Caves|title=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klasies_River_Caves}}</ref> With the discovery of the [[History of Cape Colony|Cape Sea Route]], the [[Dutch East India Company]] founded a refreshment station at what would become [[Cape Town]] in 1652.<ref name="wcupa-courses">{{cite web|url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/jones/his311/timeline/t-19saf.htm |title= African History Timeline|publisher= West Chester University of Pennsylvania }}</ref> Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the [[Boers]] (original [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish]], [[German people|German]] and [[French people|French]] settlers) and the British [[1820 Settlers]] claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose between the original inhabitants of the land, the Xhosa and Zulu, and the new European settlers. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the [[Anglo-Boer War]] as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a [[republic]]. The leading [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized [[Racial segregation|segregation]] known as ''[[apartheid]]''), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president [[F.W. de Klerk]] began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought [[Nelson Mandela]] and the current ruling party, the [[African National Congress]] to power.

South Africa is known for its diversity, and eleven official languages are recognised in its [[Constitution of South Africa|constitution]].<ref name=safacts/> English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language.<ref name=safacts/> South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest [[Whites in South Africa|Caucasian]], [[Asians in South Africa|Indian]], and [[Coloured|racially mixed]] communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is [[Black people|Black]],<ref name="statssa-midyear2007"/> this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as they speak a number of different [[Bantu languages]], nine of which have official status.<ref name=safacts/> Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9&nbsp;million.<ref name="statssa-midyear2007"/>

==History==
{{main|History of South Africa}} {{SouthAfrica state}}{{Refimprovesect|date=September 2008}}
===Pre history===
South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in Africa.<ref name="About Sterkfontein Caves">{{cite web |url=http://www.maropeng.co.za/index.php/sterkfontein/ |title=About Sterkfontein Caves }}</ref> Extensive fossil remains at the [[Sterkfontein]], [[Kromdraai, Gauteng|Kromdraai]] and Makapansgat caves suggest that various [[australopithecus|australopithecines]] existed in South Africa from about three million years ago.<ref name="">{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1979/6/79.06.02.x.html |title=Hominid Evolution |publisher=Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute |author=Stephen P. Broker |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> These were succeeded by various species of ''Homo'', including ''[[Homo habilis]]'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and modern humans, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Settlements of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples, who were [[iron]]-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the [[Limpopo River]] by the fourth or fifth century (see [[Bantu expansion]]) displacing and absorbing the original [[Khoisan|KhoiSan]] speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu-Natal Province]] are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the [[Xhosa]] people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the [[Great Fish River|Fish River]], in today's [[Eastern Cape|Eastern Cape Province]]. These [[Iron Age]] populations displaced earlier people, who often had [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, as they migrated.

===European colonisation===
[[Image:Charles Bell - Jan van Riebeeck se aankoms aan die Kaap.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Painting of an account of the arrival of [[Jan van Riebeeck]], the first European to settle in South Africa, with [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] in the background]]
In 1487, the Portuguese explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] became the first European to reach the southernmost tip of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal, [[John II of Portugal|John II]], renamed it the ''Cabo da Boa Esperança'' or [[Cape of Good Hope]] as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in [[Camoens]]' epic Portuguese poem, [[The Lusiads]] (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] by [[Jan van Riebeeck]] on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. [[slavery|Slaves]] were brought from [[Indonesia]], [[Madagascar]], and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in [[Cape Town]]. As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding [[Xhosa]] people in the region of the [[Great Fish River|Fish River]]. A series of wars, called the [[Xhosa Wars|Cape Frontier Wars]], ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.[[Image:Flag of the Dutch East Indies Company.svg|thumb|Flag of the Dutch East Indies Company (Amsterdam Logo)]]

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] took over the [[Cape of Good Hope]] area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use [[Cape Town]] in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the [[Dutch East India Company]] declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging [[1820 Settlers|British settlement]]. Due to pressure of [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] societies in Britain, the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British parliament]] first stopped its global [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in 1807, then abolished slavery in all its colonies in 1833. During the 1830s, approximately 12 000 [[Boers]] (later known as [[Voortrekkers]]), departed from the [[Cape Colony]], where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the [[Boer Republics]] - the [[South African Republic]] (Now [[Gauteng]], [[Limpopo]], [[Mpumalanga]] and [[North West Province|North West]] provinces) and the [[Orange Free State]] ([[Free State]]).

The discovery of [[diamond]]s in [[1867]] and [[gold]] in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. The [[Boer Republics]] successfully resisted British encroachments during the [[First Boer War]] (1880&ndash;1881) using [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers without their red jackets in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899&ndash;1902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with [[German South-West Africa]] provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [[Image:Boers 1881.gif|thumb|Boers in combat (1881).]]

===Independence===
After four years of negotiating, the [[Union of South Africa]] was created from the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] colonies, as well as the republics of [[Orange Free State]] and [[Transvaal]], on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly-created Union of South Africa was a [[dominion]]. The [[Natives' Land Act]] of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally.<ref name="Natives' Land Act">"[http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1913-06-19.htm 19 June 1913 Native Land Act]", ''This day in history'', publish date unknown (accessed 20 December 2007).</ref> The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which morphed the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British king's]] position within South Africa into that of the distinct [[King of South Africa]]. In 1934, the [[South African Party (Union of South Africa)|South African Party]] and [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] merged to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking "Whites", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into [[World War II]] as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.

In 1948, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]]. Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest [[standard of living]] in all of Africa, often comparable to [[First World]] western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only [[referendum]], the country became a [[republic]] and left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The office of [[Governor-General]] was abolished and replaced with the position of [[State President]].
[[Image:Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|thumb|the South African national flag, 1928-1994]]
Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread [[International sanctions|sanctions]] and [[divestment]] abroad and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era]].) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance, [[Strike action|strikes]], marches, protests, and [[sabotage]] by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of [[nuclear weapon]]s, and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed that [[B.J. Vorster|Vorster]] and [[Pieter Willem Botha|P.W. Botha]] wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the [[Cuba]]n-supported [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]] government of [[Angola]].

===Democracy===
In 1990 the [[National Party]] government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the [[African National Congress]] and other [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political organisations, and released [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a [[sabotage]] sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. The first [[South African general election, 1994|multi-racial elections]] were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.

In [[post-apartheid South Africa]], millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in [[poverty]], though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly.<ref>http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-04-18-zuma-surprised-at-level-of-white-poverty</ref> While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]] of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_ZAF.html|title=South Africa|year=2006|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|work=Human Development Report|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref> Much of this could be attributed to the [[AIDS]] [[pandemic]] and the failure of the government to take steps to address it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://0-www.sairr.org.za.innopac.up.ac.za:80/wsc/pstory.htx?storyID=428|title=Ridicule succeeds where leadership failed on AIDS|publisher=South African Institute of Race Relations|date=10 November 2006}}</ref> As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of South Africa|Government of South Africa|Law of South Africa}}
[[Image:Uniegebou.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Union Buildings]] in [[Pretoria]] is the home of the South African executive.]]
<!-- Please, the city's name is Pretoria, not Tshwane. Tshwane is the municipality which Pretoria is in. The administrative division is situated in Pretoria. Do not change this. -->
South Africa is the only country with three capital cities{{Fact|date=April 2008}}: [[Cape Town]], the largest of the three, is the ''legislative'' capital; [[Pretoria]] is the ''administrative'' capital; and [[Bloemfontein]] is the ''judicial'' capital. South Africa has a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]]: the [[National Council of Provinces]] (the [[upper house]]) has 90 members, while the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by [[proportional representation]]: half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the [[President of South Africa|President]].

The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and [[British colonialism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.llrx.com/features/southafrica.htm |title=Researching South African Law |accessdate=2008-06-23 |author=Pamela Snyman and Amanda Barratt |date=2002-10-02 |publisher=[http://www.llrx.comLaw Library Resource Xchange]}}</ref> The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the [[Dutch East India Company]] and is called [[Roman-Dutch law]]. It was imported before the [[codification]] of European law into the [[Napoleonic Code]] and is comparable in many ways to [[Scots law]]. This was followed in the 19th century by [[English law]], both [[Common law|common]] and [[Statutory law|statutory]]. Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own [[parliament]] which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.

Current South African politics are dominated by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last [[South African general election, 2004|2004 general election]] and 66.3% of the vote in the [[South African municipal election, 2006|2006 municipal election]]. The current [[President of South Africa]] is [[Kgalema Motlanthe]], who replaced [[Thabo Mbeki]] on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.

The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election. [[Helen Zille]], (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was [[Tony Leon]]. The formerly dominant [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]], which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], which mainly represents [[Zulu]] voters, and the [[Independent Democrats (South Africa)|Independent Democrats]], who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.

Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the "most protest-rich country in the world".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/1898|title=Article by Imran Buccus in the Mercury newspaper}}</ref> Many of these protests have been organised from the growing [[shanty town]]s that surround South African cities.

==Foreign relations and military==
{{main|South African National Defence Force|Foreign relations of South Africa|South Africa and weapons of mass destruction}}
Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) and the [[African Union]]. South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in [[Burundi]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the [[Comoros]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As the [[Union of South Africa]], South Africa was a founding member of the [[United Nations]] and the then Prime Minister [[Jan Smuts]] wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the [[Myanmar|Burmese]] government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against [[Zimbabwe]] in 2008. South Africa is a member of the [[Group of 77]] and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the [[South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone]], [[Southern African Customs Union]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[G20 industrial nations|G20]] and [[G8+5]].

When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent [[Bantustan]]s into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ([[Cape Province]], [[Natal Province|Natal]], [[Orange Free State]], and [[Transvaal]]) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.

The nine provinces are further subdivided into [[Districts of South Africa|52 districts]]: [[Metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|6 metropolitan]] and [[District municipality (South Africa)|46 district municipalities]]. The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into [[Local municipality (South Africa)|231 local municipalities]]. The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities. The new provinces are:

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of South Africa}}
[[Image:Sf-map.png|thumb|250px|Map of South Africa]]

South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long [[coastline]] that stretches more than 2,500&nbsp;kilometres (1,550&nbsp;mi) and across two [[ocean]]s (the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]]). At 470,979&nbsp;[[square miles|sq&nbsp;mi]] (1,219,912&nbsp;km²),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|title=World Factbook|publisher=CIA}}</ref> South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after [[Mali]]). It is comparable in size to [[Colombia]]. [[Njesuthi]] in the [[Drakensberg]] at 3,408&nbsp;m (11,424&nbsp;ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.

South Africa has a generally [[temperate climate]], due in part to it being surrounded by the [[Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder [[southern hemisphere]] and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the [[equator]]) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.

The climatic zones vary, from the extreme [[desert]] of the southern [[Namib]] in the farthest northwest to the lush [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate in the east along the [[Mozambique]] border and the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a [[mountain range|mountainous]] [[escarpment]] towards the interior [[plateau]] known as the [[Highveld]]. Even though South Africa is classified as [[semi-arid]], there is considerable variation in [[climate]] as well as [[topography]].

The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated [[scrubland]], [[Karoo]], which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the [[Mediterranean]] with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous [[Fynbos]] [[Biome]]. This area also produces much of the [[wine]] in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many [[shipwreck]]s. Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the [[Garden Route]].
[[Image:South Africa sat.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite picture of South Africa|250px]]

The [[Free State]] is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the [[Vaal River]], the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. [[Johannesburg]], in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740&nbsp;metres (5,709&nbsp;ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760&nbsp;millimetres (30&nbsp;[[inch|in]]). Winters in this region are cold, although [[snow]] is rare.

To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.

The high [[Drakensberg|Drakensberg mountains]], which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited [[ski]]ing opportunities in winter.The coldest place in South Africa is [[Sutherland, South Africa|Sutherland]] in the western [[Roggeveld Mountains]], where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as −15 degrees [[Celsius]] (5&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7&nbsp;°C (125&nbsp;°F) was recorded in 1948 in the [[Northern Cape]] Kalahari near [[Upington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/geography/geography.htm|title=SouthAfrica.info: South Africa's geography}}</ref>

South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the [[Prince Edward Islands]], consisting of [[Marion Island]] (290&nbsp;km²/112&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and Prince Edward Island (45&nbsp;km²/17.3&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) (not to be confused with the [[Prince Edward Island|Canadian province of the same name]]).

===Flora and fauna===
{{seealso|Protected areas of South Africa}}
[[Image:Fynbos.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fynbos]], a [[floristic province|floral kingdom]] unique to South Africa, is found near [[Cape Town]]]]
South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered [[Megadiverse countries|Megadiverse]]. It has more than 20,000 different [[plant]]s, or about 10% of all the known [[species]] of plants on [[Earth]], making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the third most biodiverse country{{Fact|date=August 2007}}, after [[Brazil]] and [[Indonesia]], and has greater biodiversity than any country of equal or smaller size (Brazil being roughly seven times the size of South Africa, and Indonesia more than 50% larger).

The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the [[grassland]], particularly on the [[Highveld]], where the plant cover is dominated by different [[Poaceae|grasses]], low [[shrub]]s, and [[acacia tree]]s, mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn. [[Vegetation]] becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]]. There are several species of water-storing [[succulent]]s like [[aloe]]s and euphorbias in the very hot and dry [[Namaqualand]] area. The grass and thorn [[savannah]] turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with more dense growth. There are significant numbers of [[baobab]] trees in this area, near the northern end of [[Kruger National Park]].<ref>[http://www.southafrica-travel.net/pages/e_plants.htm Plants and Vegetation in South Africa], South Africa Online Travel Guide.</ref>

The [[Fynbos]] [[Biome]], which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the [[Cape floristic region]], one of the six [[floristic province|floral kingdoms]], is located in a small region of the [[Western Cape]] and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are [[evergreen]] hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like [[leaf|leaves]], such as the [[sclerophyllous]] plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the [[protea]] genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.

While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few [[forest]]s. Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the [[humid]] [[coastal plain]] along the [[Indian Ocean]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] (see [[KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic]]). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of [[fire]], known as montane forests (see [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests]]). [[Plantation]]s of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native [[eucalyptus]] and [[pine]]. South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to [[overpopulation]], sprawling development patterns and [[deforestation]] during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g. [[Acacia mearnsii|Black Wattle]], [[Acacia saligna|Port Jackson]], [[Hakea]], [[Lantana]] and [[Jacaranda]]) posing a significant threat to the native [[biodiversity]] and the already scarce water resources. The original [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate forest]] that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African [[hardwood]] trees like [[Real Yellowwood]] ''(Podocarpus latifolius)'', [[Ocotea bullata|stinkwood]] ''(Ocotea bullata)'', and South African [[Black Ironwood]] ''(Olea laurifolia)'' are under government protection.

Numerous [[mammal]]s are found in the [[bushveld]] habitats including [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[white rhino]]s, [[blue wildebeest]], [[kudu]]s, [[impala]]s, [[hyena]]s, [[hippopotamus]] and [[giraffe]]s. A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including [[Kruger National Park]] and the [[Mala Mala]] Reserve, as well as in the far north in the [[Waterberg Biosphere]].

Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI)<ref name = "SANBI">[http://www.sanbi.org South African National Biodiversity Institute].</ref> (along with many of its partner institutions), parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the [[Northern Cape]] in late spring and summertime by 2050.

The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global [[biodiversity hotspots]] since it will be hit very hard by [[climate change]] and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these [[rare species]] towards [[extinction]]. The book ''[[Scorched: South Africa's Changing Climate]]'' takes much of the modelling produced by SANBI and presents it in an accessible travelogue-style collection of essays.<ref>[http://www.scorched.co.za Scorched]: South Africa's changing climate.</ref>

South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the [[critically endangered]] [[Riverine Rabbit]] (''Bunolagus monticullaris'') in the [[Karoo]].

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of South Africa}}
[[Image:Cape Town Waterfront.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]] in [[Cape Town]] with [[Table Mountain]] in the background. Cape Town has become an important [[retail]] and [[tourism]] centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa]]
By [[UN]] classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a [[stock exchange]] (the [[JSE Securities Exchange|JSE Limited]]), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 20th in the world in terms of [[GDP]] (PPP) as of 2007.

Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.

Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind [[Libya]], [[Mauritius]] it suffers from large income gaps and a [[dual economy]] marking it as a [[developing country]]. South Africa has one of the highest rates of [[List of countries by income equality|income inequality]] in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality, [[Statistics South Africa]] reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household.<ref>[http://www.sarpn.org.za/documents/d0000164/page1.php SARPN - South Africa<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.sarpn.org.za</ref>
The [[affirmative action]] policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=261345&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__business/|title=Black middle class boosts car sales in South Africa: Mail & Guardian Online<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> Other problems are crime, corruption, and HIV/AIDS.

At the start of 2000, President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of [[privatisation]], and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised [[labour movement|labour]].<!-- It is estimated that South Africa accounts for up to 30% of the [[gross domestic product]] of the entire African continent.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} commented out until citation is found --> South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investec.com/NR/rdonlyres/13AEE8DD-1266-420D-B7BE-DCF92C12967F/4035/TourismUpdateOctober2005.pdf |title=SA Economic Research - Tourism Update |accessdate=2008-06-23 |year=2005 |month=10 |publisher=[http://www.investec.com/ Investec]|format=PDF}}</ref> Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.

The South African [[South African rand|rand]] (ZAR), is the most actively-traded emerging [[market currency]] in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the [[Continuous linked settlement]] (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across [[time zone]]s. The rand was the best-performing currency against the [[United States dollar]] (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] Currency Scorecard.

The volatility of the rand has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85 ZAR to the [[U.S. dollar|USD]], raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase [[interest rate]]s. The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.

Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans, [[xenophobia]] is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the [[construction]], [[tourism]], [[agriculture]] and [[domestic service]] industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/ASR/5No4/StrategigPerspectives.html|title=African Security Review Vol&nbsp;5 No&nbsp;4, 1996: Strategic Perspectives on Illegal Immigration into South Africa}}</ref> However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queensu.ca/samp/sampresources/samppublications/policyseries/policy20.htm|title=Queens College: The Brain Gain: Skilled Migrants and Immigration Policy in Post-Apartheid South Africa}}</ref>

Principal international trading partners of South Africa — besides other African countries — include Germany, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Chief exports include corn, diamonds, fruits, gold, metals and minerals, sugar, and wool. Machinery and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the country’s imports. Other imports include chemicals, manufactured goods, and petroleum.

===Electricity crisis===
After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ([[Eskom]]) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide [[rolling blackout]]s. Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at [[Koeberg nuclear power station]], but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/world/africa/31safrica.html "Power Failures Outrage South Africa"] article by [[Barry Bearak]] and [[Celia W. Dugger]] in [[The New York Times]] 31 January 2008</ref> although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7199814.stm|title=S Africa cuts power to neighbours|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=21 January 2008|accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
[[Image:Farm in Mpumalanga.jpg|thumb|right|Workers planting on a farm in the central area of [[Mpumalanga]].]]
[[Image:SouthAfricaFieldwork21989.jpg|thumb|right|Farm workers.]]
South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of [[farming]] products. There are almost a thousand [[agricultural cooperative]]s and [[agribusiness]]es throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] for the nation.<ref name = "HRW">Human Rights Watch, 2001. [http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/safrica2/ Unequal Protection]: The State Response to Violent Crime on South African Farms, ISBN 1-56432-263-7.</ref> However, due to the [[arid]]ity of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land.<ref> Mohamed, Najma. 2000. "Greening Land and Agrarian Reform: A Case for Sustainable Agriculture", in ''At the Crossroads: Land and Agrarian Reform in South Africa into the 21st century'', ed. Cousins, Ben. Bellville, School of Government, University of the Western Cape. ISBN 1-86808-467-1.</ref>

Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on [[subsistence agriculture]]. It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being [[sugar]], [[grape]]s, [[citrus]], [[nectarine]]s, [[winemaking|wine]] and [[deciduous]] fruit. The largest locally produced crop is [[maize]] (corn), and it has been estimated that 9&nbsp;million tons are produced every year, with 7.4&nbsp;million tons being consumed. [[Livestock]] are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.southafrica.co.za/agriculture_29.html | work = South Africa Online | title = Agriculture |accessdate= 2006-07-17}}</ref>

In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as [[land reform]] and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe's land reform policy]] may develop,<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1052-2352011,00.html South Africa's bitter harvest].</ref> a fear exacerbated by comments made by [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka|deputy president]], the deputy president of South Africa.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4718707.stm South Africans' long wait for land], BBC News.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4140990.stm SA 'to learn from' land seizures], BBC News.</ref> The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of not devoting enough time and money to tackle the problem of [[South African farm attacks|farm attacks]] as opposed to other forms of violent crime.<ref name = "Times">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article694534.ece Farms of Fear], The Sunday Times Magazine.</ref>

Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape.<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/114303555233.htm Climate change to create African 'water refugees' – scientists], Reuters Alertnet. Accessed 21 September 2006].</ref> To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes [[sustainable development]] and the use of natural resources.<ref>[http://www.nda.agric.za/ Department of Agriculture South Africa].</ref>'''

By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the [[Zulu]], [[Xhosa]], [[Basotho]] (South Sotho), [[Bapedi]] (North Sotho), [[Venda people|Venda]], [[Tswana]], [[Shangaan|Tsonga]], [[Swazi]] and [[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Ndebele]], all of which speak [[Bantu languages]] (see ''[[Bantu peoples of South Africa]]'').

Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The [[Basotho]] group is also the major ethnic group in [[Lesotho]]. The [[Tswana]] ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of [[Botswana]]. The [[Swazi]] ethnic group is the major ethnic group in [[Swaziland]]. The [[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Ndebele]] ethnic group is also found in [[Matabeleland]] in [[Zimbabwe]], where they are known as the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Matabele]]. These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior [[Mzilikazi]] that escaped persecution from [[Shaka]] by migrating to their current territory. The [[Shangaan|Tsonga]] ethnic group is also found in southern [[Mozambique]], where they are known as the Shangaan.

The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups: [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Fleming|Flemish]], [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]], German, French [[Huguenot]], English, Irish, Scottish and [[Wales|Welsh]]. Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the [[Afrikaners]], who speak [[Afrikaans]], and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see ''[[Anglo-African]]''). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The [[White people|white population]] is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high [[Crime in South Africa|crime]] rate and the [[affirmative action]] policies of the government. Since 1994, more than 100 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated.<ref name = "Fin24">[http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-25_2003186 Million whites leave SA- study]</ref><ref name = "Unisa">[http://www.unisa.ac.za/default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&ContentID=13537 Unisa].</ref><ref name = "Queen’s U">[http://www.queensu.ca/samp/sampresources/samppublications/policyseries/policy23.htm Policy Series], Queen’s University.</ref><ref name = "Economist">[http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4277319 The Economist].</ref> Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British expats coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British expats moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of [[Whites in Zimbabwe|white Zimbabwean]] arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "[[Whenwe]]s", because of their nostalgia for their lives in [[Rhodesia]] "when we were in Rhodesia".<ref name="New Internationalist">{{cite web | url = http://www.newint.org/issue155/briefly.htm | title = Rhodie oldies | year = 1985 | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | publisher = ''[[New Internationalist]]''}}</ref>

The term [[Coloured]] is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous [[Khoisan]] who lived in the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] at the time, indigenous African Blacks, Whites (mostly the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]/[[Afrikaner]] and British settlers) as well as an admixture of [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], Indian, [[Malagasy]] and Asian blood (such as [[Bamar|Burmese]]). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The [[Khoikhoi]], who were called ''Hottentots'' by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called [[Bushmen]] by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]); [[Namibia]] and immigrants of mixed descent from India and [[Myanmar|Burma]] ([[Anglo-Indians]]/[[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]]) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.

The major part of the South African [[Asians in South Africa|Asian]] population is Indian in origin (see [[Indian South Africans]]); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the [[sugar]] [[plantation]]s of the eastern coastal area then known as [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]]. There is also a significant group of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] South Africans (approximately 100,000 individuals) and [[Overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese]] South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans are to be reclassified as [[black people]]. As a result of this ruling, ethnically Chinese citizens will be able to benefit from government [[Black Economic Empowerment|BEE]] policies.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4168245.ece We agree that you are black, South African court tells Chinese], The Times</ref>

South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the ''World Refugee Survey 2008'', published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.<ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008">{{cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008|publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants|date=2008-06-19|url=http://www.refugees.org/survey}}</ref> Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included persons from [[Zimbabwe]] (48,400), The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (24,800), and [[Somalia]] (12,900).<ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008">{{cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008|publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants|date=2008-06-19|url=http://www.refugees.org/survey}}</ref> These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.<ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008">{{cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008|publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants|date=2008-06-19|url=http://www.refugees.org/survey}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
{{main|Culture of South Africa}}
[[Image:SafrikaIMG 8414.JPG|thumb|right|[[Prison]] Buildings on [[Robben Island]], the holding place of several [[apartheid|anti-apartheid]] fighters including [[Nelson Mandela]], who was imprisoned there for eighteen years. Robben Island is now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]]]
[[Image:SouthAfricaDecoratedHouses.jpg|thumb|right|Decorated houses, [[Drakensberg Mountains]]]]
It may be argued that there is no "single" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to [[food]], [[music]] and [[dance]] feature prominently.

[[South African cuisine]] is heavily [[meat|meat-based]] and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a ''[[braai]]'', or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major [[wine]] producer, with some of the best [[vineyard]]s lying in valleys around [[Stellenbosch]], [[Franschoek]], [[Paarl]] and [[Barrydale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewinedoctor.com/regionalguides/southafrica.shtml|title=thewinedoctor.com}}</ref>

There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called [[Kwaito]]. Of note is [[Brenda Fassie]], who launched to fame with her song "Weekend Special", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], while the [[Soweto String Quartet]] performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as [[Seether]] (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably [[Hugh Masekela]], [[Jonas Gwangwa]], [[Abdullah Ibrahim]], [[Miriam Makeba]], [[Jonathan Butler]], [[Chris McGregor]], and [[Sathima Bea Benjamin]]. [[Afrikaans]] music covers multiple genres, such as the [[contemporary music|contemporary]] [[Steve Hofmeyr]] and the [[punk rock]] band [[Fokofpolisiekar]]. Crossover artists such as [[Johnny Clegg]] and his bands [[Juluka]] and [[Savuka]] have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.

The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly [[urbanisation|urbanised]] and [[Western world|westernised]], aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or [[Afrikaans]] in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of [[Khoisan languages]] who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of [[endangered language]]s, most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.

The [[middle class]] lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/default/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&ArticleID=1518-25_2117122|title=Black middle class explodes|date=22 May 2007|publisher=FIN24}}</ref> is similar in many respects to that of people found in [[Western Europe]], North America and [[Australasia]]. Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.

[[Asians in South Africa|Asians]], predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either [[Christian]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]] or [[Sunni Muslim]] and speaking English, with Indian languages like [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous [[Truro (ship)|Truro ship]] as [[indentured servant|indentured labourers]] in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan).

South Africa has also had a large influence in the [[Scouting]] movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The [[South African Scout Association]] was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as ''Quo Vadis''.<ref name="scouthistorypage">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006| url = http://www.scouting.org.za/visitors/history.html | title = History of Scouting in South Africa | format = | work = History of Scouting in South Africa| publisher = South African Scout Association | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref>

The South African music scene consists of [[Kwaito]], a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after [[Apartheid]], and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense, [[Kwaito]] is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like [[Sony]], [[BMG]], and [[EMI]] have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute [[Kwaito]] music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country, [[Kwaito]] has taken over radio, television, and magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2822/is_3_28/ai_n15648564/pg_5|title=South African music after Apartheid: kwaito, the "party politic," and the appropriation of gold as a sign of success | Popular Music and Society | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

[[Kwaito]], much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically-driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their "own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/what_happening/news/features/kwaitomental.htm|title=Kwaito: much more than music - SouthAfrica.info<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> According to TIMEeurope magazine, "The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio" .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/040419/kwaito.html|title=TIMEeurope Magazine | Viewpoint<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> In the kwaito, the samples from old school [[Jamaican dancehall]], European house, etc., [[tempos]] are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 40&nbsp;million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for "gold" certification in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/what_happening/news/features/kwaitomental.htm|title=Kwaito: much more than music - SouthAfrica.info<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in South Africa}}
According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes [[Zion Christian]] 11.1%, [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] ([[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]]) 8.2%, [[Roman Catholicism in South Africa|Roman Catholic]] 7.1%, [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa|Methodist]] 6.8%, [[Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk|Dutch Reformed]] 6.7%, [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] 3.8%, and other Christian 36%. [[Islam in South Africa|Islam]] accounted for 1.5% of the population, [[Hinduism in South Africa|Hinduism]] about 1.3%, and Judaism 0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified.<ref>[[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sf.html Factbook]], CIA.</ref><ref>{{cite web

African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the [[Christian]] groups.
It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to [[African traditional religion|traditional indigenous religions]]. Many peoples have [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences.<ref name = "DoS">[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71325.htm Department of State], USA.</ref>

[[Islam in South Africa]] itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring [[Mozambique]] had with [[Arab]] and [[East Africa]]n traders{{Fact|date=May 2007}}. There is no evidence that Islam was known to the [[Zulu]], [[Swazi]], or [[Xhosa]] of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as [[Coloured]]s, notably in the [[Western Cape]], especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the [[Cape Malays]]). Others are described as [[Asians in South Africa|Indians]], notably in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], including those whose ancestors came as traders from [[South Asia]]; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that [[Islam]] is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0110/p13s1-woaf.html|title=In South Africa, many blacks convert to Islam}}</ref> with the number of black [[Muslim]]s growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14286&sec=33&con=58|title=Muslims say their faith growing fast in Africa}}</ref>

[[Hinduism in South Africa|Hinduism]] dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON.
Other religions in smaller numbers are [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in South Africa|Bahá'í Faith]].<ref>{{cite web

South Africa has eleven [[official language]]s:<ref>Constitution of South Africa, Chapter 1, Section 6 [http://www.fs.gov.za/Departments/SAC/Library/DEPART/lang_legislation1.htm]</ref>
[[Northern Sotho language|Sepedi]], [[Sotho language|Sesotho]], [[Tswana language|Setswana]], [[Swati language|siSwati]], [[Venda language|Tshivenda]], [[Tsonga language|Xitsonga]], [[Afrikaans]], [[South African English|English]], [[Southern Ndebele language|isiNdebele]], [[Xhosa language|isiXhosa]] and [[Zulu language|isiZulu]]. In this regard it is [[Official languages of India|second only to India]] in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%).<ref name = "Census2001"/> Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%).<ref name = "Census2001"/>

There are [[Official names of South Africa|eleven official names]] for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages: [[Fanagalo language|Fanagalo]], [[Khoe language|Khoe]], [[Lobedu language|Lobedu]], [[Nama language|Nama]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]], [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], [[San language|San]] and [[South African Sign Language]]{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.

Many of the "unofficial languages" of the [[Bushmen|San]] and [[Khoikhoi]] people contain regional [[dialect]]s stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming [[Extinct language|extinct]].

Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and [[Greek language|Greek]], while some [[Asians in South Africa|Asians]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] in South Africa speak [[South Asia]]n languages, such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]].

===Sports===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=June 2008}}
The main sports in South Africa are [[Association football|soccer]], [[rugby union|rugby]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]] and [[lawn bowls]]. Other sports with significant support are [[swimming]], [[golf]] and [[netball]]. [[Basketball]], [[surfing]] and [[skateboarding]] are popular among the youth.

Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake [[Jacob Matlala]], [[Vuyani Bungu]], [[Welcome Ncita]], [[Dingaan Thobela]], [[Gerrie Coetzee]] and [[Brian Mitchell]]. Football players who have excelled in international clubs include [[Lucas Radebe]] of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Quinton Fortune]], formerly of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Benni McCarthy]] and [[Aaron Mokoena]] of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Steven Pienaar]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. South Africa produced [[Formula 1]] motor racing's 1979 world champion [[Jody Scheckter]].

South Africa hosted and won the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] at their first attempt and again won the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in [[France national rugby union team|France]]. South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of [[Apartheid]]. It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the [[1996 African Cup of Nations]] football tournament. It also hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] and the [[ICC World Twenty20|2007 World Twenty20 Championship]]. South Africa will be the host nation for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.

In 2004, the team of [[Roland Schoeman]], [[Lyndon Ferns]], [[Darian Townsend]] and [[Ryk Neethling]] won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay. [[Penny Heyns]] won Olympic Gold in the 1996 [[Atlanta Olympic Games]].

In golf, [[Gary Player]] is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Career Grand Slam]], one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include [[Bobby Locke]], [[Ernie Els]], [[Retief Goosen]] and [[Trevor Immelman]].

==Current issues==
===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in South Africa}}
The spread of [[AIDS]] (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm |title=HIV & Aids in South Africa |publisher=Avert |accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president [[Thabo Mbeki]] and then health minister [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]], who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/21094 |title="Sack SA Health Minister" – world's AIDS experts |publisher=afrol News |accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2007/aidsplan2007/situation_analysis.pdf|title=info.gov.za|format=PDF}}</ref>  In September of 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and [[Kgalema Motlanthe]] was appointed for the interim.  One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the widely respected [[Barbara Hogan]].

AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support.<ref name="avertaids">{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/aidsorphans.htm |title=AIDS orphans |publisher=Avert |accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa.<ref name="avertaids"/> Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5&nbsp;million people are infected with the disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2007/aidsplan2007/situation_analysis.pdf|title=info.gov.za|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Crime===
{{main|Crime in South Africa}}
According to a survey for the period 1998–2000 compiled by the [[United Nations]], South Africa was ranked second for [[murder]] and first for [[assault]]s and [[rape]]s per capita.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/red/country/sf/Crime&b_cite=1|title=NationMaster: South African Crime Statistics}}</ref> Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.

Crime has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into [[gated community|gated communities]], abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in [[Johannesburg]], although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. {{Fact|date=January 2008}} Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave. [[South African Farmer Murders|Crime against the farming community]] has continued to be a major problem.<ref>{{cite news

===Skills migration===
Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "[[brain drain]]" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy,<ref>http://jae.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/suppl_2/ii15 World Bank, IMF study 2004</ref> and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic.<ref>http://www.equinetafrica.org/bibl/docs/healthpersonnel.pdf Health Personnel in Southern Africa: Confronting maldistribution and brain drain</ref> The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad.<ref name ="mig_study">http://www-ilo-mirror.cornell.edu/public/english/protection/migrant/download/imp/imp52e.pdf Skilled Labour Migration from Developing Countries: Study on South and Southern Africa</ref>
