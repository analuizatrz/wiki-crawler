==Plot==
[[Image:Parineeta 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Shekhar and Lolita on the day of their apparent marriage.]]This film adaptation of [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]'s 1914 novella, ''[[Parineeta]]'', places the story in the [[Kolkata]] of 1962. As the credits roll, scenes from the erstwhile [[Calcutta]] are displayed along with the narrator's ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) introduction of the era to the audience. The narration focuses on the night of the marriage of Shekhar ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) and Gayatri Tantya ([[Diya Mirza]]), a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Navin Rai ([[Sabyasachi Chakravarthy]]) as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar readying himself for the occasion. While he is doing that, images of Lolita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighborhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lolita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married. 

[[Image:Parineeta 2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Girish and Charu during their card game with Lolita and Koel.]]An angry Shekhar comes back home to play a favorite tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing the [[Rabindranath Tagore]]’s tune on his piano while young Lolita and Koel are around. Lolita, with her parents having died in a car accident, lives with Gurcharan’s family whereas Koel and Charu are her neighbors. As this scene flashes across Shekhar’s mind, he sings a song full of sadness and loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. A rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar, spends his days playing the music of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] or [[Elvis Presley]] and composing his own songs with Lolita, rather than becoming part of his shrewd father's world of profit and business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantia ([[Diya Mirza]]), the beautiful but, devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry into. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Koel’s house. Girish seems smitten by Lolita whereas Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lolita’s close friendship with Girish.

One day, a shocked Lolita, who’s employed at the Rai’s office, realises of a hotel project from Gurcharan’s ancestral ''haveli'' (palatial house). On an earlier occasion, Gurcharan had borrowed money from Navin Rai after putting his ''haveli'' on mortage. She understands that if the money is not be repayed in a few months, Navin Rai would take over the property. She immediately thinks of asking Shekhar for monetary help. Unforeseen circumstances prevent this and Girish upon realising this, alleviates their problem by making Gurcharan his business partner. Gurcharan repays the debt and the turn of events prompts Shekhar to think why Lolita chose to ask Girish for money instead of him. On one auspicious night, Shekhar and Lolita apparently get married without anyone’s knowledge. 

[[Image:Parineeta 3.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Shekhar confronting his father about Lolita, his wife.]]While Shekhar is off to [[Darjeeling]] on a business trip, Navin Rai violently thunders on Lolita about the loss of his hotel project embarrassing and humiliating her. Rai gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolizing the end of their association. Gurcharan unable to digest this faces a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Rai informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lolita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is digusted to hear of the marriage and in the anger he scowls at Lolita, humiliating her like his father. In the meanwhile, Girish assists the Gurcharan family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lolita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s ''haveli''. With a shock, Shekhar realises that Lolita denied Girish's marriage proposal and thereby he married Koel. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lolita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother.

== Production ==
=== The key elements ===
Prior to ''Parineeta'', [[Pradeep Sarkar]] was a well-known personality in the area of [[advertisement]]s. With 17 years in mainstream advertising and 7 years of advertisement film-making and commercial cinema, he completed about 1000 [[Television advertisement|commercials]] and 15 music videos.<ref name="pradeepintro">{{cite news|accessdate=2007-10-22|url=http://www.movietalkies.com/artists/complete-profie.asp?ArtistId=44267
|title=Pradeep Sarkar profile}}</ref> [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]], the film's producer, took notice of his music videos and contacted Sarkar to direct some of the music videos of the film, [[Mission Kashmir]] (2000).<ref name="ref2">{{cite web|work=Hindu.com|title=A debut at 52!|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/08/18/stories/2007081851940600.htm}}</ref> After carving a niche in filming music videos, Sarkar gave the thought of filming ''Parineeta'' to Chopra.<ref name="ref2">{{cite web|work=Hindu.com|title=A debut at 52!|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/08/18/stories/2007081851940600.htm}}</ref> There began the making of the film. 

About the film's comparison with the novel, Chopra said in an interview that, as compared to its [[Parineeta (1953 film)|1953 namesake film]] by Bimal Roy, the film's story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them one and a half years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasizing under-represented characters from the novel.<ref name="chopra1">{{cite web|work=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-10-22|first=Tanmaya Kumar|last=Nanda|title='Judge me by the highest standards'|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/10chopra.htm}}</ref><ref name="chopra2">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-22|first=Anuj|last=Kumar|work=Hindu.com|title=A maverick, period!|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2005061001970400.htm&date=2005/06/10/&prd=fr&}}</ref> In a separate interview, Chopra admitted that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. When speaking about cinematic adaptation, Chopra gave due credit to Sarkar, and Natarajan Subramaniam (the film's cinematographer), for providing the vintage visuals in the film.<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title="Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> [[Saif Ali Khan]] once said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. When the film's crew did not find the depiction appealing, the filming began with the ''60's'' look.<ref name="refsaif">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-22|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/saif-ali-khan.html|title=Saif Ali Khan spills Parineeta secrets!|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref>

Chopra once cited an interesting anecdote about his belief in Sarkar's film making abilities. He said that he never personally signed the [[cheques]] for the film's expenditure. He transferred money into Sarkar's bank account and the cheques were eventually signed by Sarkar and his spouse.<ref name="chopra1">{{cite web|work=Rediff.com|title='Judge me by the highest standards'|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/10chopra.htm}}</ref>

=== Casting ===
Chopra said in an interview that [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Vidya Balan]] were not the first choices for the lead roles in ''Parineeta''.<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title="Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> This fact was corroborated by Saif  in an interview<ref name="refsaif">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/saif-ali-khan.html|title=Saif Ali Khan spills Parineeta secrets!|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him. 

The choice of Vidya Balan came with Sarkar's prior work experience with her in three music videos.<ref name="balan2">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-23|first=Ronjita|last=Kulkarni|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/08vidya2.htm|title=How it began for Vidya?|work=Rediff.com}}</ref> Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested for a period of 6 months and only then they were sure of her acting abilities.<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title= "Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> Saif once said that he was not convinced of Vidya's abilities, since ''Parineeta'' was to be her first film.<ref name="balan">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-23|first=Ronjita|last=Kulkarni|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/08vidya1.htm|title=Meet the new girl in Saif's life!|work=Rediff.com}}</ref> He instead hoped to work with established actresses like [[Aishwarya Rai]] or [[Rani Mukherjee]]. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of ''Lolita'', he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance.<ref name="refsaif">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/saif-ali-khan.html|title=Saif Ali Khan spills Parineeta secrets!|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to enact made Vidya accept the role of ''Lolita''.<ref name="balan2">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-23|first=Ronjita|last=Kulkarni|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/08vidya3.htm|title=Hello Vidya!

[[Image:Greencar.jpg|thumb|right|Shekhar and his friend in the green car.]]The choice of [[Sanjay Dutt]] was because of his versatility, said Chopra in an interview. He also said that the affable nature of Sanjay was a plus during film making.<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title="Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> 

[[Diya Mirza]] liked the script so well that she chose to play the role of the devious ''Gayatri'' in spite of it being a short role.<ref name="diyaraima">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-23|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/diya-raima.html|title=Interview - Diya Mirza and Raima sen|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> [[Raima Sen]] had a similar story with her want to work with the duo of Chopra and Sarkar.<ref name="diyaraima">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-23|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/diya-raima.html|title=Interview - Diya Mirza and Raima sen|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> The cameo of the veteran actress, [[Rekha]] was purely out of her interest in the song, ''[[Kaisi Paheli Zindgani]]''.<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title= "Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref>

=== Filming and music ===

[[Image:Parineeta The Film.JPG|180px|thumb|right|Shekhar ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) playing the piano while Lolita ([[Vidya Balan]]) sings [[Piyu Bole]].]]Since Sarkar knew the city of [[Kolkata]] very well, the film was primarily shot there.<ref name="kolkata">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-24|first=Rohini|last=Bhandari|url=http://www.businessofcinema.com/boc/?file=story&id=5367|title=Interview - Pradeep Sarkar|work=Businessofcinema.com}}</ref> While most of the film was made in Kolkata, a small portion was shot in Darjeeling.<ref name="chopra2">{{cite web|work=Hindu.com|title= A maverick, period!|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2005061001970400.htm&date=2005/06/10/&prd=fr&}}</ref>  

To re-create the 60s era, lot of efforts were made by the producers. For instance, Chopra said that it cost them money and difficulty to procure the green colored car which was driven by ''Shekhar'' in the film. Chopra confirmed the authenticity of the piano used in the song, ''[[Piyu Bole]]''<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title="Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> and of the toy train used in a song (''[[Kasto Mazza]]'').<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/vidhu-vinod-chopra.html|title="Small people with big egos, not for me!" - Vidhu Vinod Chopra|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref><ref name="balan2">{{cite web|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/08vidya4.htm|title=Acting with Saif|work=Rediff.com}}</ref> About the look of the characters, Mirza said that the 60s look was well captured by the make-up artist, Vidyadar.<ref name="diyaraima">{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/interview/diya-raima.html|title=Interview - Diya Mirza and Raima sen|work=Indiainfo.com}}</ref> 

Critics had high expectations from Parineeta's music<ref name="musicexpect">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiafm.com/movies/musicreview/11638/index.html|accessdate=2007-10-26|title=Music Review: Parineeta|work=Indiafm.com|first=Joginder|last=Tuteja}}</ref> because of the award-winning music that was provided in (some of) Chopra's previous films (''[[1942: A Love Story]] (1993)''<ref name="1942awards">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109010/awards|accessdate=2007-10-26|title=1942: A Love Story (1993) - Awards|work=IMDB}}</ref>,  ''[[Mission Kashmir]] (2000)''<ref name="missionkashawards">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248185/awards|accessdate=2007-10-26|title=Mission Kashmir (2000) - Awards|work=IMDB}}</ref>). [[Shantanu Moitra]], ''Parineeta's'' music director composed hundreds of tunes before six of them got finalised after a year's effort. After finalising the soundtrack, Chopra was appreciative of the musician's abilities when he said that Moitra has the potential to become another [[R. D. Burman]], a legendary [[Bollywood]] music director.<ref name="moitra">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/life/2005/06/24/stories/2005062400130300.htm|accessdate=2007-10-26|title= An entertainer ''par excellence''|work=The Hindu Business Line|first=V.|last=Gangadhar}}</ref>

== Cultural and cinematic allusions ==
[[Image:Parineeta A.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Lolita on the swing resembling Satyajit Ray's Charu.]]Cinematic works by [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] such as ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]] (2006)'', ''[[Eklavya: The Royal Guard]] (2007)''<ref name="chopramovies">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-24|work=IMDB|title=Vidhu Vinod Chopra|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006765/}}</ref> contained [[allusion]]s to important figures (''[[Mahatma Gandhi]]'', ''[[Eklavya]]'') from the [[India]]n literature. ''Parineeta (2005)'' continued his tradition when it was based on [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]'s [[novella]], ''[[Parineeta]]''. The author was a known contemporary of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]<ref name="saratchandra">{{cite web|first=Indrani Roy|last=Mitra|accessdate=2007-10-24|work=Rediff.com|title=The man behind Devdas, Parineeta|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/20mspec.htm}}</ref>; both authors documented Bengali life and social issues at the turn of the 20th century.<ref name="saratchandra">{{cite web|first=Indrani Roy|last=Mitra|accessdate=2007-10-24|work=Rediff.com|title=The man behind Devdas, Parineeta|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/20mspec.htm}}</ref><ref name="tagore">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-24|title=Rabindranath Tagore|url=http://www.schoolofwisdom.com/tagore-bio.html}}</ref> 

This film was the third in the list of movies that bore resemblance to the novella, the other two being its [[Parineeta (1953 film)|1953 namesake film]] and Sankoch (1976).<ref name="similarmovies">{{cite web|last=N|first=Patcy|accessdate=2007-10-24|title=The different faces of Parineeta|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jun/08patcy.htm}}</ref> 

''Parineeta (2005)'' also pays [[homage]] to filmmaker, [[Satyajit Ray]]'s film ''[[Charulata]]'', which is based upon Tagore's noted novella, ''[[Nashtanir]]''.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news|first=Pratim D.|last=Gupta|accessdate=2007-10-10|title=Parineeta breathes Bengal among the tulips|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050611/asp/nation/story_4854277.asp}}</ref> In the song ''[[Soona Man Ka Aangan]]'', ''Lolita'' is dressed to resemble ''Charu'' ([[Madhabi Mukherjee]]) from Tagore's song ''Fule Fule Dhole Dhole''.

=== Reviews, critiques and controversies ===
Prior to the film's release on [[June 10]], [[2005]], one preview wondered how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the [[Parineeta (1953 film)|1953 version]], the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray ''Lolita's'' character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporaries, Sanjay Dutt and Saif Ali Khan, and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments for the film to be a successful adaptation.<ref name="bollywoodcritics">{{cite news|accessdate=2007-10-27|url=http://www.bollywood.com/archives/2005/06/parineeta_could.html
