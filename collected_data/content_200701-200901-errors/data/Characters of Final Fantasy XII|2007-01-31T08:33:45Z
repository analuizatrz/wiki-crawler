{{nihongo|'''Vaan'''|ヴァン|Van}} is a 17-year-old orphaned [[Races of Final Fantasy#Humans|Hume]] street urchin who lost his parents in a plague when he was 12 years old and his only brother Reks two years before the start of the game, during the Archadian Invasion of Dalmasca. Reks's death is especially challenging for Vaan to cope with, being his only true remaining family. He makes a living as Migelo's assistant, running various errands for him, while at the same time pickpocketing from Archadian soldiers, claiming to take back what is Dalmasca's. He is a cheerful and energetic lad, and among his friends he is considered their leader. Vaan always dreams of someday becoming a sky pirate in command of his own airship. He often trains to meet this goal by killing dire rats in the sewers of Rabanastre on a daily basis, for which Dalan gave him the nickname "Vaan Ratsbane."

During the beginning of the game, he is still resentful of his brother's death at the supposed hands of Basch. However, this quickly changes as he and the party learn the truth, and he eventually decides to trust Basch.<ref>'''Vaan''': My brother trusted you. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> From this point on he actually acts as defender of Basch to Ashe, who initially hated him as well. Vaan also has a hidden secret: he is frustrated with the mere fact he is incapable of helping Dalmasca. As he stated to Ashe in the Garif town of Jahara, Vaan would claim to be a "sky pirate - or some other stupid thing", simply so that he could ignore his own feelings of helplessness and confusion before the Empire. Mirroring Ashe's own frustration with her inability to defeat the Empire, Vaan's frustration turns itself into a desire to see the journey through; as he states to Ashe, he believes that if he just keeps following her, he can find his own answers. Vaan is unique in that, despite being the player character for most of the game, he is not the leader of the party - as he states to Basch and Penelo when the party reaches Archades, he's just going along with the party, following Ashe. 

Vaan eventually "gave up" his dream of being a sky pirate, since it was just a way to release his frustration; ironically, despite this, he becomes a sky pirate anyway. Balthier, who'd noticed during the game that Vaan thought more and more like a sky pirate with each passing moment, showed him how to fly the Strahl, and showed him life as a sky pirate. Vaan took the Strahl at the end of the game, though Fran and Balthier took it back; Vaan and Penelo, now full-fledged sky pirates on their own, gain their own small airship, currently unnamed. 

Vaan returns in the sequel, "Revenant Wings", this time as the hero of the story.

'''Ashelia''' or {{nihongo|'''Ashe B'nargin Dalmasca'''|アーシェ・バナルガン・ダルマスカ|Āshe Banarugan Darumasuka}} is a 19-year-old Hume princess fighting to liberate her kingdom, Dalmasca, from the Archadian Empire. She was thought to have committed suicide, but took on the alias, '''Amalia''', to serve as the leader of the Resistance before joining the group. Though intent on getting revenge on Archadia for the horrors its militant forces had committed on her people, Ashe's own lineage and malice were manipulated by the Occuria.

{{nihongo|'''Balthier'''|バルフレア|Barufurea|'''Balflear''' in the original [[Japanese language]] version}} is a 22-year-old Hume sky pirate who pilots the ''Strahl'', a small [[airship (video game)|airship]], around the skies of Ivalice. He and his companion, Fran, prefer to remain outside of the war between the kingdoms of Ivalice. However, their attempt to steal a magicite (actually the Dusk Shard Nethicite) went bad; Vaan stole it first, and events forced them to join up in the Resistance over time. 

Born {{nihongo|'''Ffamran Mid Bunansa'''|ファムラン・ミド・ブナンザ|Famuran Mido Bunanza}}, he is the son of Dr. [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]], though he grew weary of his father's madness and obsession with Nethicite. Although Cid had made him an Imperial Judge, Ffamran eventually decided to cut his ties with his father and his role as a judge, becoming a sky pirate under a new name. With this new career change, Balthier amounted a sizable bounty on his head, attracting the attention of bounty hunters such as Ba'Gamnan. Unfortunately for Balthier, it took him a while to realize he'd been following his father in pursuing Nethicite while he served in the resistance.

Balthier claims to be the "leading man" of the story many times throughout the game, and insists that this status makes him invincible. <ref>'''Balthier''': And what did they say about the leading man? He never dies. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> This was furthered by his near-death experience when the Sky Fortress ''Bahamut'' was destroyed near Rabanastre. Though presumed dead, he and Fran apparently retrieved the ''Strahl'' back from Vaan & Penelo, leaving a note for the new Queen Ashe, indicating he is still alive. Both he and Fran are to return in the game's sequel, [[Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings|''Revenant Wings'']]. His middle name, Mid, is a reference to [[List of Final Fantasy V characters#Mid Previa|Mid Previa]] from [[Final Fantasy V]].

===Basch fon Ronsenburg===
[[Image:Basch.jpg|120px|right|Basch]]
{| class="wikitable"

|[[Keith Ferguson]]
|[[Rikiya Koyama]]

{{nihongo|'''Sir Basch fon Ronsenburg'''|バッシュ・フォン・ローゼンバーグ|Basshu fon Rōzenbāgu}} is a 36-year-old Hume who was born in the Republic of Landis, along with his [[twin]] brother Noah. After the Archadian Empire conquered their homeland, Basch fled to Dalmasca, joining its militant force. At Nalbina Fortress, Basch led the defense, and carried the dying Lord Rasler from the battlefield. After the Archadian occupation, he and Vossler led an assault on Nalbina Fortress to save the king, only to be captured by Imperial forces. As part of Vayne's plot to frame Basch, Noah, now Gabranth, posed as his brother and slew the Dalmascan king and later Vaan's older brother, Reks, who witnessed the crime. As a result, Basch is regarded by the Dalmascans as a traitor, and was stated to have been executed by Marquis Ondore. But in reality, Basch was imprisoned alive in the Nalbina Dungeons by Vayne as a means of ensuring Ondore remains loyal to the Empire - if Ondore betrayed the Empire, all Vayne would have to do would be to announce Basch's continued survival to destroy the Marquis' credibility.

He was eventually freed by Vaan, Balthier, and Fran who were trying to escape Nalbina dungeons. Though all three were initially suspicious of him; Vaan in particular, the party did catch a look at Gabranth's face, lending credibility to Basch's story that he had been framed. After the escape, he vowed to protect Ashe and help the resistance, in spite of his past failures. He remained loyal as well, even through such events as Vossler's betrayal. 

It was Basch's devotion to honor despite everything else that most puzzled his twin, Gabranth, and was the source of the division between them. Eventually coming to respect Basch's viewpoint more than his own, Gabranth sought to redeem himself and remained true to his own devotion to Larsa Solidor, helping his brother and Ashe defeat Vayne on the ''Bahamut''.

After the battle, as Noah was dying, he asked his brother to protect Larsa in his place to ensure peace. Because common belief of Captain Ronsenberg being dead, Basch easily took over his brother's stead as "Judge Magister Gabranth" to be the protector of the new Emperor Larsa Solidor.

===Fran===
[[Image:Fran.jpg|120px|right|Fran]]
{| class="wikitable"
!English Cast!! Japanese Cast
|-
|[[Nicole Fantl]]
|[[Rika Fukami]]
|}
{{nihongo|'''Fran'''|フラン|Furan}} is a member of the [[rabbit]]-like [[Races of Final Fantasy#Viera|Viera]] race and Balthier's partner aboard his airship. She is described as proficient with a variety of weapons. She's also a good pilot and navigator, as expected of every sky pirate's partner.

Fran's hometown is Eruyt Village, a small enclave of the Viera in Golmore Jungle. Fran left Eruyt Village and cast aside the Green Word fifty years prior to the events occurring in the game, believing that as her kind began with the forest, they can not be bound to its end. She had no intention to return to the Wood ever again until she and the others needed to get to Mt. Bur-Omisace, which lay past Golmore; unfortunately, the paths were sealed by Jote, Fran's sister. Though normally the Viera would let none pass, Vaan's brashness made Jote reveal that Fran and Jote's other sister, Mjrn, was abducted by the Judges. If the party would save Mjrn, Jote would let them through. After saving Mjrn, Fran admitted that she regretted the choice she made years ago, as she is unable to hear the forest, and "fear she (the wood) hates". Jote assures her otherwise, <ref>'''Jote''': The Wood longs for you. For the child gone from under her boughs.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref>, though Fran was skeptical.<ref>'''Fran''': A pleasant lie, that. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref>

Fran, like all Viera, is exceptionally susceptible to the flows and vagaries of the Mist that permeates Ivalice; when Judge Ghis heated the Dawn Shard in his airship's engine, she could feel the Mist burning, and it threw her into a berserk rage, allowing her to easily split her iron shackles and, with her bare hands, knock down the guards imprisoning them with little trouble. Likewise, she could tell that the Mist was cooled in the Giruvegan, and of all the characters, seems to be the wisest - fitting, as she is much older than the rest of the cast.

===Penelo===
[[Image:Penelo.jpg|140px|right|Penelo as seen on FFXII]]
{| class="wikitable"

|[[Catherine Taber]]
|[[Yuna Mikuni]]

Penelo is a 17-year old Hume orphan who works as a dancer in a Rabanastre bazaar. She learned martial arts from her now-deceased older brother, a soldier, and though small in stature, she is perfectly capable of handling herself in sticky situations.

She has known Vaan since childhood, and is like a sister to him. Her parents, having took Vaan in to care for him after his own parents died, encouraged Penelo to like Vaan; having placed the two together when young, Vaan and Penelo care about each other a lot. It is unclear if this relationship will go any further, but the ending of the game reveals that they are traveling together as sky pirates, with Vaan as pilot and Penelo as navigator.

While due to the nature of Final Fantasy XII's combat system, no character is inherently good or bad at anything, there are small stat differences; these differences dictate that Penelo is the best magic user, alongside Ashe; but with higher vitality, but also consequently lower strength, in the party. This is also indicated in the sequel; Penelo returns in Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings, wearing a new outfit and using a magical staff.

{{nihongo|'''Vayne Carudas Solidor'''|ヴェイン・カルダス・ソリドール|Vein Karudasu Soridōru}} is the 27-year-old Consul of Archadia and a member of the House Solidor, whose members had led the Empire for four generations. This in effect makes him a "Prince", though as he states, the democratic nature of the Empire makes him no more eligible for the throne than anyone. He often laughs off those who attempt to give him the respect his title would command and makes genuine efforts to reach out to the conquered Dalmascans who make up his jurisdiction.

{{nihongo|'''Larsa Ferrinas Solidor'''|ラーサー・ファルナス・ソリドール|Rāsā Farunasu Soridōru}} (age 12) is the younger brother of Vayne Solidor and the fourth son of Gramis, eleventh emperor of Archadia. He was seen by the Senate as likely candidate to succeed Gramis as emperor they can control, though Larsa acts in secret like learning more about his older brother. When he met Vaan and company, Larsa assumed the alias "Lamont" so as to remain undercover, though his knowledge of Nethicite exposed him. Larsa helped Vaan and company escape from Ghis and later joined the party again at Jahara until he learned of his father's demise.

Larsa urged Ashe to use her influence on the Resistance to prevent an aggravation between the warring countries. Unlike his brother Vayne, Larsa was confident that a peaceful solution between these groups involved possible. After his brother was defeated, Larsa took his place in the Arcadian throne and settled into peace agreements.

Larsa joins the party as a guest throughout the game. Though young, he is skilled at swordplay.

===Doctor Cidolfus Demen Bunansa===
[[Image:Dr. Cid.png|110px|right|Dr. Cid]]

|John Rafter Lee
|[[Chikao Ohtsuka]]
|}
Referred to as '''Dr. Cid''', he is a 58 year old Archadian scientist who is close friends with Vayne, despite age differences, and currently engaged in studying Nethicite, the one who created all of Archadia's airships. He is revealed to be [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Balthier|Balthier]]'s father, whose ambitions drove Balthier away from the father he used to know. 

This incident was the result of Cid going to Giruvegan to study more of the Nethicite, only to return as a maniacal shell of his former self. Dr. Cid became so obsessed with his research on Nethicite, that he eventually warped his mind, making him slightly mad. Doctor Cid seems to talk to himself quite a bit, but in reality, he is speaking to Venat. Under Venat's influence, Cid helped Vayne encourage the war in order to gain shards of the Sun-Cryst in order to help him create Manufacted, or artificial Nethicite. Cid is confronted by Balthier and company at the Draklor Laboratory in Archades, which resulted in a fight after the doctor tried to kill them with two guns powered by Nethicite. Cid survives the encounter and flees. Cid and Gabranth go to the Pharos, to use the Sun-Cryst. After Gabranth is defeated, Cid decided that he was not worthy to serve as Larsa's protector anymore and told him that he was no longer needed. Enraged, Gabranth tried to attack Cid, who teleported out of the way as Venat threw the judge against a wall. Cid fought his son and the rest of the party once again, this time with help from the Esper, Famfrit. Cid died after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun Cryst before it was destroyed and fully activated his final airship, the ''Bahamut''. This is also the first Final Fantasy game to feature a [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]] as a villain.

===Archadian Judges===
The '''Archadian Judges''' are a special order of knights under the Imperial Archadian Ministry of Law. With the spread of Archadian influence came a rise in crime and regional conflicts. To reduce the amout of time required by judicial process, a military court was established, this being the origin of the Order of Judges. They are the supreme enforcers of Archadian law in the world of Ivalice. Each wields extraordinary legal power in his or her own right over lower-ranked Archadian officers. The higher ranked '''Judge Magisters''', in addition to functioning as legal administrators, are also charged with the task of guarding the royal family which effectively makes them the commanders of the Imperial Army.

The leader of the Judges whose image is on the game logo. He is also Basch's twin brother, '''Noah fon Ronsenburg''', the man truly responsible for the deaths of Reks and King Raminas. Unlike Basch, he wholeheartedly supports Archadia, enlisting after their homeland was conquered. Assuming the name of Gabranth, he served under the Emperor as Larsa's protector and Vayne's second in command. Despite these facts, Gabranth loathes himself for the framing of his brother and the horrible tasks Vayne has commanded him to do, like killing Drace to prove his loyalty as "Archadia's Dog". Towards the end of the game, after realizing why his brother remains with a positive outlook despite his life ruined, Gabranth decides to make up for his wrongs by protecting Larsa and helping the Resistance kill Vayne for the good of the empire. He is fatally injured by Vayne in the process, before Larsa arrived to his defense, and dies in Basch's arms. Basch takes up his brother's mantle, at his request, in the aftermath of the game, serving as next "Gabranth" and Larsa's protector.

{| class="wikitable"

|[[Mark Wing-Davey]]
|[[Ryunosuke Obayashi]]

Officiant of the 13th Bureau and commander of the Dreadnought ''Leviathan'', the flagship of the 8th Fleet of the Western Armada, led by Lord Vayne. In addition to official duties as Judge Magister, he also works in secret, carrying out tasks assigned him by Vayne personally. Ghis was the one responsible for guarding and supervising the young prince Larsa during his visit to Bhujerba and fought Vaan when he and the others freed Ashe. Ghis died when he arrogantly had the Dawn Shard analyzed by having it placed within the engine of the Leviathan, despite cautious advice of his subordinates. The result caused the ''Leviathan'' and all in it to implode while the shockwave destroyed the rest of Empire's 8th Fleet.

====Judge Magister Drace==== 
[[Image:JudgeDrace.jpg|105px|left|Judge Drace]]
{| class="wikitable"

|[[Julia Fletcher]]
|[[Yoko Soumi]]
|}The only female Judge. She, too, is charged with guarding Larsa but also acts as his personal advisor and makes it her responsibility to oversee his education and upbringing. Drace suspected that Vayne killed the Emperor, and attempted to arrest him. Sadly, in drawing her sword upon him, she ends up betraying her own moral conduct as a Judge. After Bergan grabbed her by the face and threw her to the ground, Vayne had her put to death by a hesitant Gabranth, so as to test the man's loyalty. Though reluctant, Drace allows it, realizing that a life serving a corrupt government was not a life worth living, but not before having Gabranth vow he would protect Larsa.

|[[Simon Templeman]]
|[[Ryūzaburō Ōtomo]]

A strictly military man who is absolutely loyal to both the Empire and the Emperor. He is granted the airship ''Alexander'' by Vayne to bring back Larsa. When ''Bahamut'' is crashing into Rabanastre, Zargabaath offers to perform a kamikaze attack with ''Alexander'' to protect the city, but Balthier's actions prevent this from being necessary. Zargabaath is the only Judge Magister who survives the events of the game.

|[[Gary Martin (actor)|Gary Martin]]
|[[Yōsuke Akimoto]]
|}
The most autocratic of all the Judges in both word and deed, as well as possibly the strongest as he manhandled Drace. He answers to Lord Vayne and is an outspoken advocate of Vayne, whom he saw the "true Dynast King",  and his intent of turning Dalmasca into a complete military dictatorship under Archadian rule.  Judge Bergan travelled to Mt. Bur-Omisace to get Larsa. Though he managed to get Larsa back, his troops attacked and killed many of the people. Bergan attacked Al-Cid and murdered Anastasis. Bergan wields two unique-looking swords, which are heavy in appearance, and used manufacted Nethicite as a booster, while being possessed by Venat. When Bergan is defeated by the main party, he seemingly died from his body being unable to withstand the Nethicite's full power.

|[[Roger L.  Jackson]]
|[[Hidekatsu Shibata]]

Father of Vayne and Larsa, fourth Emperor of Archadia.  However, even he is not immune to the scheming of the Senate who suggested that Larsa be his successor. Gramis was filled with regret for the deaths of his two oldest sons, whom he gave Vayne the order to kill. After refusing to dethrone the Senate as wished by Vayne, whom he feared would be a danger to their empire, he is eventually assassinated at Vayne's hand. With the Emperor murdered, the blame for it was focused on Chairman Gregoroth and other members of the Senate, resulting into their disbandment by the newly crowned Vayne.

===Archadian Senate===
[[Image:Senatz.jpg‎ |140px|left|The Senate]]
'''The Senate''' is a council of elderly Archadian Senators, headed by Chairman Gregoroth, who meets to discuss the course of Archadia's future in the Senate Chambers. The Senate is influential over the Emperor's decision, particularly the suggestion to remove Vayne and rein in Larsa as future heir to the Empire. Gregoroth was found to have poisoned the Emperor and commit suicide, though this is doubted even amongst the Judge Magisters. The Senate was disbanded soon after, affectively making Vayne the unprecendented ruler of Archadia.

'''Ba'Gamnan''' is a green-skinned Bangaa mercenary who is after the bounty on [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Balthier|Balthier]] and [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Fran|Fran]] by any means with the aid of his equally cruel henchmen: Rinok, Gijuk and Bwagi, who refer to him as "big brother". Though he acts as an arrogant free agent, he was working for Gabranth whom he fears to an extent. Ba'Gamnan's weapon of choice is a lance/buzzsaw composite weapon; making him an extremely dangerous opponent in battle. Even though he's a bounty hunter most foul, his notoriety is due to his illegal methods, like kidnapping Penelo and later attacking the hunters from Clan Centurio to lure out Balthier. This later strategy involved the killing the hunters, to ensure no one would be the wiser. But rumors spread and Montblanc set up "Belito" Elite Mark Hunt to lure Ba'Gamnan and his crew out into the Nam-Yensa Sandsea with aid from fellow Clan hunter Monid, Vaan and company. Ba'Gamnan and group were eventually defeated, with their leader falling into the Sandsea. Ba'Gamnan survived the Yensa and makes his return to confront/join Vaan in ''Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings''.

'''Marquis Halim Ondore IV''' is the ruler of the skycity of Bhujerba, the most recent in a line of nobles that ruled Bhujerba for generations. Ondore is also Ashe's uncle, serving as the preacher to her wedding and Rasler's funeral soon after. Ondore was rumored to have connections with the Dalmascan Liberation Army, even though he appears to have yielded to an Archadian rule. It is due to the fact that Ondore, in his attempt to keep peace with the Archadian Empire, faked the death of Basch who was in actuality being kept prisoner. But this made Ondore nothing but a "puppet ruler" blackmailed by Vayne. Once the Archadian 8th fleet was destroyed, Ondore withdrew from his position and began to gather all rebel forces and enlisted Rozarria's aid for a grand assault against the Empire.

He attempted to aid [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Larsa Solidor|Larsa]] with a plan to stop the potential war in a non-violent fashion, but the death of Gramis and the eventual dictatorship of Vayne reduced that chance to nearly nothing. Al-Cid was forced to return to his homeland to persuade his people not to take action in vain. By the time he returned, Al-Cid revealed the actions his people intend to make with "aiding" the Resistance.

'''Reddas''' is a sky pirate from Balfonheim whose crew is composed of Rikken, Raz and Elza. In truth, he was originally the missing '''Judge Magister Zecht''' of Archadia. In the war with Nabudis, he was responsible for the Midlight Shard destroying the kingdom under orders from Vanye without being told what would happen. Filled with guilt, he abandoned his post and took on the name "Reddas", arriving in Balfonheim where he cleaned up the town and became a patron to pirates.

===The Occuria===
'''The Occuria''' are immortal beings from Final Fantasy XII, often called (by both themselves and others) "the Undying". Referred to by some as gods, but unknown to the major religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a vital role in the history of Ivalice such as the creation of the Espers and granting power to King Raithwall to conquer the countries of Ivalice, granting him the Dawn, Dusk, and Midlight shards. Due to this, they are directly responsible for the formation of the Galtean Alliance and the golden days of Ivalice that followed.

It taught Doctor Cid and Vayne the secrets of Nethecite to allow them to manufacture it themselves (compare with the myth of [[Prometheus]]). This influence led to Cid's madness and Vayne's quest for power as they sought out the Nethicite shards originally cut by Raithwall for study. In response, the Gerun and the other Occurians attempted to regain their power by manipulating Ashe with an apparition of Lord Rasler. Venat's ambitions were ultimately fulfilled when Ashe resisted the Occurians' plans and Reddas destroyed the Sun-Cryst. When Vayne was weak and dying aboard the ''Bahamut'' following his defeat, he thought he failed Venat. Venat told him their goals were fulfilled beyond his knowing and the "Age of Stones" was over, and infused him with its power so that the two might "walk the path" of death together.

===Clan Centurio===
[[Image:FF12Montblanc.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Montblanc, leader of Clan Centurio]]
A resident clan based in Rabanastre, '''Clan Centurio''' was founded by the young moogle Montblanc.  The clan's charge is to fell dangerous beasts called Marks that pose a threat to the populace of Ivalice, although its true hidden purpose is to cultivate hunters strong enough to defeat the most powerful monster to ever set foot on Ivalice, Yiazmat, the Wyrm God.  Yiazmat had killed Montblanc's master several years ago, and ever since he has searched for a way to exact his revenge.

Clans are special groups in the world of Ivalice, formed by small alliances of hunters, that are aimed at hunting the most dangerous monsters, or Marks, that are posted as threats to the lives of the individuals of Ivalice. This is not done just out of a sense of honor- there's also considerable money to be had. It can be thought of as specialized [[bounty hunting]]. This is the ordinary business of clans, but they also sometimes hunt special Marks called Elite Marks, more powerful beasts-with correspondingly larger bounties. 

Initially, there were only two major Clans in Ivalice; Clan Centurio is slowly progressing in the ranks, gaining popularity across Ivalice, and is the only real competitor with either of the larger two Clans. Clan Centurio is the only clan the player interacts with, and is the clan Vaan joins at the start of the game.

Notable members:

====Montblanc====
'''Montblanc''' is the leader of Clan Centurio, who is responsible for supervising Vaan's clan hunt progress. Appeared in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' as a playable character. He also seems to have a wide affiliation with other guilds and organizations around Ivalice, such as his sister Gurdy, who runs the Chocobo stables of the world. It is his desire to not only see Clan Centurio as the most prestigious of all clans, but to avenge his master's death at the hands of Yiazmat. He is one of the six Moogle siblings, the others being Nono, Gurdy, Hurdy, Horne, and Sorbet.

====Monid====
'''Monid''' is a Bangaa clan member of high rank. He is initially dismissive of Vaan, who he views as a weak hunter. Cantankerous at first, this clashes oddly with his habit of talking to a small Hume child in the clan hall. It is revealed that the child is the son of Monid's hunter friends, killed by the "Trickster" Mark, to whom their deaths he promises to avenge. Monid is also responsible for helping Montblanc set the hunter stalker bait by using the "Belito" Mark. After these two Mark hunts were pulled off successfully with Vaan's aid, Monid came to respect him as one of the best hunters in the clan.

====Krjn====
'''Krjn''' is a Viera who is also one of the founding members. Aided Vaan's clan hunt for the "Carrot" Mark. She is the sister of Ktjn, a Viera who can be aided in various ways in the city of Rabanastre. Her sister regards her as cold, and strong, though Krjn herself makes no note of this.

====Bansat====
'''Bansat''' is a Seeq member who aided Vaan's clan hunt for the "Gil Snapper" Mark. A jolly fellow, he readily recognizes Vaan as "tougher than me!" when Vaan reaches a high enough Clan Rank.

====Ma'kenroh====
'''Ma'kenroh''' is a Nu Mou who is also one of the founding members. He offers advice on hunts, but unlike other members, he does not participate in battle; other clan members mention this, stating that he uses other talents to aid Montblanc. He and Montblanc are old friends, explaining his presence in the Clan Hall. Incidentally, he is the only Nu Mou in all of Rabanastre.

====Tomaj====
'''Tomaj''' is the Hume owner of the Sandsea Tavern and Vaan's friend, he was the man who gave Vaan the bounty on the "Rogue Tomato" Mark and told him the basics of the Hunter. He is a member of Clan Centurio, although he is not seen in the Clan Hall. He returns in ''Revenant Wings'' as an ally. Tomaj is voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].

===Espers===
Entities created by the gods during the Great Making of the world. They were blessed with great intellect and strength, far beyond that of man. In time, this power made them proud and eventually Ultima announced her rebellion, so they rose up against their creators. Despite their immense power, they were stricken down in defeat and were banished to the world of men to remain eternally bound.
