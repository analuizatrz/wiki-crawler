'''Thomas Carmichael Hindman, Jr.''' ([[January 28]], [[1828]] &ndash; [[September 27]], [[1868]]) was a [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] from the [[Arkansas's 1st congressional district|1st Congressional District]] of [[Arkansas]] in the [[36th United States Congress]] from [[1859]] to [[1861]] and a [[Major General]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="Bioguide">{{cite web

After receiving his primary education in Ripley, he attended the [[Lawrenceville School|Lawrenceville Classical Institute]] (now known as the Lawrenceville School) and graduated with honors on [[September 25]], [[1843]]. Afterwards, he raised a [[company (military unit)|company]] in [[Tippah County, Mississippi|Tippah County]] for the 2nd [[Mississippi]]  regiment in the [[Mexican-American War]]. Hindman served the war as a [[lieutenant]] and later as a [[Captain#Military|captain]] of his company. After the war, he returned to Ripley. He studied [[law]], and was admitted into the state bar in [[1851]]. He then commenced his law practice in Ripley, but moved it to [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] two years later. 

Hindman then served as a member of the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] from [[1854]] to [[1856]]. He was elected and served as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] representative for Arkansas's 1st congressional district in the [[36th United States Congress|Thirty-sixth Congress]] from [[March 4]], [[1859]] to [[March 3]], [[1861]]. He was re-elected to the [[37th United States Congress|Thirty-seventh Congress]] but declined to serve at the onset of the [[American Civil War]]. He raised and commanded "Hindman's legion" in [[1861]] for the [[Confederate States Army]]. He was promoted to [[brigadier general]] on [[September 28]], [[1861]] and later [[Major General]] on [[April 18]], [[1862]]. After the war, he moved to [[Mexico City]] to pursue a literary career, but promptly returned back to Helena after the execution of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Neal | first=Diane | title=The Lion of the South: General Thomas C.

==Family background==
Thomas C. Hindman was born in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], as the fifth of the six children of Thomas Hindman and Sallie Holt Hindman. His parents came from an English and Scottish ancestral background.<ref name="p1">Neal (1997), p1.</ref> His mother's ancestors included Major Robert Holt, a successful planter and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses in [[1655]]. The Holt family originally came from [[Halifax County, Virginia]] before moving to Knoxville. Hindman's paternal lineage started with the Carmichael clan in [[Scotland]], and made its way into America after [[George II of Great Britain|King George II of Great Britain]] ousted nine hundred Scottish followers of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charles]] to America after the [[April 16]], [[1746]] [[Battle of Culloden]].<ref name="p1"/> One of the descendants of the Carmichael clan, Sarah Carmichael, married Samuel Hindman, a wealthy [[Pennsylvania]] merchant in the early 1790s. They then moved to Knoxville, and their youngest son Thomas C. Hindman, Sr. was born on [[November 10]], [[1793]]. Family legend claims that Hindman, Sr. was the first white male child born in Knoxville.<ref name="CV">{{cite journal |last=Hindman |first=Biscoe |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1930 |month=March |title=Thomas Carmichael Hindman |journal=Confederate Veteran |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=97 |id= |url= |accessdate=2007-05-31 |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Brown | first=P.

Hindman, Sr. was an [[ensign]] in the [[39th United States Infantry]] during the [[War of 1812]]. He was promoted to third lieutenant on [[January 11]], [[1814]] and to second lieutenant on May 20 of the same year. He fought in the [[Battle of New Orleans]], the final major battle of the war, and served in active duty until he resigned on [[June 30]], [[1816]] due to health concerns.<ref name="CV"/><ref>{{cite book | last=Powell | first=William H. |coauthors= |title=List of Officers of the Army of the United States from 1779 to 1900| publisher=L.

==Early life==
The elder Hindman frequently made business trips to [[Alabama]], and even moved the family to [[Jacksonville, Alabama|Jacksonville]] after buying several lots of land there. Hindman took advantage of the many business opportunities in the area, and he was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. Hindman, Sr. gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included [[Cherokee|Cherokee Indian]] tribes in the area.<ref name="p3">Neal (1997), p3.</ref> He became trusted by the [[Cherokee Nation]] and was appointed a sub-agent to the Cherokees by [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Monroe]]. When President [[Andrew Jackson]] was in office, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for the Cherokee Nation.<ref>Elizabeth Pack to Major General Thomas C. Hindman, [[December 15]] [[1862]], Thomas C. Hindman Collection, [[Phillips County, Arkansas|Phillips County]] Museum, [[Helena, Arkansas]].</ref> The elder Hindman frequently traveled to [[Washington D.C.]] to discuss the interests of the Cherokee Nation, and in [[1841]], he was assigned by Acting [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] Albert M. Lea to determine why the Cherokees in [[North Carolina]] had rejected the government's suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory.<ref name="p3"/> Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to "rejoin the nation in the West".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Finger |first=John R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1981 |month=May |title=The Abortive Second Cherokee Removal, 1841-1844 |journal=Journal of Southern History |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=211-215|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

That year, Hindman's father purchased a new plantation in [[Ripley, Mississippi]]. Hindman went to local schools, before going to study at the [[Lawrenceville Classical Institute]] in [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey]], which was the third oldest boarding school in the country.<ref>Neal (1997), p4.</ref><ref>{{cite web

Hindman's father became an active participant in Mississippi politics. He led the state's Whig Party, and served as a member of the executive committee of the local [[Henry Clay]] club. In [[1845]], he was selected as a delegate to attend a convention in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] that promoted transportation and infrastructural projects in the South and West.<ref>Ripley, Mississippi ''Advertiser'', 2, [[March 30]] [[1844]]; [[November 1]] [[1845]].</ref> Soon, the United States Army engaged in fighting at the US-Mexico border. After skirmishes along the [[Rio Grande]] between Mexican forces and American forces led by [[General]] [[Zachary Taylor]], Congress approved a declaration of war and President [[James K. Polk]] called upon the states to draw up 50,000 volunteers to be alongside the army. Mississippi newspapers encouraged state residents to join the action. As the [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] ''Guard'' proclaimed, "To arms! To arms! Ye brave! Th' avenging sword unsheathe: March on, march on, all hearts resolved, on [to] victory or death".<ref>[[Holly Springs, Mississippi]] ''Guard'', 8, [[May 29]] [[1846]].</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Brent |first=Robert A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1969 |month=August |title=Mississippi and the Mexican War |journal=Journal of Mississippi History |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=204-205|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> 

Hindman was eager to have the chance of serving his country in war. He enlisted as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in [[company (military)|company]] E of the Second Mississippi Infantry.<ref>Military Service Record of Thomas C. Hindman, Jr., [[National Archives and Records Administration]], [[Washington D.C.]]</ref> His older brother, Robert, also joined the same unit as a private.<ref name="Robert">Military Service Record of Robert H. Hindman, [[National Archives and Records Administration]], [[Washington D.C.]]</ref> Hindman and his fellow infantrymen spent the winter training for battle in Camp McClung. Many soldiers were unprepared for the cold temperatures in January 1847, and as a result, many died of [[influenza]], [[pneumonia]] and "the cold plague".<ref>{{cite book | last= | first= |editors=Reuben Davis| title=Recollections of Mississippi and Mississippians | publisher= University of Mississippi Press| location=Oxford, Mississippi | year = 1972|isbn= | pages=p253 }}</ref> The Second Mississippi Infantry headed off towards the [[United States–Mexico border]] in February. They reached the mouth of the [[Rio Grande]] on [[February 24]], [[1847]], just a day after the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. They continued marching, and the number of dead soldiers escalated. By June 1847, 167 men had died, 134 had been discharged and 38 had been deserted.<ref>{{cite book | last=Rowland | first=Dunbar | title=Military History of Mississippi, 1803-1898 | publisher= The Reprint Company| location=Spartanburg, South Carolina | year = 1988|isbn=| pages=p30-31 }}</ref> The infantry later moved to Buena Vista, seven miles south of [[Saltillo, Coahuila]], for guard duty. The anticipation of glory for the regiment evaporated amongst the ravages of disease, guerilla raids, and camp duties. In March 1847, Colonel Charles Clark assigned Hindman the position of appointment as the acting regiment’s adjutant, due to his educational background and writing skills.<ref>Neal (1997), p11.</ref> Hindman's brother, Robert, who was now a sergeant, suffered from smallpox and was medically discharged on April 23.<ref name="Robert"/> Hindman rose to the rank of [[lieutenant]] and Post Adjutant by the end of the war in [[1848]], but did not see any major action during the remainder of his time with the infantry.<ref>Neal (1997), p13.</ref>

After returning back to Ripley, Hindman continued his law studies under Orlando Davis. A year after the war ended, Hindman's brother, Robert, engaged in a fight with William Falkner because he had thought Falkner tried to block his membership into the Ripley section of the [[Sons of Temperance]]. Robert Hindman tried to defend himself, but his gun failed to fire, and Falkner then fatally stabbed him. Falkner was tried for murder, but was acquitted by the jury ruling that he was acting in self-defense.<ref>The State of Mississippi vs. William C. Falkner, Circuit Court, Tippah County Courthouse, Ripley Mississippi.</ref> Afterwards, Falkner killed a family friend of the Hindmans, and he again was acquitted in the murder trial.<ref>Letter by C. J. Frederick, Falkner's law partner, to the Memphis ''Daily Appeal'', [[April 20]] [[1881]].</ref> Thomas Hindman and Falkner engaged in a gun fight, but neither man was injured. The tense relationship between Falkner and Hindman culminated in a settlement made by Matthew C. Galloway, who would later become the future editor of the [[Memphis, Tennesse]] ''Appeal''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoar |first=Victor |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1955 |month=February |title=Colonel William C.

He would leave the group when he moved to [[Arkansas]] on [[March 18]], [[1854]].<ref>[[Sons of Temperance]], Minutes, Term Ending March 31 1854, Item 64.</ref>

== Mississippi politics ==
After the war Hindman became active in the [[Sons of Temperance]] movement and became the recording secretary of the local branch. In [[1853]] he successfully campaigned for a seat in the Mississippi legislature and was deeply involved in [[Mississippi]] politics. By the end of [[1854]] Hindman realized that he had little room to maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the river, Hindman realized that the young and turbulent State of [[Arkansas]] was wide open for a well educated and ambitious politician. He traveled to [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], in [[Phillips County, Arkansas]] and found it well suited for his purposes.  

== Move to Arkansas ==
Hindman threw himself into the political and social scenes in his new home. He catapulted himself into the fray by taking a stand against the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic [[Know-Nothing movement|Know-Nothings]], whom he considered "pestilent fanatics". Hindman and his [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] law partner established a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] association designed to stamp out the Know-Nothing threat. During this time Hindman became close friends with [[Patrick Cleburne]], who would later parallel his course as a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[major general]]. Cleburne and Hindman were both wounded during a street fight in Helena with Know-Nothing members. Hindman received praise for his actions and became a force in Democratic politics after the Know-Nothings were defeated.    

In [[1856]] Hindman ran for the Congressional seat in his First District but was defeated by the incumbent. His gracious withdrawal at the convention to avoid Democratic infighting earned him more notice from the party hierarchy.

During this time Hindman met and courted Mary "Mollie" Watkins Biscoe.  Despite her parents' reluctance, the two were married on [[November 11]], [[1856]], with [[Patrick Cleburne]] serving as best man.

In [[1857]] Hindman became editor of the [[Helena States-Rights Democrat]] and was the unchallenged leader of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in eastern Arkansas. From this platform he launched his [[1858]] Congressional bid and faced no serious challenge.

During his term Hindman turned on the political hierarchy in the state and political warfare divided the Democratic Party in Arkansas with the pro-Hindman forces on one side and the forces of the political "family" that had ruled Arkansas since territorial days on the other. At the end of the [[1860]] elections the power of "the family" had been smashed by Hindman.

== The Civil War ==
As the [[American Civil War]] approached, Hindman was an ardent voice for secession and was essentially Arkansas's most prominent [[Fire-Eaters|Fire-Eater]]. When Arkansas seceded from the [[Union (ACW)|Union]] in May of 1861, Hindman was present in the gallery of the convention.

With war approaching, Hindman recruited a regiment at Helena, which was mustered into Confederate service. He and his regiment were soon active participants in the disastrous Kentucky Campaign, followed soon thereafter by fierce fighting at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], where he was slightly wounded.

After his recovery, Hindman was appointed commander of the [[Trans-Mississippi District]]. Events in Arkansas had taken a terrible turn for the worst. Most units had been stripped from the state for service east of the [[Mississippi River]]. When Hindman arrived in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], he found that he had almost nothing with which to defend the state from the Federal Army that was approaching dangerously from the northwest.

Hindman set to work and issued a series of harsh military edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerilla warfare, and requisitioning supplies for the defense of the State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted [[Texas]] troops bound for Virginia for use in the defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear that they did not have an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line. Hindman's harsh actions had essentially saved Little Rock for another year.

Hindman's edicts, however, raised the ire of the local citizenry and they, and Hindman's political enemies, demanded that [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] replace him. By August of [[1862]], the authorities in Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent [[Theophilus H. Holmes]].

Hindman convinced Holmes to give him a field command in northern Arkansas and he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader.  Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. But at this moment Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at [[Prairie Grove, Arkansas]], allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.

Hindman's position was well selected, but the better equipped and supplied Federal forces wore down the Confederate forces and Hindman was forced to withdraw back towards Little Rock, having missed his chance to destroy the Federal army.

After the stalemate at Prairie Grove, Hindman was transferred back across the river and participated in the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] alongside his friend Pat Cleburne. He continued to fight along with the [[Confederate Army of Tennessee|Army of Tennessee]] against General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in the [[Atlanta Campaign]], across north Georgia from the [[Battle of Dalton]] to the [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain]], just outside [[Marietta, Georgia]]. At Kennesaw Mountain he was struck in the eye by a tree limb and took a leave of absence. He set out for Texas and was there when the Confederacy fell. Along with many other now ex-Confederates he crossed the [[Rio Grande]] into [[Mexico]] and sought asylum. He worked there as a coffee planter.

== Post War activities ==
By April [[1867]], Hindman was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] for a pardon. Hindman's application was one of the few denied. Nonetheless, Hindman attempted to return to his former life.

Politics still called to him and, although ineligible to run for office, he came out against the [[Reconstruction]] Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a [[treason]] indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.

== Assassination ==
On the night of [[September 27]] [[1868]], Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his newspaper. His children were present in the room when he was shot in the neck, face, chest, and hands.

Hindman lived long enough to give a farewell speech to supporters from the porch of his house before collapsing from blood loss the following morning. The murderers were never caught and many theories on their identities circulated for many years, owing to his having many enemies.

Hindman is buried at Maple Hill Cemetery in [[Helena, Arkansas]], near his friend [[Patrick Cleburne]].
