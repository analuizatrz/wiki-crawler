'''Publius Sempronius C.f. Tuditanus''' was a Roman Republican consul and censor, best known for leading about 600 men to safety at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]] in [[August]], [[216 BC]].

==Tuditanus at Cannae==
The consul [[Aemilius Paullus]] (who died at Cannae) had left a reserve camp of about 10,000 men on the other bank.  These men who did not participate in the battle had three choices after the disastrous battle: surrender to Hannibal,  attempt to break through the Carthaginian lines and escape, or stand their ground and die fighting

One of their officers, Publius Sempronius Tuditanus advised that the men put on their shields, form a shield-wall, and break out through the lines of the exhausted Carthaginian army. Very few men agreed to go with him, the rest deciding to surrender to Hannibal and trusting that they would be ransomed by the Senate.  About 600 men thus broke out through the surprised Carthaginian army and were led to safety by Tuditanus, whose reputation was thus made with the Senate and the people of Rome. (The Senate refused to ransom those who had surrendered to Hannibal or been captured alive on the field of battle, with a senior senator [[Manlius Torquatus|Titus Manlius Torquatus]] citing the example of Tuditanus and his group, compared to the cowardly men who had not dared break out).

==Tuditanus in politics==
In 208 BC, when Tuditanus was not yet a consul, he was elected [[Roman censor|censor]] with [[Marcus Cornelius Cethegus]] (also not yet a consul).  These two young censors managed to complete the first ''[[lustrum]]'' (ritual cleansing) of the Roman state since the start of the Second Punic War. Other lustrums had been interrupted by the death of at least one censor (sometimes in battle).  

It was Tuditanus who had the right of choosing the new [[Princeps Senatus]]; Cethegus wanted the most senior censor, namely [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (235 BC)|Titus Manlius Torquatus]], to be chosen since he had been censor in 231 BC. However, Tuditanus preferred [[Quintus Fabius Maximus]], the "Delayer", who had been elected censor in 230 BC, and was thus "junior", to be Princeps Senatus since he was the most meritorious of the senior senators. Since Tuditanus had the right to choose, his decision prevailed.

In 203 BC, Tuditanus became [[Consul|consul]], again with his former co-censor Cethegus. It is not known how well the men worked together again, although Livy does not mention any unseemly fracas.

==Family==
Tuditanus may have been a nephew or cousin of [[Marcus Sempronius C.f. Tuditanus]] who had been consul in 240 BC and censor in 230 BC); his own father's name was Gaius (or Caius) according to lists of Roman consuls.  The Sempronia Tuditani, who was mother of [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] (one of Caesar's generals and assassins), may have been one of his descendants.
