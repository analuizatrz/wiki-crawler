'''The Dow Chemical Company''' ({{nyse|DOW}} {{tyo|4850}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Midland, Michigan]].  As of 2007, it is the second largest chemical manufacturer in the world (after [[BASF]]).<ref>[http://www.hoovers.com/Dow%20Chemical/--ID__10471--/freeuk-co-factsheet.xhtml]</ref> 

Dow Chemical is a provider of plastics, chemicals, and agricultural products with presence in more than 175 countries and employing 43,000 people worldwide. It spends more than $1 billion annual expenditure in R&D. Its stated mission under the current CEO, [[Andrew N. Liveris]], is:
:"To constantly improve what is essential to human progress by mastering science and technology" with the vision: "to be the largest, most profitable, and most respected chemical company in the world".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dow.com/about/aboutdow/vision.htm|title=Dow's vision statement|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>

The company was founded in 1897 by Canadian-born chemist [[Herbert Henry Dow]], who had invented a new method of extracting the [[bromine]] that was trapped underground in [[brine]] at Midland, Michigan.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/45.html | title=Hall of Fame Inventor Profile | publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref> While at first the company sold only [[bleach]] and [[potassium bromide]], Dow today has seven major operating segments, with a wide variety of products offered by each.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/about/aboutdow/profile/CorpProfile2006.pdf | title=Corporate Profile | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref> The company's 2005 sales totaled [[United States dollar|$]]46.3 billion, with a net income of $4.5 billion. Traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as of 2005 Dow has about 105,000 shareholders.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.dow.com/dow_news/press/pre_fast.htm | title=Fast Facts | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref>

Dow has been called the "Chemical companies' Chemical company"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=il&vol=app/2005/1031657&invol|title=Quote from John Tysse, Dow vice-president of sales and marketing|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref> in that most of their product is sold to other manufacturers rather than to end users.  Dow had periods of selling into the Human and Animal Health markets as well as into the Consumer Products market (the latter most visible with [[Saran Wrap]]), but all of these facilities have been sold over the years.

Dow Chemical is an active member of the [[American Chemistry Council]], and an active partner in different programs and initiatives in both the [[World Bank]] and [[United Nations]].

== Products ==
Dow is the world's largest producer of [[plastic]]s, including [[polystyrene]], [[polyurethane]]s, [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], and synthetic [[rubber]]s.  It is also a major producer of the chemicals [[calcium chloride]], [[ethylene oxide]], and various [[acrylate]]s, [[surfactant]]s, and [[cellulose]] resins.  It produces many agricultural chemicals, perhaps being most famous for its [[pesticide]] [[Lorsban]].<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/about/aboutdow/profile/CorpProfile2006.pdf | title=Corporate Profile | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref>  Its most well-known [[consumer products]] include [[Styrofoam|Styrofoam brand insulation]]. Former Dow product lines, [[Saran (plastic)|Saran]] wrap and [[Ziploc]] bags, Scrubbing Bubbles have been sold to [[S. C. Johnson & Son]].

===Performance plastics===

Performance Plastics make up 25% of Dow's sales<ref>''Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>, with many products designed for the [[automotive industry|automotive]] and [[construction industry|construction industries]].  The [[plastic]]s include [[polyolefin]]s such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]], as well as the [[polystyrene]] most often seen in [[Styrofoam]]<sup>[[Trademark|TM]]</sup> insulating material.  A complete range of [[epoxy]] resin intermediates and products are manufactured by Dow, including [[bisphenol A]] and [[epichlorohydrin]].  [[Polyurethane]], polyether polyols and specialty [[acrylate]]s are all derived from [[ethylene oxide]] (EO).  The [[Saran]]<sup>TM</sup> range of resins and films is based on [[polyvinylidene chloride]] (PVDC).

===Performance chemicals===

The Performance Chemicals (17% of sales) segment produces materials for [[water purification]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, paper [[coating]]s, paints and advanced [[electronics industry|electronics]].  Major product lines include nitroparaffins such as [[nitromethane]], used in the pharmaceutical industry and manufactured by ANGUS Chemical Company <ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/angus/ | title=ANGUS Chemical Company | publisher= The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 26, 2006}}</ref>, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company.

The Hydrocarbons and Energy operating segment (13% of sales) oversees energy management at Dow, succeeding in raising energy efficiency by 92% since 1990.<ref>''Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>  Fuels and oil-based raw materials are also procured.  Major feedstocks for Dow are provided by this group, including [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], [[1,3-butadiene]], [[benzene]] and [[styrene]].

== History ==
'''Early history'''

The company originally sold only [[bleach]] and [[potassium bromide]], achieving a daily bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902. Early in the company's existence, a group of [[Economy of the United Kingdom|British]] manufacturers attempted to drive Dow out of the bleach business by cutting prices. Dow survived by cutting prices in response and, although losing about $90,000 in income, began to diversify its [[product line]].<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.geo.msu.edu/geo333/dow.html | title=Dow Chemical | publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Department of Geography | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref> In 1905 German bromide producers drastically reduced their price of bromides in the US in an effort to prevent Dow from expanding its sales of bromides in Europe. Dow was able to purchase German-made bromides in the US, ship them back to Europe and still sell them at a lower price than the German producers were charging. <ref>{{cite book |last=Brandt |first=E.N.|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Growth Company: Dow Chemical's First Century |year=1997 |publisher=Michigan State University Press |location=East Lansing, MI |isbn=0-87013-426-4 }}</ref> Even in its early history, the company set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its [[product line]].  Within twenty years, Dow had become a major producer of [[agricultural]] chemicals, elemental [[chlorine]], [[phenol]] and other [[dye]]stuffs, and [[magnesium]] metal.

'''Diversification into plastics'''

In the 1930s, Dow began production of plastic resins, which would grow to become one of the corporation's major businesses.  Its first plastic products were [[ethylcellulose]], made in 1935, and [[polystyrene]], made in 1937.

'''WW II - Magnesium and the beginnings of geographic diversification'''

In 1940-1, Dow built its first plant to produce [[magnesium]] extracted from [[seawater]] rather than underground brine. This marked the first time man had 'mined the ocean for metal'.[http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm] 

Growth of this business made Dow a strategically important business during [[World War II]], as magnesium became important in fabricating lightweight parts for [[aircraft]].  Also during the war, Dow and [[Corning Glass Works|Corning]] began their joint venture, [[Dow Corning]], to produce [[silicone]]s for military and later civilian use. In 1942 Dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of Dow Chemical of Canada in [[Sarnia, Ontario]] to produce [[styrene]] for use in [[styrene-butadiene]] [[synthetic rubber]].

'''Freeport - Texas Operations'''

In 1940, Dow began plant construction in Freeport, Texas. This is now the home to Dow's largest site - and one of the largest integrated chemical manufacturing sites in the world. One of the first plants to come on stream was the first facility to extract magnesium from seawater. The site grew quickly - with power, chlorine, caustic soda and ethylene also soon in production.  [http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/history.htm]

Based on 2002-2003 data, the Freeport plants (known as Texas Operations internally) produced 27 billion pounds of product - or 21% of Dow's global production. [http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/texops/about/facts.htm]

'''Post WW II'''

In the post-war era, Dow began expanding outside North America, founding its first overseas subsidiary in [[Economy of Japan|Japan]] in 1952, with several other nations following rapidly thereafter.  Based largely on its growing plastics business, it opened a consumer products division beginning with Saran wrap in 1953.  Based on its growing chemicals and plastics businesses, Dow's sales exceeded $1 billion in 1964, $2 billion in 1971, and $10 billion in 1980.

'''The 1990's - transition from geographic alignment to global business units'''

In the early 1990s, Dow embarked on a major structural reorganization. The former reporting hierarchy was geographic based, with the regional president reporting directly to the overall company President and CEO. The new organization groups together the same businesses from different sites, irrespective of which region they belong (i.e. the vice president for Polystyrene is now in charge of these plants all over the word), almost reducing the regional president to a figurehead.  

[[William S. Stavropoulos|Bill Stavropoulos]] served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1995-2000 and again from 2002-2004. He relinquished his board seat on April 1, 2006, having been a director since 1990 and chairman since 2000. During his first tenure, he led the purchase of [[Union Carbide]] which had proven controversial, as it was initially blamed for poor results under his successor as CEO Mike Parker. Parker was dismissed and Stavropoulos returned from retirement to lead a turnaround of Dow.[http://news.dow.com/corporate/2005/20051213a.htm]

Today, Dow is the world's largest producer of plastics; with its 2001 acquisition of [[Union Carbide]], it has become a major player in the [[petrochemical]] industry as well.

On [[August 31]], [[2006]] Dow announced that it had plans to close facilities at three locations:<ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.dow.com/dow_news/corporate/2006/20060831g.htm | title=Dow Announces Plant Closures To Strengthen Competitive Position | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | date=August 31, 2006 | accessed=September 13, 2006}}</ref>
*It will shut down all of its production in [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]], [[Ontario]] by the end of 2008. Sarnia had been Dow's first manufacturing site in Canada. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for [[World War II]]). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. Up to the early 1990s, the Chemical Valley site contained numerous plants, while Dow Canada's headquarters were located at the [[Highway 40 (Ontario)|Modeland Centre]], and a new River Centre complex was opened which housed Research and Development. Since then, several plants on the site have been dismantled and Dow Canada headquarters were moved to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], while the Dow Fitness Centre was donated to YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia. In 2000, Sarnia Site was the location of a pilot plant for ethylene-styrene interpolymer (ESI) but ending up production never progressed and the project was ended. In 2002, the old steam plant was demolished and land on the site was sold to [[TransAlta]] which built a new natural gas power plant. As of 2003, the remaining plants on the site produce Polystyrene, Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Epoxy Resins, Polyols (Propylene Oxide Derivatives), and Latexes.[http://www.dow.com/publicreport/2003/local/sarnia/letter.htm]
*One plant (Dow terminology for a production unit) at its site in [[Porto Marghera (Venice)]], [[Italy]], which had been shut down for planned maintenance earlier that month, will not be restarted.
*Two plants at its major site in [[Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta|Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] were to be shut down by the end of October 2006.

==Environmental Record==

Based on year 2000 data,<ref>[http://www.peri.umass.edu/Technical-Notes.264.0.html Political Economy Research Institute Toxic 100 Corporate Toxics Information Project Technical Notes retrieved 12 Nov 2007</ref> researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute determined that Dow Chemical was ranked eleventh among corporations in a measure of toxicity of airborne pollutants emitted in the United States, releasing more than 14 million pounds of toxins into American air in that year. (The statistics given are not correlated to the volume of production.) <ref>[http://www.peri.umass.edu/Toxic-100-Table.265.0.html Political Economy Research Institute]</ref> According to [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) documents Dow has some responsibility for 96 of the United States' worst [[Superfund]] [[toxic waste]] dumps, in tenth place by number of sites. One of these, a mining site, is listed as the sole responsibility of Dow: all the rest are shared with numerous other companies. Fifteen sites have been listed by the EPA as finalized (cleaned up) and 69 are listed as "construction complete", meaning that all required plans and equipment for cleanup are in place.<ref>[http://www.publicintegrity.org/superfund/Company.aspx?act=10312 Center for Public Integrity]</ref>
====Union Carbide Bhopal disaster====
{{main article|Bhopal disaster}}
In 1984, a chemical factory operated by [[Union Carbide]], an American company, leaked 40 tonnes of lethal [[methyl isocyanate]] (MIC) gas into the surrounding environment, which has caused more than 20,000 deaths and 100,000 disabilities.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

In 1991, The Supreme Court of India upheld a US $470 million civil settlement. The court required the Indian government to use the money to fund a group medical plan for up to 100,000 persons who might develop symptoms at a later date, and dismissed all petitions challenging the settlement. In 1994, Union Carbide sold its interest in Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL).[http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm] 

In 1999, Dow purchased Union Carbide, which is now a [[wholly owned subsidiary]]. Dow denies legal liability for the disaster, since it did not own or operate the Bhopal factory. Because of this disaster, there are thousands of people who are sick today and have been dying.  <ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2698000/2698709.stm | title=On This Day: December 3, 1984 | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bhopal/4023447.stm | title=Response: Union Carbide and Dow Chemical  | date=November 25, 2004 | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

====Dioxins in Michigan====
Starting in the early 2000s, residents living along the [[Tittabawassee River]] near the company's headquarters in Midland and nearby [[Saginaw County, Michigan|Saginaw]] counties in [[Michigan]] filed a class-action lawsuit against the company for [[dioxin]] contamination (levels of dioxins were found above those allowed by the Department of Environmental Quality) in the soil on the riverbed and along its shores.  As of June 2005, the case is still awaiting class certification. [http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0418-31.htm]
====Chlorpyrifos====
[[Chlorpyrifos]], marketed by Dow as Dursban, is well known as a home and garden [[insecticide]], and until 2000 it was one of the most widely used household [[pesticide]] in the US.  The pesticide is also a nerve toxin and suspected [[endocrine disruptor]] and has been associated with [[carcinogenicity]], reproductive and developmental [[toxicity]], and [[acute toxicity]]. One study claims that Dow has contributed to 80% of the Chlorpyrifos burden of the US.

In 1995, Dow was fined $732,000 for not sending the EPA reports it had received on 249 Dursban poisoning incidents. In June 2000, Dow withdrew registration of chlorpyrifos for use in homes and other places where children could be exposed, and severely restricted its use on crops. The company, however, continues to market Dursban in industrializing countries, including India, where Dow's sales literature claimed Dursban has "an established record of safety regarding humans and pets."

In 2003, Dow agreed to pay $2 million - the largest penalty ever in a pesticide case - to the state of New York, in response to a lawsuit filed by the Attorney General to end Dow's illegal advertising of Dursban as "safe".

====Energy Conservation====
On 2007, Dow was awarded an American Chemical Council (ACC) award of 'Exceptional Merit' in recognition of its longstanding energy efficiency and conservation efforts. Between 1995 and 2005, Dow reduced energy intensity (BTU per pound produced) by 22%. This is equivalent to saving enough electricity to power eight million US homes for a year. [http://www.csrwire.com/News/8515.html]

====Environmental Awards====
In 2007, Dow subsidiary Dow Agrosciences won an United Nations Montreal Protocol Innovators Award for its efforts in helping replace methyl bromide - a compound identified as contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. In addition, Dow Agrosciences won an EPA "Best of the Best" Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award. [http://www.seedtoday.com/articles/Dow_Agrosciences_Wins_UN_Award_for_Methyl_Bromide_Alternative-48678.html]

==Human rights controversies==
====Breast implants====
A major manufacturer of silicone [[breast implants]], Dow Corning was successfully sued in 1977 for damages arising from a woman whose implants ruptured; it was the first such successful suit, and Dow Corning paid $170,000 in a settlement. During the 1980s, [[Ralph Nader]]'s [[Public Citizen]] Health Research Group publicised its belief that the implants were cancer-causing; in December of 1990, an episode of ''Face to Face with [[Connie Chung]]'' addressed the then-alleged dangers of silicone implants. More lawsuits, as well as [[Food and Drug Administration]] reviews, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] hearings, and scientific studies took place in the ensuing years; as of December 1991, 137 individual lawsuits were filed against Dow Corning, a figure that would rise to 3,558 in December 1992, and 19,092 by December 1994. Amidst the flurry of lawsuits in May 1995, Dow Corning filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection; several judgments against Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were handed down in lawsuits.

Several panels of independent experts, including the [[Institute of Medicine]], have since found that silicone breast implants do not appear to cause any systemic diseases or cancers. <ref name = nyt> [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9B03E6D9103BF932A15755C0A96F958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fI%2fInstitute%20of%20Medicine  "Panel Confirms No Major Illness Tied to Implants"] (June 21, 1999), ''The New York Times'' </ref> <ref name = frontline> [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/implants/cron.html Chronology of silicone breast implants]. ''Frontline''</ref>

====Napalm====
During the [[Vietnam War]], Dow became the sole supplier of [[napalm]] to the [[United States military]]. Napalm, an [[incendiary]] liquid used as a weapon in Vietnam, led to human casualties that were widely displayed in the news media. Protests of Dow took place at many colleges but Dow's board of directors voted to continue production of napalm (after attempting to persuade the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] to accept responsibility for napalm and exculpate Dow's management).

====Agent Orange====
[[Agent Orange]], a chemical [[defoliant]] containing [[dioxin]], was also manufactured by Dow for use by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War; the dioxin from the defoliant made its way into the [[food chain]] and was linked to a major increase in [[birth defects]] among Vietnamese people. In 2005, a lawsuit was filed by Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange against Dow and [[Monsanto]], which also supplied Agent Orange to the military. The companies argued that no link between Agent Orange and the alleged health problems had been proven, and furthermore that the companies are not responsible for the manner in which their products are used by the military.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4305287.stm | title= Agent Orange lawsuit opens in US | date=March 1, 2005 | publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref> The lawsuit was thrown out.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/122591.asp | title = US won't compensate Vietnam's Agent Orange victims: official | date=June 6, 2006 | publisher=Todayonline.com | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref> In 2006, a court in [[South Korea]] did order Dow and Monsanto to compensate [[military of South Korea|South Korean veterans]] of the Vietnam War and their families for Agent Orange-related injuries.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11037756/from/RSS/ | title=Court rules against U.S. firms on Agent Orange | date=January 26, 2006 | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref>

====DBCP====
Until the late 1970's Dow produced [[DBCP]] (1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane), a soil fumigant and [[nematicide]] sold under the names the Nemagon and Fumazone. Workers at Dow's DBCP production were made sterile by exposure to DBCP. These male reproductive effects were consistent with animal experiments showing that DBCP sterilized rabbits. The workers successfully sued the company, and most domestic uses of the chemical were banned in 1977. Amid growing concerns over DBCP's effects on male workers, Dow ceased production and reclaimed DBCP that had been shipped to its users. Despite warning from the company about its health effects, [[Dole Food Company]], who was using the chemical on its [[banana]] plantations in [[Latin America]], threatened to sue Dow if it stopped DCBP shipments, so Dow shipped half a million gallons of DBCP to Dole, much it reclaimed from other users. Plantation workers who became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued both Dow and Dole in Latin American courts, alleging that their ailments were caused by DCBP exposure. While the courts agreed with the workers and awarded them over $600 million in damages, they have been unable to collect payments from the companies. A group of workers then sued in the United States, and, on [[November 5]], [[2007]], a Los Angeles jury awarded them 3.2 million dollars. Dole and Dow vowed to appeal the decision.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-dole6nov06,1,2105565.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-california "Dole must pay farmworkers $3.2 million"], John Spano, ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 6th, 2007.</ref>

==Dow Corning==
{{main|Dow Corning}}
Equally owned by Dow and [[Corning, Inc.]] (formerly Corning Glass Works), Dow Corning was founded in 1943 by the two companies as a joint venture. The company's focus is [[silicon]]-based products and technology.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dowcorning.com/content/about/default.asp | title=About Dow Corning | publisher=Dow Corning | accessed=June 25, 2006}}</ref> Dow Corning in turn owns 63% of the [[Hemlock, Michigan]]-based [[Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation]], which manufactures [[polycrystalline silicon]] for [[semiconductor]] chips.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.ourmidland.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16832187&BRD=2289&PAG=461&dept_id=472542&rfi=6 | title=Governor visits HSC; expansion plans on schedule | author=Wade, Cheryl | date=June 24, 2006 | publisher=Midland Daily News | accessed=June 25, 2006}}</ref>

Dow Corning manufactured silicone [[breast implants]], which were the cause of controversy and legal liability in the 1980s and 1990s (''see [[Dow Chemical Company#Breast implants|below]]''.)
==Board of directors==
Current members of the [[board of directors]] of The Dow Chemical Company are [[Arnold Allemang]] (who is also a senior adviser to the company); chemistry professor [[Jacqueline Barton]]; former [[Boeing]] manager [[James A. Bell]]; [[Whirlpool Corporation]] chairman and CEO [[Jeff Fettig]]; former [[U.S. Secretary of Commerce]] [[Barbara Franklin]]; Dow chairman and CEO [[Andrew N. Liveris]]; Dow CFO [[Geoffery E. Merszei]]; Illinois Tool Works Inc. vice chairman [[James Ringler]]; [[Duke Energy Corporation]] president [[Ruth Shaw]]; and  Claris Capital chairman [[Paul Stern]] (who is Dow's presiding director and a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].)<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/corpgov/leader/stern.htm | title=Board of Directors | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 23, 2006}}</ref>
=== 2007 dismissals ===
On [[April 12]], [[2007]], Dow dismissed two senior executives for "unauthorized discussions with third parties about the potential sale of the company."  The two figures are executive vice president Romeo Kreinberg, and director and former [[Chief Financial Officer|CFO]] J. Pedro Reinhard.  Dow claims they were secretly in contact with [[J. P. Morgan]]; at the same time, a story surfaced in Britain's [[Sunday Express]] regarding a possible [[leveraged buyout]] of Dow. The two executives have since filed lawsuits claiming they were fired for being a threat to CEO Liveris, and that the allegations were concocted as a pretext.<ref>{{Citation | title ="Former Dow executives fight back" | newspaper =[[Chemical and Engineering News]] | pages =12 | year =2007 | date =May 14 | url =http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/85/i20/8520notw6.html }}</ref>

=== Major Sponsorships===
In September 2004, the company obtained the naming rights to the Saginaw County Event Center in [[Saginaw, Michigan]]; the center is now called the [[Dow Event Center]]. The [[Saginaw Spirit]] (of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]) plays at the Center, which also hosts events such as [[professional wrestling]] and live theater.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/michigan/outreach/eventcenter.htm | title=The Dow Event Center | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite website | url = http://www.doweventcenter.com/ | title=Welcome to the Dow Event Center | publisher=Dow Event Center | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref>

In October 2006 the company bought the naming rights to the stadium used by the Single-A [[Minor League baseball]] team located in its hometown of Midland, Michigan. The stadium (which opens in April 2007) is called [[Dow Diamond]]. The Dow Foundation played a key role in bringing the team, the [[Great Lakes Loons]], to the city.

The company also sponsors a global running relay to highlight the need for better drinking water in locations around the globe. The run will roughly follow the 41st North parallel and cover nearly {{convert|12000|mi|km}}. The run is organized by the Blue Planet Run Foundation.

==Outlook==

Dow CEO [[Andrew N. Liveris]] called 2005 the company's "best year ever" with operating profits of $5.4 billion, a jump of 56.5% compared with the previous year. <ref>"Top 50 Chemical Producers", ''Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 20 (May 15, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>  Net income rose more than 60% to $4.5 billion, on sales of $46.3 billion.  2006 looks as if it could be even better, with first-quarter net earnings of $1.2 billion. <ref name="liveris">''"Liveris Tells It Like It Is", Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>  All this is occurring in the context of adverse operating conditions, caused by high energy and raw material costs, and the effects of two damaging hurricanes.

Liveris supports the vertically integrated approach used at Dow, which produces everything from basic chemical feedstocks to high value products such as pesticides and reverse osmosis membranes.  These value-adding product chains, along with Dow's wide product range, help the company to weather the storms of the global economy.  Despite this, high energy and feedstock costs may begin to take their toll, particularly if global demand begins to fall just as supply is rising.

Like many chemical companies, Dow is facing pressures of regulation in the US and [[Economy of the European Union|Europe]], particularly as the [[European Union|EU]] introduces its new [[Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals|REACH]] policy.  Litigation costs in the US taken over by Dow as a result of its 2001 takeover of [[Union Carbide]] also remain a concern.  

For these reasons the company is looking to the Middle East and Asia for new projects.  In [[Kuwait]] , Dow is constructing (with [[Petrochemical Industries Company|PIC of Kuwait]]) a new world-scale [[petroleum cracking|ethane cracker]] for production of [[ethylene]], along with an [[ethylene oxide]]/[[ethylene glycol]] plant and (for 2008) a facility for production of [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.  In [[Oman]], the company is working with the Oman government to build a new world-scale [[polyethylene]] plant.  In China, the company is collaborating with [[Shenhua Group]] (the country's largest [[coal mining]] company) to improve [[catalyst]] efficiency to allow viable conversion of [[coal]] to [[alkene|olefin]]s.  Dow is also seeking to expand its [[Research and development|R&D]] presence in Asia, adding 600 jobs in [[Shanghai]] by the end of 2007, and the company may open up a large R&D center in India. 

The joint ventures planned for Asia are typical of Dow's "asset-light" approach, which works by offering a combination of intellectual property and money in exchange for a share in a world-scale production facility.  At the same time, the company is considering selling a share of some of its existing assets in order to free up cash.  

In June 2006 Liveris announced Dow's [[safety]] and [[environmentalism|environmental]] goals for 2015: <ref name="liveris"/>
* 75% reduction in environmental, health and safety indicators from 2005. The company aims to have no fatalities, and a reduction in injuries, spillages and leaks.
* 25% increase in [[energy efficiency]].
* 2.5% annual reduction in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions intensity.
Liveris expects these goals to be reached predominantly with [[fossil fuel]]s, through [[energy conservation]] and reduction of [[energy intensity]], as he does not expect [[alternative energy]] to play a major role for at least 10-20 years.

==The Human Element==
The [[Dow Chemical Company]] has from [[June 20]], [[2006]] run several [[ads|advertisements]] in a variety of media, starting with a [[video]] campaign and  under the theme "The Human Element", designed to increase the awareness of the human aspect of the company, to highlight ''its vision of addressing some of the most pressing economic, social and environmental concerns facing the global community in the coming decade''.<ref>{{cite website | url = http://news.dow.com/corporate/2006/20060619c.htm/ | title = Dow Chemical Launches "The Human Element"  Campaign | publisher = The Dow Chemical Company | accessed = 30 August, 2007}}</ref> The advertisements feature a [[human]] face with [[7E+09]] at the bottom.
