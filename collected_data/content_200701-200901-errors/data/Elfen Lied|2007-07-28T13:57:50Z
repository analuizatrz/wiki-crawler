{{Nihongo|'''''Elfen Lied '''''|エルフェンリート|Erufen Rīto}} is the title of a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series originally created by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[mangaka|author]] [[Lynn Okamoto]] as well as a TV [[anime]] series based on it.  ''Elfen Lied'' focuses on a mysterious and deadly breed of horned humans called "[[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|diclonius]]", and the havoc they wreak upon humanity. The title ''Elfen Lied'' is [[German language|German]] for "Elf Song" (see [[Lied]]), and pronounced approximately {{IPA|[ˈɛlfən liːd]}}, although the correct German spelling would be "Elfenlied". 

''Elfen Lied'' first began as a [[manga]] series, serialized in the magazine ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'' and published in Japan by [[Shueisha]], ending at the completion of the twelfth volume. An [[anime]] adaptation began airing in Japan on [[July 25]] [[2004]] while the unfinished manga was still in production. This caused the anime plot to differ in some ways from the manga plot. A bonus [[OVA]] episode was released on [[April 21]] [[2005]] giving some more [[back-story|background]] information. 

So far, only the anime series spanning 13 episodes and the OVA have been licensed in the [[United States]], by [[ADV Films]]. ADV Films said the series was one of their bestselling<ref>{{cite news |last=Solomon |first=Charles |title=Mean Girls |date=[[July 17]] [[2005]] |publisher=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/arts/television/17solo.html?ex=1145419200&en=f50bd37485179e26&ei=5070}}</ref> and "most notorious"<ref>{{cite press release | publisher = ADV Films | date = [[September 28]] [[2005]] | title = Great Reason To Give Thanks With Nine New Releases November 15th | url =http://www.advfilms.com/GEN_PRDetails.asp?ID=1724 }}</ref> releases of 2005. ''Elfen Lied'' and the character Nana were the inspiration for the popular [[Clone Manga]] fan-[[webcomic]] "Nana's Everyday Life" which has been completed and fully translated from English into 6 other languages.<ref>{{cite web | title = Nana's Everyday Life | publisher = Clone Manga | url = http://manga.clone-army.org/nana.php | accessdate = 2006-08-21}}</ref>

==Plot==

The story begins with a naked young girl named Lucy escaping under odd circumstances from an insular [[research]] facility off the coast of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in the [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] of Japan. Lucy manages to nonchalantly dismember and slay a fair number of the staff and guards with a form of seemingly [[supernatural]] power and gets outside. A [[sniper]] is seen trying to shoot her, only managing to ricochet a bullet off her metal helmet. Lucy then falls off a cliff into the sea, bleeding from her head but ultimately surviving and evading the research staff.
[[Image:Elfen Lied ep2 Vectors.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A diclonius' "vectors" take the form of long arms that resonate at a speed that causes them to be undetectable by sight.]]
Lucy is not a normal human but rather a [[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|diclonius]]: a [[mutant]] variant of humans with two small horns on their heads (hence the name diclonius) that resemble [[cat]] ears. The diclonius race possesses [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] powers through use of their "vectors", long arms that resonate at a speed that causes them to be undetectable by sight. The number and reach of the vectors depend directly on the diclonius.

The day after Lucy's escape, a boy named Kohta arrives at Kamakura to meet his [[cousin]] Yuka. Kohta has come to study at the local [[university]] and has been given lodging at an old, family-owned [[Ryokan (inn)|inn]], the "{{Nihongo|Maple|楓|''Kaede''}} Inn", provided he acts as the [[caretaker]]. After meeting with Yuka, they go for a visit to the beach and find Lucy washed up on the shore, still naked and bleeding from her head. The head [[Physical trauma|trauma]] Lucy experienced causes her to develop a [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]]. In stark contrast to the cold and sadistic Lucy, this personality is completely docile, harmless and is incapable at first of saying anything other than "Nyū". Not knowing what to do with her, Kohta and Yuka take her back to the inn to look after her and name her "Nyū". Yuka quickly decides that it will be best that she also live at the inn.

Kohta, Nyū, and Yuka begin settling into their life at the inn and Nyū begins to dredge up painful repressed memories from Kohta's past. Meanwhile, the researchers from the laboratory where Lucy was held begin searching for her, dispatching both human and diclonius agents to hunt her down.

==Main characters==

{{main|List of Elfen Lied characters}}
{{main|Lucy (Elfen Lied)}}
[[Image:Evil Lucy.png|left|100px|Lucy]]
{{Nihongo|'''Lucy'''|ルーシー |Rūshī}} is a [[teenage]] [[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|diclonius]] girl around 18 years old, Lucy has four vectors with a limited range of two meters.<ref>Note: These restrictions on Lucy's vectors are not present in the manga.</ref> However, she can be swift and lethal within that range, and will use any nearby objects as high velocity [[projectile]]s to kill at greater distances. She is also capable of stopping or deflecting most standard ammunition when she concentrates on the task. Lucy hates humans mainly because of how she was treated by her human peers as a child. Consequently, she discounts non-diclonii, claiming they are not real people. She seems to lack [[empathy]], kills without much concern, and acts somewhat sadistically. Despite this lack of concern for human life she will not harm Kohta.
{{-}}
[[Image:Nyu.png|right|100px|Nyü]]
{{Nihongo|'''Nyū'''|にゅう}} is a [[dissociative identity disorder|split personality]] of Lucy that developed after a [[.50 BMG]] round ricocheted off a metallic helmet encasing her head. Nyū has a childlike personality and infantile knowledge of the world, forgetting even that she is a [[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|diclonius]] and how to use or manifest her vectors leaving her a human with horns. She initially lacks spoken [[language]] skills; however, she eventually learns a handful of words and phrases. Nyū is innocent and incapable of violent acts, a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the normally cold and sadistic Lucy; she is the manifestation of her "good side". When Nyū is attacked violently (or hit on the head), she regresses into Lucy; likewise, when Lucy is treated with love and kindness, she will uncontrollably switch back into Nyū.

[[Image:Kouta.png|left|100px|Kohta]]
{{Nihongo|'''Kohta'''|コウタ|Kōta}} is around 19 years old and enters the story when his cousin's family allows him to move in to their closed down inn in exchange for maintenance while he goes to a local [[university]]. Kohta has [[repressed memory|repressed]] [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] [[memory|memories]] of his father's and sister's deaths during his childhood at Lucy's hands. Because of his repressing his memories, Kohta does not remember Lucy from when he met her earlier as a child. Due in part to his loss, he has a soft spot for girls in trouble and is extremely generous and protective to the girls around him. He is more forgiving in the anime, but in the manga when he gets his memories back he truly is unforgiving about Lucy killing his father and sister.

[[Image:Yuka.png|right|100px]]
{{Nihongo|'''Yuka'''|ユカ}} is Kohta's [[cousin]].<ref>Elfen Lied Ep. 1: Yuka greets Kohta and then says "''Yuka desu... Itoko no...''"「ユカです…従姉妹の…」, which quite unambiguously translates as "I'm Yuka. Your cousin."</ref> She is also around 19 years old and planning to attend the same university as Kohta. She moves in with him at the [[inn]] after having not seen him in many years. Having had a crush on Kohta since childhood, she is in love with him,<ref>Yuka's relationship with Kohta may be considered [[taboo]] or illegally [[incest]]uous by [[United States|U.S.]] viewers, but relationships between cousins is not considered scandalous in [[Japan]] and is a topic seen regularly in anime. See: ''[http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=1373 Why is Romance Between Cousins Common in Anime?]''</ref> and is therefore jealous of Kohta's attention to Nyū, to the point of being very irrational.

===Side stories===

The manga also features several [[side story|side stories]] from previous works done by [[Lynn Okamoto]]. These stories came included with the release of certain volumes of the manga as bonus material (not related to Elfen Lied) for fans of the manga to collect.
* ''MOL'' - featured in volume 1
* ''Digitopolis'' - featured in volume 2
* ''Memoria'' - featured in volume 3
* ''Carrera'' - featured in volume 5

In addition, volume 8 includes two other stories that form part of the Elfen Lied universe.

* ''NOZOMI'' is the first side story featured, and explains Nozomi's past and why she chooses to move into the Kaede Inn. This tale is in canon with the continuity of the main storyline.
* The second side story that follows after NOZOMI involves the whole residents at the Kaede Inn throwing a party and indulging themselves in excessive drinking. Nana and Mayu fall asleep, allowing both Yuka and Nyū to release their inhibitions and deliver an intimate [[fan service]] to Kohta. Unfortunately, their fun is suddenly brought to an end when Nyū without warning switches back to Lucy who seems rather upset, ending the story with a [[cliffhanger]]. This tale is not canon for Elfen Lied's overall plot.

==Anime==
===Format===

{{main|List of Elfen Lied episodes}}
The [[television]] series, directed by [[Mamoru Kanbe]], animated by ARMS and produced by [[GENCO]] and [[VAP]], ran for 13 episodes and adapted approximately the first 60 out of 107 chapters of the manga. Episodes 1 to 11 of the anime are in [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] with the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the storyline for volumes 1 to 6 of the manga, faithfully adapting most of the events happening in the latter. The last two TV episodes strayed from the manga's continuity and gave an original conclusion to the anime. The series' author, [[Lynn Okamoto]], has a brief [[cameo appearance]] as a special guest in episode 12.

Elfen Lied first aired on [[TV Tokyo]]'s AT-X satellite channel from [[July 25]] [[2004]] to [[October 17]] [[2004]] and was broadcast again in 2005. The anime was licensed by [[ADV Films]] in the [[United States]] in [[2004]] and was released on [[DVD]] in [[2005]]. A single 24 minute [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] episode was also released. It takes place between episodes 10 and 11 of the original TV series, and for that reason, some refer to it as ''episode 10.5'', ''OVA special'', or even as ''episode 14''. The special itself takes on a lighter tone and answers some questions of the early episodes rather than advancing the plot. During the ''Anime Boston 2006''<ref>{{cite web | title=Anime Boston 2006 - A.D. Vision | publisher=Anime News Network |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention.php?id=317 | accessdate=2006-06-05}}</ref> (May 26—28) [[Anime convention|convention]], ADV Films acquired the distribution rights of the OVA for release in the [[United States]].

The series is currently airing in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[Propeller TV]] ([[Sky Digital (UK)|Sky Digital]]) as part of Anime Network's launch in the UK. So far the series has aired uncut with the exception of one of Mayu's flashbacks in Episode 5.

In a posting on the official [[Adult Swim]] messageboard, Adult Swim programming director Kim Manning revealed that Adult Swim inquired into possibly airing the series, but the censorship board revealed that the series would have to be so heavily edited in order to air that it would have been "unintelligible", and it does not appear that it will air on the channel at any time in the future.

===Plot deviations===

Compared to its manga original, the approach and depth of information presented by the anime involving the diclonius race differs greatly. The diclonius virus is explained in less detail with scenes such as Professor Kakuzawa's explanation of the half-diclonius status and [[ancestry]] of his family to Lucy being omitted. The diclonius characters are depicted as all having the same hair color, whereas in the manga Lucy/Nyū had pink hair, Mariko was blond, and Nana had dark purple hair. The diclonius characters in general are shown to have distinct limits on their vectors' quantity and range, which is not true in the manga. 

Characters were introduced in the manga that were otherwise completely omitted from the anime series. An example of this early on in the manga is an acquaintance of Yuka's, referred to as "Nozomi-chan." Similarly, the [[music box]] playing the "Lilium" melody that is featured in the anime does not appear in the manga.

===Style and themes===

[[Image:Elfen Lied Ep 8 Lucy.png|right|thumb|Young Lucy lashes out violently at her tormentors. Strong graphical violence is prevalent throughout the series.]]
Throughout the series, there is a great deal of graphic [[nudity]], blood and gore, extreme [[graphic violence]] as well as [[psychology|psychological]] [[violence]]. One of the most prevalent motifs of the series is the humanity of the diclonius, especially contrasted against the inhumanity of ordinary people. One reviewer described the series as "devoted to quite a few of the darker, more callous factors of human nature".<ref name="them1"/> Throughout the series there are various incidences of human [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]], casual beatings, cruel experimentation, [[paedophilia|pedophilic]] [[rape]] and outright killing. The series has drawn criticism as being "overly blatant"<ref name="them2"/> or "sad and forced"<ref>{{cite web | title = Negative First Impression Theater: Elfen Lied | publisher = Iron Circus | date = [[February 12]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.ironcircus.com/blog/000319.html | accessdate = 2007-01-22}}</ref> in this regard. 

The series juxtaposes many different tones and genres and was described by a reviewer as "mixing insane amounts of violence with a heavy dose of ultracuteness."<ref name="shelf">{{cite web | last = Dong | first = Bamboo | title = Shelf Life - Sound of Bounce on Free Throw | publisher = Anime News Network | date = [[June 29]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2005-06-29 | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}</ref> The series also involves romantic [[sub-plot]]s as well as many comic moments. Elfen Lied has been described as similar to, or borrowing elements from ''[[Chobits]]'', ''[[3x3 Eyes]]''<ref name="scifi"/> and ''[[Gunslinger Girl]]''.<ref name="shelf"/>

===Theme songs===

;Opening theme: "[[Lilium (song)|Lilium]]" by [[Kumiko Noma]]
;Ending theme: "[[Be your girl]]" by [[Chieko Kawabe]]

==Cultural references==
===Art===

The opening and ending sequences feature artistic drawings of the principal characters. These characters are drawn in a style based on [[Gustav Klimt]]'s paintings, imitating poses, colors, and patterns.<ref name="scifi"/> In the following comparison images, the left side of each image shows Klimt's work, and on the right, Elfen Lied's counterpart:

===Music and poetry===

The [[Germany|German]] [[Lied|song]] ''[[Elfenlied]]'' ("Elf Song") appears in the manga<ref>{{ja icon}} {{cite book | first=Lynn| last=Okamoto | coauthors= | title=Elfen Lied Volume 5 | publisher=Shueisha | pages=154 | id=ISBN 4-08-876477-3}} </ref> and is credited to the composer [[Hugo Wolf]]. A poem by [[Eduard Mörike]] is the basis for Wolf’s version. The song does not appear in the anime as it is taught to Nyū by the manga-only character [[List of Elfen Lied characters#Minor characters|Nozomi]].
