'''Pasta''' is a type of [[food]] made from the [[flour]] of certain grains mixed with [[water]] and/or [[Egg (food)|eggs]], which is then kneaded and formed into various shapes, and boiled prior to consumption.  While the name comes from [[Italy]], pasta is very popular all over the world. The [[English language|English]] word ''pasta'' generally refers to [[noodle]]s and other food products made from a flour and water paste, often including egg and [[edible salt|salt]]. Less frequently, the term ''maccheroni'' (''[[macaroni]]'' in English) is used for the same products, especially when in combination with [[cheese]].

Pasta can also denote dishes in which pasta products are the primary ingredient, served with sauce or seasonings. The word comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pasta'' which shares its origins with "paste", meaning "dough", "pasta", or "pastry" as in "small cake".  As recently as [[1918]] the English word "paste" was used instead of or alongside the Italian ''pasta''. [http://www.bartleby.com/87/0006.html] Today the word "pasta" is reserved for Italian-style noodles in English-speaking countries, while the word "noodle" has a more general meaning.

Dried Italian-style pasta is made from [[durum]] wheat [[semolina]], which gives it a light yellow colour and a slightly chewy texture when properly prepared. It is traditionally cooked 'al dente' - with a slight bite. The finest Italian dried pastas are rolled between copper rollers. 

Certain [[United States|American]] pastas are produced from a mixture of [[Farina]] and Semolina. Such pastas often have a different texture and flavor and are typically used in casseroles or other dishes. Asian-style noodles as well as most fresh noodles are made from regular (non-durum) wheat flour.  Some pasta varieties, such as [[Pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. 
[[Gnocchi]] are often listed among pasta dishes, although they are quite different in ingredients (mainly milled [[potato]]es) and mode of preparation.

Pasta is made either by [[extrusion]], where the ingredients are forced through holes in a plate known as a [[die]], or by lamination, in which dough is kneaded, folded, rolled to thickness, then cut by slitters. Fresh pasta cooks quickly and has a delicate taste, but spoils relatively quickly due to its high water content. Dry pasta generally contains about 10% moisture, which makes it [[shelf stable]] for about three years. 

Packed refrigerated or frozen pasta can be found virtually everywhere in the world. More varieties tend to be available where [[expatriate]] Italian communities have taken root. Italian companies such as [[Arienti & Cattaneo]] [[Ima]], [[Ostoni]], and [[Zamboni]] manufacture machines for producing "fresh" packed pasta, which has a [[shelf life]] of around 7 weeks.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that consuming five servings of fortified grain foods &mdash;  a serving might be ½ cup of cooked pasta or a slice of bread, for example &mdash; could add another 220 micrograms or more of [[folate]] per day, to help people meet their recommended folate levels.

== History ==

Though disputed, most anthropologists believe pasta was developed independently by a number of peoples around the globe{{fact}}. In each of these places, locally available grain was the primary starch source in the diet. Before the invention of pasta, grains were consumed as a [[porridge|gruel]] or grain paste or were ground into [[flour]] and eaten as bread. Pasta noodles were likely developed as an alternative to gruel or bread. Pasta noodles can be created even where there is no oven, or not enough fuel to support an oven. In contrast, producing bread requires a great investment in time and effort.

Noodles dating back to about 2000 B.C. have been found near [[Lajia]] on the [[Huang He]] in Western [[China]].[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4335160.stm] Although the site was devastated by an [[earthquake]] followed by a [[flood]], the yellow noodles survived in an upside-down clay pot under a thick layer of [[loess]]. Archeologist Houyuan Lu discovered the noodles and was able to take photos. Analysis showed that the noodles, with a length of approximately half a meter and a diameter of three millimeters, were produced from [[millet]].

Chinese noodles before the age of industrialized food production were always used fresh, and they consist of one giant noodle mass through the cooking process because it is considered bad [[luck]] in China to cut noodles before serving.

The earliest known records of noodles in Europe are found on [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tomb decorations in central Italy from around 400 B.C.{{fact}} 

It is believed that [[Marco Polo]] brought some kind of pasta to Italy from China, during the 1200s{{fact}}

Common pasta sauces in northern Italy include [[pesto]] (a raw amalgam of pounded [[basil]], [[pine nuts]], and [[garlic]] with grated [[Parmigiano Reggiano]] and [[Pecorino Sardo]] cheeses and [[olive oil]]) and [[ragù alla bolognese]] (a rich and slowly simmered sauce based on finely chopped beef or veal); in central Italy, simple [[tomato sauce]] and [[amatriciana]] (a red tomato/wine based sauce, usually including onion and bacon strips) and [[carbonara]], an egg-based sauce; in Southern Italy, spicy tomato, garlic, and olive oil based sauces, often paired with fresh vegetables or seafood. Varieties include [[puttanesca]] (tomatoes, olives and capers), [[spaghetti alla norma]] (tomatoes and eggplant), [[pasta con le sarde]] (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil). 

[[Fettuccine Alfredo]], with cheese and butter, and spaghetti with tomato sauce with or without ground meat or meatballs are popular Italian-style dishes in the [[United States]].

== Pasta varieties ==
Pasta comes in many different shapes and sizes. There are simple string-shaped pasta like [[spaghetti]] and [[vermicelli]], ribbon-shaped ones like [[fettuccine]] and [[linguine]], short tubes like [[elbow macaroni]] and [[penne]], large sheets like [[lasagna]], and hollow pasta stuffed with filling, like [[ravioli]], [[manicotti]], and [[tortellini]]. The names of the pasta often describe the shape. For example, spaghetti from spagho (string), farfalle meaning butterflies, vermicelli, little worms, ''etc.'' On some manufacturers' packages, there is a '''cut number''' which identifies the specific [[extrusion|extruder]] and the shape, length, and width of the pasta.[http://www.princepasta.com/faq.htm]  These numbers are not standardized, so for instance De Cecco's #7 is linguine, while [[Barilla]]'s #7 is thick spaghetti.[http://woolcofoods.com/Product%20Book.pdf] See [[List of pasta]] for more.
