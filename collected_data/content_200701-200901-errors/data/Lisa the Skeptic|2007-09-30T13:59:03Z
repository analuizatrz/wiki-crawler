== Plot == 

As [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] attempts to get a [[motorboat]], a new [[shopping mall]] in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] is being built on an area where a large number of [[fossil]]s were found. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] condemns and protests the building of the mall. Thanks to her protest, it prompts the school to conduct an archaeological dig. When Lisa is digging, it reveals a human [[skeleton]] with wings. Springfield's residents are convinced it is an [[angel]], and Homer cashes in by moving the skeleton into the family's garage; however, Lisa is skeptical, believing it may not actually be an angel, and even has [[Stephen Jay Gould]] test a sample of the skeleton.  The next day, Dr. Gould runs to the Simpson house and said the tests came out inconclusive and after Lisa on television compares belief in angels to belief in [[unicorn]]s and [[leprechaun]]s, Springfield's religious zealots riot and destroy all of the scientific [[institution]]s. In keeping with the typical collective Springfield intelligence, the victims of this rampage include a [[Christian Science]] library. Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton; however, it has disappeared.

When the skeleton reappears, it carries a foreboding message that [[Apocalypse|The End]] will come at sundown. As for science vs. religion, Judge Snyder issues a [[injunction|restraining order]] that keeps science and religion 500 yards apart at all times. Sundown approaches, and Springfield's citizens are frightened, but nothing catastrophic occurs. Lisa gets prepared to tell off everyone and when she begins, the skeleton suddenly yells "Prepare for the end... the end of high prices!" and is hoisted over to the entrance of a new discount shopping mall. Lisa realizes that the "end is near" saga was actually a [[publicity stunt]] for the mall as a way to exploit the deepest beliefs of people, and calls for a [[boycott]] of the mall. However, the bargain-hunting public still go shopping immediately. Dr. Gould also confesses to Lisa that he actually did not do any testing. In the end Marge points out to Lisa that, despite all her skepticism, for a few seconds while the Angel was rising Lisa really did believe the Angel was real. Lisa denies this, but thanks her mother for her support in her moment of weakness.

==Cultural references==
* Some elements of the story are shared with [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s [[short story]] "[[A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings]]". Both feature the appearance of an angel who is at some point put on display for paying visitors.  The story also bears a resemblance to the [[Cardiff Giant]], a real-life hoax.
* ''Springfield's Dumbest Criminal'' program is similar to the TV show ''[[America's Dumbest Criminals]]''.
* The blue whale that hangs in the Springfield Museum is much like the one that hangs in real life at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].
* Homer's song for the angel is much like [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] composition ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Hallelujah Chorus]]''.
*The magazine Lisa is reading when the sun goes down is ''[[Scientific American]]''.
*The robot fleeing the burning building is Professor Frink's robot Floyd from "[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]".
*When Lisa and her schoolmates are digging up the skeleton there's a scene with a sunset that is clearly a reference to the [[Indiana Jones]] film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=July 2007}}
*The angel statue appears as a collector card in the third mission in the video game [[The Simpsons Hit & Run]].
*When they are waiting for sundown, Hibbert's wife appears yellow.
*When the skeleton appears for the first time it has bones which represent wings on his entire arms, in the next shot he only has them on his forearms.
*In one scene, Moe claims he is paralyzed when he is crushed by a mammoth tusk.  In the next scene, Moe is seen running with the crowd
*This is one of the many times that Ralph Wiggum mispronounces Principal Skinner's name as Prinskipper Skippal, Prinnippal Skimster!
