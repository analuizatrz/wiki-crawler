{{nihongo|'''IJA Twentieth Division'''|第20師団|Hohei Ni-Ju Shidan}} was an [[infantry division]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Its [[call sign]] was the {{nihongo|'''Morning Division'''|朝兵団|Asa Heidan}}. 

==History==
The 20th Division and the [[19th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|19th Division]] were raised on [[24 December]] [[1915]] as a garrison force for [[Korea]]. After Japan's victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and subsequent occupation, and then annexation of Korea, the need was felt for a dedicated garrison force, raised from people with local knowledge. The 20th Division was stationed in central Korea, in what is now [[Yongsan-gu]], [[Seoul]] and was responsible for the security of southern Korea. Although officially raised in 1915, due to budgetary issues, the 20th Division existed only on paper until 1918.

After the [[Manchurian Incident]], its strength was increased by the addition of the 29th Infantry Regiment. In 1931, the 20th Division was stationed in the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] at [[Jinzhou]]. In 1937 it was present at the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. However, in July 1937, without having seen any combat, it was withdrawn back to [[Keijo]].

In September, 1942, its 77th Infantry Regiment was elevated into the [[30th Infantry Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|30th Division]]. From 1943, the remainder of the 20th Infantry Division was transferred to the [[Japanese 18th Army]] in the Southern Area Command ([[New Guinea]]). Of the approximately 25,000 men dispatched, only 1711 survived the war. More men died in New Guinea from [[malaria]] and malnutrition than from combat with the Americans or Australians.

==Organization==
The original [[order of battle]] for the 20th Division included:
* 39th Infantry Regiment 
* 40th  Infantry Regiment 
* 28th  Cavalry Regiment 
* 26th Field Artillery Regiment
* 20th Engineering Regiment

As of July 1937, the 20th Division was a (Square Division) commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Bunsaburo Kawakishi]]:<br>
