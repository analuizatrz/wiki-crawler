'''Sarah Trimmer''' ([[January 6]], [[1741]]-[[December 15]], [[1810]]) was a noted writer and critic of [[children's literature]] in the [[18th century|eighteenth century]]. Her periodical, ''The Guardian of Education'', helped define and legitimate the genre of children's literature.  Her most popular children's book, ''Fabulous Histories'', was reprinted for over a century.

Trimmer was an active philanthropist as well as author; she founded several [[Sunday school]]s and [[charity school]]s in her parish. To help with education, she not only wrote textbooks for these schools, but she also penned manuals for other women interested in starting their own schools. Trimmer's efforts inspired other women, such as [[Hannah More]], to establish Sunday school programs and to write for children and the poor.

Of all of Trimmer's endeavors, it was ''The Guardian of Education'' which had the greatest impact on British culture. In this quarterly, she reviewed hundreds of children's books and helped to define the boundaries of the emerging [[genre]] of children's literature. Her reviews affected the sales of books and the ways in which children's books were subsequently written and edited. She also wrote the first history of children's literature, establishing a canon of the early landmarks in children's literature that scholars still use today.

==Early life==
Trimmer was born on [[January 6]], [[1741]] in [[Ipswich]] to Joshua and Sarah (Bell) Kirby. She had one younger brother, William; apparently she was always the better writer of the two, for she would sometimes compose his school essays for him.<ref>Trimmer, Sarah.

Rivington  (1816), 8-9. Retrieved on [[17 April]] [[2007]].</ref> As a young girl, Trimmer attended Mrs. Justiner’s boarding school in Ipswich, an experience she always fondly remembered.<ref>Yarde, D.M. ''The Life and Works of Sarah Trimmer, a Lady of Brentford''. Middlesex: The Hounslow District Historical Society (1972), 15.</ref> In 1755 the family moved to [[London]] when her father, a noted artist who had written several important works on perspective, became the tutor of perspective to the Prince of Wales.<ref>Grenby, Matthew. "Introduction." ''The Guardian of Education''. Bristol: Thoemmes Press (2002), vi.</ref> Because of her father's connections within the artistic community, Trimmer was able to meet the painters [[William Hogarth]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]] as well as the by-then legendary writer [[Samuel Johnson]]. She made a marked impression on Johnson when she immediately produced her pocket copy of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' in order to help settle a dispute between her father and Johnson over a particular passage. Johnson, delighted that she admired Milton enough to carry his works with her at all times, "subsequently invited her to his house and presented her with a volume of his famous periodical ''[[The Rambler]]''".<ref>Yarde, 17.</ref> In 1759, at the urging of his former pupil, the Prince of Wales (soon to be [[George III]]), Trimmer's father was given the position of Clerk of the Works to the Royal Household at [[Kew Palace]] and the family moved to [[Kew]].<ref>Rodgers, Betsy.

==Motherhood and philanthropy==
[[Image:TrimmerCharity.png|200px|left|thumb|Title page from the first edition of ''The Œconomy of Charity'']]
Trimmer was very attached to her parents; after her marriage, she walked to visit her father every day, later accompanied by her eldest children. She and her husband had twelve children in all—six boys and six girls. Trimmer was responsible for her children's education and it was her ongoing duties as a teacher as well as a mother that helped spark her interest in education.<ref>Rodgers, 115.</ref> 

Inspired by [[Robert Raikes]], Trimmer also became active in the [[Sunday school]] movement, establishing the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She and two of the ministers, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, in her parish organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighborhood.<ref>Yarde, 31.</ref> Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil.<ref>Yarde, 31.</ref> The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls.<ref>Yarde, 31.</ref> While some other educational reformers of the period such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately.<ref>Rodgers, 119.</ref> The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to eventually read the Bible; the students were especially encouraged to keep clean—“a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them."<ref>Yarde, 33.</ref> Trimmer's schools became so well-known and admired that [[Queen Charlotte]] even asked Trimmer's advice on founding a Sunday school.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," vii.</ref> 

After her visit with the queen, Trimmer was galvanized to write ''The Œconomy of Charity'' so that other women would know how to organize their own Sunday schools.<ref>Rodgers, 124.</ref> But her book accomplished much more than this. While proponents of Sunday schools such as Raikes and Trimmer claimed that the schools would help control the growing social unrest of the poor, critics "warned that these charities actually engendered and fostered the very anarchic forces they were attempting to stem."<ref>Wills, Deborah. “Sarah Trimmer’s ''Œconomy of Charity'': Politics and Morality in the Sunday School State.” ''Lumen'' 12 (1993), 157.</ref>   The Sunday school debate was waged in churches, in Parliament and in print; in publishing ''The Œconomy of Charity'', Trimmer was entering this vigorous debate. As Deborah Wills has argued, ''The Œconomy of Charity'' "is actually informed by a highly politicized subtext which anticipates, subverts, and counters anti-Sunday School arguments. She outlines a programme through which the Sunday School, when properly administered, can serve as a means of instituting social control and intensifying hierarchy. . . . Trimmer’s carefully modest and unassuming text is thus revealed as a middle-class manifesto for the appropriation of social, political, and religious power in the name of moral instruction.”<ref>Wills, 157-8.</ref> For example, she contends that Sunday schools are not simply teaching their pupils to read the Bible—they are also teaching them to how to interpret the Bible, that is, they are teaching them the proper theological and political conclusions to draw from the Bible.<ref>Wills, 159.</ref> Furthermore, Trimmer argues that the responsibility of educating the poor rests on the shoulders of the middle class alone. In eliminating the aristocracy from an active role in her philanthropic programs, "Trimmer ensures that those who actually regulate the Sunday School curriculum are those who will both embody and perpetuate bourgeois culture.”<ref>Wills, 162.</ref> As Wills points out, this distinguishes her from other philanthropists of the time such as [[Hannah More]].

Trimmer also founded and oversaw [[charity school]]s in her neighborhood. She directed particularly promising students from her Sunday schools, which met only once a week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in her journal, from her perspective these schools "afford[ed] a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy."<ref>Trimmer, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=0KicgjUXZCaBpD9GnFNOMH&id=b_PeATVipZUC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=some+account+trimmer ''Some Account''], 220. Retrieved on [[17 April]] [[2007]].</ref> While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge]].<ref>Yarde, 40-2.</ref> Trimmer criticized the rote learning that went on in traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic [[catechism|catechetical]] method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions.<ref>Rodgers, 118.</ref> She wrote in her journal, “my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures."<ref>Trimmer, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=0KicgjUXZCaBpD9GnFNOMH&id=b_PeATVipZUC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=some+account+trimmer ''Some Account''], 218. Retrieved on [[17 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long, but the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.<ref>Yarde, 43.</ref>

William Keutsch, a scholar of the eighteenth century, has criticized Trimmer's projects as naive and moralistic:
<blockquote>
[There is] no indication that Sarah Trimmer based her many efforts to instruct and improve the children of the poor on detailed social analysis, but it is apparent that she was deeply disturbed not only by their needs but also about the increasing pauperization of the country. Whether she understood that society was changing from a more feudal to a more modern bourgeois structure, in which many of the stabilizing old personal ties were removed and replaced by the cash-nexus, is not clear. . . . on the whole she displays no interest in the social and economic causes of poverty. Instead she offers a model of improvement which rests on a rigorous division of the working people and the poor into black and white: the deserving and the undeserving poor, the godly and the ungodly, the respectable and dutiful and the rebellious and undutiful, the idle and the industrious, that is, on an alternating identification of poverty with virtue and vice.<ref>Keutsch, Wilfried. "Teaching the Poor: Sarah Trimmer, God's Own Handmaiden." ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' 76.3 (1994), 47.</ref>
</blockquote>
Although Sunday schools such as the ones established by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars such as Keutsch as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur has argued that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.<ref>Laqueur, Thomas Walter. ''Religion and Respectability: Sunday Schools and Working Class Culture, 1780-1850''. New Haven: Yale University Press (1976), 21.</ref>

==Literary career==
In a literary career that spanned more than a quarter of a century, Trimmer authored thirty-three texts (that have currently been identified by scholars).<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," viii.</ref> While many of her texts were for children, some of her works were also for specific adult audiences, such as ''The Œconomy of Charity'', while others were written for both children and adults, such as ''The Servant’s Friend'' (1786-7) which was written to instruct servants of all ages.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," viii.</ref>

Inspired by [[Madame de Genlis|Madame de Genlis']] ''Adèle et Théodore'' (1782), Trimmer also commissioned sets of illustrations of the Bible for which she provided the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and British history. All of these sets were wildly popular and could either be purchased together (commentary and prints) or individually. The prints were usually hung on walls or bound into books.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," viii.</ref>

Trimmer worked with four different publishers throughout her career—John Marshall, T.N. Longman, G. Robinson, and Joseph Johnson—and by 1800 no author had more works in the [[John Newbery|Newbery]] catalogue, the catalogue which sold the most children's literature, than Trimmer.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," ix.</ref> Eventually, Trimmer stopped publishing with Joseph Johnson, though, because she disagreed with his politics—he was a supporter of the [[French Revolution]] and was publishing works which she considered subversive.<ref>Janowitz, Anne. “Amiable and Radial Sociability: Anna Barbauld’s ‘Free  Familiar Conversation.’” ''Romantic Sociability: Social Networks and Literary Culture in Britain 1770-1840''. Eds. Gillian Russell and Clara Tuite. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2002), 71.</ref>

===''An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature''===
[[Image:EasyIntroductionTitle.png|200px|thumb|right|Title page from the first edition of ''An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1780)]]
Trimmer's first book was ''An easy introduction to the knowledge of nature, and reading the holy scriptures, adapted to the capacities of children'' (1780); it built on the revolution in children's literature already begun by [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]]. In 1793 a version of this book was added to the catalogue of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge]] and after 77 years it had sold over 750,000 copies.<ref>Ruwe, Donelle. “Guarding the British Bible from Rousseau: Sarah Trimmer, William Godwin, and the Pedagogical Periodical.” ''Children’s Literature'' 29 (2000), 11.</ref> Although inspired by Barbauld's books, Aileen Fyfe has argued that Trimmer's text differs dramatically from Barbauld's in its religious orientation. Barbauld was a [[nonconformism|dissenter]] and thus more inclined, according to Fyfe, to "encourage curiosity, observation, and reasoning."<ref>Fyfe, Aileen. “Reading Children’s Books in Late Eighteenth-Century Dissenting Families.” ''The Historical Journal'' 43.2 (2000), 469.</ref> Trimmer, in contrast, as a [[high church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] "was more concerned with nature than with the sciences . . . the natural world was to be seen as awe-inspiring, and full of evidences of divine foresight, beneficence, and design."<ref>Fyfe, 460.</ref> These beliefs are even reflected in the structure of the text; "since Trimmer’s goal was to show that the whole of Creation was full of wonderfully designed objects, the order in which this was done did not particularly matter. However, if Aikin and Barbauld [in ''Evenings at Home''] were to lay down the foundations for a rational education, and to show how the sciences can provide a training in logical thinking and reasoning, the systematic structure [of the text] was essential.”<ref>Fyfe, 471.</ref> And while Barbauld's texts and those she wrote with her brother, John Aikin, emphasized dialogues between teacher and pupil, Trimmer's textual conversations, Fyfe notes, were "controlled by the parent."<ref>Fyfe, 469.</ref>

Yet, as Donelle Ruwe has pointed out in her essay on Trimmer, ''An Easy Introduction'' challenges eighteenth-century notions of the proper roles for women. The mother in Trimmer's text acts as a "spiritual leader" and demonstrates that a woman is capable of "theological reasoning."<ref>Ruwe, 10.</ref> Such depictions are in direct contrast to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's]] claims that women are only capable of memorizing religious dogma and are incapable of any sophisticated thought on the subject. Furthermore, Trimmer's mother tries to educate her children in a straightforward manner instead of employing the "manipulative" tricks of the tutor in Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]''.<ref>Ruwe, 10.</ref>

[[Image:TrimmerFabulousHistories.jpg|left|thumb|Title page from the first edition of Trimmer's ''Fabulous Histories'' (1786)]]

===''Fabulous Histories''===
''Fabulous Histories'' (later known as ''The Story of the Robins''), Trimmer's most popular work, was first published in 1786, and remained in print until the beginning of the twentieth century.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," viii.</ref> ''Fabulous Histories'' tells the story of two families, a [[European Robin|robin]] family and a human family. Both families must learn to live together without hurting each other while at the same time the members of each family, specifically the human children and the baby robins, must also learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, this means learning kindness to animals which will hopefully then lead to "universal benevolence." According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of eighteenth-century children's literature, “in its depiction of eighteenth-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer’s ''Fabulous Histories'' was the most representative children’s book of the period."<ref>Pickering, Jr., Samuel F. ''John Locke and Children’s Books in Eighteenth-Century England''. Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press (1981), 29.</ref> In this book Trimmer expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate her work. For example, as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children's literature explains, “the notion of hierarchy that underpins ''Fabulous Histories'' is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals . . . [but] the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced."<ref>Cosslett, Tess. "Fabulous Histories and Papillonades." ''Talking Animals in British Children’s Fiction, 1786-1914''. Burlington, VT: Ashgate (2006), 41.</ref> Trimmer also expresses her fear of the power of fiction in the preface, explaining to readers that the [[fable]] is not real and that animals cannot ''really'' speak.<ref>Trimmer, Sarah. ''Fabulous Histories. Designed for the Instruction of Children, Respecting their Treatment of Animals''. London: Printed for T. Longman (1786), x-xi.</ref> Worried about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers, Trimmer always referred to the text as ''Fabulous Histories'', and not as ''The Story of the Robins''; moreover, she never allowed the book to be illustrated within her lifetime.<ref>Jackson, Mary V. ''Engines of Instruction, Mischief, and Magic: Children’s Literature in England from Its Beginnings to 1839''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press (1989), 143.</ref> Moira Ferguson places Trimmer's themes in a larger historical context, arguing that "the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [the] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad. . . . The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate easily.”<ref>Ferguson, Moira. "Sarah Trimmer's Warring Worlds." ''Animal Advocacy and Englishwomen, 1780-1900: Patriots, Nation, and Empire''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press (1998), 7.</ref>

===''The Guardian of Education''===
Later in her life Trimmer published the influential ''Guardian of Education'' (June 1802-September 1806) which included ideas for instructing children and reviews of various contemporary children's books.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," x.</ref> Matthew Grenby, the foremost expert on Trimmer, estimates that the ''Guardian'''s circulation was between 1500 and 3500 copies per issue.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," x.</ref> Although one previous attempt had been made to regularly review children's books in a periodical in Britain,<ref>Immel, Andrea. "James Petit Andrews's 'Book' (1790): The First Critical Survey of English Children's Literature." ''Children's Literature'' 28 (2000): 147-63.</ref> according to Grenby, “it was a far less substantial and sustained enterprise than Trimmer’s.”<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xiv.</ref> Each issue of the ''Guardian'' was divided into three sections: extracts from texts which Trimmer thought would be edifying to her adult readers, an essay by Trimmer herself commenting on an issue related to education, and reviews of children's books. Trimmer undertook no small task in publishing her periodical. According to Grenby, she aimed “to assess the current state of educational policy and praxis in Britain and to shape its future direction.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xii.</ref> To do so, she evaluated the educational theories of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[John Locke]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah More]], [[Madame de Genlis]], [[Joseph Lancaster]], and [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]], among others. In her “Essay on Christian Education,” later published separately, she even proposed her own comprehensive educational program.

Trimmer took her reviewing very seriously and her over 400 reviews consitute a set of distinct values.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xvi.</ref> As a [[high-church]] [[Anglican]], she was intent on protecting Christianity from [[evangelicalism]] as well as [[secularism]]. She was also a staunch supporter of the conservative monarchy and an opponent of the [[French Revolution]]. As Grenby puts it, "her initial questions of any children’s books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy.”<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xvii-xviii.</ref> Religion was always Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on the inerrancy and the literal truth of the Bible illustrates her fundamentalism.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xxi.</ref> As she wrote in a letter to a friend: "I will only say, that the more I reflect on the subject, the more I am convinced that it is not right to ''supersede'' the ''figurative'' style in which they speak of ''God'' and ''divine things'', my opinion is, that whoever attempts to teach the truths of divine revelation, should follow the ''method'' of the ''inspired writers'' as nearly as possible" (emphasis Trimmer's).<ref>Trimmer, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=0KicgjUXZCaBpD9GnFNOMH&id=b_PeATVipZUC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=some+account+trimmer ''Some Account''], 61. Retrieved on [[17 April]] [[2007]].</ref> 

But Trimmer's fundamentalism, Grenby argues, does not necessarily make her the rigid thinker that critics such as Geoffrey Summerfield have presumed her to be.<ref>See Summerfield, Geoffrey. ''Fantasy and Reason: Children’s Literature in the Eighteenth Century''. Athens: The University of Georgia Press (1984), need page.</ref> Grenby points out that Trimmer, like Rousseau, believed children were naturally good; in this, she was arguing against centuries of tradition, particularly the tradition of [[original sin]] and the Puritanical attitudes towards raising children (exemplified by [[John Wesley]]).<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xxiv.</ref> She also agreed with "Rousseau’s key idea [while ironically attacking Rousseau's works themselves], later taken up by the Romantics, that children should not be forced to become adults too early," in particular that they should not be exposed to political issues too soon."<ref>Grenby, Matthew. "A Conservative Woman Doing Radical Things." ''Culturing the Child, 1690-1914''. Ed. Donelle Ruwe. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press (2005), 148-9.</ref> Trimmer also argued that mothers should not be solely responsible for the care of children; she was an advocate of "partnership-parenting" in which both the mother and the father contributed to the care of the family.<ref>Grenby, "A Conservative Woman Doing Radical Things," 150.</ref> Such an arrangement is reflected in the structure of the robin family in ''Fabulous Histories''.<ref>Trimmer, ''Fabulous Histories'', 2.</ref>

While Trimmer has often been described as a "shrill" critic by modern scholars, as Grenby points out “fewer than 50 [of the reviews] were chiefly negative, and of these only 18 were thoroughly excoriating. These were easily outweighed by the positive notices, although most of her reviews were mixed or – more surprisingly given her reputation for always impassioned appraisal – ambivalent.”<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xxviii.</ref> Her primary objections were to texts that challenged or altered the Bible, such as [[William Godwin|William Godwin's]] ''Bible Stories'',<ref>Ruwe, 8.</ref> and secondarily to books that promoted ideas she associated with the [[French Revolution]]. She also criticized books that included scenes of death, characters who were insane and representations of sexuality as well as books that might frighten children.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xxxv.</ref> She typically praises books which encourage intellectual instruction, such as [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld|Anna Barbauld's]] ''Lessons for Children''. Other notable children's authors that she reviews in her journal include [[Sarah Fielding]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], and [[Dorothy Kilner]]. Trimmer's reviews were extraordinarily influential. After she criticized the ending to [[John Newbery|John Newbery's]] ''Tom Telescope and the Philosophy of Tops and Balls'', the publishers of the text immediately removed the material she found offensive for the subsequent edition.<ref>Secord, James A. “Newton in the Nursery: Tom Telescope and the Philosophy of Tops and Balls, 1761-1838.” ''History of Science'' 23 (1985), 145.</ref>

With its 400 reviews, ''The Guardian of Education'' established [[children's literature]] as a genre. It decided, by what it deemed worthy of labeling a children's book ([[novel]]s, [[chapbook]]s, [[tract (literature)|tracts]], [[ballad]]s, and [[fairy tales]] were excluded), what counted as children's literature and what did not. Moreover, in one of her early essays, “Observations on the Changes which have taken place in Books for Children and Young Persons," Trimmer wrote the first history of children's literature, thereby setting out the first canon of children's literature. Its landmark books, such as [[Sarah Fielding|Sarah Fielding's]] ''The Governess'' (1749) and ''[[The History of Little Goody Two Shoes]]'' (1765), are still books scholars cite today as important in the development of the genre.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xl.</ref>

[[Image:TrimmerJesusWater.jpg|right|200px|thumb|From Trimmer's ''A Description of a Set of Prints Taken from the New Testament'': "Jesus spake unto them, saying, It is I, be not afraid. And Peter answered and said Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water: and he said, Come. And when Peter was come out of the ship, he (through the power of CHRIST) walked on the water likewise; but when he saw the wind boisterous, his faith or belief in CHRIST'S power, failed, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me! And immediately JESUS stretched forth his hand and caught him, saying, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"]]

====Fairy tales====
Trimmer condemned [[fairy tales]], such as the various translations of [[Charles Perrault|Charles Perrault's]] ''Histoires ou Contes du Temps passé'' (originally published in 1697), in ''The Guardian of Education'' because they suggested that children could too easily become successful (they did not have to work, in other words) and because they endorsed an irrational view of the world.<ref>Grenby, "A Conservative Woman Doing Radical Things," 152.</ref> Trimmer's view of fairy tales, which was widespread at the end of the eighteenth century, has become somewhat alien now and has been ridiculed by critics such as Summerfield. Nicholas Tucker explains that at the end of the eighteenth century, fairy tales were often found in [[chapbook]]s—cheap, disposable literature which often contained sensational stories such as [[Jack the Giant Killer]] and other lewder tales. Chapbooks were the literature of the poor and Trimmer was attempting to separate children's literature from texts she associated with the lower classes.<ref>Tucker, find invidividual pages.</ref>Even more importantly, Trimmer argued that fairy tales were full of superstition which encouraged irrationality in children; she contended that only stories which promoted Christianity could lead a child to become a rational adult.

====French revolution and religion====
In the pages of ''The Guardian of Education'', Trimmer condemned the [[French revolution]] and the philosophers whose works she believed underpinned it, particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. She argued that there was a vast conspiracy, organized by the atheistic and democratic revolutionaries of France, to bring down the legitimate governments of Europe; these conspirators were attempting to overturn traditional society by "endeavouring to infect the minds of the rising generation, through the medium of ''Books of Education'' and ''Children's Books''" (emphasis Trimmer's).<ref>Trimmer, Sarah. ''The Guardian of Education''. Bristol: Thoemmes Press (2002), 1:2, 10, 81, 145.</ref> Her views were shaped by Abbé Barruel's ''Memoirs, Illustrating the History of Jacobinism'' (1797-8) (she extracted large sections from this text into the ''Guardian'' itself) but also by her fears of the ongoing wars between France and Britain during the 1790s.<ref>Cutt, Margaret Nancy. ''Ministering Angels: A Study of Nineteenth-century Evangelical Writing for Children''. Wormley: Five Owls Press (1979), 8.</ref> Trimmer emphasized Christianity above all in her writings and maintained that one should to turn to God in times of trial. As M. Nancy Cutt argues in her book on children's literature, Trimmer and writers like her "claimed emphatically that the degree of human happiness was in direct proportion to the degree of submission of the divine Will. Thus they repudiated the moralists’ view that learning should exalt reason and work to the temporal happiness of the individual, which was governed by the best interests of society.”<ref>Cutt, 9.</ref> Trimmer and her allies contended that French pedagogical theories led to an immoral nation, that is, "deism, infidelity and revolution."<ref>Cutt, 17.</ref>

===Bell vs. Lancasterian school system debate===
In 1789, [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] invented the [[Bell-Lancaster method|Madras]] system of education to order to instruct British colonial subjects in [[India]]; it was a disciplinary system which employed a hierarchy of student monitors and very few teachers (economical for the colonies, Bell argued). He published a book, ''Experiment in Education'' (1797), in order to explain his system, one that he thought could be adapted for the poor in England. A year after reading the ''Experiment'', an English [[Quaker]], [[Joseph Lancaster]], adopted many of its principles for his school in London and then published his own book, ''Improvements in Education'' (1803), which repeated many of Bell's ideas. Because of his Quaker sympathies, Lancaster did not encourage the teaching of the doctrines of Britain's [[Anglicanism|Established Church]].<ref>Darton, F. J. Harvey. ''Children’s Books in England: Five Centuries of Social Life''. 3rd ed. Revised by Brian Alderson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1982), 159-60.</ref> Trimmer, appalled by the suggestion that British children did not need to be brought up within the Established Church, wrote and published her ''Comparative View'' of the two systems in 1805, creating a schism between two very similar systems. According to F. J. Harvey Darton, an early scholar of children's literature, “her effect upon English education . . . was very considerable, even extraordinary. The two rival systems, Bell’s and Lancaster’s, were hotly debated all over the country, and the war between Bell and the Dragon, as a cartoonist labelled it, raged in all the magazines, even in the ''Edinburgh Review''."<ref>Darton, 160.</ref> Out of the debate “arose the two great societies – the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Children of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church, and the British and Foreign School Society – upon whose work, fundamentally, the whole of [Britain's] later elementary school system was based."<ref>Darton, 160.</ref>

==Death==
Trimmer's husband died in 1792. A few years later, in 1800, she and some of her daughters moved to another house in [[Brentford]] where she died on [[December 15]], [[1810]]. She was buried at St Mary's, Ealing. There is a plaque memorializing her at St. George's, Brentford:
<blockquote>To the memory of SARAH relict of James Trimmer, resident in this parish nearly 50 years, during which she adorned the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things, by her practice a constant attendant in God’s House of Prayer. In her own house an example to Christian Matrons, in her neighbourhood ministering to the necessities of all; the destitute, the afflicted and the ignorant, seeking their moral improvement by imparting Christian instruction both in private and also in the Church School raised by her exertions and fostered by her care. By her writings, edifying the members of that branch of Christ’s Holy Church in which she was born and which she loved with an ardent but well tempered zeal. She obtained rest from her labours on the 15th December 1810 in the seventieth year of her age.<ref>Yarde, 29.</ref>
</blockquote>

==Reception and legacy==
Trimmer's most popular book, ''Fabulous Histories'', was reprinted for at least 133 years and had a profound impact on generations of readers and writers.<ref>Cosslett, 33.</ref> In 1877, when the firm of Griffith and Farran published it as part of their "Original Juvenile Library," they advertised it as "the delicious story of Dicksy, Flapsy, and Pecksy, who can have forgotten it? It is as fresh today as it was half a century ago."<ref>Qtd. in Cosslett, 37.</ref> Tess Cosslett has also suggested that the names of Trimmer's birds—Dicksy, Pecksy, Flapsy and Robin—bear a striking resemblance to the rabbits—Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter—in [[Beatrix Potter]]'s children's books.<ref>Cosslett, 37.</ref> Trimmer also influenced the children's writers of her age; [[William Godwin|William Godwin's]] ''Fables, Ancient and  Modern'' (1805), for example, imitates Trimmer's ''Ladder to Learning''.<ref>Ruwe, 4.</ref> 

But while Trimmer was highly respected for her charity work during her lifetime and for her books long after her death, her reputation began to wane at the end of the nineteenth century and finally plummeted during the twentieth century. One of the first scholars of children's literature, Geoffrey Summerfield, describes her this way: “Of all the morally shrill women active in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, she was probably the shrillest. Unbalanced, frenetic, paranoid, she may have been, but no one could deny her energy and perseverance in defending the souls of the children of England from the assaults of the devil.”<ref>Summerfield, 188.</ref> Recently, though, children's literature scholars have attempted to view eighteenth-century children's literature within its historical context rather than judge it against modern tastes, and scholars such as Grenby, Ruwe, Ferguson, Fyfe and Coslett have reassessed Trimmer's work. Also, because Trimmer does not fit the mold of twentieth-century feminism, that is, she did not rebel against the social mores of her society like [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], she has not immediately drawn the attention of feminist scholars. But, as Ruwe points out, “by the confluence of political, historical, and pedagogical events at the turn of the century, a woman such as Trimmer was able to gain a greater visibility in the realm of public letters than was perhaps typical before or after;”<ref>Ruwe, 3.</ref> Trimmer was a "role model for other women authors" and these later authors often acknowledged their debt explicitly, as did the author of ''The Footsteps to Mrs. Trimmer’s Sacred History''."<ref>Ruwe, 14.</ref>
