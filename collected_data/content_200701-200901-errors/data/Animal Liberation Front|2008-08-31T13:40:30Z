The '''Animal Liberation Front''' (ALF) is a name used internationally by [[Animal rights|animal liberation]] activists who engage in [[direct action]] on behalf of animals. This includes removing animals from laboratories and fur farms, and [[sabotage|sabotaging]] facilities involved in [[animal testing]] and other animal-based industries. According to ALF statements, any act that furthers the cause of [[Animal rights|animal liberation]], where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm any animal human or otherwise, may be claimed as an ALF action.<ref name=Best8>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] & Nocella, Anthony J. (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'', [[Lantern Books]], 2004, p. 8.</ref>

The ALF is not a group with a membership, but an example of a [[leaderless resistance]], a banner for activists to use. ALF volunteers see themselves as the modern equivalent of the [[Underground Railroad]], the 19th-century anti-slavery network, with activists removing animals from laboratories and farms, arranging safe houses and veterinary care, and operating sanctuaries where the animals live out the rest of their lives.<ref>*[[Rod Coronado|Coronado, Rod]].

Activists who speak on behalf of the ALF say the movement is non-violent. In ''[[Behind the Mask (ALF)|Behind the Mask]]'', a 2006 documentary, American activist [[Rod Coronado]] said: "One thing that I know that separates us from the people we are constantly accused of being &mdash; that is, terrorists, violent criminals &mdash; is the fact that we have harmed no one."<ref name=Mask>''[[Behind the Mask (ALF)|Behind the Mask: The Story Of The People Who Risk Everything To Save Animals]]'', a film by [[Shannon Keith]], 2006.</ref> There has nevertheless been widespread criticism that ALF spokespersons and activists have either failed to condemn acts of violence or have themselves engaged in it. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), which monitors U.S. domestic extremism, has noted the involvement of ALF activists in the [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] campaign, which SPLC identifies as using "frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists,"<ref name=SPLC2002>[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From Push to Shove"], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] Intelligence Report, Fall 2002.</ref> and in January 2005, the ALF was listed in a draft planning document as a domestic terrorist group by the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]].<ref>Rood, Justin.

==Origins==
{{see|Animal liberation movement#History|Brown Dog Affair|Direct action|Fox hunting|Hunt Saboteurs Association|Ronnie Lee}}
===Band of Mercy===
Noel Molland writes that the ideas behind the ALF can be traced to 19th century England and a small group of activists from the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA).<ref name=Molland68>Molland, Neil. "Thirty Years of Direct Action" in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters'', Lantern Books, 2004, p. 68.</ref>

In 1824, Catherine Smithies, an anti-[[slavery]] activist, set up an RSPCA youth wing called the Bands of Mercy, a children's club modeled on the [[Temperance movement|Temperance Society's]] Bands of Hope, which were aimed at getting children to campaign against drinking. The Bands of Mercy were intended to encourage children to love animals, although some of its members reportedly responded with more enthusiasm than the RSPCA intended, and became known for engaging in [[direct action]] against hunters by sabotaging their rifles.<ref>Molland, Neil. "Thirty Years of Direct Action" in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters'', Lantern Books, 2004, p. 68. Kim Stallwood of the Animal Rights Network writes he has often heard these stories but has never been able to find solid evidence to support them (Stallwood, Kim. "A Personal Overview of Direct Action" in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 82).</ref>
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RonnieLeeALF.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Ronnie Lee]] founded the Band of Mercy in 1971, which became the ALF in 1976.]]  -->
In December 1963, John Prestige, a journalist from [[Brixham]], [[Devon]], revived the idea of organized direct action against hunts after he was assigned to cover a Devon and Somerset Staghounds event, where he watched hunters chase and kill a pregnant deer.<ref name=Best19>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 19.</ref><ref name=Ryder167>Ryder, Richard. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 167.</ref> Prestige decided to form the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] (HSA) &mdash; with the support of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]], according to ''The Guardian'' &mdash; which evolved into groups of trained volunteers all over England who would thwart hunts by blowing horns and laying false scents to confuse the hounds.<ref>[http://www.huntsab.org/history.htm "The History of the Hunt Saboteurs Association (Part 1)"], American Hunt Saboteurs Association, accessed March 1, 2008. See also [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/jul/29/hunting.animalwelfare "Losing the Scent"], Letters to the Editor, ''The Guardian'', July 29, 2004.</ref>

Molland writes that one of these HSA groups was led by a law student, [[Ronnie Lee]], who formed his group in [[Luton]] in 1971. In 1972, Lee and a fellow activist, Cliff Goodman, decided more militant tactics were needed to stop hunts from ever starting, rather than simply diverting the dogs. They revived the name of the 19th-century RSPCA youth group, and set up the Band of Mercy, which attacked hunters' vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows. The group called their form of activism "active compassion." Volunteers left notes on the vehicles explaining why they had been attacked, assuring the hunters that the attacks were not personal.<ref name=Molland68>Molland, Neil. "Thirty Years of Direct Action" in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 68.</ref>

====First acts of arson====
In 1973, the Band of Mercy learned that Hoechst Pharmaceuticals was building a new research laboratory near [[Milton Keynes]], not far from the Band's Luton base. It decided to expand its activities and destroy the lab before it could be completed. On [[November 10]], [[1973]], two activists set fire to the building, causing £26,000 worth of damage, and returning six days later to set fire to what was left of it. It was the animal liberation movement's first known act of arson. The Band claimed responsibility in a message to the press, identifying itself as a "nonviolent guerilla organization dedicated to the liberation of animals from all forms of cruelty and persecution at the hands of  mankind."<ref name=Molland70>Molland, Neil. "Thirty Years of Direct Action" in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, pp. 70-74.</ref>

In June 1974, two Band of Mercy activists set fire to boats licensed by the Home Office to take part in the annual [[Seal hunting|seal cull]] off the Norfolk coast, which Molland writes was the last time the cull took place. Between June and August 1974, it launched eight raids against animal-testing laboratories, and others against chicken breeders and gun shops, either damaging buildings or vehicles. Its first act of "animal liberation" took place during the same period, when activists removed half a dozen guinea pigs from a guinea pig farm in [[Wiltshire]], which resulted in the owner closing her business, fearing further attacks.<ref name=Molland70/>

Then as now, the use of arson caused a split within the fledgling animal liberation movement. In July 1974, the Hunt Saboteurs Association offered a £250 reward for information leading to the identification of the Band of Mercy, telling the press, "We approve of their ideals, but are opposed to their methods."<ref name=Molland70/>

====ALF formed====
{{rquote|right|''Labs raided, locks glued, products spiked, depots ransacked, windows smashed, construction halted, mink set free, fences torn down, cabs burnt out, offices in flames, car tires slashed, cages emptied, phone lines severed, slogans daubed, muck spread, damage done, electrics cut, site flooded, hunt dogs stolen, fur coats slashed, buildings destroyed, foxes freed, kennels attacked, businesses burgled, uproar, anger, outrage, balaclava clad thugs. It's an ALF thing!'' &mdash; [[Keith Mann]]<ref name=Mann55>[[Keith Mann|Mann, Keith]]. ''From Dusk Till Dawn''. Puppy Pincher Press, 2007, p. 55.</ref>}}
[[Image:ALF logo.svg|left|thumb|120px|The ALF logo with an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] circle-A.]]
In August 1974, Lee and Goodman were arrested for taking part in a raid on Oxford Laboratory Animal Colonies in [[Bicester]], earning them the moniker, the "Bicester Two." Daily demonstrations took place outside the court during their trial, and included Lee's local Labour MP, [[Ivor Clemitson]].

They were sentenced to three years in prison, during which Lee went on the movement's first [[hunger strike]] in order to obtain [[vegan]] food and clothing. They were paroled after 12 months, with Lee emerging more militant than ever. In 1976, he organized the remaining Band of Mercy activists and gathered two dozen new recruits, 30 activists in all.<ref name=Monaghan160>Monaghan, Rachael. "Terrorism in the Name of Animal Rights," in Taylor, Maxwell and Horgan, John. ''The Future of Terrorism''. Routledge 2000, pp. 160-161.</ref>

Molland writes that the Band of Mercy name sounded wrong as a description of what Lee saw as a revolutionary movement. Lee wanted a name that would, Molland writes, "haunt" those who used animals. Thus, the Animal Liberation Front was born.<ref name=Molland70/>

{{cquote|ALF activists operate under cover, at night, wearing [[balaclava]]s and ski masks, and in small cells of a few people. After careful [[reconnaissance]], skilled liberation teams break into buildings housing animal prisoners in order to release them (e.g. [[mink]] and [[coyote]]s) or rescue them (e.g. cats, dogs, mice, and guinea pigs). They seize and/or destroy equipment, property, and materials used to exploit animals, and they use [[arson]] to raze buildings and laboratories. They have cost the animal exploitation industries hundreds of millions of dollars. They willfully break the law, because the law wrongly consigns animals to cages and confinement, to loneliness and pain, to torture and death.|[[Steven Best]], ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, p. 11.}}

Volunteers are expected to stick to the ALF's stated aims when using its banner. Any direct action that contradicts these aims &mdash; and in particular the provision not to harm human or non-human life &mdash; may not be claimed as an ALF act:

The provision against physical violence has triggered allegations of hypocrisy from the ALF's critics, and bitter divisions within the movement about its meaning and importance. Steven Best and [[Jerry Vlasak]], a California trauma surgeon who also volunteers for the North American press office, have both been banned from entering the UK after making statements that appeared to support violence.<ref>MacLeod, Donald.

The nature of the ALF as a leaderless resistance means there is no way to gauge how much support Vlasak's position has with activists.

===Above-ground supporters and publications===

{{see|Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group|Animal Liberation Press Office|Arkangel (magazine)|Bite Back|No Compromise (magazine)|Vegan Prisoners Support Group}}
Although the ALF has no formal existence, a number of "above ground" groups exist to support volunteers and to publicize the direct action.

The [[Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group]] (ALF SG) adopts volunteers in jail as "[[Prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]]," writing to them or sending supplies. Anyone can join the ALF SG, which is based in London, for £2 a month.<ref>[http://www.alfsg.org.uk Animal Liberation Supporters Group website]</ref> Another group, the [[Vegan Prisoners Support Group]], created in 1994 when [[Keith Mann]] was first jailed, works with prison authorities in the UK to ensure that jailed activists have access to [[vegan]] food and toiletries.<ref>[http://www.vpsg.org Vegan Prisoners Support Group]</ref><ref>[http://www.ppo.gov.uk/download/199-059OnTheCase16.pdf "On the Case"], Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, p. 5.</ref>

The Animal Liberation Press Office receives and publicizes anonymous communiqués, including claims of responsibility.<ref>[http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org Animal Liberation Press Office].</ref> It operates as an independent organization funded by public donations, although a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge in England ruled in 2006 that it was "not a neutral reporting exercise or even simply a vehicle for apologists for the ALF, but a vital part of the ALF's strategy."<ref name=Ananova>[http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2034635.html?menu "Oxford wins protest injunction case"], ''Ananova'', originally in ''The Guardian'', October 13, 2006, retrieved March 13, 2008.</ref>

There are three publications associated with the ALF. ''[[Arkangel (magazine)|Arkangel]]'' is a British-based bi-annual magazine founded by Ronnie Lee and sold internationally. ''[[Bite Back]]'' is both a magazine and a website, where activists leave claims of responsibility.<ref>[http://www.directaction.info "Bite Back"]. In 2005, it published a "Direct Action Report," stating that, in 2004, ALF activists removed 17,262 animals from facilities, and claimed 554 acts of sabotage, vandalism, and arson (see [http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_america_updates/movements/ecoterrorism/eco050125.htm "Radical animal rights magazine issues 2004 'Direct Action' report"], ''Law Enforcement Agency Resource Network'', January 25, 2005).</ref> ''[[No Compromise (magazine)|No Compromise]]'' is a San Francisco-based website that also reports on ALF actions.

===Philosophy of direct action===
{{see|Abolitionism (animal rights)|Animal rights}}
{{rquote|right|''[W]e all desperately want to fight animal abuse legally. It just doesn't work like that. The people who run this country, they have shares, they have investments in pharmaceutical companies, for example, who are experimenting on animals, so to think that you can write to these people, and say "we don't like what you're doing, we want you to change," and expect them to do so, it's not going to happen.'' &mdash; [[Keith Mann]].<ref name=Keith>[[Shannon Keith|Keith, Shannon]]. ''Behind the Mask'', Uncaged Films, 2006.</ref>}}
ALF activists believe that animals should not be regarded as property, and that scientists and industry have no right to assume ownership of living beings who are each, in the words of philosopher [[Tom Regan]], the "[[Subject (philosophy)|subject-of-a-life]]."<ref>Regan, Tom. ''The Case for Animal Rights''. University of California Press, 1983.</ref> In the view of the ALF, to fail to recognize this is [[speciesism]] &mdash; the ascription of different values to beings on the basis of their species membership alone &mdash; which they argue is as ethically flawed as racism or sexism. They reject the [[Animal welfare|animal welfarist]] position that more humane treatment is needed for animals; they say their aim is empty cages, not bigger ones. Activists argue that the animals they remove from laboratories or farms are "liberated," not "stolen," because they were never rightfully owned in the first place.<ref name=Best24>>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. "Introduction," in Best and Nocella. (eds.) ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?''. Lantern Books, 2004, pp. 24-26.</ref> 

Although the ALF rejects physical violence, many activists deny that attacks on property count as violent action, comparing the destruction of animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up [[gas chamber]]s in [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=Bernstein>Bernstein, Mark. "Legitimizing Liberation," in Best and Nocella. ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?''. Lantern Books, 2004, p. 91.</ref> Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly to the point of making [[Animal testing|animal research]] prohibitively expensive. This, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the [[University of Arizona]] told ''No Compromise'' in 1996: "[I]t is much the same thing as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ... Sometimes when you just take animals and do nothing else, perhaps that is not as strong a message."<ref name=McClain>McClain, Carla. "ALF: A Secret Interview with a Compassionate Companion," ''No Compromise'', March-April 1996, p. 12, cited in Schnurer, Maxwell. "At the Gates of Hell," in Best and Nocella, ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'', 2004, pp. 115-116.</ref>

[[Peter Singer]], professor of bioethics at [[Princeton University]], has argued that ALF direct action can only be regarded as a just cause if non-violent, and that the ALF is at its most effective when uncovering evidence of animal abuse that other tactics probably could not expose.<ref>Singer, Peter. ''Animal Liberation'', cited in >[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. "Introduction," in Best and Nocella. (eds.) ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?''. Lantern Books, 2004, p. 28.</ref> He cites as an example the [[Unnecessary Fuss|ALF raid on the University of Pennsylvania]] head-injury research clinic in 1984, during which footage shot by the researchers was removed, showing them laughing at conscious [[baboon]]s as severe brain damage was inflicted on them. The university responded that the treatment of the animals conformed to [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) guidelines,<ref name=Orlans71>F. Barbara Orlans. ''The Human Use of Animals: Case Studies in Ethical Choice''. Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 71-76.</ref> but as a result of the publicity, the lab was closed down, the chief veterinarian fired, and the university placed on probation.<ref>Carbone, Larry.

Against this, [[Steven Best]] writes that industries and governments have too much institutional and financial bias for reason to prevail.<ref name=Best29>>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]].

Peter Hughes of the [[University of Sunderland]] cites a 1988 raid led by [[Barry Horne]] as an example of positive ALF direct action. Horne and four other activists decided to free Rocky the dolphin, who had lived in a small concrete pool in Marineland in [[Brighton]] for 20 years, by moving him 200 yards from his pool to the sea, using a ladder, a home-made stretcher, and a hired [[Mini Metro]].<ref>[http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2001/11/8/649628.html "Animal rights man dies on hunger strike"], ''Lancashire Evening Telegraph'', November 8, 2001.</ref><ref name=Arkangel>[http://web.archive.org/web/20030212174035/http://arkangelweb.org/barry/barry.shtml "Barry's life"], ''Arkangel'', undated.</ref> They were spotted by police with the dolphin stretcher for which, as one of the activists put it, "we had no legitimate explanation."<ref name=Mann163/> They were convicted of conspiracy to steal, but continued to campaign for Rocky's release.

{{Main|Timeline of Animal Liberation Front actions, 1976-1999}}
===Early tactics and public response===
Rachel Monaghan of the [[University of Ulster]] writes that, in their first year of operation alone, ALF actions accounted for £250,000 worth of damage, targeting butchers shops, furriers, circuses, slaughterhouses, breeders, and fast-food restaurants. She writes that the ALF philosophy was that "violence" can only take place against [[Sentience|sentient]] life forms, and therefore focusing on property destruction and the removal of animals from laboratories and farms was consistent with a philosophy of non-violence, despite the damage they were causing.<ref name=Monaghan160/> Writing in 1974, Ronnie Lee was insistent that direct action be "limited only by reverence of life and hatred of violence,"<ref>[[Ronnie Lee|Lee, Ronnie]]. ''Peace News'' 1974, cited in Stallwood, Kim. "A Personal Overview of Direct Action" in Best and Nocella. (eds.) ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'' Lantern Books, 2004, p. 83.</ref> and in 1979, he wrote that many ALF raids had been called off because of the risk to life.<ref>[[Ronnie Lee|Lee, Ronnie]] and Treadwell, Gary in ''Freedom'' 1979, cited in Stallwood, Kim. "A Personal Overview of Direct Action" in Best and Nocella (eds.). ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'' Lantern Books, 2004, p. 83.</ref>

Kim Stallwood writes that the public's response to early ALF raids that removed animals was very positive, in large measure because of the non-violence policy. When Mike Huskisson removed three beagles from a tobacco study at [[ICI]] in June 1975, the media portrayed him as something of a hero.<ref name=Stallwood83/><ref>[http://www.acigawis.co.uk/press_gallery1.htm "The man who hounds the huntsmen"], ''St Neots Advertiser'', December 24, 1975.</ref><!--an image that was tarnished in January 1977, when Huskisson and two other ALF activists desecrated the grave and smashed the headstone of Robert Peel, a huntsman who had been dead for 123 years. Police found a stuffed fox's head in the grave. The activists were sentenced to nine months imprisonment.<ref>Henshaw, David. ''Animal Warfare''.

So there was a bit of manipulation of the tabloid media and to "give ‘em what they want" sort of thing." Commented out last part for now because I can't find a second source for it and haven't seen the Henshaw book myself.--> Robin Webb writes that ALF volunteers were viewed as the "[[Robin Hood]]s of the animal welfare world."<ref>Webb, Robin. "Animal Liberation &mdash; By 'Whatever Means Necessary'," in Best and Nocella. (eds.) ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 77.</ref>

This glamorization of the movement attracted a new breed of activist, Stallwood writes. They were younger, often unemployed, and more interested in [[anarchism]] than in animal liberation ''per se'', seeing it as part of their opposition to the state, rather than as an end in itself. According to Stallwood, these new activists did not want to adhere to non-violence.<ref name=Stallwood83>Stallwood, Kim. "A Personal Overview of Direct Action" in Best and Nocella (eds.).

===ALF SG and its relationship with the BUAV===
{{see|Roger_Yates#BUAV}}
In the early 1980s, the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]], a respected anti-vivisection group founded by [[Frances Power Cobbe]] in 1898, was a strong supporter of the ALF. Kim Stallwood was BUAV's national organizer from 1981-1986. He writes that the BUAV donated part of its office space rent-free to the [[ALFSG|ALF Supporters Group]], which included Ronnie Lee, and gave ALF actions uncritical publicity in its newspaper, ''The Liberator''.

Despite the support, it became clear that the ALF SG, with its new anarchist membership, was attempting to take over the board of the BUAV. Stallwood writes that, as anarchists, they believed all political action to be a waste of time, and wanted the BUAV to devote its resources exclusively to direct action. Whereas the earliest activists had been committed to rescuing animals and destroying property only where the latter contributed to the former, by the mid-1980s, he believed the ALF had lost its ethical foundation, and had become "an opportunity for misfits and misanthropes" to "seek personal revenge for some perceived social injustice."<ref name=Stallwood85>Stallwood, Kim. "A Personal Overview of Direct Action" in Best and Nocella (eds.). ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'' Lantern Books, 2004, pp. 85-87.</ref> He writes: "Where was the intelligent debate about tactics and strategies that went beyond the mindless rhetoric and emotional elitism pervading much of the self-produced direct action literature? In short, what had happened to the animals' interests?"<ref name=Stallwood85/>

In 1984, the BUAV board reluctantly voted to expel the ALF SG from its premises and withdraw its political support, after which, Stallwood writes, the ALF became increasingly isolated.<ref name=Stallwood85/>

===The emergence of a violent faction===
Monaghan writes that, around 1982, there was a noticeable shift in the non-violent position, and not one approved by everyone in the movement. Some activists began to make personal threats against individuals, followed by letter bombs and threats to contaminate food, the latter representing yet another shift to threatening the general public, rather than specific targets.<ref name=Monaghan160/><!--Add from 1996 onwards strategy of targeting animal-testing suppliers; secondary and tertiary targeting. Barry Horne, ARM, hunger strikes.-->

In 1982, letter bombs were sent to all four major party leaders, including the prime minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]]. In November 1984, the first major food scare was carried out, with the ALF claiming in phone calls and letters to the media that it had contaminated [[Mars Bar]]s &mdash; part of a campaign to force the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars company]] to stop conducting [[tooth decay]] tests on monkeys.<ref>[http://www.marscandykills.com/experiments.asp Website of PETA's campaign against Mars], accessed March 5, 2008.</ref> On November 17, the ''Sunday Mirror'' received a call from the ALF saying it had injected Mars Bars in stores throughout the country with [[rat poison]]. The call was followed by a letter containing a Mars Bar, presumed to be contaminated, and the claim that these were on sale in London, Leeds, York, Southampton, and Coventry. Millions of bars were removed from shelves and Mars halted production, at a cost to the company of $4.5 million.<ref name=Hansard>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/nov/19/confectionery-poisoning "Confectionery (Poisoning)"], ''Hansard'', November 19, 1984.</ref><ref>Schweitzer, Glenn E. and Dorsch Schweitzer, Carole.

====Animal Rights Militia====
{{see|Animal Rights Militia|Justice Department (animal rights)}}
[[Image:Animalrightsmilitia.gif|right|frame|The [[Animal Rights Militia]] is a banner used by activists who do not abide by the ALF's policy not to endanger life.<ref name=WebbARM/>]]
The letter bombs to politicians were claimed by the Animal Rights Militia (ARM).<ref name=Mann497>[[Keith Mann|Mann, Keith]]. ''From Dusk 'til Dawn: An insider's view of the growth of the Animal Liberation Movement,''. Puppy Pincher Press, 2007, p. 497.</ref> The Mars Bar hoax is now also attributed by newspapers to the ARM, although the initial report by [[David Mellor]], then a Home Office minister, to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[November 19]], [[1984]] was clear that it was the Animal Liberation Front who had claimed responsibility.<ref name=Hansard/> This is an early example of the shifting of responsibility from one banner to another, depending on the nature of the act, with the ARM and another ''[[nom de guerre]]'', the [[Justice Department (animal rights)|Justice Department]] &mdash; the latter first used in 1993 &mdash; emerging as names that activists used for direct action that failed the ALF's "no harm to living beings" principle. Ronnie Lee, who had earlier insisted on the importance of the ALF's non-violence policy, seemed to support the idea. An article signed by RL &mdash; presumed to be Ronnie Lee &mdash; in the October 1984 [[ALFSG|ALF Supporters Group]] newsletter, suggested that activists set up "fresh groups ... under new names whose policies do not preclude the use of violence toward animal abusers."<ref name=Stallwood84>Stallwood, Kim. "A Personal Overview of Direct Action" in Best and Nocella (eds.). ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'' Lantern Books, 2004, p. 84.</ref>

No activist is known to have conducted operations under both the ALF and ARM banners, but overlap is nevertheless assumed. [[Paul Wilkinson (professor)|Paul Wilkinson]], a terrorism expert, has written that the ALF, the Justice Department, and the ARM are essentially the same,<ref name=WilkinsonHansard>''Hansard'', December 14, 1992, column 223.</ref> and Robert Garner of the [[University of Leicester]] writes that it would be pointless to argue otherwise, given the nature of the movement as a leaderless resistance. Robin Webb of the British Animal Liberation Press Office has acknowledged that the activists may be the same people: "If someone wishes to act as the Animal Rights Militia or the Justice Department, simply put, the ... policy of the Animal Liberation Front, to take all reasonable precautions not to [[Endangerment|endanger]] life, no longer applies."<ref name=WebbARM>[http://www.nocompromise.org/issues/22robin.html "Staying on Target and Going the Distance: An Interview with U.K. A.L.F.

From 1983 onwards, a series of fire bombs exploded in department stores that sold fur, with the intention of triggering the [[sprinkler]] systems in order to cause damage, although several stores were partly or completely destroyed.<ref>''The Times'', December 21, 1988 and February 24, 1989, and Henshaw, David.

Manchester University Press, 2004, p. 235.</ref> In September 1985, [[incendiary device]]s were placed under the cars of Dr. Sharat Gangoli and Dr. Stuart Walker, both animal researchers with the British Industrial Biological Research Association (BIBRA), wrecking both vehicles but with no injuries, and with the ARM claiming responsibility. In January 1986, the ARM said it had placed devices under the cars of four employees of [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], timed to explode an hour apart from each other. A further device was placed under the car of Dr. Andor Sebesteny, a researcher for the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] which he spotted before it was able to explode.<ref name=Mann497/>

====Leaderless resistance and the danger of false flags====
{{see|Leaderless resistance|False flag|Plausible deniability}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:HeadleycarJune1990.jpg|right|thumb|250px|On [[June 10]], [[1990]], a bomb containing [[plastic explosive]]s rolled out of University of Bristol researcher Max Headley's car, exploding on the road next to it, and injuring a child passing by in a stroller. No one claimed responsibility, but the ALF was widely blamed.<ref>Senior, Kathryn. "Defending the use of animals to research human disease," ''Molecular Medicine Today'', Volume 1, Issue 5, August 1995, p. 223.</ref><ref name=Vines/>]] -->

In February 1989, an explosion damaged the Senate House bar at [[Bristol University]], an attack claimed by the unknown "Animal Abused Society." In June 1990, two days apart, bombs exploded in the cars of Margaret Baskerville, a veterinary surgeon working at [[Porton Down]], a chemical research defence establishment, and Patrick Max Headley, a psychologist at Bristol University. Baskerville escaped without injury on June 9 by jumping through the window of her mini-jeep when a bomb using a [[Mercury switch|mercury-tilt device]] exploded next to the fuel tank. During the attack on Headley on Sunday, June 10, which ''New Scientist'' writes involved the use of [[plastic explosive]]s, a 13-month-old baby passing by in a stroller was seriously injured with reported flash burns, a partially severed finger, and [[shrapnel]] wounds to his back.<ref name=Garner235>Garner, Robert.

No known name claimed responsibility for the attacks on Baskerville and Headley, which were condemned within the animal rights movement and by ALF activists. Keith Mann writes that it didn't seem plausible that activists known for making simple [[incendiary device]]s from household components would suddenly switch to mercury-tilt switches and plastic explosives, then never be heard from again.<ref name=Mann157>[[Keith Mann|Mann, Keith]]. ''From Dusk Till Dawn''. Puppy Pincher Press, 2007, pp. 157-158.</ref>

A few days after the bombings, the unknown "British Animal Rights Society" claimed responsibility for having attached a nail bomb to a huntsman's Land Rover in Somerset. Forensic evidence led police to arrest the owner of the vehicle, who admitted he had bombed his own car to discredit the animal rights movement, and asked for two similar offences to be taken into consideration. He was jailed for nine months. The Baskerville and Headley bombers were never apprehended, and although many in the movement believe they were [[false flag]] operations &mdash; operations conducted by ''[[Agent provocateur|agents provocateur]]'' to discredit the ALF &mdash; no evidence of that ever emerged.<ref name=Mann157/> 

The incidents underline the risk and uncertainty of working as a leaderless resistance, which sees the ALF name exposed to actions carried out by activists not fully committed to the ALF's non-violent platform, and possibly by opponents intent on making the ALF look as violent as possible. That same uncertainty also provides genuine ALF activists with [[plausible deniability]] should an operation go wrong, by denying that the act was "authentically ALF."<ref>>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]].

===Development of the ALF in the U.S.===

There are conflicting accounts of when the ALF first emerged in the United States.

The FBI writes that animal rights activists had a history of committing "low-level criminal activity" in the U.S. dating back to the 1970s.<ref name=FBI>[http://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.htm#page_35 Trends in Animal Rights and Environmental Extremism"], Terrorism 2000/2001", Federal Bureau of Investigation.</ref> Freeman Wicklund and Kim Stallwood say the first ALF action there was on [[May 29]], [[1977]], when researchers Ken LeVasseur and Steve Sipman released two dolphins, Puka and Kea, into the ocean at Yokohama Bay, [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]], from captivity in the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Marine Mammal Laboratory.<ref name=Best21>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 21.</ref><ref>Vorsino, Mary.

The North American Animal Liberation Press Office attributes the dolphin release to a group called Undersea Railroad, and says the first ALF action was, in fact, a raid on the New York University Medical Center on [[March 14]], [[1979]], when activists removed one cat, two dogs, and two guinea pigs.<ref name=ALPOhistory>[http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/history.htm#guide "History of the Animal Liberation Movement"], North American Animal Liberation Press Office.</ref><ref>[http://www.animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Actions-USA/alfusa.htm "Monumental Animal Liberation Front Actions - United States"], Animal Liberation Front website.</ref>

Kathy Snow Guillermo writes in ''Monkey Business'' that the first ALF action was the removal on [[September 22]], [[1981]] of the so-called [[Silver Spring monkeys]], seventeen lab monkeys being cared for by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), after a researcher who had been working on them was arrested for alleged violations of cruelty legislation. When the court ruled that the monkeys be returned to the researcher, they mysteriously disappeared, only to reappear five days later, when activists learned that, without the monkeys, legal action against the researcher could not proceed.<ref name=Guillermo>Guillermo, Kathy Snow. ''Monkey Business'', National Press Books, pp. 69-72.</ref>
[[Image:Eyesewn.jpg|right|frame|[[Britches (monkey)|Britches]], a five-week-old [[macaque]], was left alone with his eyes sewn shut at the [[University of California, Riverside]]. In April 1985, sixteen ALF activists removed him and hundreds of other animals, releasing a [http://www.bestcyrano.org/animalsDissection2Britches.htm videotape] of their raid.]]
[[Ingrid Newkirk]], the president of PETA, writes that the first ALF cell was set up in late 1982, after a police officer she calls "Valerie" responded to the publicity triggered by the Silver Spring monkeys case, and flew to England to ask to be trained by the ALF. Posing as a reporter, she was put in touch with Ronnie Lee by Kim Stallwood, who at that time was working for the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV). Lee reportedly directed her to a training camp, where she was taught how to break into laboratories. Newkirk writes that Valerie returned to [[Maryland]], and set up an ALF cell, with the first raid taking place on [[December 24]], [[1982]] against [[Howard University]], where 24 cats were removed, some of whose back legs had been crippled.<ref>[[Ingrid Newkirk|Newkirk, Ingrid]].

Two early ALF raids led to the closure of several university studies. A raid on [[May 28]], [[1984]] on the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s head injury clinic caused $60,000 worth of damage and saw the removal of 60 hours of tapes, which showed the researchers laughing and joking as they used a hydraulic device to cause brain damage to [[baboon]]s.<ref name=Best22>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 22.</ref><ref name=Orlans71/> The tapes were turned over to PETA, who produced a 26-minute video called ''[[Unnecessary Fuss]]''. As a result of the publicity, the head injury clinic was closed, the university's chief veterinarian was fired, the university was put on probation, the administration of the program was reorganized, and new training programs for staff were instituted.<ref>McCarthy, Charles R.

As of 2008 the organization was increasingly taking protests to the homes of researchers. Tactics used have been hurling insults and writing slogans on the researchers' property.

===Extensional self-defense===
[[Image:StevenBestLondon.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Steven Best]] argues that actions carried out by "proxy agents" on behalf of animals should be regarded as "extensional self-defense."]]
Steven Best has coined the term "extensional self-defense" to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as "proxy agents."<ref name=BestLogic>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. [http://www.drstevebest.com/Essays/GapsInLogic.htm "Gaps in Logic, Lapses in Politics: Rights and Abolitionism in Joan Dunayer's Speciesism"], ''drstevebest.org''.</ref> He argues that, in carrying out acts of extensional self-defense, activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence.<ref name=BestLogic/> Extensional self-defense is justified, he writes, because animals are "so vulnerable and oppressed they cannot fight back to attack or kill their oppressors."<ref name=BestVlasak>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. [http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/Writings_Speeches/whos_afraid_of_jerry_vlasak.html "Who's Afraid of Jerry Vlasak?"], [[Animal Liberation Press Office]].</ref>

Best argues that the principle of extensional self defense mirrors the penal code statues known as the "[[necessity defense]]," which can be invoked when a defendant believes that the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm.<ref name=BestVlasak/> In testimony to the Senate in 2005, [[Jerry Vlasak]] stated that he regarded violence against Huntingdon Life Sciences as an example of extensional self-defense.<ref name=Miller>Miller, John J.

On [[January 20]], [[2006]], as part of ''[[Operation Backfire (FBI)|Operation Backfire]]'',  the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against nine American and two Canadian activists supposedly calling themselves the "family", who are alleged to have engaged in direct action in the name of the Animal Liberation Front and [[Earth Liberation Front]]. The Department of Justice called the acts examples of "domestic terrorism." Environmental and animal rights activists have referred to the legal action as the ''[[Green Scare]]''.

The incidents included arson attacks against meat-processing plants, lumber companies, a high-tension power line, and a ski center, in Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, California, and Colorado between 1996 and 2001.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2006/January/06_crm_030.html Eleven Defendants Indicted on Domestic Terrorism Charges] ''US Department of Justice'', [[January 20]], [[2006]].
