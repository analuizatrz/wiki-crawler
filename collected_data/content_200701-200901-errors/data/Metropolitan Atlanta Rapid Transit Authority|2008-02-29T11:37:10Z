The '''Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority''' or '''MARTA''' (pronounced as the name [[Marta (name)|Marta]]), is the principal [[rapid transit|rapid-transit]] system in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] and the ninth-largest in the [[United States]].  Formed in 1971, MARTA operates a network of [[bus route]]s linked to a [[heavy rail]] rapid transit system consisting of 48&nbsp;miles (77&nbsp;km) of track with 38 [[train station]]s.  MARTA operates primarily in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]] counties, with very limited bus service to [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]], and a single rail station in [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton County]] at [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]].  MARTA also operates a separate [[paratransit]] service for disabled customers.  As of 2006, the system has an average of 451,064&nbsp;passengers per day.  

A one-way [[Flat fee|flat-rate]] fare currently costs [[United States dollar|US$]]1.75 allows for free transfers from bus to rail and visa versa.  In late 2006 MARTA switched from a [[Token coin|token]]-based fare collection to a new [[smart card]] fare collection system called [[Breeze Card]].  Fare reciprocity agreements also allow for free transfer to and from other county and regional transit agencies outside of the MARTA service area. 

MARTA is unique in that it is the largest [[United States]] transit agency not to receive [[U.S. state|state]] operational funding.  The system is funded primarily by a 1% [[sales tax]] levied in its service area and passenger revenue.  MARTA is a multi-county agency operated by a [[board of directors]] appointed by the [[Atlanta, Georgia|City of Atlanta]] and Fulton and DeKalb counties, with additional seats appointed by [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]] and Clayton counties and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|State of Georgia]].  There exist several plans for the expansion of [[Heavy rail|heavy]] and [[Light rail|light]] rail service in the MARTA system; however, currently the only active project is the implementation of [[bus rapid transit]] along a single corridor.  

In recent years MARTA has been criticised for being unreliable and difficult to use and for its perceived wasteful spending.  Supporters of MARTA have been critical of the lack of state and regional financial support given to MARTA.  Neighboring counties (Cobb, Gwinnett, and Clayton) have refused MARTA service in their counties and each county now has its own independent transit system consisting of local and express bus routes, some of which connect to the MARTA system.  

==History==
[[Image:Marta plan.png|thumb|Map of the initial plan of the MARTA system from the 1970s]]
{{Main|Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority history}}
MARTA was originally proposed as a rapid transit agency for the five largest [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metropolitan Atlanta]] counties:  [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]], [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]], [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]], [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], and [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] counties.  MARTA was formed by an act of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] in 1965. In the same year, four of the five metropolitan area counties (Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett) and the [[Atlanta, Georgia|City of Atlanta]] passed a referendum authorizing participation in the system, but the referendum failed in Cobb County. Although a 1968 referendum to fund MARTA failed, in 1971, Fulton and DeKalb Counties successfully passed a 1% sales tax increase to pay for operations, while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in referendum, fearing the introduction of crime and "undesirable elements".<ref name=bullard>{{cite book| author=Bullard, R. D. et al| year=2000| title=Sprawl City: Race, Politics, and Planning in Atlanta| location=Washington, D.C.| publisher=Island Press| pages=p52-59| isbn=1-55963-790-0}}</ref>  In 1971, the agency agreed to purchase the existing, bus-only [[Atlanta Transit Company]] and on [[February 17]], [[1972]] the sale was completed for [[United States dollar|US$]]12.9&nbsp;million giving the agency control over all public transit.

Construction began on the MARTA system in 1975, with the first rail service commencing on [[June 30]], [[1979]].  The system has since built most of the proposed rail lines, as well as stations in [[Sandy Springs (MARTA station)|Sandy Springs]] and [[North Springs (MARTA station)|North Springs]] which were not included in the original plan.  The missing rail segments include a [[Tucker, Georgia|Tucker]]-North DeKalb line with service to [[Emory University]] and [[North Druid Hills, Georgia|North Druid Hills]], a Northwest line with service to [[Brookwood Hills|Brookwood]] and Northside Drive, extension of the West line to Brownlee-Boulder Park near Fairburn Road, extension of the Proctor Creek line to Perry Homes, and a branch off of the south line to [[Hapeville, Georgia|Hapeville]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/atlanta/marta-provisions.html |title=MARTA Provisions for Future Extensions |accessdate=2008-02-24 |last=Ferreira |first=Robert |publisher=world.nysubway.org }}</ref>

==MARTA system==
[[Image:MARTA Rail Map.svg||thumb|200px|left|Map of the MARTA rail system]]
MARTA is comprised of both heavy rail transit and bus transit that operate primarily within the boundaries of [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]] counties.  Exceptions to this service area include the [[Airport (MARTA station)|Airport station]] and 7&nbsp;miles (11&nbsp;km) of rail located in [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton County]]<ref name=mediakit/> and one bus route to [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]]'s Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center.<ref name=cobbpr/>  For fiscal year 2006, the average weekday ridership was 451,064. Overall for the year, bus and paratransit ridership was 69,194,285 while rail ridership was 69,209,027.<ref name=06anrep>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/about/annualreport/2006%20Annual%20Report(tabs).pdf |title=Fiscal Year 2006 Annual Report |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2006-06-30|format=PDF |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>

As of 2007 MARTA had 4729&nbsp;full and part-time employees, of whom 1,719&nbsp;are bus drivers or rail operators.<ref name=2007FR>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/about/financial/MARTA%20CAFR2007.pdf |title=Comprehensive Annual Financial Report |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2007-06-30 |format=PDF |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>  Rail and bus operators, station agents, rail maintenance technicians and many other front line support personnel are represented by [[Amalgamated Transit Union]] Local 732.

====Rolling stock====
[[Image:Marta 006.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of a MARTA CQ312 car]]
MARTA rail cars are [[air conditioning|air conditioned]] steel-wheel trains which can operate at speeds of up to 70&nbsp;[[miles per hour]].  The trains are powered by an electrified [[third rail]] and can be operated in any combination from 2 to 8 rail cars.<ref name=06finreport/>  
The MARTA rail car fleet is currently composed of three different classes of rail cars: CQ310 class (118 active cars, car numbers 101-200, 501-520, built by Franco-Belge, 1979-1982), CQ311 class (120 active cars, car numbers 201-320, built by [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], 1984-1987), and CQ312 class (100 active cars, car numbers 601-702, built by [[Ansaldobreda, S.P.A.|Breda]], 2001-2005).<ref name=railcar>{{cite web| url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/railrehab_facts.htm |title=Rail Car Rehabilitation Media Kit |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>

MARTA has entered a contract with [[Alstom]] to rebuild all CQ310 and CQ311 cars (238 Rail Cars in total).  The rehabilitated cars will feature upgraded passenger amenities and upgraded propulsion and train control hardware. The first rehabilitated cars began service [[March 12]], [[2006]]. The refurbishing program will last until 2008-2009.<ref name=railcar/>

MARTA's [[bus]] system serves a wider area than the rail system, serving areas in Fulton and DeKalb counties such as the cities of [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell]] and [[Alpharetta]] in North Fulton, along with South DeKalb.  As of 2006, MARTA has 554 [[diesel]] and [[compressed natural gas]] buses that cover 120 bus routes (including 5 blue flyer express shuttle routes<ref name=06anrep/>) which operated 25.9&nbsp;million annual vehicle miles.<ref name=06finreport>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/about/financial/FY2006%20CAFR.pdf |title=Comprehensive Annual Financial Report |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2006-06-30 |format=PDF |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>  Effective [[November 20]], [[2006]] MARTA now has one bus route providing limited service in Cobb County (Route 12 has been extended to Cobb County's Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center).<ref name=cobbpr>
{{cite press release |title=MARTA's Bus Route 12 will provide extended service to the Cumberland Mall area |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority |date=2006-11-20 |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/press_releases/rel.asp?id=179 |accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/getthere/schedules/12.htm |title=Route 12 - Howell Mill |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>  All of the MARTA bus lines feed into or intersect MARTA rail lines as well. MARTA also runs shuttles for special events, such as the [[Peachtree Road Race]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] [[baseball]] games. MARTA shuttle service is also available to [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] during the park's summer season.

In addition to the free parking adjacent to many rail stations, MARTA also operates five [[Park and ride]] lots serviced only by bus routes (Windward Parkway, Mansell Road, Stone Mountain, Barge Road, and South Fulton).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/howto/parking.htm |title=Parking Information |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>  

For some time, MARTA had "secret" bus routes in the 700 series. These routes were designed to connect maids, home health care workers, and nannies from MARTA rail stations to their work sites. These routes were not officially noted in any system map except for a small footprint instructing people who needed transit service in that area to contact Customer Information.<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=Secret Bus Routes prevent Transit-borne Crime? |author=Lee Baylor |date=1996-06-12 |newsgroup=misc.transport.urban-transit |id= |url=http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.urban-transit/msg/2fdb62168f741ba0 |accessdate= 2008-02-24 }}</ref> No schedules were publicly distributed, and no information was published on the web site. In 1999, the routes were officially "declassified" and information was published. As part of system-wide service cuts, the 700 series routes were eliminated in 2002.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://itsmarta.com/about/history05.htm |title=History of MARTA - 2000-Present |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>

===Paratransit service===
In compliance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA), MARTA provides [[paratransit]] for those persons defined as disabled by the ADA.  MARTA uses 140 special lift equipped vehicles for this service<ref name=06finreport/> and can either deliver passengers to their final destination (curb to curb service) or can deliver the passenger to the closest accessible bus stop or rail station (feeder service).  Paratransit is limited to existing rail and bus routes and cannot extend more than a 0.75&nbsp;mile (1.2&nbsp;km) radius from any existing route. Paratransit service is only provided during the hours of the fixed route servicing the area. An application for acceptance into the paratransit service is required; reservations are required for each trip.  In fiscal year 2006 MARTA provided 289,258 paratransit trips.<ref name=06anrep/>

The average cost to MARTA for providing a one way trip for an individual paratransit passenger is [[United States dollar|US$]]31.88.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.gcdd.org/home/Plan/The%20GCDD%205%20Year%20Strategic%20Plan.rtf |title=Georgia Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities Five Year Strategic Plan |accessdate=2008-02-24 |format=RTF |publisher=Georgia Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities }}</ref> This is much greater than the [[United States dollar|US$]]3.50 fare the paratransit rider is required to pay. The Americans with Disabilities Act forbids MARTA from charging a paratransit fare more than twice the normal fixed route fare.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/printer_friendly/civil_rights_3906.html |title=Part 37--Transportation Services for Individuals with Disabilities |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2005-10-01 |publisher=Federal Transit Administration }}</ref>

A 2001 federal civil lawsuit, ''Martin v Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority'', was brought by several disabled riders who alleged MARTA was violating the ADA by failing to provide: bus schedule and route information in an accessible format, buses with working wheelchair lifts, stop announcements on rail and bus routes, and adequate staff to schedule and provide on-time paratransit service.  The district court ruled in 2002 that MARTA had violated the ADA and granted the plaintiffs an injunction requiring MARTA to improve service to the disabled.<ref>[http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/documents/1001cv3255TWTinj.pdf Martin v Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Administration], No. 1:01-CV-3255-TWT (United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia Atlanta Division).

==Fare structure and operation==
[[Image:Marta token.jpg|thumb|Example of a MARTA single one-way fare token; tokens have been replaced by MARTA's [[Breeze Card]]]]
As of January 2008 the one-way [[Flat fee|flat rate]] fare for MARTA is [[United States dollar|US$]]1.75.  However, MARTA charges a $0.50 fee for issuing new limited-use Breeze tickets.  Extended use Breeze cards are $5 and include two one-way trips.  Passengers over 65 and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] recipients are eligible to receive a discounted fare of $0.85.  A one-way paratransit fare is $3.50 (effective January 2006, disabled riders who are paratransit eligible can ride fixed bus and rail routes for free).  Ten one way trips can be purchased for $17.50, and twenty one-way trips can be purchased at a discount for $30.  MARTA also offers unlimited travel through three different pass options:  7 day pass $13, 30 day pass $52.50, and a weekend pass (Friday through Sunday) $9.  Additional discounted pass programs allow for university students and staff to purchase monthly passes for $40 and $49.50, respectively.  There are also weekly passes for [[K–12 education|K-12]] students available for $10.  Additional discounts are available to corporate partners who sell monthly MARTA passes to employees and also to groups and conventions visiting Atlanta. Some employers (at their own expense) also provide reduced cost or free MARTA passes to employees to encourage the use of public transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/howto/fares.htm |title=MARTA - Using MARTA - Fares |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>

Special routes, such as the [[Atlanta Braves]] shuttle, and the [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] shuttle service, and the [[Lakewood Amphitheatre]] (formerly HiFi Buys Amphitheatre) used to have an additional a surcharge for each one-way trip.  The surcharge was eliminated in 2007 for both the Braves shuttle and Six Flags shuttle, however a $1 surcharge remains for the Lakewood Amphitheatre shuttle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/getthere/shuttles.htm |title=MARTA Shuttles |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>


===Breeze Card===
[[Image:Happymartacards.JPG|thumb|right|Examples of MARTA Transcards (monthly and weekly), Limited Use Breeze Ticket, and Extended Use Breeze Card]]
{{main|Breeze Card}}
MARTA has finished implementing the "Breeze" [[smart card]] electronic fare collection system in September 2006, replacing the previous [[Token coin|token]]-based fare collection system.  The new Breeze Card allows riders to load money on the card for use over time, and to add weekly/monthly passes that are not fixed to a calendar period. The system uses a two card scheme: the '''Limited-Use Ticket''' is used by people who are visiting and other light users, and is composed of coated paper around the [[Radio Frequency Identification|RFID]] antenna. The '''Extended-Use Card''' is meant for those who use MARTA frequently and need to load time-based passes.  The new Breeze fare gates are designed to help prevent [[Turnstile#Turnstile jumping|fare evasion]]; with the older fare collection system fare evasion was much easier and was estimated to cost MARTA $10&nbsp;million per year.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=MARTA Plugs Gap in New Station Gates|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution  |page=4B |date=2006-02-22}}</ref> Other connecting transit systems such as [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority|GRTA Xpress]], [[Cobb Community Transit|CCT]] have adopted the infrastructure, and are currently building implementation plans.

MARTA stopped selling tokens after the Breeze conversion. Tokens are no longer accepted as payment but can be transferred to a Breeze ticket, without incurring the $0.50 fee, at a Breeze ticketing machine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breezecard.com/htm/faqs.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2008-02-25 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>

===Hours of operation===
MARTA operates 365 days a year. Rail service is provided from approximately 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Friday and 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekends and holidays, and during certain events ([[New Year's  Eve]]) trains run 24 hours.  Weekday train frequency is 10 minutes on branch lines and 5 minute frequencies on trunk lines. Late night (after 7:00 pm) and weekend frequency is reduced, with train frequencies of 15-20 minutes on all lines. Bus routes have varying frequencies depending on passenger demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/howto/hours.htm |title=Hours of Operation |accessdate=2008-02-25  |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>

===Fare reciprocity===
Through formal fare reciprocity agreements, MARTA riders are able to transfer for free to four other metro Atlanta transit systems:  [[Gwinnett County Transit]], [[Cobb Community Transit]], [[Clayton County C-TRAN]], and [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority|GRTA Xpress]]. Some of these agreements require that neither system have significantly more transfers than the other. MARTA has stated that this is the case, that inbound (to MARTA from another system) and outbound (from MARTA to another system) transfers are approximately equal (for second quarter 2006 8,888 daily passengers transferred inbound and 8,843 transferred outbound).<ref name=boardmin>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/board/minutes/Customer%20Development%203_20_2006.doc |title=Minutes of the Board of Directors Customer Development Committee |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2006-03-20 |format=DOC |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref> However, it has been noted that workers traveling in the morning to Atlanta from another system will more than likely make the return trip home, resulting in the appearance of an equal number of transfers. Analysis of morning transfers (5 to 9 am) to MARTA shows that Cobb County had 718 inbound transfers but only 528 outbound, Clayton county had 928 inbound but only 424 outbound, Gwinnett County had 239 inbound and 269 outbound, and GRTA Xpress had 1,175 inbound but 615 outbound.).<ref name=boardmin/> These data suggest that more people from the other systems benefit from free transfers than those living in the MARTA service area.

==MARTA funding==
In addition to fare collections, the MARTA budget is funded by a 1% [[sales tax]] in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]] counties along with limited [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] money.  For fiscal year 2007, MARTA had a [[farebox recovery ratio]] of 31.8%.<ref name=2007FR/>  By law, funds from the 1% sales tax must be split evenly between MARTA's operational and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] expenditure budgets. This restriction does not apply to other sources of revenue, including passenger revenue.<ref name=06martoc>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/about/MARTOC/2006MARTOCREPORT(web).pdf |title=FY06 MARTOC Report |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2006-08-15 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>  The split was written into MARTA legislation at MARTA's formation with the rationale that MARTA should continue expanding and investing in the system. However, MARTA has no active rail construction projects; as a result the capital funds enjoy a large surplus whereas the operations funds limit the amount of service MARTA provides. The sales tax law was amended by the state legislature in 2002 to allow a temporary three year 45% capital/55% operations split.<ref name=history/> This additional 5% for operations expired in 2005. A 2005 bill to renew the split was tabled by the legislature's MARTA Oversight Committee, forcing MARTA to pass a new budget with cuts in service.  The temporary 45%/55% capital/operations split was renewed again in the 2006 state legislative session. The capital funds surplus has resulted in projects, such as a new [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million [[Breeze Card]] fare collection system and [[United States dollar|US$]]1.1 million automatic [[toilet]]s in the MARTA Five Points station, occurring at the same time that MARTA is struggling to pay for bus and rail operations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=MARTA flushes in new era with 12 self-cleaning toilets |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2006-07-19 }}</ref>

The current 1% sales tax was set to be reduced to 0.5% in 2032.  In early 2007 MARTA made a request to the City of Atlanta, DeKalb County, and Fulton County to seek a 15 year extension of the 1% sales tax from 2032 to 2047, with a 0.5% sales tax from 2047 to 2057.<ref name=tax1>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=Atlanta votes to extend sales tax for MARTA |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2007-03-29 }}</ref>  This is the fourth time in its history that MARTA sought the extension, the most recent in 1990.<ref name=tax2>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=Atlanta extends MARTA sales tax to 2047:  Agency seeks extension approval from governments|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2007-03-28 }}</ref>  MARTA said the commitment to the tax is needed for the agency to secure long-term financing in the form of bonds to pay for any future expansions to the system.<ref name=tax1/> The resolution called for four new routes:  bus rapid transit from [[H.E. Holmes (MARTA station)|H.E. Holmes station]] to Fulton Industrial Boulevard, bus rapid transit from [[Garnett (MARTA station)|Garnett station]] to Stonecrest Mall, transit for the [[Belt Line (Atlanta)|Beltline]], and a direct transit link from [[Lindbergh Center (MARTA station)|Lindbergh Center]] to [[Emory University]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=Atlanta council plans special meeting for vote on MARTA tax |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2007-03-26 }}</ref>  To approve the tax extension 2 of the 3 government agencies needed to agree to the extension.  In March 2007 the City of Atlanta voted 12-1 to approve the extension.<ref name=tax1/>  In April 2007 the DeKalb County Commission also approved the sales tax extension.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=MARTA wins tax extension: Next stop could be new bus, rail lines|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2007-04-25 }}</ref>  Some Fulton county officials were opposing the sales tax extension on the basis that the proposed service expansions did not include previously proposed expansion of the North Rail line to Roswell and Alpharetta in North Fulton County.<ref name=tax3>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=Northside may balk on MARTA tax|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2007-04-04 }}</ref>  

MARTA has never received any operational funding from the State of Georgia, making it the largest public transportation agency in the United States not to receive state funding for operational expenses.<ref name=cloaf>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Wall |title=Waiting for a ride: The racial reality behind MARTA's downward spiral|url=http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A63086|work=Creative Loafing |date=2006-04-19|accessdate=2008-02-24  }}</ref>  The [[Georgia (U.S. state)|State of Georgia]] has however contributed limited funds for MARTA's capital projects (for FY 2006 this amount was less than 1 percent of the total revenue sources for capital funds).<ref name=06martoc/>

==Governance==
MARTA is a multi-county agency that is governed by a [[Board of directors]] consisting of representatives appointed from the [[Atlanta, Georgia|City of Atlanta]] (4 members), [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] (5 members), [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] (3 members), [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton County]] (1 member), and [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]] (1 member).  Additionally there are four [[ex officio]] members from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|State of Georgia]] committees (State Properties Commission & Georgia Building Authority, Georgia Department of Revenue, [[Georgia Department of Transportation]], and [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]]) who also serve on the MARTA Board of Directors.<ref name=board>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/board/meet.htm|title=Meet The Board |accessdate=2008-02-25 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>

Positions on the MARTA Board of Directors are directly appointed by the organizations they represent. Although the state of Georgia does not contribute to MARTA's operational funding, it still has voting members on the MARTA board. A similar situation exists for both Clayton and Gwinnett counties; as a consequence of passing the authorization referendum but not the funding referendum, Clayton and Gwinnett Counties have representation on the MARTA Board of Directors without paying into the system. This situation became controversial in 2004 when Gwinnett's representative Mychal Walker was found to have accepted [[United States dollar|US$]]20,000 from a lobbyist trying to secure a [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000,000 contract with MARTA. Despite the controversy, as well as a MARTA board ruling that Walker violated the MARTA ethics policy, the Gwinnett County Commission initially failed to remove Mr. Walker from his position on the MARTA Board.<ref>{{cite news |last = Hairston | first = Julie | title =  Transit board member back on job after ethics trouble; status unclear | work = Atlanta Journal-Constitution  | date = 2004-11-30}}</ref> Eventually the state legislature was called upon to change the law governing MARTA's Board to allow for the removal of a member whose appointing county did not act on a request for removal.<ref>{{cite news |last = Hairston | first = Julie | title =  MARTA seeks rules change; Board wants state to alter removal process | work = Atlanta Journal-Constitution  | date = 2004-12-07}}</ref>  Before the new law could be used, Mr. Walker was arrested on an unrelated child support violation, which resulted in his firing by the Gwinnett County Commission.<ref>{{cite news |last = Smith| first = Ben | title =  Duluth jeweler, developer named to MARTA board | work = Atlanta Journal-Constitution  | date = 2005-07-20}}</ref>

Another board member controversy occurred March 13, 2007, when [[Chair (official)|Chairman]] of the MARTA board, Edmund Wall, was arrested at [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] for [[Indecent exposure|public indecency]] on allegations of having sex in a bathroom stall with a man he met over the Internet. Wall claims he is innocent of the misdemeanor charge.<ref>{{cite news |title=MARTA Chair Arrested For Sex Acts |url=http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=93832&provider=top  |work=11 Alive |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref>  Although Wall initially said he would not resign his position, on March 16, 2007 he resigned his post as Chairman of MARTA's board of directors.<ref name= "wallstepsdown">{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Leslie |title=MARTA Chair Ed Wall Steps Down |url=http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=93946 |work=11 Alive |date=2007-03-16|accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref>  Wall has retained his position on the Board.<ref name= "wallstepsdown"/>

The highest position at MARTA is the [[General Manager]]/[[Chief Executive Officer]]. In October 2007, Dr. Beverly A. Scott was named the new General Manager.  Prior to joining MARTA, Dr. Scott served as General Manager/Chief Executive Officer of the Sacramento Regional Transit District.  She has over 30 years of experience in the transportation industry.<ref name="MARTA website">{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/about/Dr.Scott_biography.html | title=Dr. Scott's Biography | publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority| accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> Prior to Dr. Scott, MARTA's General Manager was Richard McCrillis from 2006 to 2007. In October 2007, McCrillis retired after 22 years of service at MARTA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://notify.itsmarta.com/legacy/newsletter/2007/october.html| title=MARTA Monthly MARTA Thanks General Manager Richard McCrillis for 22 Years of Dedicated Service and Leadership | publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority| date=2007-10-20 | accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

The [[Georgia General Assembly]] has a standing [[MARTA Oversight Committee]], which is frequently abbreviated MARTOC. This committee is charged with financial oversight of the MARTA organization. State legislation concerning MARTA must pass through this committee. The current chairperson of the committee is Representative Jill Chambers.

==Performance and safety==
During the 2005 fiscal year, MARTA had a [[customer satisfaction]] rate of 79%.  [[On-time performance]] for rail service was 91.64%.  The mean distance between rail service interruptions was 9,493&nbsp;miles (15,274&nbsp;km) and the mean distance between bus failures was 3,301&nbsp;miles (5,311&nbsp;km).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarta.com/about/annualreport/fy05ar.pdf |title=Fiscal Year 2005 Annual Report |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2005-06-30 |format=PDF |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref>

[[Image:Marta accident.jpg|thumb|April 2000 MARTA accident at [[Lenox (MARTA station)|Lenox station]]]]
MARTA has had two fatal accidents which resulted in a formal investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]].  On [[February 25]], [[2000]] a train near [[Avondale (MARTA station)|Avondale station]] struck two automatic train control technicians who were inspecting a relay box; one was fatally injured and the other technician suffered serious injuries.  The workers had failed to apply for a safe clearance restriction for the track work.  In addition, the rail system center controller, who was aware of the workers, failed to notify train drivers of the technicians' presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2003/RAB0303.htm |title=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) train 103 striking technicians fouling the track Near MARTA Avondale Station in Decatur, Georgia February 25, 2000 |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2003-08-08 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board }}</ref>  A second accident occurred on [[April 10]], [[2000]] when a train struck a bucket lift containing two contract workers at [[Lenox (MARTA station)|Lenox station]]; the workers were fatally injured.  Although the MARTA employee who was accompanying the workers notified the rail control center of the work over the track, the control center employee failed to block off the section of the track in the automated rail control system and also failed to notify the unscheduled southbound train of the workers presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2003/RAB0302.htm |title=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) Unscheduled train 166 striking bucket of self-propelled lift containing two contract workers MARTA Lenox rail transit station in Atlanta, Georgia April 10, 2000, about 2:30 a.m. |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2003-08-08 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board}}</ref>  In 2001 MARTA settled with the families of the two killed workers for [[United States dollar|US$]]10.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |first=Milo |last=Ippolito |title=MARTA pays $10.5 million in workers' deaths |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2001-12-05 }}</ref>

In addition to these accidents MARTA trains have derailed four times in recent years.  The most recent incident occurred at the [[Medical Center (MARTA station)|Medical Center station]] on [[December 4]], [[2006]] when a train carrying passengers was moved over a switched portion of the track.  No injuries were reported.<ref>{{cite news |last=Donsky  |coauthors=Morris |title=MARTA back on track after derailment |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2006-12-04 }}</ref>  A previous derailment occurred in July 1996 during Atlanta's hosting of the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics]].  A paired car on a train which had developed mechanical problems was uncoupled from other cars at [[Indian Creek (MARTA station)|Indian Creek station]] (the last station on the east line).  The train began rolling, crashing through the bumper at the end of the rail line and running off of the track.  The train operator, the only person on board, received minor injuries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Monroe |first=Doug |authorlink=  |title=MARTA driver injured when two cars derail|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=1996-07-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=ATLANTA DAY 7;Atlanta Train Misses Station | date=1996-07-26 | publisher= | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDD1739F935A15754C0A960958260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink | work =The New York Times | accessdate = 2008-02-09 }}</ref>  In June of 1996 a minor derailment occurred at the junction between the North and Northeast lines; MARTA estimated 150 people were aboard.<ref name=accident>{{cite news |last=Kim |first=Lilian   |title=MARTA officials say accident a 'fluke'|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=1996-06-02}}</ref>  The derailment occurred when a rail supervisor told the train driver to reverse the train after realizing the train had gone the wrong way at a track split; a MARTA investigation of the incident showed the derailment caused $125,000 of damage to the train and track and caused injury to 16 passengers.<ref>

Approximately 20 passengers were on board and no one was injured.<ref name=accident/>

On [[December 31]], [[2007]] MARTA had three separate [[escalator]] accidents that injured at least 11 people.  The incidents occurred as large crowds were going to the [[Chick-fil-A Bowl]].  Two escalators failed at [[Five Points (MARTA station)|Five Points]] station, and one escalator failed at [[Dome/GWCC/Philips Arena/CNN Center (MARTA station)|Dome/GWCC/Philips Arena/CNN Center]] station.  MARTA initially blamed the incidents on rowdy patrons jumping on the escalator.<ref>
{{cite news |last=Visser|first=Steve |title=MARTA escalator accident blamed on rowdies|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2007-12-31}}</ref> However, a subsequent formal investigation showed that the braking systems and a weak motor were to blame for the incidents.<ref>{{cite news |last=Visser|first=Steve |title=MARTA blames brakes and weak motor for escalator accidents|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2008-01-11}}</ref>

==Future expansion plans==
{{future usa public transportation}}
The last two rail stations (Sandy Springs and North Springs) were opened in 2000.  There are currently no active rail expansion projects in the MARTA system.  Currently the only active expansion in the MARTA system is the development of  [[bus rapid transit]] along [[Memorial Drive (Atlanta)|Memorial Drive]] from the former [[Avondale Mall]] to the MARTA Park and Ride Lot in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]].  This project has cleared the environmental study stage (the [[Federal Transit Administration]] issued the project a Finding of No Significant Impact in December 2006).  The project is now in the engineering design and right of acquisition phase, with an implementation of revenue service in early 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/Memorial_BRT.html  |title= Memorial Drive Arterial Bus Rapid Transit |publisger=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref>

[[Image:Beltline-breaks.png|thumb|right|Map showing Belt Line and connected [[List of Atlanta neighborhoods|neighborhoods]]; numbers represent discontinuities in current rights of way]]
Additionally, several traffic corridors are currently being studied by MARTA for possible system expansion. The [[Belt Line (Atlanta)|Belt Line]] is a current proposal for the use of light rail and possibly bus or trolley service on existing railroad right of ways inside the [[Interstate 285|perimeter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/beltline.html  |title= Beltline Corridor Details |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref>  The conversion of existing rail right-of-way to the proposed Belt Line also calls for the creation of three additional MARTA rapid transit stations where existing lines intersect the Belt Line at Simpson Road, Hulsey Yard, and Murphy Crossing.  Another proposed expansion route is a 11&nbsp;miles (18&nbsp;km) extension of heavy rail service further north from [[North Springs (MARTA station)|North Springs]] station to Windward Parkway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/northline.htm  |title= North Line (GA 400) Corridor Details|publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref> Extension of the North line is estimated to cost [[United States dollar|US$]]100&nbsp;million per mile.<ref name=tax3/>  Potential Sites (along [[GA 400|near GA 400]]) include [[Georgia State Route 140|Holcomb Bridge Road]]  in [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell]] and [[North Point Mall]], [[Georgia State Route 120|Old Milton Parkway]], and Windward Parkway in [[Alpharetta]].<ref> {{cite news |first=Paul |last=Kaplan |title=MARTA reveals rail stop finalists; Northern extension depends on funding |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2006-10-22}}</ref> Expansion of MARTA service to [[Georgia State Route 70|Fulton Industrial Boulevard]] through the use of both heavy rail extension and bus rapid transit has been proposed as an extension of the West Line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/westline.htm  |title= West Line Corridor Details|publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref>  Bus rapid transit from downtown Atlanta to the [[Mall at Stonecrest]] has been proposed to provide additional public transit on the [[Interstate 20|I-20]] east corridor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/i20east.htm |title= I-20 East Corridor Details|publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref>  Finally, a proposal has been made to enhance service between [[Lindbergh Center (MARTA station)|Lindbergh Center]] and [[Emory University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/planstudy.htm |title= MARTA Planning Corridors |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref>

Additional expansion plans for MARTA and other metro Atlanta transportation agencies are detailed in [[Mobility 2030 (Atlanta)|Mobility 2030]] a timeline by the [[Atlanta Regional Commission]] for improving transit through the year 2030.

==Criticism and concern==
Criticism of MARTA has originated from many different groups.  Opponents of MARTA are critical of MARTA's perceived inefficiency and wasteful spending.  Supporters of MARTA are critical of the lack of state and regional support of MARTA.  In recent years additional concerns have been raised regarding criminal activity on MARTA, the reliability of service, as well as the governing structure of MARTA.   
===Lack of regional financial support===
Since the formation of MARTA, the Georgia state government has never contributed to MARTA operational funding.  Currently, MARTA is the largest mass transportation system in the United States not to receive state funding.<ref name=cloaf/>  Revenue from the Georgia motor [[fuel tax]] is currently restricted to roads and bridges and cannot be used for public transportation, further complicating potential sources of state funding for MARTA.<ref name=bullard/>  In addition, the other largest three suburban counties ([[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]], and [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] counties) have refused to join or fund MARTA.  Both Gwinnett and Clayton counties initially agreed to join MARTA but refused MARTA rail and bus service when voters in their respective counties voted against paying to help fund the system. These two counties along with [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]] have instead created their own independent bus systems: [[Cobb Community Transit]] on [[July 10]], [[1989]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dot.cobbcountyga.gov/cct/cct-history.htm |title=Cobb Community Transit (CCT) History |accessdate=2008-02-29 |publisher=Cobb County Department of Transportation}}</ref> [[Gwinnett County Transit]] on [[November 5]], [[2001]],<ref name=RTAP/> and [[Clayton County C-TRAN]] on [[October 1]], [[2001]].<ref name=RTAP/> A separate regional bus transit service, Xpress, is operated by the [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] in partnership with 11 metro Atlanta counties including Fulton and DeKalb, which began service on [[June 6]], [[2004]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xpressga.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=9&Itemid=45|title=About Xpress|accessdate=2008-02-29 |publisher=Georgia Regional Transportation Authority}}</ref> 

Due to its limited funding from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]] counties, MARTA has struggled for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area.  As a result, MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient.<ref name=cloaf/> Many people who own cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive their car to a MARTA rail station (instead of using bus service) if their job is near an adjacent one.  MARTA's financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.<ref name=cloaf/>

Although surrounding counties do not pay for MARTA, many of their residents use MARTA by driving directly to a MARTA station or by using a county or regional bus system which connects to MARTA.  A license plate study from 1988 to 1997 showed that 44 percent of the cars parked in MARTA park-and-ride lots were from outside of Fulton and DeKalb counties.<ref name=bullard/>  Current fare reciprocity agreements also allow non-paying counties to provide bus service for their residents which provide free connections to MARTA (see ''Fare reciprocity'').  According to a 2000 MARTA ridership study, 12 percent of MARTA riders live outside of MARTA's service area.<ref name=RTAP>{{cite web |url=http://www.grta.org/rtap/pdf_files/Ch_1_2.pdf |title=Task 1.2 Existing Transit Service Inventory |accessdate=2008-02-29 |format=PDF |date=2002-04-30 |work=Regional Transit Action Plan Technical Memorandum Number 2  |publisher=Manuel Padron & Associates, Inc. and URS, Inc.}}</ref>

===Effects of race on expansion and funding=== 	
It is often argued that racial politics also play a role in the operation and future service planning for MARTA. Opponents of Georgia's transportation policies have alleged a race-based two-tiered system, where billions are spent by the state on highway expansion to aid the commutes of mostly Caucasian residents of the suburbs, while service cuts at MARTA have hurt mostly African Americans.<ref name=cloaf/>  Supporters of MARTA have alleged that the lack of participation by other metro Atlanta counties is rooted in racism and classism.<ref name=cloaf/><ref>{{cite news | title=Alanta weighing transit expansion | date=1989-08-13 | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC1E3BF930A2575BC0A96F948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink | work =The New York Times | accessdate = 2008-02-24}}</ref>  In 1987, David Chestnut, then chairman of MARTA, stated, "The development of a regional transit system in the Atlanta area is being held hostage to race, and I think it's high time we admitted it and talked about it."<ref>{{cite news | first=William|last=Schmidt|title=Racial roadblock seen in Atlanta transit system| date=1987-07-22 | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DE153DF931A15754C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink| work =The New York Times | accessdate = 2008-02-27}}</ref>  It is alleged that because MARTA's service area includes some of Atlanta's most economically depressed and high crime neighborhoods, expansion of MARTA would allow crime to spread to suburban areas.<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=Firestone  | title=Overcoming a Taboo, Buses Will Now Serve Suburban Atlanta | date=2002-04-08 |url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E7D9123DF93BA35757C0A9649C8B63 | work =The New York Times |  accessdate = 2008-02-24 }}</ref>  Indeed, MARTA does serve mostly [[African-American]] riders.  A 1999 MARTA rider survey revealed that 78 percent of MARTA riders are [[African American]].<ref name=bullard/> Furthermore, MARTA is sometimes sarcastically said to stand for "Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta," a replacement [[backronym]], due to the relatively low number of [[White people|white]] riders, particularly after peak commuting hours.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=McCosh  |title=MARTA calls on marketers for image aid; Can soft drinks fill empty seats? |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution  |date=2001-02-11 }}</ref> White riders also express their unhappiness and discontent with the MARTA rail line due to perceptions that they are the most common or preferred targets of [[panhandler]]s and/or of potential robbery in or around MARTA stations themselves.

===Reliability of service===
[[Image:Marta construction.jpg|thumb|MARTA construction at [[Peachtree Center (MARTA station)|Peachtree Center]]]]
As is typical of rail transit in the United States, MARTA's rail lines have two [[Double track|parallel tracks]]. Any train failure or track work results in shared use of the other track by trains going opposite direction, a situation known as [[Single-line working|single-tracking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/gagan.htm |title=We're Building a Better Way |accessdate=2008-02-25 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref> There are no plans at this time to expand the number of tracks. MARTA is currently nearing the end of a complete replacement of tracks on all rail lines. Over the past few years, this replacement work has caused the agency to implement single-tracking on the weekends, which in turn has caused weekend patrons to experience less frequent service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/latest_news/singletrack.htm |title=MARTA Track Renovation Information |accessdate=2008-02-25 |publisher=Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority }}</ref> 

In the Summer of 2006, as a result of high summertime temperatures, many MARTA rail cars became overheated, damaging onboard propulsion equipment. As a result many trains broke down and had to be taken out of service for repair. This was further compounded by the fact that at any given time up to 50 older rail cars are out of service as part of MARTA's rail car rehabilitation project. To compensate for fewer cars MARTA shortened trains from 6 cars to 4 cars in length. Sometimes this resulted in almost half of the trains being shortened, resulting in crowded conditions for passengers.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=MARTA riders crowd heat-diminished fleet  |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2006-09-12 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}</ref>

===Board of Directors===
The composition of the MARTA Board of Directors is also criticized. The State of Georgia, Gwinnett and Clayton Counties do not support MARTA financially, but still have positions on the MARTA Board of Directors.<ref name=board/> Additional criticisms of the MARTA Board is that they are not elected, and thus not accountable to the citizens whom they represent. Furthermore, the Board members are also criticized for not being regular users of MARTA and thus are not actually aware of the concerns of MARTA commuters.

===Misuse of funds by employees for personal expenses===
In 2006 internal and external audits of MARTA corporate spending revealed personal charges on a pair of MARTA credit cards used by former General Manager and CEO Nathaniel Ford and two of his secretaries.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite news|url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | work=Atlanta Business Chronicle | last= Mahoney |first=Ryan| date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref> Ford's charges included $454.00 at a golf pro shop, $335.00 in clothing from [[Men's Wearhouse]] and a $58.00 visit to the dentist.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL"/> In response to the 2006 audit, Ford sent MARTA a check for $1,000.00 as reimbursement for the charges.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL"/>  Additional credit card with charges involving two of his secretaries, Iris Anthony and Stephannie Smart were also questioned. Smart used the cards to pay approximately $6000.00 in private expenses, and has agreed to repay this amount to MARTA.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL"/>
