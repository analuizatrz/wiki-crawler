The '''Orthoptera''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''orthos'' = "straight" and ''pteron'' = "wing") are an order of [[insect]]s with [[incomplete metamorphosis]], including the [[grasshopper]]s, [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s and [[locust]]s. Many insects in this order produce [[sound]] (known as a "[[stridulation]]") by rubbing their wings against each other or their legs, the wings or legs containing rows of corrugated bumps. Their [[ear]]s, located in the front legs, are interconnected in such a way that they are able to locate each other by sound.

==Characteristics==
Orthopterans have two pairs of [[insect wing|wings]]; the forewings are narrower than the hind wings and hardened at the base. They are held overlapping the abdomen at rest. The hind wing is membranous and held folded fan-like under the forewings when at rest. They have [[mandible|mandibulate]] mouthparts, large compound eyes, [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] length varies with species. Their hind legs are enlarged for jumping.

==Life cycle==
Orthopterans develop by [[incomplete metamorphosis]]or also called paurometabola. Most orthopterans lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in the ground or on vegetation. The eggs hatch and the young [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] resemble adults but lack wings and at this stage are often called ''hoppers''. Orthopterans are able to fold their wings, a condition entomolgist refer to as neoptera. Through successive [[ecdysis|moults]] the nymphs develop wings buds until their final moult into a mature adult with fully developed wings. 

The number of moults varies between species; growth is also very variable and may take a few weeks to some months depending on food availability and weather conditions.

==Orthoptera as food==
The Orthoptera are the only insects considered [[kosher]] in [[Judaism]]. Although the [[Bible]] may be read as stating that all Orthoptera are kosher except those, such as the [[mole cricket]], that do not jump, [[halakhic]] authorities state that only four species known in [[Yemen]] are kosher.
