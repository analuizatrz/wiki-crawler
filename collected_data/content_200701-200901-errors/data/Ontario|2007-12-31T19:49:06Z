'''Ontario''' ({{IPAEng|ɒnˈtɛɹi.oʊ}}) is a [[province]] located in the [[Central Canada|central]] part of [[Canada]], the largest by population<ref name="popont">{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/getcans/sorth.cgi?lan=eng&dtype=fina&filename=demo02a.htm&sortact=2&sortf=6|title= Ontario is the largest province in the country by population|work=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> and second largest, after [[Quebec]], ([[Nunavut]] and the [[Northwest Territories]] are larger but are not provinces) in total area.<ref name="areaont"/> Ontario is bordered by the provinces of [[Manitoba]] to the west, [[Quebec]] to the east, and the [[United States|American]] states of [[Michigan]], [[New York]], and [[Minnesota]]. Most of Ontario's borders with the United States are natural, starting at the [[Lake of the Woods]] and continuing through the four [[Great Lakes]]: [[Lake Superior|Superior]], [[Lake Huron|Huron]] (which includes Georgian Bay), [[Lake Erie|Erie]], and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]] (for which the province is named), then along the  [[Saint Lawrence River]] near [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]]. Ontario is the only [[Canadian Province]] that borders the [[Great Lakes]].

The capital of Ontario is [[Toronto]], the largest city in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo05a.htm|title=Toronto is Canada's largest metropolitan area|work=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> [[Ottawa]], the capital of [[Canada]], is located in Ontario as well. The [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census]] counted 12,160,282 residents in Ontario, which accounted for 38.5% of the national population.<ref name="ON2006MuniPops"/>

The province takes its name from [[Lake Ontario]], which is thought to be derived from ''ontarí:io'', a [[Huron language|Huron]] word meaning "great lake",<ref>{{cite book|last=Mithun|first=Marianne|year=2000|title=The Languages of Native North America|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=312}}</ref> or possibly ''skanadario'' which means "beautiful water" in [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studycanada.ca/english/about-ont.htm|pages=Last Paragraph-second last sentence|title=About Canada // Ontario|work=Study Canada|quote=Ontario's name is thought to come form the Iroquois word "Skanadario" which means "beautiful water"|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> Along with [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Quebec]], Ontario is one of the four original provinces of [[Canada]] when the nation was formed on [[July 1]], [[1867]] by the [[British North America Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/const/loireg/p1t1-1.html|title=The British North American act of 1867|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>

Ontario is Canada's leading manufacturing province accounting for 52 per cent of the total national manufacturing shipments in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|last=Government of Ontario|title= Ontario Facts: Overview|url=http://www.2ontario.com/facts/fact01.asp|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Ontario}}
{{seealso|List of Ontario counties}}
[[Image:Canada provinces evolution.gif|thumb|left|Evolution of the borders of Ontario]]
The province consists of three main geographical regions:
*The thinly populated [[Canadian Shield]] in the northwestern and the central portions which covers over half the land area in the province, though mostly infertile land, it is rich in [[mineral]]s and studded with lakes and rivers; sub-regions are [[Northwestern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]]. 
*The virtually unpopulated Hudson Bay Lowlands in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested; and 
*The temperate, and therefore most populous region, fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south where agriculture and industry are concentrated. [[Southern Ontario]] is further sub-divided into four regions; [[Southwestern Ontario]] (parts of which formerly referred to as Western  Ontario), [[Golden Horseshoe]], [[Central Ontario]] (although not actually the province's geographic centre) and [[Eastern Ontario]]. 
[[Image:DSCN0019.JPG|thumb|[[Bruce Peninsula]].]]

Despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the [[Canadian Shield]] which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the [[Niagara Escarpment]] which crosses the south. The highest point is [[Ishpatina Ridge]] at 693 m [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] located in [[Temagami, Ontario|Temagami, Northeastern Ontario]]. 

The [[Carolinian forest]] zone covers most of the southwestern section, its northern extent is part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] at the western end of [[Lake Ontario]]. The most well-known geographic feature is [[Niagara Falls]], part of the much more extensive Niagara Escarpment. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] allows navigation to and from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] as far inland as [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]] in [[Northwestern Ontario]]. Northern Ontario occupies roughly 85% of the surface area of the province; conversely [[Southern Ontario]] contains 94% of the population (see article [[Geography of Canada]]).

[[Point Pelee National Park]] is a peninsula in southwestern Ontario (near [[Windsor, Ontario]] and [[Detroit, Michigan]]) that extends into [[Lake Erie]] and is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland. [[Pelee, Ontario|Pelee Island]] and [[Middle Island (Ontario)|Middle Island]] in Lake Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of 42°N – slightly farther south than the northern border of [[California]].

The information regarding ethnicities below is from the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 Canadian Census]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2001 Census) (Ontario)|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=[[2005-01-25]]|accessdate=2006-11-29|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26g.htm Statistics Canada}}</ref><ref name="statcancomprof">{{Cite web|title=2001 Community Profiles|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=[[2006-12-14]]|accessdate=2007-01-12|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/Profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=35&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=ontario&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= Statistics Canada}}</ref>
The percentages add to more than 100% because of dual responses (e.g. "French-Canadian" generates an entry in both the category "French" and the category "Canadian"). Groups with greater than 200,000 responses are included. The majority of Ontarians are of British (English, Scottish, Welsh) and Irish ancestry.

The vast majority of Ontarians are of [[English Canadian|British]] or other [[White people|European descent]]. Slightly less than five percent of the population of Ontario is [[Franco-Ontarian]], that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11% of the population.

[[Immigration to Canada|Immigration]] is a huge population growth force in Ontario as it has been over the last two centuries, in relation to natural increase or inter-provincial migration. More recent sources of [[immigrants]]  with already large or growing communities in Ontario include [[Caribbean]]s ([[Jamaicans]],[[Trindadians]], [[Guyanaese]] ),  [[South Asia]]ns (for example, [[Pakistan]]is, [[India]]ns, [[Bangladesh]]is and [[Sri Lanka]]ns),  East Asians (mostly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Philippines|Filipinos]]), [[Central America|Central]]/South Americans, [[Eastern Europe]]ans such as [[Russians]] and [[Bosnians]], and groups from [[Iran]], [[Somalia]] and [[Western Africa]]. Most groups have settled in the Greater Toronto area. A smaller number have settled in other cities such as [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], and [[Ottawa]].

==Climate==
[[Image:Lake Ontario - Sandbanks Provincial Park 2001.jpg|thumb|Enjoying summer at [[Sandbanks Provincial Park]] on Lake Ontario.]]
Ontario has three main climatic regions. Most of Southwestern Ontario, plus the lower parts of the [[Golden Horseshoe]], has a moderate [[humid continental climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), similar to that of the inland [[Mid-Atlantic States]] and the lower Great Lakes portion of the U.S. [[Midwest]]. The region has hot, humid summers and cold winters. It is considered a temperate climate when compared with most of Canada. In the summer, the air masses often come out of the [[southern United States]], as the stronger the Bermuda High Pressure ridges into the North American continent, the more warm, humid air is drawn northward from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Throughout the year, but especially in the fall and winter, temperatures are moderated somewhat by the lower Great Lakes, making it considerably milder than the rest of the provinces and allowing for a longer growing season than areas at similar latitudes in the continent's interior. Both spring and fall are generally pleasantly mild, with cool nights. Annual precipitation ranges from 750 mm (30 inches) to 1000 mm (40 inches) and is well distributed throughout the year with a summer peak. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes and receive less snow than any other part of Ontario.
[[Image:LondonOntarioSkyline.jpg|thumb|The Thames river in [[London, Ontario]].]]
The more northern and windward parts of Southern Ontario, plus all of Central and Eastern Ontario and the southern parts of Northern Ontario, have a more severe humid continental climate (Koppen ''Dfb''). This region has warm to hot summers (although somewhat shorter than in Southwestern Ontario) with cold and somewhat longer winters and a shorter growing season. The southern parts of this region lie at the windward side of the lakes, primarily [[Lake Huron]]. The Great Lakes also have a moderating effect for shoreline areas. However, the open lakes frequently result in [[lake effect snow]] squalls on the eastern and southern shores of the lakes, that affect much of the [[Georgian Bay]] shoreline including [[Killarney, Ontario|Killarney]], [[Parry Sound District, Ontario|Parry Sound]], [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]] and [[Simcoe County, Ontario|Simcoe County]]; the [[Lake Huron]] shore from east of [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]] northward to the [[Bruce Peninsula]], sometimes reaching [[London, Ontario|London]]. Wind-whipped snow squalls or lake effect snow can affect areas as far as 100 kilometres (62&nbsp;miles) or greater from the shore, but the heaviest snows usually occur within 20 kilometres (12&nbsp;miles) from the shoreline. Some snowbelt areas receive an annual average of well over 300 cm (120 inches) of snow annually. 

The northernmost parts of Ontario  - primarily north of 50°N - have a [[subarctic climate]] (Koppen ''Dfc'') with long, very cold winters and short, warm summers and dramatic temperature changes from time to time. In the summer, hot weather occasionally reaches even the northernmost parts of Ontario, although humidity is generally lower than in the south. With no major mountain ranges blocking Arctic air masses, winters are generally very cold, especially in the far north and northwest where temperatures below -40 °C (-40 °F) are not uncommon. The snow stays on the ground much longer in the region as opposed to any other regions of Ontario; it is not uncommon to see snow on the ground from October to May here.

Severe [[thunderstorm]]s peak in frequency in June and July in most of the province, although in Southern Ontario they can occur at any time from March to November due to the collision of colder, Arctic air and warm, often moist Gulf air. In summer they form from convective heating. These storms tend to be more isolated in nature than those associated with frontal activity. [[Derecho]]-type thunderstorms can also occur in summer, often nocturnally, bringing severe straight-line winds over wide areas. These storms usually develop along stationary frontal boundaries during hot weather periods and most areas of the province can be struck. Only the Hudson/James Bay Lowlands region rarely experience one. The regions most prone to severe weather are Southwestern and Central Ontario, due to the effect of the localized [[Lake Breeze Front]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lake Breeze Weather|first=Keith C.|last=Heidorn|date=[[2005-11-01]]|accessdate=2006-11-29|publisher=The Weather Doctor|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/elements/lakebreezewx.htm}}</ref> [[London, Ontario|London]] has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, and is also one of the most active areas in the country for storms. [[Tornado]]es are common throughout the province, especially in the southwestern/south-central parts, although they are rarely destructive (the vast majority are classified as '''F0''' or '''F1''' on the [[Fujita Scale]]). In Northern Ontario, some tornadoes go undetected by ground spotters due to the sparse population; they are often discovered after the fact by aircraft pilots, who observe from the air the sections of destroyed forest left by them.

{{Main|Economy of Ontario}}
Ontario's rivers, including its share of the [[Niagara River]], make it rich in [[hydroelectric energy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2ontario.com/welcome/oout_508.asp|title=Ontario is rich in hydroelectricity, especially areas near the Niagara River|work=Ontario Facts|accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>  Since the privatization of [[Ontario Hydro]] which began in 1999, [[Ontario Power Generation]] runs 85% of electricity generated in the province, of which 41% is nuclear, 30% is hydroelectric and 29% is fossil fuel derived.  OPG is not however responsible for the transmission of power, which is under the control of [[Hydro One]]. Despite its diverse range of power options, problems related to increasing consumption, lack of energy efficiency and aging nuclear reactors, Ontario has been forced in recent years to purchase power from its neighbours, [[Quebec]] and [[Michigan]] to supplement its power needs during peak consumption periods.

An abundance of natural resources, excellent transportation links to the American heartland and the inland Great Lakes making ocean access possible via ship containers, have all contributed to making [[manufacturing]] the principal [[industry]], found mainly in the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region which is the largest industrialized area in Canada. Important products include [[motor vehicles]], [[iron]], [[steel]], food, electrical appliances, machinery, [[chemical]]s, and [[paper]]. Ontario surpassed Michigan in [[automobile|car]] production, assembling 2.696 million vehicles in 2004 (see [[Canada-United States Automotive Agreement]]).

However, as a result of steeply declining sales, on [[November 21]], [[2005]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America including two large GM plants in [[Oshawa]] and a drive train facility in [[St. Catharines, Ontario|St. Catharines]] which by 2008 will result in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. Subsequently in [[January 23]], [[2006]] money losing [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Co.]] announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012, Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the [[St. Thomas, Ontario|St. Thomas]] facility and the [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] casting plant. However, these losses will be offset by Ford's recent announcement of a hybrid vehicle facility slated to begin production in 2007 at its [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] plant and GM's re-introduction of the [[Camaro]] which will be produced in Oshawa. [[Toyota]] also announced plans to build a new plant in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] by 2008, and [[Honda]] also has plans to add an engine plant at its facility in [[Alliston, Ontario|Alliston]]. 

[[Image:Toronto Downtown Core at Night.jpg|thumb|left|[[Toronto]]: Ontario's capital city and Canada's largest metropolis.]]
[[Image:Niagara falls aerial.id.jpg|thumb|right|[[Niagara Falls]] is a major tourist attraction in Ontario as well as a huge supplier of clean [[hydroelectric energy]] for the province.]]
Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is the centre of Canada's financial services and banking industry. Suburban cities in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] like [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]],  [[Mississauga]] and [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]] are large product distribution centres, in addition to having manufacturing industries. The [[information technology]] sector is also important, particularly in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] and [[Ottawa]]. [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] is the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada and [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]] is a centre for petrochemical production. [[Construction]] employs at least 7% of the work force, but due to undocumented workers, the figure is likely over 10%. This sector has thrived over the last ten years due to steadily increasing new house and condominium construction combined with low mortgage rates and climbing prices, particularly in the Greater Toronto area. [[Mining]] and the forest products industry, notably [[pulp and paper industry in Canada|pulp and paper]], are vital to the economy of [[Northern Ontario]]. More than any other region, tourism contributes heavily to the economy of [[Central Ontario]], peaking during the summer months owing to the abundance of fresh water recreation and wilderness found there in reasonable proximity to the major urban centres. At other times of the year, [[hunting]], [[skiing]] and [[snowmobiling]] are among the out of high-season draws. This region has some of the most vibrant fall colour displays anywhere on the continent and tours directed at overseas visitors are organized to see them. Tourism also plays a key role in border cities with large casinos, among them [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Rama, Ontario|Rama]], and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] which attract many US visitors.

==Transportation== 
Historically, the province has used two major east-west routes, both starting from [[Montreal]] in the neighbouring province of [[Quebec]].  The northerly route, which was pioneered by early French-speaking fur traders, travels northwest from Montreal along the [[Ottawa River]], then continues westward towards [[Manitoba]].  Major cities on or near the route include [[Ottawa]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], and [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]].  The much more heavily travelled southerly route, which was driven by growth in predominantly English-speaking settlements originated by the [[United Empire Loyalists]] and later other [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, travels southwest from Montreal along the [[St. Lawrence River]], [[Lake Ontario]], and [[Lake Erie]] before entering the [[United States]] in [[Michigan]].  Major cities on or near the route include [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]], [[Toronto]], [[Mississauga, Ontario|Mississauga]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener/Waterloo]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]], and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].  Most of Ontario's major transportation infrastructure is oriented east-west and roughly follows one of these two original routes. 

===Road transportation===
[[Image:401atDVP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Highway 401]], running 817.9 km east/northeast from Windsor to the Quebec border is one of the busiest highways in the world.<ref name=Ontario/><ref name=Highway/>]]
[[400-Series Highways]] make up the primary vehicular network in the south of province and they connect to numerous border crossings with the US, the busiest being the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]] and [[Ambassador Bridge]] (via [[Highway 401]]) and the [[Blue Water Bridge]] (via [[Highway 402 (Ontario)|Highway 402]]). The primary highway along the southern route is [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]], one of the world's busiest highways <ref name=Ontario>{{cite web | title=Ontario government investing $401 million to upgrade Highway 401 | url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2002/08/06/c0057.html?lmatch=&lang=_e.html | accessdate=2006-12-20 | date=[[6 August]] [[2002]] | author=Ministry of Transportation (Ontario) }}</ref><ref name=Highway>{{cite web

[[Highway 400 (Ontario)|Highway 400]]/[[Highway 69 (Ontario)|Highway 69]] connects Toronto to Northern Ontario. Other [[List of Ontario provincial highways|provincial highways]] and regional roads inter-connect the remainder of the province.

===Water transportation===
The [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], which extends across most of the southern portion of the province and connects to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], is the primary water transportation route for cargo, particularly iron ore and grain.  In the past, the [[Great Lakes]] and [[St. Lawrence River]] were also a major passenger transportation route, but over the past half century they have been nearly totally supplanted by vehicle, rail, and air travel. There was previously a ferry connecting Toronto with [[Rochester, New York]].

===Rail transportation===
[[Image:otrain.jpg|thumb|The [[O-Train]], Ottawa's [[light rail]] train system (LRT).]]
[[Via Rail]] operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the [[Quebec City-Windsor Corridor]]. In addition [[Amtrak]] rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including [[Buffalo, NY|Buffalo]], [[Albany, NY|Albany]], and [[New York City, NY|New York]]. [[Ontario Northland]] provides rail service to destinations as far north as [[Moosonee, Ontario|Moosonee]] near [[James Bay]], connecting them with the south. [[Freight train|Freight rail]] is dominated by the founding cross-country [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[CP Rail|CP]] rail companies, which during the 1990s sold many [[Short-line railroad|short rail lines]] from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south. Regional [[Commuter rail]] is limited to the provincially owned [[GO Transit]], which serves a train/bus network spanning the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region, its hub in Toronto. The [[Toronto Transit Commission|TTC]] in Toronto operates the province's only subway and streetcar system, one of the busiest in North America. Outside of Toronto, the [[O-Train]] [[Light rail|LRT]] line operates in [[Ottawa]] with expansion of the line and proposals for additional lines.

===Air transportation===
[[Lester B. Pearson International Airport]] is the [[Canada's busiest airport|nation's busiest]] and the world's 29th busiest, handling over 30 million passengers per year. Other important airports include [[Ottawa International Airport]] and Hamilton's [[John C. Munro International Airport]], which is an important courier and freight aviation centre. Toronto/Pearson and Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier form two of the three points in [[Air Canada]]'s Rapidair triangle, Canada's busiest set of air routes (the third point is [[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]).  [[WestJet]] also operates many flights in the triangle. A third and new airline, [[Porter Airlines]] will be joining in the triangle making [[Toronto City Centre Airport]] their hub beginning late 2006 to early 2007. 

Most Ontario cities have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from [[Air Canada Jazz]] or smaller airlines and charter companies &mdash; flights from the larger cities such as [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Timmins, Ontario|Timmins]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[London, Ontario|London]], and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] feed directly into Toronto Pearson.   [[Bearskin Airlines]] also runs flights along the northerly east-west route, connecting Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, and Thunder Bay directly without requiring connections at Toronto Pearson.
 
Isolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on [[general aviation|air service]] for travel, goods, and even ambulance services, since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road or rail.

==Agriculture==
Once the dominant industry, [[agriculture]] occupies a small percentage of the population. The number of farms has decreased from 68,633 in 1991 to 59,728 in 2001, but farms have increased in average size and many are becoming more mechanized. Cattle, small grains and [[dairy]] were the common types of farms in the 2001 census. The fruit, grape and vegetable growing industry is located primarily on the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and along [[Lake Erie]], where tobacco farms are also situated. Tobacco production has decreased leading to an increase in some other new crop alternatives gaining popularity, such as [[Hazelnuts]] and [[Ginseng]]. The Ontario origins of [[Massey-Ferguson]] Ltd., once one of the largest farm implement [[manufacturing|manufacturers]] in the world, indicate the importance agriculture once had to the Canadian economy (see [[Geography of Canada]] for more detail).

==History==
===Pre-1867===
Before the arrival of the Europeans, the region was inhabited both by [[Algonquian]] ([[Ojibwa]], [[Cree]] and [[Algonquin]]) and [[Iroquoian]] ([[Iroquois]] and [[Huron]]) tribes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.on.ca/ont/portal/!ut/p/.cmd/cs/.ce/7_0_A/.s/7_0_252/_s.7_0_A/7_0_252/_l/en?docid=EC001034|title=About Ontario; History: Government of Ontario|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> The French explorer [[Étienne Brûlé]] explored part of the area in 1610-12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9016763/Etienne-Brule|title= Étienne Brûlé's article on Encyclopædia Britannica|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> The English explorer [[Henry Hudson]] sailed into Hudson Bay in 1611 and claimed the area for [[England]], but [[Samuel de Champlain]] reached Lake Huron in 1615 and [[France|French]] missionaries began to establish posts along the Great Lakes.

The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of Ontario. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]] ended the [[Seven Years' War]] by awarding nearly all of [[French colonization of the Americas|France's North American possessions]] ([[New France]]) to Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_%281763%29|title=The Treaty of Paris (1763)|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> The region was annexed to [[Quebec]] in 1774.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/qa_1774.html|title=The Quebec Act of 1774|accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref> From 1783 to 1796, the [[United Kingdom]] granted [[United Empire Loyalists]] leaving the [[United States]] following the [[American Revolution]] 200 acres (0.8 km²) of land and other items with which to rebuild their lives.<ref name="thefrenchshouldvewon"/> This measure substantially increased the population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence during this period, a fact recognized by the Constitutional Act of 1791, which split Quebec into [[The Canadas]]: [[Upper Canada]] southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and [[Lower Canada]] east of it. [[John Graves Simcoe]] was appointed Upper Canada's first [[Lieutenant-Governor]] in 1793.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~sprague/con91.htm|title=The Constitutional Act of 1791|accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref>

American troops in the [[War of 1812]] invaded Upper Canada across the Niagara River and the [[Detroit River]] but were successfully defeated and pushed back by British regulars, Canadian militias, and [[First Nations of Canada|First Nations]] warriors. The Americans gained control of [[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario]], however, and during the [[Battle of York]] occupied the [[York, Upper Canada|Town of York]] (later named [[Toronto]]) in 1813. The Americans looted the town and burned the Parliament Buildings, but were soon forced to leave. 

After the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Britain and Ireland rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this delibrate immigration shift was encouranged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers from Europe (mostly from Britain and Ireland) found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that would follow. Still, a mostly agrarian-based society, canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving relations over time. 

Meanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=People&PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada</ref>

Many in the colony, however, began to chafe against the aristocratic [[Family Compact]] that governed while benefitting economically from the regions resources, and who did not allow elected bodies the power to effect change (much as the [[Château Clique]] ruled Lower Canada). This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of [[responsible government]] rose in both regions; [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] led the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] and [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] led the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]]. For more on the rebellions of 1837, see [[History of Canada]].

Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] to investigate the causes of the unrest. He recommended that self-government be granted and that Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the [[French Canadians]]. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the [[Province of Canada]] by the ''[[Act of Union (1840)]]'', with the capital at Kingston, and Upper Canada becoming known as [[Canada West]]. [[Parliament]]ary [[self-government]] was granted in 1848. Due to heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade, and as a result for the first time the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of Canada East, tilting the representative balance of power.

An economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. 

A political stalemate between the French- and English-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during the [[American Civil War]], led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The ''[[British North America Act]]'' took effect on [[July 1]], [[1867]], establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Quebec]] and Ontario. The [[Province of Canada]] was divided at this point into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital at this time.

===From 1867 to 1896===
Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer [[Oliver Mowat]] became premier, and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. His battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than [[John A. Macdonald]] had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in [[Northern Ontario]], and fought tenaciously to ensure that those parts of [[Northwestern Ontario]] not historically part of [[Upper Canada]] (the vast areas north and west of the [[Lake Superior]]-[[Hudson Bay]] watershed, known as the [[District of Keewatin]]) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889''. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called ''Empire Ontario''.

Beginning with Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]'s the National Policy (1879) and the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (1875-1885) through [[Northern Ontario]] and the [[Prairies]] to [[British Columbia]], Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increase slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but only for a few short years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railroad to the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie Provinces]] and [[British Columbia]].

===From 1896 to the present===
[[Mineral]] exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast like [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]] and [[Timmins, Ontario|Timmins]]. The province harnessed its water power to generate [[hydro-electric power]], and created the state-controlled [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]], later [[Ontario Hydro]]. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The [[Ford Motor Company]] of Canada was established in 1904. [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] of Canada Ltd. was formed in 1918. The motor vehicle industry would go on to become the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy.

In July 1912, the Conservative government of Sir [[James P. Whitney]] issued [[Regulation 17]] which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French-Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] denouncing the "Prussians of Ontario". It was eventually repealed in 1927.

Influenced by events in the United States, the government of Sir [[William Howard Hearst|William Hearst]] introduced [[prohibition]] of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the [[Ontario Temperance Act]]. However, residents could distill and retain their own personal supply and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, which allowed Ontario to become a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] by the government of [[George Howard Ferguson]]. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld.  In April 2007, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament [[Kim Craitor]] suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores, however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]]. 

The post-[[World War II]] period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario, and the [[Greater Toronto Area]] in particular, have been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and after changes in federal [[immigration law]], a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely [[Ethnicity|ethnically]] British province, Ontario has rapidly become very culturally diverse.

The nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result [[Toronto]] surpassed [[Montreal]] as the largest city and economic centre of Canada. Depressed economic conditions in the  [[Atlantic Canada|Maritime Provinces]] have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario. 

Ontario has no official language, but English is considered the ''de facto'' language. Numerous French language services are available under the [[French Language Services Act]] of 1990 in designated areas where sizable [[francophone]] populations exist.

==Government==
[[Image:Ontario-wordmark.svg|thumb|left|The wordmark of the Government of Ontario, featuring a stylized version of the provincial flower, the trillium.]] 
[[Image:Ontario Legislative Assembly, Toronto, May 2006.jpg|thumb|The Ontario Legislature Building at Queen's Park.]]
The ''[[British North America Act]] 1867'' section 69 stipulated "There shall be a Legislature for Ontario consisting of the [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] and of One House, styled the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]." The assembly has 107 seats representing [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]]s elected in a [[first-past-the-post]] system across the province. The legislative buildings at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] in [[Toronto]] are the seat of government. Following the [[Westminster system]], the leader of the party holding the most seats in the assembly is known as the "[[Premier of Ontario|Premier and President of the Council]]" (Executive Council Act R.S.O. 1990). The Premier chooses the [[cabinet]] or [[Executive Council of Ontario|Executive Council]] whose members are deemed "ministers of the Crown." Although the ''Legislative Assembly Act (R.S.O. 1990)'' refers to ''members of the assembly'', the legislators are now commonly called MPPs (''Members of the Provincial Parliament'') in English and ''députés de l'Assemblée législative'' in French, but they have also been called MLAs (''Members of the Legislative Assembly''), and both are acceptable. The title of ''Prime Minister of Ontario'', while permissible in English and correct in French (''le Premier ministre''), is generally avoided in favour of "Premier" to avoid confusion with the Prime Minister of Canada.
{{See|Monarchy in Ontario|Executive Council of Ontario}}

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Ontario}}
Ontario has traditionally operated under a three-party system. In the last few decades the liberal [[Ontario Liberal Party]], conservative [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]], and social-democratic [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] have all ruled the province at different times.

Ontario is currently under a [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] government headed by Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]].  The present government, first elected in 2003, was re-elected on 10 October, 2007 (see [[Ontario general election, 2007]]).

Federally, Ontario is known as being the province that offers the strongest support for the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. The majority of the party's present 106 seats in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] represent Ontario ridings. As the province has the most seats of any province in Canada, earning support from Ontario voters is considered a crucial matter for any party hoping to win a [[Canadian federal election]].

==Territorial evolution 1788-1899==
Land was not legally subdivided into administrative units until a treaty had been concluded with the native peoples ceding the land (see [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]]). In 1788, while part of the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)]], southern Ontario was divided into four [[districts]]: [[Western District, Upper Canada|Hesse]], [[Eastern District, Upper Canada|Lunenburg]], [[Midland District, Upper Canada|Mecklenburg]], and [[Home District|Nassau]].

In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the '''Western District''', Lunenburg became the '''Eastern District''', Mecklenburg became the '''Midland District''', and Nassau became the '''Home District'''. Counties were created within the districts.

By 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, [[Johnstown District, Ontario|Johnstown]], [[London District, Ontario|London]], Midland, [[Newcastle District, Ontario|Newcastle]], [[Niagara District, Ontario|Niagara]], and Western.

By 1826, there were eleven districts: [[Bathurst District, Ontario|Bathurst]], Eastern, [[Gore District, Ontario|Gore]], Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, [[Ottawa District, Ontario|Ottawa]], and Western.

By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, [[Brock District, Ontario|Brock]], [[Colbourne District, Ontario|Colbourne]], [[Dalhousie District, Ontario|Dalhousie]], Eastern, Gore, Home, [[Huron District, Ontario|Huron]], Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, [[Prince Edward District, Ontario|Prince Edward]], [[Simcoe District, Ontario|Simcoe]], [[Talbot District, Ontario|Talbot]], [[Victoria District, Ontario|Victoria]], [[Wellington District, Ontario|Wellington]], and Western.

In 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the [[Province of Canada]] and [[county]] governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The [[Province of Canada]] also began creating ''districts'' in sparsely populated [[Northern Ontario]] with the establishment of [[Algoma District, Ontario|Algoma District]] and [[Nipissing District, Ontario|Nipissing District]] in 1858.

The northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after [[Confederation]]. Ontario's right to [[Northwestern Ontario]] was determined by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in 1884 and confirmed by the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889'' of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.
