"'''Harry Truman'''" is a song written by [[Robert Lamm]] for the group [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] and recorded for their album ''[[Chicago VIII]]'' (1975), with lead vocals by Lamm. The first single released from that album, it reached #13 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]].

Written after the resignation of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the lyrics are a tribute to a former President that Lamm felt the American people could trust -- straight-talking [[Harry S. Truman]]. "America needs you, Harry Truman."

Despite its popularity at the time, "Harry Truman" only appears on two of Chicago's compilation albums ''Group Portrait (now out of print) and [[The Box (Chicago)|The Box]]''. It is rarely performed in the band's live shows.

This song was "performed" by Chicago in late 1974 as part of the 1975 ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' special, in which Chicago guitarist [[Terry Kath]] can be seen mocking the band's obvious lip-synching by holding cue cards depicting the song's lyrics [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o38X0whTrH4].
