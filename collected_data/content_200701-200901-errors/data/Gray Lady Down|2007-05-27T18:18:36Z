'''''Gray Lady Down''''' is a [[1978]] [[disaster film]] by [[Universal Studios]] which starred [[Charlton Heston]], [[David Carradine]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Ronny Cox]], and featured the first film role for a young [[Christopher Reeve]].

==Plot==
An aging, respected commander ([[Charlton Heston]]) is on his final [[submarine]] tour before his retirement. Returning to port, the submarine, USS <i>Neptune</i> (possibly a [[Skate]]-class or [[Nautilus]]-class attack submarine), is struck by a Norwegian freighter and sinks to the ocean floor. A [[US Navy]] rescue force commanded by [[Stacy Keach]] arrives on scene, but <i>Neptune</i> is perched on the edge of a precipice, at an angle that does not allow the Navy's [[Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle]] ([[DSRV]]) rescue submarine to complete its work.

A small experimental submersible, "<i>Snark</i>," is brought in to assist with the rescue. <i>Snark</i> is very capable, but run by a [[nonconformist]] navy misfit ([[David Carradine]]). The submersible is the only hope for a rescue and pulls off a miraculous rescue.

[[Ronny Cox]] plays Neptune's executive officer, scheduled to take over command from [[Charlton Heston]], [[Ned Beatty]] plays the <i>Snark</i>'s second crewman, and [[Christopher Reeve]] appears in his first film role in a bit part for the sharp-eyed viewer.

The movie re-used submarine special-effect footage from [[Ice Station Zebra (film)|''Ice Station Zebra'']], with that film's submarine (''Tigerfish'') appearing as the USS ''Neptune''.

The movie is adapted from the novel <i>Event 1000</i> by David Lavallee (1971).
