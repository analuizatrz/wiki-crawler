'''Physics''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], ''{{Polytonic | φύσις}}'' (''phúsis''), "[[nature]]" and ''{{Polytonic | φυσικῆ}}'' (''phusiké''), "knowledge of nature")  is the [[science]] concerned with the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] and [[understanding]] of the fundamental laws which govern [[matter]], [[energy]], [[space]], and [[time]]. Physics deals with the elementary constituents of the [[universe]] and their [[fundamental interaction|interactions]], as well as the analysis of systems  best understood in terms of these fundamental principles.

Because physics treats the core workings of the universe, including the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] details which underpin all [[atom|atomic]] interactions, it may be thought of as the foundational science, upon which stands the "central science" of [[chemistry]], and the [[earth sciences]], [[biological sciences]], and [[social sciences]]. Discoveries in basic physics have important ramifications for all of science.

== Introduction ==

Physics attempts to describe the natural world by the application of the [[scientific method]], including [[model (abstract)|modelling]] by [[theoretician]]s.  Formerly, physics included the study of [[natural philosophy]], its counterpart which had been called "physics" (earlier ''physike'') from classical times up to the separation of physics from philosophy as a [[positive science]] in the [[nineteenth century]], as the study of the changing world by philosophy.

== Connected studies ==

Many other sciences and fields of thought are related to physics. 

Discoveries in physics find connections throughout the other [[natural science]]s as they regard the basic constituents of the universe. Some of the phenomena studied in physics, such as the [[conservation of energy]], are common to ''all'' material systems. These often are referred to as [[law of physics|laws of physics]]. Other phenomena, such as [[superconductivity]], stem from these laws, but are not laws themselves because they only appear in some systems. Physics is often said to be the "fundamental science", because each of the other sciences ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[physiology]], [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], etc.) deals with particular types of material systems that obey the laws of physics. For example, chemistry is the science of matter (such as [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s) and the [[chemical substance]]s that they form in the bulk. The structure, reactivity, and properties of a [[chemical compound]] are determined by the properties of the underlying molecules, which can be described by areas of physics such as [[quantum mechanics]] (called in this case [[quantum chemistry]]), [[thermodynamics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. <small>(Refer to [[Physics#Branches of physics|Branches of physics]])</small>

[[Image:Universe.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The deepest visible-light image of the [[universe]], the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]]]
Physics relies on [[mathematics]], which provides the logical framework in which physical laws can be precisely formulated and their predictions quantified. Physical [[definitions]], [[model (abstract)|models]] and [[theory|theories]] are invariably expressed using mathematical relations. There is a large area of [[research]] intermediate between physics and mathematics, known as [[mathematical physics]].

As [[analytic solution]]s are not always possible, [[numerical analysis]] and [[simulation#computer simulation|simulations]] must be utilized. Thus, [[scientific computing|scientific computation]] is an integral part of physics, and the field of [[computational physics]] is an active area of research.      

Physics is also closely related to [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. For instance, [[electrical engineering]] is the study of the practical application of [[electromagnetism]]. [[Statics]], a subfield of [[mechanics]], is responsible for the building of [[bridge]]s. Further, [[physicist]]s, or practitioners of physics, [[invention|invent]] and design processes and [[tool|device]]s, such as the [[transistor]], whether in [[basic research|basic]] or [[applied research]]. [[Experiment|Experimental]] physicists design and perform experiments with [[particle accelerator]]s, [[nuclear reactor]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[synchrotron]]s, [[cyclotron]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, [[laser]]s, and other equipment. 

Beyond the known universe, the field of [[theoretical physics]] also deals with [[hypothetical]] issues, such as [[parallel universes]], a [[Multiverse (science)|multiverse]], or whether the universe could have expanded as predominantly [[antimatter]] rather than [[matter]].

== Branches of physics ==

[[Physicist]]s study a wide range of physical phenomena, from [[quark]]s to [[black hole]]s, from individual atoms to the many-body systems of [[superconductor]]s.

=== Central theories ===

While physics deals with a wide variety of systems, there are certain theories that are used by all physicists. Each of these theories was experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of [[classical mechanics]] accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research; for instance, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] ([[1642]]–[[1727]]). These "central theories" are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them.

* [[Classical mechanics]] is a model of the physics of [[force]]s acting upon bodies. It is often referred to as "Newtonian mechanics" after Newton and his laws of motion. Classical mechanics is subdivided into [[statics]] (which models objects at rest), [[kinematics]] (which models objects in motion), and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (which models objects subjected to forces). See also [[mechanics]].
* [[Electromagnetism]], or electromagnetic theory, is the physics of the [[electromagnetic field]]: a [[field (physics)|field]], encompassing all of [[space]], which exerts a [[force]] on those [[Elementary particle|particle]]s that possess the property of [[electric charge]], and is in turn affected by the presence and motion of such particles. Electromagnetism encompasses various real-world ''electromagnetic phenomena''.
* [[Thermodynamics]] is the branch of physics that deals with the action of [[heat]] and the conversions from one to another of various forms of [[energy]]. Thermodynamics is particularly concerned with how these affect [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[volume]], [[action (physics)|mechanical action]], and [[work]]. Historically, it grew out of efforts to construct more efficient [[heat engines]] — devices for extracting useful work from expanding hot gases
* [[Statistical mechanics]], a related theory, is the branch of physics that analyzes [[macroscopic]] [[thermodynamic system|systems]] by applying [[statistics|statistical principles]] to their microscopic constituents and, thus, can be used to calculate the ''thermodynamic properties'' of ''bulk materials'' from the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] data of individual molecules.
* [[Quantum mechanics]] is the branch of [[theoretical physics|mathematical physics]] treating [[atom|atomi]]c and [[subatomic]] systems and their interaction with [[radiation]] in terms of observable quantities. It is based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called ''[[quantum|quanta]]''. Quantum theory typically permits only [[probability|probable]] or [[statistics|statistical]] calculation of the observed features of subatomic particles, understood in terms of [[wave function]]s.
* The [[theory of relativity]] consists of:
** [[Special relativity]], or "The Special Theory of Relativity", a physical theory based on [[postulates of special relativity|the postulates]] that: (1) the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is constant and independent of the source or observer and (2) the mathematical forms of the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] are the same in all [[inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]]. It leads to the assertion of the [[Mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]] and of change in [[mass]], [[dimension]], and [[time]] with increased [[velocity]].  Special relativity can handle accelerated motion.
** [[General relativity]], or "The General Theory of Relativity", an extension of the theory to include [[gravitation]].

=== Major fields of physics ===
[[Image:Meissner effect.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A [[magnet]] levitating above a [[high-temperature superconductor]] (with boiling [[liquid nitrogen]] underneath), demonstrating the [[Meissner effect]] — a phenomenon of importance to the field of [[condensed matter physics]]]]

Contemporary research in physics is divided into several distinct fields that study different aspects of the material world.

* [[Condensed matter physics]], by most estimates the largest single field of physics, is concerned with how the properties of bulk matter, such as the ordinary [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s we encounter in everyday life, arise from the properties and mutual interactions of the constituent atoms.  A [[magnet]] levitating above a [[high-temperature superconductor]] (with boiling [[liquid nitrogen]] underneath), demonstrating the [[Meissner effect]], is a phenomenon of importance to the field of [[condensed matter physics]].

* The field of [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]] deals with the behavior of a few atoms and molecules, and in particular the ways in which they interact with [[light]]. A large part of this field is now devoted to studying collective effects of a few million to billion atoms trapped in an [[Ultra high vacuum]], including states such as [[Bose-Einstein Condensate]]s. This research has strong connections to [[condensed matter physics]].

* The field of [[particle physics]], also known as "high-energy physics", is concerned with the properties of submicroscopic particles much smaller than atoms, including the [[elementary particle]]s from which all other units of matter are constructed.

* Finally, the field of [[astrophysics]] applies the laws of physics to explain [[celestial]] phenomena, ranging from the [[Sun]] and the other objects in the [[solar system]] to the universe as a whole.

Since the [[twentieth century]], the individual fields of physics have become increasingly [[specialization|specialized]], and nowadays it is not uncommon for physicists to work in a single field for their entire careers. "Universalists" such as [[Albert Einstein]] ([[1879]]–[[1955]]) and [[Lev Landau]] ([[1908]]–[[1968]]), who were comfortable working in multiple fields of physics, now are very rare.

Many fields and subfields of physics are listed in the table below.

== Classical physics and modern physics==

{{further | [[Classical physics]], [[Quantum physics]], [[Modern physics]], [[Semiclassical]]}}

Since the construction of [[quantum mechanics]] in the early twentieth century, it generally became evident to the physical community that it would be preferable for many known descriptions of [[nature]] to be [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]], that is, to follow the [[postulate]]s of quantum mechanics. To this effect, all results that were not quantized are called ''classical'': this includes the [[Theory of relativity|Special Theory and General Theory of Relativity]]. Simply because a result is classical does not mean that it was discovered before the advent of quantum mechanics. Classical theories are, generally, much easier to work with and much research still is being conducted on them without the express aim of quantization. However, there exist problems in physics in which classical and quantum aspects must be combined to attain some approximation or limit that may acquire several forms as the passage from classical to quantum mechanics is often difficult — such problems are termed ''semiclassical''.

Because relativity and quantum mechanics provide the most complete known description of fundamental interactions, however, and because the changes brought by these two frameworks to the physicist's world view were revolutionary, the term ''modern physics'' is used to describe physics which relies on these two theories. Colloquially, modern physics may be described as the physics of extremes: from systems at the extremely small ([[atom]]s, [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], [[Elementary particles|fundamental particles]]) to the extremely large (the [[universe]]) and of the extremely fast ([[special relativity|relativity]]).

== Theoretical and experimental physics ==

The culture of physics research differs from the other sciences in the separation of [[theory]] and [[experiment]]. Since the [[twentieth century]], most individual physicists have specialized in either [[theoretical physics]] or [[experimental physics]]. The great [[Italy|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] ([[1901]]–[[1954]]), who made fundamental contributions to both theory and experimentation in [[nuclear physics]], was a notable exception. In contrast, almost all the successful theorists in [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] (e.g. American [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemist]]  and [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[Linus Pauling]]) have also been experimentalists, although this is changing as of late.

Roughly speaking, theorists seek to develop through [[Model (abstract)|abstractions]] and [[mathematical model]]s theories that can both describe and interpret existing experimental results, and successfully predict future results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to explore new phenomena and test theoretical predictions. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon each other. Theoretical research in physics, however, may be considered further to draw from [[mathematical physics]] and [[computational physics]] in addition to experimentation. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot account for, necessitating the formulation of new theories. Likewise, ideas arising from theory often inspire new experiments. In the absence of experiment, theoretical research can go in the wrong direction; this is one of the criticisms that has been leveled against [[M-theory]], a popular theory in high-energy physics for which no practical experimental test has ever been devised.

=== Discredited theories ===
Scientific theories sometimes end up being discredited or [[Superseded scientific theory|superseded]].  In some of these cases the theory was announced prematurely and gained recognition before being discredited.  Other times an established theory is overthrown and a new one erected in its place.  Some famous examples are:

* [[Dynamic theory of gravity]] — Announced in a press release by [[Nikola Tesla]] in 1937, but never published
* [[Steady state theory]] — An established theory of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] in the early and middle [[twentieth century]], made obsolete by the success of [[Big Bang]] theory
* [[Luminiferous aether]] — An established theory in the late [[nineteenth century]], which was contradicted by observations and made "superfluous" by [[Theory of relativity|relativity]]
* [[Cold fusion]] — Announced in a press conference in 1989, but never confirmed. Still controversial
* [[Phlogiston theory]] — An established theory of the [[eighteenth century]] that attributed [[combustion]] to the liberation of ''phlogiston'' from a material

=== Phenomenology ===

[[Phenomenology (science)|Phenomenology]] is intermediate between experiment and theory. It is more abstract and includes more logical steps than experiment, but is more directly tied to experiment than theory. The boundaries between theory and phenomenology, and between phenomenology and experiment, are somewhat unclear and, to some extent, depend upon the understanding and intuition of the [[scientist]] describing these. An example is Einstein's [[1905]] paper on the [[photoelectric effect]], "''[[Annus Mirabilis Papers#Photoelectric effect|On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light]]''".

== Applied physics ==

[[Applied physics]] is physics that is intended for a particular technological or practical use, as for example in [[engineering]], as opposed to [[basic research]].  This approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the physical sciences, but is concerned with the use of scientific principles in practical devices and systems, and in the application of physics in other areas of science. "Applied" is distinguished from "pure" by a subtle combination of factors such as the motivation and attitude of researchers and the nature of the relationship to the technology or science that may be affected by the work.

{{further | [[Famous physicists]], [[Nobel Prize in physics]]}}

[[Image:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Aristotle]]]]
Since antiquity, people have tried to understand the behavior of [[matter]]: why unsupported objects drop to the ground, why different [[materials science|materials]] have different properties, and so forth. The character of the [[universe]] was also a mystery, for instance the [[earth]] and the behavior of celestial objects such as the [[sun]] and the [[moon]]. Several theories were proposed, most of which were incorrect. These first theories were largely couched in [[philosophy|philosophical]] terms, and never verified by systematic experimental testing, as is popular today. The works of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]], however, were not always found to match everyday observations. There were exceptions and there are [[anachronism]]s - for example, [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] and [[Indian science and technology#Astronomy|astronomers]] gave many correct descriptions in [[atomism]] and [[astronomy]], and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thinker [[Archimedes]] derived many correct quantitative descriptions of [[mechanics]] and [[hydrostatics]].

[[Image:Ibn_haithem_portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ibn al-Haitham]] (Alhazen)]]
The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers eventually resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the [[Scientific Revolution]] of the late [[seventeenth century]]. The precursors to the scientific revolution may be traced back to the important developments made in [[India]] and [[Persia]], including the [[ellipse|elliptical]] model of the planets based on the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[solar system]] of [[gravitation]] developed by [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]]-astronomer [[Aryabhata]]; the basic ideas of [[atomic theory]] developed by [[Hindu]] and [[Jaina]] philosophers; the theory of light being equivalent to energy particles developed by the Indian [[Buddhist]] scholars [[Dignāga]] and [[Dharmakirti]]; the optical theory of [[light]] developed by [[Islamic science|Muslim scientist]] [[Ibn al-Haitham]] (Alhazen); the [[Astrolabe]] invented by the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]] [[Muhammad al-Fazari]]; and the significant flaws in the [[Ptolemaic system]] pointed out by Persian scientist [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]].

As the influence of the [[Arab Empire]] expanded to Europe, the works of Aristotle, preserved by the [[Arab]]s, and the works of the Indians and Persians, became known in medieval Europe by the [[twelfth century|twelfth]] and [[thirteenth century|thirteenth centuries]]. 

[[Image:Mikolaj Kopernik.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (Mikołaj Kopernik), 1473-1543]]
This eventually led to the '''''scientific revolution''''', held by most historians (e.g., Howard Margolis) to have begun in [[1543]], when the first printed copy of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'' was brought to the influential astronomer from [[Nuremberg]] (Nürnberg), where it had been printed by [[Johannes Petreius]]. Most of its contents had been written years prior, but the publication had been delayed. 

[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Galileo]]]] Further significant advances were made over the following century by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Blaise Pascal]]. During the early [[seventeenth century]], Galileo pioneered the use of experimentation to validate physical theories, which is the key idea in modern [[scientific method]]. Galileo formulated and successfully tested several results in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], in particular the Law of [[Inertia]]. 

[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Sir Isaac Newton]]]] The scientific revolution is considered to have culminated with the publication of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in [[1687]] by the mathematician, physicist, alchemist and inventor Sir [[Isaac Newton]] ([[1643]]-[[1727]]).In [[1687]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], from which arise [[classical mechanics]]; and [[gravity|Newton's Law of Gravitation]], which describes the [[fundamental force]] of [[gravity]]. Both theories agreed well with experiment. The Principia also included several theories in [[fluid dynamics]]. 

Classical mechanics was re-formulated and extended by [[Leonhard Euler]], French mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Joseph-Louis Comte de Lagrange]], Irish mathematical physicist [[William Rowan Hamilton]], and others, who produced new results in mathematical physics. The law of universal gravitation initiated the field of [[astrophysics]], which describes [[astronomy|astronomical]] phenomena using physical theories.

After Newton defined [[classical mechanics]], the next great field of inquiry within physics was the nature of [[electricity]]. Observations in the [[seventeenth century|seventeenth]] and [[eighteenth century]] by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] created a foundation for later work. These observations also established our basic understanding of electrical charge and [[electric current|current]].

The existence of the atom was proposed in [[1808]] by [[John Dalton]].

[[Image:James Clerk Maxwell.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]
In [[1821]], the English physicist and chemist [[Michael Faraday]] integrated the study of [[magnetism]] with the study of electricity. This was done by demonstrating that a moving [[magnet]] induced an [[electric current]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]. Faraday also formulated a physical conception of [[electromagnetic field]]s. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] built upon this conception, in [[1864]], with an interlinked set of twenty equations that explained the interactions between [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. These twenty equations were later reduced, using [[vector calculus]], to a set of [[Maxwell's equations|four equations]] by [[Oliver Heaviside]].

In addition to other electromagnetic phenomena, Maxwell's equations also can be used to describe [[light]]. Confirmation of this observation was made with the [[1888]] discovery of [[radio]] by [[Heinrich Hertz]] and in [[1895]] when [[Wilhelm Roentgen]] detected [[X-ray]]s. 

[[Image:Einstein patentoffice.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Albert Einstein]]]]
The ability to describe light in electromagnetic terms helped serve as a springboard for [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of the theory of [[special relativity]] in 1905. This theory combined classical mechanics with Maxwell's equations.
The theory of [[special relativity]] unifies space and time into a single entity, [[spacetime]]. Relativity prescribes a different transformation between [[inertial frame of reference|reference frames]] than classical mechanics; this necessitated the development of relativistic mechanics as a replacement for classical mechanics. In the regime of low (relative) velocities, the two theories agree. Einstein built further on the special theory by including gravity into his calculations, and published his theory of [[general relativity]] in [[1915]].

One part of the theory of general relativity is [[Einstein's field equation]]. This describes how the ''stress-energy tensor'' creates curvature of [[spacetime]] and forms the basis of general relativity. Further work on Einstein's field equation produced results which predicted the [[Big Bang]], [[black hole]]s, and the [[expanding universe]]. Einstein believed in a static universe. He tried, and failed,  to fix his equation to allow for this. By [[1929]], however, [[Edwin Hubble]]'s astronomical observations suggested that the universe is expanding at a possibly exponential rate.

From the late [[seventeenth century]] onward, [[thermodynamics]] was developed by physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]], and many others. In [[1733]], [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] used statistical arguments with classical mechanics to derive thermodynamic results, initiating the field of [[statistical mechanics]]. In [[1798]], [[Benjamin Thompson|Thompson]] demonstrated the conversion of mechanical work into heat, and in [[1847]] [[James Joule|Joule]] stated the law of conservation of [[energy]], in the form of heat as well as mechanical energy. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the nineteenth century, is responsible for the modern form of statistical mechanics.

[[Image:Marie Curie (Nobel-physics).png|thumb|left|150px|[[Marie Sklodowska-Curie]]]]
In [[1895]], [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]] discovered [[X-ray]]s, which turned out to be high-frequency electromagnetic radiation.

[[Radioactivity]] was discovered in [[1896]] by [[Henri Becquerel]], and further studied by [[Maria Sklodowska-Curie]], [[Pierre Curie]], and others. This initiated the field of [[nuclear physics]].

In [[1897]], [[J.J. Thomson|Joseph J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]], the elementary particle which carries electrical current in [[electrical circuit|circuits]]. In [[1904]], he proposed the first model of the [[atom]], known as the [[atom/plum pudding|plum pudding model]]. Its existence had been proposed in [[1808]] by [[John Dalton]].

These discoveries revealed that the assumption of many physicists, that atoms were the basic unit of [[matter]], was flawed, and prompted further study into the structure of [[atom]]s.

[[Image:Ernest Rutherford.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ernest Rutherford]]]]
In [[1911]], [[Ernest Rutherford]] deduced from [[rutherford scattering|scattering experiments]] the existence of a compact atomic nucleus, with positively charged constituents dubbed [[proton]]s. [[neutron|Neutrons]], the neutral nuclear constituents, were discovered in [[1932]] by [[James Chadwick|Chadwick]]. The equivalence of mass and energy (Einstein, 1905) was spectacularly demonstrated during [[World War II]], as research was conducted by each side into [[nuclear physics]], for the purpose of creating a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]]. The German effort, led by Heisenberg, did not succeed, but the Allied [[Manhattan Project]] reached its goal. In America, a team led by [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] achieved the first man-made [[nuclear chain reaction]] in [[1942]], and in [[1945]] the world's first [[nuclear weapon|nuclear explosive]] was detonated at [[Trinity site]], near [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]].

In [[1900]], [[Max Planck]] published his explanation of [[blackbody radiation]]. This equation assumed that radiators are [[quantum|quantized]], which proved to be the opening argument in the edifice that would become [[quantum mechanics]]. By introducing discrete energy levels, Planck, Einstein, [[Niels Bohr]], and others developed [[quantum]] theories to explain various anomalous experimental results.

Quantum mechanics was formulated in [[1925]] by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and in [[1926]] by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]], in two different ways, that both explained the preceding heuristic quantum theories. In quantum mechanics, the outcomes of physical measurements are inherently [[probability|probabilistic]]; the theory describes the calculation of these probabilities. It successfully describes the behavior of matter at small distance scales. During the [[1920s]] Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and [[Max Born]] were able to formulate a consistent picture of the chemical behavior of matter, a complete theory of the electronic structure of the atom, as a byproduct of the quantum theory.

[[Image:Feynman-bongos.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Richard Feynman]]]]
[[Quantum field theory]] was formulated in order to extend quantum mechanics to be consistent with special relativity. It was devised in the late [[1940s]] with work by [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], and [[Freeman Dyson]]. They formulated the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]], which describes the electromagnetic interaction, and successfully explained the [[Lamb shift]]. Quantum field theory provided the framework for modern [[particle physics]], which studies [[fundamental force]]s and elementary particles.

[[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], in the [[1950s]], discovered an unexpected [[asymmetry]] in the decay of a [[subatomic particle]]. In [[1954]], Yang and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] then developed a class of [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] which provided the framework for understanding the nuclear forces (Yang, Mills 1954). The theory for the [[strong nuclear force]] was first proposed by [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. The [[electroweak force]], the unification of the [[weak nuclear force]] with electromagnetism, was proposed by [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam]], and [[Steven Weinberg]] and confirmed in [[1964]] by [[James Watson Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]]. This led to the so-called [[Standard Model]] of particle physics in the [[1970s]], which successfully describes all the elementary particles observed to date.

Quantum mechanics also provided the theoretical tools for [[condensed matter physics]], whose largest branch is [[solid state physics]]. It studies the physical behavior of solids and liquids, including phenomena such as [[crystal structure]]s, [[semiconductor|semiconductivity]], and [[superconductor|superconductivity]]. The pioneers of condensed matter physics include [[Felix Bloch]], who created a quantum mechanical description of the behavior of electrons in crystal structures in [[1928]]. The transistor was developed by physicists [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Bradford Shockley]] in [[1947]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].

The two themes of the [[twentieth century]], general relativity and quantum mechanics, appear inconsistent with each other. General relativity describes the [[universe]] on the scale of [[planet]]s and [[solar system]]s, while quantum mechanics operates on sub-atomic scales. This challenge is being attacked by [[string theory]], which treats [[spacetime]] as composed, not of points, but of one-dimensional objects, [[string theory|strings]]. Strings have properties similar to a common string (e.g., [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] and [[oscillation|vibration]]). The theories yield promising, but not yet testable, results. The search for experimental verification of string theory is in progress.

The United Nations declared the year [[2005]], the centenary of Einstein's [[Annus Mirabilis Papers|annus mirabilis]], as the [[World Year of Physics]].

== Future directions ==

{{main | Unsolved problems in physics}}

Research in physics is progressing constantly on a large number of fronts, and is likely to do so for the foreseeable future.

In condensed matter physics, the greatest unsolved theoretical problem is the explanation for [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. Strong efforts, largely experimental, are being put into making workable [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computer]]s.

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] have begun to appear. Foremost amongst these are indications that [[neutrino]]s have non-zero [[mass]]. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing [[solar neutrino problem]] in solar physics. The physics of massive neutrinos is currently an area of active theoretical and experimental research. In the next several years, [[particle accelerator]]s will begin probing energy scales in the [[TeV]] range, in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence for the [[Higgs boson]] and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]].
[[Image:First Gold Beam-Beam Collision Events at RHIC at 100 100 GeV c per beam recorded by STAR.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Thousands of particles explode from the collision point of two relativistic (100 [[GeV]] per nucleon) [[gold]] ions in the [[STAR detector]] of the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]]; an experiment done in order to investigate the properties of a [[quark gluon plasma]] such as the one thought to exist in the ultrahot first few microseconds after the [[big bang]]]]

Theoretical attempts to unify [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] into a single theory of [[quantum gravity]], a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet borne fruit. Currently, the leading candidates are [[M-theory]], [[superstring theory]], and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Many [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena have yet to be explained satisfactorily, including the existence of [[GZK paradox|ultra-high energy cosmic rays]], the [[baryon asymmetry]], the [[accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]], and the [[galaxy rotation problem|anomalous rotation rates of galaxies]].

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [[quantum]], and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena, involving [[complex systems|complexity]], [[chaos]], or [[turbulence]] remain poorly understood. Complex problems that would appear to be soluble by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics, such as the formation of sand piles, nodes in trickling [[water]], the shape of water [[droplet]]s, mechanisms of [[surface tension]] [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]], or self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections are unsolved. 

These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, not least of which has been the availability of modern [[mathematics|mathematical]] methods and [[computers]], which enabled [[complex systems]] to be modeled in new ways. The [[interdisciplinary]] [[relevance]] of complex physics also has increased, as exemplified by the study of [[turbulence]] in [[aerodynamics]], or the [[observation]] of [[pattern]] [[formation]] in [[biology|biological]] systems. In 1932, [[Horace Lamb]] correctly prophesied the success of the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the near-stagnant progress in the study of turbulence:
<blockquote>''I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.''</blockquote>
